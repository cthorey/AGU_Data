            "abstract": "From August 1 to September 23, 2013 the A16N Repeat Hydrography Cruise (US CLIVAR program) conducted a nearly longitudinal (~20-25°W) sampling transect of the Atlantic Ocean (63°N to 6°S) originating in Reykjavik, Iceland. Water column profiles were taken at 145 locations along this transect, and at 13 of these locations samples for total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) were also collected. Although profile depths for this cruise reached nearly 6000 m, Hg and MeHg sampling was limited to 12 discrete samples ranging from the surface to about the 1000 m. All samples were collected while observing strict adherence to trace-metal-free protocols. Upon collection from the rosette, each whole-water sample was immediately acidified to 1% HCl, thus our analysis of THg and MeHg includes both particulate and filter-passing fractions. For MeHg, our results represent a composite of both monomethyl and dimethyl mercury species. All samples were analyzed at the USGS Mercury Research Lab.\nOur results show several clear and interesting trends. First, an examination of THg versus MeHg reveals a bimodal distribution. Samples with THg > 0.03 pM show a highly correlated and linear distribution (R2=0.72) and a high mean percentage of MeHg (49%). On the other hand, samples with THg < 0.03 pM show a poor relation with MeHg and much lower %MeHg (9%). A depth discrimination of samples falling into these two regions of the bimodal THg versus MeHg plot shows that the vast majority of the results falling in the highly correlated region are from depths greater than 200 m, whereas the low %MeHg and poorly correlated samples were dominantly from 0-200 m depth. Similar to observations from other ocean basins, profiles of MeHg show clear subsurface peaks occurring between about 400-800 m depth. When examining the profiles in a north-to-south arrangement, an increasing trend is evident in the mean MeHg concentration of the subsurface peak, with maximum levels observed in profiles collected between 9 and 14°N. This region of the North Atlantic Ocean is associated with an oxygen minimum and PCO2 maximum zone both driven by degradation of sinking algal-derived organic matter. Last, the overall results from the Atlantic Ocean show a clear MeHg enrichment compared to similar data collected in the Pacific and Southern Indian Oceans.",

            "abstract": "Improving tropical cyclone (TC) forecasts is one of the most important issues in meteorology, but TC intensity forecasts are a challenging task. Because the lack of observations near TCs usually results in degraded accuracy of initial fields, utilizing TC advisory data in data assimilation typically has started with an ensemble Kalman filtering (EnKF). In this study, TC intensity and position information was directly assimilated using the EnKF, and the impact of these observations was investigated by comparing different assimilation strategies. Another experiment with TC wind radius data was carried out to examine the influence of TC shape parameters. Sensitivity experiments indicated that the assimilation of TC intensity and position data yielded results that were superior to those based on conventional assimilation of TC minimum sea level pressure as a standard surface pressure observation. Assimilation of TC radius data modified TC outer circulations closer to observations. The impacts of these TC parameters were also evaluated using the case of Typhoon Talas in 2011. The TC intensity, position, and wind radius data led to improved TC track forecasts and thence to improved precipitation forecasts. These results imply that initialization with these TC-related observations benefits TC forecasts, offering promise for the prevention and mitigation of natural disasters caused by TCs.",

            "abstract": "Over the next four years the EarthScope Transportable Array (TA) will install approximately 250 to 275 broadband seismic stations in Alaska and Western Canada. The station plans build on recent developments in posthole broadband seismometer design and call for sensors to be installed in boreholes 7 inches diameter, from 1 to 5 meters deep. These boreholes will be lined with PVC or steel casing, grouted in place. The proposed station locations are in a grid-like pattern with a nominal spacing of 85 km. Since most of these locations will only be accessible by helicopter, it was necessary to develop an ultra-light drilling system that could be transported to site in one sling load by a high performance light helicopter (i.e. AS350B2 or Bell 407) and still be able to drill the variety of ground conditions we expect to encounter.\nIn the past year we have developed a working prototype, gasoline-hydraulic drill rig that can be configured to run auger, diamond core or DTH tools, and weighs <1,300 lbs, including tooling. We have successfully drilled over 30 boreholes with this drill, including 12 for TA installations in Alaska and 13 at the Piñon Flat Observatory for testing sensor performance and placement techniques. Our drilling solution comprises:\n- Hydraulic system using a variable flow pump with on-demand load sensing valves to reduce the engine size needed and to cut down on heat build-up;\n- Rotation head mounting system on the travelling block to enable quick change of drilling tools;\n- Low speed, high torque rotation head for the auger, and an anchoring system that enables us to apply up to 5,000 lbs downforce for augering in permafrost;\n- Custom DTH that can run on low air pressure and air flow, yet is still robust enough to drill a 7 inch hole 2.5 meters through solid rock;\n- One-trip casing advance drilling with the DTH, steel casing is loaded at the start of drilling and follows the drill bit down;\n- Grout-through bottom caps for sealing the borehole casing and cementing it in place.\nOur next step is to build a dedicated DTH drilling system that will be light enough to mobilize to sites in one helicopter sling, including an air compressor. This rig is currently on the drawing board and we expect to build it this winter for field testing in the spring.",

            "abstract": "Fieldwork, at terrestrial sites that are analogous in some way to Mars, has a key role in defining questions addressed by Mars missions. For MSL, the question is whether its landing site was habitable, and for Mars 2020, the question is how do we search for and what are signs of life in ancient habitable environments. Implementing these investigations by means of a rover mission on a distant planetary surface has challenges due to a limited set of tools and period of operations. Using this context of planetary missions is important in shaping how analog research can be used to advance planetary science.\nFollowing a successful 2010 AGU fall meeting session entitled “Analogue Sites for Mars Missions”, two community workshops were held at The Woodlands, TX March 2011 and the Carnegie Institute of Washington in July 2013. These activities represent an ongoing dialogue with the analogue and mission communities. The AGU session solicited presentations of current analogue research relevant to MSL, at which time the landing site selection process was still considering four final sites. The 2011 Woodlands workshop solicited details on representative science questions and analogue sites by means of an abstract template. The output from The Woodlands workshop was an initial metric to assess the utility of analogue sites against specific science questions, as well as recommendations for future activities.\nThe 2013 Carnegie workshop, followed up on some of the recommendations from 2011. Both on-line interactive dialogue and in person discussions targeted broad topics, including 'the advantages and problems of using a great terrestrial analog for field testing', and 'knowing what we currently do about Mars, what would be the best place on the planet to collect the first suite of samples to be returned to Earth? What would be appropriate analog sites on Earth?'.\nThe results and recommendations from both workshops are summarized to publicize and stimulate this ongoing discussion.",

            "abstract": "Small mountainous rivers (SMRs) are characterized by episodic sediment delivery to marine environments, and have been recognized as a source of sediment gravity flows along storm-dominated coasts. These important modes of cross-shelf sediment transport are largely dependent on suspended-sediment concentration (SSC), bottom slope, and energy supplied by waves and currents. The mechanics and deposits of gravity flows are relatively unstudied on tidally dominated coasts receiving episodic SMR sediment discharge. Data collected during and after a March 2014 sediment delivery event from the small mountainous Elwha River (WA, USA) demonstrates the challenges of forming and preserving gravity-flow deposits in a persistently energetic tidal system. The river discharges to a narrow strait; near the river mouth, maximum boundary-layer tidal currents (50 cm above bed) reach 80–100 cm/s during spring tides and 30–60 cm/s during neap tides. Since 2011, the deconstruction of two dams has generated fluvial SSCs from 3 g/L to >9 g/L (max. monitoring value) during rainstorms and freshets. Instruments stationed near the river mouth since 2011 have shown that tidal currents advect this fine-grained sediment for days to weeks after delivery, and ultimately disperse it away from the river mouth. In March 2014, fluvial SSC reached ≥9 g/L during the largest river discharge since dam removal began. One day later, boundary-layer SSCs reached 2 g/L and 1 g/L at 23 and 102 cmab, respectively, and 5–8 days later, the bed under the instrument system aggraded by ~30 cm. Currents subsequently eroded the deposit, and within 3 weeks the bed elevation returned to its pre-event level. This is consistent with evidence of little to no grain-size change of the sand/gravel seabed in 10-60 m water depth up to 5 km from the river mouth since the dam removal began. To date, the only measurable accumulation of new sediment is in an embayment adjacent to the river mouth where currents weaken. These observations highlight the complexities of preserving fine-grained gravity-flow deposits in tidally dominated environments, where strong currents persistently transport them. On geologic time scales, marine sedimentary records of terrestrial events like floods and landslides may be sparse or absent on seabeds where tidal currents are strong.",

            "abstract": "Extreme hot spell events over the California Central Valley (CCV) are studied using their associated Large Scale Meteorological Patterns (LSMPs). The LSMPs include a ridge trough ridge spanning the north Pacific (Grotjahn and Faure, 2008; Grotjahn 2011, 2013, 2014). Climate models easily resolve the LSMPs even if they cannot resolve California’s complex topography and regional circulations. So, global models representation of CCV hot spells includes simulation of LSMP dynamics.\nWe compared hot spell dynamics in NCAR’s CCSM4 data with NCEP-NCAR Reanalysis (NNR) data. Normalized daily maximum temperature anomaly (using grid point’s long term daily mean, LTDM, and LTDM standard deviation) find 24 hot spell events in 1970-1999 CCSM4 simulations, similar to 22 events from NNR during 1981-2010.\nCCSM4 biases are as follows. The lower troposphere temperature anomaly LSMP is similar in NNR and CCSM4, though further inland in CCSM4 data. But, the strong anomalous sinking occurs further inland in NNR than in CCSM4 data, though CCSM4 has a stronger maximum sinking offshore (where NNR also is maximum). NNR and CCSM4 have offshore low level flow that is much stronger in CCSM4.  The mid to upper level ridge trough ridge LSMP spanning the north Pacific is much weaker in CCSM4 data, the much weaker trough upstream is a crucial bias. The wave activity flux (WAF) convergence upstream of the CCV before onset is thus much weaker in CCSM4, so CCSM4 relies more on local heat generation (consistent with stronger sinking and horizontal flow locally) to build the ridge along the west coast. Air parcel trajectories sink strongly just prior to onset, but prior to sinking, 2/3 of the NNR events have paths coming from far to the west, the remainder hover near the CCV before sinking. CCSM4 trajectories do not come from the west, most hover near the CCV or come from the south before sinking. CCSM4 is missing the dynamics responsible for a majority of the heat wave events observed.\nSuch thermodynamic and dynamic analyses will be applied to other CMIP5 (Taylor et al., 2012) climate simulations based on the availability of the data needed for the analyses.  CCV hot spells in future simulations will also be included, time permitting.",

            "abstract": "It was initially hoped that the proposed Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons (ASCENDS) NASA mission could rectify diurnal fluxes through it's ability to measure during both days and nights. However, initial simulation results (Kawa et al 2010) showed limited skill at identifying diurnal differences in fluxes. We investigate the possibility of (1) supplementing ASCENDS with well chosen in-situ surface sites and/or (2) adding distinct column measurements for the PBL and free troposphere into the inversion framework to determine the impact on recovering net ecosystem exchange (NEE), as well as distinct gross primary production (GPP) and respiration fluxes. In particular, we run forward simulations and inversions with distinct respiration and GPP fluxes calculated from the SiB model (Baker et al 2008) and test the ability of an EnKF based inversion framework to recover a hypothetical tropical CO2 fertilization effect resulting in enhanced GPP.\nBaker, I.

            "abstract": "Supply-transport feedbacks in catchments involve processes with fundamental consequence for river management, land use and for the prediction of climate-driven sediment fluxes in rivers that are yet little understand. We address the spatial variability in the dynamic of the suspended sediment discharge (Qs, M/T) in a mountain-piedmont system located in the southern-central Andes (Biobío River Basin, 37-39°S). In steep catchments, the Q vs. Qs diagrams show a marked seasonal hysteresis curve. In the piedmont, Qs is proportional to Q, without showing hysteresis. The contrast in the hysteresis pattern between catchments with different topographies can be explained by differences in the routing of rainfall-derived water. In the piedmont, most of the rainfall is converted into surface runoff because the water table level is near the surface. In the mountain, groundwater storage imposes large seasonal variations in the fraction of Q that flows at the surface and transports sediment from the hillslopes, which produces hysteresis. By separating the total Q between two frequency components (direct discharge, Qd and base-flow, Qb), we observe the response of Qs to the fraction of water that quickly leaves the catchment after a rainfall event (Qd). Similar results between the mountain and piedmont and the absence of hysteresis simplify the behavior of Qs by a linear relationship with Qd over the entire catchment. Our finding highlight the importance of an adequate hydrological model to understand the erosion and transport processes of a catchment and lead us to propose that the main erosion process along the Biobío catchment is overland flow.",

            "abstract": "OpenTopography (OT) is a geoinformatics-based data facility initiated in 2009 for democratizing access to high-resolution topographic data, derived products, and tools. Hosted at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), OT utilizes cyberinfrastructure, including large-scale data management, high-performance computing, and service-oriented architectures to provide efficient Web based access to large, high-resolution topographic datasets. OT collocates data with processing tools to enable users to quickly access custom data and derived products for their application. OT’s ongoing R&D efforts aim to solve emerging technical challenges associated with exponential growth in data, higher order data products, as well as user base.\nOptimization of data management strategies can be informed by a comprehensive set of OT user access metrics that allows us to better understand usage patterns with respect to the data. By analyzing the spatiotemporal access patterns within the datasets, we can map areas of the data archive that are highly active (hot) versus the ones that are rarely accessed (cold). This enables us to architect a tiered storage environment consisting of high performance disk storage (SSD) for the hot areas and less expensive slower disk for the cold ones, thereby optimizing price to performance.\nFrom a compute perspective, OT is looking at cloud based solutions such as the Microsoft Azure platform to handle sudden increases in load. An OT virtual machine image in Microsoft’s VM Depot can be invoked and deployed quickly in response to increased system demand. OT has also integrated SDSC HPC systems like the Gordon supercomputer into our infrastructure tier to enable compute intensive workloads like parallel computation of hydrologic routing on high resolution topography. This capability also allows OT to scale to HPC resources during high loads to meet user demand and provide more efficient processing.\nWith a growing user base and maturing scientific user community comes new requests for algorithms and processing capabilities. To address this demand, OT is developing an extensible service based architecture for integrating community-developed software. This “plugable” approach to Web service deployment will enable new processing and analysis tools to run collocated with OT hosted data.",

            "abstract": "Since April 2012, the University of Delaware has operated a real-time water quality monitoring station at Bowers, DE, to determine the effect of nutrient loads from the Murderkill Estuary to the Delaware Bay. The Land Ocean Biogeochemical Observatory (LOBO; Hach/Sea-Bird Electronics) is deployed under a public dock, with support from the Kent County Board of Public Works and Delaware’s Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, and in collaboration with the USGS that operates a gauging station at the same site (01484085). Every hour the LOBO measures salinity, temperature, pressure, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, chlorophyll, CDOM, nitrate (NO3-) and orthophosphate (PO43-). Ebb tide measurements reflect conditions in the Estuary and flood tide measurements reflect conditions in Delaware Bay. Real-time data are available to the public at kentcounty.loboviz.com.\nUsing hourly data from the LOBO, we are able to assess the nutrient and particle exchange between the Murderkill and the Delaware Bay, as well as biogeochemical and ecological responses to this exchange. Primary production in the turbid Estuary is low and nutrients from the Murderkill are efficiently delivered to Delaware Bay, where O2 production response to nitrate influx is almost instantaneous. In the summer, during the day, nutrients originating in the Estuary (ebb tide NO3- > 50-60 μM) stimulate phytoplankton growth in Delaware Bay, indicated by chlorophyll increases and O2 supersaturation during flood tide. This suggests that the Murderkill and other similar tributaries are important nutrient sources to the Delaware Bay. We use a phase-sensitive analysis to extract data characterizing the Delaware Bay, and then use dissolved oxygen to calculate rates of primary production and respiration. Newly produced Delaware Bay phytoplankton (often > 40 µg Chla L-1) may be an important labile carbon source supporting respiration in the Estuary and its surrounding salt marshes.",

Currently, water level datums are tied to a geodetic reference frame at approximately 400 tide stations which have been surveyed with GPS, whereas water levels vary significantly in space even a short distance away from tide stations. The CVDCW captures the relevant spatial variability between stations and offshore by integrating ocean models, gauge data (water level analyses and/or GPS observations), sea level trends, satellite altimetry, and a geoid model.\nThe CVDCW will enable the use of Global Navigation Satellite System technologies (primarily GPS) for hydrographers and navigators. It will also be important for other users including oceanographers, environmental and climate scientists, surveyors and engineers. For instance, it will allow easier integration of hydrographic and terrestrial data, provide a baseline for storm surge modeling and climate change adaptation, and aid with practical issues such as sovereignty and the definition of the coastline. Once high and low water surfaces are complete, they will define a large portion of the vertical link between land and ocean, helping to delineate flooding thresholds and inter-tidal ecosystem zones and boundaries. \nHere we present an overview of the methodology using a set of prototype model results, and will outline features of interest for studies in coastal stability, climate change adaptation, and sea level change.",

When they are sufficiently well-resolved in time, paleoceanographic tracer proxy time series at multiple locations sample the propagation of tracer signals through the global ocean and can be used to constrain the ocean circulation, including during times of climate transience. Using a Green function approach, we derive a time-dependent solution for ML equilibrium calcite δ18O (δ18Oc) during the last deglaciation from a least-squares fit of eight benthic foraminiferal δ18O records to an estimate of the modern ocean circulation. Within uncertainty, inferred deglacial histories of ML δ18Oc in the Northern North Atlantic and in the Southern Ocean mixed layers are indistinguishable. A comparison of the derived solution to planktonic foraminiferal δ18O records is unable to disprove the null hypothesis that the modern ocean circulation persisted during the last deglaciation. In order to disprove the null hypothesis, it is necessary to reduce uncertainties in inferred ML δ18Oc histories, perhaps by including additional records. The utility of benthic records to reduce uncertainties is quantified, with implications for future paleoceanographic sampling strategies.",

            "abstract": "MODIS AOD retreivals using the Dark Target algorithm is strongly affected by the underlying surface reflection properties. In particular, the operational algorithms make use of surface parameterizations trained on global datasets and therefore do not account properly for urban surface differences. This parameterization continues to show an underestimation of the surface reflection which results in a general over-biasing in AOD retrievals. Recent results using the Dragon-Network datasets as well as high resolution retrievals in the NYC area illustrate that this is even more significant at the newest C006 3 km retrievals. In the past, we used AERONET observation in the City College to obtain bias-corrected AOD, but the homogeneity assumptions using only one site for the region is clearly an issue. On the other hand, DragonNET observations provide ample opportunities to obtain better tuning the surface corrections while also providing better statistical validation. In this study we present a neural network method to obtain bias correction of the MODIS AOD using multiple factors including surface reflectivity at 2130nm, sun-view geometrical factors and land-class information. These corrected AOD’s are then used together with additional WRF meteorological factors to improve estimates of PM2.5. Efforts to explore the portability to other urban areas will be discussed. In addition, annual surface ratio maps will be developed illustrating that among the land classes, the urban pixels constitute the largest deviations from the operational model.",

We compare modeled streamflow with observations from several rivers in the region (Mekong, Sittang and Irrawaddy). The VIC streamflow simulations matched observations quite well particularly for the Mekong basin with both forcings from NCEP as well as WRF; however, the simulation using the NCEP data has slightly higher correlation as well as Nash Sutcliffe efficiency than simulation using WRF data. All of the flux terms, precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), and runoff (Q) from all the three sources (VIC-NCEP, VIC-WRF and ERA-INT) had similar seasonal patterns. However, ERA-INT ET had considerably lower seasonal variability than the other two models. While the VIC model balances the surface water budget by construct, the non-closure for ERA-INT was 7.1% of the annual mean P for the SEA region overall. We compared precipitation elasticity and temperature sensitivity to assess the impact of changes in P and T on runoff. The entire SEA region taken together has an elasticity of 1.78, implying that a 1% change in P would bring on average a 1.78% change in runoff. The SEA region has a temperature sensitivity of -1.79% indicating that a 1°C increase in T brings about a 1.79% decrease in mean annual SEA runoff. Of the seven basins, Mekong runoff has the highest elasticity (2.38) and sensitivity (large negative: -2.61%); while Irrawaddy and Sittang runoffs have the lowest elasticity (1.52) and sensitivity (-0.85), respectively.",

            "abstract": "Debris-covered portions of a glacier alter surface energy fluxes relative to bare ice and can have a significant impact on total ice melt. The net volume and distribution of rock debris on a glacier surface is subject to continuous reworking and volume change from glacier dynamics, mass balance, erosion, englacial transport and debris evacuation at the terminus. While models of melt under debris have been developed and used extensively, very few studies have investigated the temporal evolution of debris cover. We used Landsat imagery to measure supraglacial debris-covered area change for 94 glaciers within the Shimshal and Hispar watersheds in Northern Pakistan over 32 years (1977-2009). Preliminary results show that the change in debris-covered area over the entire region is close to zero for the 32-year period, but analysis at an individual glacier scale shows a wide spectrum of area changes. We propose that these results complement the positive or stable glacier mass balances that have been observed in the Karakoram. Nine of the studied glaciers, comprising 62% of the observed glacierized area, are surge-type and eight surged between 1977 and 2009. Our results suggest that surge behavior can cause more rapid changes in supraglacial debris-covered area relative to non-surge type glaciers. The main motivation for this research is to identify the major factors and spatial and temporal scales that will best facilitate forward modeling of debris cover evolution.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to clarify and examine the characteristics of intracloud (IC) lightning leaders. IC leaders have been characterized in the literature in terms of the temporal evolution, the most active portion of the IC leader and electric field waveform characteristics. ICs are noted to vary widely in both waveform pulse characteristics and pattern; thus further characterization with supplementary data yields more insight to the physical characteristics of IC discharges.\nOptical emission by IC lightning has not been extensively studied - individual pulse contributions to optical emission are not well characterized and little has been concluded about overall IC optical emission. To address this we explore IC lightning and leader processes in the context of optical emission. Our study includes VLF measurements from the Huntsville Alabama Marx Meter Array (HAMMA), VHF measurements from the North Alabama Lightning Mapping Array (NALMA) and optical measurements from the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS).\nThe data set compiled in this study consists of 345 IC radiation field pulses from 19 IC lightning flashes occuring on Oct. 25th, 2010 within 70km of the center of HAMMA. Waveform characteristics complied include initial half cycle width, rise time, pulse duration, peak amplitude (normalized to 100km) and LIS group associated within 2ms. With this data set we find that large amplitude (>1.0V/m) pulses are consistently associated with a LIS group; however small amplitude pulses (<0.5V/m) constitute 70% of radiation field pulses studied and are not always directly associated with a LIS group. Despite this, a LIS group can be associated with groupings of small amplitude pulses. We seek to understand the cumulative optical emission resulting from small and moderate amplitude pulses; this cumulative emission can exceed the LIS threshold. We compare waveform characteristics of the small amplitude pulses, particularly in terms of the large amplitude pulses which do result in a LIS group. Further, we examine the electrostatic field from flashes within 15km of the HAMMA array. Utilizing nearby IC ashes and LIS groups associated with electrostatic changes, a more complete picture of IC discharges is developed using charge neutralized, the resulting waveform and the related detectable optical emission and radiance.",

            "abstract": "The 2010 sinking of the Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico caused the release of ~5 million barrels of oil to the deep ocean. Roughly half of this oil, ~2 million barrels, is believed to have been trapped ~1000-1300 m deep in the water column, in plumes comprising water-soluble hydrocarbons in the aqueous phase and water-insoluble oil particles in suspension. While the soluble fraction was subject to rapid biodegradation, the fate of the oil particles has remained unknown. Using 17α(H),21β(H)-hopane (hopane) as a conservative marker of water-insoluble crude oil, we have examined the sediment data collected in support of the Natural Resource Damage Assessment process and identified a 3200-km2 depositional footprint surrounding the Macondo well. Under conservative assumptions, we estimate that this footprint accounts for ~12% of the suspended liquid oil. Monte Carlo modeling of the distribution of surficial hopane concentrations provides an initial estimate of the size distribution and spatial density of deposited particles, and suggests that the local spatial heterogeneity of particle deposition is likely to be extremely high, such that low-density sediment sampling is unlikely to capture the true extent of deposition. Thus, the 'missing' oil may be hiding in plain sight. Finally, we examined the spatial and temporal concentration distribution of >100 hydrocarbon compounds in relation to hopane, finding that, while there is clear evidence for biodegradation of many compounds, biodegradative efficiency appears to be impeded by high concentrations of oil, perhaps reflecting the low surface area to volume ratio of large oil particles.",

The effects of the Uemachi flexure zone are considered in constructing of lifelines and buildings. In this region, the geomorphological survey is difficult because of the regression of transgression. Many organizations have carried out investigations of fault structures. Various surveys have been conducted, such as seismic reflection survey in and around Osaka. Many borehole data for construction conformations have been collected and the geotechnical borehole database has been constructed. The investigation with several geological borehole data provides the subsurface geological information to the geotechnical borehole database.\nVarious numerical simulations have been carried out to investigate the growth of a blind reverse fault in unconsolidated sediments. The displacement of the basement was given in two ways. One is based on the fault movement, such as dislocation model, the other is a movement of basement block of hanging wall. The Drucker-Prager and elastic model were used for the sediment and basement, respectively. The simulation with low and high angle fault movements, show the good agree with the actual distribution of the marine clay inferred from borehole data in the northern and southern Uemachi fault flexure zone, respectively.

            "abstract": "Monitoring ground deformations in highly dense populated shoreline and lowlands areas such as Montreal is crucial for the sustainable development of urban infrastructures. Montreal already undergoes house foundations damages with a density of 8 repairs per square kilometer, especially over clay deposits such as in the Plateau neighborhood with a density of 89 repairs/km2. Using Radarsat-2 C-Band SAR interferometry, we observe a 3–5 mm ground LOS displacement variation temporally out-phased by three months relative to the 2 meter subartesian aquifer hydraulic head and river level variations, over a 60 km2 zone located in the central part of the Montreal Island in eastern Canada, from 2008 to 2010. Using ascending and descending SAR acquisition mode we extract the vertical component of the LOS velocities and observe secular displacements relative to a unconfined aquifer. These displacements are 2 mm/year subsidence on the minor topographic high, associated with evapotranspiration. We also observe ground water recharge and ~1 mm/year uplift downhill related to ground water discharge from deep regional aquifer enhanced with a faults system and shallow local aquifer arising from transmissivity. Displacements observed during this two year study are small but they are significant if integrated over the average lifetime of a house. We conclude that hydraulic head is related to the observed ground deformation in most of the areas of Montreal. Moreover, wetter climate conditions forecast for this area will definitely increase the aquifer dynamics; thus, more ground deformations are foreseen and have to be considered in future infrastructure design standards.",

Source fault of this earthquake is the same trend of Kego fault. Kego fault is one of the strike slip fault. This fault activity has a great deal to do with the history of Fukuoka plain. This research is funded by the integrated research project for the Uemachi active fault system in FY2011 by MEXT.\nHowever, detail of Kego fault are not make clear, therefore, from 2011to 2013, the integrated research project for the Kego active fault system by MEXT were carried out. In this project, we are corrected geotechnical borehole data, and make subsurface model for strong motion analysis. Geotechnical borehole data such as preparation of construction are collected over 17000 data. Especially, more than 12000 borehole data were collected in the Fukuoka plain. Although Kego fault is the strike slip fault; we can observe vertical displacement in the plain. Shimoyama et al (2005) were carried out of the geological boring survey along Kego fault at Yakuin area. The result of this study, the maximum vertical displacement of Kego fault in the plain is about 50m at the top of the basement rock. We used these geological information for understanding of geotechnical borehole data.\nThe result of this study, the displacement of Kego fault on the top of basement rock can recognized from Uminonakamichi to Shimodairi.

            "abstract": "Measurement of the coronal magnetic field is a crucial ingredient in understanding the nature of solar coronal phenomena at all scales. We employ STEREO/COR1 data obtained during minimum and maximum of solar activity (Carrington rotations, CR, 2066 and 2131) to retrieve and analyze the three-dimensional (3D) coronal electron density in the range of heights from 1.5 to 4 Rsun using the tomography method and qualitatively deduce structures of the coronal magnetic field. The 3D electron density analysis is complemented by the 3D STEREO/EUVI emissivity in 195 A band obtained by tomography for the same CR periods. A global 3D thermodynamic MHD model of the solar corona was used to relate the reconstructed 3D density and emissivity to open/closed magnetic field structures. We show that the locations of density maximum can serve as an indicator of current sheet position, while the locations of the maximum of the density gradient can be a reliable indicator of closed-open magnetic field boundaries. We find that the magnetic field configuration during CR 2066 has a tendency to become radially open at heliocentric distances above 2.5 Rsun. We also find that the potential field model with a fixed source surface (PFSS) is not consistent with the positions of the boundaries between the regions with open and closed magnetic field structures. This indicates that the assumption of the potential nature of the coronal global magnetic field is not satisfied even during the deep solar minimum. Results of our 3D density reconstruction will help to constrain solar coronal field models and test the accuracy of the magnetic field approximations for coronal modeling.",

The technology is famous for its low maintenance, non-invasiveness, continuous measurement, and most importantly, for its large footprint. Being more representative than point data and finer resolved than remote-sensing products, cosmic-ray neutron derived soil moisture products provide unrivaled advantage for mesoscale hydrologic and land surface models.\nThe method takes advantage of neutrons induced by cosmic radiation which are extraordinarily sensitive to hydrogen and behave like a hot gas. Information about nearby water sources quickly mixes a domain of tens of hectares in air. Since experimental determination of the actual spatial extent is hardly possible, scientists have applied numerical models to address the footprint characteristics.\nWe have revisited previous neutron transport simulations and present a modified conceptual design and refined physical assumptions. Our revised study reveals new insights to energy spectra, probing distance and water sensitivity of detected neutrons under various environmental conditions. These results sharpen the range of interpretation concerning the spatial extent of integral soil moisture products derived from cosmic-ray neutron counts. Our findings will have important impact calibration strategies, on scales for data assimilation and on the interpolation of soil moisture data derived from mobile cosmic-ray neutron surveys.",

            "abstract": "The frictional-to-viscous transition (FVT) in the vicinity of seismogenic faults experiences coseismic fracturing/frictional sliding followed by viscous creep during postseismic relaxation. A more complete understanding of these processes at the FVT is important owing to its control over the mechanical decoupling between crustal levels. However, well-preserved microstructural records from this depth are rarely preserved in exhumed faults because of progressive deformation and metamorphism in exhumation. We investigate quartz deformation microstructures from traverses across the Sandhill Corner shear zone, a strand of the Norumbega fault system (an ancient large-displacement, subvertical strike-slip fault system in the northeastern Appalachians) exhumed from FVT depths in order to characterize in greater detail the previously proposed architecture that divides the shear zone into an outer zone, inner zone and core. Trends in quantitative crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) and misorientation data from electron backscatter diffraction and 2D grain-size distributions confirm finer grain sizes within the inner zone and core, a weak CPO pattern and randomization in the misorientation of randomly selected grain pairs. Additional analyses with finer sample spacing and using fabric intensity indices (J- & M-Index), we show a progressive weakening of the CPO from the outer edges to the core and a decrease in grain size down to an average of 8 μm at the core, an average finer than previously reported.\nWithin the inner zone and core (ca. 30m width), the microstructural parameters are unusual: a weak CPO but a pattern clearly indicative of basal <a> slip. New deformation mechanism maps for different parts of the shear zone suggest deformation near the transition to grain size-sensitive creep. Our data confirms and builds new evidence for the model that during the seismic cycle, quartz grains within the core and inner zone experienced cycles of coseismic microfracture-assisted grain-size reduction, followed by postseismic viscous creep dominated by grain size-sensitive processes, and eventually transitioning to basal <a> slip with progressive grain growth. These observations and data suggest that coseismic damage may occur throughout the seismogenic zone adjacent to large-displacement faults.",

Type 2 clinopyroxene and garnet are relatively more enriched in Mg contents than type 1 ones. Type 2 eclogites are significantly more enriched in TiO2, P2O5, and light rare-earth elements, but more deplete in Al2O3 contents and Mg numbers. P–T estimates for both types eclogites are consistent with minimum pressures of 23–25 kbar at 830–920 °C, with the retrograde amphibolite facies assemblage of 15.2–17.5 kbar and 500–732 °C. Zircon U–Pb dating indicates that the protolith of type 1 eclogites, with normal mid-ocean ridge basalt affinity, emplaced at ~260 Ma, whereas the protolith of type 2 eclogites, geochemically familiar with oceanic-island basalt, erupted at ~242 Ma. 40Ar/39Ar analyses of hornblende from the retrograded eclogites indicate that the eclogite-bearing high-pressure rocks were exhumed at ~194 Ma. The occurrence of these high-pressure rocks implies the subduction of oceanic crust to a depth of ~85 km along the southern margin of the Qiangtang block during the Late Triassic, and the Bangong-Nujiang Meso-Tethyan ocean could have lasted over 160 Myr.",

            "abstract": "The Sumatra subduction zone is one of the most seismically active zones on the earth and has experienced great earthquakes in the last decade, including one of the largest earthquakes of the 21st century on December 26, 2004 (M 9.3) producing a devastating tsunami. Geodetic and seismological studies suggest that a part of the subduction is still fully locked and may produce a great earthquake up to Mw=9 in the coming future.\nIn order to understand the earthquake and subduction zone processes, we applied elastic full waveform inversion (FWI) on 50km deep seismic reflection data from Benkulu forearc basin. Data were acquired in partnership with CGG in 2009 using a 15 km ultra-long offset streamer, with shots every 50m and receivers every 12.5m. Unlike usual exploration data, the streamer was dived at 22.5m and the source was triggered at 15m. These characteristics provided wide aperture and low frequencies to the data which are required for FWI.\nTo match our modelling with the observed data before applying FWI, we first estimated the source wavelet from simulated far-offset signature. Then, the same pass-band filter was applied to both the source and the observed data from 1 to 15 Hz frequency bandwidth. Additionally, an f-k filter was applied to the real data to remove the remaining swell noise up to 4 Hz, without losing any useful signal. Our starting 2D Vp model was found by applying traveltime tomography to a smooth 1D model. Our Vs model was linked by empirical relationship to our Vp model.\nBy inverting first for far-offset refraction to recover the background velocity model and using a multi-scale strategy by going from 1Hz to 15Hz, we image the forearc basin down to 10km depth. We highlight the presence of a 10km wide low velocity structure at 3km depth. The sharp velocity change from 4km/s to 2km/s indicates the presence of gaz or fluid which could come from the mantle through the backthrust fault. The complexity of the sea floor makes the reflection challenging to invert but could give higher resolution. We are expecting improvement in the next months.",

            "abstract": "The Groundwater Program at the Alberta Geological Survey is focused on identifying, characterizing and quantifying Alberta's groundwater resources. Characterization of deep groundwater resources is becoming increasingly important as the Government of Alberta implements its Water Conservation Policy seeking to minimize freshwater use. Conducting an inventory of saline water (non-traditional) resources for source water in various energy development scenarios, at basin scales, pose significant challenges given the potential competing uses and demand for groundwater resources. Current research activities are seeking to improve our methods to characterize deep aquifers in data-rich sedimentary basins. Two methods are discussed here: 1) identifying production/injection influenced Drill Stem Test (DST) measurements for mapping distributions of hydraulic heads (both present-day and prior to development) in deep units; and 2) analyzing variable density flow effects.\nDSTs are transient pressure tests usually performed for assessing potential oil and gas productivity. These tests measure pressures using gauges at the surface and down-hole. The measured pressures can be strongly influenced in cases where the test interval is located in the vicinity of a production or injection well, which generally happens in mature sedimentary basins such as the Alberta basin. To identify production influences this study utilized a cumulative inference index (CII) based approach. A new application was developed in C-code to implement the CII and will be demonstrated on a sample DST dataset from the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin.\nFluid flow in sedimentary basins is often inferred using freshwater hydraulic heads, reference formation water densities and pressure-depth plots. Previous studies in the Alberta basin have often neglected density variations. Effects of density driven flow needs to be taken into account in cases where dense brines are present, a large aquifer dip or small hydraulic gradients exist. This study implemented a vectoral analysis to identify flow directions in regions where density driven flow is important and can change the inferred magnitude and direction of flow. A python based script has been developed and will be demonstrated on a sample dataset from the Williston basin.",

            "abstract": "Accumulation (precipitation minus evaporation or sublimation) is fundamental to understanding the mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS). Increases in accumulation rates over an ice sheet may be driven by the higher saturation vapor pressure with rising temperatures (e.g., Davis et al., 2005), and/or changes in atmospheric circulation patterns such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) (Appenzeller et al., 1998; Mosley-Thompson et al., 2005). Ground-penetrating radar data taken along the 2011 Greenland Inland Traverse indicate that northwest Greenland accumulation rates have increased approximately ~10% in the dry-snow zone over the past 50 years (Hawley et al., 2014), with differences in accumulation values more pronounced in the lower-elevation, coastal region near Thule. A similar pattern is also observed in snow pit data collected along the traverse when compared to traverse snowpit data from the 1950s. Accumulation rates derived from northwest Greenland shallow cores, however, indicate no statistically significant trend in annual accumulation (Bales et al., 2001; Buchardt et al., 2012). Here we present a compilation of precipitation (accumulation) instrumental and proxy records from the northwest GIS in an effort to reconcile these observations and improve our understanding of NW Greenland accumulation variability over the past ~100 years. Our analysis incorporates records from snowpits, shallow cores, and historical datasets including precipitation data from coastal meteorological stations (Cappelen et al., 2011). We assess the sensitivity of snow accumulation to factors including topography, temperature variability, and changes in atmospheric circulation. Preliminary analyses support the hypothesis that accumulation has been rising in coastal regions of the ice sheet for the past two decades without a significant trend further inland.",

            "abstract": "The internal structure of major strike-slip faults is still poorly understood, particularly how the deep structure could be inferred from its surface expression (Molnar and Dayem, 2011). Previous analogue experiments suggest that the convergence angle is the most influential factor (Leever et al., 2011). Further analogue modeling may allow a better understanding how to extrapolate surface structures to the subsurface geometry of strike-slip faults. Various scenarios of analogue experiments were designed to represent strike-slip faults in nature from different geological settings. As such key parameters, which are investigated in this study include: (a) the angle of convergence, (b) the thickness of brittle layer, (c) the influence of a rheological weak layer within the crust, and (d) influence of a thick and rheologically weak layer at the base of the crust. The latter aimed to simulate the effect of a hot metamorphic core complex or an alignment of uprising plutons bordered by a transtensional/transpressional strike-slip fault.\nThe preliminary results show that convergence angle significantly influences the overall geometry of the transpressive system with greater convergence angles resulting in wider fault zones and higher elevation. Different positions, densities and viscosities of weak rheological layers have not only different surface expressions but also affect the fault geometry in the subsurface. For instance, rheological weak material in the bottom layer results in stretching when experiment reaches a certain displacement and a buildup of a less segmented, wide positive flower structure. At the surface, a wide fault valley in the middle of the fault zone is the reflection of stretching along the velocity discontinuity at depth. In models with a thin and rheologically weaker layer in the middle of the brittle layer, deformation is distributed over more faults and the geometry of the fault zone below and above the weak zone shows significant differences. This latter experiment has significantly similar phenomena in reality, such as few pressure ridges along Altyn fault. The experimental results underline the need to understand the role of the convergence angle and the influence of rheology on fault evolution, in order to connect between surface deformation and subsurface geometry.",

            "abstract": "In CO2 sequestration operations, CO2 injected into a brine aquifer dissolves in the liquid to create an acidic solution. This may result in dissolution of the mineral grains in the porous medium. Experimentally, it is hard to investigate this process at the pore scale. Therefore we develop a new hybrid particle simulation algorithm to study the dissolution of solid objects in a laminar flow field, as encountered in porous media flow situations. First, we calculate the flow field using a multi-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann (LB) algorithm implemented on GPUs, which demonstrates a very efficient use of the GPU device and a considerable performance increase over CPU calculations. Second, using a stochastic particle approach, we solve the advection-diffusion equation for a single reactive species and dissolve solid voxels according to our reaction model. To validate our simulation, we first calculate the dissolution of a solid sphere as a function of time under quiescent conditions. We compare with the analytical solution for this problem [1] and find good agreement. Then we consider the dissolution of a solid sphere in a laminar flow field and observe a significant change in the sphericity with time due to the coupled dissolution – flow process. Second, we calculate the dissolution of a cylinder in channel flow in direct comparison with corresponding dissolution experiments. We discuss the evolution of the shape and dissolution rate. Finally, we calculate the dissolution of carbonate rock samples at the pore scale in direct comparison with micro-CT experiments. This work builds on our recent research on calculation of multi-phase flow [2], [3] and hydrodynamic dispersion and molecular propagator distributions for solute transport in homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media using LB simulations [4]. It turns out that the hybrid simulation model is a suitable tool to study reactive flow processes at the pore scale. This is of great importance for CO2 storage and Enhanced Oil Recovery applications.\n",

Yet, there is a perceptible lag in the abilities of the research community to capitalize on these new possibilities, due to lacking the relevant skill-sets, especially with regards to multi-disciplinary and integrative investigations that involve active collaboration.\nUC Santa Barbara’s National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), and the University of North Carolina’s Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI), were recipients of NSF OCI S2I2 “Conceptualization awards”, charged with helping define the needs of the research community relative to enabling science and education through “sustained software infrastructure”. Over the course of our activities, a consistent request from Earth scientists was for “better training in software that enables more effective, reproducible research.”\nThis community-based feedback led to creation of an “Open Science for Synthesis” Institute— a innovative, three-week, bi-coastal training program for early career researchers. We provided a mix of lectures, hands-on exercises, and working group experience on topics including: data discovery and preservation; code creation, management, sharing, and versioning; scientific workflow documentation and reproducibility; statistical and machine modeling techniques; virtual collaboration mechanisms; and methods for communicating scientific results. All technologies and quantitative tools presented were suitable for advancing open, collaborative, and reproducible synthesis research.\nIn this talk, we will report on the lessons learned from running this ambitious training program, that involved coordinating classrooms among two remote sites, and included developing original synthesis research activities as part of the course. We also report on the feedback provided by participants as to the learning approaches and topical issues they found most engaging, and why.",

The goal of water users is to adapt their management to achieve maximum profits. However, these decisions should take into account the environmental impact on the surroundings. Agricultural irrigation systems need to be viewed as a system that is an integral part of a watershed. Therefore changes in the infrastructure, operation and management of an irrigated area, has an impact on the water quantity and quality available for other water users.\nA strategy can be developed for decision-makers using an irrigation system modelling tool. Such a tool can simulate the impact of the infrastructure, operation and management of an irrigation area on its hydrology and agricultural productivity. This combination of factors is successfully simulated with the Ador model, which is able to reproduce on-farm irrigation and water delivery by a canal system. Model simulations for this study are supported with spatial analysis tools using GIS and remote sensing. Continuous measurements of drainage water will be added to indicate the water quality aspects. The Bear River Canal Company located in Northern Utah (U.S.A.) is used as a case study for this research. The irrigation area encompasses 26,000 ha and grows mainly alfalfa, grains, corn and onions.\nThe model allows the simulation of different strategies related to water delivery, on-farm water use, crop rotations, and reservoirs and networks capacities under different weather and water availability conditions. Such changes in the irrigation area will have consequences for farmers in the study area regarding crop production, and for downstream users concerning both the quantity and quality of outflows. The findings from this study give insight to decision-makers and water users for changing irrigation water delivery strategies to improve the sustainability and profitability of agriculture in the future.",

Better coordination of ES and livelihoods can be fatally undermined by existing institutional frameworks and through poor implementation and follow-up of policy decisions. This can have drastic impacts on resilience as the reality may be very different from the policy intentions.\nThe ESPA Deltas project integrates physical modelling, a multi-season social survey, scenario development and stakeholder engagement, and a governance analysis component has been incorporated into each. The project has comprehensively assessed the legal, policy and institutional context in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna Delta in Bangladesh, identifying barriers to legal and policy implementation through intensive stakeholder engagement and desk study at local, national and international levels. There has been a high degree of agreement in the findings from each of these independent processes and across the districts assessed.\nThis presentation illustrates how the governance research has been incorporated into the development of qualitative scenarios. It also demonstrates the extent to which policy implementation considerations have been factored into the biophysical modelling and social survey work. It identifies the challenges for adaptation strategies in Bangladesh, and draws on successful examples of policy implementation there (e.g. disaster management) to propose governance interventions that might enhance the resilience of delta inhabitants, especially in the light of the informal governance context. This research facilitates implementation of targeted governance interventions and supports the development of tools that can aid policy-makers in evaluating the impact of policy decisions on ecosystem services and livelihoods.",

Here we present field observations of a deeply eroded and uniquely well exposed section of caldera ring fault in a Tertiary central volcano in south-western Iceland. The Hafnarfjall ring fault represents the outermost fault complex of an elliptical caldera with an original diameter of approximately 5 km. Vertical displacement is estimated to be > 200 m on the steeply inward-dipping ring fault. Several thin (< 1 m) dikes occupy an approximately 5 m thick section within the ring fault; this region is interpreted to have once acted mechanically as the fault core with a lower stiffness or Young’s modulus than the surrounding host rock. Many faults which have been active over an extended period develop a damage zone around the fault core; this is a zone of high fracture frequency which is generally stiffer than the core but softer or more compliant than the surrounding host rock. We observe a number of inclined sheets, presumably originating from the part of the shallow magma chamber located the caldera margin, which become either arrested or deflected upon contact with the ring fault. Using the commercial numerical modelling software COMSOL, we offer a mechanical explanation for the deflection of inclined sheets into sub-vertical dikes at a mechanically stratified fault damage zone and core. A model is proposed whereby ring faults can act as a barrier for the propagation of inclined sheets away from a magma chamber within the caldera. Our findings provide an alternative mechanical explanation for magma channelling along caldera ring-faults, which is a process likely to be fundamental in controlling the location of post-caldera volcanism.",

            "abstract": "A changing climate along with human and animal population pressure can have a devastating effect on crop yields and food security in the Sudano-Sahel. Agricultural solutions to address soil degradation and crop water stress are needed to combat this increasingly difficult situation. Significant differences in crop success have been observed in peanut and millet grown in association with two native evergreen shrubs Piliostigma reticulatum, and Guiera senegalensis at the sites of Nioro du Rip and Keur Matar, respectively.We investigate how farmers can increase crop productivity by capitalizing on the evolutionary adaptation of native shrubs to the harsh Sudano-Sahelian environment as well as the physical mechanisms at work in the system that can lead to more robust yields. Soil moisture and water potential data were collected during a dry season millet irrigation experiment where stress was imposed in the intercropped system. Despite lower soil moisture content, crops grown in association with shrubs have increased biomass production and a faster development cycle. Hydraulic redistribution is thought to exist in this system and we found diurnal fluctuations in water potential within the intercropped system that increased in magnitude of to 0.4 Mpa per day as the soil dried below 1.0 Mpa during the stress treatment. An isotopic tracer study investigating hydraulic redistribution was carried out by injecting labeled water into shrub roots and sampling shrubs and nearby crops for isotopic analysis of plant water. These findings build on work that was completed in 2004 at the site, but point to lower overall magnitude of diurnal soil water potential fluctuations in dry soils. Using even the limited resources that farmers possess, this agroforestry technique can be expanded over wide swaths of the Sahel.",

High resolution images from the LANDSAT 8 satellite have been used to delineate the geological structures related to the potential geothermal reservoirs located at the northern end of the Southern Volcanic Zone of Chile.\nIt was done by applying the lineament extraction technique, using the ADALGEO software, developed by [Soto et al., 2013]. These structures have been compared with the distribution of main geological structures obtained in the field. It was found that the lineament density increases in the areas of the major heat flux indicating that the lineament analysis could be a power tool for the detection of faults and joint zones associated to the geothermal fields.\nA lineament is generally defined as a straight or slightly curved feature in the landscape visible satellite image as an aligned sequence of pixel intensity contrast compared to the background. The system features extracted from satellite images is not identical to the geological lineaments that are generally determined by ground surveys, however, generally reflects the structure of faults and fractures in the crust. A temporal sequence of eight Landsat multispectral images of Central Andes geothermal field, located in VI region de Chile, was used to study changes in the configuration of the lineaments during 2011.\nThe presence of minerals with silicification, epidotization, and albitization, which are typical for geothrmal reservoirs, was also identified, using their spectral characteristics, and subsequently corroborated in the field. Both lineament analysis and spectral analysis gave similar location of the reservoir, which increases reliability of the results.",

            "abstract": "Analyses of climate models have shown indications of climate change that are consistent with observations. This study focuses on the indications of climate change within the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) dataset. Specifically, an analysis was conducted to find climate change indicators within the global and northern polar region surface temperature data from 1980 to 2010. The expectation is that MERRA will show an overall temperature trend that agrees with observations during the thirty-year time period. The MERRA surface temperature data was gathered using the Climate Data Services (CDS) Application Programming Interface (API), which is a query based data retrieval interface developed by the NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS) at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). Since MERRA uses cylindrical projection, not all grid cells are equal in size. Spatial average areas, weighted by grid interval, were calculated to account for the non-linear grid spacing. Preliminary results of this spatial average indicate a thirty-year global temperature increase of 0.51K (0.017K/year). The study also finds that the northern polar region is warming at over double the global rate. This results in an increase of 1.20K (0.040K/year) over the thirty years. Observational data has been found to support these results. This support would lead to verifying that MERRA data does show a temperature trend that agrees with observational data. This poster will highlight the utilization of the CDS API, the results of the spatial average analysis, and the comparison of results with observational data.",

            "abstract": "Earlier this year the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) concluded a vulnerability analysis for the Metropolitan District of Quito (DMQ) in Ecuador. Vulnerability assessments were done for five sectors in the region: water resources, public health, agriculture, ecosystems and forest fires. This abstract focuses specifically on the vulnerability of the DMQ’s water resources to climatic and anthropogenic uncertainties.\nThis analysis focused on vulnerability of potable water supply for the city of Quito, as well as industrial and agricultural water needs. Current and future vulnerability was assessed in the face of a number of scenarios of climatic and non-climatic uncertainties. The assessment used an integrated water resources model developed by Quito’s National Polytechnic University for the surrounding Guayllabamba river basin. The model was built using the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) software, and encompasses the urban, rural/agricultural, and industrial demands throughout the basin, linking them with existing surface and ground-water supplies.\nFive future scenarios were constructed in the WEAP basin model out the year 2050 in order to assess their effects:\nUrban population growth (~70% by 2050).\nUrban population growth + rising mean air temperatures (~+2°C by 2050).\nUrban population growth + rising temperatures + drought (recurring 3-year drought cycles built into the projection) \nUrban population growth + rising temperatures + conversion of ‘paramo’ alpine tundra ecosystem into cultivated land. (WEAP allows the user to define various types of land cover extent throughout the basin, along with their unique physical characteristics to simulate rainfall-runoff. Conversion of ‘paramo’ land cover to agriculture was evaluated to see potential effects it may have on the system's hydrology)\nUrban population growth + rising temperatures + drought + conversion of ‘paramos’\nCoverage of demands in the model was used as the primary vulnerability metric, with urban demands experiencing supply shortages of up to 20-25% under the most stressful scenarios, a shortage which is dampened by significantly increased groundwater pumping. Rural and industrial demands suffer much more severe shortages, with nearly all demands going unmet in a number of scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Because changes in vegetation structure and function in the Arctic are rapid and highly dynamic phenomena, efforts to understand the C balance of the tundra require repeatable, objective, and accurate remote sensing methods for estimating aboveground C pools and fluxes over large areas. A key challenge addressing the modelling of aboveground C is to utilize process-level information from fine-scale studies. Utilizing information obtained from high resolution remote sensing systems could help to better understand the C source/sink strength of the tundra, which will in part depend on changes in photosynthesis resulting from the partitioning of photosynthetic machinery within and among deciduous shrub canopies. Terrestrial LiDAR and passive hyperspectral remote sensing measurements offer an effective, repeatable, and scalable method to understand photosynthetic performance and partitioning at the canopy scale previously unexplored in arctic systems. Using a 3-D shrub canopy model derived from LiDAR, we quantified the light regime of leaves within shrub canopies to gain a better understanding of how light interception varies in response to the Arctic’s complex radiation regime. This information was then coupled with pigment sampling (i.e., xanthophylls, and Chl a/b) to evaluate the optimization of foliage photosynthetic capacity within shrub canopies due to light availability. In addition, a lab experiment was performed to validate evidence of canopy level optimization via gradients of light intensity and leaf light environment. For this, hyperspectral reflectance (photochemical reflectance index (PRI)), and solar induced fluorescence (SIF)) was collected in conjunction with destructive pigment samples (xanthophylls) and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements in both sunlit and shaded canopy positions.",

            "abstract": "The world's coastal deltaic wetlands are threatened by relative sea level rise. Protecting these ecosystems requires understanding deltaic growth and few studies have focused on how vegetation influences this growth. Here we explore the ecogeomorphic evolution of Wax Lake Delta (WLD) using a remote sensing database consisting of 1083 Landsat 5 and 7 images (30 m resolution) from 1983 to 2012 and 23 high-resolution images (1.5 m resolution) from 2001 to 2012. We calculate each Landsat image to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which indicates the relative above ground vegetation biomass. We also use the high-resolution images and spectral signatures from Landsat images to classify land cover into vegetation, sediment, and water. Only imagery from peak biomass season, August and September for this subtropical ecosystem, was analyzed to control for the effects of interannual variability in growing season and growth rates on the estimates of vegetated areas. Additional analyses of extreme events and fluctuating water levels is needed to correctly estimate land area and areal vegetation coverage. Our results show from 1984 to ~1995 WLD experiences a period of emergence where total delta area and the vegetated percent (at peak biomass) increases rapidly. After 1995, the vegetated percent of WLD levels off, but fluctuates from 70% to 90%. During winter months this value drops to ~10%. Accordingly, the bare sediment percent decreases as one minus the vegetated percent. At individual island scale vegetated percent at peak biomass levels off at different times and values. Proximal (or older) islands level off as soon as 1995, fluctuating from 80% to nearly 100% vegetated, while distal (or younger) islands do so at 2000 ranging from 20% to 80%. It is unclear why this difference occurs, but we conjecture it is caused by the lower elevation of the distal islands or their aggrading slower than proximal ones as the incoming sediment volume spreads over a larger deltaic area. Our analysis suggests that vegetation can most effectively enhance delta sedimentation if sediment delivery occurs during peak biomass season.",

Typically above the marine boundary layer in the summer, this is an ideal site to study aerosol transported over long distances across the Atlantic Ocean. Aerosols reaching the Observatory often originate from North America and sometimes from Africa and Europe. Aerosols instrumentation deployed at the site include: a) an optical particle counter, b) a 7-wavelength aethalometer to measure black carbon equivalent mass concentration, c) a 3-wavelength nephelometer to measure total and backward light scattering, d) four high volume samplers for aerosol chemical characterization, and e) a sequential aerosol sampler and a 4-stage impactor to collect particles on different substrates for microscopy analysis. The origin and transport pathways of the air masses sampled at the site are determined using FLEXible PARTicle (FLEXPART) dispersion modeling retroplume analysis. Single particle morphology and mixing states were determined using electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and scanning transmission x-ray microscopy.\nThis study provides an overview of different types of aerosol collected at Pico Mountain Observatory. We investigated morphology and mixing of various types of particles, including dust, soot, salt and organic particles transported to the Observatory. Soot particles were often mixed/coated with other material and exhibited very compact shape. Dust particles were often mixed with sulfur containing species. We also observed dust particles that were mixed with coated soot particles. During some events, we observed soot and sulfate aerosol trapped within organic matter. The results of this study have implications on how aerosol particles and their internal mixing can be represented in numerical models for remote regions of the free troposphere.",

In 2013, partial dredging of the lake removed the upper two meters of lake sediment as part of a remediation effort. Prior to dredging, long and short cores spatially covering the lake and representing deep and shallow environments were recovered from the lake to preserve the paleoenvironmental record of one of the only natural lakes on the San Francisco Peninsula. The cores are curated at LacCore and are available for research by the scientific community.\nMountain Lake formed in an interdunal depression and was shallow and fluctuating in its first few hundred years. Lake level rise and inundation of a larger area was followed by lowstands under drier conditions around 550-700 and 1300 CE. Nonnative taxa and cultivars appeared at the time of Spanish settlement in the late 18th century, and the lake underwent eutrophication due to livestock pasturing. U.S. Army landscaping introduced trees to the watershed in the late 19th century. The upper ~1m of sediments document unusually high heavy metal contamination, especially for lead and zinc, caused by the construction and heavy use of Highway 1 on the lake shore. Lead levels peak in 1975 and decline towards the surface, reflecting the history of leaded gasoline use in California. Zinc is derived mainly from automobile tires, and follows a pattern similar to that of lead, but continues to increase towards the surface.\nOngoing research includes additional radiocarbon dating and detailed lithological analysis to form the basis of lake-level reconstruction and archeological investigations. Because the Presidio archaeological record does not record human habitation in the area until approximately 1300 years before present, the core analysis also has the potential to determine whether people lived at the tip of the SF peninsula as early as 2000 BP.\nIn October 2014 the Presidio Trust opened a Heritage Gallery that interprets the cultural and natural history of the park for the public. The Mountain Lake sedimentary record is an important component of this exhibit, which includes an epoxy-embedded core from the lake.",

            "abstract": "Clawpack, the Conservation Laws Package, has long been one of the standards for solving hyperbolic conservation laws but over the years has extended well beyond this role. Today a community of open-source codes have been developed that address a multitude of different needs including non-conservative balance laws, high-order accurate methods, and parallelism while remaining extensible and easy to use, largely by the judicious use of Python and the original Fortran codes that it wraps.\nThis talk will present some of the recent developments in projects under the Clawpack umbrella, notably the GeoClaw and PyClaw projects. GeoClaw was originally developed as a tool for simulating tsunamis using adaptive mesh refinement but has since encompassed a large number of other geophysically relevant flows including storm surge and debris-flows. PyClaw originated as a Python version of the original Clawpack algorithms but has since been both a testing ground for new algorithmic advances in the Clawpack framework but also an easily extensible framework for solving hyperbolic balance laws. Some of these extensions include the addition of WENO high-order methods, massively parallel capabilities, and adaptive mesh refinement technologies, made possible largely by the flexibility of the Python language and community libraries such as NumPy and PETSc. Because of the tight integration with Python tecnologies, both packages have benefited also from the focus on reproducibility in the Python community, notably IPython notebooks.",

            "abstract": "During the course of the Galileo Mission at Jupiter, the spacecraft obtained high-resolution observations of plasmas during 8 near encounters with Europa. Most typically, these encounters provided evidence of modest production of plasma within Europa’s exosphere, with ion densities comparable to that of the plasma sheet. However, plasma densities significantly greater than those of the surrounding plasma sheet were seen during two encounters. Once, as the spacecraft traversed the moon’s near-downstream wake with respect to the prevailing flow of Jupiter’s plasma sheet/plasma torus. Densities were several times higher than those of the plasma sheet, and entrainment of Europa’s ionosphere accounts for this observation. The other encounter occurred in the upstream region. Densities were an order of magnitude higher than usual, and this has been interpreted as potential evidence of ionization within a water plume. However, the usual signatures of fresh ion production that would be expected in a plume are not found in the ion energy-angle spectra. The observations and possible explanations are presented in this report.",

By the way, the surface air temperature increase of lower latitude region is weaker than the Arctic. The non-homogeneous heating affects zonal atmospheric circulation unfavorably and more wavy in meridional. Especially, increase of weather extremes, Heat waves, cold spells droughts prolonged wet periods are related to these amplification of atmospheric planetary waves.\n The thermal wind relationship is related to weakening north-south temperature gradient may cause larger amplitude planetary waves. In recent years, the north-south temperature gradient has been much weakened in Eurasia region (30E-90E) and intensification of waviness of zonal flow is shown. However, the waviness of Rossby wave intended from global warming is still disputable. More adequate methods need to understand under shortage of observation period. ",

As we make strides towards this goal and more data sets are exposed in online catalogs, a new challenge emerges – how do users determine which data to use. Met with the wave of ever greater and more complex data, users must be able to differentiate between data sets and determine which are most useful and relevant to their applications. In response to this, the NASA National Snow and Ice Data Center Distributed Active Archive Center (NSIDC DAAC) has been developing a data set search tool with researchers' needs and preferences in mind. Web metrics and usability studies have been used to answer the following questions:\n· How do users search for data?\n· Which data attributes are of primary importance when selecting a data set?\n· When similar data sets exist, how is one chosen over another?\nNSIDC DAAC has found that data set differentiation is driven by both what you present and how you present it. The “what” can range from relatively straightforward information such as the parameter measured or the spatial coverage to the more complex and nuanced such as data usage suggestions or data usage metrics. The “how” includes considerations such as making data set information scannable and comparable to tailoring relevance ranking algorithms to match user expectations. In this presentation, we will discuss the challenge of data differentiation, the strategies the NSIDC DAAC has employed with its search tool, and the opportunities available for assisting researchers in their data selection process.",

            "abstract": "The Amazon is not only an exceptionally biodiverse and carbon-rich tract of tropical forest, it is also a case study in land use change. Over the last 30 years, Amazonia has been home to extraordinary growth in agricultural production, in part from agricultural expansion, but also due to more intense management on Amazonia’s existing croplands. We use a year-long campaign and approximately 500 field chamber measurements to estimate how cropland intensification in Mato Grosso, Brazil affects the emission of nitrous oxide (N2O) and soil N dynamics. In this system, soybean cropland intensification occurs when double cropping is introduced, in which maize is planted directly after soybean harvest and fertilized twice with inorganic N. We find that dry season N2O emissions in single-cropped (soybean only) fields, double-cropped (soybean/maize) fields and reference tropical forest are uniformly near zero, or ~0-0.5 ngN/cm^2/hr. Surprisingly, wet season emissions rates remain low as well, between 1-4 ngN/cm^2/hr, for both cropland types and reference forest. By contrast, isolated post-fertilization spikes in N2O emissions are large, with a maximum increase of ~800% and a mean increase of ~400%, though these flux increases resolve rapidly and rates return to their low baseline within days. Finally, we explore the role that soil moisture, soil N availability, and soil C availability play in regulating N2O fluxes in reference forest, soybean fields and intensified soybean-maize fields. Open questions surround how the Amazon’s land resources can be leveraged to increase agricultural production at the least harm to the environment. Here, we quantify the consequences of land use change on N2O, a powerful greenhouse gas, in a critical ecosystem undergoing novel agricultural intensification. These results may inform both greenhouse gas accounting and our understanding of the effects of Amazonia’s changing agricultural landscape on the nitrogen cycle.",

            "abstract": "Cap dolostones, a globally distributed layer of carbonate rock that sits directly on terminal glacial deposits of the severe Cryogenian ice-age, contain important records of the conditions during the early stage of climatic recovery. Negative carbon isotope signals preserved in the cap are central to discussions of the mechanisms, drivers and time-scale of this interval of extreme climate change. These signals have been attributed to the rapid rise in temperature and acidic ocean conditions predicted to result from huge amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere, which bumped the Earth out of the Snowball state. Questions remain however, because detailed investigations of cap dolostone isotopic variability within individual sedimentary basins show systematic variations that are difficult to explain by temperature effects alone. Furthermore, other influences on cap isotopes have been hypothesized including, the release of massive amounts of methane trapped by the ice and upwelling of deep ocean water with negative signals.\nThis contribution will explore the potential impact of chemically enhanced diffusion (CED) on the carbon isotopic compositions of cap dolostones using a box model. CED is a process by which CO2 gas is transferred to solution via reaction with hydroxide anions. In the modern ocean, rates of CED are thought to be insignificant and CO2 gas transfer is accomplished primarily by diffusion and dissolution, with minimal isotopic fraction. However, in various highly productive lakes, the strong negative isotope fraction of -27 ‰ associated CED impacts the isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon. Post-glacial oceans may have been chemically similar to highly productive lakes and initial modeling results indicate that CED could have influenced the carbon isotopic composition of seawater and thus the cap dolostone. Implications for post-glacial oceanic conditions will be discussed.",

Statistical analysis of lithofacies stacking patterns is a common approach, and often focuses on the question of whether the observed patterns can be distinguished from those generated by random processes, which offers the potential of extrapolation into a predictive framework. The observed sedimentary record can be fragmented by a variety of issues, such as covered sections in outcrop, broken sections on cores, dolomitization, or recording errors from geophysical equipment. This missing data represents unobserved time in the record, and understanding how this missing time affects our observations can enhance our ability to reconstruct a basin’s history. Synthetic stratigraphic sections of known history are generated by Dougal, a previously developed 1-D carbonate forward numeric model, and used to explore the effects of cover, or fragmentation of the record, in the analysis of observed stratigraphic sections. Each synthetic stratigraphic section is covered in increments of 5% of the total thickness, and examined under a variety of styles ranging from a singular thick to numerous thin intervals. Covered intervals are distributed as clustered or evenly spaced across the whole stratigraphic section. Results indicate a general decrease in the degree of observed order in the stratigraphic columns as the proportion of cover increases. Within each increment, the style with a singular thick covered interval demonstrated the lowest degree of order, and the stratigraphic sections with two evenly spaced and equally thick covered intervals demonstrated the highest order. These results show how the proportional quantity and distribution of missing data can affect the identification of ordered patterns in the rock record. This work can provide guidelines for the analysis of covered intervals in stratigraphic sections.",

            "abstract": "Sedimentation Rates (SRs) for IODP Site U1424 in the Japan Basin (40o11.40’N, 138o13.90’E) were calculated by performing spectral analysis in the depth domain on both RGB color and Gamma-Ray-Attenuation (GRA) bulk density data. Inversion and integration of SRs versus depth from spectral analysis yielded detailed SR profiles in both time and depth domains. Our results show a greater variability in calculated SR’s, which differed from those established through coarse-scaled biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic data. SR profiles from our analysis exhibit similar excursions and features in both depth and age domains, with GRA representing a smoothed version of the SR profile derived from RGB data while exhibiting slight offsets in high-to-low SRs downhole versus those observed in RBG data. Both GRA and RGB profiles show a distinct periodicity in the waveband of Milankovitch cycles. The pronounced Milankovitch cyclicity suggests that climate variability and trends in SRs at Site U1424 was responding to insolation patterns during the past 4.5 Myr. A dominance of the 100 ky cycle (eccentricity) throughout the entire normalized spectral amplitude profile might be observed; however, for the purpose of fine-tuning our high-resolution Age-Depth model to fit the low-resolution Age-Depth model from biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic data, choosing obliquity (41 ky) and precession (19-23 ky) cycles as tuning-frequency produced a closer fit between high-and-low-resolution models than using the prominent eccentricity cycles (100 and 400 ky). Relatively low SRs are found when evolutive amplitude spectra are dominated by obliquity and eccentricity periods. In contrast, significant SR peaks at Site U1424 often occur when strong precessional amplitudes coexist with obliquity and eccentricity cycles. Lower SR values at Site U1424 are interpreted to reflect a decrease in diatom flux and relative increase in detrital fraction. By contrast moderate to higher SRs were associated with lower GRA density and due to a higher diatom flux.",

            "abstract": "The ability to accurately predict water availability in the cities surrounding Lake Michigan-Huron becomes particularly difficult when the uncertain effects of climate change, such as changes in precipitation patterns and evaporation rates, are considered. Lake level reconstructions provide useful model inputs to better predict this availability. Annual tree-ring widths have been successfully utilized in reconstructions of lake levels in the Great Lakes region via the creation of proxy datasets of temperature and precipitation that are then input into a multilinear regression model to reconstruct annual average lake level. Here, the combination of this approach with analysis of instrumental records of precipitation and stream flow input allows for a more comprehensive understanding of regional hydroclimate and improved projection of future water resource availability. Annual tree-ring widths of cores collected from four old-growth forests near southern Lake Michigan were combined with over 30 archived tree-ring width chronologies from the Great Lakes region and used to create proxy datasets of temperature and precipitation. A multilinear regression model related these proxy variables to Lake Michigan-Huron lake level and stream flow of the Saint Clair River, which flows into Lake Michigan-Huron, for the period of available instrumental record (1860-present). When possible, the available tree-ring widths were used to reconstruct these variables for years prior to the instrumental record. Timing and severity of rainfall events were also analyzed to identify spatial and temporal patterns and their variability over time. The combination of updated tree-ring width chronologies, chronologies from newly sampled sites, and instrumental records of various indicators of water availability provides novel and valuable insight into the future lake level of Lake Michigan-Huron.",

            "abstract": "Geoscience education and public outreach efforts (EPO), both formal and informal, are critical to increasing science literacy amongst members of the public and securing the next generation of geoscientists. At UCLA, the Institute for Planets and Exoplanets (iPLEX) has developed a multifaceted program to administer meaningful and original hands-on education and outreach to the public, teachers/professors, and students. To build the program, we first developed a virtual “home base” using Wordpress. With the needs of our community in mind, we structured the website to serve three categories of individuals: the public, teachers/professors, and volunteers. To serve the public, we have developed a series of informal education events (e.g., Exploring Your Universe) that bring thousands of science enthusiasts to campus. For those unable to participate in hands-on demonstrations or for those who would like to see them again, informational videos were developed and made available on our online Physical Demonstrations Digital Library (PDDL). The PDDL contains a second set of videos that are tutorial in nature and specifically designed with teachers, TAs and professors in mind. In addition, we have produced a publicly available annual newsletter written at the level of the informed public that details exciting and current planetary research at UCLA. Another facet of the program, designed with teachers in mind is our application-based private outreach event system in which teachers may choose to have volunteers come to their school with interactive demos or to come to UCLA to speak with scientists and tour laboratories. The final branch of the iPLEX EPO and education program caters to volunteers and includes an online “hub” where volunteers can register for events, download demonstration information packets, and discuss tips with other volunteers. We have recently developed a “Science Education, Outreach, and Communication” course to be integrated into UCLA’s undergraduate geology curriculum that will serve twofold to train new volunteers and educate young scientists on how to communicate their field to the public. Feedback from participants indicates an overall increase in geoscience EPO participation and satisfaction from the public, teachers, and volunteers alike since iPLEX’s program was emplaced.",

            "abstract": "Seasonality of productivity in tropical forests gives insight into the ecological question of resource limitation in these important high-biomass, climatically sensitive habitats. Diverse evidence from ecological studies, eddy-flux towers, and satellites had accumulated by the mid-2000s suggesting that many tropical forests are more light- than water-limited, and hence “green-up” during higher-sunlight annual dry seasons. Recent work, however, argues that the satellite-based evidence (from MODIS) of dry-season green-up in Amazon forests is an artifact of seasonal variations in sun-sensor geometry. Here we review three lines of evidence to address this new controversy about Amazon forest seasonality: first, we show that even after correcting for sun-sensor geometry artifacts, remotely sensed MODIS data significantly rejects the null hypothesis of no seasonal change in canopy greenness; second we use a re-analysis of eddy flux measurements at four towers across the equatorial Amazon to show that dry season increases in canopy-scale photosynthetic capacity are robust, independent of seasonal variations of climatic drivers. Finally, tower-mounted cameras at two of the eddy flux sites provide new independent evidence for “green-up” by showing that crown-scale leaf-flushing events are concentrated in dry seasons. This work shows that remote sensing observations remain consistent with those from ground-based towers in support of the conclusion that many Amazon forests green-up with sunlight in the dry season.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol particles are regularly transported over long distances impacting air quality, health, weather and climate thousands of kilometers downwind of the source. During transport, particle properties are modified thereby changing the associated impact on the radiation budget. Although mineral dust is of key importance for the climate system many questions such as the change of the dust size distribution during long-range transport, the role of wet and dry removal mechanisms, and the complex interaction between mineral dust and clouds remain open.\nIn June/July 2013, the Saharan Aerosol Long-range Transport and Aerosol-Cloud-Interaction Experiment (SALTRACE: http://www.pa.op.dlr.de/saltrace) was conducted to study the transport and transformation of Saharan mineral dust. Besides ground-based lidar and in-situ instruments deployed on Cape Verde, Barbados and Puerto Rico, the DLR research aircraft Falcon was equipped with an extended aerosol in-situ instrumentation, a nadir-looking 2-µm wind lidar and instruments for standard meteorological parameters.\nDuring SALTRACE, five large dust outbreaks were studied by ground-based, airborne and satellite measurements between Senegal, Cape Verde, the Caribbean, and Florida. Highlights included the Lagrangian sampling of a dust plume in the Cape Verde area on 17 June which was again measured with the same instrumentation on 21 and 22 June 2013 near Barbados. Between Cape Verde and Barbados, the aerosol optical thickness (500 nm) decreased from 0.54 to 0.26 and the stratification of the dust layers changed significantly from a rather homogenous structure near Africa to a 3-layer structure with embedded cumulus clouds in the Caribbean. In the upper part of the dust layers in the Caribbean, the aerosol properties were similar to the observations near Africa. In contrast, much more variability in the dust properties was observed between 0.7 and 2.5 km altitude probably due to interaction of the mineral dust with clouds.\nIn our presentation, we show vertical profiles of dust size distributions, CCN and dust optical properties. Based on the Lagrangian measurements, we discuss the effects of dust aging processes during long-range transport. Special attention will be given on changes in fine and coarse mode size distribution and aerosol mixing state.",

            "abstract": "It is now well accepted that atmospheric tidal waves have a dramatic influence on thermospheric and ionospheric structure and variability. Considerable effort goes into understanding the characteristics of tidal modes, their interactions with planetary and gravity waves and other tidal modes, as well as their influence on the background state of the thermosphere-ionosphere system. For the altitude interval between roughly 120 and 400 km, this effort is somewhat hindered by the lack of global observations. We propose a new method of determining tidal variability by making use of Dynasonde measurements. The NeXtYZ inversion procedure (a part of the Dynasonde software package) produces altitude profiles of the ionospheric parameters with a vertical resolution typically below 1 km. This, together with the 2 minute cadence of the instrument results in extensive datasets with wide temporal and altitude coverage. Because of the natural ionospheric variability, at any given altitude we have non-uniform sampling over extended time intervals. A Lomb-Scargle implementation is used to mitigate this issue, allowing us to obtain both amplitude and phase information in an equivalent manner at all altitudes and locations. In this poster, we provide altitude profiles of the first 3 diurnal harmonics derived from dynasonde measurements. The data analyzed include the truly vertical electron density profiles, the ionospheric X (East-West) \"tilt\" measurement and the derived zonal plasma density gradient. Both the tilt and the gradient can be shown to be sensitive tracers of atmospheric waves, in some cases more so than the raw electron density. We use data from Wallops Island, VA and San Juan, PR for May and September 2013, thus capturing seasonal, latitudinal and altitude variations of tidal amplitude and phase. This can be used for comparisons with existing theoretical work and also to test propagation of tidal waves in coupled ionosphere-thermosphere models.",

            "abstract": "With recent advances at X-ray micro-computed tomography (μCT) synchrotron beam lines, it is now possible to study pore-scale flow in porous rock under dynamic flow conditions. The collection of 4 dimensional (4D) data allows for the direct 3D visualization of fluid-fluid displacement in porous rock as a function of time. However, even state-of-the-art fast-μCT scans require between one and a few seconds to complete and the (much faster) fluid movement occurring during that time interval is manifested as imaging artifacts in the reconstructed 3D volume. We present an approach to analyze the 2D radiograph data collected during fast-μCT to study the pore-scale displacement dynamics on the time scale of 40 milliseconds which is near the intrinsic time scale of individual Haines jumps. We present a methodology to identify the time intervals at which pore scale displacement events in the observed field of view occur and hence, how reconstruction intervals can be chosen to avoid fluid-movement induced reconstruction artifacts. We further quantify the size, order, frequency, and location of fluid-fluid displacement at the millisecond time scale. We observe that after a displacement event, the pore scale fluid distribution relaxes to (quasi-) equilibrium in cascades of pore-scale fluid re-arrangements with an average relaxation time for the whole cascade between 0.5 and 2.0 seconds. These findings help to identify the flow regimes and intrinsic time and length scales relevant to fractional flow.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic areas, like Svalbard, are particularly sensitive to global climate changes as proved by modern monitoring data and the past records. One of the most spectacular changes is the rapid retreat of tidewater glaciers during the post-Little Ice Age period (after ~1900) observed in many subpolar fjords in Svalbard. The goal of this study is to assess if the observed changes affected sediment accumulation and carbon burial rates. The study reviews the existing data and new results on 210Pb and 137Cs based accumulation rates, as well as organic carbon content from Hornsund, Tempelfjorden and Kongsfjorden - the major fjords of western Spitsbergen. In the central parts of the fjords the sediment accumulation rates are generally in the order of several mm per year and in most cases significantly increased after the Little Ice Age. Consequently, also the carbon burial rates have increased. Moreover, due to the retreat, new bays often with area of several km2 each and characterised by very high sediment accumulation rates (several cm/year) have been formed in the inner parts of the fjords. They may potentially store large amounts of sediment and carbon. The available data suggest that this kind of fjords may serve as significant sediment and carbon sinks. The study was funded by Polish National Science Centre grant No. 2013/10/E/ST10/00166.",

Although meteorological stations provide accurate data observations, their spatial coverage is limited and thus often insufficient for environmental modeling. Remote sensing provides the spatial data and it fills the spatial and temporal gaps left by the meteorological stations. In this study, the surface energy balance and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products through the years 2003-2013 are used in order to estimate air temperature for New York City region and Fars Province region in south of Iran. Land surface temperature, evapotranspiration and surface reflectance data were obtained from MODIS, and by using the surface energy balance equation the air temperature is computed and analyzed. The amount of fluxes seasonally is investigated as one the most important and governing components of the energy balance.\n ",

SWOT will produce the first global survey of Earth's surface water by measuring sea surface height and the heights, slopes, and inundated areas of rivers, lakes, and wetlands. These coastal, lake and river measurements will be useful for monitoring the hydrologic cycle, flooding, and climate impacts of a changing environment.\nNASA and their French, Canadian and the United Kingdom space agency partners are developing new wide swath altimetry technology that will cover most of the world’s ocean and surface freshwater bodies, and will have the capability to make observations with unprecedented resolution compared to existing technologies and will have the capability of measuring how water bodies change over time.\nAlong with existing altimetry datasets, simulated SWOT data sets are being planned to assess the quality and potential value of anticipated SWOT measurements to both oceanography and hydrology applications. With the surface water measurements anticipated from SWOT, a broad range of applications may inform coastal managers and marine operators of offshore conditions and currents relevant to their regions. One study proposed to the NASA ASP would highlight coastal and estuary applications potential of the future SWOT mission. This study would promote the use of remote sensing measurements to improve the understanding, monitoring and management of estuaries and deltas for a broad range of users. In addition, the AirSWOT airborne mission to demonstrate the wide swath technology of SWOT is providing preliminary data products in inland and coastal regions that may be useful for early assessment by users of the future value of SWOT.\nNASA's Applied Sciences Program (ASP), along with the international SWOT project teams, is supporting a program that promotes applications research and engages a broad community of potential SWOT data users. The applied science community would be a key element in a successful SWOT mission, demonstrating the high value of NASA’s missions and the utility of science and data products in addressing societal issues and needs.",

            "abstract": "An intensive summer 2013 aerosol field campaign was conducted at the Appalachian Atmospheric Interdisciplinary Research facility at Appalachian State University (AppalAIR), coinciding with the SOAS campaign in the SE U.S. Measurements included lower tropospheric and column-averaged aerosol properties as part of the NOAA-ESRL and NASA AERONET, lidar-derived vertical profiles of aerosols and clouds, surface and vertical meteorology, and aerosol and organic precursor chemical composition. Clustered 120-hour HYSPLIT back-trajectories were used to determine the influence of source region on aerosol properties and composition. A synoptic-scale weather classification scheme (Sheridan 2000) was applied to bin the aerosol properties by synoptic weather type. Co-located near-surface T, P, and RH measurements and vertical profiles from 75 radiosonde launches were used to determine the influence of local meteorology on the aerosol properties. The anomalously cool, wet summer dampened and delayed the summer peak in aerosol scattering and absorption, relative to previous summers and limited the number of sunphotometer retrievals of column-averaged aerosol properties. Nevertheless, aerosol loading, composition, and several key optical properties such as absorption Angstrom exponent displayed distinct dependence on source region and meteorology. As an example, both light scattering and isoprene-derived SOA concentrations (Link et al, 2014) were highest for more pollution-influenced NE air masses, for which lower hemispheric backscatter fractions and absorption Angstrom exponents were observed. Aerosol loading was generally lower for SW and SE air masses, with the exception of extra-moist tropical weather types, which coincided with high aerosol optical depth and larger, hygroscopic, primarily scattering particles. Aerosol loading increased with local temperature and pressure and some other properties also displayed temperature dependence but the range of temperatures observed during summer 2013 was much less than previous summers, making it difficult to draw significant conclusions based solely on the summer 2013 data. Aerosol optical properties from summer 2013 will also be placed in a longer-term context by comparisons with those from previous summers.",

            "abstract": "Rupture process of earthquake derived from geophysical observations is important information to understand nature of earthquake and assess seismic hazard. Finite fault inversion is a commonly applied method to construct seismic source model. In conventional inversion, fault is approximated by a simple fault surface even if rupture of real earthquake should propagate along non-planar complex fault. In the conventional inversion, complex rupture kinematics is approximated by limited model parameters that only represent slip on a simple fault surface. This over simplification may cause biased and hence misleading solution. MW 7.7 left-lateral strike-slip earthquake occurred in southwestern Pakistan on 2013-09-24 might be one of exemplar event to demonstrate the bias. For this earthquake, northeastward rupture propagation was suggested by a finite fault inversion of teleseismic body and long period surface waves with a single planer fault (USGS). However, surface displacement field measured from cross-correlation of optical satellite images and back-projection imaging revealed that rupture was unilaterally propagated toward southwest on a non-planer fault (Avouac et.al., 2014). To mitigate the bias, more flexible source parameterization should be employed. We extended multi-time window finite fault method to represent rupture kinematics on a complex fault. Each spatio-temporal knot has five degrees of freedom and is able to represent arbitrary strike, dip, rake, moment release rate and CLVD component. Detailed fault geometry for a source fault is not required in our method. The method considers data covariance matrix with uncertainty of Green’s function (Yagi and Fukahata, 2011) to obtain stable solution. Preliminary results show southwestward rupture propagation and focal mechanism change that is consistent with fault trace. The result suggests usefulness of the flexible source parameterization for inversion of complex events.",

            "abstract": "Planning and decision processes in the Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program (GCDAMP) strive to balance numerous, often competing, objectives, such as, water supply, hydropower generation, low flow maintenance, sandbars, recreational trout angling, endangered native fish, whitewater rafting, and other sociocultural resources of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and Grand Canyon National Park. In this context, use of monitored and predictive information on warm-season Paria River floods (JUL-OCT, at point-to-regional scales) has been identified as lead information for a new 10-year long controlled flooding experiment (termed the High-Flow Experiment Protocol) intended to determine management options for rebuilding and maintaining sandbars below Glen Canyon Dam; an adaptive strategy that can potentially facilitate improved planning and dam operations. In this work, we focus on a key concern identified by the GCDAMP, related to the timing and volume of warm season tributary sand input from the Paria River into the Colorado River in Grand Canyon National Park. The Little Colorado River is an important secondary source of sand inputs to Grand Canyon, but its lower segment is also critical spawning habitat for the endangered humpback chub. Fish biologists have reported increased abundance of chub juveniles in this key tributary in summers following cool-season flooding (DEC-FEB), but little is known about chub spawning substrates and behavior or the role that flood frequency in this tributary may play in native fish population dynamics in Grand Canyon. Episodic and intraseasonal variations (with links to equatorial and sub-tropical Pacific sea surface temperature variability) in southwest hydroclimatology are investigated to understand the magnitude, timing and spatial scales of warm- and cool-season floods from these two important tributaries of the semi-arid Colorado Plateau. Coupled variations of floods (magnitude and timing) from these rivers are also investigated. The physical processes, including diagnosis of storms and moisture sources, are mapped alongside the planning and decision processes for the ongoing experimental flood releases from the dam which are aimed at improving sandbars and instream ecology of native fish.",

            "abstract": "Vegetation cover was introduced into general circulations models (GCMs) in the 1980’s to account for the effect of land surface albedo and water vapor conductance on the Earth’s climate. Schemes assigning canopy albedoes by broad biome type have been superceded in 1990’s by canopy radiative transfer schemes for homogeneous canopies obeying Beer’s Law extinction as a function of leaf area index (LAI). Leaf albedo and often canopy height are prescribed by plant functional type (PFT). It is recognized that this approach does not effectively describe geographic variation in the radiative transfer of vegetated cover, particularly for mixed and sparse canopies. GCM-coupled dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) have retained these simple canopy representations, with little further evaluation of their albedos. With the emergence lidar-derived canopy vertical structure data, DGVM modelers are now revisiting albedo simulation.\nWe present preliminary prognostic global land surface albedo produced by the Ent Terrestrial Biosphere Model (TBM), a DGVM coupled to the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) GCM. The Ent TBM is a next generation DGVM designed to incorporate variation in canopy heights, and mixed and sparse canopies. For such dynamically varying canopy structure, it uses the Analytical Clumped Two-Stream (ACTS) canopy radiative transfer model, which is derived from gap probability theory for canopies of tree cohorts with ellipsoidal crowns, and accounts for soil, snow, and bare stems. We have developed a first-order global vegetation structure data set (GVSD), which gives a year of satellite-derived geographic variation in canopy height, maximum canopy leaf area, and seasonal LAI. Combined with Ent allometric relations, this data set provides population density and foliage clumping within crowns. We compare the Ent prognostic albedoes to those of the previous GISS GCM scheme, and to satellite estimates. The impact of albedo differences on surface climatology is analyzed. Future versions of the Ent GVSD will specify vertical stratification of canopy communities. This work sets the foundation for accounting for canopy clumping in vegetation community competition for light, and the ability of GCM-coupled DGVMs to incorporate lidar data sets of canopy structure.",

We are developing a lightning fast Big Data technology called SciSpark based on ApacheTM Spark. Spark implements the map-reduce paradigm for parallel computing on a cluster, but emphasizes in-memory computation, “spilling” to disk only as needed, and so outperforms the disk-based ApacheTM Hadoop by 100x in memory and by 10x on disk, and makes iterative algorithms feasible.\nSciSpark will enable scalable model evaluation by executing large-scale comparisons of A-Train satellite observations to model grids on a cluster of 100 to 1000 compute nodes. This 2nd generation capability for NASA’s Regional Climate Model Evaluation System (RCMES) will compute simple climate metrics at interactive speeds, and extend to quite sophisticated iterative algorithms such as machine-learning (ML) based clustering of temperature PDFs, and even graph-based algorithms for searching for Mesocale Convective Complexes.\nThe goals of SciSpark are to: (1) Decrease the time to compute comparison statistics and plots from minutes to seconds; (2) Allow for interactive exploration of time-series properties over seasons and years; (3) Decrease the time for satellite data ingestion into RCMES to hours; (4) Allow for Level-2 comparisons with higher-order statistics or PDF’s in minutes to hours; and (5) Move RCMES into a near real time decision-making platform.\nWe will report on: the architecture and design of SciSpark, our efforts to integrate climate science algorithms in Python and Scala, parallel ingest and partitioning (sharding) of A-Train satellite observations from HDF files and model grids from netCDF files, first parallel runs to compute comparison statistics and PDF’s, and first metrics quantifying parallel speedups and memory & disk usage.",

            "abstract": "Active learning has gained increasing support as an effective pedagogical technique to improve student learning. One way to promote active learning in the classroom is the use of in-class activities in place of lecturing. As part of an NSF-funded project, a set of in-class activities have been created that use climate change topics to teach chemistry content. These activities use the Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) methodology. In this pedagogical approach a set of models and a series of critical thinking questions are used to guide students through the introduction to or application of course content. Students complete the activities in their groups, with the faculty member as a facilitator of learning. Through assigned group roles and intentionally designed activity structure, process skills, such as teamwork, communication, and information processing, are developed during completion of the activity.\nEach of these climate change activities contains a socio-scientific component, e.g., social, ethical and economic data. In one activity, greenhouse gases are used to explain the concept of dipole moment. Data about natural and anthropogenic production rates, global warming potential and atmospheric lifetimes for a list of greenhouse gases are presented. The students are asked to identify which greenhouse gas they would regulate, with a corresponding explanation for their choice. They are also asked to identify the disadvantages of regulating the gas they chose in the previous question. In another activity, where carbon sequestration is used to demonstrate the utility of a phase diagram, students use economic and environmental data to choose the best location for sequestration.\nToo often discussions about climate change (both in and outside the classroom) consist of purely emotional responses. These activities force students to use data to support their arguments and hypothesize about what other data could be used in the corresponding discussion to support their position. In this presentation, we will present examples of the socio-scientific components of several activities, and discuss the challenges associated with incorporating socio-scientific components into content-based class activities.",

            "abstract": "The low-lying, coastal region of Bangladesh has relied on poldering (the creation of embanked islands) since the 1960s to mitigate the effects of tidal inundation and storm surge from tropical cyclones. The result has been an increase in total arable land and the ability to sustain food production for one of the most densely populated countries in the world. However, poldering has had the unintended consequences of starving embanked landscapes of sediment and increasing high water levels through tidal amplification. Thus, polder elevations have been declining while tidal channels have been aggrading. Recent small-scale engineering projects, locally referred to as tidal river management (TRM), have attempted to combat these effects by allowing water and sediment exchange between the polders and the tidal network. Anecdotal reports claim great success for TRM in some locations, but not in others. However, to date there has been almost no quantitative analysis.\nHere, we used measured sedimentation rates and water level data from Polder 32 (P32) and the adjacent pristine mangrove forest in southwest Bangladesh to parameterize a simple model of tidal inundation and resultant sediment accretion. P32 elevations are currently ~1 m lower than natural elevations resulting in ~105 cm of tidal inundation when embankments were breached versus only ~20 cm for the mangrove forest. We measured sedimentation rates of 20 cm/yr and 1 cm/yr, respectively. When normalized to the cumulative annual flooding depth, the resulting sediment extraction rates yield similar values of 300 mg/L and 230 mg/L. We employ these flooding depth and sediment extraction parameters in our model to quantify the amount of time and sediment needed to re-equilibrate the lowered polder elevation to that of the natural environment.\nAlthough relatively simple, results from this preliminary model corroborate anecdotes of TRM’s effectiveness at restoring land-surface elevations in the polders of Bangladesh. Future work will add spatial variation and possibly integrate human actions with agent-based models.",

            "abstract": "This study focusses on improving methods of accounting for atmospheric effects on infrasound amplitudes observed on arrays at regional distances in the southwestern United States. Recordings at ranges of 150 to nearly 300 km from a repeating ground truth source of small HE explosions are used. The explosions range in actual weight from approximately 2000-4000 lbs. and are detonated year-round which provides signals for a wide range of atmospheric conditions. Three methods of correcting the observed amplitudes for atmospheric effects are investigated with the data set. The first corrects amplitudes for upper stratospheric wind as developed by Mutschlecner and Whitaker (1999) and uses the average wind speed between 45–55 km altitudes in the direction of propagation to derive an empirical correction formula. This approach was developed using large chemical and nuclear explosions and is tested with the smaller explosions for which shorter wavelengths cause the energy to be scattered by the smaller scale structure of the atmosphere. The second approach isa semi-empirical method using ray tracing to determine wind speed at ray turning heights where the wind estimates replace the wind values in the existing formula. Finally, parabolic equation (PE) modeling is used to predict the amplitudes at the arrays at 1 Hz. The PE amplitudes are compared to the observed amplitudes with a narrow band filter centered at 1 Hz. An analysis is performed of the conditions under which the empirical and semi-empirical methods fail and full wave methods must be used.",

            "abstract": "We isolated an efficient weathering strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens from the rhizosphere of a White Pine (Pinus strobus) seedling. We grew it in a drip-flow biofilm reactor using both Fe-abundant and Fe-deficient media on either a glass or biotite coupon. Our working hypothesis was that the bacterium would respond to Fe deficiency by enhancing biotite weathering through an increase in the relative amount of polysaccharides in the biofilm compared to the Fe-abundant treatment. Because Fe is necessary for biofilm development, we hypothesized that biomass production on the biotite surface would exceed that on a Fe-free glass slide only in the Fe-deficient medium. We quantified total biomass, specific number of viable cells (SNVC), and the concentrations of K, Mg, and Fe in the biofilm. High-resolution magic angle spinning proton nuclear magnetic resonance (HR-MAS 1H-NMR) spectroscopy was used to characterize the biofilm matrix in terms of relative biofilm constituent concentrations. Compared with biofilms grown on glass, biofilms grown on biotite had higher total biomass and SNVC irrespective of Fe supply, with a near doubling of both the biofilm biomass from 0.43 to 0.76 mg cm-2 and SNVC from 1.52 × 107 to 3.24 × 107 CFU cm-2 mg-1 when Fe was deficient, and an increase in biomass from 1.94 to 2.46 mg cm-2 and in SNVC from 8.39 × 107 to 1.96 × 108 CFU cm-2 mg-1 when Fe was sufficient. Similarly with Fe deficient, the cation concentrations in biofilms grown on biotite vs. glass increased 2.14 and 2.46 times for K and Mg, respectively, and 7.01 times for Fe. When Fe was sufficient, the concentrations of cations increased 1.24, 2.07, and 3.77 times for K, Mg, and Fe, respectively. Based on NMR spectra, no significant change in biofilm chemistry occurred between the glass and biotite systems whether Fe was deficient or not. However, we did observe an increase in the ratio of the integrated areas corresponding to the carbohydrate and protein NMR regions, increasing from 0.52 for biofilms grown on biotite with Fe, to 0.74 for biofilms grown on biotite without Fe. The response to Fe deficiency suggests that the biofilm adapted to nutrient stress rather than the surface it attached to and that the primary response was increased polysaccharide production.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the link between the chemical and structural properties of pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM) and its subsequent reactivity in soil is critical to predict how future increases in forest fire frequency and intensity will affect C and N cycling. Herein, we present results from a laboratory incubation that investigated the effects of wood species and charring temperature on the decomposition of PyOM and native soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics in a sandy soil from a northern temperate forest (University of Michigan Biological Station, Pellston, MI, USA). PyOM was produced from highly 13C/15N-labeled red maple (RM; Acer rubrum) and jack pine (JP; Pinus banksania) at 0 (native wood), 200, 300, 450 and 600 °C. PyOM amendments to soil were at 11 % total soil C. After 3 months of this ongoing incubation, 13CO2 evolution indicates that both pyrolysis temperature and species played a significant role in PyOM and native SOC mineralization. For both species, PyOM-C mineralization decreased with increasing temperature and PyOM ≥200 °C additions decreased SOC mineralization relative to controls.. In addition, PyOM-C mineralization of RM-derived PyOM was enhanced relative to JP-derived PyOM at temperatures <600 °C. Soils with added RM-derived PyOM exhibited significantly lower SOC mineralization at 300 and 450 °C than from JP-derived PyOM additions. These results highlighting interactive temperature and species effects are consistent with our detailed spectroscopic, elemental and isotope analysis of the PyOM samples across this pyrolysis gradient, which shows significant physicochemical changes at 300 °C for JP and between 300 and 450 °C for RM. Efforts will be made in this paper to link PyOM structural and chemical properties to the PyOM and native SOC turnover rates.",

            "abstract": "SLAP (Scanning L-band Active Passive) comprises of a fully polarimetric L-band radiometer and fully polarimetric L-band radar with a shared antenna. SLAP is designed to be compatible with several aircrafts; specifically, C-23, Twin Otter, P-3, and C-130. SLAP is designed for simplicity, accuracy, & reliability. It leverages, as much as possible, existing instruments, hardware, and software in order to minimize cost, time, and risk.The SLAP airborne/ground campaign is designed to conduct flight testing and ground truth for the airborne instrument. The campaign took place the third week of December 2013 in Eastern Shore, MD. SLAP contributes to the NASA’s core mission because of its ability to serve as an airborne simulator for the SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) satellite mission, one of NASA’s flagship missions scheduled to launch in January 2015. A 3-day aircraft validation campaign was conducted where the new SLAP instrument flew three separate days over the proposed sampling region. The study area is a mixed agriculture and forest site located about 1 hour east of Washington, DC on the Eastern Shore (of the Chesapeake Bay). This region is located on the Delmarva Peninsula. The advantages of the selected site are: (1) Site was used before in previous field campaign (SMAPVEX08) (2) ARS HRSL has some established sampling sites within region (3) Dynamic variation in land cover (4) Variety of plant structures and densities. The goal of this campaign was to fly the instrument over the proposed site before a rain event, then have 2 other flights after the rain event to capture a dry down. In conjunction with the aircraft, there was in-situ ground sampling. Ground observations were collected concurrent with aircraft flights. These included soil moisture, soil temperature, surface temperature, surface roughness and vegetation parameters. Forest sites were monitored with small temporary networks of in situ sensors installed prior to the first flight. Soil moisture was characterized for all fields within an area large enough to include several aircraft footprints. The field conditions during the campaign were favorable to demonstrate the accuracy of the instrument. A variation in soil moisture was observed within the data set which is ideal for instrument validation.",

            "abstract": "Interactions among wood debris, fluid flow and sediment transport in rivers are first-order controls on channel morphodynamics, affecting streambed morphology, sediment transport, sediment storage and aquatic habitat. Woody debris increases the hydraulic and topographic complexity in rivers, leading to a greater diversity of aquatic habitats and an increase in the number of large pools that are important fish habitat and breeding grounds. In the past decade, engineered logjams have become an increasingly used tool in river management for simultaneously decreasing the rate of riverbank migration and improving aquatic habitat. Sediment deposits around woody debris build up riverbanks and counteract bank migration caused by erosion. Previous experiments on flow visualization around model woody debris suggest the amount of sediment scour and deposition are primarily related to the presence of roots and the obstructional area of the woody debris. We present the results of fieldwork and sediment transport experiments of streambed morphology around stationary woody debris. Field surveys on the Hoh River and the Elwha River, WA, measure the local streambed morphology around logjams and individual pieces of woody debris. We quantified the amount of local scour and dam-removal related fine sediment deposition around natural and engineered logjams of varying sizes and construction styles, located in different geomorphic settings. We also quantified the amount of local scour around individual pieces of woody debris of varying sizes, geometries and orientations relative to flow. The flume experiments tested the effects of root geometry and log orientation of individual stationary trees on streambed morphology. The flume contained a deformable sediment bed of medium sand. We find that: 1) the presence of roots on woody debris leads to greater areas of both sediment scour and deposition; and 2) the amount of sediment scour and deposition are related to the wood debris cross-sectional area, oriented orthogonal to flow. A better understanding of the underlying sediment physics and hydraulics around naturally occurring woody debris in rivers can provide guidance and criteria for use in river restoration and engineering as well as scientific insights into a complex interdisciplinary problem.",

It was flown on two recent SDO/EVE sounding rocket calibration underflights, is the primary science instrument on the upcoming Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer (MinXSS) NASA CubeSat, and is part of the proposed instrument payload for the CubeSat Imaging X-ray Solar Spectrometer (CubIXSS) mission concept. With the best resolution yet obtained from a broadband X-ray spectrometer, the X123 will enable new studies of plasma heating and particle acceleration, during flares and quiescent periods, and help to fill a crucial observational gap from ~0.2 to ~1.2 keV, not currently measured by existing instruments but critical for understanding solar-driven dynamics in Earth's upper atmosphere (ionosphere, thermosphere, mesosphere).\nWe present results from a new analysis of X123 data obtained from the SDO/EVE rocket flights. In preparation for future MinXSS and CubIXSS data, we adapt a recently-developed technique combining EUV and X-ray spectra from SDO/EVE and RHESSI, respectively, to obtain a self-consistent differential emission measure (DEM) over the full range of coronal temperatures, ~2-50 MK. Including the X123 rocket X-ray spectra, we apply the adapted technique to examine both the coronal DEM and composition during quiescent (non-flaring) times with varying activity levels, obtaining constraints on the high-temperature extent of the quiescent DEM, the elemental abundances, and any potential non-thermal emission, and use the observations to extrapolate the spectrum to the poorly-observed ~0.2-1.2 keV band. We compare these results with those from a parallel technique using SDO/AIA imaging data. We discuss the implications for coronal plasma heating and the expectations for future observations from MinXSS and CubIXSS.",

The GF between two receivers is typically obtained based on the cross-correlation of noise recorded in two stations. Nevertheless, in this research we use large-scale earthquake numerical simulations to construct appropriate signals and optimal linear combinations of the displacements at two stations due to a small number of double-couple sources in a layered media to retrieve the Green´s function between receivers. The impulse response is obtained successfully by applying the cross-correlation, following standard interferometry theory. Additionally, the azimuthal dependence on the cross-correlations as an estimate of the impulse response is discussed using specific source locations. The main objective of our research is to elucidate the applicability of seismic interferometry in order to extend the frequency range and quality of tomographic studies based on observed regional earthquake records and dispersion maps. Thus, we show the results of the GF obtained using the aforementioned procedure in a realistic three-dimensional model of central Mexico, and quantify the discrepancies against the exact numerically computed GF. We conclude that a fair recovery is achieved by inverting velocity profiles at selected stations.",

            "abstract": "Over the last century, land use changes in the Ganges-Brahmaputra tidal delta have transformed >5000 km2 of intertidal mangrove forest to densely inhabited, agricultural islands that have been embanked to protect against tides and storm surges (i.e., polders). More recently, the conversion of rice paddies to profitable shrimp aquaculture has become increasingly widespread. Recent field studies documented that poldering in southwest Bangladesh has resulted in an elevation deficit relative to that of the natural mangrove forests and mean high water (MHW). The offset is a function of lost sedimentation, enhanced compaction, and an effective rise in MHW from tidal amplification. The morphologic adjustment of the tidal channel network to these perturbations, however, has gone largely undocumented. One effect has been the shoaling of many channels due to decreases in fluvial discharge and tidal prism. We document a previously unrecognized anthropogenic component: the widespread closure of large conduit tidal channels for land reclamation and shrimp farming.\nGIS analysis of historical Landsat and Google Earth imagery within six 1000 km2 study areas reveals that the tidal network in the natural Sundarbans mangrove forest has remained relatively constant since the 1970s, while significant changes are observed in human-modified areas. Construction of the original embankments removed >1000 km of primary tidal creeks, and >80 km2 of land has been reclaimed outside of polders through the closure of formerly active tidal channels (decrease in mean channel width from 256±91 m to 25±10 m). Tidal restriction by large sluice gates is prevalent, favoring local channel siltation. Furthermore, severing the intertidal platform and large conduit channels from the tidal network has had serious repercussions, such as increased lateral migration and straightening of the remaining channels. Where banklines have eroded, the adjacent embankments appear to be more vulnerable to failure, as observed from the effects of Cyclone Aila in 2009: multiple embankments failed at sites of recent channel migration and impounded primary creeks.\nAlthough global climate change and sea-level rise is a major concern for this low-lying delta, this study highlights the need to understand the repercussions of anthropogenic modification as well.",

            "abstract": "Research undertaken by the New England Sustainability Consortium includes use of multi-scale elevation data ranging from one arc-second (~30m) NED to two-meter LiDAR for delineation and subsequent characterization of watersheds draining to the Gulf of Maine. Watersheds within the study area range from the Penobscot River (drainage area > 22,000 km2) to small coastal streams with drainage basins <1km2. The research seeks to relate fresh water flows to water quality conditions within bathing beaches and shellfish harvesting areas along the Maine coast.\nAlthough spatial analysts typically pursue topographic data with the highest available resolution, use of multi-scale elevation data is necessary in regions where datasets are created from different survey methods. The sizes of the watersheds draining to the Gulf of Maine vary substantially, with several large interior-reaching watersheds dwarfing most of the coastal basins. An elevation raster at a two meter grid size can produce large file sizes and long processing times, presenting cost-benefit considerations due to the relatively low level of detail necessary for comparison of the largest watersheds to the rest of the study basins. Our watershed delineation method involves a multi-step approach to capture the inland portions of large watersheds using 10m and 30m USGS DEMs, while maintaining use of two-meter coastal LiDAR to accurately delineate the small coastal basins.\nOur delineated watersheds are parameterized based on multiple geomorphological and land use characteristics to facilitate evaluation of the relation between watershed and coastal water quality conditions at monitoring stations along the Maine coast. Landscape characteristics under consideration include watershed size (drainage area), surface drainage network density, soil drainage, vegetation cover, and impervious surface area.",

            "abstract": "Sea level rise is one the more important risks due to climate change. Multiple satellite altimeters flying on the same repeating ground track have allowed estimation of global and regional sea level for the past 20 years, and the time series has yielded information about how sea level is responding to climate change. Due to the duration, consistency, and inter-calibration of the altimeter measurements, the time series is now considered a climate data record. The time series has also shown the strong dependence of sea level on interannual signals such as the ENSO and PDO. Global mean sea level change as estimated by the altimeters is arguably one of the most sensitive indicators of climate change because it varies almost entirely due to thermal expansion/contraction and the exchange of water between the land and oceans. Contributions to the latter include melting land ice and changes in the hydrologic cycle. While thermal expansion does not vary greatly on interannual time-scales, variations in the global hydrologic cycle and land ice melt can contribute to large variations in the sea level record. Isolating and understanding the causes and scales of these variations is important in interpreting the observed global and regional sea level change, especially for decision-makers assessing risk and planning for adaptation and/or mitigation.\nSince 1992, satellite altimeter measurements from the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason missions, have been providing precise estimates of sea level change between ±66° latitude every 10 days. We have been using these measurements to monitor both global average and regional sea level change. The GRACE mission has provided monthly estimates of the time-varying gravity field for the last 10 years. These measurements can estimate variations in global ocean mass, mass changes in the polar ice sheets and mountain glaciers, as well as changes in the land surface water storage. These data sets can be used to inform us about the sea level change over most of the Earth and the causes/sources of this change. With this information, we can gauge how the Earth is responding to climate change, map the regional changes in sea level, and improve our projections of future sea level change and its impacts.\nWe will discuss both the benefits and challenges of using satellite-measured sea level change as a climate indicator.",

            "abstract": "Recent work shows that after a high severity forest fire, approximately 60% more solar radiation reaches the snow surface due to the reduction in canopy density. Also, significant amounts of black carbon (BC) particles and larger burned woody debris (BWD) are shed from standing charred trees, which concentrate on the snowpack, darken its surface, and reduce snow albedo by 50% during ablation. The postfire forest environment drives a substantial increase in net shortwave radiation at the snowpack surface, driving earlier and more rapid melt, however hydrologic models do not explicitly incorporate forest fire disturbance effects to snowpack dynamics. In this study we characterized, parameterized, and validated the postfire snow albedo effect: how the deposition and concentration of charred forest debris decreases snow albedo, increases snow albedo decay rates, and drives an earlier date of snow disappearance. For three study sites in the Oregon High Cascade Mountains, a 2-yr old burned forest, a 10-yr burned forest, and a nearby unburned forest, we used a suite of empirical data to characterize the magnitude and duration of the postfire effect to snow albedo decay. For WY 2012, WY2013, and WY2014 we conducted spectral albedo measurements, snow surface sampling, in-situ snow and meteorological monitoring, and snow energy balance modeling. From these data we developed a new parameterization which represents the postfire effect to snow albedo decay as a function of days-since-snowfall. We validated our parameterization using a physically-based, spatially-distributed snow accumulation and melt model, in-situ snow monitoring, net snowpack radiation, and remote sensing data. We modeled snow dynamics across the extent of all burned area in the headwaters of the McKenzie River Basin and validated the watershed-scale implications of the postfire snow albedo effect using in-situ micrometeorological and remote sensing data. This research quantified the watershed scale postfire effects to snow albedo and snow melt in the Oregon High Cascades, and provided a new parameterization of forest fire effects to high elevation winter water storage.",

            "abstract": "The recent PCAST report (2012), Engage to Excel, calls for a major shift in instructional modes in introductory (geo)science courses by “replacing standard laboratory courses with discovery-based research courses”. An increased emphasis is recommended to engage students in experiments with the possibility of true discovery and expanded use of scientific research courses in the first two years. To address this challenge, the On the Cutting Edge program convened a workshop of geoscience faculty to explore the many ways that true research experiences can be built into introductory geoscience courses. The workshop goals included: consideration of the opportunities, strategies and methods used to provide research experiences for students in lower division geoscience courses; examination of ways to develop students’ “geoscience habits of mind” through participation in authentic research activities; exploration of ways that student research projects can be designed to contribute to public science literacy with applications to a range of issues facing humanity; and development of strategies to obtain funding for these research projects, to make these programs sustainable in departments and institutions, and to scale-up these programs so that all students may participate. Access to Earth data, information technology, lab and field-based instrumentation, and field experiences provide unprecedented opportunities for students to engage in authentic research at early stages in their careers. Early exposure to research experiences has proven to be effective in the recruitment of students to the geoscience disciplines, improved retention and persistence in degree programs, motivation for students to learn and increase self-efficacy, improved attitudes and values about science, and overall increased student success.

            "abstract": "The Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) provides instruments for creating and operating seismic arrays at a wide range of scales. As an example, for over thirty years the IRIS PASSCAL program has provided instruments to individual Principal Investigators to deploy arrays of all shapes and sizes on every continent. These arrays have ranged from just a few sensors to hundreds or even thousands of sensors, covering areas with dimensions of meters to thousands of kilometers. IRIS also operates arrays directly, such as the USArray Transportable Array (TA) as part of the EarthScope program. Since 2004, the TA has rolled across North America, at any given time spanning a swath of approximately 800 km by 2,500 km, and thus far sampling 2% of the Earth’s surface. This achievement includes all of the lower-48 U.S., southernmost Canada, and now parts of Alaska. IRIS has also facilitated specialized arrays in polar environments and on the seafloor. In all cases, the data from these arrays are freely available to the scientific community. As the community of scientists who use IRIS facilities and data look to the future they have identified a clear need for new array capabilities. In particular, as part of its Wavefields Initiative, IRIS is exploring new technologies that can enable large, dense array deployments to record unaliased wavefields at a wide range of frequencies. Large-scale arrays might utilize multiple sensor technologies to best achieve observing objectives and optimize equipment and logistical costs. Improvements in packaging and power systems can provide equipment with reduced size, weight, and power that will reduce logistical constraints for large experiments, and can make a critical difference for deployments in harsh environments or other situations where rapid deployment is required. We will review the range of existing IRIS array capabilities with an overview of previous and current deployments and examples of data and results. We will review existing IRIS projects that explore new array capabilities and highlight future directions for IRIS instrumentation facilities.",

            "abstract": "We conduct a probabilistic seismic hazard and risk analysis from induced and tectonic earthquakes for a 50 km radius area centered on The Geysers, California and for the next ten years. We calculate hazard with both a conventional and physics-based approach. We estimate site specific hazard. We convert hazard to risk of nuisance and damage to structures per year and map the risk. For the conventional PSHA we assume the past ten years is indicative of hazard for the next ten years from M<4.5 earthquakes. Larger earthquakes are added from evaluation of b-values. For the physics-based appraoch, we utilize computations (Heidbach and Altmann, 2013) to calculate pressure as a function of position throughout The Geysers for the next 10 years. We then use another geo-mechanical modeling code (Bachmann et al., 2012) to calculate the number of earthquakes that will occur. We identify amplification factors for specific sites within each geologic unit from recordings of noise. Then, we interpolate within each geologic unit in finely gridded points. All grid points within a unit are weighted by distance from each data collection point. The entire process is repeated for all of the other types of geologic units until the entire area is gridded and assigned a hazard value for every grid points.\nWe found that nuisance and damage risks calculated by both conventional and physics-based approaches provided almost identical results. This is very surprising since they were calculated by completely independent means. The conventional approach used the actual catalog of the past ten years of earthquakes to estimate the hazard for the next ten year. While the physics-based approach used geotechnical modeling to calculate the catalog for the next ten years. Similarly, for the conventional PSHA, we utilized attenuation relations from past earthquakes recorded at the Geysers to translate the ground motion from the source to the site. While for the physics-based approach we calculated ground motion from simulation of actual earthquake rupture. Finally, the source of the earthquakes was the actual source for the conventional PSHA. While, we assumed random fractures for the physics-based approach. From all this, we consider the calculation of the conventional approach, based on actual data, to validate the physics-based approach used.",

            "abstract": "The IMPROVE (Interagency Monitoring of PROtected Visual Environments) network monitors aerosol concentrations at 170 remote sites throughout the United States. Twenty-four-hour filter samples of particulate matter are collected every third day and analyzed for chemical composition. About 30 of the sites have operated continuously since 1988, and the sustained data record (http://views.cira.colostate.edu/web/) offers a unique window on regional aerosol trends.\nAll elemental analyses have been performed by Crocker Nuclear Laboratory at the University of California in Davis, and sample filters collected since 1995 are archived on campus. The suite of reported elements has remained constant, but the analytical methods employed for their determination have evolved. For example, the elements Na – Mn were determined by PIXE until November 2001, then by XRF analysis in a He-flushed atmosphere through 2004, and by XRF analysis in vacuum since January 2005. In addition to these fundamental changes, incompletely-documented operational factors such as detector performance and calibration details have introduced variations in the measurements.\nBecause the past analytical methods were non-destructive, the archived filters can be re-analyzed with the current analytical systems and protocols. The 15-year sample archives from Great Smoky Mountains (GRSM), Mount Rainier (MORA), and Point Reyes National Parks (PORE) were selected for reanalysis. The agreement between the new analyses and original determinations varies with element and analytical era. The graph below compares the trend estimates for all the elements measured by IMPROVE based on the original and repeat analyses; the elements identified in color are measured above the detection limit more than 90% of the time. The trend estimates are sensitive to the treatment of non-detect data. The original and reanalysis trends are indistinguishable (have overlapping confidence intervals) for most of the well-detected elements.",

The Canadian sites were selected so as to encompass a representative variety of different aerosol types ranging from fine mode (submicron) pollution and smoke aerosols, coarse mode (supermicron) dust, fine and coarse mode marine aerosols, volcanic (fine mode) sulfates and volcanic (coarse mode) ash, etc). A particular focus was placed on comparisons at remote Canadian sites with a further focus on Arctic sites. The analysis included meteorological-scale event comparisons as well as seasonal and yearly comparisons on a climatological scale. The investigations were given a further aerosol type context by comparing optical retrievals of fine and coarse mode AOD with the AODs of the different aerosol types predicted by GEOS-Chem. The effects of temporal and spectral cloud screening of the sunphotometer data on the quality and robustness of these comparisons was the object of an important supporting investigation. The results of this study will be presented for a 3 year period from 2009 to 2011.",

            "abstract": "We present results from experiments and simulations of magnetic reconnection between colliding plumes of laser-produced plasma. In the experiments, which open up a new experimental regime for reconnection study, bubbles of high-temperature, high-density plasma are created by focusing lasers down to sub-millimeter-scale spots on a plastic or metal foil, ionizing the foil into hemispherical bubbles that expand supersonically off the surface of the foil. If multiple bubbles are created at small separation, the bubbles expand into one another, and the embedded magnetic fields (either self-generated or externally imposed) are squeezed together and reconnect. We will review recent experiments, which have observed magnetic field annihilation, outflow jets, particle energization, and the formation of elongated current sheets. We compare the results against experiments with unmagnetized plumes, which observe the Weibel instability as the two plumes collide and interact. Particle-in-cell simulations of the strongly driven reconnection in these experiments show fast reconnection due to two-fluid effects, flux pile-up, and plasmoid formation, and show particle energization by reconnection.",

            "abstract": "For the last century, the island of Maui, Hawaii, has been the center of environmental, agricultural, and legal conflict with respect to surface and groundwater allocation. Planning for adequate future freshwater resources requires flexible and adaptive policies that emphasize partnerships and knowledge transfer between scientists and non-scientists. In 2012 the Hawai‘i state legislature passed the Climate Change Adaptation Priority Guidelines (Act 286) law requiring county and state policy makers to include island-wide climate change scenarios in their planning processes. This research details the ongoing work by researchers in the NOAA funded Pacific RISA to support the development of Hawaii’s first island-wide water use plan under the new climate adaptation directive.\nThis integrated project combines several models with participatory future scenario planning. The dynamically downscaled triply nested Hawaii Regional Climate Model (HRCM) was modified from the WRF community model and calibrated to simulate the many microclimates on the Hawaiian archipelago. For the island of Maui, the HRCM was validated using 20 years of hindcast data, and daily projections were created at a 1 km scale to capture the steep topography and diverse rainfall regimes. Downscaled climate data are input into a USGS hydrological model to quantify groundwater recharge. This model was previously used for groundwater management, and is being expanded utilizing future climate projections, current land use maps and future scenario maps informed by stakeholder input.\nParticipatory scenario planning began in 2012 to bring together a diverse group of over 50 decision-makers in government, conservation, and agriculture to 1) determine the type of information they would find helpful in planning for climate change, and 2) develop a set of scenarios that represent alternative climate/management futures. This is an iterative process, resulting in flexible and transparent narratives at multiple scales. The resulting climate, land use, and groundwater recharge maps give stakeholders a common set of future scenarios that they understand through the participatory scenario process, and identify the vulnerabilities, trade-offs, and adaptive priorities for different groundwater management and land uses in an uncertain future.",

SAGANet.org, a web-based 501c3 Astrobiology outreach initiative, works with a number of schools, partnering K-12 students and their families with professional scientist mentors from around the world to teach and inspire students using virtual technology platforms. Current programs include two mentoring partnerships: pairing scientist-mentors with at-risk youth at the Pittsburg Community School in Pittsburg CA, and pairing scientist-mentors with families from the Kyrene del Cielo Elementary School in Chandler AZ. These programs represent two very different models for utilizing the virtual media platform provided by SAGANet.org to engage K-12 students and their families in STEM. For the former, scientists mentor the students of the Pittsburg School as part of the formal in-class curriculum. For the latter, scientists work with K-5 students and their families through Cielo’s Science & Engineering Discovery Room to develop a science project as part of an informal learning experience that is independent of the formal curriculum. In this presentation, we (1) discuss the challenges and successes of engaging these two distinct audiences through virtual media, (2) present the results of how these two very-different mentoring partnership impact K-12 students science self-efficacy, interest in science, and STEM career awareness, and (3) share the impact of the mentoring experience on the mentor’s confidence and self-efficacy with communicating science to the public.",

            "abstract": "Land-based sediments are a key threat to shallow coral reef ecosystems in Hawaii. Estimating sediment export is a critical step to being able to connect future land use changes with changes in sediment released to the coastal zone. However, empirically- and process-based hydrological models have proven difficult to adapt to Hawaii's geography, adding significant uncertainty to using available decision support tools. Four soil loss and sediment yield models, InVEST, N-SPECT, SWAT and GSSHA, were compared. Data including precipitation, flow discharge, and suspended sediment concentration were compiled from four leeward watersheds in the Hawaiian Islands. These were combined with the most recently available GIS data on soils, rainfall, land use and 10-m elevation. Results show that annual sediment export is typically underpredicted by an order of magnitude in the models. Moreover, soil loss predictions are spatially incongruent with field observations. Model results overestimate soil loss in the steep forested zones, where field observations show source material to be limited, and are not able to adequately capture human- and animal-disturbed material that connects hydrologically with the stream network. We suggest that the differences stem from a mismatch of processes that source sediments, including stream channel erosion and storage and shallow landslides, which are not included in all the models that are typically used for decision support. Moreover, different modeling platforms use different transport equations, which have not been validated for steep, mountainous watersheds. Changes in land use, such as new developments or cover crops, are obscured by models which consider steeply-sloped areas to be the primary source of sediment. The comparison suggests that decision support tools for Hawaii need a different approach for predicting sediment export with changing land use.",

            "abstract": "Sedimentation from tsunami on coastal plains is usually interpreted to be mainly an effect of flooding wave (runup). The role of backwash or water drainage phase in sedimentation is often local, particularly on flat wide coastal plains. However, in settings where coastal plain is more steep or the relatively narrow coastal plain is confined by steep slopes the significance of backwash phase in formation of tsunami deposits may be higher. Here we present data on sediment texture (grain size and roundness) from tsunami deposits and coastal sediments (beach, nearshore, marshes, slopes) collected in Vaigat Strait, western Greenland. This area was affected by landslide-triggered tsunami that occurred on 21st November 2000 and reached maximum reported runup height of 50 m a.s.l.. The studied sediments were collected from twelve cross-perpendicular transects. The tsunami deposits covered most of the inundation distance, which ranged from several tens of meters to over 300 m. The deposits thickness is over 30 cm thick close to the coast and in front of inland scarps. They were composed mainly of coarse sand to gravel. The analyses revealed that the major sediment source was beach and beach ridge. The grain size trends were fining landward in case of the widest coastal plain. However in narrower setting confined by steep slopes on the landward site, the deposits revealed coarsening landward, although they originated from beach and beach ridge. It may suggest that the sediments eroded by the tsunami from the beach were transported landward during the runup but not deposited. The deposition occurred during the backwash resulting in sorting of fractions.\nThe study was funded by Polish National Science Centre grant No. 2011/01/B/ST10/01553.

            "abstract": "Quantifying levels of microbial activity in unsaturated subsurface environments is an important factor for understanding exchange of greenhouse gases (e.g., CO2, CH4, N2O) with the atmosphere. For CO2, this is problematic due the variety of processes affecting its sources, fate and transport in the vadose zone (e.g., root respiration, carbonate dissolution and precipitation, exchange with pore water/groundwater and microbial production and consumption). To determine the impacts of all these processes and dependence on variables including temperature, moisture content and pH requires coupled numerical models supported by robust, long-term data sets. We are attempting to do this for a small (~90,000 m2) floodplain adjacent to the Colorado River in the town of Rifle, Colorado. The geology of the site consists of 6-8 m of Quaternary alluvium composed of quartz and feldspar sands with silts, clays, pebbles, and cobbles overlying the less permeable Tertiary Wasatch Formation. The unsaturated zone is 3-4 m thick overlying a perched aquifer above the alluvium-Wasatch contact. Depth-distributed gas samplers and suction lysimeters for pore water sampling were installed at three locations across the site in March of 2013. From April 2013 to present, soil gas samples have been collected on a bi-weekly to monthly interval and analyzed for gas concentrations and isotopic compositions. Through the first year, several significant spatial and temporal trends have emerged from the data including higher soil gas CO2 (up to 6% near the water table) with higher δ13C values during the warmer summer months, possibly signifying higher levels of microbial activity. In the shallower soils, CO2 concentrations are lower (atmospheric to 2%) with more variable δ13C values (ranging from -18‰ in the summer to -24‰ in the winter) likely due to slower exchange with the atmosphere during the winter when surface soils are more saturated due to snow cover and melting. Extensive data has also been collected on the concentrations and isotopic compositions of pore water organic carbon and groundwater DIC across the site in order to understand the effects of these components on carbon transport in the unsaturated zone. These data are being incorporated into a numerical model of the site that includes transport, chemical and biological reactions.",

            "abstract": "Artificial removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is increasingly discussed as a means to mitigate climate change, particularly in the context of meeting stringent climate targets. The efficiency of atmospheric CO2 removal is determined by the interplay between the natural carbon sinks and atmospheric CO2 levels. Only a few studies have explored the response of the global carbon cycle to atmospheric CO2 removal. Here, we use an Earth System model of intermediate complexity – the University of Victoria Earth System Climate Model (UVic ESCM) - to explore the response of the carbon cycle to atmospheric CO2 removal under a range of idealized scenarios, which differ in the total amount and rate of negative emissions, and the initial state of the system. We perform two sets of model simulations: one where a drop in atmospheric CO2 to a target level and maintenance at that level is prescribed (P), and one where an equivalent amount of negative CO2 emissions is prescribed over a given period of time, with atmospheric CO2 left to evolve freely thereafter (E).\nResults indicate that for both simulation sets, CO2 outgasses from the terrestrial biosphere and the ocean during the atmospheric CO2 removal phase. The amount of outgassing is sensitive to the experimental setup (P versus E simulations) and the rate of CO2 removal. We also find that a specific atmospheric CO2 target level is reached earlier in the E simulations compared to the P simulations, with the time lag increasing with decreasing rates of CO2 removal. For large amounts of CO2 removed from the atmosphere (>150 ppm), maintenance of atmospheric CO2 at the target level requires continued negative emissions to counter outgassing of CO2 from the marine and terrestrial carbon sinks. In contrast, for low to moderate amounts of CO2 removed (<100 ppm), maintenance of the target CO2 level allows for emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere, due to uptake of CO2 by carbon sinks. Accordingly, if atmospheric CO2 is left to evolve freely after the removal effort, atmospheric CO2 rebounds for large amounts of CO2 removed and continues to decline for moderate amounts removed.",

Unlike on Enceladus, Europa receives significant amount of electron and particle radiation. If the plumes come from trailing hemisphere and in the high radiation flux regions, then it is expected that the plume molecules be subjected to radiation processing. Our interest is to understand to what extent such radiation alterations occur and how they can be correlated to the plume original composition, whether organic or inorganic in nature.\nWe will present laboratory studies [Henderson and Gudipati 2014] involving pulsed infrared laser ablation of ice that generates plumes similar to those observed on Enceladus [Hansen, Esposito et al. 2006; Hansen, Shemansky et al. 2011] and expected to be similar on Europa as a starting point; demonstrating the applicability of laser ablation to simulate plumes of Europa and Enceladus. We will present results from electron irradiation of these plumes to determine how organic and inorganic composition is altered due to radiation.\nAcknowledgments:\nThis research was enabled through partial funding from NASA funding through Planetary Atmospheres, and the Europa Clipper Pre-Project.

            "abstract": "One potential benefit of an ensemble prediction system (EPS) is its capacity to forecast its own forecast error through the ensemble spread-error relationship. In practice, an EPS is often quite limited in its ability to represent the variable expectation of forecast error through the variable dispersion of the ensemble, and perhaps more fundamentally, in its ability to provide enough variability in the ensembles dispersion to make the skill-spread relationship even potentially useful (irrespective of whether the EPS is well-calibrated or not).\nIn this paper we examine the ensemble skill-spread relationship of an ensemble constructed from the TIGGE (THORPEX Interactive Grand Global Ensemble) dataset of global forecasts and a combination of multi-model and post-processing approaches. Both of the multi-model and post-processing techniques are based on quantile regression (QR) under a step-wise forward selection framework leading to ensemble forecasts with both good reliability and sharpness. The methodology utilizes the ensemble’s ability to self-diagnose forecast instability to produce calibrated forecasts with informative skill-spread relationships.\nA context for these concepts is provided by assessing the constructed ensemble in forecasting district-level humidity impacting the incidence of meningitis in the meningitis belt of Africa, and in forecasting flooding events in the Brahmaputra and Ganges basins of South Asia.",

As an area of a major continental-continental collision, Bhutan Himalaya has been subject to a considerable amount of deformation and transpression, and it contains features of the five major shear zones of the Himalayas. Extensive seismic analysis of the region, however, is lacking due to sparse coverage and complexity of its crustal structure. We examine seismic event data from a temporary seismic network deployed in the Kingdom of Bhutan (2002-2003) using the double difference tomographic inversion technique TomoFDD, which allows for the joint inversion of event relocations and seismic velocity structure. Our primary focus is on ~200 regional events surrounding the five-station network. The events are located between 86° and 100°E longitude, and 18° and 31°N latitude, and with depths between 10 and 400 km. To extend our model area, we also incorporate GSN stations LSA, KMI, and CHTO. Prior analysis of this dataset consisted of event location, relocation, and 1D velocity modeling. We leverage on previous studies and build a new 3D seismic velocity model of the crust and upper mantle underneath the Bhutan region to gain further insight on the seismicity and crustal assessment.",

            "abstract": "To identify and utilize paleo-tsunami deposits, it’s important to understand the diversity in characteristics of the deposits due to the deposit materials and environmental settings. We excavated a L-shape trench (10m land-sea direction and 5m along the shore) in a wetland located ca. 500m inland from the beach. Along the eastern coast of Hokkaido, Japan, including our trench site Urahoro, it has been revealed that unusually large earthquakes occurred about every 400 years on average over several thousands years (eg. Nanayama et al., 2003). Along the trench walls (total length of 28.7m), we could observe distribution and sedimentary features of sandy or muddy tsunami (or tsunami like) layers and five widespread tephras in ca. 2m-thick peat developed in 4000-5000 years. Characteristics of these layers are, although they are deposited at the same site, not resemble each other. The youngest two layers lying between the Ta-b tephra (AD 1667) and B-Tm tephra (10th Century) are relatively thick and coarse, and their thickness varied 34-7 cm for the first layer and 16-0 cm for the second. For both layers, upper boundaries are relatively flat but the lower ones are rising periodically with intervals of 50cm to 1m. Since these intervals are similar to the present-day spacing of tussocks on the wetland, the both tsunami layers might be formed on a tussock-dominated wetland. The deposit thickness of the first sand layer was probably thicker than the tussock heights at that time. Grain size patterns are also affected by the original surface undulation and change between seaside and landside of a buried tussock. On the other hand, the older tsunami deposits seem to be deposited on flat plains. Thickness of the layers ranges 2 to 10cm and they show sheet-like distribution and stable grain size characteristics along the trench. One layer accompanies a thick (10cm) mud cap, suggesting existence of a pond or lagoon at seaside of the trench at that time.",

            "abstract": "The Indian monsoon is the critical source of freshwater for over one billion people. Variability in monsoon precipitation occurs on all time scales and has severe consequences for the people who depend on monsoon rains. Extreme precipitation events have increased in the 20th century and are predicted to continue to become more frequent with anthropogenic global warming. The most recent models project that both monsoon precipitation and variability of precipitation will increase over the 21st century leading to increased flooding and possibly severe droughts. Although current models are able to capture the risk of relatively short droughts (1-5 years) reasonably well, they tend to underestimate the risk of longer, decadal- multidecadal droughts. I use observational records over the last 100 years in conjunction with cave, tree ring, and lake data from the NOAA paleoclimate database to reconstruct Holocene monsoon variability. I am able to show that the Asian monsoon has more low frequency variability than is projected by current climate models. The growing evidence for this discrepancy in hydroclimate variability between models and observational/paleoclimate records is of grave concern. If these models fail to capture the decadal-multidecadal droughts of the past it is likely they will underestimate the possibility of such droughts in the future.",

            "abstract": "Using the Community Earth System Model (CESM), we develop geographically differentiated estimates of radiative forcing from albedo change associated with major land cover transitions across 151 regions globally. The regions are formed through the intersectrion of 18 agro-ecological zones with 15 geo-political units, and correspond to the agricultural and land-use decision regions utilized by the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM). Incorporating these forcing factors into GCAM allows us to calculate total radiative forcing associated with alternative scenarios of future anthropogenic land cover change. We find that conversion of 1 km2 of woody vegetation (forest and shrublands) to non-woody vegetation (crops and grassland) yields between 0 to ‑0.71 nW/m2 of globally averaged radiative forcing, depending on regional vegetation characteristics, snow dynamics, and atmospheric radiation environments. Across a set of scenarios designed to span a range of potential future anthropogenic landcover change, we find albedo forcing ranging from ‑0.05 to ‑0.25 W/m2 by 2070. The scenarios vary in terms of assumptions regarding future crop yield growth and climate policies, which could favor either afforestation or bioenergy crops. This range of forcing is similar in magnitude to central estimates for present-day forcing from historical land cover change and to several other forcing agents including nitrous oxide.",

We use P- and S-wave amplitude spectra from all >M5.7 deep earthquakes recorded by the TA to examine seismic attenuation patterns in the upper mantle. More than 2 million inter-station P-wave spectral ratios were inverted for maps of relative tP* variations across the U.S. in multiple frequency bands between 0.08 – 2 Hz. We plan to have corresponding S-wave results by meeting time. Maps of tP* are strongly correlated (>0.8) for frequency bands of 0.08 – 2 Hz, 0.25 – 2 Hz, 0.08 – 1 Hz, and 0.25 – 1 Hz. The broader the frequency band examined (e.g. 0.08 – 2 Hz), the lower the magnitude in variations of tP*; however, those broader frequency bands still exhibited geographic patterns similar to the narrow frequency bands. We compare our maps’ tP* with seismic velocity models and constraints on crustal scattering to assess the physical origin of apparent attenuation. In the tectonically active and high heat flow domain of the western U.S., tP* variations are moderately correlated with thermal variations predicted by tomography studies of seismic velocity. However, contrast in tP* between western Cordillera and the cratonic interior is weaker than predicted by tomography. Additionally some areas of high attenuation are correlated with Precambrian tectonic boundaries within the Laurentian craton. The weak contrast between the western and eastern U.S. and correlations with Precambrian tectonics suggest that elastic scattering due to small-scale (~10 – 100 km) heterogeneity or compositional variations in the lithosphere are major contributors to tP* estimates from deep earthquake spectral ratios. Moderate correlation of tP* with estimates of mantle temperature within the western U.S. suggests deep earthquake spectral ratios do carry some evidence of intrinsic attenuation, but separating the effects of elastic scattering and intrinsic attenuation remains a challenge.",

Satellite and airborne data with medium to high spatial resolution have been used to perform a change detection analysis and study the evolution of the spatial distribution of mangrove trees. Empirical relations of vegetation indexes with field data collected over time have been determined, and specifically the correlation with leaf production, branch length increment, soil moisture and salinity, soil NH4 concentration and nitrification/denitrification processes. The field data had already shown how locally the higher nitrogen availability and the lower soil salinity increased Black mangrove growth mainly in areas with dwarf and sparse mangrove cover.

Current estimates and future projections of the EAIS contribution to sea-level rise have errors much greater than the magnitude, indicating the sign of its contribution remains under debate. The low magnitude and high interannual variability in the accumulation rate, coupled with relatively short and few accumulation records, generates a large portion of the uncertainty. Here, we present annually resolved accumulation records from two near-coastal and two interior firn cores from Dronning Maud Land. In addition, three multi-decadal records derived from volcanic chronologies provide coarser records from three sites along the western side of the plateau divide. Most of the firn cores were collected along the Norwegian-US IPY traverse in 2007 and 2008, and the records range between 393 and 2,195 years in length, five of which are more than 1,000 years long.\nOur results provide a valuable dataset to investigate the periods of significant accumulation changes through the past hundreds to thousands of years, and provide a long-term reference period with which to compare the recent accumulation rates. Interestingly, the sign and magnitude of the relative difference in accumulation between the recent and long-term rates varies by location. We combine the records presented with other published firn core records from the region to investigate the spatial pattern of recent changes in the accumulation rate. Finally, the impact of the recent changes in accumulation rates observed in the records on ice-sheet mass balance is discussed both in terms of the input-output evaluation and interpretations of surface elevation change.",

            "abstract": "The Canadian arctic has experienced increasing temperatures over the past century leading to heightened rate of glacial retreat. Glacial retreat leads to subsequent exposure of foreland soils to atmospheric conditions, thus creating a sequence of change in these ecosystems. Microbes are critical for soil development and nutrient dynamics in glacial systems as they are the primary colonizers of these soils and have been demonstrated to play a role in geochemical weathering and nutrient cycling beneath the glacier. Although viable microbial communities exist beneath glaciers and are known to be important for the glacial ecosystem, the impact of glacial retreat on these communities and development of the resulting foreland ecosystem is not well understood. Here, we investigate how microbial communities respond to changing conditions brought on by glacial retreat and whether a pattern of succession, such as those found in well characterized plant systems, occurs along a soil foreland in these microbial communities. We hypothesis that time since deglaciation is the major determinant of structure and composition of microbial assemblages. To test this, soil samples were collected along two glacier forelands, Trapridge Glacier and Duke River Glacier, located in Kluane National Park, Yukon Territory. Chronosequence dating of satellite images using geographic information system software revealed sampling sites have been ice-free from ~30 years to over 60 years. Soil chemistry analysis of major nutrients revealed no change in chemical parameters along the chronosequence, suggesting that presence of microbes after exposure from subglacial environments does not significantly alter soil characteristics in the timeframe observed. Furthermore, next-generation IonTorrentTM sequencing performed on soil samples revealed over five million sequencing reads, suggesting prominent microbial presence within these soils. Further analysis on sequencing data is needed to establish the influence, if any, that microbes have in the development of the soils after deglaciation. Overall, this study investigates the effect global climate change has on the fragile glacier ecosystems of the Canadian arctic by identifying the unique role microbes have as the primary colonizers of these systems.",

            "abstract": "The juxtaposition of mylonitic mid-crustal rocks and faulted supracrustal rocks in metamorphic core complexes (MMCs) is usually portrayed in 2 dimensions and attributed to a single event of large-scale slip ± isostatic doming along a low-angle “detachment fault\"/ shear zone. This paradigm does not explain dramatic along strike (3-D) variations in slip magnitude, footwall architecture, and burial / exhumation histories of most MMCs. A fundamental question posed by MMCs is how did their earlier thickening and exhumation histories influence the geometric evolution and 3-D slip distribution on the subsequent detachment faults? New geologic mapping and 40Ar/39Ar thermochronology from the Snake Range-Kern Mts-Deep Creek Mts (SKDC) complex in eastern Nevada offer important insights into this question. Crustal shortening and thickening by large-scale non-cylindrical recumbent folds and associated thrust faults during the late Cretaceous (90-80 Ma) resulted in deep burial (650°C, 20-25 km) of the central part of the footwall, but metamorphic grade decreases dramatically to the N and S in concert with decreasing amplitude on the shortening structures. Subsequent Paleogene extensional exhumation by normal faulting and ESE-directed mylonitic shearing is greatest in areas of maximum earlier thickening and brought highest grade rocks back to depths of~10-12 km. After ≥15 Ma of quiescence, rapid E-directed slip initiated along the brittle Miocene Snake Range detachment at 20 Ma and reactivated the Eocene shear zone. The ≥200°C gradient across the footwall at this time implies that the Miocene slip surface originated as a moderately E-dipping normal fault. This Miocene slip surface can be tracked for more than 100 km along strike, but the greatest amount of Miocene slip also coincides with parts of the footwall that were most deeply buried in the Cretaceous. These relations indicate that not only is the SKDC MMC a composite feature, but that the crustal welt created by early thickening played a fundamental role in controlling the slip distribution on subsequent extensional structures and is still evident in the high modern surface elevations of the portions of the footwall what were most deeply buried.",

The courses are suitable for students of all ages, and use professionally narrated animations designed to hold a viewer’s attention. Multiple issues are covered, including complex concerns like the construction of general circulation models, carbon pricing schemes in various countries, and adaptation approaches in the face of extreme weather events. Clips will be shown in the presentation. The first course (Climate Science Basics) has now been seen by over two hundred thousand individuals in over 80 countries, despite being offered in English only. Each course takes about two hours to work through, and in recognizing that that duration might pose an attention barrier to some students, PICS selected a number of short clips from the climate-science course and posted them as independent snippets on YouTube. A companion series of YouTube videos entitled, “Clear The Air”, was created to confront the major global-warming denier myths. But a major challenge remains: despite numerous efforts to promote the availability of the free courses and the shorter YouTube pieces, they have yet to become widely known. Strategies to overcome that constraint will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Large Area Imaging (LAI) systems such as the Carl Zeiss \"Atlas\" module allow acquisition of SEM images on the scale of millimeters to centimeters with an image resolution ranging from nanometers to micrometers. This provides researchers with the powerful capability to investigate large areas of up to tens of millimeters in scale and expand anywhere within these areas to see details on the micrometer to nanometer scale while retaining full contextual information regarding the areas under investigation.\nBiogeochemical processes operate on multiple scales and evidence of these phenomena can be difficult to observe across scales. For example, microbial etching of glass occurs on a nanometer scale as organic acids locally lower pH and destabilize Si-O bonds. However, interpreting a pattern of glass etching as abiotic or biogenic depends on observations at the micrometer to centimeter scale to assess evidence for microbial populations and/or biological behavior, assess fluid flow, changes in elemental composition and mineralogy. LAI is particularly suited to the investigation of multi-scale, interdisciplinary biogeochemical datasets.\nUsing LAI we have generated contiguous image data at resolutions as high as 100 nm (pixel size) for areas approaching 25 cm2, using backscattered and secondary electrons in both traditional high vacuum and variable pressure SEM modes. Image stitching produces seamless mosaics composed of multiple image tiles; mosaic acquisition times can be as little as a few hours of fully automated operation.\nUsing this primary information, additional micrometer-scale data sets such as EDX spectroscopy, millimeter-scale datasets such as transmitted light photomicrographs, and nanometer-scale information such as synchrotron-based spectroscopy, can be registered and fused with the LAI SEM images. LAI and data fusion facilitates critical connections across spatial scales to test hypotheses that cross the threshold of traditional microscopy methods.",

            "abstract": "Advances in sensor-driven computation and computationally steered sensing will greatly enable future research in fields including environmental and atmospheric sciences. We will present “Waggle,” an open-source hardware and software infrastructure developed with two goals: (1) reducing the separation and latency between sensing and computing and (2) improving the reliability and longevity of sensing-actuation platforms in challenging and costly deployments. Inspired by “deep-space probe” systems, the Waggle platform design includes features that can support longitudinal studies, deployments with varying communication links, and remote management capabilities. Waggle lowers the barrier for scientists to incorporate real-time data from their sensors into their computations and to manipulate the sensors or provide feedback through actuators. A standardized software and hardware design allows quick addition of new sensors/actuators and associated software in the nodes and enables them to be coupled with computational codes both insitu and on external compute infrastructure. The Waggle framework currently drives the deployment of two observational systems – a portable and self-sufficient weather platform for study of small-scale effects in Chicago's urban core and an open-ended distributed instrument in Chicago that aims to support several research pursuits across a broad range of disciplines including urban planning, microbiology and computer science. Built around open-source software, hardware, and Linux OS, the Waggle system comprises two components – the Waggle field-node and Waggle cloud-computing infrastructure. Waggle field-node affords a modular, scalable, fault-tolerant, secure, and extensible platform for hosting sensors and actuators in the field. It supports insitu computation and data storage, and integration with cloud-computing infrastructure. The Waggle cloud infrastructure is designed with the goal of scaling to several hundreds of thousands of Waggle nodes. It supports aggregating data from sensors hosted by the nodes, staging computation, relaying feedback to the nodes and serving data to end-users. We will discuss the Waggle design principles and their applicability to various observational research pursuits, and demonstrate its capabilities.",

In highly nonlinear systems, where fluctuations can significantly alter the mean macroscale behavior of the system of interest, the accuracy of the numerical time integration scheme depends critically on its ability to correctly propagate noise both in each physics component and across the intercomponent interface. Using two multiscale nonlinear parabolic problems excited by a white noise at one of the boundaries as test cases, we propose a partitioned, tightly-coupled time integration scheme and analyze its ability to capture noise propagation across a coupling interface and evaluate the computational efficiency and accuracy of the coupling.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is projected to affect the integrity of forested ecosystems worldwide. One forest type expected to be severely impacted is the eastern spruce-fir forest, because it is already at the extreme elevational and latitudinal limits of its range within the northern United States. Large-scale bioclimactic models predict declining habitat suitability for spruce and fir species, while causing drought and thermal stress on remnant trees. As rising temperatures reduce or eliminate habitat throughout much of the current spruce-fir range, growth and regeneration of hardwood forests or more southerly conifers will be favored.\nThe ecotone between northern hardwood forests and montane boreal forests was recently reported to have shifted approximately 100 m upslope over the last 20-40 years in the Green Mountains of Vermont, U.S.A. The research behind this finding relied on long-term forest plot data and change analysis of narrow transects (6 m width) on aerial photos and SPOT imagery. In the White Mountains of New Hampshire, U.S.A., research using vegetation indices from Landsat data reported a conflicting finding; that coniferous vegetation was increasing downslope of the existing ecotone. We carefully matched and topographically corrected Landsat images from 1989 through 2011 to comprehensively map the boreal-temperate forest ecotone throughout the Green Mountains in Vermont, U.S.A. We used edge detection and linear mixed models to evaluate whether the ecotone changed in elevation over 20 years, and whether rates of change varied with Latitude or aspect.\nWe found that the elevation of the boreal-temperate forest ecotone, and changes in its location over 20 years, were more variable than reported in recent studies. While the ecotone moved to higher elevations in some locations at reported rates, these rates were at the tales of the distribution of elevational change. Other locations showed downward movement of the ecotone, while for the majority of sites, no change was detected. The large variability in both the rate and direction of elevational change of the boreal-temperate forest ecotone suggests that current changes cannot be attributed clearly to climate change, but may equally reflect forest dynamics of older forests senescing and being replaced locally by competing species.",

The value of these measurements increases when sites are revisited seasonally and/or interannually to capture the dynamic range of coastal landforms. Static measurements of the shoreface have been collected by a number of stakeholders in Alaska since the 1960s, but, have not historically been published or made readily accessible. In cooperation with the Alaska Ocean Observing System, the Alaska Division of Geological & Geophysical Surveys (DGGS) has designed a universal data repository to house these coastal measurements. This new database has an interactive map interface that enables easy access to existing profile locations to encourage repeat observations. Users can explore profile measurements collected by DGGS and others as time-series plots and location-based images of the shoreface environment. The database has been designed to accommodate datasets collected with differing techniques, including differential leveling, survey-grade GPS or extraction from lidar-derived digital elevation models. Non-DGGS profile measurements, including community-led efforts, University of Alaska project datasets, and archived United States Geological Survey coastal profiles have also been incorporated into the database and contributions from other entities are welcomed. In addition to exhibiting the new interactive map capabilities, we also provide a case study example from Yakutat, Alaska illustrating how this tool can be incorporated into broader investigations of coastal dynamics and how these measurements can augment shoreline change assessments. The readily accessible nature of this database also promotes local involvement in community-based coastal monitoring, also demonstrated in the Yakutat example.",

The proposed method leverages the spatial and temporal co-occurrence of thermal anomalies and vegetation loss caused due to forest fires to detect burned areas. Our approach derives features from Enhanced Vegetation Index that target locations which show an abrupt change in their vegetation time series that take at least several months to recover. One unique aspect of our approach is that it uses data from multiple months around the fire event and is therefore more robust to issues in data quality. Comparison with other burned area products show that our approach detects several large previously undetected burned areas across multiple geographical regions. In particular, we found that our approach detects several large burned regions in the tropical forests of Indonesia and South America that had been missed by the state-of-arts burned area approaches. For example, using our approach in Indonesia we discovered that the state-of-the-art MODIS Burned area product had missed around 20,000 sq. km. of burned area (nearly as much burned area as it has reported). We show that all these previously unreported burned areas detected by our approach are actually significant fires which suffered a large, abrupt loss in their vegetation at the time of the fire event and take at least several months to recover back to their normal vegetation. To evaluate these burned areas we compared the Landsat-based composites before and after the date of the event. Our Landsat analysis shows that the burned areas detected by the proposed approach are true burns with a very small error of commission. We believe our work has the potential to provide a scalable approach to global forest monitoring as well as reduce the uncertainty in quantifying the carbon emissions from forests due to fire activity.",

Here we present a novel method to compare extratropical shortwave cloud feedbacks in models and observations based on the sensitivity of liquid water path to temperature and humidity in a reference climate.\nWe first regress monthly-mean LWP onto 850 hPa temperature and relative humidity at each point across the seasonal cycle in the historical climate of CMIP5 models and in observations, and multiply the regression coefficients by the RCP8.5 temperature and humidity response to yield a “predicted LWP response.” This compares very well with the actual response (0.70 < r < 0.95) across the extratropics (35°-70° N and S) in the annual and zonal mean. We then determine the relationship between historical monthly-mean LWP and SW cloud-radiative effect (CRE) for each model, latitude, and month, excluding land gridpoints. For observations, the LWP data are combined with CERES retrievals for 2000-2008. These LWP-SWCRE relationships then allow us to predict the SW response for a given LWP change.\nThe predicted SWcld feedback is generally well-correlated with the actual SWcld feedback in the Southern Hemisphere (0.45 < r < 0.75), while the prediction has less skill in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, the SW feedback prediction has a mean negative bias of about 1 W m-2, likely due to changes in cloud microphysics not accounted for by our model. Importantly, however, the SWcld feedback predicted from observations agrees very well in magnitude and meridional structure with the multi-model mean predicted SWcld feedback. Both models and observations tend to predict a meridional dipole in SWcld feedback with a transition from negative values in the midlatitudes to positive values in the subtropics, similar to the actual SWcld feedback in RCP8.5 simulations.",

            "abstract": "Without slope stability mitigation, liquefaction-induced settlement in bay mud and Pleistocene alluvial deposits may lead to the collapse of levee walls surrounding sanitary landfills that are located adjacent to the San Francisco Bay. To analyze the effectiveness of a slope stability mitigation project involving deep soil mixing at Newby Island Sanitary Landfill in San Jose, California, we acquired P- and S-wave seismic surveys along a transect through the mitigated region during, and two years after, completion of the mitigation project. Deep soil mixing involves the injection of a cement slurry in augered holes, resulting in groups of soil-cement columns (elements) that are intended to increase the strength and rigidity of the subsurface materials.\nFor our seismic investigations, we used accelerated-weight-drop (AWD) and hammer impacts to generate P- and S-wave seismic sources, respectively, at 57 geophone locations, spaced 5 m apart. The resulting seismic data were recorded using 40-Hz, vertical-component (P-wave) and 4.5-Hz, horizontal-component (S-wave) sensors. Initially, we developed tomographic refraction (velocity) images along a progressive transition from a yet-to-be-mitigated area into a more recently mitigated area, located along the base of a steep slope composed of compacted landfill. The initial survey revealed an increase in seismic velocity in the treated area, seismic velocity increases with curing time for soil-cement elements, and a high-velocity zone beneath the active injection zone. The influence of the mitigation was most apparent from increases in Vp/Vs and Poisson’s ratios. To assess the long-term effects of the mitigation project, an identical, follow-up survey was acquired in July 2014, 23 months after the initial survey. We present a comparative analysis of the tomographic images from the two surveys, variations in Vp/Vs and Poisson’s ratios over time, and a comparison of in situ, time-varying seismic parameters with laboratory-based observations of curing times as a function of cement density. We also compare S-wave velocities with cone penetrometer testing (CPT) data, acquired prior to the mitigation project, to infer changes in the subsurface over time.",

            "abstract": "Helene, the Saturnian L4 Trojan satellite co-orbiting Dionne and sitting within the E-ring, possesses an unusual morphology characteristic of broad km-scale basins and depressions and a generally smooth surface patterned with streaks and grooves which are indicative of non-typical mass transport. Elevation angles do not appear to exceed 10o at most. The nature and origin of the surface materials forming these grooved patterns is unknown. Given the low surface gravity (<5mm/s2), it hard to imagine how such transport features can come about with such low grades and surface gravities. Preliminary examinations of classical linear and nonlinear mass wasting mechanisms do not appear to reproduce these curious features. A suite of hypothesis that we examine is the possibility that the fine grain material on the surface has been either (i) accreted or (ii) generated as refractory detritus resulting from sublimation of the icy bedrock, and that these materials subsequently mass-waste like a non-Newtonian highly non-linear creeping flow. Modifying the landform evolution model MARSSIM to handle two new mass-wasting mechanism, the first due to glacial-like flow via Glen's Law and the second due to plastic-like flow like a Bingham fluid, we setup and test a number of likely scenarios to explain the observations. The numerical results qualitatively indicate that treating the mass-wasting materials as a Bingham material reproduces many of the qualitative features observed. We also find that in those simulations in which accretion is concomitant with Bingham mass-wasting, the long time-evolution of the surface flow shows intermittency in the total surface activity (defined as total surface integral of the absolute magnitude of the mass-flux). Detailed analyses identify the locations where this activity is most pronounced and we will discuss these and its implications in further detail.",

One of the key features of those interactions is the feedback of soil moisture on precipitation, which reflects the coupling between soil moisture and evapotranspiration on the one hand, and between evapotranspiration and precipitation on the other hand. Global climate models have been known to show large uncertainties in the simulation of this coupling – in particular regarding the latter, atmospheric branch. Here we use the TFS metric (developed by Findell et al. 2011) to characterize these uncertainties, investigating the simulated sensitivity of precipitation to surface turbulent fluxes in CMIP5 models (in present climate): this analysis assesses the impact of evaporative fraction on the frequency and intensity of convective rainfall at the sub-daily time scale. Beyond geographical patterns, the relationship between background climate, evaporative regimes and the simulated coupling is analyzed. Particular attention is also given to the interaction between the representation of the diurnal cycle of precipitation and the diagnosed evaporation-precipitation in the models.",

            "abstract": "Discussions of recent climate change usually center around average surface temperature. Although temperature is important and easily interpreted, there is no conservation law for surface temperature as there is for energy. Energy conservation can therefore add to the discussion. For example, we are certain that increasing carbon dioxide is causing the Earth to retain energy. Any explanation of climate change must account for that energy. For the period when ocean data are available (1957-2013), the ocean heat content, IPCC AR5 estimates of forcing, and increased thermal emission from a warming Earth together produce a self-consistent energy budget. Emission from a warming Earth has balanced more greenhouse gas energy than has ocean heat uptake. Positive/negative cloud feedbacks on climate are consistent with an aerosol forcing larger/smaller than the central value.\nWith experience in using the energy budget in teaching an undergraduate course on climate science, we are trying to show the simplest possible energy budget that accurately conveys the science.",

This limitation can make observing subtle trends across years difficult. The goal of this presentation is to demonstrate a conceptual approach and a computational technique to quantify seasonal, annual and long-term phenological indices and patterns, based on continuous eddy covariance measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) measured at eddy covariance towers in the AmeriFlux network. Using a comprehensive time series analysis of NEE fluxes in different climatic zones, we determined multiple characteristics (and their confidence intervals) of the growing season including: the initiation day—the day when canopy photosynthesis development starts, the photosynthesis stabilization day - the day when the development process of canopy photosynthesis starts to slow down and gradually moves toward stabilization, and the growing season effective termination day. We also determined the spring photosynthetic development velocity and the fall photosynthetic development velocity. The results of calculations using NEE were compared with those from temperature and precipitation data measured at the same AmeriFlux tower stations, as well as with the in-situ directly observed phenological records. The results of calculations of phenological indices from the NEE time-series collected at AmeriFlux sites can be used to constrain the application of other time- and labor-intensive sensing methods and to reduce the uncertainty in identifying trends in the timing of phenological indices.",

Climate Education Partners has been working with business leaders, elected officials, tribal leaders, and other Key Influentials in the San Diego Region to enhance the channels of communication outside traditional settings. Over the past year we have interviewed over 90 Key Influential San Diego leaders asking them about their knowledge of climate change and their personal and professional efforts to adapt to and/or mitigate the impacts of climate change. We also engaged them directly in the creation of an innovative educational resource called “San Diego, 2050 is Calling. How will we answer?” Results of the interviews indicate that 90% of these leaders are concerned about climate change, more than 50% are already doing something about the impacts, and the majority of them want more information, greater dialogue and examples of actions taken by other community leaders. We found that repeated engagement of leaders at the San Diego County Water Authority went from basic collaboration in our water tours, to greater participation of their top leaders in a water tour for top decision makers from the City of San Diego, finally culminating with full support of and participation in the 2050 report. The 2050 report represents an integrated approach blending local climate change science, social science education theory and presentation of a suite of solution-driven opportunities for local leaders. The report includes science infographics that illustrate rigorous scientific facts, statements from expert scientists and direct quotes from decision makers, and examples of successful climate change adaptation actions from companies, government groups and others. The video and photography sessions for the 2050 report led to many unexpected discussion among leaders with differing opinions on climate change, greater enthusiasm to participate in outreach activities with other leaders and an increased willingness to share their successes publicly. Climate Education Partners is finding that linking excellent local science with healthy community dialogue is resulting in San Diego leaders and their communities making more informed decisions on how to adapt to climate change now and for all future generations.",

            "abstract": "The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) developed a design rainfall generator - Dynamic Moving Storm (DMS). DMS is a unique tool because it accounts for three major factors of real rainfall events simultaneously that other tools do not: (1) spatial variability, (2) temporal variability, and (3) directional movement. The rainfall intensity distribution with a storm is normally referred to spatial variability factor. The DMS builder takes in account storm sizes, shapes, and orientations (for non-circular storms) within the spatial variability module. Given rainfall intensity within the storm always varies with respect of time, the builder has a capability of specifying temporal distributions of rainfall intensities following linear or exponential patterns. To represent the dynamic motions of real storms, the researchers at UTA developed a movement module into DMS to handle combinations of accelerations, decelerations, pause and turns. Typically, an idealized storm generated by DMS can be presented as a circular shape in 2-D and conic shape in 3-D views. While it moves across a watershed, the rainfall pattern within the storm follows a certain temporal pattern. Once various combinations of spatial, temporal, and movement factors are input into the DMS builder, it can generate corresponding elliptical-shaped rainfall contours with rainfall hyetographs for each subbasin of a particular watershed. The resulted rainfall information can then be fed into hydrologic models to evaluate the spatiotemporal impacts for any watersheds. This paper demonstrates a case study using DMS builder to access the vulnerability for the Brays Bayou watershed in Houston, Texas.",

But if emergency planners also fail to realize the possibility of a particular disaster scenario, there is very little chance that the public will plan for it. In Southern California there is a well-known risk associated with earthquakes, and it would be difficult to find anyone that didn't understand that the region was subject to risk from earthquakes. On the other hand, few, if any people consider the risk associated with tropical storms or hurricanes. This is reasonable considering people have always been told that the west coast of the United States is immune from hurricanes due to the cold water associated with the California Current, and the hazard of earthquakes is fairly obvious to anyone that has lived the for a while. Such an attitude is probably justifiable for most of Southern California, but it's unclear whether this is true for the San Diego region: destructive earthquakes are historically rare, and there is good evidence that the region was affected by a Category 1 hurricane in 1858. Indeed, during the last 70 years, more people have died from tropical cyclones in Calfornia's southernmost counties (San Diego and Imperial) than have died from earthquakes. In this paper we compare the relative risks from these two different types of disasters for the San Diego region, and attempt to answer why one type of hazard is emphasized in public planning and the other is neglected.",

Changes to the snowpack between the 1981-2000 and 2081-2100 periods are investigated using dynamical downscaling with WRF v3.2 coupled to the NOAH-MP land surface model, at 3km resolution. First, a baseline run is performed in which WRF is forced by North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) for the 1981-2000 period. Based on a comparison between this baseline simulation and station data from the California Department of Water Resources, WRF is shown to have high model skill in reproducing snow water equivalent (SWE) variability. Next, five future runs are performed in order to simulate how that same baseline period would transpire if the mean climate were altered to reflect the climate change signal found in five CMIP5 GCMs. All five runs show an overall decline in April 1st SWE, but some runs show increased SWE at high elevations. SWE changes are influenced by competing factors including reduced precipitation falling as snow, increased total precipitation, and enhanced melting. Snow at lower elevations is highly temperature sensitive, so lower elevations experience higher fractional SWE losses. Meanwhile, higher elevations may still be below freezing under a warmer climate, so increased precipitation can lead to increased snowfall. The largest SWE losses occur at intermediate elevations that are cold enough to maintain moderate SWE levels during the baseline, but are still sensitive to temperature changes.",

            "abstract": "Many studies since 2004 have documented the dissemination and receipt of risk information for local to distant tsunamis and factors influencing people’s responses. A few earlier tsunami studies and numerous studies of other hazards provide additional support for developing effective tsunami messages. This study explores evidence-based approaches to developing such messages for the Pacific and National Tsunami Warning Centers in the US. It extends a message metric developed for the NWS Tsunami Program.\nPeople at risk to tsunamis receive information from multiple sources through multiple channels. Sources are official and informal and environmental and social cues. Traditionally, official tsunami messages followed a linear dissemination path through relatively few channels from warning center to emergency management to public and media. However, the digital age has brought about a fundamental change in the dissemination and receipt of official and informal communications. Information is now disseminated in very non-linear paths and all end-user groups may receive the same message simultaneously.\nResearch has demonstrated a range of factors that influence rapid respond to an initial real or perceived threat. Immediate response is less common than one involving delayed protective actions where people first engage in “milling behavior” to exchange information and confirm the warning before taking protective action. The most important message factors to achieve rapid response focus on the content and style of the message and the frequency of dissemination.\nPreviously we developed a tsunami message metric consisting of 21 factors divided into message content and style and receiver characteristics. Initially, each factor was equally weighted to identify gaps, but here we extend the work by weighting specific factors. This utilizes recent research that identifies the most important determinants of protective action. We then discuss the prioritization of message information in the context of potentially limited space in evolving tsunami messages issued by the warning centers.",

            "abstract": "The Tephra 2014 Workshop was convened 3-7 August, 2014, to discuss major developments, best practices, and future directions/needs in tephra studies from both volcanological and tephrochronological perspectives. By bringing together an international group of over 70 scientists with a variety of backgrounds who study tephra for different purposes, our hope was to enhance interdisciplinary collaboration and data sharing. To provide training, the workshop also incorporated hands-on sessions on optimal sample collection and treatment, dispersal modeling, and the use of databases. Volcanologists, tephrochronologists, archaeologists, paleoclimatologists, paleoecologists, paleolimnologists, petrologists, geochronologists, tectonophysicists, Quaternary scientists, atmospheric scientists, data managers, and others who work with tephra were represented.\nDuring three days of presentation and discussion, tephra scientists discussed challenges, opportunities and solutions in studies ranging from physical volcanology to archeology. A consensus-seeking session was held at the end of the meeting, in which the current state of the science and emergent issues were raised. Most of the discussion in the session revolved around formulating common best practices among the different scientific communities and establishing common data archiving and retrieval mechanisms. Best practices were discussed in terms of sample collection and laboratory treatment. It was felt that a starting point for ensuring some uniformity in collection and laboratory work was to develop data sheets or templates, in addition to a consensus document. Such data sheets would be constructed in such a way to allow scientists who might not be expert in one field to nevertheless collect and analyze data that would be of importance to scientists in another field. With respect to data archiving and retrieval, the discussion revolved in large part around databases, what is currently available, their use, and development of common standards for submission and data format.",

            "abstract": "The northeastern Brooks Range of northern Alaska is an active, north-directed fold-and-thrust belt that is advancing on the Barrow Arch and the north-facing passive margin of the Arctic Basin. Density logs, leak-off tests and mud profiles from 57 wells from the northeastern North Slope were used to determine the magnitude of the present-day in situ stresses and document significant regional lateral and vertical variations in relative stress magnitude.\nPreliminary analysis indicate two distinct stress regimes across this region of Alaska. Areas adjacent to the eastern Barrow Arch exhibit both strike-slip (Shmax > Sv > Shmin) and normal stress regimes (Sv >Shmax >Shmin). This in situ stress regime is consistent with observed fault patterns in the subsurface and with north-south extension along the Barrow Arch and the north Alaska margin.\nTo the south in and near the northeastern Brooks Range thrust front, in situ stress magnitudes indicate an active thrust fault regime (Shmax > Shmin > Sv) is present at depths up to 6000 ft. This is consistent with the fold and thrust structures observed in surface exposures and in the subsurface. However, at depths greater than 6000 ft, the relative in situ stress magnitudes indicate a change to a strike slip regime. This observation is consistent with the few earthquake focal mechanisms in the area and suggests deep north-northeast oriented strike slip faults may underlie the western margin of the northeastern Brooks Range.",

            "abstract": "The water vapor content in the atmosphere has risen significantly over the past half century and global hydrological cycle has been intensified accordingly. The anthropogenic warming changed not only the mean state of precipitation but also the occurrence of extreme precipitation. The basic science connecting human-induced climate change to more frequent extreme precipitation is relative evident. It is far more challenging to predict how climate change will affect the magnitude and frequency of these events at the relatively fine spatial scales, which is strongly depend on the capability of the regional climate model (RCM).\n8-km high-resolution regional climate model simulations from the RiskChange model assessment project were analyzed for changes in extreme precipitation over North Europe. Four regional model simulations were carried out from two RCMs cross-forced by two different GCMs separately. Indices of extreme precipitation included monthly maxima and maximum consecutive 5 days total precipitation. Generalized extreme value (GEV) theory was used to model tail distribution of extreme precipitation. These model results were compared with EOBS observations and intense Denmark station observations of these extremes for the reference period of 1981-2010.\nDifferences in four cross-forced RCM simulations were analyzed to investigate the capability of high-resolution RCM on simulated extreme precipitation. We are addressing three questions. One, are the GEV parameters of model-simulated heavy rain similar to observed extreme precipitation. Two, how much is model uncertainty came from inter-model variation. Three, can weighted model result perform better skill than individual RCM simulations.",

            "abstract": "Fires in wetlands can move into organic soils, where the resulting ground fires can smolder and consume large amounts of soil. These long-duration fires have a number of negative effects including air quality and motorist safety, as well as large-scale implications resulting from their release of large quantities of stored carbon. However, the ecological implications of the frequency and intensity of organic soil combustion occurrence are relatively unexplored. Smoldering fires in organic soils may increase local hydroperiod and wetland storage by lowering elevation, conferring benefits to wildlife (e.g., dry season refugia and feeding grounds). Short-term increases in productivity due to nutrient availability from ash may occur in or adjacent to areas affected by ground fires. Short-term negative feedbacks to fire return period are also likely to occur locally, due to increased hydroperiods; however, adjacent uplands may experience hydrologic changes as well, including factors which may affect fire risk far from areas of organic soil consumption. To explore hydrologic implications of soil-consuming ground fires, we developed a model based on a low-relief region in southern Florida (U.S.A.) that is characterized by seasonal hydrologic fluctuations and areas of organic soil distributed across a landscape that experiences frequent fire (i.e., 2-4 year return interval in uplands adjacent to wetlands). Parameterizing the model with local soil and hydrologic properties, as well as observed effects of fire in the region’s organic soils, the model predicts changes to wetland depths, bathymetry, and storage competence as a function of fire severity (i.e., area and depth of burn) that may be ecologically significant. Our findings imply that soil-consuming ground fires—and their prevention—have ecohydrological implications that must be considered when developing ecosystem and fire management protocols.",

            "abstract": "The photosynthetic uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) by tidal salt marshes results in the long-term storage of carbon in the sediment. In recent decades, pressures such as land-use change and sea level rise have significantly reduced the global extent of salt marshes and increased the need for restoration projects. Restored salt marshes have been shown to provide many of the same ecological and economic benefits as natural marshes, including fish habitat, pollution filtration, and shoreline stabilization. Given the high carbon sequestration capacity of tidal marshes, carbon storage is likely an additional benefit of restoration; however, the degree to which restored marshes achieve equivalency with natural marshes in terms of carbon burial has not been well-defined. In this study, annual carbon sequestration rates in transplanted marshes were estimated and belowground carbon stocks were compared in transplanted versus natural marshes. Sediment cores were collected from five transplanted Spartina alterniflora marshes of known age (12-38 years old) in the Newport River Estuary, NC and from two natural marshes of unknown age. Organic matter content was estimated using the loss on ignition method and carbon content was estimated based on previously established relationships. In transplanted marshes, the rate of carbon sequestration in the top 30 cm decreased with marsh age and ranged from 76.70 g C/m2/yr (38 year old marsh) to 212.83 g C/m2/yr (12 year old marsh). The natural marshes contained significantly larger carbon stocks in the top 30 cm (4534.61 – 7790.18 g C m-2) than the transplanted marshes (1822.97 – 3798.62 g C m-2). However, the annual sequestration rates in the transplanted marshes are similar to those observed by others in natural marshes, and therefore it is likely that over time restored marshes are capable of accreting belowground carbon stocks equivalent to those found in natural marshes.",

These couplings show rapid particle acceleration over a broad longitudinal extent (∼ 80 degrees) resulting from the pile-up of magnetic flux in the compression regions and their subsequent expansion. The challenge for forming large SEP events in such compression-acceleration scenarios is to have enhanced scattering within the acceleration region while also allowing for efficient escape of accelerated particles downstream (away from the Sun) from the compression region. We present here the most recent simulation results including energetic particle and CME plasma profiles, the subsequent flux and dosages at 1AU, and an analysis of the compressional regions as efficient accelerators.",

            "abstract": "The problem of developing mobile oceanographic and atmospheric observation networks (MOAO) with coordinated air and ocean vehicles is discussed in the framework of the communications and control software tool chain developed at Underwater Systems and Technologies Laboratory (LSTS) from Porto University. This is done with reference to field experiments to illustrate key capabilities and to assess future MOAO operations. First, the motivation for building MOAO by “composition” of air and ocean vehicles, communication networks, and planning and execution control frameworks is discussed – in networked vehicle systems information and commands are exchanged among multiple vehicles and operators, and the roles, relative positions, and dependencies of these vehicles and operators change during operations. Second, the planning and execution control framework developed at LSTS for multi-vehicle systems is discussed with reference to key concepts such as autonomy, mixed-initiative interactions, and layered organization. Third, the LSTS tool software tool chain is presented to show how to develop MOAO by composition. The tool chain comprises the Neptus command and control framework for mixed initiative interactions, the underlying IMC messaging protocol, and the DUNE on-board software. Fourth, selected LSTS operational deployments illustrate MOAO capability building. In 2012 we demonstrated the use of UAS to “ferry” data from UUVs located beyond line of sight (BLOS). In 2013 we demonstrated coordinated observations of coastal fronts with small UAS and UUVs, “bent” BLOS through the use of UAS as communication relays, and UAS tracking of juvenile hammer-head sharks. In 2014 we demonstrated UUV adaptive sampling with the closed loop controller of the UUV residing on a UAS; this was done with the help of a Wave Glider ASV with a communications gateway. The results from these experiments provide a background for assessing potential future UAS operations in a compositional MOAO.",

            "abstract": "This study presents a sensitivity analysis of the impact of sub-annual fossil fuel CO2 emissions on simulated CO2 concentration using a global tracer transport model. Four sensitivity experiments were conducted to investigate the impact of three cyclic components (diurnal, weekly and monthly) and a complete cyclic component (the combination of the three) by comparing with a temporally “flat” fossil fuel CO2 emissions inventory. A complete exploration of these impacts is quantified at annual, seasonal, weekly and diurnal time scales of the CO2concentration for the surface, vertical profile and column-integral structure.\nResult shows an annual mean surface concentration difference varying from -1.35 ppm to 0.13 ppm at grid scale for the complete cyclic fossil fuel emissions, which is mainly driven by a large negative diurnal rectification and less positive seasonal rectification. The negative diurnal rectification is up to 1.45 ppm at grid scale and primarily due to the covariation of diurnal fossil fuel CO2 emissions and diurnal variations of vertical mixing. The positive seasonal rectification is up to 0.23 ppm at grid scale which is mainly driven by the monthly fossil fuel CO2emissions coupling with atmospheric transport. Both the diurnal and seasonal rectifier effects are indicated at local-to-regional scales with center at large source regions and extend to neighboring regions in mainly Northern Hemisphere.\nThe diurnal fossil fuel CO2 emissions is found to significantly affect the simulated diurnal CO2 amplitude (up to 9.12 ppm at grid scale), which is primarily contributed by the minima concentration differences around local sunset time. Similarly, large impact on the seasonal CO2 amplitude (up to 6.11 ppm) is found at regional scale for the monthly fossil fuel emissions. An impact of diurnal fossil fuel CO2 emissions on simulated afternoon CO2 concentration is also identified by up to 1.13 ppm at local scales. The study demonstrates a large cyclic fossil fuel CO2 emissions impact on simulated CO2 concentration, and suggests that attempts to constrain carbon fluxes using surface measurements and inversion models can be improved by avoiding the biases caused by considering the temporal variations in fossil fuel CO2 emissions.",

An essential step in understanding the performance and the science return of current and future sounding experiments is an accurate understanding of the dielectric properties of comets and how they translate to the different physical, chemical and structural hypotheses of these bodies. To help constrain the ambiguities associated with this wide parametric space, we build eight parametric 3D dielectric models of the comet nucleus representing different structural and physical formation hypotheses, and we simulated the propagation of radar waves through each nucleus model using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. We extrapolated the shape model from the first Rosetta Navigation Camera images, while the different internal structures of each model are representative of existing theories of comet nuclei structures. The complex dielectric constants used in our models have been generated using mixing laws for a porous mixture of ice and meteoritic dust. Our simulations were performed at a lower frequency with respect to the central frequency of the CONSERT instrument due to computational memory limitations. The lower resolution obtained will still provide a sufficient and close approximation of the final experiment, given that the dielectric properties of the nucleus’ materials are non-dispersive. Our results suggest that each model of the comet nucleus’ interior structure produces a different radar signature in both the transmitted and reflected signals. In particular we note that scattering from inner-structure complexity compromises the visibility of the comet backside. Our simulation suggests that we can discern the different formation hypotheses with their associated internal structures for Comet 67P using the CONSERT experiment. Our results will support the CONSERT data interpretations to determine whether Comet 67P was generated by the aggregation of icy rubble, whether it presents a layered inner structure, and also whether it is a two-body system.",

However, snowfall retrieval from satellite observations is very difficult (compared to rainfall retrieval) because of several reasons including weak radiative signal, surface contamination, cloud liquid water masking, etc. Several satellite sensors currently in operation are potentially capable of detecting and estimating snowfall, for example, cloud radar onboard CloudSat and high frequency microwave radiometers (SSMIS, MHS, GMI) on NOAA, MetOP, S-NPP, DMSP and GPM satellites. In this paper, we report our research results on how to best use these sensors to extract snowfall information. Specifically, we (1) studied the global snowfall frequency and rate distributions based on multiple years of CloudSat observations; (2) investigated the optimal channel selection for snowfall retrieval using collocated satellite SSMIS (19-183 GHz) and ground radar (NMQ) data; (3) developed a retrieval algorithm in which radar data (CloudSat and/or NMQ) are used as truth to train high-frequency passive microwave data and use high-frequency passive microwave data to broaden spatial and temporal coverage. Finally, retrievals based on observations from several satellites are compared with each other and compared with surface observations.",

            "abstract": "Understanding and quantifying the response of marine organisms to present and future ocean acidification remains a major challenge encompassing observations on single species in culture and scaling up to the ecosystem and global scale. Understanding calcification changes in culture experiments designed to simulate present and future ocean conditions under potential CO2 emissions scenarios, and especially detecting the likely more subtle changes that may occur prior to the onset of more extreme ocean acidification, depends on the tools available. Here we explore the utility of high-resolution computed tomography (nano-CT) to provide quantitative biometric data on field collected and cultured marine pteropods, using the General Electric Company Phoenix Nanotom S Instrument. The technique is capable of quantitating the whole shell of the organism, allowing shell dimensions to be determined as well as parameters such as average shell thickness, the variation in thickness across the whole shell and in localized areas, total shell volume and surface area and when combined with weight measurements shell density can be calculated. The potential power of the technique is the ability to derive these parameters even on very small organisms less than 1 millimeter in size. Tuning the X-ray strength of the instrument allows organic material to be excluded from the analysis. Through replicate analysis of standards, we assess the reproducibility of data, and by comparison with dimension measurements derived from light microscopy we assess the accuracy of dimension determinations. We present results from historical and modern pteropod populations from the Mediterranean and cultured polar pteropods, resolving statistically significant differences in shell biometrics in both cases that may represent responses to ocean acidification.",

            "abstract": "A challenge facing STEM graduate students is the daunting task of communicating their research to a non-specialist audience. Strategies that work well in lab group meetings, such as using acronyms and jargon, do not work in the real world. Ideally, scientists should directly connect with any audience, responding spontaneously and actively, distilling their messages into conversational morsels that resonate with that audience. Scientists should listen.\nThis presentation highlights a 10-week, interdisciplinary graduate course at Dartmouth College that teaches methods for communicating science with clarity, vividness, and emotion. The course was developed in partnership with Stony Brook University’s Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science, and emphasizes story-telling, two-way communication, active listening, and so much more. Effective message development and communication skills – spontaneity, authenticity, and connectivity – are honed through improvisational theater exercises.\nOne might ask, “why improv?” As a co-developer/co-instructor of this graduate course and a Ph.D. candidate in Earth Sciences, my response is, “why not improv?” Improv is acting without a script. It is also underground rap battles, baking from scratch, and playing jazz flute. Improv is Macguyver. Improv is not any one particular thing so much as it is a process through which we do things. Improv can teach us a lot: how to play, how to feel comfortable and present even while flailing, and how to truly listen.",

The DEMs are constructed with the fully-automated Surface Extraction from TIN-based Search Minimization (SETSM) software developed by Ohio State University specifically for DEM extraction over high latitude terrains. The SETSM algorithm features an iterative process for correcting biases in the imagery geolocation information, improving DEM success over low-contrast and repetitively-textured surfaces such as snow and mountain shadows. The imagery are orthorectified using the corresponding DEM and individual orthoimages and DEMs are mosaiced into continuous tiles of coverage. To facilitate change detection, each pixel contains an acquisition date stamp and a flag indicating if the DEM pixel was measured or interpolated. The data are openly available online with registration at\nhttp://www.pgc.umn.edu/elevation/stereo\n.\nHere we present the Greenland DEM and orthoimage mosaics with examples of applications and comparisons to existing datasets. We compare the DEM’s to coincident laser altimeter measurements to examine accuracies and potential biases, as well as discuss the feasibility of merging the DEMs with coordinated laser altimeter surveys to improve the spatial coverage of high-precision elevation data.",

            "abstract": "Ecosystem models such AgroIBIS require detailed parameterizations of numerous vegetation traits related to leaf structure, biochemistry and photosynthetic capacity to properly assess plant carbon assimilation and yield response to environmental variability. In general, these traits are estimated from a limited number of field measurements or sourced from the literature, but rarely is the full observed range of variability in these traits utilized in modeling activities. In addition, pathogens and pests, such as the exotic soybean aphid (Aphis glycines), which affects photosynthetic pathways in soybean plants by feeding on phloem and sap, can potentially impact plant productivity and yields. Capturing plant responses to pest pressure in conjunction with environmental variability is of considerable interest to managers and the scientific community alike. In this research, we employed full-range (400-2500 nm) field and laboratory spectroscopy to rapidly characterize the leaf biochemical and physiological traits, namely foliar nitrogen, specific leaf area (SLA) and the maximum rate of RuBP carboxylation by the enzyme RuBisCo (Vcmax) in soybean plants, which experienced a broad range of environmental conditions and soybean aphid pressures. We utilized near-surface spectroscopic remote sensing measurements as a means to capture the spatial and temporal patterns of aphid impacts across broad aphid pressure levels. In addition, we used the spectroscopic data to generate a much larger dataset of key model parameters required by AgroIBIS than would be possible through traditional measurements of biochemistry and leaf-level gas exchange. The use of spectroscopic retrievals of soybean traits allowed us to better characterize the variability of plant responses associated with aphid pressure to more accurately model the likely impacts of soybean aphid on soybeans. Our next steps include the coupling of the information derived from our spectral measurements with the AgroIBIS model to project the impacts of increasing aphid pressures on yields expected with continued global change and altered environmental conditions.",

            "abstract": "Long-runout (> 50 km) subaerial landslides are rare on Earth, but are common features episodically shaping Mars' Valles Marineris (VM) trough system over the past 3.5 billion years. They display two end-member morphologies: a thick-skinned inner zone, characterized by fault-bounded, rotated blocks near their source region, and a thin-skinned, exceptionally long-runout outer zone, characterized by thin sheets spreading over 10s of km across the trough floor. Four decades of studies on the latter have resulted in two main competing hypotheses to explain their long-distance transport: (1) movement of landslides over layers of trapped air or soft materials containing ice or snow, enabling basal lubrication, and (2) fluidization of landslide materials with or without the presence of water and volatiles. To address this issue, we examine the mineralogic composition of landslides across VM using Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) near-infrared spectral data analysis coupled with detailed geologic mapping and morphometric analysis of satellite images. Our survey reveals a general correlation between transport distance, significant lateral spreading, and the presence of hydrated silicates among VM landslides. Given that smectite clay absorbs water into its layered crystal structure and can reduce the friction coefficient by a factor of three v. that of dry rocks, these results suggest that hydrated silicates played a decisive role in facilitating long-runout landslide transport in VM. We propose that, concurrent with downslope failure and sliding of broken trough-wall rock, frontal landslide masses overrode and entrained hydrated-silicate-bearing trough-floor deposits, lubricating the basal sliding zones and permitting the landslide outer zones to spread laterally while moving forward over the low-friction surface. The key participation of hydrated silicates in episodic, sustained landslide activity throughout the canyon implies that clay minerals, generated by water-rock interactions in the Noachian and Hesperian (4.1- 3.3 Ga), exert a long-lasting influence on geomorphic processes that shape the surface of the planet.",

            "abstract": "It is well established that groundwater pumping affects surface-water availability by intercepting groundwater that would otherwise discharge to streams and/or by increasing seepage from surface-water channels. Conversely, surface-water management operations effect groundwater availability by altering the timing, location, and quantity of groundwater recharge and demand. Successful conjunctive use may require analysis with an integrated approach that accounts for the many interactions and feedbacks between surface-water and groundwater availability and their joint management.\nIn order to improve simulation and analysis of conjunctive use, Bureau of Reclamation and USGS are collaborating to develop a surface-water operations module within MODFLOW One Water Hydrologic Flow Model (MF-OWHM), a new version of the USGS Modular Groundwater Flow Model (MODFLOW). Here we describe the development and application of the surface-water operations module. We provide an overview of the conceptual approach used to simulate surface-water operations—including surface-water storage, allocation, release, diversion, and delivery on monthly to seasonal time frames—in a fully-integrated manner. We then present results from a recent case study analysis of the Rio Grande Project, a large-scale irrigation project located in New Mexico and Texas, under varying surface-water operations criteria and climate conditions. Case study results demonstrate the importance of integrated hydrologic simulation of surface water and groundwater operations in analysis and management of conjunctive-use systems.",

The MicroMAS flight unit was developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory and the MIT Space Systems\nLaboratory and was launched to the International Space Station on July 13, 2014, and scheduled for an early\nSeptember deployment for a ~90-day mission. The payload is housed in the “lower” 1U of the dual-spinning 3U\nCubeSat and mechanically rotated approximately once per second as the spacecraft orbits the Earth, resulting in a\ncross-track scanned beam with a full-width half-max (FWHM) beamwidth of 2.4 degrees and an approximately 17-\nkm diameter footprint at nadir incidence from a nominal altitude of 400 km. The relatively low cost of MicroMAS\nenables the deployment of a constellation of sensors, spaced equally around several orbit planes. A small fleet of\nMicroMAS systems could yield high-resolution global temperature and water vapor profiles, as well as cloud\nmicrophysical and precipitation parameters.\nSignificant advancements were made in the Assembly, Integration, and Test phase of the project development\nlifecycle. The flight software and communications architecture was refined and tested in relevant lab facilities. The\npower subsystem was modified to include additional required inhibits for the ISS launch. Hardware in the loop tests\nas well as simulations of the attitude determination and control system (ADCS) were performed to validate the\nunique dual-spinning, local vertical, local horizontal (LVLH) stabilized flight design. ADCS algorithms were tested\non a 3-axis air bearing and custom rig inside a 3-axis programmable Helmholtz cage. Finally, the integrated\nspacecraft underwent a series of environmental tests in order to verify the results of thermal modeling analyses,\nprove the performance of critical design components in relevant environmental conditions, and validate the software\nand concept-of-operations developed for flight. We present these advancements, lessons-learned in developing a\nscience-oriented CubeSat system, and any available launch/on-orbit updates.",

            "abstract": "Expanding sugarcane production on the 65.9 mha area identified by Brazilian government can provide a sustainable and low carbon intensive supply of liquid fuel to the world. However, such expansion is also subject to long-term climate changes. Variation in sugarcane yield at policy-relevant spatial and temporal scales can greatly influence the long-term potential of Brazilian. A process-based crop model (BioCro) is parameterized and calibrated for leaf photosynthesis and field productivity. Multi-site validation against observed stem yield of sugarcane cultivar RB72454 suggests that model can predict consistent yield (observed = 0.92 × predicted; R2 = 0.65) over a wide range of soil and environmental conditions in Brazil. Regional simulations based on national soil data and reanalysis climate data suggest that 1.938 petagram (Pg) of stem dry biomass can be harvested annually. Increasing temperature and [CO2] can partially compensate for yield decline due to reduced rainfall in future, by means of greater water use efficiency and rate of photosynthesis. Simulations using five GCMs climate data suggest that average productivity of harvested stem dry biomass may decline from 1.938 Pg year-1 to 1.544 Pg year-1 (1.243-2.066 Pg year-1) by 2045 in the absence of improved cultivars.",

            "abstract": "Land clearing detection and woody Foliage Projective Cover (FPC) monitoring at the state and national level in Australia has mainly been undertaken by state governments and the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) because of the considerable expense, expertise, sustained duration of activities and staffing levels needed. Only recently have services become available, providing low budget, generalized access to change detection tools suited to this task. The objective of this research was to examine if a globally available service, Google Earth Engine Beta, could be used to predict woody vegetation loss with accuracies approaching the methods used by TERN and the government of the state of Queensland, Australia. Two change detection approaches were investigated using Landsat Thematic Mapper time series and the Google Earth Engine Application Programming Interface: (1) CART and Random Forest classifiers; and (2) a normalized time series of Foliage Projective Cover (FPC) and NDVI combined with a spectral index. The CART and Random Forest classifiers produced high user’s and producer’s mapping accuracies of clearing (77-92% and 54-77%, respectively) when detecting change within epochs for which training data were available, but extrapolation to epochs without training data reduced the mapping accuracies. The use of FPC and NDVI time series provided a more robust approach for calculation of a clearing probability, as it did not rely on training data but instead on the difference of the normalized FPC / NDVI mean and standard deviation of a single year at the change point in relation to the remaining time series. However, the FPC and NDVI time series approach represented a trade-off between user’s and producer’s accuracies. Both change detection approaches explored in this research were sensitive to ephemeral greening and drying of the landscape. However, the developed normalized FPC and NDVI time series approach can be tuned to provide automated alerts for large woody vegetation clearing events by selecting suitable thresholds to identify very likely clearing. This research provides a comprehensive foundation to build further capacity to use globally accessible, free, online image datasets and processing tools to accurately detect woody vegetation clearing in an automated and rapid manner.",

            "abstract": "Mangroves have the highest carbon stocks amongst tropical forests. In Mexico, however, little is known about their potential to mitigate climate change. In this work, we estimated biomass carbon stocks in the Southern Mexican Pacific Coast (~69,000 ha). We quantified above and belowground biomass carbon stocks at (1) the regional scale along two environmental strata (i.e. dry and wet), and (2) at the local scale along three geomorphological types of mangroves (i.e. fringe, estuarine and basin). Regional strata were defined using intensity and influence of rivers and, the mean annual precipitation and evapotranspiration ratio (i.e., wet < 1 > dry). By lowering the stressing environmental conditions (e.g., low salinity and high sediment accumulation), we expected the highest stocks in mangroves growing in wet and estuarine strata at the regional scale and local scale, respectively. Quantifications were carried out in sixty-six sites chosen through stratified randomized design in which six strata were obtained by a full combination of regional and local strata. In all strata, aboveground carbon represents 64-67% of total carbon. Total biomass carbon was higher in wet than dry stratum (W: 87.3 ± 6.9, D: 47.0 ± 5.0, p<0.001). While at local scale, total biomass carbon was high in estuarine mangroves of both wet and dry regions (W: 91.6 ± 7.8, D: 77.6 ± 14.8, p<0.001), and these were statistically similar to fringe wet mangroves (110.9 ± 24.2, p<0.001), the stratum with the highest total carbon. Following a conservative approach, the Mexican Southern Pacific Coast is storing near 20,344 Gg CO2e. If the historical annual deforestation rate of 0.54% continues, this region could emit between 0.03 and 14.4 Gg of CO2e ha/year, out of which wet estuarine mangroves would have the highest emission values. Evidence suggests that these mangroves are the most important strata in which REDD+ mechanisms could be implemented due to (1) their carbon stocks, and (2) their highest deforestation threat in the region as a result of commercial agriculture. Strategies for conservation and enhancement of carbon stocks in these mangroves require strengthened links between carbon and economic benefits that ecosystems provide.",

            "abstract": "This is the culmination of a 6-year effort to create a seamless multi-sensor data record about vegetation dynamic from different synoptic imagers. In this work we devised a set of sophisticated science algorithms to combine these disparate data records into an unique and single dataset. To address the cross sensor continuity problem, several published methods were tested. These methods ranged from a single global linear transfer equation (V1), to a land cover based approach (V2, V3), and to a complex hybrid method that looks at the behavior of each pixel separately and considers the impact of vegetation seasonality by adjusting the continuity by the vegetation dynamic of each phase of the growing season (V4). Because of the 1999 break between AVHRR and MODIS we considered SPOT-VGT data in bridging the two sensors using the periods of overlap. However, we found that due to the lack of an efficient cloud algorithm and accurate QA data in SPOT-VGT the method performed rather poorly. In V4 we matched the AVHRR and MODIS medium term average single pixel temporal profile and created spatially explicit transfer equations. This approach was far superior to all other methods and was adopted in our V4 reprocessing effort.\nFurthermore, the issue of data filtering was found to be critical to the overall approach. The stricter the data filtering the better the performance of the continuity algorithm. Filtering lead to spatial gaps that were addressed using a simple linear interpolation algorithm, in case of long temporal gaps we used a long term average substitution technique. All data were assigned per pixel quality information that captured the input quality and processing performance.\nThis filtering, continuity, and gap filling package was applied to a 30+ year record of daily global observations from the LTDR-V4 AVHRR (1981-1999) and MODIS C5 (2000-2013) to generate records of NDVI, EVI2, and phenology metrics at CMG resolution. Version V4 of these records are available at daily, 7day, 15day, and monthly steps. The Phenology metrics are available at 1 and 3-year cycles. Additional long term average reference data of these records are available at 5, 10, 20 and full record through an interactive “Data Explorer” visualization system [http://vip.arizona.edu/viplab_data_explorer] and separately through the LP DAAC.",

            "abstract": "The Trotternish Peninsula, Isle of Skye, has experienced Late Glacial and on-going slope instability. The area of landsliding extends over an area of 45 km by 6.5 km along the eastern side of the peninsula making this one of the largest landslide complexes in Europe. A series of Tertiary lava flows and concordant intrusions resting on and within a sequence of Upper Jurassic marine sediments form a west-tilted plateau. The eastern scarp face has failed as a series of interlinked failure blocks. Previous investigations have interpreted the mode of failure as progressive rotation, with the slip plane located at the contact between the Upper Jurassic sediments and the transgressive Little Minch Sill. The driver for failure is gravitational collapse. The eastern coast of Skye was subject to extensive glacial erosion during the Late Devensian leading to (possibly structurally-controlled) over-deepening of the Inner Sound between the island and the Scottish Mainland. The decay of the ice mass at the end of the last glaciation left an area of over-steepened slopes along the east coast of Skye and the neighbouring island of Raasay.  Geomorphological and structural mapping has identified a more complex mode of failure than previously recognised, involving rotation, toppling, planar sliding, rockfalls, mudflows and ‘sackung-like’ gravitational spreading. The boundaries between adjacent landslide blocks and the zones of different modes of failure areoften demarked by pre-existing structure, including fault zones, dyke intrusions and major joint sets. The basalslip plane, at least in part, appears to have reactivated syn-depositional listric faults within the Jurassic marine sequence. Overall, the landslide complex can be simplified into: an inner zone of postglacial failure close to the present-day headscarp, where toppling, translation and minor rotation are the predominant failure mechanisms; a glacially smoothed transition zone where the exact mode of failure are yet to clearly determined; and an outer zone along the shoreline of the peninsula where the failure is reactivated movement of Late Glacial rotated blocks in Jurassic mudstones that are now subject to erosion, toppling and extensive mudflows.",

            "abstract": "Las Vegas, Nevada, with 2 million residents and 40 million annual visitors, is one of the driest metropolitan environments of its size in the world. The metro imports nearly all of its resources, including energy, water and food. Rapid population increases, drought, and temperature increases due to climate change create challenges for planning resilient systems in the Las Vegas Valley.\nBecause of its growth rate, aridity, Las Vegas, Nevada is a significant and relevant region for the study of the water, energy, food and climate nexus. Cities in the United States and the world are seeing increasing trends in urbanization and water scarcity. How does the water-energy-climate-food nexus affect each metropolitan area? How can this complex information be used for resiliency planning? How can it be related to the public, so they can understand the issues in a way that makes them meaningful participants in the planning process?\nThe topic of our presentation is a ‘resiliency atlas.’ The atlas is a place-based model tested in Las Vegas to explore bioregional distinctiveness of the water-energy-climate-food nexus, including regional transportation systems. The atlas integrates the systems within a utilitarian organization of information. Systems in this place-based model demonstrate how infrastructure services are efficiently provided for the Las Vegas Valley population.\nThis resiliency atlas can clarify how the nexus applies to place; and how it can be used to spur geographically germane adaption strategies. In the Las Vegas Valley, climate change (drought and high sustained temperatures) and population affect water, energy, and food systems. This clarity of a place based model can help educate the public about the resilience of their place, and facilitate and organize the planning process in the face of uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "The groundwater community has widely recognized the model structure uncertainty as the major source of model uncertainty in groundwater modeling. Previous studies in the aquifer remediation design, however, rarely discuss the impact of the model structure uncertainty. This study combines the chance-constrained (CC) programming with the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) as a BMA-CC framework to assess the effect of model structure uncertainty in the remediation design. To investigate the impact of the model structure uncertainty on the remediation design, we compare the BMA-CC method with the traditional CC programming that only considers the model parameter uncertainty. The BMA-CC method is employed to design a hydraulic barrier to protect public supply wells of the Government St. pump station from saltwater intrusion in the “1,500-foot” sand and the “1-700-foot” sand of the Baton Rouge area, southeastern Louisiana. To address the model structure uncertainty, we develop three conceptual groundwater models based on three different hydrostratigraphy structures. The results show that using the traditional CC programming overestimates design reliability. The results also show that at least five additional connector wells are needed to achieve more than 90% design reliability level. The total amount of injected water from connector wells is higher than the total pumpage of the protected public supply wells. While reducing injection rate can be achieved by reducing reliability level, the study finds that the hydraulic barrier design to protect the Government St. pump station is not economically attractive.",

            "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage is a climate change mitigation technology with the potential to serve as a bridge technology as society transitions from a fossil fuel dependent energy system to a renewable energy dominated system. One of the greatest concerns associated with wide-scale adoption of carbon capture and storage technology is the risk of carbon dioxide leakage from sequestration reservoirs. Thus there is a need to develop efficient and effective strategies for monitoring and verification of geologically stored carbon dioxide. To evaluate the potential for estimating leakage fluxes based on mobile surveys, we establish correlations between concentration data and flux measurements made with a flux chamber. These correlations are then used to estimate leakage fluxes over a 70-meter long horizontal well buried approximately 1.8 meters below the surface at the Zero Emissions Research and Technology (ZERT) facility operated by Montana State University. The CO2 had a leakage rate of 0.15 t/d, which is comparable to a small leak in an industrial scale project (0.005% of a 1 Mt/yr storage project). A Picarro gas analyzer was used to measure 12CO2 and 13CO2 at heights of 3 cm above the ground surface. Previous studies (Moriarty, 2014) show that concentration data at this height provides a very high likelihood (>95%) of detecting leaks within a distance of 2.5 m of the leak. Measured concentration data show a noisy but significant correlation with flux measurements, thus providing the possibility to obtain rough estimates of leakage fluxes from mobile measurements.\nMoriarty, Dylan, 2014.

            "abstract": "The Earth’s lower thermosphere is an important interface region between the neutral atmosphere and the “space weather” environment. While the high-latitude region of the thermosphere responds promptly to energy inputs, relatively little is known about the global/regional response to these energy inputs. Global temperatures are predicted to respond within 3-6 hours, but the details of the thermal response of the atmosphere as energy transports away from high-latitude source regions is not well understood. The Optical Profiling of the Atmospheric Limb (OPAL) mission aims to characterize this thermal response through observation of the temperature structure of the lower thermosphere at mid- and low-latitudes.\nThe OPAL instrument is designed to map global thermospheric temperature variability over the critical “thermospheric gap” region (~100-140 km altitude) by spectroscopic analysis of molecular oxygen A-band emission (758 – 768 nm). The OPAL instrument is a grating-based imaging spectrometer with refractive optics and a high-efficiency volume holographic grating (VHG). The scene is sampled by 7 parallel slits that form non-overlapping spectral profiles at the focal plane with resolution of 0.5 nm (spectral), 1.5 km (limb profiling), and 60 km (horizontal sampling). A CCD camera at the instrument focal plane delivers low noise and high sensitivity. The instrument is designed to strongly reject stray light from daylight regions of the earth.\nThe OPAL mission is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) CubeSat-based Science Missions for Geospace and Atmospheric Research program. The OPAL instrument and mission will be designed, built and executed by a team comprised of students and professors from Utah State University, Dixie State University and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, with support from professional scientists and engineers from the Space Dynamics Laboratory and Hawk Institute for Space Science.",

To fully understand the potential and limitation of the NCEP Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) in predicting seasonal drought in China, this study investigated how the seasonal drought predictive skill varies with such multiple factors in China. Six-month standardized precipitation index (SPI6) is used as the primary drought indicator to measure the medium-term meteorological drought. The predictive skill was then assessed by the correlation coefficient between observation-based SPI6 and CFSv2 forecast-based SPI6 at multiple spatial scales as well as multiple lead times during the period 1982-2008. Through this analysis, we will better characterize the capability of CFSv2 in seasonal climate forecast, which can help us to better utilize forecast information from such a system in drought prediction and water resource management.",

            "abstract": "The equatorial Indian Ocean is characterized by strong eastward surface flows in boreal spring and fall referred to as the Wyrtki jets. These jets are driven by westerly winds during the transition seasons between the Southwest and Northeast Monsoons and represent a major conduit for mass, heat, and salt transfer between the eastern and western sides of the basin. Since their discovery over 40 years ago, there have been very few estimates from direct observations of the volume transports associated with these currents. In this presentation we will describe seasonal to interannual time scale variations in volume transport based on four years of unique measurements from a meridional array of acoustic Doppler current profilers along 80°5E in the center of the basin. The relation of these transports to zonal wind stress forcing, sea surface height variations and sea surface temperature variations in association with the Indian Ocean Dipole will be highlighted. We will also illustrate the role of wind-forced equatorial waves in affecting transport variations.",

            "abstract": "Because of the dominant influence of surface solar heating on atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) flows, the character and even underlying theories of turbulence vary diurnally over the continents. While great strides have been made in our understanding of the stable boundary layers that prevail overnight, the period of transition from a convective daytime to a stable nighttime ABL remains a very challenging problem in no small part because of its inherently non-stationary nature and because both of the main forcings, wind stress and surface heat flux, tend to flag at this time of day. These underexplored topics motivated the Boundary Layer Late Afternoon and Sunset Turbulence (BLLAST) field experiment held in the summer of 2011 at the CNRS Laboratorie d'Aerologie in Campistrous, France. On three of the twelve intensive observational days of the experiment, three rawinsondes were launched simultaneously approximately 3 km apart throughout the afternoon transition in order to directly measure mesoscale horizontal divergence in the ABL and lower free troposphere. Using the assumption of incompressibility, the observed divergence is integrated and a vertical profile of mean vertical wind is derived for the lower troposphere. Although the magnitude of the inferred vertical winds are much larger than expected (of order 0.1 ms-1), the measurements do indicate a clear trend in afternoon subsidence giving way to evening uplift at the site, which is within ~10 km of the Pyrenees' foothills. The observed transition from low-level divergence to convergence was accompanied by a deep surface pressure minimum that fluctuated by nearly 300 Pa diurnally, and we propose that it is likely related to the reversal of the plain-mountain circulation across the region. The impact of such behavior on boundary layer growth and entrainment during the afternoon hours are discussed along with evidence of similar behavior observed elsewhere in mountainous terrain.",

            "abstract": "The opposing feedbacks to climate warming by surface albedo (positive) and carbon storage (negative) of forests, partly explains the recent interest in understanding what controls the extent of forests while the need to understand visual patterns has long stimulated questions and studies. Studies into the reasons for limits to forest extent have generally focused on the transition zone (treeline) between the forest and the adjacent shrub, heath, or meadow. There, the questions have focused on two main themes, one relating to the small size of the tree individuals (growth) and the other to their low density (reproduction and establishment). The questions thus boil down to: Why so small?” “Why so few?” The assumption is that good answers will explain the location of the treeline.\nI will address some weaknesses in our framing of the questions relating to treelines and in our approaches in answering them. What are the major knowledge gaps and what are some ways to make future research efforts more effective? These may include the identification of categories of treeline types and their distribution over short and long distances i.e. the need for both intensive and extensive sites within and between mountain ranges. They may also include preliminary assessment of the temporal and spatial data resolutions needed for generalizations. Both biotic and abiotic resources and stressors must be recognized, both in terms of direct physical (e.g. shelter, shade) and chemical impacts (e.g. litter quality, toxic release) and the former also in terms of their indirect impact where they serve as alternative hosts of a symbiont or a pathogen. I will point out that implicit assumptions of relevance of a factor and the tree response patterns may be faulty and give examples of the unintended consequences of some techniques designed to manipulate resource availability. To successfully address these shortcomings, I will discuss the benefits of multi-/inter-disciplinary teams to sharpen the formulation of the questions, to better focus the experimental design and to enhance the engineering of manipulations/experiments/monitoring and finally to improve the data analyses and explain the importance of the results including the boundaries of generalization.",

This study uses sequential digital elevation model (DEM) analysis to estimate the mass loss of glaciers in the upper Susitna drainage basin, Alaska Range, for the purpose of validating model simulations of past runoff changes. We use mainly stereo optical airborne and satellite data for several epochs between 1949 and 2014, and employ traditional stereo-photogrammetric and structure from motion processing techniques to derive DEMs of the upper Susitna basin glaciers.

The metabolic potential and genomic characteristics of microbes residing in fluids of this remote, anoxic region of the subsurface ocean were investigated using environmental DNA extracted from large-volume fluid samples obtained from advanced borehole observatories installed at two recently drilled IODP Boreholes, U1362A and U1362B. Fluids were collected from the deep (204 meters sub-basement) horizon of Borehole U1362A and shallow (40 meters sub-basement) horizon of Borehole U1362B and used to generate 503 and 705 million base-pairs of genomic DNA sequence data, respectively. Phylogenetically informative genes revealed that the community structure recovered via metagenomics was generally consistent with that obtained previously by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and was dominated by uncultivated bacterial lineages of Proteobacteria, Nitrospirae, Candidate Division OP8 (Aminicenantes), Thermotoga and archaeal groups THSCG, MCG (Bathyarchaeota), MBGE, and Archaeoglobus. Genes involved in phage integration, chemotaxis, nitrate reduction, methanogenesis, and amino acid degradation were all detected, revealing potentially dynamic microbial communities. Putative sulfate reduction genes were discovered within previously identified Firmicutes lineage Candidatus Desulforudis, along with other groups (e.g. Archaeoglobus). Significant metagenome assembly resulted in 72 and 105 contigs of >100 Kbp from U1362B and U1362A, respectively, including 1137, 977 and 356 Kbp-long contigs from Candidate Division OP8 residing in U1362B. These assemblies have revealed novel metabolic potential within abundant members of the deep subsurface microbial community, which can be directly related to their survival in the deep oceanic crust.",

            "abstract": "The highly visible phenomenon of wetland loss in coastal Louisiana (LA) is examined through the prism of carbon accumulation, wetland loss and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Mississippi River Deltaic region experiences higher relative sea level rise due to coupled subsidence and eustatic sea level rise allowing this region to serve as a proxy for future projected golbal sea level rise. Carbon storage or sequestration in rapidly subsiding LA coastal marsh soils is based on vertical marsh accretion and areal change data. While coastal marshes sequester significant amount of carbon through vertical accretion, large amounts of carbon, previously sequested in the soil profile is lost through annual deterioration of these coastal marshes as well as through GHG emissions. Efforts are underway in Louisiana to access the carbon credit market in order to provide significant funding for coastal restoration projects. However, there is very large uncertainty on GHG emission rates related to both marsh type and temporal (daily and seasonal) effects. Very little data currently exists which addresses this uncertainty which can significantly affect the carbon credit value of a particular wetland system. We provide an analysis of GHG emission rates for coastal freshwater, brackish and and salt marshes compared to the net soil carbon sequestration rate. Results demonstrate that there is very high uncertainty on GHG emissions which can substantially alter the carbon credit value of a particular wetland system.",

The combination of space weather, near earth orbiting objects, atmospheric conditions at the space boundary, and other phenomena can have significant short-term and long-term implications for the inhabitants of this planet. The importance of SSA has led to increased activity in this area from both space and ground based platforms. The emerging capability of CubeSats and SmallSats provides an opportunity for these low-cost, versatile platforms to augment the SSA infrastructure. The CubeSats and SmallSats can be launched opportunistically with shorter lead times than larger missions. They can be organized both as constellations or individual sensor elements. Combining CubeSats and SmallSats with the existing NASA communications networks (TDRS Space Network, Deep Space Network and the Near Earth Network) provide a backbone structure for SSA which can be tied to a SSA portal for data distribution and management. In this poster we will describe the instruments and sensors needed for CubeSat and SmallSat SSA missions. We will describe the architecture and concept of operations for a set of opportunistic, periodically launched, SSA CubeSats and SmallSats. We will also describe the integrated communications infrastructure to support end-to-end data delivery and management to a SSA portal.",

            "abstract": "One of the greatest challenges in regional climate prediction is distinguishing the anthropogenically-forced response from low-frequency internal variability. In a large ensemble, the forced response is well approximated by the mean trend of the ensemble members. However, in mountainous regions like the Pacific Northwest, very high model resolution is required to accurately represent the terrain, making large ensembles prohibitively expensive. Here we take a different approach, employing a statistical technique called \"dynamical adjustment\" to estimate the forced response of wintertime (DJF) surface temperature and precipitation within two high-resolution simulations of the 21st-century climate in the Pacific Northwest. The simulations were performed at 12-km resolution using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model, downscaled from global CCSM3 and ECHAM5 simulations under an A1B emissions scenario. While the raw simulations exhibit large differences in the magnitude and spatial structure of precipitation and surface temperature trends, dynamical adjustment results in much better agreement between the simulations, especially with regard to projected surface warming. These results suggest that dynamical adjustment of a small number of high-resolution simulations can provide much of the benefit of a large ensemble, but at far less computational expense.",

            "abstract": "This research concerns itself with modeling the geo-data related to seismic, atmospheric, climatic, and natural hazards processes as the self-optimization process of the Earth in the total energy state of itself. The self-optimization approach in the total energy state produces a structure embedded in a topological space with an equivalent energy mechanism (EEM). We call the energetically equivalent topological device model (EETDM) the model used in getting this EEM. The EETDM is applied as considering the whole Earth like a complete system with atmosphere and oceans getting inputs from the outside of Earth. The activities, inside and/or over Earth, are taken as boundary and initial conditions. All the structures relatable to seismicity, climatic processes, and natural hazards are considered as a complex topological network of distributed circuits involving irradiation, transfer, dissipation, conversion, and conserving of the total energy in such energetically equivalent topological devices (EETD). The suitable equivalence principles provide the reliability of the approach to get the results for our purposes in value. The critical operation sectors involve some irregular and singular characteristics suitable to the physics of the above said individual events. The model brings the interpretations of these irregularities and singularities with specific boundary conditions and settlements the complex topological boundary value problems sets. There are some couplings among such EETDs; therefore some transitions are observable among the several different kinds of events. We call the energetically equivalent complex topological device model of the complete system of Earth (EECTDMCSE) totally the estimation processes. The temporal variations at the mappings of EECTDMCSE at specific locations extract the mechanisms explaining the relationships among the characteristics of the distributed complex topological network and all above said physical phenomena of Earth in future.",

The practice and outcomes of disaster risk management will likely undergo further change as several emerging earth science technologies come of age: mobile devices; location-based services; ubiquitous sensors; drones; small satellites; satellite direct readout; Big Data analytics; cloud computing; Web services for predictive modeling, semantic reconciliation, and collaboration; and many others. Integrating these new technologies well requires developing and adapting them to meet current needs; but also rethinking current practice to draw on new capabilities to reach additional objectives. This requires a holistic view of the disaster risk management enterprise and of the analytical or operational capabilities afforded by these technologies.\nOne helpful tool for this assessment, the GEOSS Architecture for the Use of Remote Sensing Products in Disaster Management and Risk Assessment (Evans & Moe, 2013), considers all phases of the disaster risk management lifecycle for a comprehensive set of natural hazard types, and outlines common clusters of activities and their use of information and computation resources. We are using these architectural views, together with insights from current practice, to highlight effective, interrelated roles for emerging earth science technologies in disaster risk management. These roles may be helpful in creating roadmaps for research and development investment at national and international levels.",

Emphasis on the interpretation of these results, was detect environmental susceptibility areas associated at the water quality in Upper basin of Atoyac River, Puebla, Mexico. The environmental sub secretary of the state government of Puebla, Mexico has initiated actions to clean up the urban Atoyac River, with measurements of physicochemical parameters associated of the water quality in real-time monitoring and sampling network along the river.\nThe results identified an important role in the rivers, not only to receive and transport the contaminants associated with sedimentological and geochemical conditions, but magnified the effects of pollutant discharges. A significant concentration of hazardous metals in sediments of the dam, reflecting the geo-environmental conditions of anthropogenic Valsequillo Dam induction was determined. For example, a moderately contaminated Pb contaminated extreme class, and Cu and Zn contaminated with moderate to heavy contaminated under geoenvironment class index. Large concentration of clay minerals with larger surface areas was found there in the study, the minerals are definitely the fittest in nature to accept on their surfaces constitution of metals, metalloids and other contaminants which were reflected in the Geoenvironmental index.\nThe results of the studies performed here enable us to locate monitoring stations and sampling network to physicochemical parameters in real time, in the areas of higher contamination found in geoenvironmental studies Atoyac High River Basin. Similarly, we can elucidate the origin of pollutants and monitoring agents reflected in BOD5 (223 mg / l) and COD (610 mg / l), suspended solids totals (136 mg / l) and dissolved solids totals (840 mg / l), in others. Recent hydrometric data associated with the concentration of pollutants, allow us to report COD transportation charges up to 1690 ton/day and 616 ton/day of BOD5. Where clearly detect the contributions of domestic sewage, industrial and agricultural in non-meteoric water.\n  ",

            "abstract": "Forest-to-agriculture conversion has been shown to alter nutrient cycling and the community composition of soil microorganisms. However, few studies have looked simultaneously at how the abundance, composition, and diversity of microbial genes involved in nutrient cycling change with conversion. We used shotgun metagenomic sequencing to analyze soil from primary rainforest and converted cattle pasture sampled at the Fazenda Nova Vida in Rondônia, Brazil. The diversity, richness, and evenness of nutrient cycling genes were significantly higher in the pasture, and the composition of nutrient cycling communities differed significantly between land use types. These results largely mirror taxonomic shifts following Amazon rainforest conversion, which tends to increase diversity, richness, and evenness of soil microbial communities. The abundance of genes related to N cycling and methane flux differed between land use types. Methanotrophy genes decreased in abundance in the pasture, whereas methanogenesis genes were not significantly different between land use types. These changes could underlie the commonly observed shift from methane sink to source following forest-to-agriculture conversion. Multiple genes in the nitrogen cycle also differed with land use, including genes related to N-fixation and ammonification. Metagenomics provides a unique perspective on the consequences of land use change on microbial community structure and function.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is already affecting the Midwest U.S. Occurrence and intensity of extreme events such as heat waves, droughts and floods are expected to increase in the next few decades. It is the climate extremes, not averages, that have the greater impact on crop and livestock productivity which are vital for the State’s economy. Accordingly, potential changes in the hydrologic cycle under prospective climate conditions need to be addressed at the watershed scale for the Midwestern agricultural region to develop better management and adaptation solutions. For this purpose, the 3-D finite element model, HydroGeoSphere has been applied to and calibrated for a representative watershed in north-central Iowa, Tipton Creek watershed. The conceptual model for the watershed consists of all the elements of the hydrologic cycle from the ground surface through the Quaternary aquitard and into the underlying Mississippian limestone aquifer. Extreme wet and dry conditions derived from statistically downscaled climate model scenarios have been used as input to the basin model to simulate the impacts on streamflow and groundwater flow. The model accomplishes integrated hydrologic analysis by the coupled solution of the diffusion wave equation governing 2-D (areal) surface water flow and the Richards’ equation governing 3-D unsaturated/ saturated subsurface flow. Thus, actual evapotranspiration is calculated internally as a function of the soil moisture at each node of the defined evaporative zone at each time step and interdependent processes like recharge that are critical for climate change can be handled more accurately. Preliminary results for HadCM3 scenario combined with two SRES projections, A2 and A1fi predict more remarkable increases in stream levels in response to wet periods than the decreases in flows for dry periods in comparison to control (contemporary) period simulations. The impacts on the water table levels seem to be more prominent, in the range of ±4 m for dry and wet period simulations than for the potentiometric surface map changes that are 0-2.6 m of declines for the drought and up to 1.7 m of rise for the wet scenarios. The variations in the projected changes depend on the location throughout the model domain and the climate change scenario analyzed.",

In the same way that an ionosonde measures the ionospheric profile from the ground, a Topside Sounder measures the ionospheric profile from a location above the F-region peak. The TIS will address the need for increased space situational awareness and environmental monitoring by estimating electron density profiles in the topside of the ionosphere. The TIS will measure topside electron density profiles for plasma frequencies ranging from 0.89 MHz to 28.4 MHz below the satellite altitude. The precision of the measurement will be 5% or 10,000 p/cm^3. The TIS average power consumption will be below 10 W and a mass of less than 10 kg, so it is appropriate for a 6U Cubesat (or multiple of that size). The sounder will operate via a transmitted frequency sweep across the desired plasma frequencies which, upon reception, can be differenced to determine range and density information of the topside ionosphere. The velocity of the spacecraft necessitates careful balancing of range resolution and frequency knowledge requirements as well as novel processing techniques to correctly associate the return signal with the correct plasma frequency. TIS is being designed to provide a low cost, low mass spacecraft that can provide accurate topside profiles of the ionospheric electron density in order to further understanding of ionospheric structure and dynamic processes in the ionosphere.",

            "abstract": "Human impacts on climate are pervasive and significant and project future states cannot be projected without taking human influence into account. We recently helped convene a meeting of climatologists, policy analysts, lawyers and social scientists to discuss the dramatic loss in Arctic summer sea ice. A dialogue emerged around distinct time scales in the integrated human/natural climate system. Climate scientists tended to discuss engineering solutions as though they could be implemented immediately, whereas lags of 2 or more decades were estimated by social scientists for societal shifts and similar lags were cited for deployment by the engineers. Social scientists tended to project new climate states virtually overnight, while climatologists described time scales of decades to centuries for the system to respond to changes in forcing functions. For the conversation to develop, the group had to come to grips with an increasingly complex set of transient effect time scales and lags between decisions, changes in forcing, and system outputs.\nWe use several low-order dynamical system models to explore mismatched timescales, ranges of lags, and uncertainty in cost estimates on climate outcomes, focusing on Arctic-specific issues. In addition to lessons regarding what is/isn’t feasible from a policy and engineering perspective, these models provide a useful tool to concretize cross-disciplinary thinking. They are fast and easy to iterate through a large region of the problem space, while including surprising complexity in their evolution. Thus they are appropriate for investigating the implications of policy in an efficient, but not unrealistic physical setting. (Earth System Models, by contrast, can be too resource- and time-intensive for iteratively testing “what if” scenarios in cross-disciplinary collaborations.)\nOur runs indicate, for example, that the combined social, engineering and climate physics lags make it extremely unlikely that an ice-free summer ecology in the Arctic can be avoided. Further, if prospective remediation strategies are successful, a return to perennial ice conditions between one and two centuries from now is entirely likely, with interesting and large impacts on Northern economies.",

The primary scientific objective of this mission is to determine the contribution of small spatial and temporal scale fluctuations of the electric fields to the larger-scale processes during active aurora. This will be accomplished through the use of a constellation of six small payloads ejected at high velocity from a sounding rocket. The multiple baseline observations of the electric and magnetic fields will be used to observe variability of both the E-field and the Poynting flux. These observations will be placed in the context of available data, including winds, large scale E-fields, and proxy conductivity (airglow images) observations.\nEach sub-payload will carry a crossed pair of electric field double-probe sensors, a three-axis magnetometer, and a Langmuir probe. In total there are eight of each instrument type requireing calibration. Since the instruments need to be calibrated over temperature a full calibration of a single instrument is very time-consuming. The decision was made to automate the calibration process. Measurements were taken using a relay switch-box connecting the instruments to test sources. Calibration data were saved into a database. Using post-processing scripts on these databases a calibration for each instrument at each temperature point was made. This approach is a prototype process that might be used for calibrating a large constellation of CubeSats with similar instruments. In this poster we review the ASSP science and mission, and the results of the pre-flight calibration of the science instruments.",

            "abstract": "Landslide generated tsunamis such as Lituya Bay, Alaska 1958 account for some of highest recorded tsunami runup heights. Source and runup scenarios based on real world events are physically modeled using generalized Froude similarity in the three dimensional NEES tsunami wave basin at Oregon State University. A novel pneumatic landslide tsunami generator (LTG) was deployed to simulate landslides with varying geometry and kinematics. The bathymetric and topographic scenarios tested with the LTG are the basin-wide propagation and runup, fjord, curved headland fjord and a conical island setting representing a landslide off an island or a volcano flank collapse. The LTG consists of a sliding box filled with 1,350 kg of landslide material which is accelerated by pneumatic pistons down slope. Two different landslide materials are used to study the granulometry effects: naturally rounded river gravel and cobble mixtures.\nWater surface elevations are recorded by an array of resistance wave gauges. The landslide deformation is measured from above and underwater camera recordings. The landslide deposit is measured on the basin floor with a multiple transducer acoustic array (MTA). Landslide surface reconstruction and kinematics are determined with a stereo particle image velocimetry (PIV) system. Wave runup is recorded with resistance wave gauges along the slope and verified with video image processing. The measured landslide and wave parameters are compared between the planar hill slope used in various scenarios and the convex hill slope of the conical island. The energy conversion rates from the landslide motion to the wave train is quantified for the planar and convex hill slopes. The wave runup data on the opposing headland is analyzed and evaluated with wave theories. The measured landslide and tsunami data serve to validate and advance three-dimensional numerical landslide tsunami prediction models.\nTwo 3D Navier-Stokes models were tested, the commercial code FLOW-3D and the tsunami model TSUNAMI3D. The prediction of the wave fields and runups by the models were compared and analyzed to improve methodologies and key parameters for landslide rheology. Model errors with respect to the set of experiments were estimated and compared against the allowable errors indicated by the NTHMP.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric carbon monoxide (CO) is a product of incomplete combustion and oxidation of hydrocarbons. To model global CO concentrations accurately, a good representation of surface sources is critical. In recent years, several studies have tried to estimate CO sources using a top-down approach. It was found that model errors have a detrimental impact on the quality of the estimated emissions. Using the GEOS-Chem 4D-Var chemical data assimilation system, we try to mitigate the impact of errors in the model chemistry by constraining the distribution of the hyrdoxyl radical (OH), the principal sink of CO in the atmosphere. Since OH is influenced by the abundances of ozone (O3) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), we assimilate satellite retrievals of O3 from the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) and of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) alongside retrievals of CO from the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT). We examine the impact of assimilating these observations on the modeled OH abundances, as well as on the estimated emissions of CO and NOx.",

            "abstract": "Faults are known to affect basin-scale groundwater flow, and exert a profound control on petroleum migration/accumulation, the PVT-history of hydrothermal fluids, and the natural (submarine) seepage from offshore reservoirs. For example, in the Santa Barbara basin, measured gas flow data from a natural submarine seep area in the Santa Barbara Channel helps constrain fault permeability k ~ 30 millidarcys for the large-scale upward migration of methane-bearing formation fluids along one of the major fault zones. At another offshore site near Platform Holly, pressure-transducer time-series data from a 1.5 km deep exploration well in the South Ellwood Field demonstrate a strong ocean tidal component, due to vertical fault connectivity to the seafloor. Analytical solutions to the poroelastic flow equation can be used to extract both fault permeability and compressibility parameters, based on tidal-signal amplitude attenuation and phase shift at depth. These data have proven useful in constraining coupled hydrogeologic 2-D models for reactive flow and geomechanical deformation.\nIn a similar vein, our studies of faults in the Los Angeles basin, suggest an important role for the natural retention of fluids along the Newport-Inglewood fault zone. Based on the estimates of fault permeability derived above, we have also constructed new two-dimensional numerical simulations to characterize large-scale multiphase flow in complex heterogeneous and anisotropic geologic profiles, such as the Los Angeles basin. The numerical model was developed in our lab at Tufts from scratch, and based on an IMPES-type algorithm for a finite element/volume mesh. This numerical approach allowed us model large differentials in fluid saturation and relative permeability, caused by complex geological heterogeneities associated with sedimentation and faulting. Our two-phase flow models also replicated the formation-scale patterns of petroleum accumulation associated with the basin margin, where deep faults resulted in stacked petroleum reservoirs along the Newport-Inglewood Fault, as deep geofluids migrated out of the basin to the Palo Verde Peninsula. Recent isotope data collected by our group also verify fault connectivity at the deep crustal scale.",

            "abstract": "During a Snowball Earth event, almost all of the ocean surface first freezes as sea ice. As in modern sea ice, trapped inclusions of liquid brine permeate the ice cover. As the ice grows and cools, salt crystals precipitate within the inclusions. At -23C, the most abundant salt in seawater, sodium chloride, begins to precipitate as the dihydrate mineral hydrohalite (NaCl·2H2O).\nCrystals of hydrohalite within the sea ice scatter light. Measurements of cold, natural sea ice show a broadband albedo increase of 10-20% when salt precipitates. Such snow-free natural sea ice with a surface temperature below -23C is rare on modern Earth, but would have been common in tropical regions of a Snowball Earth where evaporation exceeded precipitation. The persistent cold and lack of summer melt on the Snowball ocean surface, combined with net evaporation, is hypothesized to yield lag deposits of hydrohalite crystals on the ice surface.\nTo investigate this process, we prepared laboratory-grown sea ice in a 1000 liter tank in a walk-in freezer laboratory. The ice was cooled below -23 C and the surface sprayed with a 23% NaCl solution to create a layer of hydrohalite-enriched ice, a proxy for lag deposits that would have formed over long periods of surface sublimation. We have developed a novel technique for measuring the spectral albedo of ice surfaces in the laboratory; this technique was used to monitor the evolution of the surface albedo of our salt crust as the ice matrix sublimated away leaving a layer of fine-grained hydrohalite crystals. Measurements of this hydrohalite surface crust show a very high albedo, comparable to fresh snow at visible wavelengths and significantly larger than fresh snow at near infrared wavelengths. Broadband albedos are 0.55 for bare artificial sea ice at -30C, 0.75 for ice containing 25% hydrohalite by volume, 0.84 after five days of desiccation and 0.93 after 47 days of desiccation.\nUsing our laboratory measurements, along with estimates of grain size and crust optical depth, as inputs to Mie scattering and radiative transfer models allowed us to infer the imaginary refractive index of hydrohalite. The model can calculate albedo for pure hydrohalite crusts of varying thickness and for mixtures of ice and hydrohalite. A parameterization is presented for albedo as a function of the thickness of the hydrohalite crust.",

            "abstract": "A major challenge for estimating discharges during flood events or in steep channels is the difficulty and hazard inherent in obtaining in-stream measurements. One possible solution is to use near-field remote sensing to obtain simultaneous water-surface elevations, slope, and surface velocities. In this test case, we utilized Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) to remotely measure water-surface elevations and slope in combination with surface velocities estimated from particle image velocimetry (PIV) obtained by video-camera and/or infrared camera. We tested this method at several sites in New Mexico and Colorado using independent validation data consisting of in-channel measurements from survey-grade GPS and Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) instruments. Preliminary results indicate that for relatively turbid or steep streams, TLS collects tens of thousands of water-surface elevations and slopes in minutes, much faster than conventional means and at relatively high precision, at least as good as continuous survey-grade GPS measurements. Estimated surface velocities from this technique are within 15% of measured velocity magnitudes and within 10 degrees from the measured velocity direction (using extrapolation from the shallowest bin of the ADCP measurements). Accurately aligning the PIV results into Cartesian coordinates appears to be one of the main sources of error, primarily due to the sensitivity at these shallow oblique look angles and the low numbers of stationary objects for rectification. Combining remotely-sensed water-surface elevations, slope, and surface velocities produces simultaneous velocity measurements from a large number of locations in the channel and is more spatially extensive than traditional velocity measurements. These factors make this technique useful for improving estimates of flow measurements during flood flows and in steep channels while also decreasing the difficulty and hazard associated with making measurements in these conditions.",

            "abstract": "Agriculture is the ‘backbone’ of the economies in East Africa and is dominated by smallholder farms that are mainly rain-fed and highly vulnerable to climate change, variability, and drought. However the region lacks access to developed, reliable, and effective data and analysis to guide planning for agriculture and drought mitigation. Advances in remote sensing technologies and associated tools enable the collection and quantitative analysis of observations over large geographic regions. As such, data from remote sensing platforms have become a critical tool in developed countries for climate adaptation, water resources management, drought planning and mitigation, and agriculture. Yet barriers remain in Africa due to cost (even as costs decline), issues of sustainability, and lack of capacity and expertise. A shift must be facilitated at the policy maker and practitioner level to adopt or incorporate remote sensing observations and analysis to make better, more informed decisions for drought and agricultural management and planning. Based on an on-going NASA-USAID SERVIR East Africa Drought and Crop Productivity project, recent experience is presented to illustrate best practices and lessons learned in transitioning NASA Earth Science research results to decision making in Kenya through capacity building.",

The impact of the drought is also exacerbated by the complexity of water issues in California, and the lack of understanding in the general public about this complexity. Our project has two goals, both focused on the broader issue of increasing the public’s understanding of water issues by helping scientists engage more effectively with the public. The first is to use a survey to assess the perceptions of California residents regarding the ongoing drought affecting the state. The first portion of our survey allows our participants to share, in a free response format, their understanding of the causes, consequences, and potential solutions to the problems caused by drought. This allowed us to get some insight into how people view the drought prior to being lead by our questions, and allows us to conduct a detailed linguistic analysis of the text they provide. Next we asked a battery of questions meant to assess our participants’ views on issues such as their views of water rights, the commoditization of water, and what role the government (both state and local) should play in managing California’s water. The second goal is to use this data to create profiles that can then be used to more effectively communicate with and educate the public. Together, the results will provide new and valuable insights into how views of drought vary across stakeholders, and could inform policies related to water use. The presentation will include discussion of these results, their implications for best practices by science communicators, and potential impact on policy.",

The broad goal of our research is to assess multi-temporal, HyspIRI-like satellite imagery for improved land cover mapping across a range of environmental and anthropogenic gradients in California. In this study, we mapped FAO Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) classes over 30,000 km2 in Northern California using multi-temporal HyspIRI imagery simulated from the AVIRIS airborne sensor. The three-season hyperspectral data were used to extract image endmembers for input into a Multiple-Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA). Classified maps are compared to that from Landsat 8 OLI. We hypothesize that the inclusion of phenological spectral variability from three-seasons, and the ability to resolve spectral features in the hyperspectral HyspIRI imagery, will improve the final classified map, especially with respect to deciduous tree species.",

            "abstract": "Particle composition measurements indicate that organic aerosol (OA) makes up ~20-90% of submicron particulate mass and secondary OA (SOA) accounts for a large fraction (~ 72 ±21%) of these OA masses at many locations around the globe. The volatility changes of secondary organic gases (SOG) associated with oxidation aging as well as the contribution of highly oxidized low volatile SOG (LV-SOG) to the condensational growth of secondary particles have been found to be important in laboratory and field measurements but are poorly represented in global models. A novel scheme to extend the widely used two-product SOA formation model, by adding a third product arising from the oxidation aging (i.e., LV-SOG) and considering the dynamic transfer of mass from higher to lower volatile products, has been developed and implemented into a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) and a community atmosphere model (CESM-CAM5). The scheme requires only minor changes to the existing two-product SOA formation model and is computationally efficient. With the oxidation rate constrained by laboratory measurements, we show that the new scheme predicts a much higher SOA mass concentrations, improving the agreement with aerosol mass spectrometer SOA measurements. The kinetic condensation of LV-SOG on ultrafine particles, simulated by a size-resolved (sectional) advanced particle microphysics (APM) model incorporated into in GEOS-Chem and CAM5, increases the particle growth rate substantially and improves the agreement of simulated cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations with observations. Based on GEOS-Chem-APM simulations, the new SOA formation scheme increases global mean low troposphere SOA mass concentration by ~130% and CCN abundance by ~ 15%, and optical depth of secondary particles and coated black carbon and primary organic carbon particles by ~10%. As a result, aerosol radiative cooling effect (direct + first indirect) is enhanced by -0.9 W/m2, with large spatial variations. CAM5-APM simulations show similar magnitude of impacts. The implication of oxidation aging to net direct and indirect radiative forcing of anthropogenic aerosols based on both GEOS-Chem-APM and CAM5-APM will be discussed.",

And yet, there were 61 towns and villages in Motosu county located in the hypocenter of the Nobi earthquake at the time, and there were 33,000 people. The 61 towns and villages were consisting with populations of 114 -3506, and households of 14-3508. \nGifu prefecture published a disaster report on the numbers of collapsed house and casualties by the earthquake, including the populations and households on all cities, towns in a week after the earthquake. Already Muramatsu (1983) and Iida (1985) discussed the Gifu prefecture disaster report, and they calculated the collapse rate and estimated the seismic intensities in the towns and villages. However, they never discuss precisely the disaster in each city, town and village. \nFirstly, we make a distribution map of the completely-collapse rates of the cities, towns and villages in Gifu and Aichi prefectures using GIS software. As Muramatsu already pointed out that there are two regions over 90% of collapse rates precisely. One is located along the Neodani fault, and it is a very narrow area. The other is located wide area in north Nobi Plain.\nSome research groups suggest another fault named Gifu-Ichinomiya line, because the region of seismic intensity 7 is estimated from Gifu to south Nagoya. However high collapse rate over 90% is not distributed as zones. It is suggested that collapsed houses are increased by shallow ground structures such as alluvium. \nSurely, alluvium is distributed with thick with 50 m maximally in the region. However, more local distribution of gravel layers and natural levee should affect the collapse distributions. \nAdditionally, there were remarkable house collapses in the high collapse rate region of at the 1944 M8.0 Tonankai earthquake, one of the mega-thrust earthquakes in Nankai trough. It is very important data at the Nobi earthquake to discuss the regional disaster in next earthquake.",

            "abstract": "One of the more striking aspects of Saturn's main ring system is its aspect ratio. It spans over 270,000 km from ansa to ansa, yet its thickness normal to the ring plane is less than a million times its breadth. Hence, studies of the rings’ structure focus mostly on radial and azimuthal features. But in the thermal infrared the finite vertical thickness of the main rings is clearly manifest in the measured temperature differences between that face of the rings exposed to direct solar illumination (the lit face) and the opposite (unlit) face derived from observations with Cassini's Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS).\nAs previous work has shown (Spilker et al., 2006), the thermal flux from Saturn’s rings observed by CIRS is a function of observing geometry. To control for these variations, we specifically designed paired observations of the lit and unlit sides of the rings where observing variables such as the emission, phase and local hour angles were kept as similar as possible to facilitate direct comparison between the lit and unlit observations. The ultimate goal of this work is to understand these lit/unlit temperature differentials and their variation with radius and optical depth. Constraining the amount of thermal energy exchange between the lit and unlit sides of the rings will allow us to derive information about the main rings' structure and dynamics in this third dimension. This presentation is a progress report on our analysis of such observations and our plans for future work.\nThis research was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract with NASA.

            "abstract": "Atmospheric aerosols affect Earth’s radiation balance directly by scattering and absorbing solar radiation and, indirectly, by changing the microphysical structure, lifetime and spatial extent of clouds. The aerosol mixing state to a large extent determines not only their optical properties (direct effect) but also their ability to serve as cloud condensation nuclei or ice nuclei (indirect effect). Results from previous research have highlighted the importance of the aerosol mixing assumptions in radiative forcing estimates in model simulations. Here we take a step further to analyze the differences in associated climate responses, using a multimodal, size- and mixing-dependent aerosol model (MARC) incorporated within the Community Earth System Model (CESM). The new model allows for a detailed representation of aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud interactions by including an improved treatment of aerosol mixing state and composition. First, we estimate and compare the magnitudes of direct and indirect forcing of anthropogenic aerosols under different mixing assumptions. We then carry out several century-long fully-coupled climate simulations designed to isolate the climate responses to direct and indirect forcings under the same aerosol mixing assumptions. In our analysis, we specifically focus on the following three climate response components: 1) cloud distribution and coverage; 2) precipitation amount and distribution; and 3) changes in circulation patterns.",

            "abstract": "Evaluating performance of agricultural varietals can support the identification of genotypes that will increase yield and can inform management practices. The biophysical limitations of photosynthesis are amongst the key factors that necessitate evaluation. This study evaluated how four biophysical limitations on photosynthesis, stomatal response to vapor pressure deficit, maximum carboxylation rate by Rubisco (Ac), rate of photosynthetic electron transport (Aj) and triose phosphate use (At) vary between four Brassica rapa genotypes. Leaf gas exchange data was used in an ecophysiological process model to conduct this evaluation. The Terrestrial Regional Ecosystem Exchange Simulator (TREES) integrates the carbon uptake and utilization rate limiting factors for plant growth. A Bayesian framework integrated in TREES here used net A as the target to estimate the four limiting factors for each genotype. As a first step the Bayesian framework was used for outlier detection, with data points outside the 95% confidence interval of model estimation eliminated. Next parameter estimation facilitated the evaluation of how the limiting factors on A different between genotypes. Parameters evaluated included maximum carboxylation rate (Vcmax), quantum yield (ϕJ), the ratio between Vc-max and electron transport rate (J), and trios phosphate utilization (TPU). Finally, as trios phosphate utilization has been shown to not play major role in the limiting A in many plants, the inclusion of At in models was evaluated using deviance information criteria (DIC). The outlier detection resulted in a narrowing in the estimated parameter distributions allowing for greater differentiation of genotypes. Results show genotypes vary in the how limitations shape assimilation. The range in Vc-max , a key parameter in Ac, was 203.2 - 223.9 umol m-2 s-1 while the range in ϕJ, a key parameter in AJ, was 0.463 - 0.497 umol m-2 s-1. The added complexity of the TPU limitation did not improve model performance in the genotypes assessed based on DIC. By identifying how varietals differ in their biophysical limitations on photosynthesis genotype selection can be informed for agricultural goals. Further work aims at applying this approach to a fifth limiting factor on photosynthesis, mesophyll conductance.",

            "abstract": "Solid Earth and ocean loading tides generate stresses that modulate slow slip and tremor on deep plate boundaries. Analysis of the influence of tidal stress on 35000 tremors located in a northern Cascadia region that ruptures repeatedly in M6.5 to 6.8 slow earthquakes has yielded several new findings (Houston, 2014, subm.). Tremor sensitivity to tidal stress is low for the first day or so of activity at a spot, but increases progressively over a few days of slip at that spot, constraining the pace of weakening during ETS. After the first day or so, sensitivity varies exponentially with stress. Consideration of an isotropic pore pressure model allows an in-situ estimate of intrinsic friction on the deep subduction interface, yielding values far below lab values (i.e., mu < 0.2). A model of threshold failure strength, in which tremor occurs when fault stress exceeds the strength, explains the evolving, increasing, exponential sensitivity to tides.\nBy applying a similar approach to the tremor that occurs between the major ETSs, I constrain the evolution of tidal sensitivity through the slow slip ‘seismic cycle’. About 40% of tremor in Cascadia occurs between major ETSs (Wech et al, 2010). Inter-ETS tremor groups of several months duration show some sensitivity to tidal stress, although not as much as tremor during the late portions of ETS. Interestingly, I see an evolution during the 12-15 month interval between major ETSs. In particular, tidal sensitivity increases moderately toward the end of the interval as the fault is reloaded and the next large ETS is imminent. First-order features are consistent with extension of the above-mentioned model of threshold failure strength versus stress. The concept is that during the inter-ETS period, strength rebuilds as the logarithm of time (e.g., Vidale et al, 1994) since the last major ETS, while average shear or Coulomb stress on the plate interface rebuilds roughly linearly due to plate convergence. Tidal stresses become more effective in triggering tremor later in the cycle as the linearly-growing stress approaches the logarithmically-growing strength. This approach illuminates the competition between healing on the plate interface and reloading with tectonic stress, and can help constrain healing rate and conditions on the deep subduction interface.",

Millions of images and relevant data have since been acquired using the instrument on the Landsat satellite to monitor the Earth’s interesting phenomena. There are Landsat receiving stations around the world including the United States that process and archive the images that are a unique resource for global change research and applications in agriculture, forestry, regional planning, geology, cartography and global warming. So far, National Oceanic Atmospheric and Administration (NOAA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), have launched a total of eight successfully orbiting satellites throughout its forty-two years of service.\nThe main objective of this project aims to use Landsat images to monitor the changes of the world’s largest lakes from 1972 to present. We focus on areas around the planet that are home to large scale lakes such as Lake Urmia, Lake Vanern, Lake Winnipegosis, Lake Albert and Lake Mweru. Then using U.S Geological Survey (USGS) database as a source for gathering cloud free images that are covering each lake, we were able to download and obtain necessary data. For larger lakes, images were mosaic to cover the entire area of the lake and using a Maximum Likelihood technique images were specifically classified into land and water content using ENVI software. The extent of the water content was quantified for each year and a temporal analysis of the area was performed. It is also found that the lakes which locates near the equator or at low latitude are seriously facing threats of becoming mostly dry. Future work is needed for establishing the dynamic characteristic of more lakes’ water extent changes and also to compare them with other available information such as precipitation and soil moisture in each region. In lakes where high latitude, the change in extent of ice during winter-time will be monitored as an indicator of climate change. ",

            "abstract": "Public understanding of climate change is fraught with misconceptions. In some cases, these may arise due to the complexity of the topic: the difference between personal experience of short-term weather events, for example, as compared to long-term analysis of a climate trend. In others, myths may be deliberately introduced: that climate has ceased to change, or that changes have been proven to be due to natural causes.\nWhatever their origin, these misconceptions hold powerful implications for education on climate change and related science topics. Conceptual change theory demonstrates how pre-existing misconceptions persist under regular instruction and interfere with student acquisition of correct concepts. Here, we assess the extent to which incorporating corrective instruction on misconceptions related to the greenhouse effect and on the role of human activities in climate change affects student acquisition and retention of key scientific concepts. We investigate the efficacy of this approach using two reading passages: one that simply discusses the science, and another that provides both science and misconceptions-related information. Study subjects were drawn from a first year Atmospheric Sciences course at a large public university, yielding 197 students who successfully completed the pretest, instructional treatment, immediate posttest, delayed posttest, and a background survey. While both treatments produced significant gains in the posttest and delayed posttest overall, only the treatment that directly targeted misconceptions produced long-term gains on misconception-related questions.\nOur results support the conceptual change model’s basic claim that misconceptions may persist through concept-based instruction, but may be uprooted by even a relatively brief reading passage that addresses them directly. However, our results also contain a striking anomaly: for questions involving the phrase “global warming,” misconceptions-based instruction did not produce greater long-term gain. Here, we analyze the influence of student demographics on performance overall as well as by question type, to begin to elucidate the extent to which pre-existing biases may influence the retention of misconceptions even in the face of corrective instruction.",

            "abstract": "Southern coastal willow (Salix caroliniana) is native to the Florida Everglades, commonly found on drier landforms like levees and tree islands. Shortened periods of inundation due to water management have led to the encroachment and expansion of these shrubs in sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense) marsh communities. The broadleaf willow is morphologically and physiologically different from the graminoid sedge sawgrass, with possible consequence for microhabitat conditions and ecosystem function. Willow is often assumed to have greater rates of transpiration, thereby affecting wetland water management, and may have concurrent differences in photosynthesis and carbon exchange. However, the ecophysiological impact of the willow invasion has not been quantified. We assessed differences in plant water and carbon exchange between willow and sawgrass at Blue Cypress Conservation Area, an impounded sawgrass peatland within the St. John’s River Water Management District (SJRWMD). Plant transpiration and net CO2 exchange (photosynthesis and autotrophic respiration) were measured on fully expanded, non-damaged leaves of sawgrass and willow using a portable infrared gas analyzer (LI-6400XT, LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, U.S.A.). The results obtained from this study will provide a better understanding of ecophysiological changes that occur within marsh communities with shrub expansion, which will have cascading impacts on soil accretion and turnover, microclimate, and water quality Understanding the implications of willow expansion will improve landscape models of wetland water and carbon exchange as well as inform water management decisions.",

            "abstract": "For most of its bathymetric survey activities, the Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) requires high precision, three dimensional positioning. As part of a pilot project, one of its launches was equipped with a GNSS receiver processing a high precision correction service in real time (HP-GPS*C) via the internet using satellite telecommunication. This service was provided by Natural Resources Canada/Canadian Geodetic Survey (NRCan/CGS). The bathymetric data from a survey in eastern Hudson Bay performed by CHS in Fall 2013 was post –processed using different standard methods. This resulted in high precision positions that were compared with positions corrected with the real-time precise point positioning (PPP) service (HP-GPS*C) from NRCan/CGS.\n CHS bathymetric surveys must be referred to chart datum, the hydrographical vertical datum defined for use on nautical charts. In the Canadian north, another limitation to high precision bathymetric work is the availability of tide observations and/or predictions. The territory is vast and tide data is limited in space and in time while predicted tides are not always accurate. This makes reductions of bathymetric soundings to Chart datum difficult. To address this problem, CHS and NRCan/CGS have collaborated to produce a Continuous Vertical Datum for Canadian Waters (CVDCW), which incorporates data from NRCan's geoid model, tide gauge and GPS data, satellite altimetry, and ocean models. Thus high precision positioning provides ellipsoidal heights for the bathymetric depths, and the CVDCW allows to correct these ellipsoidal heights to chart datum. Comparisons of the bathymetry from the pilot survey corrected for tide data versus the bathymetry referred to its ellipsoidal height corrected to chart datum with the CVDCW are given to demonstrate the relative changes to the depths. This also illustrates the advantage of a continuous vertical datum with its potential to be combined with real-time high precision positioning.",

Hajj, an annual pilgrimage of Islam, draws millions of pilgrims from more than 200 countries for religious rituals in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The city is surrounded by mountains with a population of 1.7 million, which gets doubles or even more during Hajj. The city centers on the Grand Mosque (Masjid Al-haram), connected with the network of tunnels. Main Hajj pilgrimage route for five days extends 20 km to the east and includes “Mina”, “Arafat”, and “Muzdalifah”. A detailed study was conducted in Mecca, its tunnels, and surrounding holy places during Hajj (October 13-17, 2013). Spatial and temporal variations in total suspended particulate (TSP), PM10 , PM7 , PM2.5 , PM1 , ozone (O3), and black carbon (BC) levels along the route were recorded using portable monitors and GPS to assess the status of air quality. This is the first study to elucidate the exposure to air pollutants among pilgrims. Extremely high levels of all pollutants were observed during the intensive measuring periods. For example, the PM7 , PM2.5 , O3, and BC concentrations of up to 9,433 µg/m3, 484 µg/m3, 444 ppb, and 468 µg/m3, respectively, were observed. Results of this investigation revealed that most routes had on average exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) standards for PM10 and PM2.5 . The reasons for the high air pollutants concentrations are most probably high volume of traffic, construction work, re-suspension of particles, and geographical conditions (arid regions). The pilgrim’s longer trip duration lead to their highest whole trip exposure to air pollutants, which indicate that they are possibly subject to higher health risk. Better understanding of air pollution exposure and their determinants in the environments will contribute to the development of more appropriate exposure reductive strategies and have significant public health meanings.",

            "abstract": "In the past two decades, a number of seismic velocity anomalies have been identified in the bottom 200-300 km of the lower mantle above the core-mantle boundary (CMB). Deciphering the observed seismic anomalies in the region has attracted extensive research interests. Of particular importance is the discovery of Mg-silicate perovskite (Pv) to post-perovskite (PPv) phase transition, which has shed light on understanding the abnormal behavior above the CMB. In this study, we have investigated the combined effect of Fe and Al on the electronic spin and valence states as well as the equation of state of PPv using synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Mössbauer spectroscopy in high-pressure diamond anvil cells. We have synthesized two PPv samples, Mg0.6Fe0.15Al0.5Si0.75O3 and Mg0.66Fe0.13Al0.28Si0.86O3, at ~165 GPa and 2200-2500 K. By analyzing the collected Mössbauer spectra, we found that most Fe2+ and Fe3+ occupy the large bipolar prismatic sites in both of our samples. All of the Fe remains in the high-spin state at ~165-168 GPa and 300 K, which is consistent with theoretical predications. Together with the X-ray diffraction results, we have noted that the unit cell volume and density of PPv are significantly affected by the spin and valence states of Fe and the Al substitution. Using these results, we have further modeled the density and velocity change across the perovskite and PPv phase transition. The combined effect of Fe and Al will cause an increase in density but a decrease in the bulk sound velocity. As a result, the Fe and Al rich PPv existing above the CMB would be shown as relatively high-density and low-velocity regions.",

NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) ModelE2 General Circulation Model (GCM) was recently equipped with a complete Global Carbon Cycle algorithm, consisting of three integrated components: Ent Terrestrial Biosphere Model (Ent TBM), Ocean Biogeochemistry Module and atmospheric CO2 tracer. Ent TBM provides CO2 fluxes from the land surface to the atmosphere. Its biophysics utilizes the well-known photosynthesis functions of Farqhuar, von Caemmerer, and Berry and Farqhuar and von Caemmerer, and stomatal conductance of Ball and Berry. Its phenology is based on temperature, drought, and radiation fluxes, and growth is controlled via allocation of carbon from labile carbohydrate reserve storage to different plant components. Soil biogeochemistry is based on the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford (CASA) model of Potter et al. Ocean biogeochemistry module (the NASA Ocean Biogeochemistry Model, NOBM), computes prognostic distributions for biotic and abiotic fields that influence the air-sea flux of CO2 and the deep ocean carbon transport and storage. Atmospheric CO2 is advected with a quadratic upstream algorithm implemented in atmospheric part of ModelE2.\nHere we present the results for pre-industrial equilibrium and modern transient simulations and provide comparison to available observations.

            "abstract": "Volcanic gas fluxes give important information on both the amount of degassing and magma reservoirs. In most of magmas, water vapor (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are major components of volcanic gas. However, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is one of the targets of remote sensing due to their low concentration in the environment and easy detection by ultraviolet spectroscopy. Accordingly, plume imaging using passive ultraviolet cameras is a relatively simple method to study volcanic degassing, expeditious manner and can be used up from distances of about 10 km from source of emissions.\nWe estimated SO2 concentrations and fluxes in volcanic plumes with the ultraviolet camera Envicam-2, developed by Nicarnica Aviation, acquired by the Geological Survey of Chile (SERNAGEOMIN). The camera has filters that allow passage of ultraviolet radiation at wavelengths of interest. For determining whether there is absorption of radiation associated with the presence of SO2 the Beer-Lambert law was used for quantifying concentrations using appropriate calibration cells. SO2 emissions to the atmosphere were estimated using wind speed as an approximation to the plume transport. In this study we reported the implementation of a new methodology for using Envicam-2 and subsequent collection of SO2 concentrations and fluxes in passive degassing volcanoes. Measurements were done at Lascar, Ollagüe and Irruputuncu volcanoes, located in northern Chile. The volcanoes were chosen because of optimal atmospheric conditions for ultraviolet imaging.\nResults indicate concentrations within the expected ranges for three volcanoes generally between 400-1700 ppm∙m. In the case of Láscar volcano, the emission rates of SO2 range from 250 to 500 tonnes/day for a same image of the plume. In particular, wind speed was determined from scaling images and are consistent with data from regional numerical models, as well as records of the meteorological stations installed at the ALMA astronomical center, located about 40 km north of the volcano.\nThis study reveals new insights and challenges related to remote sensing of volcanic gases in Chile. In particular, the evolution of the SO2 emission in active volcanoes can be a powerful monitoring tool that can be complemented with other geophysical techniques.",

            "abstract": "The Humu’ula Groundwater Research Project (HGRP) drilled a continuously-cored hole to nearly 2 km depth near the Saddle Road between Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea volcanoes on Hawaii Island in March of 2013. Temperatures at the bottom of the hole were unexpectedly high and reached over 100 C. A study is underway to characterize hydrothermal (secondary) mineralization in the core at depths below ~ 1 km. Secondary mineralization can indicate the presence, chemistry, and temperature of hydrothermal fluids, therein helping to characterize a present and/or past geothermal system.\nTo date, the study is two pronged. In collaboration with University Nevada Reno (UNR) we used an Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) FieldSpec instrument to obtain nearly 800 spectra from core depths spanning 3190 to 5785 feet. This device has a 2 cm contact probe that measures from 0.4 to 2.5 mm, and has been used successfully by UNR to identify depth-associated changes in alteration mineralogy and zoning in drill core from other pilot studies. The spectra indicate that rocks above a depth of ~1 km are only weakly altered. At greater depths to the base of the well, chlorite, possibly with some mica, and zeolites are common. The majority of zeolites are spectrally similar to each other at these wavelengths, however analcime and natrolite are uniquely identified in some sections. Epidote was not observed. The secondary mineral assemblages suggest that the alteration was produced by moderate temperature neutral pH fluids.\nHere, we used the spectral data as a survey tool to help identify and select over 20 sections of core for sampling and more detailed mineralogical analysis using traditional X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and petrographic techniques, conducted in collaboration with University of Utah. This presentation will include mineral maps with depth and results of the petrographic analyses.",

            "abstract": "Over the last two decades, the role of vegetation in the environmental and ecological restoration of surface water bodies has received much attention. Numerous studies have investigated the effects of vegetation on flow velocity at various locations ranging from the floodplain, river-bank and main channel. There is a general agreement amongst such studies, that the presence of vegetation may cause a decrease in flow velocity locally, followed by increased flows laterally, in non-vegetated regions. This experimental study attempts to present the findings of an elaborate set of flow measurements that aim at quantifying changes to the flow field at the main channel, at the bank inside the vegetated region and at their interface, for increasing vegetation density. To this goal an inclined section is constructed with acrylic panels sloping at, in a 1.8m wide re-circulating flume, to simulate the stream-bank. The main-channel bed comprises of coarse sand of 1.5mm nominal diameter, while 6mm diameter acrylic rods are used to simulate the vegetated river-bank. Ten velocity and turbulent intensity profiles are developed across the test cross-section, for each vegetation density, via acoustic Doppler velocimetry along a fine measurement grid. The experiments are run under uniform flow and stable bed conditions, for a range of six different vegetation densities changed by adding more vegetation elements in a staggered arrangement along the stream-bank. These detailed observations are further analyzed, with emphasis on the effects on the main channel. Measurements near the bed with implications for sediment transport are further discussed.",

We will show that while the observed humidity inside and outside of TTL cirrus clouds is frequently supersaturated with respect to hexagonal ice, these measurements are in good agreement with conventional theories of ice nucleation and deposition. The ATTREX observations provide valuable statistics of relative humidity (RHi) in the TTL. We use these observations to evaluate the frequency distribution of RHi inside and outside of cirrus clouds, and begin to constrain the error that may be incurred in models that calculate stratospheric WV by assuming RHi does not exceed 100% in the TTL.",

Resolved turbulence is defined here as the model-produced fluctuations from the azimuthal-average (i.e., mesoscale) flow of the hurricane. The distribution of resolved turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) compares well with recent airborne-radar-based studies that show a maximum of TKE at the eye-eyewall interface, especially below 2 km ASL and just inward of the radius of maximum winds. Compared to the parameterized TKE in the model, the magnitude of resolved TKE is typically more than an order of magnitude larger except (as expected) very near the surface. The resolved TKE budget further shows that TKE mean-flow advection, pressure-interaction term, and eddy transport terms are not negligible, as surmised in recent observations-based studies that could not measure these terms. Budgets of angular momentum, and moist entropy are also analyzed and compared with recent modeling studies that rely entirely on parameterized turbulence. The LES output supports previous studies in the sense that turbulence acts primarily to reduce the radial gradients of both angular momentum and moist entropy in the eyewall of simulated hurricanes.",

            "abstract": "Transit time distributions (TTD) are an efficient way of characterizing transport through the complex flow dynamics of a hydrologic system, and can serve as a basis for spatially-integrated solute transport modeling. Recently there has been progress in the development of a theory of time-variable TTDs that captures the effect of temporal variability in the timing of fluxes as well as changes in flow pathways. Furthermore, a new formulation of this theory allows the essential transport properties of a system to be parameterized by a physically meaningful time-variable probability distribution, the Ω function. This distribution determines how the age distribution of water in storage is sampled by the outflow. The form of the Ω function varies if the flow pathways change, but is not determined by the timing of fluxes (unlike the TTD). In this study, we use this theory to characterize transport by transient flows through a homogeneously packed 1 m3 sloping soil lysimeter. The transit time distribution associated with each of four irrigation periods (repeated daily for 24 days) are compared to examine the significance of changes in the Ω function due to variations in total storage, antecedent conditions, and precipitation intensity. We observe both the time-variable TTD and the Ω function experimentally by applying the PERTH method (Harman and Kim, 2014, GRL, 41, 1567-1575). The method allows us to observe multiple overlapping time-variable TTD in controlled experiments using only two conservative tracers. We hypothesize that both the TTD and the Ω function will vary in time, even in this small scale, because water will take different flow pathways depending on the initial state of the lysimeter and irrigation intensity. However, based on primarily modeling, we conjecture that major variability in the Ω function will be limited to a period during and immediately after each irrigation. We anticipate the Ω function is almost time-invariant (or scales simply with total storage) during the recession period because flow pathways are stable during this period. This is one of the first experimental studies of this type, and the results offer insights into solute transport in transient, variably-saturated systems.",

            "abstract": "The Planar Langmuir Probe, PLP, in its simplest form is just a flat plate and perhaps a guard ring placed on the ram side of a Low Earth Orbit spacecraft such that it can intersect an uninterrupted flow of plasma. At small negative potential, it measures the ion ram current and thus the ion density with great accuracy, and when swept to positive potential, electrons are collected and the electron temperature may be extracted from the current-voltage characteristic. With rapid sampling, the turbulence spectrum of the plasma may also be sampled. AFRL has pioneered the development and application of the PLP for close to 2 decades. The PLP was used on numerous rocket flights in the 90’s, was flown on the CHAMP satellite from 2002 to 2011, on the C/NOFS satellite from 2008 to present, and a new version is in development for possible future flights. This talk will review the design variations to date, data validation, lessons learned, and theory of operation. In particular we will present methods for extracting the electron temperature from the current-voltage characteristic, and address how the probes can measure higher moments of the electron distribution as suggested by the observations of Rother et.al.

            "abstract": "The inverse problem we often focus on in geophysics is to try to recover a subsurface model with data obtained from one or more geophysical survey methods, e.g. seismic or electrical methods, while the model parameters are corresponding petrophysical properties, e.g. density, velocity or electrical resistivity. If any prior information about the subsurface structure is given, for instance a guiding image believed to reflects the true structure features is available, we can incorporate it into the regularization term in the inversion, construct the model covariance and perform a structure-constrained inversion. Previous works have shown that compared to conventional inversion algorithms which use homogeneous and stationary regularization term, the image-guided structure-constrained inversion result not only honor the structure features of subsurface, but also tend to better recover the value of the petrophysical parameters of interest. So far, we have considered the guiding image to be perfectly known. If we reverse the concept, instead of trying to find the best geophysical model under constraint of known structure, we assume the subsurface structure is unknown and try to look for the image (or the set of images) which has the highest probability to be correct. This process can be achieved using a Bayesian approach of image-guided inversion. The idea is to parameterize structure features such as faults and sediment layer boundaries into random variables, each of which has a prior probability density. The data vector collected from geophysical survey is fixed, but each random vector of those structure parameters corresponds to a different guiding image, hence generates a different image-guided inversion result. An adaptive Metropolis MCMC algorithm will automatically and efficiently find the proposal distributions of the structure parameters, of which the corresponding images will result in inverted models with less data misfit, hence more possible to be the right image. We will discuss in details the theory of image-guided structure-constrained inversion and the Bayesian scheme. Using electrical resistivity data as an example, one synthetic case and one field case will be investigated. Structural modeling through this effective technique can be very helpful to all kinds of geophysical characterizations.",

            "abstract": "The increase in awareness about the overexploitation of transboundary groundwater resources in hyper-arid environments that occurred in the last decades has highlighted the need to better map, monitor and manage these resources. Climate change, economic and population growth are driving forces that put more pressure on these fragile but fundamental resources. The aim of our approach is to address the question of whether or not groundwater resources, especially non-renewable, could serve as “backstop” water resource during water shortage periods that would probably affect the drylands in the upcoming 100 years. The high dependence of arid regions on these resources requires prudent management to be able to preserve their fossil aquifers and exploit them in a more sustainable way. We use the NetLogo environment with the FAO Aquastat Database to evaluate if the actual trends of extraction, consumption and use of non-renewable groundwater resources would remain feasible with the future climate change impacts and the population growth scenarios. The case studies selected are three: the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System, shared between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad; the North Western Sahara Aquifer System, with Algeria, Tunisia and Libya and the Umm Radhuma Dammam Aquifer, in its central part, shared between Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Bahrain. The reason these three fossil aquifers were selected are manifold. First, they represent properly transboundary non-renewable groundwater resources, with all the implications that derive from this, i.e. the necessity of scientific and socio-political cooperation among riparians, the importance of monitoring the status of shared resources and the need to elaborate a shared management policy. Furthermore, each country is characterized by hyper-arid climatic conditions, which will be exacerbated in the next century by climate change and lead to probable severe water shortage periods. Together with climate change, the rate of population growth will be at unprecedented levels for these areas causing the water demand of these nations to grow largely. Our preliminary simulation results suggest that fossil aquifers cannot be used as a long-term solution for water shortage in hyper-arid environments. Aquifers in the Arabian Peninsula are forecasted to be depleted within decades.",

            "abstract": "North-dipping, low-angle normal faults of the South Tibetan detachment system (STDS) can be traced for a distance of more than 2000 km along strike and represent an important tectonic characteristic of the Miocene Himalayan-Tibetan orogenic system. Nowhere is the STDS better exposed than the N-S–trending Rongbuk Valley in southern Tibet, where it can be traced down dip from the summit of Everest for a distance of over 30 km before disappearing beneath the valley floor. This places a minimum constraint on Miocene displacement on the feature in this area, but some research groups have suggested ~200 km of displacement based on the difference in metamorphic pressures across the STDS and the very low (< 15˚) primary dip of the structure. We are exploring this issue further using developing (U-Th)/He and 40Ar/39Ar datasets from deformed footwall sillimanite gneisses and leucogranites. Data obtained thus far indicate relatively rapid cooling of the footwall after the intrusion of deformed leucogranites at ca. 16.7 Ma to muscovite 40Ar/39Ar closure temperatures (ca. 15.5-14.2 Ma) and zircon (U-Th)/He closure temperatures (ca. 14.5-11 Ma). We attribute this cooling to tectonic denudation related to ca. 16 Ma STDS slip. Although the (U-Th)/He systematics of apatites from these rocks is complex, our current interpretation of available data places cooling through the ca. 75˚C closure isotherm at ca. 8-9 Ma, which would suggest a significant reduction in cooling rate that is observed in our inverse model runs of the 1D program, HeFTy. Ongoing analyses of footwall samples from ~8 km to the north of our Rongbuk sample localities in the Ra Chu river valley will greatly strengthen our datasets. With the Ra Chu analyses, our datasets will constrain the cooling history of the footwall for more than 20 km perpendicular to the strike of the detachment. Our presentation will also incorporate results from the program Pecube that will contribute to our calculation of the slip rate by specifying the appropriate exhumation rate.",

            "abstract": "Climatic conditions in the Karakoram mountains are often considered to differ from those elsewhere in the Himalayan region as glaciers appear to have shown limited decline, if not some growth, during the late twentieth century. The so-termed Karakoram Anomaly suggests that either precipitation as snow increased or, in contrast to conditions in other mountain areas, summer temperatures either declined or at least failed to increase at rates similar to those observed elsewhere. Meteorological records from stations albeit at relatively low elevations in valleys within the Karakoram in the period 1900-2013 have been examined together with those from surrounding mountain areas with a view to determining temporal patterns of climatic variation and the extent to which such variations in the Karakoram have differed from those observed in the western Himalaya, on the western part of the Xizang plateau, and in the southern Pamirs. In areas surrounding the Karakoram, air temperatures increased from the 1960s to 1970s and then decreased to the late 1980s/early 1990s before rising to maxima in the 2000s. At Karakoram valley stations, temperatures declined from the 1960s/1970s to the 1990s. Air temperature hardly recovered into the 2000s. Precipitation in the both Karakoram and surrounding areas varied considerably from year-to-year. At Karakoram stations, winter precipitation increased slightly from the 1990s to 2000s whilst summer precipitation increased steadily from the 1960s. Summer precipitation both increased and decreased in surrounding areas. Valley bottoms in the Karakoram are arid, but snowfall at higher elevations on glaciers reduces flow whilst there is little seasonal snow off-glacier to melt and moderate year-to-year variations in runoff.",

For this purpose, hundreds of spectra have been simulated that represent the range of clear and cloudy conditions experienced in the Arctic, at resolutions ranging from perfect (monochromatic) to less than 8 cm-1. This dataset allows retrievals to be performed on many different realizations of the Arctic atmosphere to develop statistical knowledge of how well the retrieval system performs. Since simulated spectra are used, the atmospheric and cloud conditions are a priori and can thus be compared with what is retrieved. Retrieved properties include cloud height and cloud microphysical properties. For cloud height, three methods are compared: CO2-sorting, the Minimum Local Emissivity Variance, and optimal estimation. Retrievals of cloud microphysical properties are found to be relatively insensitive to the resolution of the infrared spectra, because cloud properties vary slowly across the infrared spectrum.",

The TGIS and surrounding grounded ice has the largest thinning signal in East Antarctica\nand the nature of the thinning suggests that it is driven by enhanced basal melting due to ocean processes\n. Warm Modified Circumpolar Deep Water (MCDW), which has been linked to glacier retreat in West Antarctica, has been observed in summer and winter on the SC continental shelf in the 400-500 m depth range. Here we show, using new data from recent aerogeophysical flights, that entrances to the cavity exist that are deeper than this range of thermocline depths, indicating that the TGIS is vulnerable to intrusions of MCDW if the vertical structure of cavity inflow is similar to the nearest observations. We provide evidence that a new entry to the cavity has opened likely due to the interplay between thinning ice and subglacial channels that could be related to regional mass loss acceleration observed in 2006. This new connection may increase access of warm water to the east side of the ice shelf, potentially destabilizing the low-lying area to the east of the TGIS.",

            "abstract": "Species distribution models (SDMs) are statistical tools that combine data on the locations where a species is known to occur with data on the environment. The resulting species-environment relationships are then used to identify regions a species could occupy and are often used to make predictions about how a species will respond to climate change. The data used in SDMs generally exhibit a pattern known as spatial autocorrelation (SAC), which is the positive association between the proximity of sample locations. The presence of SAC violates the statistical assumptions that must be met for unbiased estimation of species-environment relationships and can cause traditional SDMs to exhibit low predictive accuracy. To determine the effects of SAC on predicting species’ responses to climate change, the distributions of three species of trout were predicted throughout the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. Measures of contemporary streamflow, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and sediment concentration are based on model outputs from the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) landscape scale hydrological model. SWAT-derived future hydrological conditions driven by downscaled General Circulation Models (GCMs) indicate that increasing temperatures and changes in precipitation will alter these variables across the region, all of which have the ability to negatively impact the distribution of trout species. Trout distribution data along with data on contemporary stream flow, water temperature, dissolved oxygen and sediment concentration from the years 1990 to 1999 were used to develop both spatial and non-spatial SDMs for each species. These species-environment relationships along with data on future environmental conditions for the years 2050-2059 derived from three separate GCM scenarios were then used to predict the future distribution of each species. Predictions from spatial and non-spatial models will be discussed with a focus on the difference in area and the amount of overlap between current and future distributions of each species.",

            "abstract": "Fresh Shallow Valleys (FSVs) on Mars are part of a growing inventory of post-Noachian landforms that may be related to late, widespread aqueous activity that occurred during a period once thought to be less favorable for precipitation and runoff. Constraining the source, magnitude, timing and duration of FSVs will provide insight into the mechanism and extent of fluvial activity on Mars and the geologic and climatic environments in which they formed. Unlike the older Noachian-Hesperian valleys that are characterized by integrated, dissected and degraded networks that cover large spatial extents, FSVs are typically narrow, short or discontinuous valleys with low drainage densities. They are generally incised no more than a few decameters, slightly degraded at multi-meter scales, and cluster in the mid-latitudes (35-50° in both hemispheres). A high concentration of FSVs occurs in Northern Arabia Terra (~33°N, 8°E), a Noachian-aged landscape characterized by broad, irregular depressions. Many of the FSVs in this region are 150+ km long and some appear to cross depressions that were likely filled with ice or water at the time of formation. Examples of broad, flat floored FSVs with incised channels could either indicate a complex history of a single flow event or multiple flow events. The occurrence of “pollywogs,” fairly fresh, small (typically 2-10 km in diameter) craters with a single channel extending from the rim outward, implies overflow of the crater, the presence of a deep lake and the involvement of artesian groundwater flow. Roughly 25% of the FSVs in our northern Arabia Terra study region occur on relatively fresh crater ejecta, which may be related to formation age, topography, surface materials and (or) substrate. Ejecta with dense concentrations of FSVs average 25.5 km in diameter, have more degraded crater interiors, and well developed petal-like ejecta. Ejecta with sparse or no FSVs have radial ejecta with less distinct petals and are associated with smaller craters (16 km and 8 km in diameter, respectively) that have less degraded crater interiors. Crater statistics suggest ejecta with high concentrations of FSVs are relatively older than ejecta with sparse or no FSVs. The crater statistics also suggest the valleys formed in the mid-Hesperian to Early-Amazonian, coeval with the formation of large alluvial fans.",

In a profile parallel to the fault, 78% of the readings were > 100 pCi/L, confirming the presence of the fault along the swath surveyed.\nAt Site 3 we compiled observations of post-earthquake cracks, conducted reconnaissance, and measured some profiles using 100 MHz GPR. These observations showed that the cracks are associated with ground failure due to earthquake shaking.\nAt Site 4 our new 222Radon gas measurements complemented a pre-existing profile that had high 222Radon values lacking a structural explanation. Related to this we found that this region has two NW-SE trending features: a magnetic anomaly low of 360 nT (Evans, Summer and Castillo, 1972) and a graben reported by the Mexican Geological Survey in 2003.\nEarthquake patterns and seismic studies in a wider area north of the border indicate a possible buried fault a few km west of the Imperial fault, as well as short NE-striking faults controlling basement structure. These results highlight some very useful methods for finding fault traces in a flat region covered with agricultural fields or disturbed by anthropogenic activity.",

            "abstract": "Urbanization will arguably be the most significant demographic trend of the 21st century, particularly in fast-growing regions of the developing world. Characterizing urbanization in a spatial context, however, is a difficult task given only the moderate resolution data provided by traditional sources of demographic data (i.e., censuses and surveys). Using a sample of five world “mega-cities” we demonstrate how new satellite data products and new analysis of existing satellite data, when combined with new applications of census and survey microdata, can reveal more about cities and urbanization in combination than either data type can by itself.\nIn addition to the partially modelled Global Urban-Rural Mapping Project (GRUMP) urban extents we consider four sources of remotely sensed data that can be used to estimate urban extents; the NOAA Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System (OLS) intercallibrated nighttime lights time series data, the newer NOAA Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) nighttime lights data, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) radar satellite data, and Dense Sampling Method (DSM) analysis of the NASA scatterometer data. Demographic data come from national censuses and/or georeferenced survey data from the Demographic & Health Survey (DHS) program. We overlay demographic and remotely sensed data (e.g., Figs 1, 2) to address two questions; (1) how well do satellite derived measures of urban intensity correlate with demographic measures, and (2) how well are temporal changes in the data correlated. Using spatial regression techniques, we then estimate statistical relationships (controlling for influences such as elevation, coastal proximity, and economic development) between the remotely sensed and demographic data and test the ability of each to predict the other.\nSatellite derived imagery help us to better understand the evolution of the built environment and urban form, while the underlying demographic data provide information regarding composition of urban population change. Combining these types of data yields important, high resolution spatial information that provides a more accurate understanding of urban processes.",

            "abstract": "We study the effect of microlites and permeability on the Plinian style eruption of basaltic magma at Mt. Tarawera, New Zealand (1886 CE) and Mt. Etna, Italy (122 BCE). The syneruptive nucleation and growth of microlites will increase magma viscosity and affect bubble growth, as well as bubble coalescence. Increased viscous resistance to bubble growth may result in the build-up of bubble overpressure, whereas permeability may allow pressurized magmatic volatiles to escape from the magma, thereby reducing bubble overpressure. Thus, it is important to understand the competing effect of these two parameters on the bubble and conduit dynamics during these volcanic eruptions.\nWe measured and analyzed the permeability of 29 pyroclasts from these two basaltic Plinian eruptions. We obtained Darcian permeabilities in the range of approximately 10−12 to 10−11 m2 over a range in porosity spanning 0.47 − 0.78. In order to investigate the effect of permeability and microlites, we modeled coupled bubble growth and flow of magma in a volcanic conduit, where we accounted for the nucleation and growth of microlites, by using the Avrami equation, and for the development of permeability, using the empirical relationship between permeability and porosity for each eruption. We find that increased viscosity of the basaltic melt due to the presence of microlites overrides the effect of permeable outgassing, such that, it generates sufficient bubble overpressure required for magma fragmentation during these basaltic Plinian eruptions.",

            "abstract": "High resolution climate models generate huge amounts of data. In recent days, with wide-spread availability of large computing resources, the amount of data is growing at an exponential rate. Archiving and curating these data for further research and analysis is a large challenge. Typically these data are stored as 4-byte real variables in the form of physical field variables in four dimensional spatio-temporal grids. Many of the existing lossy and non-lossy algorithms do not take full advantage of the uniform or nearly-uniform variation of these physical variables over spatio-temporal grids. We develop and implement an algorithm that compresses chunks of these physical variables in spatio-temporal domains to take advantage of this uniformity. One of the important features of this implementation is that it allows user to control the extent of spatio-temporal chunks, which can be tuned to maximize the compression factor. A second important feature is to be able to provide the capability to fine-tune the precision of the stored physical variables, according to the data type requirements. For example, we note that the climatological analysis involves averaging over field variables that in turn makes some insignificant bits of data irrelevant to the final result -- in our scheme users will be able to control the number of bits to be stored. In order to be able to compress further, we pass the stream through a lossless LZMA scheme. The amount of compression that can be achieved by this scheme depends on the uniformity of data and the required number of significant bits of information. We will report the compression factor that can be obtained when this package is applied for a wide range of climate variables with the constraint of keeping the climate analysis results statistically indistinguishable by following the analysis of Baker et.al.[1].\n[1] A.H.

            "abstract": "The global structure of the heliosphere during solar cycles (SC) 23 and 24 differed significantly in many ways, for example in terms of global magnetic field strength, velocity structure and the observed properties of Stream Interaction Region (SIR) and associated shocks. The differences considered in this study focus primarily on the effects of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of SIRs. During the minimum of SC 24, equatorial coronal holes were prevalent as sources of low-latitude high-speed solar wind. In contrast, the canonical depiction of SC 23's minimum wind configuration is of a band of slow wind undulating about the heliographic equator. Using the heliospheric adaptation of the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model (LFM-helio), we have run simulations for two idealized global solar wind conditions. The first simulation approximates the classical tilted dipole, with fast solar wind at high latitudes and a band of slow wind tilted with respect to the heliographic equator, and the second consists of global slow solar wind with equatorial circular sources of high-speed streams. The evolution of the SIRs from 0.1 AU to 2.0 AU is characterized using the amplitude and location of the maximum compressions of the plasma and the magnetic field as well as the largest deflection of solar wind flow. The relation between plasma and magnetic field compressions differs between the two cases considered. The SIRs produced by the equatorial coronal holes have similar maximum densities to those of the tilted dipole case, but the magnetic field magnitude is larger and the plasma is hotter. This suggests that evolution depends on the 3D structure of the SIR and its effects on the competitive roles of the growth of the structure, driven by compression from dynamic pressure, and and relaxation from the plasma flow and magnetic field deflections occurring in the region. Magnetic field threading SIRs and tracing plasma parcels are examined.",

            "abstract": "The disparity between watershed erosion rates and downstream sediment delivery has been an important theme in geomorphology for many decades, with the role of floodplains in sediment storage as a frequent focus. In the Piedmont province of the eastern US, post-settlement upland deforestation and agricultural land use led to accumulation of thick packages of overbank sediment (\"legacy deposits\") in valley bottoms. Previous authors have argued that legacy sediment is a potentially important source of sediment being remobilized by lateral migration of channels. We seek to address 1) How rapidly sediment is remobilized from floodplains by channel migration and bank erosion, 2) the proportion of streambank sediment derived from legacy sediment, and 3) the potential contributions of net stream bank erosion and legacy sediments to downstream sediment yields within the Piedmont of Baltimore County, Maryland. We measured gross erosion and deposition rates over 45 years within the fluvial corridor along 30 valley segments from 18 watersheds with drainage areas between 0.18 and 155 km2 by comparing channel and floodplain morphology from LiDAR-based digital elevation data collected in 2005 with channel positions recorded on 1:2400-scale topographic maps from 1959-1961. Measured deposition within channel and point bars accounted for an average of 46% (28-75%) of gross erosion, with deposition increasingly important in larger drainages. Legacy sediments accounted for 6-90% of bank erosion at individual study segments, represented about 60% of bank height at most exposures, and accounted for 57% of the measured gross erosion. Extrapolating the results indicated that first- and second-order streams account for 62% of total stream bank erosion from northern Baltimore County. After accounting for estimated redeposition, extrapolated net stream bank sediment yields (72 Mg/km2/yr) are equivalent to 70% of average Piedmont watershed yield (104 Mg/km2/yr) cited in studies by previous authors. The results suggest stream bank sediments are a large source of sediment from Piedmont tributaries to the Chesapeake Bay. It is important to note that upland erosion rates have been reported with equivalent and greater magnitude for forested and cropland areas within the Maryland Piedmont (Gellis et al. 2009; Smith et al. 2011).",

            "abstract": "In tight shales, hydraulic fracturing is the dominant method for improving reservoir permeability. However, injecting water-based liquids can induce formation damage and disposal problems, thus other techniques are being sought. One alternative to hydraulic fracturing is producing fractures thermally, using low-temperature fluids (cryogens). The primary consequence of thermal stimulation is that shrinkage fractures are produced around the borehole wall. Recently, cryogenic stimulation produced some promising results when the cryogen (typically liquid nitrogen and cold nitrogen gas) could be brought to reservoir depth. Numerical modeling also showed possible significant increases in gas production from a shale reservoir after cryogenic stimulation. However, geometry and the dynamic behavior of these thermally induced fractures under different stress regimes and rock anisotropy and heterogeneity is not yet well understood.\nCurrently, we are conducting a series of laboratory thermal fracturing experiments on Mancos Shale and transparent glass blocks, by injecting liquid nitrogen under atmospheric pressure into room temperature blocks under various anisotropic stress states. The glass blocks allow clear optical visualization of fracture development and final fracturing patterns. For the shale blocks, X-ray CT is used to image both pre-existing and induced fractures. Also, the effect of borehole orientation with respect to the bedding planes and aligned preexisting fractures is examined.\nOur initial experiment on a uniaxially compressed glass block showed fracturing behavior which was distinctly different from conventional hydraulic fracturing. In addition to tensile fractures in the maximum principal stress directions, the thermal contraction by the cryogen induced (1) chaotic, spalling fractures around the borehole wall, and (2) a series of disk-shaped annular fractures perpendicular to the borehole. When applied to a horizontal borehole, the propagation plane of the latter fractures can be aligned with the maximum-and-intermediate stress plane, which allows creation of “seed” fractures for efficient, subsequent growth of borehole-perpendicular hydraulic fractures, without near-borehole perturbation on the fracture orientation.",

            "abstract": "Tree roots, particular those of old growth trees, provide significant cohesive strength that can prevent shallow landslides. Little is known about the root strength of trees growing in dry tropical forests. In 1997, Bahía de Caráquez, Ecuador experienced a large landslide, which may have been precipitated by massive deforestation along the Ecuadorian coast. We used a tensile spring apparatus combined with root maps to caclulate the cohesive strength of different native species of trees. Whereas the results show the previously reported power law relationship between root diameter and tensile strength, our data also reveals new contributions. First, we find that trees have far stronger and more abundant roots than neighboring bushes, and thus add far more cohesive strength to the hillslope. Furthermore, there is a wide range of tensile strength among the native trees measured, with algarrobo having the strongest roots, and ceibo gernally being weak rooted. Finally, we use a slope stability model to predict failure conditions considering the strength added to a hillslope if vegetation is predominantly composed of bushes, algarrobo, or ceibo. Our results, which are the first of their kind for the Ecuadorian dry tropical forest, will be used to guide the ongoing native reforestation efforts of Global Student Embassy. Our unique partnership with Global Student Embassy connects our field study to practical land use decisions that will lead to increased slope and decreased human danger along coastal Ecuador’s dry tropical forest.

            "abstract": "The southwestern United States is expected to become warmer and drier under future climate projections. The way in which plant and ecosystems respond to these changes is valuable for predicting carbon and water cycling, ecosystem resilience, phenology, and future agriculture, including biofuel production. We examined the interacting effects of dominant climate stressors--vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and temperature--on photosynthesis. Specifically, we tested whether or not plant production of the terpene isoprene imparts heat and water-stress tolerance. Within an experimental common garden of poplars (Populus) at University of Arizona’s Biosphere 2 we measured four separate genetic lines - two that retained isoprene production capacity and two that had this gene “knocked out”. VPD was altered at temperatures of 30, 35, and 40C to present both heat and aridity stresses. Maximum photosynthetic capacity (Amax), the VPD at which Amax occurred (VPDopt), and the VPD range between Amax and ninety percent of Amax (Ω90) were calculated to quantify how VPD differentially affected the lines. Amax was significantly lower in knockout lines than in control lines. Moreover, the difference in Amax between lines increased from 19.3% at 30C to 28.4% at 35C to 39.0% at 40C, indicating that trees without isoprene production are less equipped to handle hot and dry conditions. Ω90 and VPDopt response were not the same, though. Isoprene knockouts had significantly higher VPD optimums (1.9749 kPA vs. 1.6451 kPa) compared to isoprene-producing lines. Although maximum photosynthesis is diminished without isoprene production under water and heat stress, isoprene knockout lines were still fairly active at a high VPD and under a wide range of VPD conditions. Beyond advancing our basic understanding of plant ecophysiology, these results will inform the potential use of poplars as a source of biofuel production across a range of current and projected climate conditions.",

            "abstract": "The realization that well designed graphs and clearly worded summaries were not enough to spur the public and policy makers towards an appropriate understanding of our planet encouraged me to search for other ways to share climate stories with the general public. After co-authoring a popular book on food and climate change and giving many talks to the general public, it struck me that young people were largely missing from the dialogue, and little meaningful progress was being made to design effective solutions. I then started working with faculty and students from the Film and Animation Departments at San Jose State University to develop stories about climate change that would be engaging to younger audiences. The result was the Green Ninja Project, based around the Green Ninja, a superhero who focuses on solutions to climate change using humor and silliness to soften what can be a somewhat challenging topic. The Project includes a) The Green Ninja Show – a series of YouTube videos (over 1,000,000 views) highlighting actions young people can take to reduce climate change, b) The Green Ninja Film Festival where students tell their own climate solutions stories, and c) a collection of educational resources that help teachers bring climate science topics into their classroom using hands-on activities. A key component to this work is promoting social action experiences, so that young people can understand how their actions can make a difference. Based on these experiences, I will provide my own reflections on the challenges and opportunities of communicating climate change with young people.",

            "abstract": "Much as aircraft are affected by the prevailing winds and weather conditions in which they fly, satellites are affected by variability in the density and motion of the near earth space environment. Drastic changes in the neutral density of the thermosphere, caused by geomagnetic storms or other phenomena, result in perturbations of satellite motions through drag on the satellite surfaces. This can lead to difficulties in locating important satellites, temporarily losing track of satellites, and errors when predicting collisions in space. As the population of satellites in Earth orbit grows, higher space-weather prediction accuracy is required for critical missions, such as accurate catalog maintenance, collision avoidance for manned and unmanned space flight, reentry prediction, satellite lifetime prediction, defining on-board fuel requirements, and satellite attitude dynamics.\nWe describe ongoing work to build a comprehensive nowcast and forecast system for neutral density, winds, temperature, composition, and satellite drag. This modeling tool will be called the Atmospheric Density Assimilation Model (ADAM). It will be based on three state-of-the-art coupled models of the thermosphere-ionosphere running in real-time, using assimilative techniques to produce a thermospheric nowcast. It will also produce, in realtime, 72-hour predictions of the global thermosphere-ionosphere system using the nowcast as the initial condition.\nWe will review the requirements for the ADAM system, the underlying full-physics models, the plethora of input options available to drive the models, a feasibility study showing the performance of first-principles models as it pertains to satellite-drag operational needs, and review challenges in designing an assimilative space-weather prediction model. The performance of the ensemble assimilative model is expected to exceed the performance of current empirical and assimilative density models.",

            "abstract": "We present results on a near-global (80°S to 80°N) seven color Wide Angle Camera (WAC) photometric normalization and color analysis. Over 100,000 WAC color observations were calibrated to reflectance (radiance factor: IoF), and photometric angles (i,e,g), latitude, and longitude were calculated and stored for each WAC pixel. Photometric angles were calculated using the WAC GLD100 [1], and a six-dimensional data set (3 spatial and 3 photometric) was reduced to three by photometrically normalizing the IoF with a global wavelength-dependent, 3rd-order multivariate polynomial. The multispectral mosaic was normalized to a standard viewing geometry (incidence angle=30°, emission angle=0°, phase angle=30°).\nThe WAC has a 60° cross-track field-of-view in color mode, which allows the acquisition of a near global data set each month; however, the phase angle can change by as much as 60° across each image. These large changes in viewing geometry present challenges to the required photometric normalization. In the ratio of the 321 nm and 689 nm wavelengths, the Moon has a standard deviation less than 3% in the highlands and 7% globally; thus to allow confident identification of true color differences, the photometric normalization must be precise.\nPyroclastic deposits in Marius Hills, Sinus Aestuum, and Mare Serenitatis are among the least reflective materials, with 643 nm normalized reflectance values less than 0.036.\nLow-reflectance deposits are generally concentrated close to the equator on the nearside, whereas high-reflectance materials are dispersed globally. The highest reflectance materials occur at Giordano Bruno and Virtanen craters and are attributed to exposure of immature materials. Immature ejecta has shallower spectral slope compared to the mean highlands spectra (321 nm to 689 nm), and UV weathering characteristics can be seen when comparing different aged Copernican ejecta [2]. Copernican ejecta is found to have 643 nm reflectance values greater than 0.36 in some areas. The range of reflectance on the Moon is 10x from the least to most reflective.\nThe new empirical normalized reflectance presented here correlates with an independent Hapke model based normalization [3] with an R-squared value of 0.985.\n[1] Scholten et al.

Long-standing problems in hydrologic education include discontinuity of hydrologic topics from introductory to advanced courses, inconsistency of content across academic departments, and difficulties in development of laboratory and homework assignments utilizing large time series and spatial data sets. Hydrologic problems are typically not amenable to “back-of-the-chapter” examples. Local, long-term research watersheds offer solutions to these problems. Here, we describe our integration of research and monitoring programs in the Dry Creek Experimental Watershed into undergraduate and graduate hydrology programs at Boise State University. We developed a suite of watershed-based exercises into courses and curriculums using real, tangible datasets from the watershed to teach concepts not amenable to traditional textbook and lecture methods. The aggregation of exercises throughout a course or degree allows for scaffolding of concepts with progressive exposure of advanced concepts throughout a course or degree. The need for exercises of this type is growing as traditional lecture-based classes (passive learning from a local authoritative source) are being replaced with active learning courses that integrate many sources of information through situational factors.",

            "abstract": "Paleo channels, preserved on terraces via meander cutoffs during an incisional period, record the channel geometry and thus discharge throughout a river’s history. We measured paleochannel geometry on terraces throughout the Le Sueur River in south-central Minnesota, to track how channel geometry has changed throughout the last 13,400 years. A rapid drop in base level 13,400 yr B.P. triggered knickpoint migration and valley incision that is ongoing today. Since the 1800’s, the area has developed rapidly with an increase in agriculture and the amount of tile drainage, directly impacting river discharge by increasing water input to the river. Five paleochannels were identified on terraces along the Le Sueur River from 1m-resolution lidar data. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) was used to obtain a subsurface image across paleo-meanders to estimate the geometry of paleochannels. By measuring the geometry of paleochannels, we can compare the channel geometry and effective discharge at the time the terrace was being carved to today’s conditions. Three lines were run across each paleo-channel perpendicular to the historic water flow. Each of the 15 lines were “processed” using the EKKO Project 2 software supplied by Sensors and Software to sharpen the images, making it easier to identify the paleo channel geometry. OSL samples were collected from overbank deposits to determine the time of channel abandonment. Paleo discharge accompanied with depositional ages provide a history of flow conditions on the Le Sueur River. Preliminary results suggest the river channel has widened and increased in depth with time. This implies that the increase in agriculture and tile drainage since the area’s development has negatively impacted the Le Sueur River resulting in a change in channel morphometry more conducive to erosion along the bluffs and banks. This increase in erosion has directly impacted the amount of sediment delivered to the rivers from banks and bluffs, increasing the turbidity in this turbidity-impaired river system.",

Quantitative interpretation of seismicity and their comparison with measured geodetic strain rate can provide invaluable information to assess the seismic hazard potential in Iran. We used seismicity recoded by national (2006-Present) and international (1909- Present) networks as well as geodetic data (1999-2011) to compute seismic strain rate, variation in source strength (Potency), rock mass resistance to the flow of coseismic inelastic deformation (Seismic viscosity) and their correlation with measured geodetic strain rate.\nOur results suggest lower seismic strain rate along North Tabriz fault, central and NE Alborz and distinct areas in NE of Iran. These areas are associated with higher seismic viscosity suggesting quiescence time, however surrounded by lower seismic viscosity, which implies the easier flow of seismic inelastic deformation or greater stress transfer due to seismicity. Major historical earthquakes (more than 10 earthquakes with M>7, occurred before 1909) associated with suggested area in the northern Iran and the observed seismo-tectonic behavior may imply the potential seismic hazard in these regions.",

            "abstract": "Fault valving and transient fluid flow has long been suspected to be an important process in the earthquake cycle, but has not previously been captured by direct measurements during an episode. In particular, earthquakes are thought to drive fluids in fault zones, but again, evidence has been limited to the geologic record. Here we report on the signature of fluid pumping events inside the Tohoku Fault associated with individual earthquakes. As part of the Japan Trench Fast Drilling Project (JFAST), a sub-seafloor temperature observatory was installed across the plate boundary fault zone that ruptured during the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake. The observatory consisted of 55 autonomous temperature sensing dataloggers extending up to 820 m below sea floor at a water depth of ~7 km. The temporary deployment recorded data from July 2012 through April 2013. In addition to measuring the frictional heat signal from the megathrust earthquake, the high-resolution temperature time series data reveal spatially coherent temperature transients following regional earthquakes. Temperature increases vertically upwards from a fracture zone and decreases downwards, which is consistent with the expected signature of a pulse entering the annulus from the fracture zone. The anomalies are a few hundredths of degree Celsius and occur repeatedly at depths that are independently interpreted to have higher fracture permeability. High-pass filtered data are spatially correlated in areas disturbed by transient fluid advection. Fluid pulses occur in response to over a dozen local earthquakes, including a Mw 5.4 on 14 October 2012, a Mw 5.5 on 11 November 2012, and a doublet of two very local Mw 7.2 intraplate earthquakes on 7 December 2012, along with its associated aftershocks. There does not appear to be a response to large far-field earthquakes such as the 28 October 2012 Mw 7.8 Haida Gwaii or 6 February 2013 Mw 8.0 Santa Cruz Islands earthquakes.\nThese measurements provide the first in situ documentation of seismic pumping at fractured regions of the fault damage zone. Near fault measurements such as these may provide insight into drivers of earthquake occurrence. The redistribution of fluid pressures within fault zones, such as observed here in response to earthquakes, is a potential mechanism that may be involved in earthquake triggering.",

The goals of this project included strengthening the partnership between the two countries, and building relationships between future generations of scientists, while developing the students’ awareness of global scientific issues and expanding their knowledge and interest in Antarctica and polar science. A big component of the project involved the sharing by students of the acquired knowledge and experiences with the general public.\nJASE is based on the successful Chilean Antarctic Science Fair developed by Chile´s Antarctic Research Institute. For 10 years, small groups of Chilean students, each mentored by a teacher, perform experimental or bibliographical Antarctic research. Winning teams are awarded an expedition to the Chilean research station on King George Island. In 2014, the Chileans invited US participation in this program in order to strengthen science ties for upcoming generations.\nOn King George Island, students have hands-on experiences conducting experiments and learning about field research. While the total number of students directly involved in the program is relatively small, the sharing of the experience by students with the general public is a novel approach to science education.\nResearch experiences for students, like JASE, are important as they influence new direction for students in science learning, science interest, and help increase science knowledge. We will share experiences with the planning of the pilot program as well as the expedition itself. We also share the results of the assessment report prepared by an independent party. Lastly, we will offer recommendations for initiating international science education collaborations.\nUnited States participation was funded by the NSF Division of Polar Programs.",

            "abstract": "The question of how biological diversity influences the functioning of ecosystems has been of interest for decades and represents one of the grand challenge questions in ecology. In terrestrial ecosystems, most of the work on this topic has come from grasslands and other systems dominated by low stature vegetation that can be experimentally manipulated. Mature forests present a challenge because the size and lifespans of trees make it difficult to conduct manipulative diversity experiments. Although some studies have focused on previously established plantation forests, these opportunities are limited and often don’t coincide with measurements of whole-ecosystem function. The accumulation of data from eddy covariance networks provides a unique opportunity in that the growing temporal coverage over a large number of sites should eventually make it feasible to examine the influence of diversity using statistical, as opposed to experimental, approaches. Here, we present early results from an effort to examine ecosystem fluxes of carbon and water in relation to forest canopy diversity in North American Temperate forests. We combine traditional metrics of species diversity with measures of spectral diversity from aircraft remote sensing and compare these with indices of ecosystem function related to carbon assimilation, water use efficiency and resistance to climate variability. Results are presented with respect to several theories of diversity and ecosystem function and we discuss challenges that need to be overcome to further the relevance of flux networks to this important area of ecological theory.",

            "abstract": "Our goal is to investigate possible sources of predictability of hydrometeorological extreme events in the Northern High Plains. Hydrometeorological extreme events are considered the most costly natural phenomena. Water deficits and surpluses highlight how the water-climate interdependence becomes crucial in areas where single activities drive economies such as Agriculture in the NHP. Nonetheless we recognize the Water-Climate interdependence and the regulatory role that human activities play, we still grapple to identify what sources of predictability could be added to flood and drought forecasts. To identify the benefit of multi-scale climate modeling and the role of initial conditions on flood and drought predictability on the NHP, we use the Ocean Land Atmospheric Model (OLAM). OLAM is characterized by a dynamic core with a global geodesic grid with hexagonal (and variably refined) mesh cells and a finite volume discretization of the full compressible Navier Stokes equations, a cut-grid cell method for topography (that reduces error in computational gradient computation and anomalous vertical dispersion). Our hypothesis is that wet conditions will drive OLAM’s simulations of precipitation to wetter conditions affecting both flood forecast and drought forecast. To test this hypothesis we simulate precipitation during identified historical flood events followed by drought events in the NHP (i.e. 2011-2012 years). We initialized OLAM with CFS-data 1-10 days previous to a flooding event (as initial conditions) to explore (1) short-term and high-resolution and (2) long-term and coarse-resolution simulations of flood and drought events, respectively. While floods are assessed during a maximum of 15-days refined-mesh simulations, drought is evaluated during the following 15 months. Simulated precipitation will be compared with the Sub-continental Observation Dataset, a gridded 1/16th degree resolution data obtained from climatological stations in Canada, US, and Mexico. This in-progress research will ultimately contribute to integrate OLAM and VIC models and improve predictability of extreme hydrometeorological events.",

Analysis of turbulent flux calculations from the site has shown a disproportionate contribution to the energy budget from episodic events such as cold frontal passages. Over the last two years the flux site, which is 2 km from the nearest shoreline, has been complemented by an automated weather station on nearby land, occasional mobile observations, and water quality measurements. These observations together comprise the Coordinated Mesoscale Measurements in Mississippi (CM3) framework, which is planned to also include unmanned aerial systems for 3-dimensional sampling over the reservoir. Mesoscale variability of turbulent flux forcing and responses over and in the vicinity of the reservoir are being evaluated for both strongly forced (e.g. cold fronts, thunderstorms) and quiescent scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Drylands are an important component of the global carbon (C) cycle, accounting for 40% of the land area and 20% of the soil organic C globally. Litter decomposition is a key biogeochemical process, controlling C and nutrient cycling. While simple decomposition models successfully predict decomposition rates in many systems based on climate variables, there is a disconnect between the modeled and measured rates decomposition in drylands. This disconnect may stem from abiotic factors of importance in drylands, such as photodegradation and soil-litter mixing, not being taken into account. Soil-litter mixing can accelerate decomposition, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Potential mechanisms include microclimate buffering, physical abrasion, and enhanced microbial colonization. Recent work suggests that litter decomposition is remarkably insensitive to climate variables, at least when variables are presented as long temporal-scale values (e.g., annual precipitation). We hypothesized that decomposition would be more strongly affected by litter moisture content than total precipitation (PPT) alone. Thus, frequent, small PPT pulses would accelerate decomposition more than larger, but infrequent pulses. Furthermore, soil-litter mixing would enhance decomposition by buffering litter moisture content. To test the combined influence of soil-litter mixing and PPT pulses on decomposition, we incubated litter and soil in a semi-controlled greenhouse which simulated dryland summer temperatures. Two litter types (grass and shrub) were incubated under two levels of soil-litter mixing (no mixing and complete soil-litter mixing) and with 16 different PPT treatments (a factorial combination of four PPT pulses sizes and four PPT frequencies). We measured instantaneous CO2 flux throughout the 30 day incubation and mass loss at the end of the incubation. Shrub litter decomposed faster than grass litter. Flux rates generally peaked at day 8 and declined thereafter. CO2 flux rates were largely a function of time since last PPT pulse, with more stable CO2 flux rates for more frequent pulses than infrequent pulses. Soil-litter mixing altered responses to PPT pulses. Together, these data support the idea that decomposition is more related to stability of litter moisture than total long-term PPT.",

The DMB measures temperature, pressure, and relative humidity as it descends through the atmosphere. Once it lands on the ocean’s surface, it deploys a string of sensors that measures temperature and salinity of the upper three meters of the ocean. The ocean sensors telemeter data back to the UAS on subsequent flights. The DMB can also be dropped on an ice flow to measure the rate of the ice movement. The DMB collect and store data and then transmit the data back to the UAS when it comes overhead. The NOAA/PMEL aerosol payload has been expanded to include a printed optical particle spectrometer to obtain aerosol size distributions and an upward looking radiometer to measure radiant flux densities through aerosol layers. Details of these payloads and example data will be reported.",

Across the eastern half of the section, starting from the Peru Margin and spanning the Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ), attention was paid to not only the standard hydrographic sensors but also the fluorometer and dissolved oxygen sensors interfaced to the CTD, for example to select depths associated with the chlorophyll maximum in the uppermost water column and also the underlying low oxygen waters which formed a primary focus for sampling to investigate redox-cycling within the OMZ. In the western half of the section, attention turned toward the extensive hydrothermal plume which was first intercepted directly above the southern East Pacific Rise ridge axis near 15°S. There, the depth and intensity of the hydrothermal plume was revealed by a combination of the standard sensor suite interfaced to the CTD/rosette, augmented with an Oxygen Reduction Potential (ORP) probe provided by NOAA-PMEL and a SeaPoint optical back scatter sensor provided by WHOI. Thorough on-board salinity, dissolved oxygen, and nutrient analyses provided key data for CTD calibration, quality control and hydrographic interpretation including clear evidence for dissolved phosphate scavenging in the near-field hydrothermal plume. We will compare the EPZT CTD/hydrographic data with WOCE-era (1991-1994) sections including zonal section P21, which parallels the new transect, and crossovers with WOCE meridional sections P16, P17, P18, and P19.",

            "abstract": "Best management practices (BMPs) generally focus on retaining nutrients (especially P) after they enter the watershed. This approach is expensive, unsustainable, and has not led to reductions of P pollution at large scales (e.g., Mississippi River). Although source reduction, which results in reducing inputs of nutrients to a watershed, has long been cited as a preferred approach, we have not had tools to guide source reduction efforts at the watershed level. To augment conventional TMDL tools, we developed an “actionable” watershed P balance approach, based largely on watershed–specific information, yet simple enough to be utilized as a practical tool. Interviews with farmers were used to obtain detailed farm management data, data from livestock permits were adjusted based on site visits, stream P fluxes were calculated from 3 years of monitoring data, and expert knowledge was used to model P fluxes through animal operations. The overall P use efficiency. Puse was calculated as the sum of deliberate exports (P in animals, milk, eggs, and crops) divided by deliberate inputs (P inputs of fertilizer, feed, and nursery animals x 100. The crop P use efficiency was 1.7, meaning that more P was exported as products that was deliberately imported; we estimate that this mining would have resulted in a loss of 6 mg P/kg across the watershed. Despite the negative P balance, the equivalent of 5% of watershed input was lost via stream export. Tile drainage, the presence of buffer strips, and relatively flat topography result in dominance of P loads by ortho-P (66%) and low particulate P. This, together with geochemical analysis (ongoing) suggest that biological processes may be at least as important as sediment transport in controlling P loads. We have developed a P balance calculator tool to enable watershed management organizations to develop watershed P balances and identify opportunities for improving the efficiency of P utilization.",

However, open ended assignments that allow students the freedom to personalize their projects present an opportunity to teach the universal functionality of GIS, as well as stimulate curiosity of students from all backgrounds by allowing them to tailor a project to their personal interests. During an introductory GIS course at the University of California, San Diego, projects prompted students to utilize ArcGIS in ways of their choice that raised awareness of local environmental issues, as well as encouraged students to incorporate environmentally sustainable practices into their lives. In view of the frequently stated interest of students to enter careers where they can use their newly learned GIS skills, the educational platform of choice is ESRI's ArcGIS, but the choice of platform remains flexible. As GIS resources become more accessible with the development of programs such as OpenGIS and OpenStreetMap, the potential for GIS to effectively communicate environmental issues to the public is growing fast.

            "abstract": "The northern Californian Coast ranges present a unique area to study landscape response to transient tectonic uplift. Studies have shown that an increase in uplift may be balanced by the rate of landsliding in settings of steady uplift. However, the landsliding response to transient tectonic uplift remains to be elucidated. The Californian Coast ranges are shaped by the northward migration of the Mendocino Triple Junction (MTJ), which geodynamic modeling suggests produces a transient double-humped uplift field. A major research question is whether we can detect a signature of this transient tectonic uplift in landslide activity and document how the channel network communicates this signal to hillslopes.\nUsing air photos and Worldview imagery, we manually mapped more than 2000 earthflows and debris slides in the Eel and surrounding catchments that span the ~400 km-long region. The velocities of active earthflows were estimated by visually tracking features between images spanning 1993 to 2013. We mapped channel steepness from 10m NED DEMs in Topotoolbox 2 and developed a new tool to automatically define knickpoints along the channel network.\nEarthflows occur almost exclusively in a band of Franciscan mélange oriented along the MTJ transect whilst debris slides are more evenly distributed by lithology. Both earthflows and debris slides are clustered in the Eel catchment around the proposed uplift peaks and are largely absent outside of these zones. Within these areas of high landslide densities, we observe peaks in active earthflows adjacent to peaks in dormant earthflows to the south, suggesting that the signature of earthflow activity remains for a period of time once the uplift peak has passed. Landslide density, mean landslide area, and earthflow velocity all increase rapidly above threshold values of channel steepness and local relief. In the Eel catchment, where the zone of rapid uplift is commencing, landslides, particularly earth flows, are concentrated below an elevation band bracketed by knickpoints that we suggest reflects a wave of incision sweeping upstream from the outlet. We suggest that landslide activity upstream of this zone of adjusting topography may reflect a more complex response to the passage of the uplift peak that causes tilting and internal steepening of the headwaters.",

The Delta is simultaneously the most critical component of California’s water supply, a primary focus of the state’s ecological conservation measures, and a vital resource deeply imperiled by degraded water quality. Delta waterbodies are identified as impaired by salinity, excess nutrients, low dissolved oxygen, pathogens, pesticides, heavy metals, and other contaminants. Climate change is expected to exacerbate the impacts of existing stressors in the Delta and magnify the challenges of managing this natural resource. A clear understanding of the current state of the watershed is needed to better inform scientists, decision makers, and the public about potential impacts from climate change. The Delta Watershed Initiative Network (Delta WIN) leverages the ecological benefits of healthy watersheds, and enhances, expands and creates opportunities for greater watershed health by coordinating with agencies, established programs, and local organizations. At this critical junction, Delta WIN is coordinating data integration and analysis to develop better understanding of the existing and emerging water quality concerns. As first steps, Delta WIN is integrating existing water quality data, analyzing trends, and monitoring to fill data gaps and to evaluate indicators of climate change impacts. Available data will be used for trend analysis; Delta WIN will continue to monitor where data is incomplete and new questions arise. Understanding how climate change conditions may affect water quality will be used to inform efforts to build resilience and maintain water quality levels which sustain aquatic life and human needs. Assessments of historical and new data will aid in recognition of potential climate change impacts and in initiating implementation of best management practices in collaboration with State and local agencies. Ultimately, Delta WIN can inform responsive science and adaptive management in other estuaries and critical natural resource areas facing times of change.",

At the large (>300 km) scale, convective rainfall is correlated with surface wind convergence in the model and scatterometer measurements. At smaller scales resolved by the model, convective rainfall is correlated with surface wind divergence, due to cold pools and their associated gust fronts, while the scatterometer measurements only hint at this scale transition. The next generation microwave scatterometer/radiometer combination will allow systematic study of the surface wind-rainfall relationship in these mesoscale convective systems. ",

            "abstract": "Under the Agricultural Model Inter-Comparison program (AgMIP), climate change projections for Sri Lanka were undertaken from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP5) archives for five locations covering Sri Lanka. These datasets were first quality checked after removing questionable data entries. The gaps in data were filled using AgMERRA data set for the specific location developed by Alex Ruane and Sonali McDermid at NASA- GISS after applying the necessary bias corrections. Future climate projections for 2040- 2070 are based on projections for high Carbon Dioxide emissions (RCP8.5). Analysis was undertaken on the outputs of 20 General Circulation Models (GCMs). Observed climate datasets (for the period 1980- 2010) for each location were used to generate downscaled future predictions. Future projections for maximum temperature, minimum temperature and rainfall were generated while holding solar radiation constant and changing the CO2 value up to 499 ppm. Results for 5 GCMs that simulate the monsoon region best were then selected for further analysis. These are CCSM4, GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, MIROC5, MPI-ESM-MR.\nAll 20 GCM outputs predicted that both minimum and maximum temperature shall rise by around 2 ⁰C throughout the year. This result is consistent across all 5 locations and the uncertainty associated with this prediction was observed to be low compared to that of rainfall. In the case of the rainfall, majority (80- 95%) of GCMs predicted an increment in the annual rainfall by around 0.5 mm/day. Rainfall during September- October- November was predicted to have a high increment (around 2- 7 mm/day) and during February- March a decrement of around 1- 2 mm/day was predicted. The uncertainty of this prediction based on outputs of all 20 GCMs were observed to be high. These results are consistent with the Fourth Assessment Report by the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change.",

            "abstract": "Benthic foraminifera compose the dominant biota in the central Peruvian margin, which is impinged by an intense Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ). Here subsurface and benthic biogeochemical conditions are characterized by oxygen deficiency in the bottom waters, strong fluxes of settling organic matter and reducing conditions in the surface sediments. These processes interact among each other and are amplified or relaxed according to the variability of oceanic conditions at different spatial and temporal scales. Recent studies on living foraminiferal assemblages determined the association of species to a geochemical condition (in terms of redox and organic matter (OM)). Species such as Bolivina costata, Nonionella auris and Virgulinella fragilis were characteristic of sulphidic/labile OM-rich sediments, whereas Bolivina pacifica headed the assemblage representative of postoxia (no oxygen, non sulphidic)/preserved OM.\nThe present study aims to reconstruct the decadal to multidecadal variation of benthic paleo-redox conditions for the last two centuries, based on laminated sedimentary records of benthic foraminiferal assemblages and redox-sensitive metals (Mo, Re, etc.) in the upper margin off Callao (12°S). Three major multidecadal periods were determined for the record: i) the mid to late nineteenth century, characterized by the occurrence of massive diatom-rich sedimentation events, development of bottom anoxia, and higher abundance of Bolivina costata and Nonionella auris; ii) the late nineteenth century to mid-twentieth century, featuring interdecadal variations of redox conditions; and iii) the late twentieth century until the early 2000’s, in which redox-sensitive metal records exhibit a trend towards less reducing conditions, accompanied by higher relative abundances of postoxia foraminiferal species (e.g. Bolivina pacifica or Bolivina plicata). Remarkably, the first multidecadal period is associated with a higher ENSO activity, whereas the latest one is parallel to the period of coastal cooling and increasing fluxes of productivity proxies. Our findings suggest that besides export productivity, the upper margin benthic redox states are modulated by vertical mixing and/or subsurface ventilation.",

            "abstract": "Schools on Canada’s west coast and in the Canadian Arctic are participating in the pilot year of a novel educational program based on analyzing, understanding and sharing ocean data collected by cabled observatories. The core of the program is “local observations, global connections.” First, students develop an understanding of ocean conditions at their doorstep through the analysis of community-based observatory data. Then, they connect that knowledge with the health of the global ocean by engaging with students at other schools participating in the educational program and through supplemental educational resources.\nOcean Networks Canada (ONC), an initiative of the University of Victoria, operates cabled ocean observatories which supply continuous power and Internet connectivity to a broad suite of subsea instruments from the coast to the deep sea. This Internet connectivity permits researchers, students and members of the public to download freely available data on their computers anywhere around the globe, in near real-time.\nIn addition to the large NEPTUNE and VENUS cabled observatories off the coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, ONC has been installing smaller, community-based cabled observatories. Currently two are installed: one in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut and one at Brentwood College School, on Mill Bay in Saanich Inlet, BC. Several more community-based observatories are scheduled for installation within the next year. The observatories support a variety of subsea instruments, such as a video camera, hydrophone and water quality monitor and shore-based equipment including a weather station and a video camera.\nSchools in communities hosting an observatory are invited to participate in the program, alongside schools located in other coastal and inland communities. Students and teachers access educational material and data through a web portal, and use video conferencing and social media tools to communicate their findings. A series of lesson plans introduces the teachers and students to cabled observatory technology and instrumentation, including technical aspects and their value in monitoring changing ocean conditions.\nThis presentation will describe the program in more detail and report on our experiences in the first months of the pilot year.",

            "abstract": "The AmeriFlux network gathers, curates, and publishes data collected by independently managed field sites measuring fluxes of carbon, water, and energy across the Americas. The data are processed into fluxes and quality controlled by individual tower teams and sent to the network for publication. After further data quality control, these data go through a series of post-processing steps to generate derived and value-added data products. In this presentation we describe these steps and discusses our approach in combining them into a consistent and reproducible processing pipeline that is being used to generate a new release of these data products. The first involves two Ustar threshold calculation approaches, namely the Moving Point Test (MPT) and the Change Point Detection (CPD) approaches. Based on a combination of bootstrapping and these two Ustar threshold calculation methods, an ensemble of Ustar thresholds are generated. The values in this ensemble are all used for Ustar filtering and also to generate an uncertainty estimation. A model efficiency comparison approach is used to select reference values for both the Ustar threshold and the net ecosystem exchange (NEE). The next step takes care of gapfilling of micro-meteorological variables using a combination of the Marginal Distribution Sampling (MDS) method for shorter gaps and, for longer gaps, downscaled data based on the ERA Interim data products, harmonized to the data from each site. In the next step, two methods are used to gapfill the NEE and energy fluxes: the first based on the MDS method and the second based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Another step is the partitioning of NEE into ecosystem respiration and gross primary production (GPP). This step is currently using two methods: one based on nighttime data (using a respiration model) and another on daytime data (using respiration and photosynthesis models). The final step involves a calculation of uncertainties, the determination of reference data products for some of the variables, the computation of their uncertainty values, and the aggregation to other temporal scales (e.g., monthly and yearly). This work is being developed in close collaboration with European partners from ICOS, and is being used to generate new versions of the global flux data products for FLUXNET.",

            "abstract": "Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) may be produced in natural waters via photochemical reactions between dissolved oxygen, organic carbon and light. Other reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide and hydroxyl radicals are potentially formed in environments with high concentrations of ferrous iron (Fe(II), ~10-100 µM) by reaction between H2O2 and Fe(II) (i.e., Fenton chemistry). Thermophilic archaea and bacteria inhabiting acidic iron-oxide mats have defense mechanisms against both extracellular and intracellular peroxide, such as peroxiredoxins (which can degrade H2O2) and against other ROS, such as superoxide dismutases. Biological cycling of H2O2 is not well understood in geothermal ecosystems, and geochemical measurements combined with molecular investigations will contribute to our understanding of microbial response to oxidative stress. We measured H2O2 and other dissolved compounds (Fe(II), Fe(III), H2S, O2), as well as photon flux, pH and temperature, over time in surface geothermal waters of several acidic springs in Norris Geyser Basin, Yellowstone National Park, WY (Beowulf Spring and One Hundred Spring Plain). Iron-oxide mats were sampled in Beowulf Spring for on-going analysis of metatranscriptomes and RT-qPCR assays of specific stress-response gene transcription (e.g., superoxide dismutases, peroxiredoxins, thioredoxins, and peroxidases). In situ analyses show that H2O2 concentrations are lowest in the source waters of sulfidic systems (ca. 1 μM), and increase by two-fold in oxygenated waters corresponding to Fe(III)-oxide mat formation (ca. 2 - 3 μM). Channel transects confirm increases in H2O2 as a function of oxygenation (distance). The temporal dynamics of H2O2, O2, Fe(II), and H2S in Beowulf geothermal waters were also measured during a diel cycle, and increases in H2O2 were observed during peak photon flux. These results suggest that photochemical reactions may contribute to changes in H2O2. We hypothesize that increases in H2O2 and O2 concentrations in iron-oxidizing habitats will induce higher transcription rates of genes responsible for H2O2 degradation and O2 respiration. Subsequent measurements of additional ROS and analysis of transcript data will provide broader insight on the interactions and metabolic response within iron mat communities under oxidative stress.",

            "abstract": "Conjunctive observations of low-Earth-orbit satellites and optical auroral imagers have indicated that, a majority of pulsating auroral patches (PAPs) are associated with low-energy ion (LEI) precipitation structures with core energies ranging from several tens of eV up to a few hundred eV. This result is consistent with a long-standing proposal that the PAPs connect to flux tubes filled with enhanced “cold” plasma. To further explore the origin and generation mechanism of those LEI structures, we investigate a few THEMIS events when the in-situ probes are conceived as conjugate to PAPs, judging by an apparent correlation between the in-situ whistler-mode chorus and the oscillation of the PAP luminosity [Nishimura et al., 2011]. We notice a common existence of LEI structures from THEMIS in-situ data during those conjugacy event intervals. Such LEI structures are always strongly field-aligned, with core energies ranging from several tens of eV up to a few hundred eV, and often exhibit distinct energy dispersion features. Contingent upon the energy range and time, the pitch-angle distribution of the LEI structures can be either heavily biased toward parallel direction, or biased toward anti-parallel direction, or roughly symmetric between parallel and anti-parallel directions. The above observations allude to the ion outflows from the ionosphere as a plausible origin of the observed LEI structures. To check the above notion, we perform particle simulations assuming that the low-energy ions originate from the ion outflows in topside ionosphere and bounce between hemispheres while convecting with EXB drift. The simulation results can reproduce some of the basic observable features of the LEI structures, such as the energy dispersion and the variation of pitch-angle distribution versus time and energy. Combining the results from low-Earth-orbit satellites observations, THEMIS in-situ observations, and simulations, we propose that the ion outflows into the magnetosphere can fill the flux tubes with low-energy plasma structure which, along with coherent dimension of the whistler-mode chorus and high-energy electron precipitation, control the spatial size of the PAP.",

            "abstract": "Chronic erosion dominates sandy beaches of Hawaii causing loss and beach narrowing; and damaging homes, infrastructure, and critical habitat. Increased rates of sea level rise (SLR) will likely exacerbate these problems. Shoreline managers and other stakeholders need guidance to support long-range planning and adaptation efforts. Despite recent advances in sophisticated numerical models, there remains a need for simple approaches to estimating land areas that are threatened by erosion on decadal-to-century time scales due to SLR. While not as detailed as numerical models, empirical approaches can provide a first-order approximation to shoreline change that may be useful for coastal management and planning. Shoreline managers in Hawaii commonly work with historical data to provide information on coastal erosion. Simple linear regression methods have been especially attractive in Hawaii, where complex reef topography can cause high spatial variability in sediment transport patterns. Yet, facing projected future increases in the rate of SLR, extrapolating historical trends is insufficient. Predictions of shoreline change with SLR commonly employ controversial geometric models (e.g., the Bruun Model) that do not account for sediment availability and alongshore variability captured in historical data. Furthermore, these two projections often produce conflicting results. We report here on the early results of mapping probability-based erosion hazard areas, determined by combining the extrapolated historical shoreline change model with a geometric model of shoreline response (Davidson-Arnott, 2005) to strictly accelerated SLR. A geographic information system is used to explore the intersection between potential erosion hazards, coastal geology, and development patterns. This approach is attractive because it is simple and utilizes existing datasets. Yet, its simplicity implies broad assumptions of the coastal system and leads to large uncertainty in projections. To investigate the applicability of such an approach and identify management needs, erosion hazard areas are projected at various time intervals and confidence levels for ten Hawaii beaches.\nRef.: Davidson-Arnott, R.

It also has the lowest ionization threshold so is the terminal ion in the ionospheric E-region. Solar soft X-ray energy between 0.1 and 7 nm is absorbed mostly in the lower thermosphere between 100 and 150 km. Photoelectrons are created and initiate chains of photochemical reactions which leads to the production of nitric oxide (NO). On the other hand, solar irradiance longer than 150 nm destroys NO. In this study, observation of the local-time variation of NO abundance in the lower thermosphere is derived from the Remote Atmospheric and Ionospheric Detection System (RAIDS) measurements in summer 2010. Soft X-ray and EUV irradiance from the Extreme ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE) on the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) is used to drive the NOx1D model during the same period of time. By comparing variation of NO abundance at local sunlit hours, the effects of solar irradiance on thermospheric NO photochemistry in the model are examined.",

            "abstract": "On June 23, 2014 at 20:53:07 GMT, a Mw = 7.9 earthquake struck the Rat Islands region of Alaska in the central Aleutians. This is one of the most seismically active areas on earth, where the Pacific plate is subducted beneath the North American plate at a rate of nearly 6 centimeters per year. Prior to June 23, the most recent significant earthquake in this region was a Mw = 7.7 earthquake that ruptured up-dip on the Aleutian interface in 2003. Great earthquakes ruptured most of the megathrust in this region in 1957 and 1965. Unlike these events, the June 23 earthquake appears to have been intraslab, rupturing the down-going Pacific plate at moderate depth with a normal sense of faulting. By mid-July 2014, the Alaska Earthquake Center had located in excess of 1500 aftershocks from this event using broad-band instruments from the regional network as well as short-period sensors from local volcano monitoring arrays. More than 40 aftershocks were larger than ml = 4, with the largest being an Mw = 6.6 event that occurred in the over-riding North American plate. We used a double-difference relocation method and a regional velocity model to investigate the spatial distribution of aftershocks. Relocated seismicity delineates a narrow plane dipping to the northwest, the dimensions of which suggest that a large stress drop may have been necessary to achieve the moment release reported by the Global Centroid Moment Tensor Project. Comparing the relocated seismicity distribution to preliminary slip models from the United States Geological Survey indicated that aftershock locations correlate well with areas between asperities, where there is a transition from areas of high slip to areas of low slip. We also computed the Coulomb stress change induced by the coseismic slip in order to explore the possibility of static triggering of aftershocks. Preliminary indications are that aftershocks do not appear to be preferentially located in areas of enhanced stress.",

With more than 40 low-mass planets (with masses less than 10 earth-masses) with measured masses and radii, it is now possible to distinguish trends in the data. Although most of these planets have a substantial envelope that makes them closer in nature to Uranus and Neptune, there are about 10 low-mass exoplanets that are potentially rocky. Despite the uncertainties in the data (especially in the mass), it is becoming evident that there is variety in compositions expressed mostly in a wide range of Fe/Si ratios that may affect the interior dynamics and thermal evolution of these planets. In addition, numerous observing campaigns have targeted M stars to find super-Earths in the habitable zone, as this region is closer to the host star. It is well recognized that these planets may also be subjected to variable amounts of early and/or sustained tidal heating. This may in turn affect the mode of convection and outgassing of these planets. I will present results on the lessons learned from the super-Earth data and the implications of variable Fe/Si ratio and tidal heating for the dynamics of the interior using the model by [1] including a simple degassing model for water.\n[1] Tackley, P.

            "abstract": "Stable isotope hydrology offers a method to partition evapotranspiration (ET) into its components evaporation (E) and transpiration (T). Our objective is to test a mass balance equation, presented by Wenninger et al. (2010), to evaluate the relative contributions of E and T to ET retrospectively based on stable isotope profile signatures in soil. We tested the approach under controlled laboratory conditions and in a heterogeneous, sagebrush-steppe ecosystem where microsites vary in contributions of T to vapor efflux. This presentation describes the theoretical and experimental approach to this study, along with an assessment of the approach under a simplified, purely evaporative condition in the lab, in which we asked whether the equation would correctly confirm that ET was entirely attributable to E.\nIndependent soil microcosms were created such that only the upward movement of water was allowed. Under constant radiation and wind, the soil water contents and corresponding isotopic composition of water were evaluated after wetting to field capacity and after a period of E. Under these conditions, the equation can be simplified to the evaporated fraction being equal to the initial liquid product minus the final, divided by the composition of the vapor. Water isotopes were measured using the liquid-vapor equilibration method and laser spectroscopy. Mean soil water across the profiles increased in d18O by 2‰, and the effluxing vapor was 5‰ depleted. Soil water decreased to 70% of field capacity. From these preliminary data the equation verified all (99%) vapor efflux was E. Using a similar approach in the field setting, we have observed greater variability in soil profiles. Factors affecting the performance and testing of this approach in the field will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "We analyze the volumetric sensitivity of fault zone seismic head and trapped waves by constructing finite-frequency Fréchet kernels for these phases using idealized and tomographically-derived seismic velocity models of fault zones. We first validate numerical calculations by waveform comparisons with analytical results for two idealized fault zone models: a vertical bimaterial interface separating two solids of differing elastic properties, and a ‘vertical sandwich’ in which a vertical low velocity zone is surrounded on either side by higher velocity media. After establishing numerical accuracy up to 10 Hz, we construct models of the San Jacinto Fault Zone (SJFZ) using previous detailed tomographic results, including versions with explicit fault zone boundary interfaces. We compare numerical waveform calculations with observed data for the Southern California Seismic Network and the Anza seismic network. We construct P and S velocity sensitivity kernels for different seismic phases observed in the SJFZ and idealized models. In contrast to P body waves, which have little or no sensitivity to fault zone structure, the sensitivity kernels for head waves have sharp peaks with high values near the fault in the faster medium. Surface wave kernels show the broadest spatial distribution of sensitivity, while trapped wave kernels are extremely narrow with sensitivity focused entirely inside the low-velocity fault zone layer. Taken together, these phases contain complementary information about fault zone and regional velocity structure. These results indicate that adjoint tomography using high-frequency head and trapped waves kernels, combined with traditional body and surface wave kernels, can constrain fault zone structure across a larger range of scales than has previously been possible.",

            "abstract": "This presentation describes a suite of global precipitation products reconstructed by a multivariate regression method using an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) expansion. The sampling errors of the reconstruction are estimated for each product datum entry. The maximum temporal coverage is 1850-present and the spatial coverage is quasi-global (75S, 75N). The temporal resolution ranges from 5-day, monthly, to seasonal and annual. The Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) precipitation data from 1979-2008 are used to calculate the EOFs. The Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) gridded data are used to calculate the regression coefficients for reconstructions. The sampling errors of the reconstruction are analyzed in detail for different EOF modes. Our reconstructed 1900-2011 time series of the global average annual precipitation shows a 0.024 (mm/day)/100a trend, which is very close to the trend derived from the mean of 25 models of the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5). Our reconstruction examples of 1983 El Niño precipitation and 1917 La Niña precipitation (Figure 1) demonstrate that the El Niño and La Niña precipitation patterns are well reflected in the first two EOFs.\nThe validation of our reconstruction results with GPCP makes it possible to use the reconstruction as the benchmark data for climate models. This will help the climate modeling community to improve model precipitation mechanisms and reduce the systematic difference between observed global precipitation, which hovers at around 2.7 mm/day for reconstructions and GPCP, and model precipitations, which have a range of 2.6-3.3 mm/day for CMIP5.\nOur precipitation products are publically available online, including digital data, precipitation animations, computer codes, readme files, and the user manual.

            "abstract": "The accuracy of solar and wind forecasts is becoming increasingly essential as grid operators continue to integrate additional renewable generation onto the electric grid. Forecast errors affect rate payers, grid operators, wind and solar plant maintenance crews and energy traders through increases in prices, project down time or lost revenue. While extensive and beneficial efforts were undertaken in recent years to improve physical weather models for a broad spectrum of applications these improvements have generally not been sufficient to meet the accuracy demands of system planners. For renewables, these models are often used in conjunction with additional statistical models utilizing both meteorological observations and the power generation data. Forecast accuracy can be dependent on specific weather regimes for a given location. To account for these dependencies it is important that parameterizations used in statistical models change as the regime changes. An automated tool, based on an artificial neural network model, has been developed to identify different weather regimes as they impact power output forecast accuracy at wind or solar farms. In this study, improvements in forecast accuracy were analyzed for varying time horizons for wind farms and utility-scale PV plants located in different geographical regions.",

            "abstract": "Where coastal tsunami hazard is governed by near-field sources, Submarine Mass Failures (SMFs) or earthquakes, tsunami propagation times may be too small for a detection based on deep or shallow water buoys. To offer sufficient warning time, it has been proposed by others to implement early warning systems relying on High Frequency Radar (HFR) remote sensing, that has a dense spatial coverage far offshore.\nA new HFR, referred to as STRADIVARIUS, is being deployed by Diginext Inc. (in Fall 2014), to cover the “Golfe du Lion” (GDL) in the Western Mediterranean Sea. This radar uses a proprietary phase coding technology that allows detection up to 300 km, in a bistatic configuration (for which radar and antennas are separated by about 100 km). Although the primary purpose of the radar is vessel detection in relation to homeland security, the 4.5 MHz HFR will provide a strong backscattered signal for ocean surface waves at the so-called Bragg frequency (here, wavelength of 30 m). The current caused by an arriving tsunami will shift the Bragg frequency, by a value proportional to the current magnitude (projected on the local radar ray direction), which can be easily obtained from the Doppler spectrum of the HFR signal.\nUsing state of the art tsunami generation and propagation models, we modeled tsunami case studies in the western Mediterranean basin (both seismic and SMFs) and simulated the HFR backscattered signal that would be detected for the entire GDL and beyond. Based on simulated HFR signal, we developed two types of tsunami detection algorithms: (i) one based on standard Doppler spectra, for which we found that to be detectable within the environmental and background current noises, the Doppler shift requires tsunami currents to be at least 10-15 cm/s, which typically only occurs on the continental shelf in fairly shallow water; (ii) to allow earlier detection, a second algorithm computes correlations of the HFR signals at two distant locations, shifted in time by the tsunami propagation time between these locations (easily computed based on bathymetry). We found that this second method allowed detection for currents as low as 5 cm/s, i.e., in deeper water, beyond the shelf and further away from the coast, thus allowing an earlier detection.",

            "abstract": "Green Valley Creek provides some of the most critical habitat for endangered coho salmon in the Russian River Watershed. Extensive changes in land-use over the past century have resulted in a dynamic system characterized by ongoing incision in the upper watershed and deposition and increased flood risk in the lower watershed. Effective management requires a watershed-scale understanding of the underlying controls on sediment erosion and transport as well as site-specific studies to understand local habitat conditions and flood dynamics. Here we combine an evaluation of historical changes in watershed conditions with a regional sediment source assessment and detailed numerical hydraulic and sediment transport models to find a sustainable solution to a chronic flooding problem at the Green Valley Road bridge crossing.\nOngoing bank erosion in the upper watershed has been identified as the primary source of coarse sediment being deposited in the rapidly aggrading flood-prone reach upstream of the bridge. Efforts at bank stabilization are part of the overall strategy, however elevated sediment loads can be expected to continue in the near-term. The cessation of historical vegetation removal and maintenance dredging has resulted in a substantial increase in channel roughness as riparian cover has expanded. A positive feedback loop has been developed whereby increased vegetation roughness reduces sediment transport capacity, inducing additional deposition, and providing fresh sediment for continued vegetation recruitment.\nOur analysis revealed that traditional engineering approaches are ineffective. Dredging is not viable owning to the habitat impacts and short timeframes over which the dredged channel would be maintained. Roadway elevation results in a strong backwater effect increasing flood risk upstream. Initial efforts at designing a bypass channel also proved ineffective due to backwater effects below the bridge. The only viable solution involved reducing the downstream backwater effect through removal of an existing partial levee and designing multiple high-flow bypass channels to convey flows past the flood-prone reach. In addition to reducing the flood hazard, the design is relatively resilient to continued deposition and creates new floodplain and side-channel habitat.",

            "abstract": "The IMPROVE network (Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments) monitors regional haze at about 170 sites throughout the U.S. About 20,000 samples of fine particulate matter (Dp < 2.5 um) are collected each year on PTFE filters that are weighed for total mass and analyzed by XRF for elemental concentrations. Light absorption by these samples is measured at 633 nm with the U.C. Davis Hybrid Integrating Plate/Sphere (HIPS) system. Absorption by haze depends in general on the composition, morphology, and microstructure of the individual suspended particles. The ambient particle mix varies widely in the real atmosphere, and is not easily reproduced in controlled laboratory settings. Absorption by a collected sample depends additionally on the filter, sample loading, and heterogeneity of the particle population. Absorption by a filter deposit is thus likely to differ quantitatively from that of the suspended particles in the air column from which it was sampled. This is a recognized limitation of any filter-based absorption measurement, but is widely tolerated in return for the huge increase that filtration provides in sample concentration. Tailoring the absorption measurement to the samples routinely analyzed by XRF does allow us to observe aspects of the absorption-composition relationship in the real world. Newly calibrated measurements from the HIPS system yield a consistent record of light absorption throughout the IMPROVE monitoring network since 2003. Comparisons with IMPROVE chemical data identify both carbon soot and iron-bearing dust as significant contributors to light absorption by particulate matter.",

            "abstract": "The Banda Arc of Indonesia remains one of the least understood tectonic domains on the modern Earth. The island of Sumba, located approximately 50 km south of Flores and 120 km north of the Java Trench, northwest of where it transitions into the Timor Trough, lies in a region of tectonic transition and potentially offers insights into regional dynamics. The Banda Arc is volcanically active, but Sumba itself is not volcanic. The northern coast of Sumba is covered in Quaternary coral terraces, with the rest of the island's surface geology composed of Mio-pliocene carbonates and uplifted Late Cretaceous-Oligocene forearc basin and volcanic rocks. The purpose of this study is to remotely map the topographic expression of the coral terraces and use the information gained to better understand deformation on Sumba since their deposition. The ages of the coral terraces, of which many platforms are exposed over significant areas of the island, have been constrained at Cape Luandi in north central Sumba, but uplift rates calculated from those ages may not be representative of the island as a whole. The lateral continuity of these dated terraces can help constrain the extent to which uplift of Sumba is spatially variable. Analysis of the terraces using SRTM digital elevation data with ArcGIS software makes it possible to trace the same terrace platforms over large distances, and shows that the north central part of the island has experienced the most uplift since the deposition of the terraces, forming an anticline with the east limb dipping more steeply than the west. The terraces are not well preserved on the southern half of the island. Exposure of older rocks and lack of terrace preservation, as well as a south-skewed drainage divide suggests the southern half of the island experiences greater exhumation, but this could be driven by climate or other factors and does not necessarily indicate more rapid uplift. Study of Quaternary deformation of Sumba can offer greater understanding of the ongoing collision of the Banda Arc with the Australian continent. A more complete picture of the region may provide insights into seismic hazards as well as the behavior of arc-continent collision systems and active margins in general.",

            "abstract": "The Calabrian Arc is a subduction-rollback system that has experienced remarkably peaceful forearc tectonics during the last 12 My of rollback, even with 780 km of backarc extension. In contrast, during the Middle Pleistocene rollback slowed and the forearc experienced a surge of tectonic activity including 15-20° of clockwise rotation, arc-parallel extension, and widespread uplift. This rapid and continuous uplift (1-1.2 mm/yr) has affected the entire forearc and is striking because subduction is presumed to be ongoing. No discernable structure or mechanism has been identified to account for all phenomena. We combine structural mapping and erosion rates from 10Be concentrations in river sediment to model river erosion into the Sila Massif, the most prominent highland in northern Calabria. Interfluves between river gorges on the east side of the Sila Massif preserve a tilted paleosurface, which we interpret as subhorizontal until post-Early Pliocene. We reconstruct uplift and river incision using a forward model that is calibrated using the current erosion rates and the elevation of the paleosurface above the Neto River bed. The model tests two end-member structural growth models of uplift: tilting a fixed hinge and tilting from a propagating hinge. The propagating hinge model generates a better fit with the modern river profile and the modern erosion rates. We independently constrain uplift to beginning between 800 ka and 900 ka, consistent with the Late Pleistocene tectonic upheaval. In addition, the results show the Sila Massif grew via tilting with a propagating hinge. This method can be applied to other tectonic regions as a new way to quantify and identify young and active structures.",

            "abstract": "The expected frequency dependence of seismic wave velocities in cracked and fluid-saturated crustal rocks complicates the use of laboratory velocity measurements, traditionally limited to MHz frequencies, for interpretation of seismic data collected at lower frequencies. For appropriately low frequencies of wave propagation, such dispersion results from the relaxation of spatial gradients in pore-fluid pressure by fluid flow. The solution to this dilemma lies in laboratory measurements of elastic velocities, or corresponding moduli, over an appropriately wide range of frequencies. To this end, conventional measurements with ultrasonic (MHz) wave propagation methods are being complemented by sub-resonant forced-oscillation techniques that provide access to lower frequencies. Ultrasonic measurements of P and S wave velocities, and forced-oscillation measurements in both torsional and flexural modes at low frequencies (mHz-Hz), have been conducted on a series of soda-lime silica glass samples with porosities varying from 0 to 6%. Samples were prepared either from dense glass rod or by sintering glass beads under controlled conditions, and subjected to subsequent thermal cracking. All samples are successively tested dry, and with argon and water as pore fluids. The results show systematic increases in wave velocities or elastic moduli with increasing differential pressure (confining pressure minus pore pressure) – interpreted in terms of crack closure. Fluid saturation, especially with water, results in a substantial increase in the moduli measured at MHz frequencies - evidence that the ultrasonic technique is sampling the saturated isobaric regime. A micromechanical model, based on Eshelby’s results and using the differential effective medium scheme, yields crack aspect ratios and crack density as functions of pressure, as well as providing theoretical estimates of the effect of saturation and frequency on elastic moduli. Such dispersion between Hz and MHz frequencies needs to be taken into account in seismological applications of laboratory wave-speed measurements.",

            "abstract": "Fire disturbances can reduce the capacity of tropical forests to cycle water from the soil to the atmosphere, but our understanding of this process remains poor. To address this gap, we studied the effects of fire-related changes in vegetation structure and dynamics on soil water cycling of a transitional forest located between Amazônia and Cerrado, Mato Grosso, Brazil. In particular, we measured monthly soil moisture (from 1 to 9 m depth) using seven soil water pits that were distributed across three 50-ha plots: a plot that represented an unburned control; a plot that was burned in 2004, 2007 and 2010; and, a plot that was burned annually from 2004 to 2010, with exception of 2008. Measurements of soil moisture began after the experimental fires of 2010 (in mid September) and continued until December 2013. We hypothesized that soil moisture would be higher in the burned plots than in the control due to fire-induced reductions in evapotranspiration. Our preliminary results provide only partial support for this hypothesis. We observed a high variability in soil moisture between treatments, among months, and across years. For example, the unburned control tended to hold more soil water throughout the soil profile in wet-season months. However, soil moisture tended to be higher in the experimentally burned plots during the driest months of the year (August and September), but this pattern was no consistant across drought and non-drought years. These results show that fires exert complex influences on the soil water cycling of this transitional forest, perhaps even promoting increased evapotranspiration in the burned plots due to reduced competition among trees for resources.",

This is typically necessary because of limited availability and resolution of watershed data, including precipitation, surface flows, soil distributions, land cover and drainage network hydraulic characteristics. The extent to which parameters are lumped is most often a decision made by the investigator with attention to research objectives, data availability, and model capabilities. Here we summarize the implications of parameter lumping to model efficiency using a distributed hydrologic simulation platform (MIKE SHE) applied to the Northwest River watershed in southern Maine, U.S.A. We compare parameter lumping effects on surface flows at the watershed outlet by varying the spatial scale (grid size), precipitation time step, computational time step, and agglomeration of landscape characteristics. The outcomes of these analyses are summarized relative to model efficiency with discussion of the implications to watershed management decisions and strategies.",

            "abstract": "We conducted a rigorous analysis of the drivers of seasonality in the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Many studies report annual cycles in UHI intensity and have attributed those patterns to various hypotheses, including seasonal trends in wind and clouds, prevalence of anti-cyclonic conditions, soil moisture, and day length. But to our knowledge, those hypotheses have never been tested, leaving a substantial gap in our basic understanding of the urban climate.\nWe tested these and other hypotheses using two years of continuous temperature measurements from an array of 150 sensors in and around Madison, Wisconsin USA, an urban area of 407,000 surrounded by lakes and a rural landscape of agriculture, forests, wetlands, and grasslands. This is one of the best replicated urban climate arrays ever deployed, which allowed us to characterize the UHI in rich spatial and temporal detail and rigorously assess the biophysical and synoptic drivers of its seasonal variation.\nUHI intensities were typically highest in summer and lowest in winter. Seasonal trends in wind speed and cloud cover generally tracked annual trends in UHI intensity, with the clearer, calmer conditions conducive to stronger UHIs more common in summer. This is consistent with the hypothesis that seasonal trends in wind, clouds, and anti-cyclonic conditions drive UHI seasonality. However, clear, calm summer nights still had higher UHI intensities than clear, calm winter nights, indicating that some background factor shifted baseline UHI intensities throughout the year. We found that regional vegetation and snow cover conditions set distinct seasonal baselines for UHI intensity, with nighttime intensities averaging 4°C in summer and 1°C in winter. Synoptic and biophysical factors that vary on shorter time scales (e.g. wind, clouds, soil moisture, relative humidity) modified daily UHI intensity around those baselines by 1-3°C but were not the primary drivers of UHI seasonality, contrary to the most common hypotheses in the literature.\nIn addition to clarifying the drivers of UHI seasonality, our results have implications for the design and interpretation of UHI studies, particularly in how the timing of data collection might affect results and conclusions.",

            "abstract": "Better quantification of the spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture across different spatial scales can greatly help us understanding the Earth as an integrated system. To obtain high resolution root zone soil moisture (RZSM), we applied the TOPMODEL-based Land Surface-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (TOPLATS) over the Oklahoma region driven by coarse scale (0.125 degree) meteorological forcing from NLDAS. The simulated RZSM is then evaluated against in-situ observations from 16 stations in the study domain, and the model performance is assessed using the average relative error (RE) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The simulated spatial distribution of soil moisture is largely consistent with the distribution of topographic index (TI) in most part of Oklahoma as topography has traditionally been considered the dominant factor in horizontal redistribution of soil moisture. Evaluation over individual stations show that RE is generally smaller than 10% and RMSE is mostly smaller than 0.05 m3/m3. At daily, monthly and seasonal time scales, the simulation was able to capture the observed variation of RZSM at most stations. In addition to topographic index and precipitation distribution, our analysis also suggested that surface temperature plays an important role in determining soil moisture distribution through regulating the evapotranspiration. The overall evaluation confirms that the TOPLATS model can be a useful downscaling tool for obtaining high resolution soil moisture.",

            "abstract": "Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is one of many biologically derived gases and particles emitted from the ocean that has the potential to affect climate. In the case of DMS it is oxidized to sulfate, which increases the aerosol loading in the atmosphere either through nucleation or condensation on other aerosols, which in turn changes the energy balance of the Earth by reflection of sunlight either through direct reflection by the aerosols or by modifying clouds. We have previously shown that the geographical distribution of DMS emission from the ocean may be quite sensitive to climate changes, especially in the Southern Ocean.\nWe have updated our state-of-the-art sulfur-cycle Earth system model (ESM), based on the Community Earth System Model (CESM) climate model, to include the indirect effect of DMS derived sulfate on clouds by using the Modal Aerosol Model (MAM), and have updated our ocean sulfur ecosystem model in light of updated ocean DMS observations.\nWe are now simulating the impact of DMS on the energy balance and climate of the Earth system, and its sensitivity/feedback to climate change. The estimate from our initial simulations is that DMS in the pre-industrial era is responsible for ~3.5 W/m2 of reflected sunlight, globally averaged (other preindustrial aerosols were included). Our next set of simulations will estimate the sensitivity/feedback to climate change, including the effects of anthropogenic aerosols.\nSupport for this work was provided through the Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) program funded by U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Advanced Scientific Computing Research and Biological and Environmental Research.

            "abstract": "Flood events and debris flows are characterized by a very rapid response of basins to precipitation, often resulting in loss of life and property damage. Complex topography with steep slopes and narrow valleys increase the likelihood of having these events. An early warning system (EWS) is a tool that allows anticipating a hazardous event, which in turns provides time for an early response to reduce negative impacts. These EWS’s can rely on very powerful and computer-demanding models to predict flow discharges and inundation zones, which require data typically unavailable. Instead, simpler EWS´s based on a statistical analysis of observed hydro-meteorological data could be a good alternative. In this work we propose a methodology for estimating the probability of exceedance of maximum flowdischarges using principal components analysis (PCA). In the method we first perform a spatio-temporal cross-correlation analysis between extreme flows data and daily meteorological records for the last 15 days prior to the day of the flood event. We then use PCA to create synthetic variables which are representative of the meteorological variables associated with the flood event (i.e. cumulative rainfall and minimum temperature). Finally, we developed a model to explain the probability of exceedance using the principal components. The methodology was applied to a basin in the foothill area of Santiago, Chile, for which all the extreme events between 1970 and 2013 were analyzed.Results show that elevation rather than distance or location within the contributing basin is what mainly explains the statistical correlation between meteorologicalrecords and flood events. Two principal components were found that explain more than 90% of the total variance of the accumulated rainfalls and minimum temperatures. One component was formed with cumulative rainfall from 3 to 15 days prior to the event, whereas the other one was formed with the minimum temperatures for the last 2 days preceding the event. Finally, a simple model relating the probability of exceedance of flood with the two principal components was successfully implemented (i.e. with values of R2>0.7).",

            "abstract": "Middle–late Campanian strata of the Book Cliffs record the deposition of three clastic wedges in the foreland basin east of the Sevier fold-thrust belt. Variations in wedge geometries provide an opportunity to evaluate the effects of sediment supply versus accommodation on foreland basin architecture. There is an increase in eastward progradation rate between the L. and M. Castlegate Sandstone, followed by a return to slower progradation rates in the overlying Bluecastle Tongue, and Price River Formation, as well as their lateral equivalents. Rapid progradation may be caused by increased sediment supply, due either to rapid exhumation in the Sevier fold-thrust belt, or changes in the sediment source. Alternatively, reduced accommodation within the foreland basin due to uplift during initial Laramide deformation could produce the same rapid progradation. In this scenario, decreased progradation would be coincident with enhanced foreland basin subsidence and rapid sediment accumulation in the proximal foredeep. We test these hypotheses using thermo- and geochronology to double date individual detrital grains, enabling identification of changes in lag time and sediment provenance. Upsection decreases or increases in lag time correspond to increased or decreased exhumation rates, respectively, or introduction of a new upper crustal sedimentary source. We focus on 21 samples from 7 measured sections along depositional strike and dip. Samples were collected from the upper Blackhawk Formation, L. and M. Castlegate Sandstone, Bluecastle Tongue, Price River Formation, and their lateral equivalents. Initial results indicate major sediment provenance changes associated with the transition between slow and rapid wedge progradation, as well as minor provenance changes within individual wedges. There is also a significantly greater proportion of Cordilleran magmatic arc grains in distal locations than in proximal locations, interpreted as sediment mixing during transport.",

            "abstract": "As part of ongoing calibration and validation efforts for the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), we have developed a framework for running forward model calculations based on interpolated reanalysis data products from numerical weather prediction centers. These forward calculations can then be compared to the observations to check for bias errors or artifacts. The framework has a flexible design which allows for multiple forward models to be run. It will support a variety of studies, for example comparisons with high accuracy reference forward models on selected subsets, or comparisons with faster approximate models on more extensive data sets. These studies can help characterize sensor biases as well as differences between radiative transfer models. Initial results using the reference line-by-line model LBLRTM, from Atmospheric and Environmental Research, reveal small biases in the CrIS measurements that are dependent on both the detector and interferometer sweep direction. Updated calibration algorithms applied to the raw CrIS data are then tested within the framework to determine the best way to reduce the bias errors. This work is expected to lead to improvements in the radiative transfer modeling of the CrIS instrument line shape needed for accurate assimilation of the CrIS full resolution radiance spectra.",

            "abstract": "The transition region of the solar atmosphere is no longer believed to be exclusively a thin boundary layer connecting the chromosphere and the corona. Instead, the emission from this region is dominated by dynamic, low-lying loops with peak temperatures <1 MK. These loops also appear in AIA data due to the transition region spectral lines in the AIA passbands, but have not been studied with great detail. The IRIS instrument has resolved these loops both spatially and temporally. With an IRIS image cadence of approximately 10 seconds, we are able to study the evolution of these loops.\nWe have developed a technique to automatically identify events (i.e., brightenings) on a pixel-by-pixel basis applying a set of selection criteria. The pixels are then grouped according to their proximity in space and relative progression of the event. This method allows us to characterize their overall lifetime and the rate at which these events occur. Our current progress includes identification of these groups of events in IRIS data, determination of their existence in AIA data, and characterization based on a comparison between the two. If the same events appear in both IRIS and AIA data, it may suggest that the intrinsic transition region is not in local thermodynamic equilibrium. We present the results that follow each integral step in the analysis and provide a preliminary characterization of a few example events within our data set.",

The National Climate Assessment refers to \"no-regrets\" strategies (i.e., beneficial despite uncertainty), such as, e.g., energy efficiency, cultivating networks, and growing our adaptive capacity. As we cultivate our capacity as a species to pivot, climate leadership performance and its improvement become legitimate - and essential - realms of research, planning, and practice. However, climate leadership across sectors is not yet well-articulated; and operationalizing literacy expressed as 'what to do' may be viewed as overtly prescriptive by scientists.

            "abstract": "The East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) varies on inter-decadal to interglacial-glacial timescales. The EASM is stronger in the mid-Holocene than today, and these changes can be readily explained by orbitally-driven insolation increase during the boreal summer. However, a detailed understanding of the altered seasonal evolution of the EASM during this time is still lacking. In particular, previous work has suggested a close link between seasonal migration of the EASM and that of the mid-latitude westerlies impinging on the Tibetan Plateau.\nIn this study, we explore, this problem in PMIP3 climate model simulations of the mid-Holocene, focusing on the role of atmospheric circulation and in particular how the westerly jet modulates the East Asia summer climate on paleoclimate timescales. Analysis of the model simulations suggests that, compared to the preindustrial simulations, the transition from Mei-Yu to deep summer rainfall occurs earlier in the mid-Holocene. This is accompanied by an earlier weakening and northward shift of westerly jet away from the Tibetan Plateau. The variation in the strength and the 3-D structure of the westerly jet in the mid-Holocene is summarized. We find that changes to the monsoonal rainfall, westerly jet and meridional circulation covary on paleoclimate timescales. Meridional wind changes in particular are tied to an altered stationary wave pattern, resembling today’s the so-called ‘Silk Road’ teleconnection pattern, riding along the westerly jet. Diagnostic analysis also reveals changes in moist static energy and eddy energy fluxes associated with the earlier seasonal transition of the EASM. Our analyses suggest that the westerly jet is critical to the altered dynamics of the East Asian summer monsoon during the mid-Holocene.",

Several recent analyses have concluded that aridity will, in general, increase over land primarily because of increasing vapour pressure deficit. Taken at face value that result is difficult to understand because a warmer world is also anticipated to be a moister world. For example, at the global scale, climate model projections are for increasing rainfall and runoff. In this presentation we investigate this seeming paradox. We find that the previous analyses have not accounted for the biological impacts of elevated CO2 and when that is incorporated, the climate model projections are for a modest reduction in meteorological and hydrologic aridity and for larger reductions in biological aridity.",

In particular the on-demand aspect of this work involves the improvement (via faster processing and a reduction in overall running times) for determination of fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) from Landsat TM/ETM+.\nOur observations indicate that processing tasks associated with remote sensing including the Snow Covered Area and Grain Size Model (SCAG) when applied to MODIS or LANDSAT TM/ETM+ are computationally intensive processes. We believe the shift to the CUDA programming paradigm represents a significant improvement in the ability to more quickly assert the outcomes of such activities. We use the TMSCAG model as our subject to highlight this argument. We do this by describing how we can ingest a LANDSAT surface reflectance image (typically provided in HDF format), perform spectral mixture analysis to produce land cover fractions including snow, vegetation and rock/soil whilst greatly reducing running time for such tasks.\nWithin the scope of this work we first document the original workflow used to assert fSCA for Landsat TM and it’s primary shortcomings. We then introduce the logic and justification behind the switch to the CUDA paradigm for running single as well as batch jobs on the GPU in order to achieve parallel processing. Finally we share lessons learned from the implementation of myriad of existing algorithms to a single set of code in a single target language as well as benefits this ultimately provides scientists at the USGS.",

Instead of probing the mechanical properties of a material by testing the relationship between “bulk” stress and strain rate in a sample at a variety of conditions (varying P, T, water content, and other environmental variables), synchrotron x-ray diffraction now allows us to observe, in situ, the active deformation physics in much greater detail. This includes in situ monitoring of plastic anisotropy and local stress heterogeneity, grain size, the development of lattice-preferred orientation (LPO), and even the partitioning of stress between multiple phases in the same polycrystalline sample. Here, we present results obtained with the use of the MTEX toolbox for Matlab and energy-dispersive x-ray diffraction, showing the in situ development of LPO in deforming dry San Carlos olivine samples, at pressures from 2-7 GPa. These measurements hint at the active dislocation mechanisms for these conditions. The ability generate a broad range of mantle conditions in the D-DIA, while precisely measuring the structure and conditions within our sample at the grain and lattice scale, demonstrates the promising future of deformation experiments as a means to understanding the evolution of the deep Earth.",

            "abstract": "This work is concerned with the relationship between hydraulic fracturing injection and induced seismicity on a fault. This is applicable to safety hazard assessment of the nucleation of dynamic slip along the fault as a result of hydraulic fracturing injection into or near the fault. The hydraulic fracture (HF) injection into the fault can be purposeful, for instance to trigger an earthquake in more controllable conditions than would happen otherwise; or in order to use the open portion of the fault as a reservoir heat exchanger for the extraction of geothermal heat. It can be unintentional due to lack of accurate subsurface characterization prior to the injection.\nInjection with constant flow rate into an impermeable fault will initiate slip along the fault. The slip occurs due to the lack of frictional strength along the open part of the fault (the hydraulic fracture) as well as from the reduction of the normal stress ahead of the hydraulic fracture front. Slip in front of the hydraulic fracture is assumed to degrade the tensile strength of the fault to zero, so that the hydraulic fracture propagation takes place in the viscous-dominated regime (i.e. dominated by viscous losses in the fluid flow inside the fracture). In our model, the nucleation of dynamic slip is related to the slip-weakening nature of the friction, and depends on in-situ stresses, pressure distribution inside the hydraulic fracture, and the evolving length of the hydraulic fracture. The results of this study show that the growth of the fault slipping patch remains stable, with no episode of dynamic rupture, when the background shear stress τb is smaller than the residual shear strength τr of the fault under ambient conditions. Otherwise (τb > τr), nucleation takes place when the extent of the hydraulic fracture reaches the critical length ~ (μ/τp) δc, where μ is the elastic shear modulus of the rock, τp is the peak shear strength of the fault, and δc is the characteristic slip weakening distance. The size of the slipping patch ahead of the HF tip obeys roughly similar scaling. This scaling changes when τb is just slightly larger than τr in which case both critical hydraulic fracture and slipping patch lengths increase strongly with diminishing τb, and become unbounded when stress stability boundary (τb= τr) is approached.",

            "abstract": "We detail how Apache Open Climate Workbench (OCW) (recently open sourced by NASA JPL) was adapted to facilitate an ongoing study of Mesoscale Convective Complexes (MCCs) in West Africa and their contributions within the weather-climate continuum as it relates to climate variability. More than 400 MCCs occur annually over various locations on the globe. In West Africa, approximately one-fifth of that total occur during the summer months (June-November) alone and are estimated to contribute more than 50% of the seasonal rainfall amounts. Furthermore, in general the non-discriminatory socio-economic geospatial distribution of these features correlates with currently and projected densely populated locations. As such, the convective nature of MCCs raises questions regarding their seasonal variability and frequency in current and future climates, amongst others. However, in spite of the formal observation criteria of these features in 1980, these questions have remained comprehensively unanswered because of the untimely and subjective methods for identifying and characterizing MCCs due to limitations data-handling limitations. The main outcome of this work therefore documents how a graph-based search algorithm was implemented on top of the OCW stack with the ultimate goal of improving fully automated end-to-end identification and characterization of MCCs in high resolution observational datasets.\nApache OCW as an open source project was demonstrated from inception and we display how it was again utilized to advance understanding and knowledge within the above domain. The project was born out of refactored code donated by NASA JPL from the Earth science community’s Regional Climate Model Evaluation System (RCMES), a joint project between the Joint Institute for Regional Earth System Science and Engineering (JIFRESSE), and a scientific collaboration between the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and NASA JPL. The Apache OCW project was then integrated back into the donor code with the aim of more efficiently powering that project. Notwithstanding, the object-oriented approach to creating a core set of libraries Apache OCW has scaled the usability of the project beyond climate model evaluation as displayed in the MCC use case detailed herewith.",

            "abstract": "Since the distribution of sea ice and land ice in the Antarctic is closely related to the global climate system, there has been great effort in monitoring various types of ice in the area. In particular, the spatiotemporal distribution of various ice types (e.g., pack ice, fast ice, glacier, and iceberg) around the Wilkinson glacier in the West Antarctic has been rapidly changing due to on-going climate change. Remote sensing, especially high resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), can be utilized to effectively monitor the spatial and temporal distribution of ice. The existing literature suggests that various polarimetric techniques can be used to classify ice types based on the magnitudes of cross-polarization ratios, correlation coefficients between HH and VV polarized signals, and entropy/alpha parameters. The distinctive difference of salinity in sea ice and land ice results in the different scattering patterns in the electromagnetic wave. However, land ice, land-fast ice and some types of icebergs are not distinguishable by the existing techniques. The purpose of this study was to investigate full-polarimetric RADARSAT-2 SAR data for detecting various types of ice focusing on land ice, land-fast ice, and icebergs using machine learning approaches—See5.0, random forest, and support vector machines. Very high resolution airborne SAR data were used for validation of the proposed approach.",

            "abstract": "Lu-Hf garnet dating of Proterozoic rocks of the southwestern United States provides constraints on the timing and geographic extent of metamorphism associated with the Yavapai, Mazatzal, and newly recognized Picuris orogenies. Prior work focusing on U-Pb dating of plutons and Ar geochronology has left the timing of prograde metamorphism ambiguous, particularly in northern New Mexico and southern Colorado. Because the Lu-Hf system dates the onset of garnet growth, it can constrain the timing of the prograde P-T path.\nGarnet schist samples from central and northern New Mexico exhibit garnet growth restricted to the time period between ~1460 and 1400 Ma. In the Picuris and Manzano mountains, the oldest Lu-Hf garnet ages predate the U-Pb ages of ~1.4 Ga plutons located near the dated samples. This implies that garnet growth, and therefore the onset of amphibolite facies metamorphism, cannot be driven by contact metamorphism, as has been previously inferred.\nGarnet-bearing samples from the Needle and Wet Mountains in southern Colorado display a range of garnet ages between ~1750 and 1470 Ma. A garnet gneiss from the Needle Mountains in southwestern Colorado yields an age of 1748 Ma, which is consistent with the Yavapai orogeny. This Lu-Hf garnet age has not been reset by contact metamorphism associated with the emplacement of the ~1.4 Ga Eolus batholith. Anatectic garnet in an orthogneiss from the northern Wet Mountains yields an age of 1601 Ma and is interpreted to date partial melting at the close of the Mazatzal orogeny. A 1476 Ma garnet age from the aureole of the 1440 Ma Oak Creek pluton is interpreted to date upper amphibolite facies metamorphism.\nThe age distribution of these samples shows that rocks in Colorado underwent a complex, poly-metamorphic history, while rocks in New Mexico underwent a single progressive metamorphic event. This contrast implies that the boundary between rocks deformed and metamorphosed during the ~1800-1600 Ma Yavapai and Mazatzal orogenies and those only deformed and metamorphosed during the ~1460-1400 Ma Picuris orogeny lies in northern New Mexico, along what has previously been considered the Mazatzal front. By using Lu-Hf geochronology to directly date a rock-forming mineral, we are better able to reconstruct the tectonic history of this region.",

            "abstract": "Eddy-covariance based observations of carbon fluxes across the globe have been shown to underestimate CO2 fluxes under stable atmospheric conditions. Net ecosystem exchange overestimations have been attributed to the selective systematic error caused by this problem, because stable conditions are frequently nocturnal, at a time that coincides with autotrophic respiration. The most general approach to correct observations during stable conditions is based on relationships between carbon or other fluxes and surface friction velocity (). This velocity scale variable represents the square root of the total vertical flux of horizontal momentum near the surface, which in turn is a function of the canopy density and roughness. Thus, under stable conditions, when near ground fluxes are decoupled from above canopy fluxes, we argue that might not be the most optimal criteria to correct nighttime fluxes. Alternative criteria to overcome the aforementioned issues were tested. We analyzed the use of the standard deviation of the vertical velocity fluctuations, σw, and a velocity scale relationship with the turbulent kinetic energy, , as surface atmospheric state variables to filter eddy covariance data under stable conditions. We found results that are similar to those reported by Acevedo et al. (2009) and Wharton et al. (2009), which confirm that in several cases the use of alternative surface atmospheric state variables for nighttime flux correction might be a more robust method in comparison to the traditional approach, and is theoretically more defensible.",

SMAP includes the first 3 KM resolution product, by both radar and radiometer sensors which will transmit useful information concentrating on the global measurements of soil moisture and freeze/thaw cycles. NOAA- CREST (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration- Cooperative Remote Sensing Science and Technology) deploys a series of in-situ devices into the soil, and an L-BAND Radiometer close to the site ground at the Cary Institute in Millbrook, NY. The site is important for future validation of SMAP mission. Comparing mathematical and ground based remote sensing of soil moisture is beneficial to ensure the accuracy of the measurements.\nThe focus of this research is to analyze and compare soil moisture from ESA- SMOS (Europe Space Agency- Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity) mission and the Cary Institute’s soil moisture measurements within the same time period, and location. In the interest of establishing superb authentication; comparing SMOS and ground measurements will justify the accuracy of the newly launch satellite. Discrepancies can be found between field point measurement and relatively large footprint of SMOS, which affects comparison and validation. Several techniques and statistical methods will provide a more meaningful comparison to analyze soil moisture data. The results of this project will help to provide a useful method to compare the NOAA-CREST soil moisture measurements and SMAP measurements. In conclusion, the SMAP advance technology will provide more accurate feedback for modeling numerical weather and climate models.\nKeywords: Soil Moisture, Precipitation, CREST-SMART, Cary Institute, In-situ, Remote Sensors\nAccurate Soil Moisture Data, Millbrook, N.Y., CATDS, Hydrology is the branch of science concerning properties of earth’s water especially its movement in relation to land.

            "abstract": "Injection of supercritical CO2 for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) presents an opportunity to evaluate the effects of CO2 on reservoir properties and formation waters during geologic carbon sequestration. Produced water from oil wells tapping a carbonate-hosted reservoir at an active EOR site in the Permian Basin of Texas both before and after injection were sampled to evaluate geochemical and isotopic changes associated with water-rock-CO2 interaction. Produced waters from the carbonate reservoir rock are Na-Cl brines with TDS levels of 16.5-34 g/L and detectable H2S. These brines are potentially diluted with shallow groundwater from earlier EOR water flooding. Initial lithium isotope data (δ7Li) from pre-injection produced water in the EOR field fall within the range of Gulf of Mexico Coastal sedimentary basin and Appalachian basin values (Macpherson et al., 2014, Geofluids, doi: 10.1111/gfl.12084). Pre-injection produced water 87Sr/86Sr ratios (0.70788-0.70795) are consistent with mid-late Permian seawater/carbonate. CO2 injection took place in October 2013, and four of the wells sampled in May 2014 showed CO2 breakthrough. Preliminary comparison of pre- and post-injection produced waters indicates no significant changes in the major inorganic constituents following breakthrough, other than a possible drop in K concentration. Trace element and isotope data from pre- and post-breakthrough wells are currently being evaluated and will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Northern winter is the season when planetary-scale waves and blockings are most energetic. Here, by utilizing global reanalysis and satellite datasets, we show that northward moisture flux into the Arctic during the winter, followed by an enhancement in downward IR, can warm the surface by 20-40 Wm-2, hence cause reduction of sea-ice volume. It is proposed that the recurrence of strong downward IR events within a single winter season is able to reduce the sea-ice volume over wide area of Arctic Ocean. While downward IR is less effective than surface winds in changing sea-ice cover on intraseasonal time scales, the cumulative effect throughout the season can be larger. Further analysis indicates that the downward IR events are preceded several days by enhanced convection over the tropical Indian-western Pacific Ocean. This finding verifies that tropical SST pattern and the associated Rossby wave propagation can have a critical impact on the Arctic sea-ice conditions.",

            "abstract": "Recent observations of the asteroid Ceres made in the far infrared indicate that the body is outgassing water vapor at a rate of approximately 6 kg/s [1]. We find that a model for the flux of vapor from a partially ice-saturated regolith on Ceres, driven outward by the geothermal gradient for an assumed heat flux of ~1 mW/m2 , can produce a comparable global flux of H2O vapor. The same model applied to the flux of CO2 vapor from the regolith of Callisto [2] (assuming a water ice regolith partially saturated with CO2 ice) produces a global flux approximately equal to the estimated source flux required to maintain the observed CO2exosphere against known loss processes (0.3 kg/s) [3].\nOur model is based on previous theoretical work related to deep equatorial ground ice on Mars [4] that demonstrated how an assumed initially pore-filling subsurface ice layer would retreat when near-surface conditions made the ground ice no longer stable. Mellon [4], and Clifford [5], pointed out that once the ice table (the shallowest depth with a non-zero volume fraction of pore ice) retreated below a certain depth, the linear gradient of vapor density established by diffusion of vapor to the surface would necessarily go through the supersaturated regime of its phase diagram and therefore recondense as pore ice, an effect not considered in previous work [6]. Once this occurs, a steady-state profile of ice volume fraction, f_ice(z), develops, with net mass loss only occurring from the retreating pore-filling ice layer. The rate of vapor flux to the surface is then determined only by the vapor density and temperature gradient at the ice table depth (z0). We use an analytic physical model for regolith thermal conductivity [7,8] and a range of assumed values for the crustal heat flux to calculate the temperature gradient at z0, then integrate over all latitudes where surface ice is unstable to find the resulting global vapor flux.\n",

The synthetic Green’s functions (SGFs) are calculated with an initial regional 3D shear wave model determined from ballistic Rayleigh wave tomography from earthquake records with periods longer than 20 s. The frequency-dependent traveltime time misfits between the SGFs and EGFs are minimized iteratively using adjoint tomography = to refine 3D crustal structure [Chen et al. 2014]. The final 3D model shows lateral shear wave velocity variations that are well correlated with the geological terranes within the continental interior. In particular, the final model reveals low velocities distributed along the axis of the Espino Graben, indicating that the graben has a substantially different crustal structure than the rest of the Eastern Venezuela Basin.

As the spatiotemporal distribution of land-fast sea ice is closely related to the global and polar climate systems, it is crucial to accurately monitor land-fast sea ice to better understand the climate systems. Remote sensing can be used to monitor land-fast sea ice as it provides data covering vast areas at high temporal resolution. While remote sensing-based land-fast sea ice monitoring has been investigated in the Arctic areas, very few studies were conducted over the Antarctic areas. In particular, no studies have been conducted in the western Antarctic due to much greater variability of sea ice and more complex topography than the eastern Antarctic.\nThe purpose of this study was to develop an automated land-fast sea ice monitoring approach using multi-sensor data fusion and machine learning approaches in the entire Antarctic especially focusing on the western part. The basic assumptions of land-fast sea ice with almost 100% of sea ice concentration and almost 0 m/s of sea ice velocity were used. Based on these assumptions, a total of 11 variables including sea ice concentration, 8 dual polarization frequency channels from The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E), ice surface temperature from visible/TIR sensor such as the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and ice velocity from Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) were used to identify land-fast sea ice. In addition to the 11 remote sensing-based variables, previous land-fast sea ice results visually identified using MODIS data by Fraser in the eastern Antarctic were used as reference data. Two rule-based machine learning approaches including See5.0 and random forest were used to map land-fast sea ice. Long-term temporal changes of the Antarctic land-fast sea ice distribution were analyzed during the period of 2000 to 2008 at multiple time scales. National Snow & Ice Data Center (NSIDC)-provided 250m MODIS Antarctic ice shelf images and high resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data (Radarsat 2) were used to validate the spatial distribution of the predicted land-fast sea ice.",

            "abstract": "Parameterizations in models attempt to statistically relate large-scale atmospheric variables such as temperature, humidity, and winds with variables that change on scales too small to resolve, such as cloud properties. We use atmospheric classification to establish the relationships between large- and small-scale variables in observations and compare these relationships to those that exist in GFDL’s AM3 model.\nAtmospheric states for a region surrounding the ARM Southern Great Plains (SGP) site are created with a clustering technique. Atmospheric state in this context can be thought of as a frequently occurring regional weather pattern. States are defined by ERA-Interim reanalysis data and validated with observations from the SGP cloud radar. We classify the state of the atmosphere every 6 hours, creating a time series of atmospheric state. This time series is used to composite ISCCP data to create joint cloud top pressure – optical depth histograms of cloud occurrence for each state.\nSnapshots from the AM3 model are sorted into the observed atmospheric states, and cloud occurrence data from the ISCCP simulator are composited to produce modeled joint histograms of cloud occurrence. Comparison of the observed and modeled cloud occurrence for a single state provides a test of the model parameterization under a particular set of physical conditions. In contrast, comparing the observed frequency of occurrence of the atmospheric states with their occurrence within AM3 tests how well the model reproduces the conditions of the region. Doing so allows us to parse the model’s total bias of cloud occurrence into contributions from the parameterization, and contributions from the distribution of states.\nWe find that the model lacks high thin cloud under all conditions in the model, but that biases in deep thick cloud are state-dependent. We show that frontal conditions in the model do not produce enough deep thick cloud, while weather patterns associated with isolated convection produce too much. We find that increasing the horizontal resolution of the model improves both of these biases, but also changes the distribution of states, ultimately increasing the total cloud occurrence bias. This creates an interesting question of whether or not the high resolution run performs better than the low resolution.",

            "abstract": "Recent ecological research has strongly linked plant function to leaf-level biochemical and plant structural traits over a wide range of species and environmental conditions. Broad classifications of plant functional types (PFTs) have conventionally been used in mapping and modeling efforts, as they capture major patterns in the variation of these traits. While strong relationships between canopy imaging spectrometer data and leaf biochemical composition have been established in tropical ecosystems, these relationships have not been well-documented over a broader range of ecosystems. In this study, we sought to characterize relationships between leaf-level functional traits and leaf and canopy-scale reflectance. We examined how variation within each data set corresponds to conventional PFTs and how additional sources of variation at canopy level can impact these relationships. We collected leaf trait data (pigments, water, dry matter, thickness, carbon & nitrogen) and leaf reflectance from a diverse set of species and PFTs across multiple sites and seasons in California as part of the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) mission study. Image data were acquired by the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). Using ordination analysis, we assessed major axes of variation in leaf traits, leaf spectra and canopy spectra by species and functional types. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering analysis was used to evaluate existing groups within each dataset and to determine how well these match conventional PFTs. We also investigated the role of pixel composition and structure on spectral clustering within the AVIRIS data. Our results show that both leaf spectral clusters and biochemical trait clusters correspond to differences among species and sites, as well as conventional PFTs. Greater variation is present in the leaf spectra than in the biochemical data, indicating the spectra may be sensitive to additional leaf traits. Canopy-level spectral clusters were different from leaf-level clusters, though species and site differences were still observed. We demonstrate these differences can be attributed to pixel composition and canopy structure that must be accounted for if sensors such as HyspIRI will be used to accurately retrieve canopy biochemistry and leaf functional traits.",

            "abstract": "The Macquarie Marshes is a system of permanent and semi-permanent marshes, swamps and lagoons interconnected by braided channels. The Marshes are located in the semi-arid region in north western NSW, Australia, and constitute part of the northern Murray–Darling Basin. The wetland complex serves as nesting place and habitat for many species of water birds, fish, frogs and crustaceans, and portions of the Marshes was listed as internationally important under the Ramsar Convention. Over the last four decades, some of the wetlands have undergone degradation, which has been attributed to flow abstraction and regulation at Burrendong Dam upstream of the marshes. Among the many characteristics that make this wetland system unique is the occurrence of channel breakdown and channel avulsion, which are associated with decline of river flow in the downstream direction typical of dryland streams. Decrease in river flow can lead to sediment deposition, decrease in channel capacity, vegetative invasion of the channel, overbank flows, and ultimately result in channel breakdown and changes in marsh formation. A similar process on established marshes may also lead to channel avulsion and marsh abandonment. All the previous geomorphological evolution processes have an effect on the established ecosystem, which will produce feedbacks on the hydrodynamics of the system and affect the geomorphology in return.\nIn order to simulate the complex dynamics of the marshes we have developed an ecogeomorphological framework that combines hydrodynamic, vegetation and channel evolution modules. The hydrodynamic simulation provides spatially distributed values of inundation extent, duration, depth and recurrence to drive a vegetation model based on species preference to hydraulic conditions. It also provides velocities and shear stresses to assess geomorphological changes. Regular updates of stream network, floodplain surface elevations and vegetation coverage provide feedbacks to the hydrodynamic model. We perform preliminary tests by running continuous simulation over several years and compare the results to existing hydrological, vegetation and geomorphological data to assess the model capabilities and limitations. We also analyse the effects of the implementation of a number of water management strategies.",

Motivation stems from advances in microelectronics and consumer electronic technology. Given the technological inovations over the past 20 years it now possible to develop new instrumentation to study the auroral ionosphere and stratospheric ozone layer using ultralight balloon payloads for less than 6lbs and $3K per payload. The UH USIP undergraduate team is currently in the process of build ten such payloads for launch using1500 gm latex weather balloons to be deployed in Houston and Fairbanks, AK as well as zero pressure balloons launched from northern Sweden. The latex balloon project will collect vertical profiles of wind speed, wind direction, temperature, electrical conductivity, ozone and odd nitrogen. This instrument payload will also profiles of pressure, electric field, and air-earth electric current. The zero pressure balloons will obtain a suite of geophysical measurements including: DC electric field, electric field and magnetic flux, optical imaging, total electron content of ionosphere via dual-channel GPS, X-ray detection, and infrared/UV spectroscopy. Students will fly payloads with different combinations of these instruments to determine which packages are successful. Data collected by these instruments will be useful in understanding the nature of electrodynamic coupling in the upper atmosphere and how the global earth system is changing. Results and best practices learned from lab tests and initial Houston test flights will be discussed.",

The firn-physics group at the University of Washington is developing modular and open-source community models describing evolution of firn density, temperature, diffusivity, and other structural properties affecting gas transport. A novel aspect is that the gas model can be coupled to the density model, allowing bubble-close-off depth, lock-in depth, depth-integrated porosity, and effective diffusivity to evolve in the gas-transport model. This feature allows us to investigate changes in firn physical properties and the evolving impacts of those changes on gas diffusion, thermal and gravitational fractionation, and the mixing ratio of gasses in bubbles trapped in firn during climate change events. Here, we use ice-core derived and synthetic climate data to show the scope of these impacts for gradual and abrupt climate changes.",

Leaves may mitigate heat stress through physiological or physical strategies which include minimizing heat load, maximizing evaporative cooling or biochemical stabilization.\nIn this study, leaf temperature of wild-type and genetically modified (GM) poplar trees was monitored using a thermal infrared camera and fine wire thermocouples. The GM trees did not have the capacity to produce the compound isoprene, hypothesized to biochemically protect plants against heat stress. One genotype had GM process applied, but retained isoprene making capacity (empty-vector). Temperature of ambient air and of an artificial leaf of similar size/color were also monitored. Photosynthesis and transpiration were measured using an infra-red gas analyzer. Leaf reflectance in an integrating sphere was determined using a spectrometer.\nLeaf temperature was maintained close to or below air temperature and was always lower than the fake (non-transpiring leaf). Different genetic lines maintained different leaf temperatures, especially during peak temperature in the mid afternoon. The variance in leaf temperature is explored in relation to its effects on transpiration, photosynthesis and growth across isoprene and non-isoprene emitting trees.",

            "abstract": "Ice giants remain largely unexplored, as their large distance from the Sun limits both Earth-based observations and spacecraft visits. The significant occurrence of ice giant-sized planets among detected exoplanets presents an impetus to study Uranus to understand planetary formation, dynamics, and evolution. In addition, Uranus is also uniquely interesting, given the large inclination of its rotation axis and magnetospheric configuration. In this work, we design a mission concept that aims to maximize scientific return by measuring Uranus’ chemical composition, internal structure, and magnetosphere, the first two being primary indicators of ice giant formation mechanisms.\nFor this study, we analyze the trade space for a Uranus mission constrained by a cost cap of $1B. We discuss the decision making processes behind our choices of the science priorities, instrument suite and orbital configuration. Trade space decisions include a strong onboard instrument suite in lieu of a descent probe, an orbiter instead of a flyby mission, and design constraints on the power and propulsion systems. The mission, CAELUS (Core and Atmospheric Evolution Laboratory for Uranus Science), is designed for an August 2023 launch. Following a 14-year cruise with multiple planetary gravity assists, the spacecraft would begin its science mission, which consists of a series of ten 30-day near-polar orbits around Uranus.\nThe instrument suite would consist of a microwave radiometer, Doppler seismometer, magnetometer, and UV spectrometer. These four instruments, along with a high-gain antenna capable of gravity science, would provide a comprehensive science return that meets the bulk of the scientific objectives of the 2013 NRC Planetary Science Decadal Survey for ice giants, most notably those regarding the chemical composition, interior structure, and dynamo of Uranus. This mission concept was created as part of an educational exercise for the 2014 Planetary Science Summer School at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.",

            "abstract": "Differentiating between geodynamic models describing the formation mechanism(s) of the central Andean plateau (CAP) requires information concerning the timing and location of basin formation, crustal deformation, and surface uplift. All models involve the removal of lithospheric mantle, and typically fall into one of two end-members: 1) slow, continuous uplift (km over 10s of Myr) involving protracted removal of mantle lithosphere through ablative subduction or thermal weakening that is predicted to be coincident with crustal shortening, or 2) punctuated uplift (km over Myr) driven by rapid wholesale or piecemeal foundering of a dense lithospheric root, likely post-dating major crustal shortening. However, these models are not mutually exclusive, nor must any one geodynamic mechanism describe the entire history of the formation of the CAP, an area spanning ~1800 km N-S by up to 500 km E-W, comprised of multiple physiographic regions of differing compositional and geophysical characteristics resulting from protracted orogenesis.\nWe present new stratigraphic, stable isotopic, and geochronologic data for temporally overlapping yet spatially separate Cenozoic intermontane basins in the northern CAP to evaluate the contribution of these end-member scenarios to the formation of the CAP. Data span multiple physiographic regions of the CAP, including basins near Puquio (Western Cordillera), the Huacochullo basin (western Altiplano margin), and the Macusani and Crucero basins of the Cordillera de Carabaya (Eastern Cordillera). The magnitude of paleoelevation changes is reconstructed from δD values of volcanic glass, while timing is constrained by zircon U-Pb geochronology. Initial results indicate early, rapid, high-magnitude surface uplift from initially low elevations in the Western Cordillera but a later, lower-magnitude pulse of uplift from initially moderate elevations in the Eastern Cordillera. This diachronous uplift history, together with published reports of crustal deformation, suggests contrasting uplift mechanisms potentially explained by early Miocene foundering of a dense lithospheric root in the Western Cordillera, and a combination of continued Cenozoic crustal shortening and late Miocene lithospheric removal in the Eastern Cordillera.",

            "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are key players in the biogeochemistry of the ocean, where they serve a critical role in the cycling of carbon and metals. Research in the past decade has introduced phytoplankton and, most recently, heterotrophic bacteria as significant sources of ROS, including superoxide, within both photic and aphotic regions of the ocean. ROS are both beneficial and detrimental to life. For instance, superoxide is a vital inter- and intra-cellular signaling molecule, yet at high concentrations it induces lipid peroxidation and initiates programmed cell death (PCD). In fact, superoxide has been implicated in PCD in the nitrogen-fixing diazotroph Trichodesmium, presumably leading to the demise of blooms within oligotrophic marine systems. Here, we explore the rates of superoxide production and decay by natural Trichodesmium populations obtained from various surface waters in the Sargasso Sea. We investigate also the role of light and colony density and morphology (puff v. raft) on superoxide fluxes. We find that Trichodesmium colonies produce extracellular superoxide at extremely high rates in the dark that are on par with those of the toxic raphidophyte Chattonella. The rates of superoxide production, however, rapidly decline with increasing cell density pointing to a role for superoxide in cell signaling in these organisms. We also find extremely rapid extracellular superoxide degradation by Trichodesmium. Together, this likely reflects a need for these organisms to maintain ROS at levels that will support signaling but below the threshold level that triggers PCD or oxidative damage. We also show differences in the effect of light on superoxide fluxes as a function of Trichodesmium colony morphology, suggesting differences in either colony physiology or associated bacterial symbionts. These findings point to complex physiological, ecological, and physical influences on ROS dynamics in phytoplankton that require further exploration.",

            "abstract": "Previous GPS studies have shown that the island of Hispaniola is a 250 km-wide zone of active, east-west, left-lateral shearing along two major strike-slip zones: the Septentrional-Oriente fault zone through the northern part of the island and the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone (EPGFZ) through the southern part of the island. The total interplate rate distributed on both faults is 21 mm/yr. Using a high-resolution DEM, we constructed fluvial channel profiles across transpression-related folds of late Miocene to recent age in the area of central and southern Dominican Republic and Haiti to determine controls of areas of relatively high, moderate, and slow uplift inferred from fluvial channel profiles. Fold axes in this area extend for 50-150 km and exhibit two different trends: 1) folds that occupy the area of the Sierra de Neiba-Chaine des Matheux north of the Enriquillo-Cul-de-Sac Valley and EPGFZ and folds that occupy the area of the Sierra de Bahoruco-Massif de la Selle all exhibit more east-west fold axes trending 110; 2) folds that occupy the area northwest of the EPGFZ in the western Chaine des Matheux and Sierra de Neiba all exhibit fold axes with more northwest trends of 125. River channel profiles show that the second group of more northwesterly-trending fold axes show relatively higher rates of tectonic uplift based on their convex-upward river profiles. Our interpretation for regional variations in river profiles and inferred uplift is that uplift is more pronounced on fold axes trending 15 degrees more to the northwest because their axes are more oblique to the interplate direction of east-west shearing. Longterm uplift rates previously measured from a stairstep of late Quaternary coral terraces at the plunging nose of the westernmost Chaine des Matheux have been previously shown to be occurring at a rate of 0.19 mm/yr. Onland exposures of Holocene corals are found only on one locality within the southern area of folds 30 km west of the epicenter of the 2010 Mw 7.0 Haiti earthquake. This emerged Holocene coral terrace - a unique marine Holocene exposure in the northern Caribbean - is directly adjacent to the Tapion Hill restraining bend-related anticline on the main trace of the EPGFZ.",

A challenge confronting reservoir operators today is how to incorporate both climate and streamflow products into their operations and which of these forecast products are most informative and useful for optimized water management. This study incorporates several reforecast products provided by the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center (CBRFC) which allows a complete retrospective analysis of climate forecasts, resulting in an evaluation of each product’s skill in the context of water resources management.\nThe accuracy and value of forecasts generated from the Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) are compared to the accuracy and value of using an Ensemble Streamflow Predictions (ESP) approach. Using the CFSv2 may offer more insight when responding to climate driven extremes than the ESP approach because the CFSv2 incorporates a fully coupled climate model into its forecasts rather than using all of the historic climate record as being equally probable. The role of forecast updating frequency will also be explored.\nDecision support systems (DSS) for both Salt Lake City Parley’s System and the Snohomish County Public Utility Department’s (SnoPUD) Jackson project will be used to illustrate the utility of forecasts. Both DSS include a coupled simulation and optimization model that will incorporate system constraints, operating policies, and environmental flow requirements. To determine the value of the reforecast products, performance metrics meaningful to the managers of each system are to be identified and quantified. Without such metrics and awareness of seasonal operational nuances, it is difficult to identify forecast improvements in meaningful ways. These metrics of system performance are compared using the different forecast products to evaluate the potential benefits of using CFSv2 seasonal forecasts in systems decision making.",

Areas we are focusing on include data mining, suitable research questions, data sets to compare with Globe at Night, and analysis tools, as well as how best to engage teachers and students in the research.\nGlobe at Night, a citizen-science program on monitoring light pollution, has a database with the potential to connect with factors embedded in NGSS: students could construct explanations and design solutions to light pollution issues, engage in argument from evidence and obtain, evaluate and communicate information. Projects could be multidisciplinary in nature, connecting the effects of light pollution on human health, wildlife, energy consumption and astronomy. We welcome feedback to help determine the direction and emphasis for the next phase of Globe at Night.\nThe presentation will include the nature of the research in the context of NGSS, building on frameworks being developed with the Cornell Ornithology Lab, the National Park Service (NPS) and Fieldscope. NPS staff have the means to make a contiguous map of light pollution across the U.S.. Fieldscope staff are developing the analysis tools online.

            "abstract": "Substorm onset is a dynamical response of the MI coupling system to external solar wind driving conditions and to internal dynamical processes. During the growth phase, the solar wind energy and momentum are transferred into the magnetosphere via MHD mesoscale Alfvenic interactions throughout the magnetopause current sheet. A decrease in momentum transfer from the solar wind into the magnetosphere starts a preconditioning stage, and produces a strong earthward body force acting on the whole magnetotail within a short time period. The strong earthward force will cause localized transients in the tail, such as multiple BBFs, DFs, plasma bubbles, and excited MHD waves. On auroral flux tubes, FACs carried by Alfven waves are generated by Alfvenic interactions between tail earthward flows associated with BBFs/DFs/Bubbles and the ionospheric drag. Nonlinear Alfvenic interaction between the incident and reflected Alfven wave packets in the auroral acceleration region can produce localized parallel electric fields and substorm auroral arcs.\nDuring the preconditioning stage prior to substorm onset, the generation of parallel electric fields and auroral arcs can redistribute perpendicular mechanical and magnetic stresses, “decoupling” the magnetosphere from the ionosphere drag. This will enhance the tail earthward flows and rapidly build up stronger parallel electric fields in the auroral acceleration region, leading to a sudden and violent tail energy release and substorm auroral poleward expansion. We suggest that in preconditioning stage, the decrease in the solar wind momentum transfer is a necessary condition of the substorm onset. Additionally, “decoupling” the magnetosphere from ionosphere drag can trigger substorm expansion onset.",

            "abstract": "Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) ecosystems store more carbon than non-ectomycorrhizal ecosystems at global scale. Recent theoretical and empirical work suggests the presence of ECM fungi allows plants to compete directly with decomposers for soil nitrogen (N) via exo-enzyme synthesis. Experimental ECM exclusion often results in a release from competition of saprotrophic decomposers, allowing for increased C-degrading enzyme production, increased microbial biomass, and eventually declines in soil C stocks. Our knowledge of this phenomenon is limited, however, to the presence or absence of ECM fungi. It remains unknown if competitive repression of saprotrophic microbes and soil C cycling by ECM fungi varies with ECM abundance. This is particularly relevant to global change experiments when manipulations alter plant C allocation to ECM symbionts. To test if variation in ECM abundance alters the competitive inhibition of saprotrophic soil microbes (quantitative inhibition) we established experimental ECM exclusion treatments along an ECM abundance gradient. We dug trenches to experimentally exclude ECM fungi, allowing us to test for competitive release of soil saprotrophs from competition. To control for disturbance we placed in-growth bags both inside and outside of trenches.\nConsistent with the quantitative inhibition hypothesis, sites with more ECM fungi had significantly less microbial biomass per unit soil C and lower rates of N mineralization. Consistent with a release from competition, C-degrading enzyme activities were higher and gross proteolytic rates were lower per unit microbial biomass inside compared to outside trenches. We interpret this to reflect increased microbial investment in C-acquisition and decreased investment in N-acquisition in the absence of ECM fungi. Furthermore, the increase in C-degrading enzymes per unit microbial biomass was significantly greater in sites with the most abundant ECM fungi. Based on these results, ECM-saprotroph competition does appear to slow soil C cycling and the effect is quantitative. Soil C cycling is at least partly controlled by interactions between ECM fungi and soil saprotrophs. Environmental change that alters ECM abundance may thus alter soil C stocks by ameliorating or exacerbating plant-decomposer competition for nitrogen.",

            "abstract": "In this presentation we will report on our first observations of energetic electron flux from inside thunderclouds. Energetic electrons can produce high-energy radiation. High-energy radiation is routinely produced by thunderclouds and lightning. This radiation is in the form of x-rays and gamma-rays with timescales ranging from sub-microsecond (x-rays associated with lightning leaders), to sub-millisecond (Terrestrial Gamma ray Flashes), to minute long glows (Gamma-ray Glows from thunderclouds seen on the ground and in or near the cloud by aircrafts and balloons). It is generally accepted that these emissions originate from bremsstrahlung interactions of relativistic runaway electrons with air, which can be accelerated in the thundercloud/lightning electric fields and gain up to multi-MeV energies. However, the exact physical details of the mechanism that produces these runaway electrons are still unknown.\nOur balloon-borne campaign at Florida Tech is intended to directly measure the flux of energetic electrons inside thunderclouds. Each balloon carries two Geiger counters to record the energetic particles. Geiger counters are well suited for directly measuring energetic electrons and positrons and have the advantage of being lightweight and dependable. Data from our payloads are saved onboard and also get transmitted in real time to our ground station at a transmission rate of 115.2 kb/s. This would provide us a high resolution radiation profile over a relatively large distance.\nThis work was supported in part by the NASA grant NNX12A002H and by DARPA grant HR0011-1-10-1-0061.",

            "abstract": "A global top-down study of Black Carbon (BC) Emissions has found that sources are considerably higher than present day emissions datasets, with most of this underestimation stemming from the rapidly developing areas of East and Southeast Asia. An additional source in these regions is the frequent and sometimes annual influence of extreme biomass burning events, which emit additional BC and other aerosols into the atmosphere. An additional top-down study has shown that the emissions of BC from these biomass burning events in Southeast Asia contribute an additional 30% increase in the annual average BC emissions, and an additional 110% increase during the highest fire year. One important reason for this underestimation is that many of these source regions do not appear as fires, due to missing MODIS overpasses, intense cloud cover, and low fire temperatures at the wet surface.\nThese new temporally and spatially varying emissions of BC are run in a state-of-the art combined model of aerosol physics, chemistry, and general circulation, including urban scale chemical processing and core/shell aerosol mixture impacts on radiation. The results reveal that this new dataset matches in space, time, and magnitude, an array of observations (remotely sensed, ground, and column) far better than other emission datasets: IPCC SRES, AEROCOM, BOND, and GFED.\nThe modeled mean atmospheric extinction and loading are both much higher and more variable than previous modelling efforts, leading to a larger negative surface radiative forcing. At the same time, atmospheric absorption is enhanced and more variable, leading to intense atmospheric heating, with the average impact from 1.0-1.5 W/m2. This has impacts on the vertical stability in the source areas, and leads to changes in the dynamics such as a shifting of the ITCZ, reducing light precipitation and increasing strong convection. To support this, a bit of measurement-based evidence presented for each of these phenomena.",

            "abstract": "Trace amounts of water, present as protons structurally bound in olivine crystal defects, are inferred to significantly enhance the low-strain solid-state viscoelastic relaxation responsible for attenuation and dispersion of seismic waves in the upper mantle. This inferrence is supported by recent observation of water weakening at moderate compressive strains in synthetic, water-undersaturated aggregates (Faul et al., in preparation). In these fine-grained olivine polycrystals of Fo90 composition, doped with 0.02wt% TiO2, “water” is incorporated in the remarkably stable Ti-clinohumite defect. Such synthetic olivine specimens reproduce the infrared spectra of natural mantle olivines (Berry et al., 2005), and present the advantage of being melt-free and of low dislocation density. The water contents in such synthetic polycrystalline olivine aggregates, which can be quantitatively measured by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), range up to 90 ppm, and are thus representative of water-undersaturated conditions in the upper mantle. We will report here the outcome of torsional-oscillation tests,in which attenuation and shear modulus were measured at seismic frequencies (mHz-Hz) and various temperatures up to 1300C on Pt-encapsulated, Ti-doped olivine specimens, enclosed within a mild-steel jacket.",

            "abstract": "The rates and processes of energy transfer in water-filled cavities formed under glaciers by geothermal and volcanic activity has been investigated by designing, developing, and using an experimental setup in which hot water jets can impinge on an ice block. Systematic sets of experimental runs typically lasting 60-90 seconds with water jet temperatures in the range 10° - 90°C have been performed with initial ice block temparature. It is quantitatively found that heat flux from flowing water to ice is linearly dependent on temperature of the jet flow. The hot water jet meltes out a cavity into the ice block during the process. The cavities had steep to vertical sides with a doming roof. Some of the ice blocks used had trapped air bubbles. In these cases melting of the ice lead to the trapping of air at the top of the cavity, partially insulating the roof from the hot water jet. Such cavities had lower aspect ratios (height/width) and flatter and less dome shaped roofs than did cavities in ice blocks with little or no air bubbles. The overall heat transfer rate in cavity formation varied with jet temperature from <100 kW m-2 to ~900 kW m-2 while melting rates in the vertical direction yield heat transfer rates of 200-1200 kW m-2. The observed experimental heat transfer rates can be compared to data on subglacial melting observed for ice cauldrons in various settings in Iceland. For the lowest experimental temperatures the numbers are comparable to those found for geothermal water in cool, subglacial water bodies and above subglacial flowpaths of jökulhlaups. However, the highest experimental rates for 80-90°C jets are 3-10 times less than inferred from observations of recent subglacial eruptions (2000-4000 kW m-2). This can indicate that single phase liquid water convection alone is not sufficient to explain the rates seen in recent subglacial eruptions in Iceland, suggesting that during such eruptions forced two-phase (liquid and steam) or three phase (liquid, steam and pyroclasts) convection is common. Further recommendations may also be presented for future research in this field.",

Understanding how these perturbations have altered climate and in turn neotropical biodiversity require several steps, including the understanding of all physical mechanisms involved. Here we use the fully coupled general circulation model (GCM) IPSL-CM4 to quantify the impact of the uplift of the Andes and the closure of the CAS on global and regional climate, including Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and South American temperature and rainfall patterns. A simulation with lower Andes helps understanding how the mechanical effect of this barrier affects surface winds and in turn, freshwater balances over the ocean and associated sea surface temperatures. In a second experiment, we include the continental effect of the Andean uplift, i.e. the changes in river routing within the Amazon basin and modified location of its freshwater outflow to the ocean, and show that mechanical and hydrological effects of the uplift are not acting in the same direction. Lastly, as the spatial resolution of GCMs can hardly be reconciled with the geographical scale required for paleobiogeographical studies, we suggest new methods to downscale climatic layers and bridge the gaps between large-scale models and intracontinental biotic studies.",

Even the X-band radar realizes the resolution of 250 m or larger. Here we suggest a new super dense observation network with simple and low cost sensors that can be used for measurement both of raindrop and vertical electric field change caused by cloud-to-ground lightning discharge. This sensor consists of two aluminum plates with a diameter of 10-20 cm. We carried out an observation campaign in summer of 2013 in the foothills of Mt. Yastugatake, Yamanashi and Nagano prefectures in Japan, installing 6 plate-type sensors at a distance of about 4 km. Horizontal location, height and charge amount of each lightning discharge are estimated successfully based on the information of electric field changes at several observing sites. Moreover, it was found that the thunderstorm has a very narrow structure well smaller than 300 m that cannot be measured by any other ways, counting the positive and negative pulses caused by attachment of raindrop to the sensor plate, respectively. We plan to construct a new super dense observation network in the north Kanto region, Japan, where the lightning activity is most prominent in summer Japan, distributing more than several tens of sensors at every 4 km or shorter, such as an order of 100 m at minimum. This kind of new type network will reveal the unknown fine structures of thunderstorms and open the door for constructing real time alert system of torrential rainfall and lightning stroke especially in the city area.",

Here, we revisit the oldest part of the EDC CO2 record using different air extraction methods and sections of the core. For our standard system, we found an analytical artifact, which increases over the deepest 200 m and reaches 10.1±2.4 ppm in the oldest/deepest part. The mechanism behind is not unambiguously known yet, but it is related to insufficient gas extraction of our standard system, suboptimal storage of one section of the core, and structural changes of the ice with depth. Based on the re-measurements presented here we derive a correction for the original data to account for the analytical bias and revisit previous conclusions drawn from the biased data by Lüthi et al. (2008). First, the record low CO2 concentration ever found in an ice core in the period MIS 16 still remains as such, but requires slight correction by 2 ppm. Second, the period from MIS 16 to 19 as a whole does not show anymore unexpected low CO2 concentrations as expected from the CO2-temperature relation of MIS 1 to 15.

            "abstract": "Dense urbanization has resulted in the “disappearance” of many local creeks in urbanized areas surrounding the San Francisco Bay. Long reaches of creeks now flow in underground pipes. Municipalities and water agencies trying to reduce non-point-source pollution are faced with a public that cannot see and therefore does not understand the interconnected nature of the drainage system or its ultimate discharge to the bay. Since 1993, we have collaborated with the Oakland Museum, the San Francisco Estuary Institute, public agencies, and municipalities to create creek and watershed maps to address the need for public understanding of watershed concepts. Fifteen paper maps are now published (\nwww.museumca.org/creeks\n), which have become a standard reference for educators and anyone working on local creek-related issues.\nWe now present digital interactive creek and watershed maps in Google Earth. Four maps are completed covering urbanized areas of Santa Clara and Alameda Counties. The maps provide a 3D visualization of the watersheds, with cartography draped over the landscape in transparent colors. Each mapped area includes both Present and Past (circa 1800s) layers which can be clicked on or off by the user. The Present layers include the modern drainage network, watershed boundaries, and reservoirs. The Past layers include the 1800s-era creek systems, tidal marshes, lagoons, and other habitats. All data are developed in ArcGIS software and converted to Google Earth format. To ensure the maps are interesting and engaging, clickable icons pop-up provide information on places to visit, restoration projects, history, plants, and animals. Maps of Santa Clara Valley are available at http://www.valleywater.org/WOW.aspx. Maps of western Alameda County will soon be available at http://acfloodcontrol.org/.\nDigital interactive maps provide several advantages over paper maps. They are seamless within each map area, and the user can zoom in or out, and tilt, and fly over to explore any area of interest. They can be easily customized, for example, adding placemarks or notes. Enrichment information can be added, using clickable icons, without cluttering the map. Best, the maps are fun to use. Digital interactive maps will be another effective tool for enhancing public understanding of urban creeks & watersheds.",

            "abstract": "The duration and severity of drought has been predicted to increase with climate change. Understanding vegetation response to protracted drought is important to predict their future response and develop adaptive management strategies. We examined the transpiration of Eucalyptus regnans forest at the end of the Millennium Drought, which affected southeast Australia from the mid-1990s to 2009. The forested catchment, Crotty Creek, has been subjected to a strip-thinning treatment in the early 1980s. Measurements of sap flow were conducted using the compensation heat pulse technique over 13 months from December 2009. Transpiration appeared to be energy-limited rather than water-limited, with daily maximum VPD and solar radiation being good predictors of sap flux density. The perennial streamflow and unlimited transpiration at the end of the drought indicate a large soil-water buffer in the system. The post-thinning evapotranspiration (ET) of the catchment was likely to be lower than ET of an undisturbed catchment with similar stand age (70-year old) due to the lower post-thinning basal area. In contrast to this, the streamflow of a dryer, 34-year old mixed eucalypt forest ceased for several months during the same drought. Thus, the resilience of E. regnans forests during a severe drought may depend on the soil-water buffer and stomatal control, while silvicultural treatment may help reduce water stress in dryer and younger forests.",

Epiphytic lichens and mosses respond sensitively to both direct and indirect effects of global change, as evidenced by distinct changes in epiphyte community structure. Yet, few studies have explored how shifting epiphytic communities, resulting from changing climate and increasing air pollutant exposure, may greatly impact biogeochemical cycles of the forests they inhabit. We present the first study investigating how urbanization, as a proxy for global change, impacts epiphytic community structure and functional biodiversity and address the impending effects on Pacific Northwest forest biogeochemical cycles. We discuss the results of paired ground and arboreal epiphyte surveys across an urban to rural gradient in Portland, Oregon. Three research sites with varying distance (0km, 74km, and 109km) from urban center were surveyed and epiphytic biodiversity was described. Pronounced shifts in epiphyte community structure were observed downwind of the Portland metro region. These results suggest that the impacts of urbanization may have significant and surprisingly far-reaching impacts on forested ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest. The impacts of an altered ground and arboreal epiphytic community on Pacific Northwest forest biogeochemical processes will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "For hundreds of years, humans have altered river flow regimes all over the world with the construction of dams for hydropower generation, water supply, irrigation, navigation, and other reasons. Reservoirs resulting from dams usually have a high impact on the surrounding area by permanently flooding riparian habitat, changing river flow dynamics and soil moisture, disturbing riverine activities and fish migration, imposing the relocation of human settlements, and increasing methane emission due to submerged organic matter. The representation of these anthropogenic activities in numerical models has been the subject of several studies. However, access to reservoir operational data is often limited, preventing us from developing a consistent global scale river flow dynamic model and its physical interactions with the atmosphere and soil.\nRecent advances in radar altimetry (RA) data acquisition enable us to accurately monitor reservoirs in regions where distribution to information has long been restricted due to data share policies. In this study, we evaluate the potential of integrating RA data into reservoir operational modeling. Spaceborne remotely sensed data collected by the Envisat radar altimeter (2002-2010), IceSAT GLAS lidar (2003-2009), and daily inflow, outflow and water elevation data collected in situ since 2005 have been analyzed across 28 reservoirs on various Brazilian rivers. Changes in the reservoir surface water elevation from each of these data sources are compared and differences are examined with respect to seasonality and accuracy. A reservoir operation algorithm capable of integrating RA data is presented and evaluated. We discuss prospects and challenges for implementing the algorithm in a global-scale river routing scheme in order to improve our process-level understanding on river dynamics and variability.",

            "abstract": "Plants cover the majority of Earth’s land surface, and thus play a critical role in the surface energy balance. Within individual plant communities, the leaf energy balance is a fundamental component of most biophysical processes. Absorbed radiation drives the energy balance and provides the means by which plants produce food. Available energy is partitioned into sensible and latent heat fluxes to determine surface temperature, which strongly influences rates of metabolic activity and growth. The energy balance of an individual leaf is coupled with other leaves in the community through longwave radiation emission and advection through the air. This complex coupling can make scaling models from leaves to whole-canopies difficult, specifically in canopies with complex, heterogeneous geometries. We present a new three-dimensional canopy model that simultaneously resolves sub-tree to whole-canopy scales. The model provides spatially explicit predictions of net radiation exchange, boundary-layer and stomatal conductances, evapotranspiration rates, and ultimately leaf surface temperature. The radiation model includes complex physics such as anisotropic emission and scattering. Radiation calculations are accelerated by leveraging graphics processing unit (GPU) technology, which allows canopy-scale problems to be performed on a standard desktop workstation. Since validating the three-dimensional distribution of leaf temperature can be extremely challenging, we used several independent measurement techniques to quantify errors in measured and modeled values. When compared with measured leaf temperatures, the model gave a mean error of about 2°C, which was close to the estimated measurement uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "Coupling between the Himalayan-Tibetan uplift and intense Asian monsoon yields tremendous regional runoff and sediment supply. This vigorous mass-transfer system sustains 7 of the world’s 10 largest riverine sediment loads, which in turn have constructed vast, fertile fluvial-deltaic lowlands. These environments across south and east Asia host about 1/3 of all people on Earth. Such large and dense populations have flourished amidst the region’s generally abundant water supplies, fisheries, and agricultural production. Yet the same environmental attributes that are so rich in resources also define a uniquely dynamic region, where rates of change are rapid and punctuated by frequent, intense events. Indeed, 8 of the world’s 10 deadliest natural disasters have occurred in this region, involving a combination of earthquakes, tropical cyclones, river floods, and tsunamis. Other stresses that regularly impact the region include periods of monsoon collapse and drought, widespread arsenic contamination of groundwater, relative sea-level rise and coastal inundation, and groundwater salinization.\nThus the communities of this region persistently face the challenge of balancing the carrying capacity of a resource-rich environment with its associated hazards and challenges. One important concept that has become increasingly more apparent is the connection within watersheds that transmits local effects both upstream and downstream within the system. Here we emphasize two additional points that we believe are essential in developing plausible strategies for sustaining health, resilience, and stability of the region. First, problems related to the natural environment are closely coupled with human activities and our concurrent responses to environmental change. Thus resulting issues are complex and multifaceted in ways that require natural scientists to better engage with researchers in the humanities and social sciences. Second, despite similar risks affecting many millions of square kilometers, the impacts of, and solutions to, such risk necessarily play out at much smaller scales closer to tens to a few hundred kilometers. This scaling includes both the natural and human landscape, underscoring the need to account for local variation in our scientific investigations.",

The Southern Ocean south of 30°S, occupying just over ¼ of the surface ocean area, accounts for a disproportionate share of the vertical exchange of properties between the deep and surface waters of the ocean and between the surface ocean and the atmosphere; thus this region can be disproportionately influential on the climate system. Despite the crucial role of the Southern Ocean in the climate system, understanding of the particular mechanisms involved remains inadequate, and the model studies underlying many of these results are highly controversial. As part of the overall goal of working toward reducing uncertainties in climate projections, we present an analysis using new data/model metrics based on a unified framework of theory, quantitative datasets, and numerical modeling. These new metrics quantify the mechanisms, processes, and tendencies relevant to the role of the Southern Ocean in climate.",

However, the interpretation and application of the PRI can be confounded because of its sensitivity to several variables changing at the diurnal (e.g., irradiation, shadow fraction) and seasonal (e.g., leaf area, chlorophyll and carotene pigment concentrations, irradiation) time scales. We explored different techniques to correct the PRI for variations in canopy structure and relative chlorophyll content (ChlR) using highly temporally resolved (frequency = five minutes) in-situ radiometric measurements of PRI and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) over eight soft white spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)field plots under varying nitrogen and soil water conditions over two seasons. Our results suggest that the influence of seasonal variation in canopy ChlR and LAI on the diurnally measured PRI (PRIdiurnal) can be minimized using simple correction techniques, therefore improving the strength of PRI as a tool to quantify abiotic stressors such as daily changes in soil volumetric water content (SVWC), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). PRIdiurnal responded strongly to available nitrogen, and linearly tracked seasonal changes in SVWC, VPD, and stomatal conductance (gc). Utilizing the PRI as an indicator of stress, yield predictions significantly over greenness indices such as the NDVI. This study provides insight towards the future interpretation and scaling of PRI to quantify rapid changes in photosynthesis, and as an indicator of plant stress.",

            "abstract": "On 5 September 2012, a major megathrust earthquake (Mw=7.6) ruptured the plate interface beneath the Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica. This event was centered 12 km offshore of the central Nicoya coast, at a depth of 18 km. The maximum slip exceeded 2 meters, and the rupture spread outward along the plate interface to encompass 3000 km2 of the Nicoya seismogenic zone. More than 1700 aftershocks were recorded within the first 5 days. These aftershocks outlined two distinct rupture patches; one centered on the central coast and the other beneath the southern tip of the peninsula.\nWe formulate a Bayesian inverse problem to infer the coseismic slip on the fault plane based on instantaneous surface displacements and changes in well heads in order to image the remaining “locked” patch that has been inferred previously. We compute the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the posterior slip distribution on the fault, and use a local Gaussian approximation around the MAP point to characterize the uncertainty. The elastic deformation is computed using a finite element method that allows for the spatial variation of elastic properties that has been observed in the crust overlying the seismogenic zone. We solve the optimization problem using gradients obtained from adjoints. The linearity of the inverse problem allows for the efficient solution of the optimal experimental design problem for the placement of the GPS stations to monitor the remaining locked patch. In the future, the results obtained here will provide the initial condition for a time-dependent poroelastic model for fault slip and fluid migration due to overpressure caused by a megathrust earthquake. This will provide constraints on the crustal permeability structure in a tectonically active region.",

            "abstract": "The Tibetan Plateau (TP) has fundamental ecological and environmental significance to China and Asia through its influence on regional and continental climates. In recent years, climate warming has caused unprecedented changes to land surface processes on the TP, which would unavoidably undermine the ecological and environmental functions of the TP. Among the numerous land surface processes potentially impacted by climate warming, the effect of vegetation greenness on surface energy balance is one of the most critical, but has been long ignored. In this study, we investigated the spatial and temporal patterns of land surface albedo (LSA) on the TP and evaluated the vegetation greenness in relation to patterns of LSA. We found that LSA has been decreasing in most of the vegetated grasslands on the TP from 2000 to 2013, as compared to a flat trend for desert area. The regions where LSA has been decreasing were spatially correlated to areas of increased vegetation greenness. Along rising altitude, LSA decreasing rate exhibited an overall decreasing trend. Across the TP, elevated vegetation greenness in grasslands acted as a primary factor pulling down LSA. The driving effects of vegetation greenness on LSA vary with grassland types, as revealed by a more significant relationship between vegetation greenness and LSA for the sparsely vegetated zone (i.e. steppe) than the more densely vegetated zone (i.e. meadow). Furthermore, the driving effect of vegetation greenness on LSA exhibited an obvious dependence on altitude as effects with rising altitude were relatively strong up to 3,000m, then weakened from 3,500m to 5,000m, and then the effects again increased from 5,000 to 6,000m. The growing season LSA trend revealed in this study emphasizes the need to give greater attention to the growing season LSA flux in future surface energy balance studies.",

CE 1000 and warmer conditions in the 16th and 17th centuries. The search for climatic forcers in northern Alaska relies on integration of data drawn from tree-rings, lacustrine varves and moraines, diatoms, beach ridges and dunes. At Cape Espenberg, northern Seward Peninsula, a 1500-year reconstruction of settlement, landscape evolution and climatic variability employs >100 14C ages from accreting dunes with shell-laden storm beds, intercalated driftwood and superimposed soils, archaeological sites and marsh peats within swale ponds. Large storms occurred along the Chukchi Sea from Cape Espenberg and Deering (Kotzebue Sound) to Point Barrow prior to 1000 CE, and at decadal intervals during the Little Ice Age (LIA) from 1300 to 1700. Architecural driftwood logs from several excavated houses capped by sand dunes yield several 14C dated floating chronologies covering intervals from 700 to 1700, suggest the identification of cooler intervals 800 to 1000 and intermittently after 1300. Peat aggradation followed isolation from the sea from 500 onward, and was interrupted by two pulses of fresh water, one ca. 1300 and a second ca. 1800, with diatoms suggesting relative aridity during the LIA. The occupation history of Cape Espenberg generally follows dune growth, and may be inversely related to cooler temperatures.",

            "abstract": "The IPCC produces scientific reports out of findings on climate and climate change. Because the findings are uncertain in many respects, the production of reports requires aggregating assessments of uncertainties of different kinds. This difficult task is currently regulated by the Guidance note for lead authors of the IPCC fifth assessment report on consistent treatment of uncertainties. The note recommends that two metrics—i.e. confidence and likelihood— be used for communicating the degree of certainty in findings. Confidence is expressed qualitatively “based on the type, amount, quality, and consistency of evidence […] and the degree of agreement”, while likelihood is expressed probabilistically “based on statistical analysis of observations or model results, or expert judgment”. Therefore, depending on the evidence evaluated, authors have the choice to present either an assigned level of confidence or a quantified measure of likelihood. But aggregating assessments of uncertainties of these two different kinds express distinct and conflicting methodologies. So the question arises whether the treatment of uncertainties in the IPCC is rationally justified. In order to answer the question, it is worth comparing the IPCC procedures with the formal normative theories of epistemic rationality which have been developed by philosophers. These theories—which include contributions to the philosophy of probability and to bayesian probabilistic confirmation theory—are relevant for our purpose because they are commonly used to assess the rationality of common collective jugement formation based on uncertain knowledge. In this paper we make the comparison and pursue the following objectives: i/we determine whether the IPCC confidence and likelihood can be compared with the notions of uncertainty targeted by or underlying the formal normative theories of epistemic rationality; ii/we investigate whether the formal normative theories of epistemic rationality justify treating uncertainty along those two dimensions, and indicate how this can be avoided.",

Though previous studies have proposed several hypotheses to explain the role of shallow clouds in the convective life cycle, our understanding on the role of shallow clouds is still premature. There are more questions needs to be addressed related to the role of different cloud population, conditions favorable for shallow to deep convection transitions, and their characteristics at different stages of the convective cloud life. The present study aims to improve the understanding of the shallow clouds by documenting the role of different shallow cloud population for the Year of Tropical Convection period using Atmospheric Radiation Measurement observations at the Tropical Western Pacific Manus site. The performance of the CAM5 model to simulate shallow clouds are tested using observed cloud statistics.",

            "abstract": "The West Tahoe Fault has a mapped length of 45 km, and its vertical slip rate is estimated at 0.6-1.0 mm/yr (Dingler et al., 2009). It is the range bounding, east dipping normal fault along the west margin of the basin, and the highest slip rate section is located along the western base of Lake Tahoe at a water depth of 400-500 m. In the lake, the fault has clearly defined scarps that displace submarine fans, lake-bottom sediments, and the ~50 ka age (Kent et al., 2005; Smith et al, 2013) McKinney Bay slide. Onshore the fault displaces tree-covered glacial and fluvial landforms.\nIn October 2013 we conducted the first trenching study of the geomorphically well-defined West Tahoe Fault. Using Lidar, we selected a site with fine-grained surface sediments, as opposed to the boulder-rich moraine sediments that cover most of the onshore fault. The site is located ~3.5 km from the southern end of the mapped fault, adjacent to Osgood Swamp. In the excavation, we observed an east-dipping, normal fault juxtaposing glacial deposits against datable peat-bearing and charcoal-rich younger alluvial sediments. The glacial deposits and peat layers can be matched across the fault. Clear evidence for two earthquakes was based on scarp-derived colluvium, fissures, faulted scarp-related alluvium, liquefaction, and upward terminations of faults. Retrodeformation of the sediments results in nearly equal vertical displacements of about 1.7 m/event. Results from multiple C-14 analysis place the most recent event at ~5.3 ka and the penultimate event at ~7.4 ka.\nThe fault scarp at the trench is 3.5 m high; at the bottom of the lake at a depth of 400 m a postulated same-age fan as the trench site post-glacial deposits, has a vertical scarp of 10-12 m. As expected the slip rate decreases towards the southern end of the fault. However, if the same number of events resulted in the underwater scarp then events must average about 5-6 m vertical displacement per event. This has serious implications for earthquake generated lake tsunamis and permanent shoreline subsidence.\nThese types of onshore results are needed to validate more established paleoseismic results from Lake Tahoe based on offshore methodologies: CHIRP seismic profiling, lake cores showing earthquake triggered turbidites and ROV dives.",

To that end, development of the Third National Climate Assessment included a focus on engaging users through an inclusive, broad-based, and sustained process. Such a process provides opportunities for scientific experts and decision makers to share knowledge about the climate-related issues, impacts, and potential response actions that are most important in a particular region or sector. Such a process is also highly transparent in order to produce results that are credible, salient, and legitimate for both scientists and decision makers, ultimately making the results extremely useful.\nTo implement these principles for the recent NCA, a broad-based engagement strategy was implemented from the start of the process. The strategy invited participation from users and stakeholder communities at each stage of the process, and considered methods for communicating with potential users at every step. The strategy was designed to elicit contributions to help shape the framing of the assessment, improve the transparency of the process, and increase the utility of the final information. Specific user inputs were gathered through a series of workshops, public comment opportunities, town hall meetings, presentations, requests for information, submitted documents, and open meetings. Further, a network of contributors self-organized around topics of interest to extend the NCA to a wider range of user groups. Here, we describe the outcomes of these innovations in assessment engagement and identify clear successes, notable surprises, future evaluation needs, and areas for new ideas.",

ASEPs are emitted into the environment in part or in total through human activities, are transported and processed in the environment, and often deposited in locations distant from their original use or release. This characteristic separation of use and harm limits the capacity of communities affected by ASEPs to mitigate them. Incomplete understanding of the dynamic behavior of these pollutants in the environment has resulted in efforts to regulate them that do not fully protect human and ecosystem health from risks. To demonstrate this characteristic separation of use and harm, we compare and contrast the role that biogeochemical cycling plays in the dynamic coupled human-natural ASEP system for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyl compounds, and mercury. We highlight remobilization effects related to land use and climate change, and demonstrate the ecosystem service provided by natural organic matter through sequestration of ASEPs in terrestrial environments.",

            "abstract": "Our knowledge about the spatial and temporal relationship between continental extension and its related magmatism is mainly from the western US where removal of a flat subducting slab from under the continent controlled thermal weakening and some extensional collapse. The Iranian plateau, where flat-slab subduction and its subsequent rollback is suggested for the Tertiary magmatic evolution, is an ideal place to see if a similar interaction exists.\nBetween the Late Cretaceous and, at least, the Early Eocene, large-scale continental extension affected the NE Iranian plateau. An ~100 km-long, SE tilted upper to mid-crustal section was exhumed by slip along a low-angle, NW-dipping detachment fault. From SE to NW (young to old) this section includes late Cretaceous pelagic limestones of the Kashmar ophiolites, Late and Early Cretaceous sedimentary rocks, and the Late Triassic and older crystalline rocks of the Biarjmand-Shotor Kuh metamorphic core complex. Little pre-extensional magmatic activity exists in the tilted sequence and in surrounding regions, as Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous dikes. Similarly, syn-extensional magmatism is absent. In contrast, the tilted sequence is unconformably overlain by >4000 m of volcanic rocks with age ranging from the Middle Eocene (explosive, calc-alkaline?) to the Late Eocene (effusive, alkaline).\nThe absence of considerable pre-extensional magmatism in the NE Iranian plateau does not support magma underplating, subsequent thermal weakening and collapse as a mechanism for the extension in this region. It also indicates that the models that consider waning of volcanism as a controlling mechanism for triggering of extensional faulting (Sonder & Jones, 1999) is not applicable for this region. The amagmatic extension may reflect magma crystallization at depth due to reduced confining pressure resulted from active normal faulting and fracturing (Gans & Bohrson, 1998). The extension and related asthenospheric rise may be developed in a back-arc system.",

Bennett Dam was created in the late 1960s, is the largest inland body of water in BC and facilitates hydroelectric power generation. Annually the reservoir level rises and lowers with the hydroelectric dam operation, and this combined with the inputs from several river systems (Upper Peace, Finlay, Parsnip, and several smaller creeks) renews suspended sediment sources. Several short-cores retrieved from shallow bays of the Finlay Basin reveal near-annual sedimentary units and distinct patterns related to both hydroclimate variability and the degree to which the reservoir lowered in a particular year. Thin section and sedimentology from short-cores collected in three bays are used to evaluate sediment mobilization processes. The primary sediment sources in each core location is linked to physical inputs from rivers draining into the bays, aeolian contributions, and reworked shoreline deposits as water levels fluctuate. Despite uniform water level lowering across the reservoir, sediment sequences differed at each site, reflecting the local stream inputs. However, distinct organic-rich units, facilitated correlation across the sites. Notable differences in particle size distributions from each core points to important aeolian derived sediment sources. Using these sedimentary records, we can evaluate the processes that contribute to sediment deposition in the basin.

            "abstract": "High-resolution hydrographic data, hydro-geochemical and isotopic analysis are combined to investigate the current hydrological functioning of the RAMSAR listed Lake Clifton, Western Australia, and potential threats to the lakes Thrombolite deposits. Water level and electrical conductivity data for lake, sub-surface and deep ground waters imply continued contribution by both rainfall and sub-surface water to Lake Clifton’s water balance. Approximately two years of local daily rainfall totals and four-hourly lake level measurements, indicate a two-phase lake recharge process with immediate contributions by direct rainfall, followed by a combination of surface runoff and sub-surface infiltration. δ18O and δ18H stable isotope analysis also indicates recharge contributions by sub-surface and ground waters. Spatial uniformity and seasonal fluctuations in the isotope signatures promote a well-mixed lake system dominated by evaporative processes. Increases in ionic concentrations and salinity in adjacent groundwater are starting to mimic surface water trends identified over the last few decades. Thus, with groundwater, sub-surface water, and rainfall continuing to contribute to the composition of the lake water, it is possible that changing sub-surface water chemistry could be a driver in observed shifts in the lakes geochemical - hydrological balance. Such changes could be driven by over–extraction of groundwater causing saline water intrusion and/or reduction in rainfall and as such local recharge. Decreased rainfall and increasing temperature is also likely to have a direct effect on increases in salinity and TDS in Lake Clifton. These factors together are ultimately threatening the existence of the thrombolite reef in the north-east corner of the Lake.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we reconstruct changes in precipitation using geochemical and grain size proxies and we look at how shelf morphology can influence the nature of sedimentary record of climate and oceanographic events. A 9.6m long sediment core from Sibuyan Sea basin within the internal seas of the Philippines, was raised from a water depth of 1660m. It was analyzed using an XRF core scanner at 1 cm resolution. Grain size was determined using a laser particle analyzer. Thirteen AMS radiocarbon dates from bulk organics provide age control spanning back to 14 kyBP. Overall, the trends of precipitation proxies Ti, Al and Al/Ti follow the 10o N insolation curve. A 1.4 ky periodicity rides on this general trend. But a stepwise decrease of these precipitation proxies occur at about 9ka and 4ka. The former correpond to the melt water pulse 1-c rapid sea level rise of about 15m while the latter correlates time-wise to a period of aridification. The Younger Dryas period, ca. 12.9-11.6 ka, another known dry period, does not show a shift or decrease in sediment input. Similarly, MWP -1B does no register a distinct signal in the core. The insensitivity of the core in reflecting the older climate and sea level events is attributed to the steep morphology of the sea floor where shoreline translations took place during the earlier sea level events; with a steeper sea floor, sediment sequestration near the shoreline will be low and therefore the basin will not feel much change in sediment input. For the younger climate and sea level events, the shoreline positions were already adjacent to sea floor with relatively gentler gradient where sediment sequestration is greater and where a sea level rise of a certain magnitude will translate the shoreline much farther.",

            "abstract": "Geologic carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a feasible solution to the international greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions problem and it has recently been called a \"vital\" mitigation tool by the International Energy Agency. However, there exists uncertainty concerning the terminal fate of stored carbon dioxide (CO2.) In this regard, reliable monitoring, verification and accounting (MVA) technologies are essential for making CCS publicly acceptable. Chiefly, MVA addresses safety and environmental concerns by providing a warning system to prevent or alleviate CO2 leakages. A secondary purpose of MVA technologies is to prove compliance with CO2 reduction standards through inventory verification. A key MVA tool for tracking CO2 leakages is surface (atmospheric) monitoring. Demonstrating its value, industry actors feel an impetus to invest in surface monitoring as a low-risk, high-value technology to mitigate liability in cases of potential leakages. Despite how necessary this tool is, to date, all surface monitoring mesh designs and best practices have been proposed locally, without discussion of standardization or optimization on a regional, national or international level. We identify the fundamental problem of surface monitoring mesh design as locating the monitoring sites to record CO2 levels over the designated geographic area at lowest cost with maximum impact. We approach this problem from both an operations research (OR) perspective and atmospheric dispersion perspective. From an OR perspective, we approach mesh design using multiobjective optimization models – we specify the relative placement of candidate sites, observation time interval, and optimality criteria. In the second approach, we model CO2 leakage scenarios to test the effectiveness of proposed mesh design from the first approach. We use atmospheric dispersion modeling softwares AERMOD and SCREEN3 – both tools developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and codified into law – for modeling point-source gaseous leakages at the earth's surface. In conclusion we show standardized, optimized mesh designs for known atmospheric conditions, we present a robust decision support tool for decision-makers, and we discuss implementation from both an economic and legal perspective.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that microorganisms are able to mediate removal of U(VI) from solution through reduction to insoluble U(IV) oxides under anaerobic conditions, but microbial transformation of U(VI) under aerobic conditions are less well understood. Here, we describe two processes of U(VI) transformation by the aerobic bacterium Caulobacter crescentus, known for its ubiquitous presence in aquatic systems and high U(VI) tolerance. U(VI) causes a temporary growth arrest in Caulobacter and growth recovery is not due to a decrease in U solubility, a common detoxification strategy employed by other microorganisms. Through functional reporter assays, we discovered that Caulobacter is able to reduce U(VI) bioavailability through a metabolism-dependent increase of medium pH, representing a novel U detoxification strategy. Upon recovery from growth arrest, Caulobacter proliferates with normal growth kinetics, accompanied by active U(VI) biomineralization. We found that phosphate metabolism is actively involved in the formation of U-P precipitates that are similar to autunite-group minerals. Comparisons of growth and U(VI) precipitation by wild type versus a phosphatase mutant indicates that extra-cytoplasmic phosphatase activity is not only responsible for the formation of cell-surface-bound U-P precipitates, but also plays an important role in cell survival under U stress. Our results highlight the importance of aerobic bacterial metabolism for U biogeochemistry.",

            "abstract": "The Lake Tahoe Basin is located on the border of California and Nevada northeast of the Central Valley in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Despite its pristine beauty and water clarity, the Lake Tahoe Basin is facing problems related to air pollution including ambient ozone levels. The meteorology in this region is unusually complex due to mountainous terrain and other topographical features. Thermally driven wind systems are a common phenomenon found in mountainous regions throughout the world. These wind systems, along with the structure of the atmospheric boundary layer are important for understanding the distribution and transport of atmospheric pollutants in complex terrain. Therefore, it is essential in air pollution modeling to correctly represent the planetary boundary layer (PBL) physics that governs the vertical mixing of pollutants and PBL height, where both impact the surface pollutant concentrations. Multiple PBL and Land Surface Model (LSM) parameterization schemes are available in the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model and have different assumptions determining the transport of mass, moisture and energy. During the period of July 21 -26, 2012, a field study was conducted in the Basin designed to characterize the precursors and pathways of secondary pollutant formation, including ozone and secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Using the observations obtained from the field study, this analysis looks at various WRF PBL schemes used in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model and evaluates their performance for this area as well as investigates thermally forced small-scale processes within the Lake Tahoe Basin. The goal of this work is to understand the impact of PBL/LSM schemes on the micrometeorology in complex terrain in order to investigate the impact of transport phenomena on rural ozone concentrations in the Lake Tahoe Basin.",

            "abstract": "Communities and government agencies are increasingly seeking to incorporate climate change information into decision-making to identify effective response actions. The Time of Emergence tool presents a new approach to supporting climate change risk assessment and decision-making by identifying the “time of emergence” (ToE) of the climate change signal for a suite of management-relevant variables. Because natural and human systems tend to be somewhat adapted to historical climate fluctuations, it is when climate change causes local conditions to deviate significantly from the past that ecological and societal disruptions may occur. A key input to deciding and prioritizing actions on climate change, therefore, is information about when and where the distinctive trend due to climate change is projected to emerge from the noise of natural climate variability. Although this information can be gleaned from existing climate change scenarios, it has not been explicitly characterized for variables and spatial scales relevant to local decision-making. Various local climate change projections, based on different emission scenarios, global climate models and downscaling methods, increases the difficulty of identifying when and where the effects of climate change could matter.\nUsing global and statistically-downscaled climate model outputs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) and hydrological model results, management-relevant climatic and environmental variables were analyzed for the US Pacific Northwest (PNW). These variables were selected in consultation with federal, state, and local decision-makers and relate to extreme temperature, precipitation and streamflow events. The web-based interactive system enables user visualization and analysis of ToE for multiple variables across the PNW at varying levels of tolerance for change. The tool also enables users to explore the effects of different sources of uncertainty in the results, e.g., due to greenhouse gas emissions, global climate models, downscaling, statistical estimation of emergence. Identified areas of concern can be combined with information about local sensitivities, design standards or critical thresholds to help identify the relative need and priority for climate change adaptation activities.",

            "abstract": "Several attenuation relationships have been developed to Mexico, mostly after the September 19, 1985 earthquake which has meant a watershed in the development of Mexican seismological engineering. Since 1985, the number of seismic stations has increased significantly especially between the Coast of Guerrero and Mexico City because of the large amplifications that have acurrect on lake zone and hard ground sites in Mexico City. Some studies have analyzed how the seismic waves are attenuated or amplified from the Pacific coast towards the continent. The attenuation relationship used for seismic hazard assessment in Mexico is due to Ordaz (1989) this was obtained from data from the Guerrero acceleration network. Another recent study is that conducted by (Garcia et al., 2005) with recent data from the Guerrero acceleration network considering intraplate earthquakes. It is important to note that all these relations cover to only part of the Mexican subduction zone, and for some types of seismic sources it may be not suitable to study the earthquake risk in other regions of Mexico.\nFor this work we consider the state of Michoacán, because it has one of the most important seismogenic zones in Mexico. Within the state there are three different kinds of seismic sources: and volcanic tectonic earthquakes and those caused by local faults in the region. Then it is a vital issue to study the seismic wave propagation within the state. We installed a temporary network with 9 accelerographic stations, located at Faro de Brucerías, Aguililla, Apatzingán, Taretán, Uruapan, Nueva Italia Pátzcuaro, Morelia and Maravatío, Michoacán. The stations formed a perpendicular line to the coast, with a total length of 366 km, the distance between stations varies from 60 to 80 km.\nAmong the total seismic events recorded, we selected 7 seismic events located in the Michoacán coastline, from 4.1 to 5.1 Mw. With those records, Q quality factor (107.215 f 0.74) was calculated for frequencies between 0.1 and 10 Hz, since those are the important frequencies for Earthquake Engineering. The preliminary results show a significantly larger attenuation compared with the attenuation laws for the states of Guerrero and Colima.",

At the Non-vertebrate Paleontology Lab, a large mixed paleo and geological repository on a restricted budget, we opted for one such database, Specify.

We currently use the server version of Specify 6, networked to all computers in the lab each running a desktop client, often with six users at any one time. Along with improved access there have been great efforts to broaden the applicability of this database to other disciplines. Current developments are of great importance to us because they focus on the geological aspects of lithostratigraphy and chronostratigaphy and their relationship to other variables. Adoption of this software has required constant change as we move to take advantage of the great improvements. We enjoy the interaction with the developers and their willingness to listen and consider our issues. Here we discuss some of the ways in which we have fashioned Specify into a database that provides us with the flexibility that we need without removing the ability to share our data with other aggregators through accepted protocols. We discuss the customization of forms, the attachment of media and tracking of original media files, our efforts to incorporate geological specimens, and our plans to link the individual specimen record GUIDs to an IGSN numbers and thence to future connections to data derived from our specimens.",

            "abstract": "Spatial correlations of cloud droplets cause particulate Bragg scattering, which increases the reflected microwave intensity in radar observations. Most studies assume that particulate Bragg scattering is insignificant in clouds. However, cloud turbulence generates microscale clusters of cloud droplets due to centrifugal effects. This indicates that the influence of turbulent clustering can be a cause of observational errors. Thus, this study aims to investigate the influence of turbulent clustering of cloud droplets on the radar reflectivity factor. Droplet clustering data are obtained by performing a three-dimensional direct numerical simulation (DNS), in which an isotropic turbulence is generated by solving the Navier-Stokes equation without any turbulence model and a large number of droplet motions are tracked by the Lagrangian method. The clustering data are used to calculate the power spectrum of number density fluctuation. The results show that the turbulent Reynolds number dependency of the power spectrum is sufficiently small for enough high turbulent Reynolds number. On the other hand, the spectrum is strongly dependent on the Stokes number, which is defined as the ratio of droplet relaxation time to the Kolmogorov time. Thus, the influence of turbulent clustering on the radar reflectivity factor is estimated by using the power spectrum considering the Stokes number dependency. We will show the estimate results under ideal cumulus cloud conditions, where the droplet size distributions and the number densities are set based on the dataset of Hess et al. (1998), and discuss the influence on radar cloud observations.",

Taney Seamount-A, the largest and oldest in the chain, is defined by four well-exposed calderas which reveal previously infilled lavas. The calderas can be differentiated in time by their cross-cutting relationships, creating a relative chronology. The caldera walls and intracaldera pillow mounds were sampled systematically by a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to obtain stratigraphically-controlled samples, a unique aspect of this study.\nLava geochemistry varies from more differentiated to more primitive with time (6.2 - 8.6 wt.% MgO), suggesting that the sub-caldera reservoir is open and undergoes periodic collapse, replenishment, shallow crystallization, and eruption. The primitive replenishing magmas entrain a crystal cargo of high-anorthite plagioclase (An80-90) with melt inclusion volatile saturation pressures (CO2 - H2O) indicating entrapment at the lower crust or upper mantle (8-12 km b.s.f). Melt inclusions exhibit positive Sr and Eu anomalies (e.g., SrPM / [CePMNdPM]1/2 ), negative Zr and Nb anomalies, and [Ba/Nb]PM >1 when normalized to primitive mantle. In comparison, the host lavas exhibit positive Sr anomalies but no concurrent Eu, Zr, and Nb anomalies and [Ba/Nb]PM <1. We propose that episodic partial melting and recrystallization of lower-crustal cumulates at the Moho result in melt inclusions with a plagioclase cumulate signal. Later percolating melts undergo diffusion with and entrain recrystallized plagioclase cumulates resulting in the positive Sr signal (but no Eu, Zr, Nb anomalies, and [Ba/Nb]PM <1). Geochemistry of the host lava and melt inclusions and crystal textures imply that melt-rock interaction is an important process in oceanic magmatic systems.",

            "abstract": "The strategically biggest mineral deposits are located in South Gobi Region, Mongolia and the Mongolian government has been adhering the policy to operate them in near short terms. Groundwater is one of the important resources since rainfall and surface water availability are limited. This survey was made for the purpose to determination to principle of originating groundwater potentials. For the purpose, groundwater age was investigated with the stable isotope, radiocarbon and tritium method. They were analyzed in the laboratory of CIO of Rijksuniversiteit Groningen (The Centre of Isotope Research), Institute of Groundwater Ecology from the Helmholtz Zentrum and the German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH) in Munich, Germany.\nDeep groundwater has radiocarbon ages from 13,000 to 45,000 years before present (0.4-18.4% modern C) and δ13C values from -10.0 to -4.6‰, for which it is difficult to assign absolute ages, although these values probably represent the Late Glacial period and late Pleistocene age. Shallow groundwater had tritium values of <1 to 20.8 TU, from which only 2 locations can be referred as recently infiltrated (since 1953) – or recent mixed with fossil groundwater. Groundwater aquifers were mainly found in Cretaceous sediments that have filled-up large basins in the Gobi and there is a good possibility that aquifers are interconnected via these basin sediments, although sedimentary facies changes and geological faults may form barriers to groundwater flow.",

            "abstract": "The State of Vermont is experiencing changing hydrological regimes due to increased precipitation resulting from climate change. Understanding the impacts this change may cause to river corridors and the water quality of receiving waters is a critical need. Estimating the loading of sediment and sediment-bound nutrients such as phosphorous from various sources is a key aspect. In particular, the proportion attributable to main stem bank erosion is of concern as it is suspected to be a significant source in river basins in the Northeast. Sediment and nutrient budgets have been utilized for many years to provide a conceptual framework for proportioning loading to different sources. In this study, a continuous turbidity monitoring station network informs the creation of a watershed sediment budget in a small watershed.\nMonitoring stations placed on select upstream tributaries as well as the downstream watershed outlet are used to characterize overall watershed yield as well as loading to the main stem from tributaries. Analysis of differential unit area loading from tributary and downstream monitoring sites estimate the proportion of the overall watershed sediment yield that could be attributed to main stem bank erosion. Regression models of suspended sediment and total phosphorous enable the quantification of sediment-bound phosphorous loadings from stream banks. To characterize loadings and overall watershed sediment and nutrient yields, a probabilistic framework is created using a Bayesian approach that enables updating of continuously-collected data and provides estimates of uncertainty resulting in credible ranges of sediment and phosphorous loading. These sediment and nutrient budget estimates along with their associated uncertainties help inform water resource managers of loading sources and enable prioritization of mitigation efforts.",

            "abstract": "The geographical location of Tafilalet oasis system (TOS) in the south of the valley of Ziz (Morocco) offers him a particular advantage on the plane of water potential. The surface water which comes from humid regions of the High Atlas and intercepted by a dam then converged through the watercourse of Ziz towards the plain of the TOS, have created the conditions for the formation of a water table relatively rich with regard to the local climatic conditions (arid climate with recurrent drought). Given the role of the water table in the economic development of the region, a hydrogeological study was conducted to understand the impact of artificial recharge and recurrent droughts on the development of the groundwater reserves of TOS. In this study, a three-dimensional model of groundwater flow was developed for the TOS, to assist the decision makers as a \"management tool\" in order to assess alternative schemes for development and exploitation of groundwater resources based on the variation of artificial recharge and drought.\nThe results from this numerical investigation of the TOS aquifer shows that the commissioning of the dam to control the flows of extreme flood and good management of water releases, has avoided the losses of irrigation water and consequently the non-overexploitation of the groundwater. So that with one or two water releases per year from the dam of flow rate more than 28 million m3/year it is possible to reconstruct the volume of water abstracted by wells. The idea of lowering water table by pumping wells is not exactly true, as well the development of groundwater abstraction has not prevented the wound of water table in these last years, the pumping wells accompanied more than it triggers the lowering of water table and it is mainly the succession of dry periods causing the decreases of the piezometric level. This situation confirms the important role that groundwater plays as a “buffer” during the drought periods.",

            "abstract": "The Dynamic Ionosphere CubeSat Experiment (DICE) consists of two identical 1.5U CubeSats deployed simultaneously from a single P-POD (Poly Picosatellite Orbital Deployer) into the same orbit. Several observational campaigns were planned between the DICE CubeSats and the mid-latitude Millstone Hill Incoherent Scatter Radar (ISR) in order to calibrate the DICE measurements of electron density and electron temperature.\nIn this presentation, we compare in-situ observations from the Dynamic Ionosphere CubeSat Experiment (DICE) and from the Millstone Hill ISR. Both measurements are cross-calibrated against an assimilative model of the global ionospheric electron density. The electron density and electron temperature were obtained for three Millstone Hill DICE overflights (2013-03-12, 2013-03-15, 2013-03-17). We compare the data during quiet and geomagnetically disturbed conditions and find evidence of an storm enhanced density (SED) plume in the topside ionosphere on 2013-03-17 at 19? UTC. During this disturbed interval, American longitude sector high density plasma was convected near 15 SLT towards the noontime cusp.\nDICE was selected for flight under the NSF \"CubeSat-based Science Mission for Space Weather and Atmospheric Research\" program. The DICE twin satellites were launched on a Delta II rocket on October 28, 2011. The satellites are flying in a “leader-follower” formation in an elliptical orbit which ranges from 820 to 400 km in altitude. Each satellite carries a fixed-bias DC Langmuir Probe (DCP) to measure in-situ ionospheric plasma densities and a science grade magnetometer to measure DC and AC geomagnetic fields. The purpose of these measurements was to permit accurate identification of storm-time features such as the SED bulge and plume. The mission team combines expertise from ASTRA, Utah State University/Space Dynamics Laboratory (USU/SDL), and Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. In this paper we present a comparison of data from DICE and Millstone Hill ISR during quiet and magnetically disturbed conditions.",

            "abstract": "Deep cumulus convection can influence the height of the tropopause either through plumes which penetration into the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) or by forcing broad-scale vertical motion. This study uses the unique capabilities of satellite-based cross-track sounders to provide three-dimensional images of temperature in the TTL. These are used to derive thermal tropopause height and to study the scale-dependence of tropopause height variability and its relation to distance and intensity of deep convection.\nThe data used in this study are 10 years of tropical Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) swath (level 2) temperature profile data. Localized spatial power spectra are derived from swaths of tropopause height, which are ordered relative to the timing of deep convective clouds. The relative contributions of small-scale and large-scale power are use to characterize the influence of the scale of the vertical motion in the TTL. The highest spatial scales sampled by the AIRS temperature field are mesoscale systems of deep cumulus convection approximately 200 to 400 km across because the horizontal spatial resolution of the AIRS temperature profile product is approximately 50 km. AIRS temperature profiles have state-dependent errors correlated with cloud amount, but are more useful than temperature profiles from microwave sounders because of their higher vertical resolution. TTL temperature has less sampling error then mid and lower troposphere temperature, and the time binning is used to characterize and reduce these errors.\nThe intensity of cumulus convection is inferred from the derived cloud properties, specifically cloud-top height, cloud-ice effective diameter and their power. The height difference between tropopause and cloud-top is used to characterize the likelihood that vertical motions extend to the tropopause, while the cloud-ice effective diameter provides a measure of the intensity of the convective vertical velocity and its ability to lift larger ice particles. This study investigates the seasonal and temporal variability of the tropopause height power spectra, the contributions of measurement error and the relation between tropopause height and cloud properties.",

            "abstract": "Accurate regional scale estimates of snow water equivalent (SWE) are essential to skillful snow state initializations in hydrological models and improving streamflow predictions. This is especially true for the nival rivers of British Columbia, Canada. Several state-of-the-art gridded products are evaluated against in situ manual snow concourse surveys for their ability to estimate SWE over the province. These products span the range of reanalyses (ERA-Interim and MERRA), land data assimilation systems (GLDAS-1 and -2), observational products (CMC Snow Analysis), microwave emission products (NSIDC SWE Climatology), and hybrid observational products (GlobSnow). Interannual time series for the manual snow surveys and each gridded SWE product are constructed for each survey period and evaluated for amplitude and phase agreement. Comparisons of these timeseries demonstrate that the products in this study generally significantly underestimate SWE, with the most negative relative biases reported near the end of the snow season. Correlations suggest that relative interannual variations are best captured by most products earlier in the snow season, but significant geographic trends are not apparent. Skill scores also decline through the first few months of the season but show improvement as melt-off occurs in May and June. Peak SWE, which typically occurs on or near the beginning of April survey, is one of the most challenging times for accurate estimation, possibly associated with difficulties in estimating SWE for extremely large snowpacks.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies demonstrated that deep Marcellus shale brines migrate into shallow groundwater aquifers, presumably via fractures in the subsurface that exist independent of any gas extraction activities. However, whereas many inorganic species are conservative tracers, hydrophobic organic compounds are both sorptive and reactive, and geogenic organic chemicals may not survive transport from deep shales to the subsurface. Here, 40 shallow groundwater samples from private wells in Northeastern Pennsylvania were analyzed for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and gasoline range organic compounds (GRO), and 17 were analyzed for VOCs, GRO, and diesel range organic compounds (DRO). BTEX compounds (i.e., benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes) were detected in 6 of 40 samples at concentrations orders of magnitude below EPA maximum contaminant levels (e.g., << 5 ppb) and did not spatially correlate with distance to the nearest active hydraulic fracturing well. GRO was detected in 10 of 40 samples at concentrations as high as 8.8 ± 0.4 ppb and did not correlate with distance to the nearest hydraulic fracturing well (p = 0.24) nor in active fracturing zones, which we defined as sample locations less than 1 km from a well (p = 0.60). However, GRO was strongly correlated (p = 0.004) with shallow groundwater with Marcellus Shale inorganic chemical character, as delineated by inorganic chemical analysis. DRO was detected in all 17 samples up to 158 ± 4 ppb and did not spatially correlate with distance to the nearest hydraulic fracturing well (p = 0.74), nor active zones (p = 0.61). Similar to GRO, DRO did correlate with shallow groundwater containing Marcellus Shale character with moderate significance (p = 0.08). These results indicate that: (a) hydrophobic organic chemicals can survive transport from the deep subsurface to shallow groundwaters, and (b) transport of these compounds is not detectably enhanced by hydraulic fracturing activities in Northeastern PA as of the 2012-2014 summers.",

The County completed their goal of characterizing seismic susceptibility of the top 100 ft and the results are posted at\nhttp://gisgate.co.clark.nv.us/openweb/. The research question of the authors is: What additional geologic information can be inferred from the data, either through reprocessing, cross correlation of drill hole data or additional data collection?\nAn advantage of geophysical data is that it can be reprocessed to provide additional insight into the local geologic setting. The interpretation is also improved if combined with drill hole data and / or hydrologic information. It should be noted that there is also legacy geophysical data in limited areas collected by the USGS, primarily in conjunction with water well drilling, where some of the ReMi seismic data was collected.\nAn unexpected result of the ReMi survey was a clear delineation of current and paleo channels in Laughlin, Moapa, and Las Vegas. The geometry of the paleochanel, of the Colorado River, is well away from the current position. however the signal is very similar to modern streams such as the Muddy River.\nAlthough the surficial geologic mapping in Las Vegas Valley was very detailed, and importantly, was performed prior to development; the new geophysical data provides better details of the lithologic properties of the units.

            "abstract": "Each El Nino event is unique. The still developing event of 2014 is not an exception – its evolution has already surprised many researchers who in May anticipated a likely development of a strong warm event perhaps analogous to that in 1997/1998; however, by June - July its development nearly stalled. Whether one should still expect a strong warm event is now much less certain. It is believed that the activity of westerly wind bursts (WWBs) that occur in the tropical Pacific and the varying response of the coupled system to those bursts are among the key reasons for such uncertainty and, in general, of the broad diversity of El Niño events. For instance, WWBs that occurred at the beginning of 1997 and 2014 were favorable for the potential El Nino development. However, in the latter case the subsequent ocean-atmosphere interactions, which involve the interplay between the warm pool changes in the western/central Pacific and the warming of the eastern equatorial Pacific, might have impeded further development. In this study, we consider the evolution of different El Niño events after strong westerly wind bursts in a comprehensive coupled climate model and in the observations, aiming to find analogues to the event of 2014 and several other significant events and determine critical elements, and precursors, that affected their evolution, thus contributing to El Nino diversity.",

            "abstract": "We present results from direct numerical simulations of the Boussinesq equations in the presence of rotation and/or stratification, both in the vertical direction. The runs are forced isotropically and randomly at small scales and have spatial resolutions of up to 10243 grid points and Reynolds numbers of ≈ 1000. We first show that solutions with negative energy flux and inverse cascades develop in rotating turbulence, whether or not stratification is present. However, the purely stratified case is characterized instead by an early-time, highly anisotropic transfer to large scales with almost zero net isotropic energy flux. This is consistent with previous studies that observed the development of vertically sheared horizontal winds, although only at substantially later times. However, and unlike previous works, when sufficient scale separation is allowed between the forcing scale and the domain size, the total energy displays a perpendicular (horizontal) spectrum with power law behavior compatible with ∼ k⊥ -5/3, including in the absence of rotation. In this latter purely stratified case, such a spectrum is the result of a direct cascade of the energy contained in the large-scale horizontal wind, as is evidenced by a strong positive flux of energy in the parallel direction at all scales including the largest resolved scales.",

            "abstract": "We present an overview of a mission concept named Situational Awareness Sensor Suite for the ISS (SASSI) with a special focus here on low-latitude ionospheric plasma turbulence measurements relevant to equatorial spread-F. SASSI is a suite of sensors that improves Space Situational Awareness for the ISS local space environment, as well as unique ionospheric measurements and support active plasma experiments on the ISS. As such, the mission concept has both operational and basic research objectives.\nWe will describe two compelling measurement techniques enabled by SASSI's unique mission architecture. That is, SASSI provides new abilities to 1) measure space plasma potentials in low Earth orbit over ~100 m relative to a common potential, and 2) to investigate multi-scale ionospheric plasma turbulence morphology simultaneously of both ~ 1 cm and ~ 10 m scale lengths. The first measurement technique will aid in the distinction of vertical drifts within equatorial plasma bubbles from the vertical motions of the bulk of the layer due to zonal electric fields. The second will aid in understanding ionospheric plasma turbulence cascading in scale sizes that affect over the horizon radar.\nDuring many years of ISS operation, we have conducted effective (but not perfect) human and robotic extravehicular activities within the space plasma environment surrounding the ISS structure. However, because of the complexity of the interaction between the ISS and the space environment, there remain important sources of unpredictable environmental situations that affect operations. Examples of affected systems include EVA safety, solar panel efficiency, and scientific instrument integrity. Models and heuristically-derived best practices are well-suited for routine operations, but when it comes to unusual or anomalous events or situations, there is no substitute for real-time monitoring.\nSASSI is being designed to deploy and operate a suite of low-cost, medium/high-TRL plasma sensors on the ISS Express Logistics Carrier for long-term observations and the Space Station Remote Manipulator System for short-term focused campaigns. The presentation will include a description of the instrument complement and an overview of the operations concept.",

The first version of ODM focused on timeseries, and ultimately led the development of OGC “WaterML2 Part 1: Timeseries”, which is being proposed to be developed into OGC TimeseriesML.Our team has developed an ODMv2 model to address ODMv1 shortcomings, and to encompass a wider community of spatially discrete, feature-based earth observations. The development process included collecting requirements from several existing Earth Observations data systems: HIS,\nCZOData, IEDA and EarthChem system, and IOOS. We developed ODM2 as a set of core entities with additional extensioncomponents that can be utilized. These extensions include for shared functionality (e.g. data quality, provenance), as well as specific use cases (e.g. laboratory analysis, equipment).\nInitially, we closely followed the Observations and Measures (ISO19156) concept model. After prototyping and reviewing the requirements, we extended the ODMv2 conceptual model to include entities to document ancillary acts that do not always produce a result. Differing from O&M where acts are expected to produce a result. ODMv2 includes the core concept of an “Action” which encapsulates activities or actions associated that are performed in the process of making an observation, but may not produce a result. Actions, such as a sample analysis, that observe a property and produce a result are equivalent to O&M observation. But in many use cases, many actions have no resulting observation. Examples of such actions are a site visit or sample preparation (splitting of a sample). These actions are part of a chain of actions, iwhich produce the final observation.\nOverall the ODMv2 generally follows the O&M conceptual model. The nearly final ODMv2 includes a core and extensions. The core entities include actions, feature actions (observations), datasets (groupings), methods (procedures), sampling features and variables (observed properties). Results entities are separated to handle the diversity of possibilities: time series, categorical, and 6 others. Extensions handle requirements for equipment, laboratory analyses, provenance, data quality, and controlled vocabularies.",

The results show that OCs Only account for 2.6% of total cold cloud systems (cloud top IR brightness temperature less than 235 K) over Asian, and are mainly distributed to the south of 15°N, and nearly 50% of OCs occur in summer. The number of OCs over the ocean is higher than that over the land almost in every month, and the volumetric precipitation rate and area of OCs over the ocean are also higher than that over the land. It can be seen that OCs is obviously stronger than Non-Overshooting Convections (NOCs), and the OCs over the land are stronger than that over the ocean from lightning frequency, microwave brightness temperature and radar echo top. Strong OCs are mainly concentrated in the south slope of the Himalayas, eastern China and Southeast Asia, where the probability of OCs occurrence is also higher. It can be found that there are similar patterns of spatial distribution between OCs and thermodynamic and humidity parameters. The CAPE and specific humidity in the tropics are higher than that in the subtropics, which provides a favorable environmental condition for OCs occurrence. In summer, the same scenario also can be seen in the south slope of the Himalayas and the eastern-central China.",

            "abstract": "The Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) program supported by the National Science Foundation originated from the recommendation of the Earth Science community published in the National Research Council report “Basic Research Opportunities in Earth Sciences” (2001) to establish natural laboratories to study processes and systems of the Critical Zone – the surface and near-surface environment sustaining nearly all terrestrial life. After a number of critical zone community workshops to develop a science plan, the CZO program was initiated in 2007 with three sites and has now grown to 10 sites and a National Office, which coordinates research, education and outreach activities of the network. Several of the CZO sites are collocated with sites supported by the US Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) and the Long Term Agricultural Research (LTAR) programs, and the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). Future collaboration with additional sites of these networks will add to the potential to answer questions in a more comprehensive manner and in a larger regional scale about the critical zone form and function. At the international level, CZOs have been established in many countries and strong collaborations with the US program have been in place for many years. The next step is the development of a coordinated international program of critical zone research. The success of the CZO network of sites can be measured in transformative results that elucidate properties and processes controlling the critical zone and how the critical zone structure, stores and fluxes respond to climate and land use change. This understanding of the critical zone can be used to enhance resilience and sustainability, and restore ecosystem function. Thus, CZO science can address major societal challenges.\nThe US CZO network is a facility open to research of the critical zone community at large. Scientific data and information about the US program are available at www.criticalzone.org.",

As demands on water resources increase the need for sustainable and healthy waterways becomes even more essential. This research investigates how an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can be utilized for data collection necessary in stream restoration design and evaluation. UAV’s offer an inexpensive method to collect information on channel geometry and map grain size distributions of the bed material. This data is critical in hydraulic flow modeling and engineering plans needed to create a restoration design, as well as evaluate if an implemented project has met its goals. This research utilized a UAV and structure-from-motion photogrammetry to monitor a recent stream restoration project designed to reduce erosion on a 1.9 km reach of Teton Creek in Eastern Idaho. A digital elevation model of difference was created from an as-built field survey and a UAV derived terrain model to identify areas of erosion and deposition in the restoration reach. The data has shown relatively small areas of channel instability in the restoration reach, and has also identified sections which may require additional restoration activities in Teton Creek. The grain size distribution of Teton Creek was also mapped utilizing a UAV and digital photosieving techniques, for use in sediment transport equations in the restoration reach. Data collected quickly and inexpensively from a UAV is valuable to river managers to monitor restoration work. This research identifies the methods and materials needed for river managers to conduct UAV surveys of streams for use in restoration design and monitoring.",

It is also true that at these distances tidal dissipation raised by the star on the planet becomes critical. Thus, it is important to investigate what are the interior and surface conditions of these tidally heated planets. For low-mass planets, outgassing, which is tied to mantle convection, sets the dominant input component to the atmospheric composition (with atmospheric escape and ingassing the other relevant components), which in turn helps determine the surface temperature and overall habitability profile. We have performed interior dynamic calculations based on [1] tied to a simple outgassing model to investigate the effects of tidal heating in outgassing. I will present results of the effect of planetary mass and tidal heating in outgassing budgets, by taking Earth as the reference state.\n[1] Tackley, P. J., M. Ammann, J. P. Brodholt, D. P.

            "abstract": "As a natural disturbance in the earth system, fire plays a critical role in determining vegetation composition and distribution, atmospheric components, terrestrial carbon budget, and land surface energy balance, which all contribute to climate change. However, the fire regime prior to satellite era (the 1980s) is largely unknown at global level due to the lack of sufficient long-term fire records. Recently, a centurial-scale burned area dataset has been reconstructed at global level based on satellite information and fire model simulation. By incorporating this fire dataset into the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM), we estimated the fire emissions from global fires and analyzed the changes in terrestrial ecosystem carbon budget caused by fire during 1901 – 2010.\nOur preliminary results indicated that the average global fire emissions is 3.0 Pg C year-1 with a significantly decreasing trend during the study period. The difference between fire-on and fire-off simulations showed that fires reduced both net primary productivity (NPP) and ecosystem heterotrophic respiration (Rh). The immediate post-fire reduction in NPP is stronger than that in Rh, which dampened the Net Ecosystem Productivity; while the long-term post-fire recovery in NPP is much faster than that in Rh. Overall, the post-fire recovery processes sequestrated approximately 50% of the carbon emissions released from fires; the global fire cause a net carbon source at about 1.5 Pg C year-1 during the 110 years.\nIn the 21st century, a large increase in global fire potential and burned area has been reported by previous studies according to climate projections. Our results imply that the future fires regime could produce more GHG emissions and reduce carbon sink size, which in turn cause positive feedbacks to global warming.",

            "abstract": "The Ediacaran Period closed out the environmentally raucous Neoproterozoic Era with the last of multiple glacial events and the first ephemeral glimmer of multicellular life. As such, evolution of Earth’s biosphere and the marine environments that nurtured this nascent biota are of particular interest. Because the Ediacaran biota appear in the stratigraphic record just above tillites in many localities, inferences are naturally drawn to link glaciation to bioevolution. Here we review known controls on the timing and extent of the late Ediacaran Gaskier and Varanger glacial events, bolstered by new constraints on the Moelv tillite of South Norway.\nThe elusive mid-Ediacaran glacial strata are poorly dated, patchy in distribution, and relatively limited in thickness. The type Gaskier glaciogenic units in Newfoundland are 582 to 584 Ma, based on U-Pb zircon ages from intercalated ash beds [1]. The Varanger glaciogenic deposits in northern Norway, in contrast, remain only roughly constrained to ca. 630 to 560 Ma.\nPost-Gaskier negative carbon isotope excursions (CIEs) have been reported from multiple localities in both China and SW United States, suggesting climatic instability in the late Ediacaran. Although most localities lack solid geochronology, paleontologic constraints place the Hongtiegou glacial diamictite and accompanying CIE in the Chaidam Basin, NW China, in the latest Ediacaran, ca. 555 Ma [2]. We previously suggested that the Moelv tillite in south Norway was roughly equivalent to the Gaskier, based on an imprecise Re-Os age of ~560 Ma [3] for the underlying Biri shale. Reanalysis of these data shows that the upper part of the shale section was disturbed by a redox front during the Caledonian orogeny. The undisturbed lower part of the section yields a more precise Model 1 isochron age of 559.5 ± 6.2 Ma, clearly post-dating the Gaskier event well outside analytical uncertainty.\nThese new results bolster arguments that the Gaskier glaciation was not a global “snowball Earth” event; rather, there may have been multiple Ediacaran glacial advances – perhaps only at high latitudes – marked by tillites of regional, but not global extent.\n[1] Bowring et al. 2002, Astrobiology 2: 457-458.

            "abstract": "Commercial and industrial information systems have long built and relied upon standard data formats and transactions. Business processes, analytics, applications, and social networks emerge on top of these standards to create value. Examples of value delivered include operational productivity, analytics that enable growth and profit, and enhanced human communication and creativity for innovation.\nIn science informatics, some research and operational activities operate with only scattered adoption of standards and few of the emergent benefits of interoperability. In-situ biological data management in the marine domain is an exemplar. From the origination of biological occurrence records in surveys, observer programs, monitoring and experimentation, through distribution techniques, to applications, decisions, and management response, marine biological data can be difficult, limited, and costly to integrate because of non-standard and undocumented conditions in the data.\nWhile this presentation identifies deficits in marine biological data practices, the presentation also identifies this as a field of opportunity. Standards for biological data and metadata do exist, with growing global adoption and extensibility features. Scientific, economic, and social-value motivations provide incentives to maximize marine science investments. Diverse science communities of national and international scale begin to see benefits of collaborative technologies.\nOBIS-USA (http://USGS.gov/obis-usa) is a program of the United States Geological Survey.

            "abstract": "Continental shelf circulation north of Cape Hatteras is complex, with southward flowing Middle Atlantic Bight shelf water intersecting the Gulf Stream and subducting offshore into the Gulf Stream. In May, 2012, a cruise was conducted in order to study the shelf circulation and acoustic propagation through fish schools in the area. An important aspect of the study was to use Autonomous Underwater Vehicles to map fish schools with a sidescan sonar. High-resolution hydrographic surveys to map the continental shelf water masses and shelfbreak frontal structure were sampled to relate oceanographic conditions to the fish school distributions.\nThe cold pool water mass over the continental shelf in May 2012 was extremely warm, with temperature anomalies of up to 5 Degrees C relative to observations from the same area in May, 1996. The normal cross-shelf temperature gradients within the shelfbreak front were not present because of the warming. As a result, the shelf density field was much more buoyant than usual, which led to an accelerated shelfbreak jet. Moored velocity measurements at the 60 m isobath recorded alongshelf flow of as much as 0.6 m/s.\nThe anticipated fish species were not observed over the continental shelf. Some comments on the forcing leading to the large scale warming will be presented, along with a brief discussion of the impact of the warming on the marine ecosystem in the northeast U.S.",

            "abstract": "Our previous study showed that the annual oceanic Rossby wave contributes to the westward advection of cold water in the southeastern Indian Ocean, resulting in abrupt cooling and lagged convective onset of the Madden-Julian Oscillation in the central south Indian Ocean during the cooperative Indian Ocean experiment on intraseasonal variability in the Year 2011 (CINDY2011). In this study, the relationship between seasonal cooling associated with the Rossby wave and the Madden-Julian Oscillation in boreal winter (October to March) is examined for the period of 1993-2012. The westward propagation of positive sea level anomalies (as a proxy of the Rossby wave) is found in most of years but its amplitude and date of arrival in central south Indian Ocean vary from year to year. Warm SST anomalies migrate concurrently with the downwelling Rossby wave but are followed by a wide-spread cold pool in the southeastern Indian Ocean. During El Niño and/or positive Indian Ocean Dipole years, the Rossby waves tend to have larger amplitudes and the cold pool spread more widely than the other years. The first MJO events of the year which propagate from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific are found around and after the cold pool termination. Thus, the southeastern Indian Ocean cold pool may prevent intraseasonal convection in the Indian Ocean from propagating eastward to the Pacific.",

            "abstract": "Raised peat bogs receive all precipitation and nutrients from the atmosphere and are thus widely used archives for information on past environments and climates. In this paper we provide high-resolution multi-proxy data from a raised bog from northeastern Prince Edward Island, located in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada. We studied testate amoeba (a proxy for water table depth), macrocharcoal (a proxy for local-scale fire), peat humification (a proxy for decomposition), plant macrofossils (indicative of local-scale vegetation), and organic matter content (yielding carbon accumulation rates) from a 5.5 m long core lifted from the center of Baltic Bog. Eleven AMS radiocarbon dates show that peat accumulation began before 9000 cal yr BP and continued almost uninterrupted until the present. The macrofossil data show that a transition from a sedge-dominated fen to a sphagnum-dominated bog occurred around 8000 cal yr BP, and sphagnum remained dominant in the bog throughout most of the Holocene. A testate amoeba-based reconstruction of water table depth indicates that conditions were drier during the early Holocene (~8000 to 5000 cal yr BP) and became gradually wetter into the late Holocene. In addition, a number of higher frequency shifts in precipitation are inferred throughout the Holocene on the basis of the testate amoeba and humification results. The macrocharcoal evidence indicates fire—probably in the surrounding forest—was relatively more common during the early Holocene, perhaps due to drier climate conditions. A large influx of charcoal at around 2000 cal yr BP suggests the presence of one or more major fires at this time, and a concurrent decrease in the rate of peat accumulation indicates the fire may have affected the bog itself. The data from Baltic Bog is broadly comparable to other proxy data (in particular pollen studies) from the Canadian Maritimes. This work is important because it: 1) helps us better understand the role of hydroclimatic variability in influencing peat bog ecosystems; and 2), represents one of the few peat-based records of Holocene paleoclimate from the region.",

            "abstract": "The accumulation of voluminous crystal-poor rhyolites from an upper crustal mush environment inherently necessitates the complementary formation of unerupted silicic cumulates. However, identification of such frozen cumulates remains controversial. This has motivated us to develop of a new geochemical model aimed at better constraining the behavior of trace elements in a magma reservoir concurrently tracking crystallization and imperfect segregation of melt. We use a numerical method to solve our model equations rather than seek analytical solutions, thereby relieving overly simplistic assumptions for the dependencies between partition coefficient or melt segregation rate as functions of crystallinity. Our model allows partition coefficient to vary depending on the crystallinizing mineralogy at any particular stage in magma cooling, as well as the ability to test different rates and efficiencies of crystal-melt segregation. We apply our model first to the Searchlight Pluton as a well-constrained case study, which allows us to quantitatively test existing interpretations of that pluton. Building on this, we broaden our model to better understand the relationship between volcanic and plutonic rocks utilizing the NAVDAT database. Our results produce unambiguous fractionation signatures for segregated melts, while those signatures are muted for their cumulate counterparts. These models suggest that some large granitiods may represent accumulations of crystals, having lost melt in some cases to volcanic eruptions or to higher level evolved plutonic units, although the trace element signature of this process is expected to be subtle.",

            "abstract": "Because barrier islands are low-lying and dynamic landforms, their habitats are especially sensitive to changing environmental conditions. The continued existence of barrier island landforms will depend on the degree to which islands can maintain elevation above sea level while also responding to changes in forcing by migrating landward. We are increasingly learning that ecomorphodynamic interactions (i.e., interactions between ecological and morphodynamic processes) as well as couplings between island and back-barrier marsh environments play a critical role in determining how barrier island systems will evolve as sea level rises, storm intensity increases and the species composition of coastal vegetation changes in the future. Here, we present an overview and synthesis of recent and new model experiments and observations that illustrate the importance of feedbacks between vegetative and sediment transport processes as well as the importance of ecomorphodynamic couplings between landscape units in influencing 1) the rate of formation, maximum height and morphology of coastal dunes; 2) overall island state (high vs. low) and the potential for rapid transitions in state to occur in response to gradually changing forcing; and 3) the persistence of back-barrier marshes, and thus the influence of back-barrier marshes on the rate of migration of barrier island-marsh systems.",

            "abstract": "The U.S. Cordillera in Idaho and Oregon is the location of an unusually steep tectonic boundary between relatively juvenile accreted island-arc terranes and Precambrian North American craton. Accretion occurred in the Mesozoic, forming the Salmon River suture zone. Following accretion, transpressional deformation in the Cretaceous shortened and steepened the suture zone along the western Idaho shear zone (WISZ) into a narrow boundary less than 10km wide at the surface. The region was later modified by emplacement of the Idaho batholith, Challis volcanism, the Columbia River Basalts, and Basin and Range-style extension. The EarthScope IDOR project acquired a controlled-source seismic survey across this region with a 430-km refraction and wide-angle reflection line. It utilized 2555 vertical component seismometer stations to record 8 explosive shots, as well as many hours of continuous recording for background seismicity and ambient noise. Travel-time tomography and reflection modeling have been used to produce a preliminary seismic velocity model of the whole crust.\nThere are significant differences between the seismic velocity, mid-crustal boundaries, and crustal thickness seen in the accreted terranes west of the WISZ and those seen in the Idaho batholith and Precambrian craton to the east. The crust west of the WISZ is characterized by faster velocities consistent with mafic oceanic-arc crust, while the crust east of the WISZ has a slower velocity consistent with primarily felsic, continental-affinity crust. Numerous wide-angle seismic reflections are observed on both sides of the WISZ. To the west, there is a lower-crustal reflector that produces a stronger reflection amplitude than the Moho. Beneath the Idaho batholith and Challis volcanics to the east, several smaller-amplitude wide-angle reflections indicate complexity in mid-crustal structure. Thickness of the crust east of the WISZ is 6-12 km greater than the crust to the west, and Moho reflections near the WISZ are very weak. The contrasts across the WISZ are consistent with a lithospheric-scale, near-vertical shear zone juxtaposing cratonic and oceanic lithosphere. This reflection and travel-time tomography model will produce a detailed crustal-scale characterization of this tectonically modified edge of the North American craton.",

The geophysical data are tied to trenches to establish a lithostratigraphic interpretation. Archie’s Law, calibrated to resistivity measurements on soil samples from each site, is used to estimate in-situ soil pore saturation. Three different stream types are surveyed. Increasing in stream order, these are incised bedrock with alluvium fill, incised alluvium, and braided streams. Three radar facies are identified on the basis of reflection amplitude, continuity, and dip. Near the surface, RF1 (0.5-1.5 m thick) contains laterally continuous sheetlike deposits interpreted to be active channel gravel, sand, and cobble deposits reworked during floods. Below, RF2 contains moderately continuous downlapping and onlapping reflections interpreted to be partially lithified Pleistocene gravel and cobble valley fill deposits. The underlying facies RF3 is nearly reflection free, but at the larger washes contains weak reflection similar in character to RF2. In the smaller washes, RF3 contains abundant diffractions. Two electrofacies are identified. The shallowest, EF1, extends from the surface to ~2.5 m deep. EF1 encompasses radar facies RF1 and RF2, with resistivity ranging from 250-1500 ohm-m. Estimated soil moisture in this facies ranges from 2-40%, and varies up to 20% laterally over 2-5 m distances in the smallest washes. Facies EF2 coincides with radar facies RF3, with resistivity ranging from 10-300 ohm-m and estimated pore saturation is estimated to exceed 70%. Electrofacies EF1 is inferred to represent a relatively dry surficial layer that includes the modern channel deposits and the upper ~1 m of the Pleistocene strata. At the larger washes, EF2 is interpreted to be Pleistocene valley fill, distinguishable from the overlying lithologically equivalent Pleistocene deposits by lower resistivity resulting from higher moisture content. Near surface lateral soil moisture variations in the smaller washes is strongly influenced by the subsurface stratigraphic architecture (facies RF2). In the larger washes, soil moisture variations are more subtle, changing gradationally with depth and downstream.",

            "abstract": "Arctic sea ice is one of the significant components of the global climate system as it plays a significant role in driving global ocean circulation. Sea ice extent has constantly declined since 1980s. Arctic sea ice thickness has also been diminishing along with the decreasing sea ice extent. Because extent and thickness, two main characteristics of sea ice, are important indicators of the polar response to on-going climate change. Sea ice thickness has been measured with numerous field techniques such as surface drilling and deploying buoys. These techniques provide sparse and discontinuous data in spatiotemporal domain. Spaceborne radar and laser altimeters can overcome these limitations and have been used to estimate sea ice thickness. Ice Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICEsat), a laser altimeter provided data to detect polar area elevation change between 2003 and 2009. CryoSat-2 launched with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)/Interferometric Radar Altimeter (SIRAL) in April 2010 can provide data to estimate time-series of Arctic sea ice thickness.\nIn this study, Arctic sea ice freeboard and thickness between 2011 and 2014 were estimated using CryoSat-2 SAR and SARIn mode data that have sea ice surface height relative to the reference ellipsoid WGS84. In order to estimate sea ice thickness, freeboard, i.e., elevation difference between the top of sea ice surface should be calculated. Freeboard can be estimated through detecting leads. We proposed a novel lead detection approach. CryoSat-2 profiles such as pulse peakiness, backscatter sigma-0, stack standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis were examined to distinguish leads from sea ice. Near-real time cloud-free MODIS images corresponding to CryoSat-2 data measured were used to visually identify leads. Rule-based machine learning approaches such as See5.0 and random forest were used to identify leads. The proposed lead detection approach better distinguished leads from sea ice than the existing approaches. With the freeboard height calculated using the lead detection approach, sea ice thickness was finally estimated using the Archimedes’ buoyancy principle.

            "abstract": "Setting up of any hydrologic model requires a large amount of efforts including compilation of all the data, creation of input files, calibration and validation. Given the amount of efforts involved, it is possible that models for a watershed get created multiple times by multiple groups or organizations to accomplish different research, educational or policy goals. To reduce the duplication of efforts and enable collaboration among different groups or organizations around an already existing hydrology model, a platform is needed where anyone can search for existing models, perform simple scenario analysis and visualize model results. The creator and users of a model on such a platform can then collaborate to accomplish new research or educational objectives. From this perspective, a prototype cyber-infrastructure (CI), called SWATShare, is developed for sharing, running and visualizing Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) models in an interactive GIS-enabled web environment. Users can utilize SWATShare to publish or upload their own models, search and download existing SWAT models developed by others, run simulations including calibration using high performance resources provided by XSEDE and Cloud. Besides running and sharing, SWATShare hosts a novel spatio-temporal visualization system for SWAT model outputs. In temporal scale, the system creates time-series plots for all the hydrology and water quality variables available along the reach as well as in watershed-level. In spatial scale, the system can dynamically generate sub-basin level thematic maps for any variable at any user-defined date or date range; and thereby, allowing users to run animations or download the data for subsequent analyses. In addition to research, SWATShare can also be used within a classroom setting as an educational tool for modeling and comparing the hydrologic processes under different geographic and climatic settings. SWATShare is publicly available at\nhttps://www.water-hub.org/swatshare\n.",

Model estimates of firn properties can help in planning field campaigns and collecting ice cores. No universally accepted firn-evolution model exists, and modeled firn density profiles can be sensitive to the form of the density equation that is used. We can characterize the subtle differences between firn-evolution models by creating comparisons among a suite of published models. We created a table of temperatures and accumulation-rate values spanning the range of climatic conditions in the dry-snow zone in Greenland and Antarctica. Then, we ran each of seven firn-compaction models for each pair of climate values in the table, producing values of close-off depth, depth-integrated porosity, and delta age for each model. Using gridded temperature and accumulation-rate data from Greenland and Antarctica, we interpolated each gridded pair in our model-output tables to create maps of DIP, COD, and Δage for Greenland and Antarctica for each model. We also computed the mean and variance among the models for each property. By identifying the areas of greatest variance in our parameter space, we can better quantify our confidence in the physical descriptions of firn densification in the models.",

            "abstract": "The magnitude of potential flows of elements in tropical ecosystems is not well represented in the literature, even being very important. The Paraíba do Sul River drains the three more economically developed states in Brazil: São Paulo, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro and its basin is considered extremely altered. Despite its economic and social importance (~ 5.3 mi inhabitants), we don’t know much about carbon and nitrogen transport into its rivers and how these are affected by soil use changes. This work aimed to investigate these nutrients, using an isotopic and a biogeochemical approach, at some third order (Paraibuna, Paraitinga and Paraíba do Sul), second and first order rivers, all inserted at the Alto Paraíba do Sul Basin. In general, the low dissolved organic carbon, dissolved inorganic carbon, total dissolved nitrogen and inorganic N concentrations found in the first order rivers, showed the lower variation, despite changes in the soil use. Forested rivers presented higher DOC (3.3 mg.L-1) and TDN (14.2 mM) concentrations than the pasture rivers (2.6 mg.L-1 and 13.8 mM), while these presented higher DIC concentrations than those ones (90.2 mM and 71.2 mM). In third order rivers, the concentrations were also very low. Both carbon and nitrogen contents at the fine and coarse fractions of the suspended particulate material (SPM) were lower at Paraitinga and Paraiba do Sul Rivers. At the Paraibuna River, the fine fraction of SPM presented 25% of C concentration. The concentrations found at the coarse fraction were also higher at this river. The N concentrations were higher at the fine fraction and, consequently, this fraction presented higher C:N ratio. These observations allow us to say that the coarse fraction might be related to plant material, while the fine fraction is probably related to the soils. The δ13C in the SPM was lower in the Paraibuna River, probably due to the predominance of forest, while in the other ones pasture was the main soil use. The Paraibuna River presented the lower δ15N in the SPM results, similar to the results found at the Montane Forest, predominant at this basin, but are lower than the δ15N results found in the soils of the region. The higher results found in the Paraíba do Sul and Paraitinga Rivers may be explained by the highest N losses that occur in pasture grasses and soils.",

            "abstract": "We tested the ecological significance of a geomorphic classification of Sonoran Desert ephemeral stream channels based on channel plan-form, degree of lateral confinement, and boundary material composition. This typology has been shown to discriminate among channel geometry and hydraulic characteristics for bedrock, bedrock with alluvium, incised alluvium, braided, and piedmont headwater channels. We examined stream reach-scale relationships of geomorphic stream types to the relative cover and density of perennial plant species and functional groups, and identified the dominant fluvial drivers, within riparian communities at 101 ephemeral stream reaches on the U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground and Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range in southwestern Arizona, USA. Nonparametric multivariate analysis of variance showed that species and functional group composition differed significantly among geomorphic stream types, both in terms of relative cover and density. Partitioning of among-site multivariate dissimilarity revealed that species compositional differences between stream types were caused largely by variation in the cover and density of the most common members of the regional flora. Distinctive functional group composition among reach types resulted from differences in the cover and density of drought-deciduous shrubs and subshrubs, evergreen trees and shrubs, and photosynthetic-stemmed trees. Comparison of environmental and biotic dissimilarity matrices highlighted the role of channel gradient as the dominant abiotic driver of riparian plant community composition, with stream channel elevation and width:depth providing additional explanatory power. Distinctive riparian plant community composition among the geomorphic stream types demonstrates the ecological significance of this a priori channel classification, and indicates its potential utility in understanding spatial patterns of ecological dynamics, sample stratification for process-based studies, and reference site selection.",

            "abstract": "The record of sedimentary pyrite forms the foundation for most isotope records working to define the coupled evolution and behavior of the ancient iron and sulfur cycles. In order to assess the strengths and limitations of records derived from pyrite-rich rocks (e.g. iron speciation, sulfur isotope ratios), we need to understand more about the processes that form and alter sedimentary pyrite.\nFrom samples of the Archean/early Proterozoic Transvaal and middle Proterozoic Belt Supergroups, petrography reveals that what might operationally be called sedimentary pyrite has complex textures that hint at a rich process history of sulfur mineralization. A common limitation of virtually all proxy measurements employed to date is that they operate on ‘bulk’ samples, typically gram-sized or larger pieces. As such, they lose the ability to relate geochemistry to petrography at the scale of mineral grains. Many of the sedimentary pyrites in the Transvaal Supergroup exhibit complex redox and electronic structures of S and Fe, with crystals of pyrite, pyrrhotite, and sulfate-bearing minerals throughout.\nParallel application of multiple techniques on the same samples across micron bases spatial scales, provide an opportunity to diagnose issues resulting from post-depositional alteration of sedimentary rocks. We have integrated light and electron microscopy for petrography, electron microprobe and synchrotron XRF for elemental composition, synchrotron X-ray spectroscopy for redox and chemical state, and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) for isotopic composition. The coupling of these tools allows in essence “images” of the proxy data at the micrometer scale, giving a wide array of textural and mineralogical information designed to inform and untangle the complicated histories of these early Precambrian rocks.",

Over the past years a number of such cases in normal-polarity thunderstorms have been observed with the Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) deployed near Langmuir Laboratory in south-central New Mexico. The LMA observations show most of the discharges as single-point VHF sources, which can occur at rates of ten or more discharges per second in a localized region near the cloud top.\nCorrelated visual observations of storm tops indicate that the small discharges occur near the cloud boundary of overshooting tops during their upward development, suggesting that the discharges are screening charge flashes between upper positive charge and inferred negative screening charge at the cloud boundary. Some screening charge flashes develop into more extensive breakdown, with negative leaders propagating down several km into the upper positive charge region, while the positive leaders are undetected by the LMA. The more extensive screening charge flashes are characteristic of breakdown associated with blue starters and jets.\nScreening charge flashes can temporarily become the dominant form of negative breakdown into the upper positive charge region, associated with an almost complete lack of intracloud flashes. We speculate that vigorous overshooting convection at high altitude, where the atmosphere has a higher conductivity, produces a rapid accumulation of negative screening charge at the cloud boundary. The accumulated screening charge causes localized regions of strong electric fields between it and the upper positive charge region before diffusing and mixing in.",

            "abstract": "In-stream large wood governs the morphology of many small to intermediate streams, while riparian vegetation influences bank strength and channel pattern. Forest management practices such as harvesting and fire suppression therefore dramatically influence channel processes and associated aquatic habitat. The primary objective of this research is to compare the impacts of three common forest scenarios – natural fire disturbance, forest harvesting with a riparian buffer, and fire suppression – on the volume of in-channel wood and the complexity of aquatic habitat in channels at a range of scales. Each scenario is explored through Monte Carlo simulations run over a period of 1000 years using a numerical reach scale channel simulator (RSCS), with variations in tree toppling rate and forest density used to represent each forest management trajectory. The habitat complexity associated with each scenario is assessed based on the area of the bed occupied by pools and spawning sized sediment, the availability of wood cover, and the probability of avulsion. Within the fire scenario, we also use the model to separately investigate the effects of root decay and recovery on equilibrium channel geometry by varying the rooting depth and associated bank strength through time. The results show that wood loading and habitat complexity are influenced by the timing and magnitude of wood recruitment, as well as channel scale. The forest harvesting scenario produces the lowest wood loads and habitat complexity so long as the buffer width is less than the average mature tree height. The natural fire cycle produces the greatest wood loading and habitat complexity, but also the greatest variability because these streams experience significant periods without wood recruitment as forests regenerate. In reaches that experience recurrent fires, width increases in the post-fire period as roots decay, at times producing a change in channel pattern when a threshold width to depth ratio is exceeded, and decreases as the forest regenerates. In all cases, the effects are greatest in small to intermediate sized streams where wood is the dominant driver of channel morphology, and become negligible in large streams governed by fluvial processes.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol formation events have been studied in depth over the past few decades, yet large uncertainties remain on the mechanisms responsible for the generation of new particles. At a rural/urban research facility in Beltsville, MD ultrafine and fine mode aerosol number and size distributions were collected during July 2011 along with volatile organic compounds canister samples. Multiple particle growth events (PGEs) were detected during the summer and occurred on days following strong synoptic cold frontal passages. Though these events occurred in clean air masses, moderate sulfur dioxide (SO2) mixing ratios were observed during the PGEs. A chemical-box with the Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Mechanism, version 2 (RACM2) was used to simulate the gas-phased chemical species concentrations during the PGEs. Simulated chemical mixing ratios from the RACM2 box model were used as input to an equilibrium aerosol model, the Simulating Composition of Atmospheric Particle at Equilibrium, version 2 (SCAPE2) that was used to estimate the state and composition of the aerosols. The goal of this research was to determine whether SO2 was contributing to the growth of the PGEs and to have a better understanding of the mechanism responsible for the formation of the PGEs. This research is significant because some of the largest uncertainties in observations and model results are determining the mechanisms that create and grow new particles throughout the lower atmosphere and their role on air quality, cloud formation, and climate.",

            "abstract": "We are investigating a mission architecture concept for low-cost pre-processing of materials on long synodic period asteroids using bioengineered microbes delivered by small spacecraft.\nSpace exploration opportunities, particularly those requiring a human presence, are sharply constrained by the high cost of launching resources such as fuel, construction materials, oxygen, water, and foodstuffs. Near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) have been proposed for supporting a human space presence. However, the combination of high initial investment requirements, delayed potential return, and uncertainty in resource payoff currently prevents their effective utilization.\nBiomining is the process in which microorganisms perform useful material reduction, sequestration or separation. It is commonly used in terrestrial copper extraction. Compared to physical and chemical methods of extraction it is slow, but very low cost, thus rendering economical even very poor ores. These advantages are potentially extensible to asteroid in situ resource utilization (ISRU).\nOne of the first limiting factors for the use of biology in these environments is temperature. A survey of NEA data was conducted to identify those NEAs whose projected interior temperatures remained within both potential (-5 - 100 ºC) and preferred (15 - 45 ºC) ranges for the minimum projected time per synodic period without exceeding 100 ºC at any point. Approximately 2800 of the 11000 NEAs (25%) are predicted to remain within the potential range for at least 90 days, and 120 (1%) in the preferred range.\nA second major factor is water availability and stability. We have evaluated a design for a small-spacecraft-based injector which forces low-temperature fluid into the NEA interior, creating potentially habitable microniches. The fluid contains microbes genetically engineered to accelerate the degradation rates of a desired fraction of the native resources, allowing for more efficient material extraction upon a subsequent encounter.",

            "abstract": "Cultivation of cover crops in the vineyard inter-row has been shown to have numerous benefits, but tests of the potential C sequestration benefits in perennial crops is limited. We investigated the impacts of three different between vine-row soil management treatments: a cover crop under minimum tillage (CC+mow); a cover crop mowed and incorporated to the soil in spring (CC+till); and a native weeds cover managed in the conventional manner (till), on root production and soil respiration (Rs) in a vineyard. Soil CO2 flux, gravimetric water content (qg) and total C, as well as leaf water potential, were monitored during a year. In early summer, a 1.5m deep trench per treatment was excavated, and three 15L soil samples were taken at 5 depths to determine the root distribution and total biomass. The root biomass was higher in the “CC+mow” treatment over the “till”, especially the fine roots in the topsoil layer. The conventional vine-row management showed the highest yearly CO2 emission from Rs. The changes in the soil structure and therefore water retention resulting from the treatments, mainly in the topsoil layer, may explain the Rs differences. Our results point to conservation tillage as resource to enhance C sequestration in grapevine.",

            "abstract": "Orthopyroxene is the second most common mineral in the Earth’s upper mantle. However, very little is known about its strength relative to olivine and clinopyroxene, both of which are well studied. Analyses of microstructures in peridotites containing orthopyroxene and olivine that were deformed at lithospheric conditions (relatively low temperatures and pressures) indicate that the orthopyroxene is stronger than surrounding olivine. In contrast, analyses of microstructures in asthenospheric peridotite xenoliths indicate that olivine and orthopyroxene have similar strengths.\nIn order to better determine the pressure, temperature and strain rate sensitivity of the strength of orthopyroxene aggregates, we have performed an experimental study on stacked cylinders of orthopyroxene aggregates and olivine aggregates in the D-DIA. Cylinders of Bamble orthopyroxene (d~5-30 microns) or San Carlos olivine (d~25 microns) were hot-pressed in-situ at 1300oC for 1 hour prior to deformation. Although the assemblies and powders were dried at >100oC for >12 hours prior to installation in the apparatus, minor concentrations of water were observed (OPx ~ 500 H/106 Si; Ol ~ 200 H/106 Si). Multiple deformation steps were performed in each experiment over a range of strain rates (5x10-6 to 2x10-4/s) at a single temperature and pressure (T = 1000 – 1400oC and P = 2 – 5 GPa).\nAt almost all conditions tested in these experiments, the orthopyroxene aggregates deformed at the same strain rate as the olivine cylinders, indicating both materials have the same stress exponent and very similar activation enthalpy. The microstructures observed in both the orthopyroxene and olivine cylinders are consistent with dislocation creep and lattice preferred orientations consistent with those observed in naturally deformed peridotites. These results indicate that at asthenospheric mantle conditions, the strengths of orthopyroxene and olivine in the dislocation creep field are very similar.",

            "abstract": "The Next Generation Science Standards (2014) will begin to change how K-12 teachers teach science. Using a scaffolding approach, the standards focus on a depth of knowledge across multiple content areas. This philosophy should encourage inquiry-based teaching methods, provided the teacher has both the knowledge and the confidence to teach the content. Although confidence to teach science is high among secondary science (biology, general science, chemistry) teachers, depth of knowledge may be lacking in certain areas, including climate science. To address this issue, a graduate course in climate science (Massachusetts Colleges Online Course of Distinction award winner) was developed to include inquiry-based instruction, connections to current research, and interdisciplinary approaches to teaching science. With the support of the InTeGrate program (SERC) at Carleton College, a module was developed to utilize cli-fi (climate science present in fictional literature) and related climate data. Graduate students gain an appreciation of scientific communication and an understanding of climate data and its connection to societal issues. In addition, the graduate students also gain the ability to connect interdisciplinary concepts for a deeper understanding of climate science and have the opportunity. By the end of the course, the graduate students use the content learned and the examples of pedagogical tools to develop their own activities in his or her classroom.",

            "abstract": "Two aspects of the Triassic/Jurassic transition that seem incongruous are increasing warming and increasing ecological dominance by siliceous sponges on shallow shelves. Warming is interpreted from proxy data showing increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations associated with eruption pulses of the Central Atlantic Province (CAMP) basalts across rifting Pangea. Post-extinction ecological dominance by siliceous sponges is found in recent field investigations of Nevada and Peru, and literature on the Austrian Alps. Whereas evidence from the Panthalassan siliceous sponge ramps of the early Jurassic clearly records deposition on sub- and tropical shallow shelves (a warm environment), modern sponge occupations of comparable intensity exist only in deep and cold environments. Resolving this apparent contrast requires consideration of silica cycling.\nSilica is a limiting nutrient for siliceous sponges, and the post-extinction sponges of the earliest Jurassic show desmid spicule morphologies matching modern phenotypic indicators of high silica concentration. During the Triassic the major documented biosiliceous sink was radiolarian deep sea chert deposits despite a major species-level turnover at the extinction. Diatoms did not exist in the Triassic. A major alteration to silica cycling in the early Jurassic could have resulted from increased terrigenous supply for two reasons: increased atmospheric carbon dioxide would likely intensify continental weathering, and the extensive flood basalts produced an easily-weathered silica source. Simple box model calculations allow consideration of supply vs demand, and of the pace of possible changes. Potential weathering rates of silica are contrasted with recent published data on sponge silica sequestration, showing that the presence of the CAMP basalts alone could support increased sponge abundance across tropical carbonate shelves. Estimates of doubling and residence times in a simple one-box model show that the change in silica concentration likely occurred over hundred-thousand year timescales relevant to the post-extinction ecology. The influence of climate and weathering on marine chemistry and ecological opportunity presents an excellent example of interrelated Earth and life systems at a critical transition point.",

            "abstract": "The Chihshang fault, one segment of the plate suture between the Eurasian and the Philippine Sea plates in eastern Taiwan, is a rapid creeping reverse fault, which has been considered to show interseismic creep near the surface while contemporaneously being capable of producing large earthquakes at depth. In order to understand its seismic hazard, we integrate the near-fault total station measurements and the data from 10 campaign GPS stations for analyzing the nature of creep with 25 continuous GPS observations and the data from PsInSAR method for recognizing the kinematics of deep seismogenic zone. The GPS coordinate daily solution is calculated using the software Bernese v.5.0 under the ITRF2008. Horizontal velocity field is relative to the station S01R located in Penghu island. The average velocity of six campaign-mode GPS stations is about 47.9 mm/yr with the azimuth of 296° at southern segment of the Chihshang fault. The average velocity of the other four campaign-mode GPS stations is about 67.5 mm/yr with the azimuth of 307° at the central segment of the fault. Continuous GPS stations show a great horizontal velocity decreases from hanging wall (eastern side) to footwall (western side). Velocities for stations on the eastern side of the Chihshang fault are 62.5–84.4 mm/yr in directions 291°–314°, whereas those on the western side of the Chihshang fault hanging wall are 24.8–45.3 mm/yr in directions 294°–304°. A major discontinuity about 30 mm/yr on the rate of crustal motion across the Chihshang fault is believed to be the aseismic slip along the fault. Next step, the PSInSAR methods and total station data will be used and integrated with other geodetic data to monitor a wide range of surface activities in the Eastern Taiwan. Finally we hope to reveal the spatiotemporal nature of the creep on the Chihshang fault for helping us associating the creep with potential lithological controls, and providing a new perspective to better understand the underlying causes and mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "The seismic hazard of the Hengchun fault in the southernmost tip of Taiwan has been concerned for a long time due to the discrepancy between long-term and short-term vertical motion. The long-term uplift is inferred from the dating data of the oceanic terraces across of the Hengchun fault while the short-term subsidence is derived from the geodetic data from 2002 to 2006. In this study, we therefore first adopted the GPS observations and precise leveling measurements during 2002-2013 to comprehend the kinematics of the active fault in Hengchun peninsula and its seismic hazard. Three different deformation patterns are revealed in three stages separating by the 2006 ML 7.0 Pingtung offshore earthquake and April 2010. Before the 2006 earthquake (stage 1), subsidence rate of ~2.0 mm/yr are shown across the Hengchun fault. After the 2006 event (stage 2), the subsidence rate in the western region is ~3.2 mm/yr, while the eastern region has a 2.5 mm/yr uplift rate. After April 2010 (stage 3), the western region starts to show minor uplift at the rate of 0.1 mm/yr, and the eastern region displays a 2.3 mm/yr uplift rate. With the average vertical velocity of the southern leveling route decreased by 0.6 mm/yr and the northern leveling route increased by 3.2 mm/yr, we observed a northward propagating trend of the vertical component during the December 2006 – April 2013 period. For the horizontal velocity field, azimuths of the velocity change from 275° to 270° in southwestern region after the 2006 event. After April 2010, azimuths change again from 290° to 292° in eastern region. Based on our preliminary tests, the velocity changes in three stages are not significantly contributed by the postseismic deformation associated with the 2006 Pingtung earthquake. On the contrary, the increase Coulomb stress change triggers the aseismic creep on the high angle Hengchun reverse fault. To further analyze the kinematics of this fault, we will include the PSInSAR technique and kinematic model in this study in the future to understand the seismic hazard of the Hengchun fault.",

USArray is a 15-year program to place a dense network of permanent and portable seismographs across the continental United States and parts of Canada. The seismographs record local, regional, and distant (teleseismic) earthquakes. The array records seismic waves that propagate through finer and finer slices of the earth enabling scientists to link structures inherited from earlier stages of continental formation to known and potential geologic hazards (e.g., earthquakes, volcanoes, landslides) (\nwww.usarray.org\n). USArray deployment in Canada will complement existing Canadian seismic network(s). This project will be particularly significant in the St. Elias region of southwest Yukon, northwest British Columbia, and southeast Alaska as this one of the most seismically active areas and tectonically complex areas in Canada . The deployment will complement ongoing geological mapping carried out by both Yukon Geological Survey, the Geological Survey of Canada and several universities.

Relatively little is known about coarse mode (supermicron) aerosols, notably dust, volcanic ash and sea salt. Asian dust is a regular springtime event whose optical and radiative forcing effects have been fairly well documented at the lower latitudes over North America but rarely reported for the Arctic. Volcanic ash, whose socio-economic importance has grown dramatically since the fear of its effects on aircraft engines resulted in the virtual shutdown of European civil aviation in the spring of 2010 has rarely been reported in the Arctic in spite of the likely probability that ash from Iceland and the Aleutian Islands makes its way into the Arctic and possibly the high Arctic. Little is known about Arctic sea salt aerosols and we are not aware of any literature on the optical measurement of these aerosols.\nIn this work we present preliminary results of the combined sunphotometry-lidar analysis at two High Arctic stations in North America: PEARL (80°N, 86°W) for 2007-2011 and Barrow (71°N,156°W) for 2011-2014. The multi-years datasets were analyzed to single out potential coarse mode incursions and study their optical characteristics. In particular, CIMEL sunphotometers provided coarse mode optical depths as well as information on particle size and refractive index. Lidar measurements from High Spectral Resolution lidars (AHSRL at PEARL and NSHSRL at Barrow) yielded vertically resolved aerosol profiles and gave an indication of particle shape and size from the depolarization ratio and color ratio profiles. Additionally, we employed supplementary analyses of HYSPLIT backtrajectories, OMI aerosol index, and NAAPS (Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System) outputs to study the spatial context of given events.",

            "abstract": "In July 2014, we obtained a total of 94 km of high-resolution Chirp profiles from the 129 km2, brackish Lake Azuey and 37 km of profiles from the 14 km2, fresh water Lake Mirogoane that both straddle the active trace of the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone (EPGFZ) of Haiti. 80% of the grid on Azuey and 85% on Mirogoane was dedicated to north-south profiles of the EPGFZ. In Azuey we defined the linear and east-west-striking fault trace in deformed Holocene sediments along with its landfalls west of Lake Azuey in Haiti and east of Lake Azuey in the Dominican Republic. All profiles showed the fault to be a sub-vertical flower structure whose active traces could be traced on Chirp data to a depth of 30 m below the lake floor. Previous workers have suggested that this fault ruptured during a large November, 1751, earthquake with a parallel and elongate felt zone. We hypothesize the most recent break of the fault several meters below the lake floor to have formed during the 1751 event but plan a coring program to precisely constrain the timing of historical and prehistorical events based on syn-faulting colluvial wedges observed on Chirp profiles. Our survey of Mirogoane confirmed its rhomboidal pull-apart structure with the basin center at a depth of 42-8 m making this basin the deepest lake in the Caribbean region. Deformational features include active folds at the lake bottom, large oblique-slip normal faults at an angle to the bounding east-west faults, and 30 m of recognizable stratigraphy. The 7 m of Holocene cored in the basin center in 1988 is observed to be highly deformed and locally folded and overlies with angular unconformity a well stratified and more folded lower basinal unit. Historical events are proposed to have ruptured on or near this segment of the EPGFZ in 1701 and 1770.",

            "abstract": "The changes of ice sheet in Greenland have been traced through various remote sensing observations. However, it was realised that the uncertainties in the observed change of ice sheet were not fully addressed. Therefore, we devised and tested a scheme employing multiple sensor satellite data and the data fusion to spatially and temporally monitor the migration of glacier with high accuracy. The test area was established in Russell glacier in western Greenland where the change of glacier has been obvious for the last century.\nFirstly, differential interferometric SAR (D-InSAR) campaigns using ALOS PALSAR pairs were applied to monitor the glacial change. In terms of data fusion aspect, we then employed pixel tracing method by co-registration of ALOS PRISM optical images over target area to compensate for any line-of-sight glacial movement resulted by the D-InSAR analysis. To securely trace individual pixel, high accuracy sub-pixel co-registration algorithm was developed. Meanwhile, PALSAR pairs were also applied to test the amplitude tracking method in the same manner. To address the temporal difference between the acquisition of SAR and optical images, the velocity vectors considering seasonal mean migration were interpolated. At last, the outputs from analyses were incorporated to build an effective 3D movement tracing over Russell glacier.\nFurthermore, in order to investigate the glacial migration process, the hydrodynamic simulations employing optical stereo pairs and InSAR DTMs over meltwater outflow channels, such as Akuliarusiarsuup Kuua and Qinnguata Kuussua from Russell glacier, were conducted simultaneously with the tracking of the geometric movement of glacier. The overall results were anticipated to be incorporated for the understanding of long term change of Russell glacier. Based on the output of this case study, the proposed method will be extended into a comprehensive scheme to tackle the issues of ice sheet change occurred in the Greenland.",

            "abstract": "The Selenga River delta, Lake Baikal, Russia, is approximately 700 km2 in size and contains three active lobes that receive varying amounts of water and sediment discharge. This delta represents a unique end-member in so far that the system is positioned along the deep-water (~1500 m) margin of Lake Baikal and therefore exists as a shelf-edge delta. In order to evaluate the morphological dynamics of the Selenga delta, field expeditions were undertaken during July 2013 and 2014, to investigate the morphologic, sedimentologic, and hydraulic nature of this delta system. Single-beam bathymetry data, sidescan sonar data, sediment samples, and aerial survey data were collected and analyzed to constrain: 1) channel geometries within the delta, 2) bedform sizes and spatial distributions, 3) grain size composition of channel bed sediment as well as bank sediment, collected from both major and minor distributary channels, and 4) elevation range of the subaerial portion of the delta. Our data indicate that the delta possesses downstream sediment fining, ranging from predominantly gravel and sand near the delta apex to silt and sand at the delta-lake interface. Field surveys also indicate that the Selenga delta has both eroding and aggrading banks, and that the delta is actively incising into some banks that consist of terraces, which are defined as regions that are not inundated by typical 2- to 4-year flood discharge events. Therefore the terraces are distinct from the actively accreting regions of the delta that receive sedimentation via water inundation during regular river floods. We spatially constrain the regions of the Selenga delta that are inundated during floods versus terraced using a 1-D water-surface hydrodynamic model that produces estimates of stage for flood water discharges, whereby local water surface elevations produced with the model are compared to the measured terrestrial elevations. Our analyses show that terrace elevations steadily decrease downstream for all lobes, and that the delta is undergoing an active phase of erosion, characterized by channel incision and extensive lateral erosion of terraces; this process of delta ‘self-cannibalization’ contributes to the downstream sediment flux and morphological evolution of the delta.",

            "abstract": "Published research continues to report that long-term, local-scale precipitation forecasts are too uncertain to support local-scale adaptation. Numerous studies quantify the range of uncertainty in downscaled model output; compare this with uncertainty from other sources such as hydrological modeling; and propose circumventing uncertainty via “soft” or “low regret” actions, or adaptive management. Yet non-structural adaptations alone are likely insufficient. Structural adaptation requires quantified engineering design specifications. However, the literature does not define a tolerable level of uncertainty. Without such a benchmark, how can we determine whether the climate-change-cognizant design specifications that we are capable of, for example the climate change factors increasingly utilized in European practice, are viable?\nThe presentation will explore this question, in the context of reporting results and observations from an ongoing ten-year program assessing local-scale stormwater drainage system vulnerabilities, required capacities, and adaptation options and costs. This program has studied stormwater systems of varying complexity in a variety of regions, topographies, and levels of urbanization, in northern-New England and the upper-Midwestern United States. These studies demonstrate the feasibility of local-scale design specifications, and provide tangible information on risk to enable valid cost/benefit decisions. The research program has found that stormwater planners and engineers have routinely accepted, in the normal course of professional practice, a level of uncertainty in hydrological modeling comparable to that in long-term precipitation projections. Moreover, the ability to quantify required capacity and related construction costs for specific climate change scenarios, the insensitivity of capacity and costs to uncertainty, and the percentage of pipes and culverts that never require upsizing, all serve to limit the impact of uncertainty inherent in climate change projections.",

            "abstract": "The global coastal ocean and watersheds are divided into 66 Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs), which encompass regions from river basins, estuaries, and coasts to the seaward boundaries of continental shelves and margins of major currents. Approximately 80% of global fisheries catch comes from LME waters. Ecosystem goods and services from LMEs contribute an estimated $US 18-25 trillion dollars annually to the global economy in market and non-market value. The critical importance of these large-scale systems, however, is threatened by human populations and pressures, including climate change. Fortunately, there is pragmatic reason for optimism. Interdisciplinary frameworks exist, such as the Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) approach for adaptive management that can integrate both nature-centric and human-centric views into ecosystem monitoring, assessment, and adaptive management practices for long-term sustainability. Originally proposed almost 30 years ago, the LME approach rests on five modules are: (i) productivity, (ii) fish and fisheries, (iii) pollution and ecosystem health, (iv) socioeconomics, and (v) governance for iterative adaptive management at a large, international scale of 200,000 km2 or greater. The Global Environment Facility (GEF), World Bank, and United Nations agencies recognize and support the LME approach—as evidenced by over $3.15 billion in financial assistance to date for LME projects. This year of 2014 is an exciting milestone in LME history, after 20 years of the United Nations and GEF organizations adopting LMEs as a unit for ecosystem-based approaches to management. The LME approach, however, is not perfect. Nor is it immutable. Similar to the adaptive management framework it propones, the LME approach itself must adapt to new and emerging 21st Century technologies, science, and realities. The LME approach must further consider socioeconomics and governance. Within the socioeconomics module alone, several trillion-dollar opportunities exist for interdisciplinary integration with best practices in: (i) water-energy nexus infrastructure; (ii) responsible tourism; and (iii) open data innovations.",

Ideally, both of these instruments would have response times >= 10Hz to capture the main contributing scales of turbulent transport. However, depending on the system design and infrastructure limitations, high-frequency spectral corrections can exceed 20% of the initial uncorrected flux. The objective of this study is to devise an optimal design that (i) maximizes system viability, and (ii) minimizes high-frequency spectral loss.\nA closed-path LI-COR LI-7200 was selected and multiple combinations of the analyzer and different system components were tested in the laboratory to determine the frequency response of the individual components. This allowed for identifying and improving system bottlenecks in regards to frequency response. Comprehensive field experiments were performed including conditions of condensation which allowed for confirmation of the integral performance of the entire system under field conditions, and aided in determining the optimal setting of the intake tube and particle filter heating. The final system design yields a three-fold improvement of response at 10 Hz and reduces the occurrence of problematic humidity level (RH > 60%) within the analyzer cell by 50%.",

            "abstract": "A thorough understanding of the behavior of deep sea pipes is crucial for off-shore oil & gas industry. During the service life, network of oil and gas pipelines that connect the floating platforms to the subsea wells in deepwater undergo significant changes in temperature and pressure resulting in high shears, strains and movement. These pipelines laid on the very soft seabed become susceptible to large movement and lateral buckling resulting in global instability of the entire system. Hence, it is of paramount importance to address the aforementioned issues through combined numerical modeling and experimental study of various conditions in the field. Modeling this behavior needs to take into account the complex interactions between pipe, water, and soil (which, in this case, will be a saturated porous media). Physical experiments can be challenging as the undrained shear strength is very low of the order of 0.01 kPa. In this research, we have performed large-scale experiments as well as numerical modeling. Several full-scale models have been designed and constructed to investigate the behavior of various types of pipes (steel, plastic) on the simulated clayey sea bed (undrained shear strength ranged from 0.01 kPa to 0.11 kPa). Axial and lateral pipe soil interactions have been characterized, and appropriate mitigation solutions for axial walking and lateral buckling have been proposed. On the numerical modeling front, the pipe-soil behavior is simulated using the Coupled Eulerian Lagrangian (CEL) and Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulations.",

            "abstract": "Triaxial compression experiments were conducted on a permeable quartz sandstone under argon pore fluid and vented conditions at temperatures to 900°C and effective pressures to 175 MPa. Vented tests exhibit a transition from brittle faulting towards thermally-activated cataclastic flow. Microfracture density and acoustic emissions indicate that the transition corresponds to a change in mechanism from rate-insensitive fracture to subcritical cracking. We conclude that the transition occurs when shear microfracture propagation and macroscopic shear localization are suppressed under increased grain-scale fracture energy and reduced dilatancy. A comparison of the two tests shows that pore fluid has little influence on the failure behavior at low temperatures. Conversely, pore fluid tests exhibit substantially smaller strengths and enhanced ductility than those of vented tests at high temperatures and pressures, similar to weakening induced by decreasing strain rate in the water-saturated sandstone at room temperature. We infer that the observed weakening results from an enhancement in intergranular frictional slip involving subcritical cracking where retained intracrystalline water reduced fracture energy. We are characterizing detailed microstructures and finite strain fields in samples deformed at varied strains, as well as evolution in volume strain and other inelastic properties, to further constrain the pore fluid effects on shear localization processes.",

            "abstract": "We evaluate a long-period ground motion hazard for the Nankai Trough earthquakes (M8~9) in west Japan. Past large earthquakes in the Nankai Trough that have occurred in an interval of 100~200 years showed various occurrence patterns and caused serious damages due to strong ground motion and tsunami. However, such large interplate earthquake potentially causes damages due to long-period ground motion even at long-distance basins. For evaluating the long-period ground motion of large earthquakes, it is important to take into account the uncertainty of source model and the effect of 3-D underground structure. In this study, we evaluate the long-period ground motion by the finite difference method (FDM) using \"characterized source models\" and the 3-D underground structure model. We construct various characterized source models (369 scenarios). Although most of parameters of the model are determined based on the \"recipe\" for predicting strong ground motion, we assume various possible source parameters including rupture area, asperity configuration, and hypocenter location. To perform the large-scale simulation for many source models, we apply a 3-D FDM scheme using discontinuous grids and utilize the GPGPU for our simulation. We use the system called GMS (Ground Motion Simulator) for the FD simulation. The grid spacing for the shallow region is 200 m and 100 m in horizontal and vertical, respectively. The grid spacing for the deep region is three times coarser. The total number of grid points is about 3.2 billion, which is about the eighth in the case of using uniform grids. We use GMS adapted for multi GPU simulation on the supercomputer TSUBAME operated by Tokyo Institute of Technology. Simulated peak ground velocity (PGV) and velocity response spectra (Sv) are strongly affected by the hypocenter location and show a large variation up to 10-fold at each site even in a group that have the same source area. We evaluate hazard curves and maps for PGV and Sv using the simulation results by assuming the occurrence probability of each scenario. The hazard maps for lower conditional exceedance probability clearly show that the long-period ground motions are amplified particularly at sedimentary basins. Our future study will consider the uncertainty of the underground structure model and the source modeling not following the recipe.",

The objectives of this study were: to quantify the magnitude of isotopic desiquilibrium (Deq) in a temperate deciduous forest throughout the growing season, and to determine the sensitivity of Deq to CO2 hydration efficiency. In this study, C18OO and H218O composition of the air were measured quasi-continuously and simultaneously above a temperate deciduous forest using tunable diode laser trace gas analyzers. In addition, detailed measurements of H218O composition of ecosystem water pools were performed throughout the experimental period. These field measurements were used with existing formulations to estimate the C18OO of soil (δR) and canopy (δR) CO2 fluxes. Values of δA also showed large day to day variation in our site. The dynamics of δR was mainly driven by changes in soil water isotope composition, caused by precipitation events. The magnitude of Deq was variable throughout the season and very sensitive to the extent of the CO2 hydration in the canopy. In this ecosystem, for most of the growing season, the magnitude of Deq was inversely proportional to θeq. This can be explained by the very negative δR signal in our ecosystem.",

            "abstract": "One of the major feature of tropical precipitation is the seasonal movement of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Linear trend analyses of observational rainfall data show global trend patterns of opposite changes near the ITC regions. High-resolution monthly oceanic rainfall data derived from microwave observations by the Remote Sensing Systems are examined to characterize the trend and variability of the North Pacific Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) for the period 1988–2012. Position of the ITCZ is defined as the centroid of rain band between 15°N and equator for each longitude. The climatology captures the seasonal cycle of meridional migration of the ITCZ. The North Pacific ITCZ location shows significant southward shift of 0.3–0.5° decade–1 in the annual mean and in all seasons except for northern spring with El Niño-Southern Oscillation signal removed. Empirical orthogonal function analyses of the ITCZ position anomalies in the northern summer and autumn indicates a distinct difference in the ITCZ long-term variability between the western North Pacific and the eastern North Pacific, with more pronounced southward shift in the western North Pacific. The technique is applied to other rainfall data sets to characterize the temporal and spatial variability of the ITCZ movements.",

            "abstract": "The strontium isotopic composition of seawater has varied throughout Earth history in response to the balance between Sr isotopic exchange with ocean crust and input of riverine Sr derived from continental weathering. Because of this, seawater 87Sr/86Sr highs are interpreted to reflect erosion events, related to mountain building, while 87Sr/86Sr lows are considered to result from low weathering rates or increased seafloor spreading. Seawater 87Sr/86Sr also responds to changes in the isotopic composition of material undergoing weathering. The largest ever increase in seawater 87Sr/86Sr took place sometime from approximately 900 Ma to 500 Ma, and was associated with a permanent step shift in baseline 87Sr/86Sr composition. The unprecedented size of this increase, its timing and causation remains unconstrained. This study attempts firstly to reconstruct global seawater 87Sr/86Sr trends through this increase, using well-preserved carbonate rock samples from the North China craton, calibrated against additional 87Sr/86Sr and δ13C data from Neoproterozoic samples collected from other sections around the world. Sample preparation techniques for bulk carbonate Sr isotope stratigraphy are being honed during the course of this study. Other stable isotope systems (δ13C and δ18O) and trace elements, including REE have been investigated on the same samples to identify pristine samples for Sr isotope analysis and help in interpretation. The newly obtained data from this study (mainly Huaibei group of Huaibei area), using the excellently preserved early marine calcite cements and some bulk rock samples, confirm that the carbonate strata across the Jiao-Liao-Xu-Huai stratigraphic realm of the North China Craton exhibit the moderately positive δ13C values and low 87Sr/86Sr values that are characteristic of the early Neoproterozoic (Tonian).The results help to recreate the global curve by linking negative excursions in the Shijia (Xuzhou) (Xiao et al., 2014, Precambr. Res., 246, 208-225) Formation with the global ~ 810Ma ‘Bitter Springs Anomaly’. A first attempt at a Neoproterozoic Sr isotope curve has been reconstructed using our unpublished data and published data from Halverson et al. (2007, Palaeogeog., Palaeoclim., Palaeoecol., 256, 103-129) and Sawaki et al. (2010, Precambr. Res., 179, 150-164).",

            "abstract": "The use of wavelet analysis has been increasing in geophysical sciences over the past 20 years. Its ability to decompose a time series into its frequency components while maintaining their localization in time provides valuable information on the mechanistic properties influencing turbulent exchange. Compared to Fourier transforms, Wavelet analysis is well suited to analyze non-stationary signals and provides high temporal resolution without dismissing longer wavelength contributions.\nOne goal of NEON is to provide high quality ecosystem exchange observations to the science community, and wavelet analysis is one tool that enables multiple data processing pathways, such as; (i) high- and low-frequency spectral corrections, (ii) comparison to spectral references, (iii) evaluation of flow characteristics in complex terrain, (iv) high-frequency EC flux processing and source area calculations (≈60 h−1), and (v) inferring the flux field around tower measurements.\nHere, we provide an overview of how Wavelet analyses are integrated into NEON’s ecosystem exchange data processing framework. Preliminary results include: (i) Changes in soil CO2 concentration are dominated on timescales >0.5 h, which informs the frequency response correction of a very slow but robust, diffusion-based soil CO2 sensor; (ii) Source area calculations explain significant spatial variation when resolved at the integral timescale of atmospheric turbulence; and (iii) our companion presentations “Towards the spatial rectification of tower-based eddy-covariance flux observations” and “Assessing and correcting spatial representativeness of tower eddy-covariance flux measurements” demonstrate how Wavelet analysis facilitates inferring the flux field around tower measurements.",

            "abstract": "The intramontane Guadix-Baza Basin (SE Spain) preserves an extensive record of Neogene continental sedimentation during an interval of important global climatic and ecologic changes, including the onset Northern Hemisphere glaciation and the evolution of grassland biomes on several continents. Several localities within this basin represent mammal biostratigraphic reference sections for the Plio-Pleistocene of Western Europe, and have been the focus of much previous bio-, magneto-, and cyclostratigraphic work. Here we report new stratigraphic and geochemical results from one of these reference sections near the village of Zújar in the central part of the Guadix-Baza Basin. We interpret Plio-Pleistocene climatic history from lacustrine and pedogenic sediments at Zújar, based on new paleomagnetic results coupled with stable carbon and oxygen isotopic (δ13C and δ18O) analyses of carbonate and bulk organic matter, thin-section petrography, cathodoluminescence and scanning electron microscopy, and semi-quantitative X-ray diffraction.\nPaleoclimatic variability in the Zújar section is reflected in the highly variable composition of carbonate-rich beds, which fluctuate between nearly pure micritic calcite and dolomite but commonly display mixed carbonate phases. The δ18O values of these carbonates are also highly variable (-8.2 to +1.9‰ VPDB) and are strongly correlated with dolomite content (r2 = 0.79). The δ13C values are less variable (-8.8‰ to -4.2‰ VPDB) and are similar between calcite- and dolomite-rich samples. We interpret periods of wet climate and lake-level highstand from calcite-dominated beds with variable δ13C values and low (-7 to -8‰ VPDB), invariant δ18O values that likely represent equilibrium calcite precipitation from minimally evolved lake source waters. Several mixed-carbonate beds display covariant δ13C and δ18O, representing evaporative enrichment of lake waters during more arid periods. We interpret maximum aridity and lake-level lowstand in the Zújar section from dolomite-rich palustrine beds with evidence of subaerial exposure (root traces, microkarst). The δ18O values of these beds are up to 6‰ higher than that expected for dolomite in equilibrium with mean δ18O for the calcite-dominated beds, and likely represent waters heavily influenced by evaporation.",

Adaptation measures are available for many health impacts in the US, but they may not be able to completely prevent impacts, especially if climate change becomes more severe in the future. And many measures undertaken to limit greenhouse gas emissions or increase resilience to climate impacts in other sectors have the potential to improve, or in some cases, harm, human health.

            "abstract": "Land-use change alters the magnitudes and variability of soil respiration (Rs). However, the importance of ecosystem and landscape drivers of Rs remain poorly understood from an empirical and mechanistic standpoint and likely vary across climate gradients. To address this knowledge gap we asked, what regulates the spatial and temporal variation of Rs across a human dominated region? From a landscape perspective, climate and land-use are hypothesized to be key drivers of Rs. From a soil physiological perspective, variability in temperature, moisture, and substrate availability regulate Rs. According to an inverse metabolic activity hypothesis, systems with higher metabolic activity will have less temporal variability in Rs than those with lower rates. Alternatively, soil substrate availability may drive sensitivity of Rs to water inputs. To quantify variability in Rs and test hypotheses of its regulation we deployed an Rs sensor network beginning in November 2013 with nodes distributed across three land-use types ─ lawn, agriculture, and wildland ─ at three sub-regions spanning a coastal to inland to desert climate gradient (total 9 sites, 3 land-uses x 3 sub-regions). At each node we are measuring soil Rs using the flux gradient approach, which includes soil state CO2 sensors, temperature, and moisture measured at three depths and at five minute intervals.\nWe analyzed the data for the winter sampling period, which is southern California's rainy season. The mean of Rs was lowest at the coastal and highest in the desert sub-regions for both lawn (3.99 and 4.7 μmol CO2 m-2 s-1) and wildland (0.23 and 0.49 μmol CO2 m-2 s-1)  land-uses. Rs was the highest in the inland sub-region for agricultural land-uses (4.1 μmol CO2 m-2 s-1). Lawn and wildland land-uses had increasing coefficient of variation in Rs across the coastal to desert climate gradient, while agriculture had decreasing variation. Sites that had higher mean fluxes and soil organic matter, a proxy for substrate availability, also had higher variability, supporting the hypothesis on substrate regulation of Rs sensitivity to water inputs. As urban centers spread in the arid and semi-arid Southwest, the likely consequences of land-use change will be increased magnitude and variance in Rs as the result of increased soil nutrient and water inputs.",

            "abstract": "Estimates of the total power radiated by Enceladus' tiger stripes are constrained by Cassini CIRS observations of the thermal emission from the tiger stripe region. Unfortunately, these data have several limitations imposed by the nature of the CIRS instrument, and the very limited time available for high resolution observations of Enceladus' south pole. Short-wavelength (7 - 16 micron) maps have complete coverage with good spatial resolution, but do not capture the bulk of the radiated power, which is emitted at longer wavelengths. Long-wavelength (> 16 micron) maps which capture most of the emission have either very limited spatial coverage, or spatial resolution insufficient to separate the tiger stripes from background thermal emission. In Howett et al. (2011) we estimated ~16 GW of total endogenic heat flow based on low-resolution long-wavelength data. This estimate required model-dependent assumptions about passive background thermal emission, which was not directly separated spatially from the tiger stripes, but included potential inter-stripe endogenic background emission. Our recent much lower estimate of emission from the tiger stripes alone, ~4.5 GW (Spencer et al. 2013), uses high-resolution long-wavelength data to exclude both passive and possible endogenic inter-stripe emission, but is based on poorly-constrained extrapolations to the entire system of long-wavelength observations of small portions of the tiger stripes. We eagerly await the one remaining opportunity to extend long-wavelength, high spatial resolution, mapping to more of the tiger stripe system in Cassini's final close Enceladus flyby, in December 2015. In the meantime, existing long-wavelength data of intermediate spatial resolution provides intriguing additional clues about the true spatial distribution, and thus the total power, of the long-wavelength emission. In particular, a March 2008 scan of Damascus and Baghdad Sulci shows surprisingly bright 16 - 200 micron emission at the anti-Saturn end of these tiger stripes, which may indicate excess endogenic power, either from the tiger stripes or the inter-stripe regions, that is not included in our 2013 heat flow estimate.",

            "abstract": "Arborturbation, or tree throw, the upheaval of soil and sometimes bedrock in the root mass of a fallen tree, has been suggested to be a major process in the overturn and downslope transport of soil and shallow bedrock in mountainous regions. Reported here is a quantification of the effects of tree throw from six sites in the eastern U.S. from New York to Alabama. The study included field measurements of individual tree throws within a 120-meter diameter search area centered on ridge tops on the Silurian Rose Hill Formation shale and coeval strata of similar composition. The following observations were made for each tree throw at each study site: GPS location, tree girth, relative tree age, tree type, dimensions of pit, azimuth of fall, and slope and azimuth of maximum slope. These observations allowed quantification of the volume and distance of transport of sediment per event, and the number of events/area/time. The sediment fluxes reported here range from 1.8 X 10-5 m2/m/y to 2.1 X 10-4 m2/m/y. The observations double in number and verify formulations of sediment flux due to tree throw cited in the literature., and exceed by several orders of magnitude values for sediment flux rate by soil creep on slopes. Slope and prevailing wind direction, while important in places, did not control the majority of arborturbation events in this study. The total number of tree throws is observed to decrease while sediment flux by tree throw generally increases from north to south along the study transect. Larger trees evacuate larger pits, but interestingly there is no observed increase in the average girth of trees in the study area to account for the discrepancy between number of tree throws and sediment flux. However, the depth to a root limiting layer and the distance from the center of a root wad to the center of an excavated pit increases from north to south – deeper roots excavate more soil and deeper soils generally exist in warmer climates.",

            "abstract": "Red tides are high-biomass blooms in the coastal ocean typically caused by dinoflagellates. While some red tides are harmful (via toxin production, high biomass, and oxygen depletion during decay), they also provide an important source of energy and carbon for other trophic levels. Red tides are often ephemeral, so while it is easy to identify one, what causes these events to terminate can vary. It has been hypothesized that viral lysis and parasitic infection may be important vectors of termination for these blooms. This study sought to compare the decay of one such bloom in Monterey Bay, California to in situ and mesocosm studies where bloom termination was due to viral lysis. To achieve this goal we used MODIS ocean color Level 2 data with spatial resolution of 1km; we identified and averaged RRS from 9 pixels within the northern \"red tide incubator” region of Monterey Bay where a dinoflagellate bloom was identified. We applied the quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) to derive the backscatter coefficient (bbp(λ)), absorption due to chlorophyll (aChl), and the gelbstoff absorption coefficient (ag). Separate equations were used to find the volume scattering function (β(ψ,λ) where ψ =140°) and the particle size distribution hyperbolic slope (ξ). A MODIS satellite time series of five days (during an eight-day period) confirmed optical changes similar to documented shifts in laboratory-controlled experiments examining viral lysis. As predicted from previous results, the decrease in chlorophyll – essentially the deterioration of the algal bloom – resulted in the anticipated decrease in bbp(λ) and VSF values as well as an increase in ξ. aChl and ag were also compared to the Morel 2009 band algorithm for Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) and the OC3 band algorithm for chlorophyll concentration. Results indicate that the QAA retrievals cannot be statistically distinguished (using a paired t-test) from the Morel and OC3 band algorithms. Analyzing more bloom events would refine this method’s results and would provide the potential to determine how a bloom is terminated – e.g. by viral lysis, parasitic infection, or nutrient depletion. This could in turn lead to a better understanding of bloom termination generally, perhaps leading to improved mitigation efforts for red tides and harmful algal blooms.",

            "abstract": "The production of belowground biomass plays an important role in the total carbon balance and net primary productivity (NPP) of an ecosystem. In particular, fine root biomass, due to rapid turnover rates, contributes a disproportionate amount of annual belowground net primary productivity (BNPP). The NEON Terrestrial Observation System will quantify above- and below-ground biomass at 60 sites distributed across 20 eco-climatic regions. Routine belowground observations include collecting fine root biomass samples to a maximum depth of 30 cm. Because substantial fine root biomass exists below 30 cm, NEON is also characterizing the distribution of fine root biomass with depth down to a maximum of 2 m below the surface in one excavated soil pit per site. The soil pit is dug in the site’s dominant vegetation, and samples are wet sieved to extract roots. In conjunction with physical and chemical properties analyzed within each soil horizon, the soil pit characterization dataset will provide valuable information about the distribution of belowground biomass as a function of depth, as well as differences in total belowground biomass across NEON’s 60 sites.\nHere, we analyzed differences in total belowground mass across sites, and we evaluated factors that may contribute to differences in total fine root biomass, such as precipitation, evapotranspiration, soil chemical and physical properties, and aboveground phenology. Soil pit characterization is complete at approximately 50% of sites, and the relatively large sample size allows us to test which factors best predict both the proportion of fine root biomass at depth, as well as total fine root biomass. These characterization data help inform development of NEON data products, and they also illustrate the scope of research possibilities that independent researchers may pursue with free-access to this novel, continental-scale dataset.",

            "abstract": "Historical occurrence of methane in residential water wells in parts of the Appalachian basin (Pennsylvania, New York, West Virginia) has long been recognized as a natural phenomenon. The recent increase in shale gas extraction activities in these areas has highlighted the need to distinguish between baseline methane concentrations and those that may results from gas extraction activities. For the first time, this study shows that natural dissolved methane in Northeastern Pennsylvania exhibits a relationship with prevailing redox conditions of groundwater, though this relationship is not entirely as predicted. Specifically, methane concentrations in 806 pre-drill samples from residential water wells in Susquehanna County, NE Pennsylvania, were found to be highest in samples with low SO4 concentrations but low Fe(II) concentrations. This is opposite from what would be expected if high methane concentrations were associated with a reduction of insoluble Fe(III)-minerals resulting in the release of soluble Fe(II) (and therefore, an increase in measurable dissolved iron). The water type (i.e., Na-rich vs. Ca-rich), and topographic location (i.e., valley vs. upland) was also evaluated for each of the prevailing redox states to identify associations and potential driving factors. Based on this information, this talk identifies a combination of easily identifiable natural environmental “risk” factors (i.e., advanced redox state, Na-rich water type, and valley setting) that are highly predictive of naturally elevated methane concentrations in water wells. These findings highlight simple and meaningful relationships that may be used to infer whether methane in residential water sources is natural or associated with stray gas migration.",

Isotopic fractionation in thermal gradients is an example of a system which is not fully understood but could provide background for understanding variations in fractionations like those observed for noble gases in terrestrial and extraterrestrial material. Using a recently developed molecular dynamics simulation focused on the accuracy of the simulated physics, the isotopic fractionation of Neon in a thermal gradient was analyzed in order to provide a correlation between the fractionation and the experimental system’s properties. Various ratios of isotopes 20Ne, 21Ne, and 22Ne were simulated in a thermal gradient ranging from 218 K to 233 K for a variety of time scales. Data was collected for various configurations including box sizes on the order of 1 nm to 100 μm. The simulated thermal conductivity was determined and compared with known values. The analysis indicates that the dimensions of the box heavily influence the magnitude of the isotopic fractionation in the thermal gradient.",

            "abstract": "Providing efficient and reliable model predictions for the partitioning of atmospheric aerosol components between different phases (gas, liquids, solids) is a challenging problem. The partitioning of water, various semivolatile organic components, inorganic acids, bases, and salts, depends simultaneously on the chemical properties and interaction effects among all constituents of a gas + aerosol system. The effects of hygroscopic particle growth on the water contents and physical states of potentially two or more liquid and/or solid aerosol phases in turn may significantly affect multiphase chemistry, the direct effect of aerosols on climate, and the ability of specific particles to act as cloud condensation or ice nuclei. Considering the presence of a liquid-liquid phase separation in aerosol particles, which typically leads to one phase being enriched in rather hydrophobic compounds and the other phase enriched in water and dissolved electrolytes, adds a high degree of complexity to the goal of predicting the gas-particle partitioning of all components. Coupled gas-particle partitioning and phase separation methods are required to correctly account for the phase behaviour of aerosols exposed to varying environmental conditions, such as changes to relative humidity. We present new theoretical insights and a substantially improved algorithm for the reliable prediction of gas-particle partitioning at thermodynamic equilibrium based on the Aerosol Inorganic-Organic Mixtures Functional groups Activity Coefficients (AIOMFAC) model. We introduce a new approach for the accurate prediction of the phase distribution of multiple inorganic ions between two liquid phases, constrained by charge balance, and the coupling of the liquid-liquid equilibrium model to a robust gas-particle partitioning algorithm. Such coupled models are useful for exploring the range of environmental conditions leading to complete or incomplete miscibility of aerosol constituents which will affect other particle properties, such as the viscosity of aerosol phases. The method has been applied successfully to the calculation of gas-liquid-liquid-solid equilibria used for the prediction of aerosol hygroscopicity (humidity cycles) in comparison to laboratory experiments on aerosol water uptake and phase behaviour.",

Seismic reflection profiles bound on the south by the transpressional North Altyn Fault (NAF) and on the north by the strike-slip dominated transpressional Cherchen Fault, obtained in a grid of 20 km-spaced parallel and 10 km-spaced perpendicular lines to these two major structures. Among the major features apparent on the seismic sections are: 1) a southwest-northeast trending anticline bound on the north by a minor reverse fault, 2) a basal Cenozoic angular unconformity evident as a major reflective horizon and confirmed with borehole data from the RC1 well, also verifying the thickness of Cenozoic aged sediments at <3500 m throughout SE Tarim, 3) minor reverse faults with minimal (< 500 m) cumulative vertical offset in early Cenozoic strata, 4) depth to crystalline basement of ~3500 m, evident from the lack of seismic horizons (reflections) below Jurassic aged strata. Though identifiable structures are few within SE Tarim, reconstructions of the structures shown in seismic sections indicate that a maximum of 1.5 km of crustal shortening has occurred in the southeast Tarim Basin throughout the Cenozoic, less than that necessary for a major thrust system. Quantifying this shortening helps to characterize the deformation within the footwall block of the NAF, constraining the maximum vertical component of offset on the NAF as less than the maximum vertical thickness of Cenozoic sediments in SE Tarim of ~3500 m, observations that suggest minimal vertical offset (<3 km) on the NAF. 1 Seismic section that extends north of the Cherchen Fault shows that the pattern of minimal deformation in SE Tarim extends north of this major structure, further solidifying the results showing minimal deformation within the Tarim Basin.",

            "abstract": "With the advent of the Critical Zone Observatory Network, new opportunities are emerging to link the geological and ecological aspects of environmental science. Interactions between the CZO Network and the 30-year old Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network can provide the opportunity to interpret long-term ecological research in the context of the geologic forces that have shaped both the form and function of the landscape. Using four examples from the Luquillo Mountains in tropical Puerto Rico, I highlight the ways in which ecological patterns and processes are driven by the underlying geologic template. The distribution of stream biota in the Luquillo Mountains is striking, with predatory fish below large geomorphic breaks; above these waterfalls, fish are absent, and shrimp dominate the biota. The critical zone thus structures aquatic communities. A second example is provided by the role of soil texture and structure in driving rates of greenhouse gas production. In the moderately well drained soils of the Luquillo Mountains, water-filled pore space is a key driver of methane production. Critical zone characteristics thus shape biotic function and ecosystem carbon balance. A third example is the effect of riparian zone structure on watershed-scale nitrogen losses. Due to differences in the geomorphology of the riparian zone on volcaniclastic and intrusive bedrock, adjacent watersheds have remarkably different patterns in stream nitrate following hurricanes. Nitrogen losses from these watersheds are driven by interactions between biology and lithology that affect riparian zone function. Finally, in the deep critical zone (5 m) bacterial growth is dominated by autotrophic iron-oxidizing bacteria, with implications for weathering, the development of flow pathways, and solute transport. In this case, biota may be driving the formation of the critical zone through biotic effects on weathering. In each example, our ability to understand the importance of critical zone processes is enhanced by the broad ecological context provided by LTER research. With the anticipated inauguration of NEON observatories in the next several years, a whole new set of opportunities will arise to establish links between the critical zone and ecological processes across North America.",

Their purpose is to enable the science team to establish the geological context of the landing site area, to assess whether past or present environments could support microbial life, to search for potential biosignatures, and to use this information to identify samples for caching. To prepare for future human exploration, the payload includes the ability for in situ resource utilization, converting CO2 to O2, the ability to assess physical characteristics of the dust, and environmental monitoring of the temperature, pressure, humidity, wind, and radiation. The Mars 2020 mission will pave a significant portion of the path to Mars for scientific understanding and future human exploration. We will detail the mission's scientific and exploration technology objectives and the payload assembled to accomplish these goals.",

            "abstract": " Recent measurements in the Amazon suggest that the flow of CO2 in surface waters may reach the order of 1GT per year and isotopic analyzes suggest that this carbon is a direct result of organic matter degradation (OMD) in rivers and the measured concentration exceeds the value expected for there to be equilibrium with the atmosphere (Richey et al, 2002). This study aimed to measure and check the seasonal variability of CO2 fluxes in a range of six months (September 2013-February 2014) in the Strait Óbidos hydrological station located geographically in the coordinates 55 ° 1 '4 \"S and 55 ° 31' 4\" W. In addiction, it is intended to correlate the data with physical-chemical water parameters pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and temperature and humidity. The method used for the measurement of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere-water interface is the floating chamber liked with an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA- Infrared Gas Analyzer). The physical-chemical parameters of water were measured using a multiparameter probe YSI Professional Plus model. The preliminary results shows values average CO2 flux was approximately 15.65 1,01ppm / m2s-1 for the months of September and October and between the months of November, 2013 and February 2014 the CO2 flux average was 4.40 + 1.94 ppm / m2s-1. In addiction to the high temperature in dry season, in the water column there is sufficient convection for the existence of gases transport from water to atmosphere, resulting in increase of exchange. Thus, the decreased amount of radiation and consequently the low temperatures in the humid period (on average 27.2 ° C) should affect the OMD in the river, responsible for the production of dissolved CO2.\nKeywords: CO2 flux, seasonal variability, amazon river",

            "abstract": "The current use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers in agriculture has many negative environmental and economic costs, necessitating improved nitrogen management. In the highly heterogeneous landscape of the Palouse region in eastern Washington and northern Idaho, crop nitrogen needs vary widely within a field. Site-specific nitrogen management is a promising strategy to reduce excess nitrogen lost to the environment while maintaining current yields by matching crop needs with inputs. This study used in-situ hydrologic, nutrient, and crop yield data from a heavily instrumented field site in the high precipitation zone of the wheat-producing Palouse region to assess the performance of the MicroBasin model. MicroBasin is a high-resolution watershed-scale ecohydrologic model with nutrient cycling and cropping algorithms based on the CropSyst model. Detailed soil mapping conducted at the site was used to parameterize the model and the model outputs were evaluated with observed measurements. The calibrated MicroBasin model was then used to evaluate the impact of various nitrogen management strategies on crop yield and nitrate losses. The strategies include uniform application as well as delineating the field into multiple zones of varying nitrogen fertilizer rates to optimize nitrogen use efficiency. We present how coupled modeling and in-situ data sets can inform agricultural management and policy to encourage improved nitrogen management.",

            "abstract": "Suborbital astronomical observations have over 50 years' history using NASA's sounding rockets and experimental space planes. The new commercial space industry is developing suborbital reusable launch vehicles (sRLV’s) to provide low-cost, flexible, and frequent access to space at ~100 km altitude. In the case of XCOR Aerospace’s Lynx spacecraft, the vehicle design and capabilities work well for hosting specially designed experiments that can be flown with a human-tended researcher or alone with the pilot on a customized mission. Some of the first-generation instruments and facilities that will conduct solar observations on dedicated Lynx science missions include the SwRI Solar Instrument Pointing Platform (SSIPP) and Atsa Suborbital Observatory, as well as KickSat sprites, which are picosatellites for in situ atmospheric and solar phenomena measurements. The SSIPP is a demonstration two-stage pointed solar observatory that operates inside the Lynx cockpit. The coarse pointing stage includes the pilot in the feedback loop, and the fine stage stabilizes the solar image to achieve arcsecond class pointing. SSIPP is a stepping-stone to future external instruments that can operate with larger apertures and shorter wavelengths in the solar atmosphere. The Planetary Science Institute’s Atsa Suborbital Observatory combines the strengths of ground-based observatories and space-based observing to create a facility where a telescope is maintained and used interchangeably with either in-house facility instruments or user-provided instruments. The Atsa prototype is a proof of concept, hand-guided camera that mounts on the interior of the Lynx cockpit to test target acquisition and tracking for human-operated suborbital astronomy. KickSat sprites are mass-producible, one inch printed circuit boards (PCBs) populated by programmable off the shelf microprocessors and radios for real time data transmission. The sprite PCBs can integrate chip-based radiometers, magnetometers, accelerometers, etc. This low-cost, customizable platform provides researchers the ability to design immediately responsive, repeatable, high resolution experiments.",

            "abstract": "Frequent estimation of heat flux in active hydrothermal areas are required to monitor the variation in activity. Natural changes in geothermal and hydrothermal features can include rapid significant changes in surface temperature distribution and may be an indication of “re-plumbing” of the systems or potential hydrothermal explosions. Frequent monitoring of these systems can help Park managers make informed decisions on infrastructure development and/or take precautionary actions to protect the public.\nNorris Geyser Basin (NGB) is one of Yellowstone National Park’s hottest and most dynamic basins. Airborne high-resolution thermal infrared remote sensing was used to estimate radiometric temperatures within NGB and allow for the estimation of the spatial and temporal distribution of surface temperatures and the heat flow budget. The airborne monitoring occurred in consecutive years 2008-2012 allowing for the temporal comparison of heat budget in NGB. Airborne thermal infrared images in the 8-12 µm bands with 1-m resolution were acquired using a FLIR SC640 scanner. Digital multispectral images in the green (0.57 µm), red (0.65 µm), and near infrared (0.80 µm) bands were also acquired to classify the terrain cover and support the atmospheric and emissivity correction of the thermal images.\nThe airborne images were taken in the month of September on selected days with similar weather and under clear sky conditions. In the winter of 2012, images were also taken in March to compare the effect of the cold weather and snow cover on the heat budget. Consistent methods were used to acquire and process the images each year to limit the potential variability in the results to only the variability in the hydrothermal system. Data from radiation flux towers installed within the basin were used to compare with airborne radiometric surface temperatures and compensate for residual solar heating in the imagery.\nThe presentation will discuss the different mechanisms involved in determining the heat budget i.e. convection heat, radiation heat, and latent heat through the evaporation of water and show preliminary estimates of heat fluxes for the entire basin.",

            "abstract": "Ammonia (NH3) is the dominant alkaline species in the atmosphere and an important compound in the global nitrogen cycle. There is a large uncertainty in NH3 emission inventory from agriculture, which is the largest source of NH3, including livestock farming and fertilizer applications. In recent years, a quantum cascade laser (QCL)-based open-path sensor has been developed to provide high-resolution, fast-response and high-sensitivity NH3 measurements. It has a detection limit of 150 pptv with a sample rate up to 20 Hz. This sensor has been integrated into a mobile platform mounted on the roof of a car to perform measurement of multiple trace gases. We have also used the sensor for eddy covariance (EC) flux measurements. The mobile sensing method provides high spatial resolution and fast mapping of measured gases. Meanwhile, the EC flux method offers accurate flux measurements and resolves the diurnal variability of NH3emissions.\nDuring the DISCOVER-AQ and FRAPPÉ field campaigns in 2014, this mobile platform was used to study NH3 emissions from cattle feedlot near Fort Morgan, Colorado. This specific feedlot was mapped multiple times in different days to study the variability of its plume characteristics. At the same time, we set up another open-path NH3 sensor with LICOR open-path sensors to perform EC flux measurements of NH3, CH4 and CO2 simultaneously in the same cattle feedlot as shown in Fig. 1. NH3/CH4 emission flux ratio show a strong temperature dependence from EC flux measurements. The median value of measured NH3 and CH4 emission flux ratio is 0.60 ppmv/ppmv. In contrast, the median value of ΔNH3/ΔCH4 ratios measured from mobile platform is 0.53 ppmv/ppmv for the same farm. The combination of mobile mapping and EC flux measurements with the same open-path sensors greatly improves understanding of NH3 emissions both spatially and temporally.",

The aim of this study was to: 1) test the important ecological drivers for N2-fixation, 2) investigate seasonal and temporal patterns of N2 fixation, and 3) to estimate current N2-fixation rates at Mer Bleue bog.\nWe used acetylene reduction assay (ARA) to measure N2-fixation from June-October 2013 and 2014 (currently ongoing field season) along a hydrological gradient (beaver pond, hollows and hummocks). The highest ARA rates in 2013 growing season occurred in the pond in floating Sphagnum cuspidatum mats (50.3 ± 12.9 μmol m-2 d-1 Mean ± Std Err) which were up to 2.5 times latger than the rates found in the hummock with the lowest water table depth throughout the season. Two rain events during the summer 2013 increased ARA rates in all plots by 1 to 4 times, suggesting that moisture availability may play a crucial role on N2 fixation potential in the field. We are currently investigating the role of moisture, temperature, PAR and nutrient content (N, phosphorous and metals) on ARA along the gradient.

            "abstract": "The character and timing of voluminous Miocene volcanic activity associated with regional crustal extension in the lower Colorado River Extensional Corridor (CREC) shed light on the interplay between tectonic and magmatic processes in the area. New 40Ar/39Ar ages from holocrystaline groundmass separates of mafic lava flows and phenocrystic plagioclase, biotite, hornblende, and sanidine from silicic extrusive rocks, combined with LA-ICPMS U-Pb ages of zircon from the more altered intermediate to silicic rocks provide important new constraints on the ages of pre-, syn-, and post-extensional volcanic sequences in the vicinity of the Whipple Mountains metamorphic core complex. Local eruptive activity began ~20.5 Ma and persisted for 1.5 million years prior to the inception of major extensional faulting and tilting at ~19 Ma, as recorded by upper plate tilt blocks. The pre-extensional sequences are homoclinal, steeply tilted, and disconformably overlie older arkosic sedimentary rocks. There is no compelling evidence for angular unconformities or growth faulting during this earliest pre-extensional volcanic activity. These early erupted units are dominantly mafic, forming ≥1 km thick sections of olivine-basalt and olv-cpx-plag basaltic andesite lava flows punctuated by rare aphyric to crystal poor dacite ignimbrites. Plag±pyx±bio±hbl dacite lava flows and domes with associated pyroclastic deposits appear late in the pre-extensional sequence, immediately prior to and during the onset of major extensional faulting. These crystal-poor to aphyric silicic rocks show abundant evidence of magma mingling and may represent hybridized partial melts generated by the influx of basaltic magma into the crust. The pre-extensional sequence is locally overlain by ~18.5 to 18.8 Ma syn- and post-extensional volcanic and sedimentary rocks along a pronounced 30-60° angular unconformity, indicating very rapid extension during the early stages of the CREC's development. This overall evolution of magmatism immediately prior to inception of rapid, large-scale crustal extension is compatible with an “active rifting” model, wherein sustained input of mantle derived basaltic melts led to thermal weakening of the crust, enhanced crustal melting, and triggered extensional collapse.",

Creating high resolution paleoclimate records for these areas aids in determining the intensity and cyclicity of possible future climate extremes. This study presents a high-resolution, isotopic hydroclimatological analysis of Barbados’ rainfall and groundwater in relation to atmospheric influences during storms. Through this calibration of interannual precipitation variability under a modern climatic regime, we can better understand the climatic influences driving our interpretation of paleoclimate reconstructions from speleothems. Weekly samples of dripwater, rainfall, groundwater, and 10-minute precipitation amounts were collected from July, 2012 to October, 2013 at Harrison’s Cave in Barbados. These samples underwent isotopic analysis for oxygen and deuterium isotopes. Weekly to monthly rainfall totals were compiled from Harrison’s Cave and several island wide stations. In addition, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite data were used to compare against oxygen isotope values to provide a multiproxy approach at reconstructing rainfall variability used in the calibration model. At a weekly resolution, the amount effect is not represented at the study site; however, using weather station and remotely sensed data, at an island wide scale the amount effect signal is strongest at monthly timescales. TRMM data accurately reflect the influence of the amount effect at this resolution, thus providing the possibility of a new proxy for rainfall amount when calibrating speleothem paleoclimate records. The amount-weighted precipitation and groundwater values indicate homogenization of the aquifer indicate speleothem record changes in interannual variability. When compared to data from previous studies, the average annual dripwater oxygen isotope values are the same (­–3‰), thereby indicating minimal changes in the climatic environment over a decadal scale. When applied to speleothem climate reconstructions, using high resolution, modern multiproxy calibration techniques can aid in interpreting the paleoclimate record.",

            "abstract": "We have developed real-time buoy system for tsunami and crustal movement since 2012. Our motivations are needs of the crustal movement data of not only for vertical component but horizontal, real-time data transmission for future prediction of the next large earthquake, and needs of relatively easily system comparing with the seafloor cable network system. Therefore, we are developing the above system using a buoy system, considering long term observation of approximately two years. Our system’s characteristics are real-time observation, separation between tsunami and crustal movement, mobility, and environmental compatibility. Tsunami and crustal movement data are sent with intervals of an hour and a week respectively in real-time, and we can also get them on-demand via satellite transmission from the land station. We are going to observe tsunami using a pressure sensor and a PPP (precise point positioning) navigation system on the buoy, therefore, tsunami and vertical crustal deformation are separated in real-time. And the horizontal component of the crustal deformation is also measured by acoustic signals between the buoy and six seafloor transponders. Our system can be used under severe strong sea current with a speed of 5.5 knots due to adaption of slack mooring. Therefore, we can deploy it without consideration of sea current. In addition, the geometry including the size of the buoy, lengths of some ropes, and capacity of the electric battery and so on is tuned considering an environment of deployment location. Through twice sea trials, we are confirming each function. In this presentation, we introduce the outline and results of the sea trials.",

            "abstract": "Louisiana has the highest rates of coastal wetland loss in the United States. In addition to being lost, Louisiana wetlands experience numerous other environmental stressors including changes in salinity regime (both increases from salt water intrusion and decreases from the creation of river diversions) and climate change induced changes in vegetation (e.g. the northward expansion of Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) into salt marshes). In this study, we examined how these changes might influence biogeochemical process rates important in regulating carbon balance and the cycling, retention, and removal of nutrients in Louisiana wetlands. Specifically, we measured net soil greenhouse gas fluxes and collected cores for the determination of rates of greenhouse gas production, denitrification potential, nitrification potential, iron reduction, and phosphorus sorption from surface (0-5cm) and subsurface (10-15cm) depths for three plots in each of 4 sites along the salinity gradient: a freshwater marsh site, a brackish (7 ppt) marsh site, a salt marsh (17 ppt), and a Avicennia germinans stand (17 ppt; adjacent to salt marsh site) in the Barataria Bay estuarine system. Most biogeochemical processes displayed similar spatial patterns with salt marsh rates being lower than rates in freshwater and/or brackish marsh sites and not having significantly different rates than in Avicennia germinans stands. Rates in surface soils were generally higher than in subsurface soils. These patterns were generally consistent with spatial patterns in soil properties with soil water content, organic matter quantity and quality, and extractable nutrients generally being higher in freshwater and brackish marsh sites than salt marsh and Avicennia germinans sites, especially in surface soils. These spatial patterns suggest that the ability of coastal wetlands to retain and remove nutrients might change significantly in response to future climate changes in the region and that these alterations to biogeochemical cycling capacity need to be considering when designing and managing future restoration projects especially those involving river diversions.",

            "abstract": "We are investigating the paleoseismic history of northern Washington using offshore turbidite cores and lake sediments collected from forearc lakes along a transect from offshore to Seattle, Washington. Additional offshore cores, ash determinations and heavy mineral analysis flesh out the turbidite stratigraphy off northern Washington, and support 3-5 proximal turbidites in northern Washington canyons (see Adams, 1990) in addition to the 19 regionally correlated beds. Onshore, we have cored multiple lakes including (west to east) Beaver, Leland, Tarboo, Hall, Sawyer, and Wapato, east of the Cascades, and collected multibeam bathymetry, backscatter and chirp subbottom data. These lakes are small (2-113 ha), 6-18 m deep, and are all kettle lakes except Beaver Lake (landslide-dammed) and Wapato Lake, a glacial scour. These lakes were selected for their limited outside sediment sources and low sensitivity to ground shaking. The sedimentology is mostly organic-rich gyttja. All lakes contain the Mazama ash based on its similar depth occurrence in previously published cores and new EMP analysis. Computed Tomography (CT) density, gamma density, and magnetic susceptibility (ms) data show there is more stratigraphic variability than is visually apparent. Low-energy disturbance events are apparent in the stratigraphy of all lakes (except Hall) as increases in clastics, density, and ms. The number of post Mazama disturbance events is similar to the number of expected great earthquakes found offshore and onshore, though definition of the boundaries of the lake events is much less clear. Initial radiocarbon results and preliminary correlations along this 185 km transect show strong similarities in stratigraphic records between these cores over the past ~7600 years, anchored by the Mazama tephra. Preliminary comparisons with offshore cores show a striking similarity in downcore variability in physical properties. Given the evidence for earthquake origin for the offshore cores, and the strong common signal across the lake transect, we suggest that the lake disturbance events are likely of earthquake origin, representing turbidites generated internally within each lake. Analysis continues with the goal of estimating slope stability and minimum levels of ground shaking required to destabilize lake margins.",

For the determination of the environmental signature proceeded to characterize the water through 11 physicochemical parameters: temperature (T), potential hydrogen (pH), dissolved oxygen (DO), spectral absorption coefficient (SAC), the reduction of oxide potential (ORP), turbidity (Turb), conductivity (l), biochemical oxygen demand in 5 days (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS) and total dissolved solids (TDS ), which were evaluated in 49 sites in the dry season, 47 for the rainy season and 23 for the winter season in the basin and Atoyac Zahuapan Alto Atoyac, Puebla-Tlaxcala, Mexico river; finding a mathematical algorithm to assimilate and better represent the information obtained. The algorithm allows us to estimate correlation greater than 0.85. The results allow us to propose the algorithm used in the monitoring stations for purposes of processing information assimilated form.This measurement and monitoring of water quality supports the project, the monitoring network in real time and the actions to clean up Atoyac River, in the urban area of the city of Puebla.",

Scientists on both sides lobbied for a guiding principle in the design of planetary missions that included how to prevent biological contamination of target planetary bodies to preserve their pristine nature until they could be studied in detail. Planetary protection policies today remain as relevant because the pace of exploration has been far slower than their expectation, which was to have completed the search for life in our solar system within 50 years. Today Planetary Protection Policy rides on our definitions of terran life and what we know of its limits on Earth and our limited knowledge of extraterrestrial environments.\nA brief history of planetary protection is presented with a reminder that the harmful contamination it protects against for Mars is the inability to detect biosignatures should they exist. For illustration, an imaginary life detection mission without planetary protection requirements is discussed.

            "abstract": "The mechanisms of continental crust production and evolution in the early Earth remain controversial, as are questions of the relative roles of early differentiation versus subsequent tectonic procssing in creating Earth’s chemical signatures. Here we present geologic observations integrated with whole rock major, trace element and Sm-Nd isotopic signatures and combined with U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotopic compositions of zircon populations from the same rocks, from the most extensive early rock record comprising the 3.9 Ga to 3.6 Ga terranes of southwest Greenland. These data reveal repeated patterns of formation of juvenile TTG crust and associated mafic and ultramafic rocks in convergent margin settings followed by formation of more evolved granites [1]. Our new zircon Lu-Hf data from rare 3.6-3.7 Ga tonalites within the Itsaq Gneiss Complex, obtained from single component, non-migmatitic gneisses with simple zircon populations, limited within sample Hf isotopic variability and accurate U-Pb ages, now document extraction of juvenile tonalites from a near chondritic mantle source between 3.9 Ga and 3.6 Ga. The more evolved, granitic rocks in each area show slightly negative initial εHf in accord with crustal reworking of the older (3.8-3.9 Ga) gniesses. There is no evidence for Hadean material in the sources of the granitoids. The Hf isotope-time patterns are consistent with juvenile crust production from a mantle source that experienced only modest amounts of prior crustal extraction. They are distinct from those predicted by reprocessing of an enriched Hadean mafic crust, as has been proposed for this region [2] and for the source of the Hadean Jack Hills zircons [3]. The well-documented, time decreasing, positive 142Nd anomalies [e.g., 4] from these rocks are further evidence of crustal derivation from a convecting mantle source, rather than reworking of an enriched mafic lithosphere. The 143Nd isotopic –time patterns are more complex, reflecting the interplay between early Sm/Nd fractionation processes as required by the 142Nd data, juvenile crustal growth and in some cases geologic disturbance of the whole rock Sm-Nd system.\n[1] Nutman, et al, (2013) Amer.

Biogenic terpenoid emission inventories have been often assessed on a global basis and consistently available on model grid system units to support climate and chemical transport modeling. However, little of these have been assessed based on the political units such as countries and provinces. On the basis of political boundaries in Asia, we assembled and compared a large number of terpenoid emission estimates including currently published or reported sources. We assessed these terpenoid emission estimates in the context of the spatial and temporal consistency. Since the biogenic terpenoid emission inventories commonly use leaf biomass density, solar radiation and temperature as driving variables, we used the MODIS Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) datasets as surrogates to correlate with the terpenoid emission estimates in Asia. Based on our current assessment, we will discuss about the current status of the biogenic terpenoid emission inventories in Asia.",

            "abstract": "West Iberian Margin is known as an upwelling area caused by strong trade wind in late spring and summer. Also, the Azores Front (AF), in which upwelling locally occur, resides south of the Gulf of Cadiz in the present, and presumably penetrated to the Gulf of Cadiz with enhanced upwelling during the glacial period (Rogerson et al., 2004). Therefore, primary production in surface waters of West Iberian Margin and Gulf of Cadiz could sensitively vary against paleocenographic and paeloclimatic changes. Moreover, these areas are located directly outside of the Strait of Gibraltar, and influence the Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW). In the present study, we investigate marine algal biomarkers including long chain alkenones (haptophyte origin) and diols (diatom and eustigmatophyte origin), and dinosteroids (dinoflagellate origin) in the sediment cores from the Gulf of Cadiz (IODP site U1387; 5.5-3.0 Ma) and west of the Iberian Margin (IODP site U1391; 3.5-1.3 Ma) for reconstructing variations in marine primary production from the latest Miocene to mid Pleistocene.\nIn studied samples, we mainly detected marine algal C28 and C30 1,13-diols, 1,14-diols and 1,15-diols. Our results in the samples from the Gulf of Cadiz show elevated values in the diol index (DI; upwelling intensity proxy; Rampen et al., 2008) and higher concentration of dinosterol around 3.3 Ma. These results indicate high production around 3.3 Ma. The DI values in the sediments of West Iberian Margin were low during 3.5-2.1 Ma but increased after 2.1 Ma, indicating enhanced coastal upwelling. The timing of increasing production in Gulf of Cadiz (3.3 Ma) is similar to that of global cooling as the MIS M2. Naafs et al. (2010) suggested development of glacial-like surface circulation in the North Atlantic during this period. Thus, we interpret that high production during 3.3 Ma in the Gulf of Cadiz was associated with the AF penetration into the gulf. While, MOW circulation system at the present-day might have been established since 2.1 Ma (Hernadez-Molina et al., 2014), when major glaciation was expanded (Rohling et al., 2014). Hence, high DI trends after 2.1 Ma imply the ocean circulation change caused by the establishment of present MOW system, and/or global change of ocean / wind circulation related to glaciation.",

Analytical, semi-analytical, experimental and numerical studies on idealized wedges have provided insight into the seismic behavior of continental margins, mountain roots and crustal discontinuities. Published results, however, have almost exclusively focused on incident Rayleigh waves and out-of-plane body (SH) waves. Complementing the existing body of work, we here present results from our study on the res­ponse of elastic wedges to incident P or SV waves, an idealized pro­blem that can provide valuable insight to the understanding and parameterization of topographic ampli­fication of seismic ground mo­tion. We first show our earlier work on explicit finite difference simulations of SV-wave scattering by elastic wedges over a wide range of internal angles. We next present a semi-analytical solution that we developed using the approach proposed by Gautesen, to describe the scattered wavefield in the immediate vicinity of the wedge’s tip (near-field). We use the semi-analytical solution to validate the numerical analyses, and improve resolution of the amplification factor at the wedge vertex that spikes when the internal wedge angle approaches the critical angle of incidence.",

            "abstract": "We demonstrate how field measurements can inform the selection of model frameworks in small watershed applications. Based on the assumption that ecohydrological systems are open and complex, we employ the process network analysis to identify the system state and the subsystems architecture with changing environment conditions. Ecohydrological and biogeochemical processes in a watershed can be viewed as a network of processes of a wide range of scales involving various feedback loops and time delay. Using the KoFlux tower-based measurements of energy, water and CO2 flux time series along with those representing the soil-plant-atmospheric continuum; we evaluated statistical measures of characterizing the organization of the information flows in the system. We used Shannon’s information entropy and calculated the mutual information and transfer entropy, following Ruddell and Kumar (2009). Transfer entropy can measure the relative strength and time scale of couplings between the variables. In this analysis, we selected 15 variables associated with ecohydrological processes, which are groundwater table height, water temperature, specific conductivity, soil moisture contents at three depths, ecosystem respiration, gross primary productivity, sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, precipitation, air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, atmospheric pressure, and solar radiation. The data-driven nature of this investigation may shed a light on reconciling model parsimony with equifinality in small watershed applications.

            "abstract": "We assess the stationarity of the relationship between Northern Hemisphere winter (Dec-Feb) sea-level pressure (SLP) and proxy time series (major ions, accumulation, and stable isotopes) from the Eclipse (3017 m asl) and the Mt. Logan Prospector-Russell Col (PRCol; 5340 m asl) ice cores from Yukon, Canada. We develop a novel spatial calibration procedure to identify ranges of ice core values that are associated with consistent winter SLP anomaly patterns. Each ice core variable time series was ranked and divided into groups of 13 years each. We assess stationarity by splitting the 1872-2001 analysis period in half (1872-1936 and 1937-2001) and comparing the locations and magnitudes of SLP anomaly patterns during the two periods for each group of ice core values. Northern Hemisphere monthly mean SLP from the 20th Century Reanalysis dataset are used. The high accumulation rate (1.38 m a-1) at Eclipse allows us to analyze 6-month seasonal mean values (Oct-Mar and Apr-Sep), whereas annual mean values are used from PRCol where the accumulation rate is lower (0.40 m a-1).\nThe Eclipse cold season accumulation and PRCol annual mean sodium concentrations (Na+) exhibit the strongest correlations with winter SLP anomaly patterns. In particular, the lowest and highest 20% annual Na+ values at PRCol and lowest 10% cold season accumulation values at Eclipse exhibit stationarity with consistent SLP anomaly patterns in the North Pacific for all three time periods. A weaker Aleutian Low consistently occurred in the central to eastern North Pacific for the lowest Na+ years at PRCol and lowest accumulation cold seasons at Eclipse, although these groups of years are mostly independent. A stronger Aleutian Low occurs in the North Pacific for the highest Na+ years at PRCol. A stationary SLP anomaly pattern is not observed through all three time periods for high cold season accumulation at Eclipse. Application of this calibration procedure with other traditional calibration and reconstruction methods can help identify the proxy values that are most likely to produce an accurate climate reconstruction. This study highlights an application where incorporating more SLP observations into the pre-1930 period of the 20th Century Reanalysis can improve the fidelity of climate proxy calibrations and paleoclimate reconstructions.",

            "abstract": "Welded basaltic ignimbrites are one of the rarest forms of ignimbrites found on Earth and can often have characteristics that are indistinguishable from those of basaltic lava flows. This study evaluates a basaltic volcanic flow in a coastal cliff sequence in Raupo Bay, Akaroa Volcanic Complex, Banks Peninsula, New Zealand. The Raupo Bay coastal cliff sequence is comprised of 4 units, termed L1, L2, L3, and A, capped by loess. L1 and L2 are basaltic lavas, L3 proximal scoria deposits, which thin inland, and Unit A, a flow with unusual characteristics, which is the focus of this study. Field mapping, sampling, geochemical analysis and petrology were utilized to characterize units. Further detailed structural analysis of Unit A was completed, to determine the nature of the basal contact, variations in welding throughout the unit and the relationship of the layer to the underlying topography. From these analyses it was found: Unit A is thickest in a paleo-valley and thins and mantles higher topography, welding in the unit increases downwards forming topographic controlled columnar jointing, the top of the unit is brecciated and grades into the lower welded/jointed portion, the basal contact is sharp overlying a regional airfall deposit, the unit has a notably distinct geochemical composition from the underlying stratigraphic units, Unit A contains flattened and sheared scoria clasts, has aligned bubbles, and lava lithics. Further thin section analysis of Unit A identified flattened clast boundaries and microlite rimming around phenocrysts. In comparing these features to previous studies on basaltic lavas and ignimbrites it is hypothesized that Unit A is a welded basaltic ignimbrite that was channelized by paleo-topography on the outer flanks of the Akaroa Volcanic Complex. This study furthers the characterization of basaltic ignimbrites and is the first to recognize basaltic ignimbrites within the Akaroa Volcanic Complex.",

            "abstract": "Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) is a rapid and non-destructive technique used to study rock fabrics. As part of a larger study, we analyzed the AMS for a number of relatively oriented cores collected in the Gulf of Papua. We collected continuous, discrete samples from six pairs of jumbo piston cores (up to 9 meters in length) and their companion trigger cores to use for our study. The trigger cores, which are just gravity cores, show a fabric with a near vertical minimum susceptibility axis and a degree of anisotropy that increases down core. The jumbo piston cores also display the near vertical minimum axis throughout, but the upper portions have a degree of anisotropy that decreases with depth. We attribute this effect, which can be seen up to two meters down core, to the piston coring process, and suggest that AMS be measured when studying sediment cores as a means of identifying portions of the core that have been affected by the collection process. Additionally, we examine the down core variability in AMS data, as well as variability between sets of cores and its relation to sedimentation in the Gulf of Papua.",

            "abstract": "Stormwater Detention Areas (SDAs) in agricultural landscapes are considered to be the most important Best Management Practice by state agencies in Florida. Two main processes responsible for Phosphorus (P) retention in SDAs are soil adsorption and plant uptake. Long term pumping of agricultural drainage may saturate the SDA’s soil with P which can put these systems at the risk of becoming a source of P. Given that these systems already occupy part of the farmland and are costly to build, interventions are needed to sustain SDAs as a sink of P. Soil and vegetation P content at two SDAs (SDA1 and 2) in south Florida was quantified in addition to inflow and outflow P loads. Analyses showed that soil was saturated with limited to no P adsorption capacity remaining. Negative Soil Phosphorus Storage Capacity (SPSC) indicated that soil was at a risk of P release. Given these conditions, the only avenue to remove P from SDAs without any potentially undesirable ecological impacts, was biomass harvesting. At SDA1, results showed that harvesting the aboveground biomass would result in 19% extra P retention if the current vegetation (Para grass, Brachiaria mutica) is harvested. Given that aboveground tissue P content of Para grass is very low, replacing it with another native grass (Maidencane, Panicum hemitomon) and harvesting it annually could retain most of the incoming P load. A similar analysis showed that at SDA2, almost 40% additional P could be retained by harvesting aboveground biomass of the dominant vegetation (Torpedo Grass, Panicum repens and Smartweed, Polygonum hydropiperoides). A spatial analysis in conjunction with SPSC values and aboveground plant P indicated that biomass harvesting can transform both the SDAs from a source to sink in 2 to 3 years. A fifty year net present value analysis showed that overall it is an economically feasible strategy with an average annual benefit of $3,223 and $34,825 for SDA1 and 2, respectively. Harvesting aboveground biomass has the potential to become a part of “payment for environmental services” program and is one of the less intensive methods to sustain SDAs as a net sink of P in the long-term without causing detrimental effects to the downstream ecology.",

            "abstract": "The Indonesian Throughflow (ITF), the only pathway for interocean exchange between the Pacific to the Indian Ocean, plays an important role in global ocean circulation and climate. Yet, continuous ITF measurement is difficult and expensive. We demonstrate a plausible approach to derive the ITF transport proxy using satellite altimetry sea surface height (SSH), gravimetry ocean bottom pressure (OBP) data, in situ measurements from the Makassar Strait from 1996-1998 and 2004-2009, and a theoretical formulation. We first identified the optimal locations in the Pacific and Indian Ocean based on the optimal correlation between the ITF transport through the Makassar Strait and the pressure gradients, represented by the SSH and OBP differences between the Pacific and Indian Oceans at a 1° x 1° horizontal resolution. These geographical locations (centred at off-equatorial in the western Pacific Ocean and centred at along the equator in the eastern Indian Ocean) that control the strength and variability of the ITF transport in the Makassar Strait differ from early studies. The proxy time series follow the observation time series quite well, resolving the intraseasonal, monsoonal, and interannual signals with the 1993-2011 annual mean proxy transport of 11.6 ± 3.2 Sv. Our formulation provides a continuous approach to derive the ITF proxy as long as the satellite data are available. Such a continuous record would be difficult to achieve by in situ measurements alone due to logistical and financial challenges. Ideally, the proxy can be used to complement or fill in the gaps of the observations for a continuous ITF proxy for better understanding the ocean climate and validating ocean circulation models.",

The broad spatial coverage and continuous time series of observations allow for a careful investigation of changes in internal wave energy during a decade when sea-ice extent and thickness decreased dramatically. Near-inertial internal waves are generally most energetic in summer during sea-ice retreat, with a second peak in early winter during the period of maximum wind velocity. This seasonal variability matches the seasonal cycle in `wind factor’, which connects sea-ice drift velocity to wind velocity. The wind factor is related to the ratio of air to water drag coefficients, and is shown to vary with sea-ice extent. An increasing inter-annual trend in near-inertial wave energy is found for the upper ocean, mirroring the pronounced sea-ice decline in the summer months. Following the 2007 sea-ice minimum, the overall variability in the internal wave field increased significantly, with a wider range of wave amplitudes observed in both summer and winter. This is linked to an overall increase in the wind factor, and may indicate a shift in air-ice-ocean dynamics in the Arctic.",

Within salt marshes, 10-20% of total surface area is covered by marshtop ponds. The fractional area of marshtop ponds is predicted to increase as sea level rises. Despite their potential importance, the balance between autotrophic and heterotrophic processes within such ponds remain poorly understood. To quantify the balance of metabolic fluxes within salt marsh ponds, chemical fluxes of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved oxygen (DO) were measured in July, 2014 in benthic flux chambers inserted into a salt marsh pond in the Plum Island Estuary Long-Term Ecosystem Research (PIE-LTER) site. Light and dark chambers were used to enable separation of rates of photosynthesis and respiration. Separate chambers were used to enclose sediment covered by primarily benthic microalgae and primarily benthic macroalgae. Net ecosystem metabolism in the microalgae was ~10 and in the macroalgae ~15 mmol C/m2/hour. Respiration rates were ~10 mmol C/m2/ hour for both microalgae and macroalgae. The resulting fluxes of net ecosystem production in the ponds will be compared with overall marsh net ecosystem flux as measured by an eddy flux tower that was located 100 meters from the pond.

            "abstract": "Sodium chloride is the main de-icing agent used during the winter in Canada and the northern United States. However, little is known about the long term fate, residence time, and ecological effects of chloride. This talk integrates work taking place across three sites in Southern Ontario, Canada: Hamilton Harbour, the Toronto lakeshore, and Lake Simcoe. We quantify chloride inputs, outputs, and changes in storage for a number of watersheds across a gradient of urbanization. For the three winter months (January, February, March), we show that stream water chloride concentrations approach those of brackish waters for urban watersheds. Chloride is also highly persistent, with stream water chloride concentrations decreasing from the winter months and approaching baseline levels only in July. These baseline levels are greater than 100 mg Cl/l in the urban watersheds, suggesting high levels of chloride storage in soil and groundwater. Using road salt application rates and groundwater levels and chloride concentrations, we estimate the magnitude and residence time of the chloride pools in a number of watersheds across a gradient of urbanization. Our results suggest that the magnitude and residence time of chloride storage varies with urbanization and other factors. We show that summer baseflow concentrations do approach the EPA’s chronic exposure guideline of 230 mg Cl/l, implying more work is needed to understand the in stream and downstream ecological effects of chloride.",

            "abstract": "Observations of the initial parts of lightning flashes close to Langmuir Laboratory in central New Mexico appear to show the lightning initiation process. The observations were made on August 5, 2013, from a number of flashes within 5 km of the New Mexico Tech broadband VHF interferometer (INTF). In addition to the INTF, the flashes were observed by the Langmuir Laboratory Lightning Mapping Array (LMA), and by close fast and slow antennas. For those flashes where the powers of the initial sources detected by the LMA were stronger than about 5 dBW (4 watts), the INTF observations showed that the initial LMA source was associated with a previously unidentified form of fast positive breakdown. No activity was detected prior to the positive breakdown, either by the sensitive INTF or fast electric measurements. The VHF radiation and electric field changes develop simultaneously, and the INTF shows a positive breakdown which propagates about one hundred meters. This and other features of the observations indicate that the breakdown occurs in virgin air and is produced by dielectric streamer processes in localized regions of strong electric fields. We observed both normal intracloud and cloud-to-ground discharges to be initiated by such breakdown. After the fast positive breakdown died out, the INTF showed continuous negative breakdown at the start of the positive channel, which subsequently developed into a negative leader propagating in the opposite direction of the initial positive breakdown. The results are fundamentally consistent with those obtained from modelling studies by Liu et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett.109, 025002, 2012), in which positive sprite streamers were shown to be initiated by purely dielectric breakdown, without the need of an initiating event such as a cosmic ray or energetic electron avalanches. We speculate that all lightning flashes are initiated by the fast positive events.",

            "abstract": "The Central Gneiss Complex, located in western British Columbia, preserves mid and lower crustal igneous and metasedimentary rocks that yield insight into deformational and thermal processes at the roots of a continental magmatic arc. The complex primarily consists of gneiss interpreted as a volcanic sequence with calcareous interlayers and lesser clastic metasedimentary rocks. Cretaceous U-Pb zircon ages from granulite-facies equivalent rocks in the core of the complex hint at rapid burial following deposition. However, a Permian or older crinoid fossil found in one locality (Hill, 1985) requires the presence of some late Paleozoic or early Mesozoic material. A new U-Pb zircon age (313±5 Ma; LA-ICPMS) from ~10 km west of this fossil locality is interpreted to record volcanism. We also conducted focused structural and geochronological analysis at higher structural levels in the northeastern Central Gneiss Complex to positively identify sedimentary lithologies with which to document the early structural history of the complex prior to early Cenozoic rapid exhumation. In this area, a subhorizontal shear zone forms the boundary between mainly clastic metasedimentary rocks and the widespread metavolcanic and carbonate rocks where an important stretched pebble conglomerate has been previously documented. In the footwall of the shear zone, flattening fabrics transition structurally upward into E-W trending stretching lineations, lineation-parallel isoclinal fold axes, and boudinage that record E-W stretching and major shear strain near the contact. S-C fabrics and shear bands yield a top to the east sense of shear. Where observed, a shallowly dipping, ~15 m thick zone of cataclasite forms the lithologic contact and overprints the shear zone. Sills and dikes record ongoing but localized magmatism throughout deformation and steep NE striking brittle normal faults crosscut all features. Ongoing work will further constrain the protolith age of these rocks, the timing of deformation, and whether the shear zone is a folded low angle normal fault \u0004\u0005or instead related to regional thrust burial. This will yield insight into sediment burial and metamorphism at subduction zones and its potential influence on magmatic arc productivity and middle and lower crustal deformation processes.",

            "abstract": "Temperature is a key factor for salmonid health and is an important restoration metric on the Middle Fork of the John Day River, northeast Oregon. The longest undammed tributary to the Columbia, the headwaters of the Middle Fork are crucial to steelhead and spring Chinook and summer Chinook juvenile rearing. In the past century the river has been altered by dredge mining, overgrazing, logging activities, and irrigation resulting in bank erosion, low effective shade, and channelization. These factors decreased fish habitat and led to increased stream temperature maxima. Restoration has focused on restoring fish habitat, creating thermal refugia, and planting native vegetation. The most recent completed restoration project diverted the flow into the historic, meandering stream channel from the dredged, straightened channel.\nOver the past seven years, Oregon State University researchers (Tara O’Donnell-2012, Julie Huff-2009) have been involved in a planned-to-be 10-year stream temperature monitoring study to assess maximum temperatures during low-flow summer months. The use of fiber optics through distributed temperature sensing (DTS) made it possible to record high resolution temperature data at both temporal and spatial scales; data which is used to assess the efficacy of restoration efforts on the reach. Furthermore, DTS provided temperature data that reveals subtle hydrologic processes such as groundwater or hyporheic inflows and quantifies their effect on the stream. Current research has focused on large scale DTS installations on the Middle Fork of the John Day River on the Oxbow, Forrest, and the upstream Galena (“RPB”) conservation properties. In the summers of 2013 and 2014, 16 km of river were monitored.\nOur study compares temperatures before and after the restoration project and provides essential guidance for future restoration projects. Direct comparisons coupled with a deterministic modeling using HeatSource assist in better understanding the responsiveness of the stream to restoration. Results showed that reconstructing the stream channel influenced stream temperature as a function of modifying channel geometry, hydraulics, and riparian conditions. Special attention in this work is focused on the role of tributary fans in the creation of distributed cold-water emergences.",

            "abstract": "Active deformation and mountain building in the Canadian Cordillera ceased in the Paleogene, a period during which this orogen was among the highest on earth. The present morphology, relief and altitude of the mountains and the foothills in the adjacent foreland belt are the result of a feedback relationship between erosion and isostatic compensation. Our low temperature thermochronology data (U-Th/He ages on zircon and apatite) were collected from 5 sample-transects spanning the Intermontane, Omineca, Foreland, and Foothills belts along a Jasper-Vancouver transect. The data show rapid cooling (>15℃/Ma) from >180℃ to <70℃ in the interior belts to the west of the Rocky Mountain Trench (RMT) during the Eocene (56 – 33 Ma). In the Foreland and Foothills belts to the east of the RMT the data show modest cooling (~4℃/Ma) during the latest Cretaceous to Early Eocene (~80Ma – 55 Ma) followed by rapid cooling (~15℃/Ma) between ~55 Ma and ~45 Ma transitioning to slower cooling (~1℃/Ma) after 45 Ma. This cooling pattern is consistent with rapid regional uplift and exhumation across the interior belts of the Cordillera during a regional transition from contraction to extension in the early to middle Eocene. At the same time in the Foreland and Foothills belts, during a period of accelerated cooling, contraction was continuing. The combination of rapid exhumation and extension in the interior belts and rapid exhumation and contraction in the Foreland and Foothills belts is similar to what is observed around the Altiplano and Tibetan plateaus. This suggests that the Canadian Cordillera is a fossil plateau (Columbia Plateau) that formed in the Eocene. The lack of a mantle lithosphere beneath the interior belts of the Canadian Cordillera (west of the RMT) and the regional extent of rapid exhumation suggests that the Columbia Plateau formed in response to a large-scale lithosphere removal event; possibly wholesale delamination.",

            "abstract": "The record of light stable isotope signatures in early solar system materials provides key constraints on the formation environment, mixing processes, and loss processes that influenced the solar nebula. Considering first the Sun, the NASA Genesis mission showed that the solar wind has a 17O depletion that is slightly more negative than the isotopically lightest CAIs (McKeegan et al. 2011), but still only yields an inferred photospheric (and bulk) solar O isotope composition. Recent reanalysis of astronomical measurement of O isotopes from infrared CO lines (Ayres et al. 2013) argues for a similarity in d18O for the directly observed photosphere and the inferred photosphere from Genesis, in contrast to the wildly divergent astronomical values previously reported. The accuracy of the Ayres et al. results are limited by the accuracy of the IR oscillator strength models; I will report on the impact of new oscillator strength models for CO. Turning to the CAIs, the Genesis O isotope results are consistent with CO self-shielding as the mechanism for producing the CAI mixing line from a mixture of photo-produced H2O (17O-enriched) and solar-like initial material (Clayton 2002; Lyons and Young 2005). Two other mechanisms have been proposed: 17O enrichment from 1) high temperature SiO reactions with OH (Chakraborty et al. 2013), and 2) transfer from low temperature O3 formation on dust. I will critique both of these suggested mechanisms. Finally, N isotope ratios, which span a range in d15N values from ~-400 permil for the Sun (Marty et al. 2011) and solar nebula, to +1000s permil for hotspots in CB chondrites, are influenced by low temperature ion-molecule reactions, and potentially by photoprocesses. Heays et al. (2014) have shown that N2 photolysis can produce very large 15N enrichments in product HCN in a static protoplanetary disk. I will present similar calculations for a turbulently mixed disk. Implications for cometary isotopic composition will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Vegetation is a major component of the climate system because of its controls on the energy and water balance over land. This functioning changes because of the physiological response of leaves to increased CO2. A climate model is used to compare these changes with the climate changes from radiative forcing by greenhouse gases. For this purpose, we use the Community Earth System Model coupled to a slab ocean. Ensemble integrations are done for current and doubled CO2. The consequent reduction of transpiration and net increase of surface radiative heating from reduction in cloudiness increases the temperature over land by a significant fraction of that directly from the radiative warming by CO2. Large-scale atmospheric circulation adjustments result. In particular, over the tropics, a low-level westerly wind anomaly develops associated with reduced geopotential height over land, enhancing moisture transport and convergence, and precipitation increases over the western Amazon, the Congo basin, South Africa, and Indonesia, while over mid-latitudes, land precipitation decreases from reduced evapotranspiration. On average, land precipitation is enhanced by 0.03 mm day-1 (about 19 % of the CO2 radiative forcing induced increase). This increase of land precipitation with decreased ET is an apparent negative feedback, i.e., less ET makes more precipitation. Global precipitation is slightly reduced. Runoff increases associated with both the increased land precipitation and reduced evapotranspiration. Examining the consistency of the variations among ensemble members shows that vegetation feedbacks on precipitation are more robust over the tropics and in mid to high latitudes than over the subtropics where vegetation is sparse and the internal climate variability has a larger influence.",

Solid-state detectors aboard low altitude satellite, STSAT-1, were used for the measurements of the electron energy spectra. In order to measure the pitch angle distribution, we rotated the satellite’s attitude about 90° with respect to the geomagnetic field line. The results show sharp boundary at the loss cone angle of 55°. To demonstrate the pitch angle distribution, we simulated drift loss and diffusion effect for longitude by solving the diffusion equation. While the pitch angle distribution measurements were performed at the altitude of 700 km, latitude of 70° and longitude of 130°E, the drift electrons are lost in the SAA region. Accordingly, the observed electrons are results of pitch angle diffusion from loss cone boundary and we can estimate minimum diffusion coefficient. In our model, the pitch angle diffusion coefficient should be larger than 1.0x105 rad2/sec",

            "abstract": "Irrigated agriculture is the largest user of freshwater resources in arid/semi-arid parts of the world. Meeting rapidly growing demands in food, feed, fiber, and fuel while minimizing environmental pollution under a changing climate requires significant improvements in agricultural water management and irrigation scheduling. Although recent advances in remote sensing techniques and hydrological modeling has provided valuable information on agricultural water resources and their management, real improvements will only occur if farmers, the decision makers on the ground, are provided with simple, affordable, and practical tools to schedule irrigation events. This presentation reviews efforts in developing methods based on ground-based infrared thermometry and thermography for day-to-day management of irrigation systems. The results of research studies conducted in Colorado and Oklahoma show that ground-based remote sensing methods can be used effectively in quantifying water stress and consequently triggering irrigation events. Crop water use estimates based on stress indices have also showed to be in good agreement with estimates based on other methods (e.g. surface energy balance, root zone soil water balance, etc.). Major challenges toward the adoption of this approach by agricultural producers include the reduced accuracy under cloudy and humid conditions and its inability to forecast irrigation date, which is a critical knowledge since many irrigators need to decide about irrigations a few days in advance.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol-cloud interactions constitute one of the most uncertain aspects of anthropogenic climate change estimates. The magnitude of these interactions as represented in climate models strongly depends on the process of aerosol activation. This process is the most direct physical link between aerosols and cloud microphysical properties. Calculation of droplet number in GCMs requires the computation of new droplet formation (i.e., droplet activation), through physically based activation parameterizations. Considerable effort has been placed in ensuring that droplet activation parameterizations have a physically consistent response to changes in aerosol number concentration. However, recent analyses using an adjoint sensitivity approach showed that parameterizations can exhibit considerable biases in their response to other aerosol properties, such as aerosol modal diameter or to the aerosol chemical composition. This is a potentially important factor in estimating aerosol indirect effects since changes in aerosol properties from pre-industrial times to present day exhibit a very strong regional signature. In this work we use the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM5) to show that the regional imprint of the changes in aerosol properties during the last century interacts with the droplet activation parameterization in a way that these biases are amplified over climatically relevant regions. Two commonly used activation routines, the CAM5 default, Abdul-Razzak and Ghan parameterization, as well as the Fountoukis and Nenes parameterization are used in this study. We further explored the impacts of Nd parameterization biases in the first and second aerosol indirect effects separately, by performing simulations were droplet number was not allowed to intervene in the precipitation initiation process. The simulations performed show that an unphysical response to changes in the diameter of accumulation mode aerosol translates into extremely high Nd concentrations over South-East Asia, producing a dramatic effect on the second aerosol indirect effect. The strength of the indirect effect over South-East Asia was shown to be a dominant factor in the global estimate of aerosol indirect effect in the CAM5 model.",

            "abstract": "Periodic upwelling events are known to occur off the coast of New Jersey during the summer. As with upwelling off the US West Coast, these events can transport acidified water to the surface and shoreward. To determine if upwelling events have the potential to impact shellfish hatcheries in New Jersey, a monitoring study was conducted at the Aquaculture Innovation Center (AIC) of Rutgers University. The AIC is an important hatchery supporting the New Jersey oyster aquaculture industry through the production of disease resistant seed oysters. Starting in June of 2014, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and pH were continuously monitored at the AIC’s intake pipe. Periodic grab samples were also collected at the intake and at locations within the facility. Grab samples were preserved and analyzed for pH and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). DIC and pH were used to calculate the aragonite saturation state of the sampled water. During an upwelling event in early July a drop in pH was measured at the intake. Grab samples showed that water of lower pH and aragonite saturation was entering the facility. These results show that hatcheries along the NJ coast need to be aware that upwelling events may bring conditions detrimental for shellfish production.",

            "abstract": "Recent research rejects the traditional perspective that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) component in global carbon cycle are simply trivial, and in fact evidence demonstrates that lakes likely mediate carbon dynamics on a global scale. Riverine and estuarine carbon fluxes play a critical role in transporting and recycling carbon and nutrients, not only within watersheds but in their receiving waters. However, the underlying mechanisms that drive carbon fluxes, from land to rivers, lake and oceans, remain poorly understood. This presentation will report a research result of the scale-dependent DOC production rate in coastal watersheds and DOC transport processes in estuarine regions. We conducted a series of controlled experiments and field measurements for examining biogeochemical, biological, and geospatial variables that regulate downstream processing on global-relevant carbon fluxes. Results showed that increased temperatures and raised soil moistures accelerate decomposition rates of organic matter with significant variations between vegetation types. The measurements at meso-scale ecosystem demonstrated a good correlation to bulk concentration of DOC monitored in receiving waters at the outlets of sub-basins (R2 > 0.65). These field and experimental measurements improved the model of daily carbon exports through below-ground processes as a function of the organic matter content of surface soils, forest litter supply, and temperature. The study demonstrated a potential improvement in modeling the co-variance of CDOM and DOC with the unique terrestrial sources. This improvement indicated a significant promise for monitoring riverine and estuarine carbon flux from satellite images. The technical innovations include deployments of 1) mini-ecosystem (mesocosms) with soil as replicate controlled experiments for DOC production and leaching rates, and 2) aquatic mesocosms for co-variances of DOC and CDOM endmembers, and an instrumented incubation experiment for determining degradation rates.",

            "abstract": "Although precipitation and actual evapotranspiration measurements have a long tradition, accurate estimates of precipitation (P) and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) remain a challenge. Our study compares actual evapotranspiration estimates acquired with the Eddy-Covariance (EC) method and ETa measurements by a set of six redundant weighable lysimeters for a managed grassland site at Rollesbroich (Eifel, Western Germany). The comparison of ETa measured by EC (accounting for energy balance deficit correction) and by lysimeters is hardly reported in literature and gains more insight into the performance of both techniques. The evaluation of ETa estimates by both methods for the year 2012 shows a good agreement with a total difference of ca. 4 %, which is mainly related to variations in grass height at the lysimeters and in the EC footprint. We also used the lysimeter records to estimate precipitation amounts in combination with the AWAT filter algorithm. The estimated precipitation volumes of the lysimeter measurements show significant differences compared to the precipitation data of the Hellman type tipping bucket rain gauge at the test site. For the entire year 2012 the lysimeter measurements exhibit a 16 % higher precipitation amount than the tipping bucket data. With help of an on-site video surveillance system the precipitation data of the lysimeters were investigated in more detail. It was found that the precipitation surplus in lysimeter records in part is related to the detection of rime and dew, which contributes 17 % to the yearly difference between both methods. We concluded that weighable lysimeter data can be used to simultaneously estimate precipitation and actual evapotranspiration in a reliable fashion. Furthermore, lysimeter allow a plausible detection of rime and dew in contrast to standard rain gauges.",

            "abstract": "Biomass burning emissions contribute to a large fraction of global organic aerosol (OA) emissions. In most models, radiative forcing of black carbon (BC) and OA from biomass burning offsets each other to give a small or close to zero total forcing, i.e., an estimate of 0 (-0.2 to +0.2) W m-2 by IPCC-AR5. Recent observational and modeling studies have shown the absorbing part of OA, referred to as “brown” carbon (BrC), to be a significant source of direct absorption of solar radiation thus positive forcing, in particular over regions dominated by biomass burning and biofuel emissions. Here we implement optical treatment for the BrC absorption in the CESM1/CAM5 model, and compare the calculated aerosol spectral absorption with ground-based AERONET and DOE/ARM observations. In this version of CAM5, biomass burning and biofuel OA are treated separately from fossil fuel OA with different imaginary refractive index. Because the absorption of BrC is highly variable and uncertain depending on source, aging, and mixing state, sensitivity studies of BrC refractive index parameterized by fuel type and ratio of BC to OA mass will be examined and the resulting uncertainty in the estimated forcing will be discussed. Preliminary results suggest the simulated wavelength dependence of aerosol absorption, as measured by the absorption Ångström exponent (AAE), increases from 0.9 for non-absorbing OA to 1.2 (or 1.0) for strongly (or moderately) absorbing BrC. The AAE calculated for the strongly absorbing BrC agrees with AERONET spectral observations at 440–870 nm over most regions but overpredicts for the open biomass burning-dominated South America and southern Africa, in which inclusion of moderately absorbing BrC exhibits better agreement.",

            "abstract": "Auroral transitional line emissions have often been used to infer the fluence and characteristic energy of precipitating electrons. A common practice is to use emissions from an allowed transition to infer absolute particle flux since the odds of quenching before photon emission are negligible. Characteristic energy is then determined by line emission intensity ratios between a forbidden and allowed transitions: The intensity of a forbidden transition will increase with altitude since the probability for quenching drops with decreasing density. Bright metastable lines such as 630.0 nm O(1D) -> O(3P) and the 557.7 nm O(1S) -> O(1D) are often used with a prompt line such as 427.8 nm N2+(1N) to determine characteristic energy. With the advances in scientific cameras, narrow-band filtered video of pulsing aurora up to 32 fps are now in use. The question then becomes, if the transitional lifetimes of the metastable species are significantly greater (or even comparable to) the aurora pulsing period, how can the ratio technique be used to determine the characteristic energy of the precipitating electrons? Once it is realized that the quoted lifetimes are average values, we note that there will be a fraction of photons that are emitted before the species is quenched. With this study, we present results from the GLOW model for different metastable species to determine the optimal combination of lines that would be helpful in determination of precipitating electron characteristics in pulsing aurora up to 100 Hz. Enabling technology and optimal configurations will be presented, along with suggested applications for linking different optical signatures with their corresponding precipitating electron distribution shape.",

            "abstract": "After the 2011 Tohoku-Oki Earthquake, we realized that the interplate coupling can be extended to the trench even for subducting slab of great age. Monitoring the recovering process of the coupling after the earthquake may provide important knowledge on the total perspective of this great earthquake. For this purpose, Japanese government decided to strengthen the monitoring systems by means of seafloor geodesy. Constructing a GPS/Acoustic network along the trench is one of these projects. Before the earthquake, only five (Japan Coast Guard) and three (Tohoku Univ.) benchmarks were working off-Tohoku area, however, in 2012, we have newly installed up to 20 benchmarks along the trench, especially close to the trench. We took place GPS/Acoustic surveys after the installation and have carried out four times of campaign surveys until 2013 (FY). Not all the benchmarks were measured in each campaign, however, three times of campaigns were made for most of the benchmarks ranging 1 or 1.5 years. Because of such a short period of data accumulation and hard conditions on the accuracy due to great depth (>5000 m) than before, the estimated errors in the obtained displacement vectors are typically 5-10 cm for most of the benchmarks, which are not enough to clearly address the postseismic deformation. Nevertheless, some benchmarks, one is at relatively close to the coast and the other is on the incoming Pacific plate off-Miyagi, show significant WNW-ward movements up to 17 cm/yr, which is much larger than interseismic subducting rate. This gives a strong constraint to evaluate the viscoelastic relaxation process after the earthquake. More campaign surveys are planned in the next year to accumulate the data for improvement of the total accuracy in the displacement vectors for all the benchmarks. In addition, we are dedicated in improving the analytic technique to reduce error sources, such as acoustic signal processing and sound speed correction to lessen the uncertainty in each campaign data. In the presentation, we will introduce our measured results above and additional benchmarks applying the analytical improvement.",

These fracture patterns can also create azimuthally dependent attenuation in seismic amplitudes due to a preferential scattering direction. A parallel set of surface (or bed) crevasses in a glacier is an example of one such fracture pattern. These patterns are caused by the local strains within the glacier. In this study we analyze an active source 3D seismic survey recorded at Bench Glacier, Alaska, USA. We compare the Rayleigh group wave velocity as a function of azimuth and estimate that the mean velocity is 1672 m/s and 1% velocity anisotropy exists. We present an interpretation for the observed anisotropy by comparing our results with satellite imagery of the glacier in the survey area. Finally, we present the results of ongoing analysis of the Rayleigh wave amplitudes and compare with existing studies of glacier attenuation that do not take into account scattering attenuation when estimating the ice temperature from attenuation.",

However, the LA UHI is uniquely affected by California's diverse topography and microclimates. The city also lacks well defined rural areas that are characteristic of UHI. Our study looks at urban thermal patterns and the state of the UHI in recent years.

The emission, which is generated through a proton ring type distribution, is important for electron acceleration in the Earth’s radiation belts. Although the wave normal angle is confined within several degrees about 90 degrees observationally, the effectiveness of electron acceleration is still sensitive to the wave normal angle in this narrow range. In this presentation, the dependence of magnetosonic waves instability on wave normal angle (up to 90 degrees) and frequency is systematically investigated. We find that magnetosonic wave growth rate can peak at 90 deg with sharp harmonic structure, and as wave normal angle decreases the growth rate becomes weaker and gradually turns continuous with respect to frequency. The importance of magnetosonic waves on electron acceleration is also discussed.",

            "abstract": "In 1975, as a result of area residents and local governments becoming increasingly alarmed by the continued impact of subsidence on economic growth and quality of life in the region, the Harris-Galveston Coastal Subsidence District was created by the 64th Texas Legislature as an underground water conservation district. The primary mission of what is now the Harris-Galveston Subsidence District, is to provide for the regulation of the withdrawal of groundwater to control subsidence.\nSubsidence has been a concern in the Houston, TX area throughout most of recent history. Since 1906, over 10 feet of subsidence has occurred, with a broad area of 6 feet of subsidence throughout most of the Houston Area.\nOver its nearly forty years of existence, the District has developed substantial data sets providing the foundation for its regulatory plan. Annual water-level measurements, a network of deep extensometers, over 80 subsidence GPS monitors, and updated numerical and analytical models have been utilized. Periodically, the District utilizes U.S. Census data to predict the future magnitude and location of population and water demand. In 2013, all of these data sets were combined producing an updated regulatory plan outlining the timelines of conversion to alternative sources of water and defining the maximum percentage groundwater can contribute to a user’s total water demand.\nThe management of the groundwater resources within the District has involved significant coordination with regional ground and surface water suppliers; ongoing interaction with other state and local regulatory bodies; analysis of accurate and up to date predictions on water usage; the enforcement of real disincentives to those who rely too heavily on groundwater and a commitment to practicing and promoting water conservation.Water supplies in the region are projected to continue to be stressed in the future due to rapid population increases in the region. Future District efforts will be focused on maintaining the successes of the past while evaluating potential deeper groundwater resources and any potential subsidence resulting from future development.",

            "abstract": "Accurate estimates of fault slip rates based on geodetic data rely on measurements that represent the long-term deformation of the crust. In the Central Walker Lane/Sierra Nevada transition, the Long Valley Caldera region has experienced multiple episodes of uplift and subsidence during the last four decades. The latest episode began in late 2011 and is detectable as a transient signal in the time series of GPS stations around the caldera. These transient signals become more apparent and reveal the extent of the impact on the ambient crustal deformation field of the Walker Lane when the velocity vectors are transformed to a Sierra-Nevada reference frame. Estimating contemporary slip-rates on faults for the purpose of seismic hazard assessment in the region around Long Valley requires detecting and subtracting the transient signals caused by the uplift and subsidence in the caldera.\nWe estimate the geographic extent to which the ambient crustal deformation field is significantly perturbed by ongoing magmatic activity in Long Valley. We present a time variable 3D deformation field constrained by InSAR and GPS observations, and discuss the implications that tectonic-magmatic interaction have for estimates of present-day fault slip-rate. We model the time dependent deformation at Long Valley by analyzing InSAR time series from Envisat and ERS interferograms spanning a period of more than 19 years. We use an analytical volcano deformation source model derived from vertical (GPS) and line of site (InSAR) component of geodetic observations to estimate the horizontal component of the signals associated with magmatic activity beneath the caldera. Previous studies showed that the latest episode of uplift can be modeled with a Mogi source located at a depth of ~6 km with a volume change of 0.03 km3 beneath the resurgent dome. This model predicts a perturbation to the ambient crustal deformation field extending as far as 60 km from the center of the resurgent dome. Thus the area affected by Long Valley extends from north of Mono Lake southward to Owens Lake, and eastward to the Mina deflection of the Walker Lane, potentially influencing the estimated slip rates for a dozen or more major faults.",

Black Carbon (BC) is considered of great climatic importance and is the main absorber of sunlight in the atmosphere. Besides, wet and dry deposition of BC on snow cause reduction of snow and ice albedo. This will cause sea ice and snow to warm and melt more quickly. WRF-STEM model is used to predict the transport of aerosols from different geographical sources and sectors (i.e. transportation, residential, industry, biomass burning and power) to the Arctic. The model is evaluated and interpreted with the observations from NASA ARCTAS campaign flights in spring and summer 2008. Furthermore, the amount of particles deposited (by wet and dry deposition) is calculated. The results show that the major sector contributor to BC concentration is residential and the main source region contribution is from Europe annually. Both wet and dry deposition shows seasonality with the maximum occurring during spring for BC dry deposition and during summer for BC wet deposition",

The Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor (LVIS) is a wide swath, full-waveform laser altimeter that has been operational since the late 1990’s and has mapped 100,000’s of square kilometers around the globe. NASA is developing a Facility version of the LVIS sensor to make it more cost-effective and more easily available to the broader science community. Based heavily on the existing LVIS sensor, the Facility LVIS instrument includes numerous improvements for reliability, resolution, real-time performance monitoring, lower cost for integration and ops, and data consistency. Building upon the foundation provided by LVIS, the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) Lidar was recently selected for funding as a part of NASA’s Earth Venture Program and will use multiple laser beams to measure high-resolution forest structure and surface topography from the International Space Station (ISS). Dependent on the funding profile and availability of launch options to ISS, GEDI could launch as early as 2018. Within a single year of operations GEDI will provide billions of vegetation height and structure measurements for the precise estimation of biomass within the orbital coverage provided by ISS (+/- 51.6 degrees latitude). GEDI uses the same high-SNR waveform measurement technique as the airborne LVIS sensor. LVIS will provide calibration and validation of GEDI’s on-orbit performance.",

            "abstract": "The slip magnitude of the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake rupture was as much as ~50 m below the ~20-km-wide frontal prism of accreted sediments at the trench. Mechanical explanations for prism deformation and shallow slip consider the rate-dependence and dynamic weakening of friction along the basal thrust, dynamic unloading of the thrust from wave propagation into a compliant wedge with a free upper surface, and large magnitude stress release at depth that propagates slip to shallow depths. Borehole data and core samples from IODP expedition 343/343T are used to understand frontal prism behavior over the seismic cycle. Wedge taper, experimental determination of Coulomb failure strength of the prism, and measurements of pore pressure and sediment density are used to determine apparent friction of the basal thrust and stress in the prism for compressively critical and extensionally critical conditions assuming an elastic – perfectly Coulomb plastic wedge. Model results are compared to independent measures of in situ stress in the prism from borehole deformation, sliding friction of basal thrust material at quasi-static and seismic slip-rates in experiments, and the average coseismic shear strength of the thrust from borehole temperature-profiles. These data define the pre-seismic, co-seismic, and post-seismic stress states and suggest the prism remains in a stable, elastic state over the seismic cycle with a dynamic stress drop of approximately 1 MPa in the vicinity of the borehole. Results likely describe the state of the frontal prism ~15-20 km landward from the borehole. Trenchward, however, the prism has a much smaller taper and undergoes coseismic shortening under a compressively critical state and diminishing basal slip. Variations in shallow slip magnitude along the trench could partly reflect changes in prism geometry associated with roughness of the subducting slab and sediment input, and variations in frictional properties of the basal thrust.",

            "abstract": "A double layer (DL) consists of a positive/negative Debye sheath, connecting two quasineutral regions of a plasma. These nonlinear structures can be found in a variety of plasmas, from discharge tubes to space plasmas. It has applications to plasma processing and space propulsion, and its concept is also important for areas such as applied geophysics.\nIn the present work we investigate the ion-acoustic double-layers (IADLs). It is believed that these structures are responsible for the acceleration of auroral electrons, for example. The plasma distributions near a DL are usually non-Maxwellian and can be modeled via a κ distribution function. In its reduced form, the standard κ distribution is equivalent to the distribution function obtained from the maximization of the Tsallis entropy, the q distribution. The parameters κ and q measure the deviation from the Maxwellian equilibrium (\"nonthermality\"), with -κ=1/(1-q) (in the limit κ → ∞ (q → 1) the Maxwellian distribution is recovered).\nThe existence of obliquely propagating IADLs in magnetized two-electron plasmas is investigated, with the hot electron population modeled via a κ distribution function [1]. Our analysis shows that only subsonic and rarefactive DLs exist for the entire range of parameters investigated. The small amplitude DLs exist only for τ=Th/Tc greater than a critical value, which grows as κ decreases. We also observe that these structures exist only for large values of δ=Nh0/N0, but never for δ=1. In our model, which assumes a quasineutral condition, the Mach number M grows as θ decreases (θ is the angle between the directions of the external magnetic field and wave propagation). However, M as well as the DL amplitude are reduced as a consequence of nonthermality. The relation of the quasineutral condition and the functional form of the distribution function with the nonexistence of IADLs has also been analyzed and some interesting results have been obtained. A more detailed discussion about this topic will be presented during the conference.\n",

            "abstract": "Data quality is perhaps one of the most valuable yet misunderstood and unresolved elements of the science data life cycle. This is not without significant effort by many within the international science data community to help develop and improve the meaning of data quality, corresponding standards, tools, and services which, when properly applied, collectively serve the interests of the data provider, data center, and ultimately the end user. It is often thought that the concerns of data quality should be primarily focused on ensuring science data is well characterized and understood by the end user. Although this is a crucial goal, the common result of this singular emphasis is a tendency toward dataset-specific solutions, which are often not planned with long-term preservation in mind. Given the recent flurry and plethora of existing tools and standards with which many of the data quality concerns may be addressed, it can almost be a lifelong pursuit for a single data user or provider to sift through it all or at least to become a savvy expert in a particular standard such as ISO-19157. The other concern is that not all standards are open source (e.g., ISO), thus providing a financial hurdle on top of the already difficult learning curve.\nA systems engineering approach offers a solution to the current data quality debacle by establishing and promoting a uniform and ubiquitous application of standards and solutions across heterogeneous datasets of many science disciplines. Here I present real-world examples along with both existing and theoretical solutions to known data quality concerns using a NASA-inspired systems engineering approach. Part of the problem is “knowing” the specific data quality concerns, which is why one of the tools I use is a simple “Use Case” template, custom-tailored for data quality. This template is designed with heterogeneity of data quality issues in mind. As an aid to this template is a corresponding “Use Case Response”, which provides the systems engineer with an inventory of existing solutions and the degree to which those solutions may meet deliverables required by each use case. The coupling of the “Use Case” with the “Use Case Response” is the primary key to mapping the elements of the knowledge base to the solutions.",

            "abstract": "In efforts to determine hurricane frequency prior to historical records, the often used model of counting presumed washover fans as coarse-grained hurricane deposits that interfinger with fine-grained, quiet, lagoon sediments may be oversimplified. The complexities of hurricane depositional events versus the usual dynamic sedimentological processes of barrier island complexes often makes it difficult to distinguish between expected and typical migrating coarse-grained facies from true hurricane deposits. To avoid some of this potential confusion and to better recognize the frequency of strong hurricane events, it is suggested that studies be focused further inland than the washover fans and that in addition to sedimentological indicators, they include biotic and chemical discriminators as well.\nThese results are part of a broader study examining hurricane deposition along the Texas coast. The focus of this study is on slowly accumulating algal mats near Baffin Bay, Texas, that are punctuated by known hurricane deposits. This marginal lagoonal setting is more than 16 miles away from the Padre Island shorefront. Two cores were taken in 1974 that captured sediments from Hurricane Carla (1970) and Hurricane Beulah (1967). Algal mat depositional rates are on the order of 1.25 cm per year whereas the hurricane sediments are on the order of 45 cm per event. Sediments display flood and ebb surge stages for each event. Additional cores in other parts of the coast have similar sediment accumulation rates.\nIn general, periods of relatively quiet deposition are dominated by Cyprideis ovata and Ammonia becarrii which can tolerate the conditions of these euryhaline and algal-floored ponds. In contrast, hurricane deposits show clear evidence of additional bay and shallow marine assemblages along with coarse-grained sediments, shell and shell fragments, and significant amounts of mud settling after the retreat of the storm surge.",

            "abstract": "In numerical simulations of the solar corona, both for the ambient state and especially for dynamical processes the most computational resources are spent for maintaining the numerical solution in the Low Solar Corona and in the transition region, where the temperature gradients are very sharp and the magnetic field has a complicated topology. The degraded computational efficiency is caused by the need in a highest resolution as well as the use of the fully three-dimensional implicit solver for electron heat conduction. On the other hand, the physical nature of the processes involved is rather simple (which still does not facilitate the numerical methods) as long as the heat fluxes as well as slow plasma motional velocities are aligned with the magnetic field. The Alfven wave turbulence, which is often believed to be the main driver of the solar wind and the main source of the coronal heating, is characterized by the Poynting flux of the waves, which is also aligned with the magnetic field. Therefore, the plasma state in any point of the three-dimensional grid in the Low Solar Corona can be found by solving a set of one-dimensional equations for the magnetic field line (“thread”), which passes through this point and connects it to the chromosphere and to the global Solar Corona. In the present paper we describe an innovative computational technology based upon the use of the magnetic-field-line-threads to forlmulate the boundary condition for the global solar corona model which traces the connection of each boundary point to the cromosphere along the threads.",

We conducted an open-field experimental warming system using infra-red heater in 2011 and regulated the temperature of warmed plots by 3oC higher than that of control plots constantly. The seeds of Pinus densiflora, Abies holophylla, Abies koreana, Betula costata, Quercus variabilis, Fraxinus rhynchophylla, and Zelkova serrata were planted in each 1 m × 1 m plot (n=3) in April, 2012. We collected soil samples from the rhizosphere of 7 tree species. DNA was extracted and PCR-amplified for the bacterial 16S gene targeting V1–V3 region. The paired-end sequencing was performed at Beijing Genome Institute (BGI, Hong Kong, China) using 2× 100 bp Hiseq2000 (Illumina). This study aimed to answer the following prediction/hypothesis: 1) Experimental warming will change the structure of soil bacterial community, 2) There will be distinct ‘indicator group’ which response to warming treatment relatively more sensitive than other groups. 3) Warming treatment will enhance the microbial activity in terms of soil respiration. 4) The rhizoplane bacterial communities for each of 7 tree species will show different response pattern to warming treatment. Since the sequence data does not arrive before the submission deadline, therefore, we would like to present the results and discussions on December 2014, AGU Fall Meeting.",

            "abstract": "The ability to seamlessly integrate information on vegetation structure, function, and dynamics across a continuum of scales, from the field to satellite observations, greatly enhances our ability to understand how terrestrial vegetation-atmosphere interactions change over time and in response to disturbances and global change. For example, ecosystem process models require detailed information on the state (e.g. structure, leaf area index), surface properties (e.g. albedo), and dynamics (e.g. phenology, succession) of ecosystems in order to properly simulate the fluxes of carbon (C), water, and energy from the land to the atmosphere as well as address the vulnerability of ecosystems to environmental, pest and pathogen, and other anthropogenic perturbations. Other activities such as species distribution and environmental niche modeling (SDENM) require not only presence/absence information but also detailed spatial and temporal datasets, including climate and remotely sensed observations, to accurately project species ranges under current and often future climatic scenarios. Despite the many challenges of adequately initializing and parameterizing models, the last several decades have shown a substantial increase in the amount of available data useful for improving ecological predictions. Specifically remote sensing data provides an important data constraint for projecting species and successional changes as well as vegetation dynamics and the fluxes of C, water and energy and the storage of C in ecosystems, principally as a synoptic observational dataset for capturing short- to long-term plant-climate interactions. In this talk we will highlight the current and potential uses of various remotely sensed data sources in constraining process modeling and SDENM activities. We will pay particular attention to the uses of remote sensing as a direct constraint on ecological forecasts or a key observational dataset used to capture plant-climate interactions",

            "abstract": "Urban atmospheres are chemically reactive environments in which anthropogenic emissions can react with natural and anthropogenic components, on time scales of seconds to days, to increase the oxidative potential of the urban atmosphere and to create secondary air pollutants. The oxides of nitrogen (NOx = NO + NO2) are generated by combustion activities, including power plants and vehicles. Tailpipe emissions of NOx contain 10-20% NO2, and 90-80% NO. NO can be oxidized to NO2 by O3, HO2 and RO2species. The latter oxidants can be produced through the photo-oxidation of VOCs. It is likely then that oxidative capacity within a city is spatially heterogeneous since the distribution of anthropogenic (NOx, VOCs) and biogenic (VOCs) emissions varies spatially within the city.\nThe spatial heterogeneity in local oxidative capacity of the urban atmosphere has seldom been measured or modeled at the fine spatial scale of ~250m. In summer 2013 we measured NO and NO2 using passive samplers over two weeks at 144 sites in the Portland Metro area. We used the ratio of NO2 to NOx as an indicator of the local atmospheric oxidative potential. We found the measured percentage of NO2 in NOx ranged from a minimum of 20% to a maximum of 76%, with an average value of 54% (std dev = 12%). The measured NO2/NOx ratio was statistically significantly correlated with both freeways and tree canopy within 250m (r = -0.25 and 0.31 respectively), showing a decreasing fraction of NO2 with increasing length of freeway and an increasing fraction of NO2in areas with greater tree cover, as expected.\nWe will use the NO2 measurements to allocate county-level emissions to the spatial scale of ~250m for the Portland Metro area. Using WRF-Chem, we will then model the urban chemistry at this fine spatial scale, and compare the modeled NO to measured NO. Comparing the modeled and measured NO values will serve a dual purpose: it will help validate the fine spatial-scale WRF-Chem model for Portland, and it will provide an insight into the effectiveness of using the NO2/NOx ratio as an indicator of the potential for urban secondary pollutant formation.",

            "abstract": "Monitoring with in situ environmental sensors and other forms of field-based observation presents many challenges for data management, particularly for large-scale networks consisting of multiple sites, sensors, and personnel. The availability and utility of these data in addressing scientific questions relies on effective cyberinfrastructure that facilitates transformation of raw sensor data into functional data products. It also depends on the ability of researchers to share and access the data in useable formats. In addition to addressing the challenges presented by the quantity of data, monitoring networks need practices to ensure high data quality, including procedures and tools for post processing. Data quality is further enhanced if practitioners are able to track equipment, deployments, calibrations, and other events related to site maintenance and associate these details with observational data. In this presentation we will describe the overall workflow that we have developed for research groups and sites conducting long term monitoring using in situ sensors. Features of the workflow include: software tools to automate the transfer of data from field sites to databases, a Python-based program for data quality control post-processing, a web-based application for online discovery and visualization of data, and a data model and web interface for managing physical infrastructure. By automating the data management workflow, the time from collection to analysis is reduced and sharing and publication is facilitated. The incorporation of metadata standards and descriptions and the use of open-source tools enhances the sustainability and reusability of the data. We will describe the workflow and tools that we have developed in the context of the iUTAH (innovative Urban Transitions and Aridregion Hydrosustainability) monitoring network. The iUTAH network consists of aquatic and climate sensors deployed in three watersheds to monitor Gradients Along Mountain to Urban Transitions (GAMUT). The variety of environmental sensors and the multi-watershed, multi-institutional nature of the network necessitate a well-planned and efficient workflow for acquiring, managing, and sharing sensor data, which should be useful for similar large-scale and long-term networks.",

            "abstract": "This study is motived by a new method for disposing of nuclear waste by injecting it as a dense slurry into a hydraulic fracture that grows downward to great enough depth to permanently isolate the waste. Disposing of nuclear waste using gravity-driven hydraulic fractures is mechanically similar to the upward growth of dikes filled with low density magma. A fundamental question in both applications is how the injected fluid controls the propagation dynamics and fracture geometry (depth and breadth) in three dimensions.\nAnalog experiments in gelatin [e.g., Heimpel and Olson, 1994; Taisne and Tait, 2009] show that fracture breadth (the short horizontal dimension) remains nearly stationary when the process in the fracture “head” (where breadth is controlled) is dominated by solid toughness, whereas viscous fluid dissipation is dominant in the fracture tail. We model propagation of the resulting gravity-driven (buoyant or sinking), finger-like fracture of stationary breadth with slowly varying opening along the crack length. The elastic response to fluid loading in a horizontal cross-section is local and can be treated similar to the classical Perkins-Kern-Nordgren (PKN) model of hydraulic fracturing. The propagation condition for a finger-like crack is based on balancing the global energy release rate due to a unit crack extension with the rock fracture toughness. It allows us to relate the net fluid pressure at the tip to the fracture breadth and rock toughness.\nUnlike the PKN fracture, where breadth is known a priori, the final breadth of a finger-like fracture is a result of processes in the fracture head. Because the head is much more open than the tail, viscous pressure drop in the head can be neglected leading to a 3D analog of Weertman’s hydrostatic pulse. This requires relaxing the local elasticity assumption of the PKN model in the fracture head. As a result, we resolve the breadth, and then match the viscosity-dominated tail with the 3-D, toughness-dominated head to obtain a complete closed-form solution. We then analyze the gravity fracture propagation in conditions of either continuous injection or finite volume release for sets of parameters representative of dense waste injection technique and low viscosity magma diking.",

            "abstract": "Two phased arrays of 9 short-period stations each are currently recording in the Wabash Valley Seismic Zone (WVSZ) as part of the EarthScope Wabash FlexArray project. The phased arrays aim to address the level of microseismicity produced by the intraplate seismic zone. Although seismic hazard maps of the U.S. Midwest are dominated by the New Madrid Seismic Zone (NMSZ), the WVSZ has released 40% more seismic energy than the NMSZ over the last half century with four events larger than M5 and only one in the NMSZ reaching that threshold. A comparison of event frequency statistics suggests two markedly different systems. The NMSZ exhibits b-values near unity, but the WVSZ exhibits much smaller b-values in the 0.6-0.7 range. Deviations less than unity may be controlled through crack geometry and/or greater shear stresses possibly indicating a time-dependent, or migrating, behavior in mid-continent. Alternatively, it may be the case that the low b-values are simply a reflection of less complete catalog than the NMSZ. A previous short-term microseismicity study of the WVSZ shows a dearth of non-anthropogenic sources in the Wabash. The phased array near the central portion of the WVSZ largely confirms the previously noted lack of substantial natural seismicity along the central portion of the fault system and the associated low b-values. However, the phased array near the southern termination of the fault system shows significantly more activity. Importantly, the largest events from the Wabash, including the 2008 M5.4 Mt. Carmel and the 1968 M5.5 Harrisburg events occurred near the northern and southern ends of the fault system. The phased arrays seem to indicate different portions of the fault system yielding different levels of activity. As the catalogs become more complete, there is a preliminary suggestion that the anomalously low b-values for the Wabash do not denote a system under significantly larger stresses, but rather a conflation of regions along-strike of the fault system with differing a-values. A more thorough accounting of seismic activity in the Wabash from multiple phased arrays is promising a better understanding the relative hazard posed by the WVSZ compared to the NMSZ,which may ultimately have a shorter recurrence time between large events than NMSZ and would therefore prove to have the greater associated hazard.",

            "abstract": "Suspended sediment transported through watersheds comes from many sources, streambank erosion being one of the most common non-point sources. As the frequency of precipitation events in the Northeast is expected to increase, the erosional processes in the watershed and along the stream channel are expected to follow suit. Phosphorus and nutrients from various sources bind to the suspended sediment, causing a rise in the concentrations in Vermont waterways and lakes. Therefore, quantifying streambank erosion is a prerequisite to reliably predicting geomorphic channel responses and their impacts on rivers and receiving waters. In this work, we use periodic aerial photography and 3D scans of streambanks, collected using a terrestrial laser scanner, to quantify erosion rates and sediment loadings at select streambank sites in the Mad River watershed in Vermont. Streambank erosion is also estimated from turbidity monitoring on tributaries and the outlet of the Mad River watershed. The streambank erosion measured at monitoring sites is then compared to the estimates from the turbidity monitoring to more reliably quantify loading from streambanks. Total phosphorus (TP) data collected from a variety of sites throughout the region are being used to calibrate simple models to convert sediment loading to TP loading. The sediment and nutrient loading from streambanks is then used to inform conceptual sediment and nutrient budgets for the Mad River watershed.",

            "abstract": "Due to low natural gas prices, low production rates, and increased development costs, many operators have shifted operations from shale gas to liquid-rich shale plays. One means to make shale gas plays more attractive is to enhance well production through stimulation optimization. In numerous previous works, the authors have highlighted the geomechanical causes and important parameters for hydraulic fracture optimization in naturally fractured shale plays. The authors have, for example, emphasized the impact that stress shadows, from multiple hydraulic fractures, has on increasing the resistance of natural fractures and weakness planes to shear stimulation. The authors have also shown the critical role that in-situ pressure and pressure changes have on natural fracture shear stimulation.In this paper, we present the results of a discrete element model numerical study of both hydraulic fracture spacing and hydraulic fracture timing in a fully hydro-mechanical coupled fashion. The pressure changes in the natural fracture system of an unconventional play, due to hydraulic fracturing, often follow a diffusion-type process, which means the pressure changes are time dependent. As shown in previous works of the authors and others, the time-dependent changes in the in-situ pressure can have a marked impact on shear stimulation. The study performed quantitatively looked at the impact of hydraulic fracture spacing as a function of in-situ pressure change and time for key parameters such as the in-situ stress ratio, natural fracture characteristics, and natural fracture mechanical properties. The results of the study help improve the understanding of in-situ pressure and hydraulic fracture timing on stimulation optimization and enhanced hydrocarbon production. The study also provides a means to optimize hydraulic fracture spacing and increase shear stimulation for unconventional wells.",

The energy and anisotropy are contained predominantly in the larger scales of motion, but most of the computational effort in a direct numerical simulation (DNS) is expended on the smallest dissipative motions. We present preliminary results from a large eddy simulation (LES) with periodic cubic geometry, where we do not attempt to simulate all the wavenumber modes up to the viscous cut-off. Only the large scales are explicitly resolved, while the interaction of the large scales with the smaller scales is modeled. The model is localized by dynamical calculation of the closure parameters. The performance of different models is evaluated by comparison of LES results with data from a higher resolution DNS. We intend this study to form a basis for the implementation of the large eddy simulation technique in a global simulation of the solar wind.",

Much work is still needed in order to fully understand the coupling mechanism and allow for the development of effective tsunami detection/warning systems. These challenges include the need for additional observations of the tsunami ionospheric signature to provide new scientific insight into the geophysical source phenomenology and wave propagation physics, and to better constrain the conditions under which ocean-atmospheric coupling is effective.\nOne of the ionospheric signatures of tsunamis is a Traveling Ionospheric Disturbance (TID). ASTRA has developed a realtime TID Mapping System based on HF radio sounding. We will provide examples of TIDs associated with various tsunamis, including the propagation characteristics of the TIDs.\nWe are deploying an expanded ground-based observation network using strategically placed optical imaging systems together with ASTRA’s TID Mapping Systems, to obtain new information about the ionospheric waves associated with tsunamis. We will also use a published and validated gravity wave ray trace model to perform studies of the propagation of tsunami-generated gravity waves through the atmosphere and into the thermosphere/ionosphere system. This work will also enhance our understanding of upward coupling caused by all gravity wave sources in the lower atmosphere (not just tsunamis) and how this coupling can generate ionospheric irregularities that affect navigation, communications and surveillance systems.",

            "abstract": "A recent leveling survey (Ching et al., 2011) across the southern Central Range in Taiwan shows a significant gradient in the rate of uplift along the eastern flank of the range, with western sites recording generally higher rates of uplift. To understand the origin of this gradient, we collected brittle fault data along a 32 km section of the range near the village of Lidao and documented more than 150 outcrop-scale faults of which 94 recorded a normal sense of slip, 41 recorded strike-slip and 15 were unknown. We also recognized two styles of deformation: A) fault characterized by calcite or quartz ﬁbers on the fault plane and B) faults characterized by fault gauge or breccia on the fault plane. The highest concentration of faults occurs in the area of the Wulu Gorge, east of Liado and most are NE-dipping normal faults. Paleostress inversion of the faults identified two phases of deformation. Phase 1 (i.e., stress state with the most faults) shows a sub-horizontal extension direction that trends NE. Phase 2 shows a sub-horizontal shortening direction that trends NW. Most of the faults identified in the field as “A” are included in phase 1 and the extension direction is similar to extension directions determined from GPS and earthquake focal mechanisms. Phase 2 contains most of the field-identified “B” faults and the shortening direction is parallel to a previously recognized stretching lineation associated with slaty cleavage development. The phase 1 normal faults are interpreted to be part of a regional-scale east-side-down shear zone based on the leveling and earthquake data and on a topographic lineament that can be traced 11 km to the north near Jia-Ming Lake and the crest of the Central Range.",

We report on the statistical properties of Terrestrial Hectometric Radiation (THR), MF/HF auroral radio emissions emanating from the topside ionosphere, using a long-term data set obtained from the Plasma Waves and Sounder (PWS) experiment mounted on the Akebono satellite during 2 solar cycles. THR typically occurs in either or both of two frequency bands near 1.5–2.0 MHz and 3.0–4.0 MHz, whose polarization features correspond to the L-O and R-X mode. Statistical studies using the Akebono/PWS data reveal clear bimodality in the frequency distribution of THR with two broad peaks near 1.6 MHz and 3.6 MHz and the spatial distribution of occurrence rate of THR-L (lower than 2.5 MHz) and THR-H (higher than 2.5 MHz). In the morning to postnoon sectors (3h-15h MLT), the spatial distribution of both types of THR is confined to magnetic latitudes higher than 70 deg, while during nighttime (15h-3h MLT) it spreads to lower magnetic latitudes (~ 30 deg) at higher altitudes. The explanation of this distribution is that THR is generated in the night-side auroral latitudes near 1000-km altitude and propagation effect makes an emission cone. Occurrence rate of THR-L is higher than that of THR-H. The long-term Akebono/PWS data also show clear solar activity dependence and seasonal variations of THR appearance; THR occurrence rate drops from a few percent during solar maxima to 0.1 percent or less during solar minima and is the highest in summer and the lowest in winter.",

            "abstract": "Coastal wetlands, including salt marshes, are considered to be large carbon sinks. Yet, there is little knowledge about how the terrain and land cover of these environments are related to carbon distribution. An understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of carbon held in both the biomass and soil, and the factors that influence its distribution, will be necessary to allow coastal managers to initiate and verify “Blue Carbon” projects. In this study, we attempt to understand: 1) the temporal changes in salt marsh distributions as affected by marsh submergence, vertical accretion and land cover conversions; 2) patterns of soil carbon across different depths of the soil profile; and 3) to evaluate how changes in relative water level governs the spatial and temporal variability of salt marsh carbon storage ability. Our results indicate that over the study period (1954 to present) a considerable portion of salt marsh extents were submerged, while at the higher terrains these salt marshes indicated a landward shift in response to the sea level rise. Soil carbon measured in the soil profile, revealed a gradual depletion of soil carbon with depth. However, both the soil bulk density and the percent carbon indicated an abrupt and significant change at a depth of 15cm (p=0.05), which we interpreted as distinct of two different environments. As evidenced by historical aerial imagery (1954, 1969), the first (15-30 cm depth) coincided with an unvegetated salt flat at the sample locations, which were then overlain by lower bulk density and higher carbon Spartina alterniflora low marsh (0-15 cm depth) that migrated upslope in response to rapid relative sea level rise. However, within each of these two environments separately, carbon distribution followed a unique pattern with respect to elevation. Our results further point to two different processes, each acting at a different time scale (daily tides versus relative sea level rise), and each results in distinct spatial patterns of carbon deposition with respect to elevation. Thus, local and regional Blue Carbon projects or management actions, and global scale accounting of soil carbon, will need to consider both elevation and sea level history to predict carbon distribution.",

These problems will be complex, and will require leaders well-versed in interdisciplinary learning and international understanding. To employ a multi-disciplinary approach to studying the impact climate change is having in the world in which we live, a team of 57 Western Kentucky University (WKU) faculty, staff, and students participated in a study abroad program to seven ports in the North Sea and North Atlantic, including three ports in Iceland, onboard the Semester at Sea ship, MV Explorer. This program combined interdisciplinary learning, service learning, and international understanding toward the goal of preparing the leaders of tomorrow with the skills to address climate change challenges. Together, the group learned how climate change affects the world from varied academic perspectives, and how more often than not these perspectives are closely interrelated. Courses taught during the experience related to climate change science and communication, economics, future trends, and K-12 education. Each student also participated in a The $100 Solution™ service-learning course. While in port, each class engaged in a discipline-specific activities related to the climate change topic, while at sea students participated in class lectures, engaged in shipboard lectures by international experts in their respective fields, and participated in conversations with lifelong learners onboard the ship. A culminating point of the study abroad experience was a presentation by the WKU students to over 100 persons from the University of Akureyri in Akureyri, Iceland, representatives of neighboring Icelandic communities, environmental agencies, and tourism bureaus about what they had learned about climate change during their travels. By forging this relationship, students were able to share their knowledge, which in turn gave them a deeper understanding of the issues they were learning throughout the voyage.",

The CZ science community takes as its charge the effort to integrate theory, models and data from the multitude of disciplines collectively studying processes on the Earth's surface. The central scientific challenge of the CZ science community is to develop a “grand unifying theory” of the critical zone through a theory-model-data fusion approach, for which the key missing need is a cyberinfrastructure for seamless 4D visual exploration of the integrated knowledge (data, model outputs and interpolations) from all the bio and geoscience disciplines relevant to critical zone structure and function, similar to today’s ability to easily explore historical satellite imagery and photographs of the earth’s surface using Google Earth. This project takes the first “BiG” steps toward answering that need.\nThe overall goal of this project is to co-develop with the CZ science and broader community, including natural resource managers and stakeholders, a web-based integration and visualization environment for joint analysis of cross-scale bio and geoscience processes in the critical zone (BiG CZ), spanning experimental and observational designs. We will: (1) Engage the CZ and broader community to co-develop and deploy the BiG CZ software stack; (2) Develop the BiG CZ Portal web application for intuitive, high-performance map-based discovery, visualization, access and publication of data by scientists, resource managers, educators and the general public; (3) Develop the BiG CZ Toolbox to enable cyber-savvy CZ scientists to access BiG CZ Application Programming Interfaces (APIs); and (4) Develop the BiG CZ Central software stack to bridge data systems developed for multiple critical zone domains into a single metadata catalog. The entire BiG CZ Software system is being developed on public repositories as a modular suite of open source software projects. It will be built around a new Observations Data Model Version 2.0 (ODM2) that has been developed by members of the BiG CZ project team, with community input, under separate funding.",

            "abstract": "We used a receiver function technique for imaging western Mexico, a unique area with several active seismic and volcanic zones like the triple junction of Rivera, Cocos and North American plates and the Colima volcano complex (CVC), the most active in Mexico. Clear images of the distribution of the crust and the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary are obtained using P-to-S receiver functions (RF) from around ~80 broadband stations recorded by the Mapping the Rivera Subduction Zone (MARS), the Colima Volcano Deep Seismic Experiment (CODEX) and a local network (RESCO) that allowed us to considerably increase the teleseismic database used in the project. For imaging, we constructed several 2-D profiles of depth transformed RFs to delineate the seismic discontinuities of the region. Low seismic velocities associated with the Michoacan-Guanajuato and the Mascota-Ayutla-Tapalpa volcanic fields are also observed. Most impressive, a large and well delineated magma body 100 km underneath CVC is recognized along a surely related depression of the moho discontinuity just above it. We bring more tools for a better understanding of the deep processes that ultimately control eruptive behavior in the region.",

            "abstract": "The global rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration enhances the rate at which vegetation can capture carbon through photosynthesis relative to the rate of water lost through transpiration. For arid environments, where the main limit to growth is the supply of water, this ‘fertilisation’ effect is expected to enhance overall vegetation cover and carbon capture, but there is no clear consensus on how the water cycle will be affected. Here, we present a simple model of how vegetation cover and carbon and water fluxes change with CO2 concentration, and we predict the historical (1982-2010) changes in these across the globe’s warm, dry environments. We test this model using concurrent satellite-derived vegetation cover data, processed to separate the CO2-driven changes in cover from changes associated with other dominant drivers (namely, precipitation and disturbances). For the 14% rise in CO2 concentration over the study period, our model predicted a 5-10% rise in vegetation cover which was confirmed by satellite observations that showed an 11% rise in cover. We discuss the implications of this work on catchment vegetation structure and carbon and water fluxes.",

Laser/radar altimetry and stereo analyses have been widely used for this purpose and achieve high quality 3D topographic data over various planetary surfaces such as Venus, Mercury, Moon and Mars. However, in contrast with inner planet and satellite, the base data sets to compose digital topography over outer planets and satellites are very limited.\nTitan, the largest satellite of Saturn has also too limited data inventory to achieve sufficient spatial resolution in topographic data, in spite of increasing interests about the detailed topography owing to the recent interesting discoveries on methane fluvial system, aeolian geomorphologies and possible tectonic activity.\nTherefore the endeavours to increase the coverage of digital topography employing radargrammetry (Kirk et al. 2009), radar altimetry (Elachi, et al. 2005) and SARtopo (Stiles et al. 2009) have been actively conducted. Although these efforts result in the construction of a global topographic map, the consequent spatial resolutions of global topography are still poor (Lorentz et al. 2013).\nIn this study, we tried to improve the coverage and the quality of Titan digital terrain model employing approaches as follows; 1) A semi-automated stereo matching scheme manipulating low signal-to-noise SAR image pair incorporating adaptive filtering and base topography, 2) the geodetic control improvement of stereo SAR pair based on altimetric measurements, 3) introduction of radarclinometry to refine the topography from stereo analyses. Especially together with the technical improvements to exploit SAR stereo pair, the possibility to mine height information from Visual Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) was actively explored by the means of hybrid stereogrammetry between VIMS and SAR image pairs and photoclinometry. The developed scheme was applied for a few testing areas especially over Xanadu which is the largest topographic feature over Titan and well covered by SAR and VIMS. The constructed topography revealed many interesting geomorphic features such as drainage networks and rugged terrains in detail. To fully demonstrate the potential of these approaches, technical details will be continuously improved.",

While it is of key scientific importance to generate high-resolution spatial and temporal data for a range of environmental measurements, it is equally crucial to make sure that the data being generated are of a high quality and free from errors due to human operation, environmental conditions, and other accidental occurrences. Here we discuss our vision for developing a smart sensor network which could be used in monitoring field data for near real-time flagging of the data according to quality indicators. A smart sensor network would add assurance metrics to data gathered from sensors in harsh environments (e.g. Arctic, boreal, and tropics) and promote intelligent archiving. Field operations come with a high cost, and improved processes could significantly improve data quality and reduce overall operational outlays. We discuss plans to monitor the range of data collected from different sensors in the field and generate quality metadata in near real-time to reduce the cost of field operations and minimize uncertainties in error propagation due to poor quality data, field operation, etc. Our work will have implications for field research programs and other data-intensive monitoring systems.",

In order to better characterize drivers of this process, this study quantifies: a) emissions of carbon dioxide and methane from a semi-arid, high plains riverine system with montaine headwaters in order to establish baseline data for the watershed; b) the impact of stream order, seasonality and elevation on dissolved gas concentrations to better understand the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of dissolved carbon gases. To achieve the latter objective, we conducted field surveys in first and second order streams in the Clear Creek drainage of the Powder River Basin watershed. We took direct measurements of stream gases using headspace sampling at thirty sites along an elevation gradient ranging from 1,203-3,346 meters. We also intensely monitored five transects throughout the descending limb of spring runoff (June 8th-August 12th) to investigate how temperature and discharge volume impact greenhouse gas concentrations. Clear Creek, located in northeastern Wyoming, is approximately 118.4 km long with a drainage area of 2,968 km2. The creek flows east out of Bighorn National Forest where it turns northeast to converge with the Powder River about ten miles before the Montana border. The stream straddles the Middle Rockies and Northwestern Great Plains ecoregions and experiences an abrupt shift in soil type, riparian vegetation, underlying geology and stream geometry as the stream exits the mountains and enters the agricultural alluvial floodplain. These site specific biological and physical changes along the elevation gradient affect dissolved greenhouse gas concentrations.",

The purpose of this endeavor was to obtain data and perform analyses that would elucidate our understanding of the evolution of fine mineral aerosol dust during transport across the tropical North Atlantic. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive x-ray scattering (EDX) spectrometer was used to examine the morphological characteristic and surface chemical composition of the individual particles obtained in the AEROSE samples. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to determine relationships between the size distribution, element enrichment, and atmospheric lifetime. The source regions of the individual events were determined using a combination of satellite image analysis, back-trajectory modeling, and analysis of global forecast models.",

            "abstract": "We present recent spectropolarimetric observations of eleven B- and C-type asteroids using SPOL (http://james.as.arizona.edu/~psmith/SPOL/) at the 2.3-m Bok and 1.6-m Kuiper telescopes. Our primary goal is to further constrain our understanding of the wavelength dependence of linear polarization. For each object, we produced polarimetric phase curves (linear polarization vs. phase angle) and measure the wavelength dependence in each observation by calculating the slope of each polarization spectrum. Previous analysis by Belskaya et al. (2009) shows that the slope of the polarization spectrum increases as the wavelength increases. No analysis of the wavelength dependence in B-types has occurred previously to our knowledge. For the five C-type (3 Ch- and 2 C-) objects observed, those of the Ch-type have larger minimum polarizations than of the C- subtype. This is consistent with polarimetric phase curves of similar asteroids by Gil-Hutton and Cañada-Assandri (2012). With respect to the wavelength dependence, our observed targets show an increase in polarization slope with wavelength, confirming the Belskaya (2009) result. After dividing the data by group, C- subtype objects have relatively flat polarization spectra, as opposed to the Ch- subtypes that have more rapidly changing slopes as phase angle increases. A mineralogical basis for the variety of wavelength dependences observed is most likely. Additional observations of the other C- subtypes will aid to distinguish how mineralogical variation affects polarization. It may also explain the wide range of polarization slopes measured near a phase angle of ten degrees in the Belskaya (2009) analysis. Six B-type asteroids were observed in a similar manner. As with the C-types, the polarimetric phase curves vary in shape, suggesting differences in albedo. Also, the wavelength dependence increases with wavelength, as shown for the C-types. On the other hand, all of the B-type objects have a similar wavelength dependence trend with phase angle regardless of its polarization curve; there is a steady increase in polarization slope with phase angle for all objects. Results such as these will hopefully provide additional constraints to theoretical work related to regolith scattering processes.",

            "abstract": "Coral reefs provide many ecosystem services of which coastal populations are especially dependent upon, both in cases of extreme events and in daily life. However, adaptation to climate change is still relatively unknown territory regarding the ecosystem services provided by coastal environments, such as coral reefs. Management strategies usually consider climate change as a distant issue and rarely include ecosystem services in decision-making. Coral reefs are among the most vulnerable environments to climate change, considering the impact that increased ocean temperature and acidity have on the organisms that compose this ecosystem. If no actions are taken, the most likely scenario to occur will be of extreme decline in the ecosystem services provided by coral reefs. Loss of biodiversity due to the pressures of ocean warming and acidification will lead to increased price of seafood products, negative impact on food security, and ecological imbalances. Also, sea-level rise and fragile structures due to carbonate dissolution will increase vulnerability to storms, which can lead to shoreline erosion and ultimately threaten coastal communities. Both these conditions will undoubtedly affect recreation and tourism, which are often the most important use values in the case of coral reef systems. Adaptation strategies to climate change must take on an ecosystem-based approach with continuous monitoring programs, so that multiple ecosystem services are considered and not only retrospective trends are analyzed. Brazilian coral reefs have been monitored on a regular basis since 2000 and, considering that these marginal coral reefs of the eastern Atlantic are naturally under stressful conditions (e.g. high sedimentation rates), inshore reefs of Brazil, such as those in Tinharé-Boipeba, have shown lower vitality rates due to greater impacts from the proximity to the coastal area (e.g. pollution, overfishing, sediment run-off). This chronic negative impact must be addressed to increase resilience and guarantee the adaptation of this ecosystem to climate change. Thus, considering that the majority of the marine ecosystem services we benefit from are provided from coastal habitats, of which coral reefs play an important role, the challenge at hand is in fact the interaction between local factors and climate change",

The hydrologic model calibration literature shows that many bi-objective calibration problems with a proper setup result in such Pareto fronts. The CHC selection approach identifies a subset of archived non-dominated solutions whose map in the objective space forms convex approximation of the Pareto front. The optimization algorithm can sample solely from these solutions to more accurately approximate the convex shape of the Pareto front.\nIt is empirically demonstrated that CHC improves the performance of Pareto Archived Dynamically Dimensioned Search (PA-DDS) when solving MO problems with convex Pareto fronts. This conclusion is based on the results of several benchmark mathematical problems and several hydrologic model calibration problems with two or three objective functions. The impact of CHC on PA-DDS performance is most evident when the computational budget is somewhat limited. It is also demonstrated that 1,000 solution evaluations (limited budget in this study) is sufficient for PA-DDS with CHC-based selection to achieve very high quality calibration results relative to the results achieved after 10,000 solution evaluations.",

            "abstract": "Degradation in drylands is often triggered by shifts induced by feedbacks between coevolving hydrology, vegetation, soils and geomorphic processes. These feedbacks affect the redistribution of surface runoff and therefore the emergent patterns of vegetation and landscape connectivity. Existing theories explaining ecohydrology shifts in semiarid areas with patchy vegetation focus on biomass-water interactions but do not explicitly account for feedbacks with evolving landform and soil depths. Here we study the observed ecohydrologic response of patchy semiarid areas in Australia and Spain, analysing interactions between PFTs traits and landform processes.\nWe further use a mechanistic modelling framework to investigate the role of coevolving soil depths on the stability and resilience of these systems. We find that areas with deeper soils tend to display more regular vegetation patterns and their resilience and recovery after an initial disturbance are strongly affected by plant facilitation strategies. However for ecosystems in steep areas, feedback effects with landforms become stronger, and sudden changes in connectivity can easily lead to degradation. In contrast, we show that for shallow soils, plant facilitation effects become less important and vegetation patterns are irregular. In this case, soil depth becomes the key factor prescribing surface connectivity and recovery of the system after disturbance. These results have critical implications for effective management and restoration efforts, and for understanding the effects of changes in climate and land use.",

            "abstract": "Variation in plant species traits, such as photosynthetic and hydraulic properties, can indicate vulnerability or resilience to climate change, and feed back to broad-scale spatial and temporal patterns in biogeochemistry, demographics, and biogeography. Yet, predicting how vegetation will respond to future environmental changes is severely limited by the inability of our models to represent species-level trait variation in processes and properties, as current generation process-based models are mostly based on the generalized and abstracted concept of plant functional types (PFTs) which were originally developed for hydrological modeling. For example, there are close to 11,000 grass species, but most vegetation models have only a single C4 grass and one or two C3 grass PFTs. However, while species trait databases are expanding rapidly, they have been produced mostly from unstructured research, with a focus on easily researched traits that are not necessarily the most important for determining plant function. Additionally, implementing realistic species-level trait variation in models is challenging. Combining related and ecologically similar species in these models might ameliorate this limitation. Here we argue for an intermediate, lineage-based approach to PFTs, which draws upon recent advances in gene sequencing and phylogenetic modeling, and where trait complex variations and anatomical features are constrained by a shared evolutionary history. We provide an example of this approach with grass lineages that vary in photosynthetic pathway (C3 or C4) and other functional and structural traits. We use machine learning approaches and geospatial databases to infer the most important environmental controls and climate niche variation for the distribution of grass lineages, and utilize a rapidly expanding grass trait database to demonstrate examples of lineage-based grass PFTs. For example, grasses in the Andropogoneae are typically tall species that dominate wet and seasonally burned ecosystems, whereas Chloridoideae grasses are associated with semi-arid regions.

            "abstract": "Augustine Volcano, a small island volcano located in Cook Inlet, Alaska has produced approximately 11 flank-failure debris-avalanches over the last 2,000 yrs (BP) that were large enough to reach the coast of the island and enter the sea. Each debris avalanche conceivably could have triggered a tsunami. In 1883, a tsunami generated by an eruption and flank-failure of Augustine inundated the indigenous Alaskan village of Nanwalek (previously English Bay) with 8 meters of runup. Nanwalek is geographically located atop a coastal headland on the southwest coast of the Kenai Peninsula approximately 85 kilometers due east of Augustine (Beget et al., 2008). Current research in Nanwalek is focused on describing a peat exposure situated on the shoreward edge of the English Bay headland. We present new data from this locality on the sedimentology, tephrochronology, radiocarbon dating, and field stratigraphy. The exposure is basally dated to approximately 7,100 yr BP and includes exotic units of volcanic ash, sand, and gravel. We correlate 19 tephra layers to late Holocene eruptions of Augustine and several Cook Inlet and northern Alaska Peninsula volcanoes. We interpret the non-volcanic clastic sediment horizons in the peat as prehistoric tsunami-inundation events of the English Bay headland. Augustine volcanic-ash deposits found within the tsunami deposits allow correlation to prehistoric coeval flank-failure debris-avalanche deposits exposed on Augustine (Waitt and Beget, 2009). We correlate three tsunami deposits associated with Augustine tephra marker horizons H, I, and G of Waitt and Beget (2009) each of which were erupted approximately 1,400 yr BP, 1,700 yr BP, and 2,100 yr BP. Additionally, we present new tephra and sedimentological evidence for a 4,100 yr BP paleo-tsunami inundation event at Nanwalek that we correlate to a previously unidentified flank-failure debris-avalanche event at Augustine Volcano. The recognition of this new deposit extends the age record for flank-failure events of Augustine Volcano by approximately 2,000 years.",

            "abstract": "Previous paleomagnetic study of the Orosirian (2050-1800 Ma) Great Slave Supergroup, well exposed on islands in Great Slave Lake on the southeastern margin of the Slave craton, revealed evidence of a regularly reversing, or oscillatory, apparent polar wander path. The paleogeographic utility of paleopoles from the Great Slave Supergroup has been brought into question owing to the possibility of vertical-axis rotations associated with the McDonald transcurrent fault array, but structural corrections can be applied. In a high-resolution paleomagnetic re-sampling of portions of the Great Slave Supergroup, concentrating on the Pethei and Christie Bay Groups in particular, we demonstrate systematic and correlative shifts in declination within structurally uniform homoclinal sections. Positive fold tests further substantiate the primary nature of the paleomagnetic oscillations. Smooth, albeit rapid, declination changes preserved within and between our Great Slave Supergroup sections cannot be trivially explained by structural rotation. True polar wander oscillations (expressed as declination variation locally) may be used to correlate Orosirian strata regionally and globally. Geochronological refinement of the Great Slave Supergroup, both directly and indirectly, should help facilitate any such correlations and those with intrusive rocks both locally and globally. Unconformably overlain by the Et-Then Group that is contemporaneous with the McDonald Fault system, the Great Slave basin and intrusive Compton laccoliths pre-date transcurrent faulting. Increased precision achieved using modern U-Pb (zircon) geochronologic methods on the ca. 1865 Ma Compton laccoliths calibrates the minimum age constraint for Great Slave deposition. Additionally, magnetic susceptibility of a ~350 m-thick section of the Pethei Group reveals a hierarchy of cycles. If interpreted as astronomical cycles, possibly expressed through the effects of insolation on biogenic carbonate precipitation relative to continental siliciclastic export, sediment accumulation rates could be constrained for the Pethei carbonates. Such age constraints have implications for maximum rates of true polar wander in Paleoproterozoic time, which is linked through mantle viscosity to the secular cooling of Earth.",

            "abstract": "A partial analog for future global change is the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum—a transient episode of warming, acidification, and biogeographic change at ~55.5 Ma. The PETM is known to have triggered extinction in some deep sea biotas, extensive biogeographic range shifts, and the common occurrence of ‘excursion biotas’—non-analog occurrences of species that are typically rare in the open ocean before or after the PETM. Here we report on the impact of the PETM on fish production and biodiversity. Our data include the mass accumulation rate of fish teeth and denticles as well as an analysis of tooth morphotypes for three PETM sites: ODP 1220 and 1209 in the Pacific, and ODP 1260 in the equatorial Atlantic. Tooth morphotypes hardly change through the PETM and consist of abundant midwater species (angler fish and flashlight fish) in addition to sharks and epipelagic fish. There is no evidence for a non-analog ‘excursion biota’ during the PETM, suggesting that fish experienced fewer geographic range shifts than the calcareous and organic-walled plankton where excursion biotas are commonplace. Fish mass accumulation rates are also relatively stable before and after the PETM although all sites show a transient rise in fish production at the onset of the PETM or within the later part of the “PETM Core”. These results broadly match published estimates of PETM export production from biogenic barium fluxes. Our findings run counter to “Future Earth” models that use climate forecasts for the next century to predict the impact of global change on fish stocks. These models suggest that future warming and ocean stratification will decrease most tropical and subtropical ocean fish production, accentuate fish production in the boundary currents and generally shift production toward higher latitudes. A resolution of “Future Earth” models and PETM data may reflect the different timescales of observation and stages of ecological response to severe global change.",

The sections cover the period between 2008 and 2013. The tracers are interpreted in the context of circulation patterns and mean residence times of the main water masses. Mixed layer tracer ages range from close to zero to ca. 5 years with most of the ages grouping around 2.5 years. The tracer ages increase rapidly through the halocline waters (roughly 10 years at about 100 and 20 years close to 200 meters depth, respectively) and typically reach their maximum values close to the depth of the core of the Atlantic Water (up to 35 years). Within the AW there are large lateral gradients with higher ages found in the boundary current along the slope of the Canadian Archipelago, and lower ages prevalent close to the North Pole. We also observe temporal variability in the age tracer distributions, mainly in the lateral gradient of the ages in the AW layer. We discuss the age tracer results in the context of the circulation and mean residence times of waters in the Switchyard region of the Arctic Ocean and their variability. We also discuss possible systematic differences between the Tritium/He-3 and SF6 ages and their relevance for our main conclusions.",

            "abstract": "Bias correction of meteorological variables from climate model simulations is a routine strategy for circumventing known limitations of state-of-the-art general circulation models. Although the assessment of climate change impacts often depends on the joint variability of multiple variables, commonly used bias correction methodologies treat each variable independently, and do not consider the relationship among variables. Independent bias correction can therefore produce non-physical corrections and may fail to capture important multivariate relationships. Here, we introduce a joint bias correction methodology (JBC) and apply it to precipitation (P) and temperature (T) fields from the CMIP5 model ensemble. This approach is based on a general bivariate distribution of P-T, and can be seen as a multivariate extension of the commonly used univariate quantile mapping method. It proceeds by correcting either P or T first and then correcting the other variable conditional upon the first one, both following the concept of the univariate quantile mapping. JBC is shown to reduce model-simulated biases in P-T correlation fields, as well as biases in the mean and variance of P and T. In addition, it overcomes a noted problem with an existing joint P-T correction method, namely that this earlier approach did not yield appreciable improvements in P-T correlation coefficients. JBC, using methods such as the one presented here, thus represents an important step in impacts-based research as it explicitly accounts for inter-variable relationships as part of the bias correction procedure, thereby improving not only the individual distributions of P and T, but critically, their joint distribution.",

            "abstract": "Ocean color analysis is more challenging for coastal regions than the global ocean due the effects of optical brightness, shallow and turbid water, higher phytoplankton growth rates, and the complex geometry of coastal bays and estuaries. Also, one of the key atmospheric correction assumptions (zero water leaving radiance in the near infrared) is not valid for these complex conditions. This makes it difficult to estimate the spectral radiance noise caused by atmospheric aerosols, which can vary rapidly with time and space.\nThis project evaluated using Landsat-7 ETM+ observations over a set of coastal bays, and allowing atmospheric correction calculations to vary with time and location as much as practical. Precise satellite orbit vector data was combined with operational weather and climate data to create interpolated arrays of atmospheric profiles which varied with time and location, allowing separate calculation of the Rayleigh and aerosol radiance corrections for all pixels. The resulting normalized water-leaving radiance values were compared with chlorophyll fluorescence measurements made at five in-situ stations inside a set of Texas coastal bays: the Mission-Aransas National Estuarine Research Reserve.\nCurve-fitting analysis showed it was possible to estimate chlorophyll surface area concentrations by using ETM+ water-leaving radiance values and a third-order polynomial equation. Two pairs of ETM+ bands were identified as inputs (Bands 1 and 3, and the Log10 values of Bands 3 and 4), both achieving R2 of 0.69. Additional research efforts were recommended to obtain additional data, identify better curve fitting equations, and potentially extend the radiative transfer model into the water column.",

            "abstract": "Globally, organic soils and peats may store as much as 600 Gt of terrestrial carbon, representing 20 – 30% of the planet’s terrestrial organic carbon mass. This is approximately the same carbon mass as that contained in Earth’s atmosphere, despite peatlands occupying only 3% of its surface. Effects of fires in these ecosystems are of global concern due to their potential for enormous carbon release into the atmosphere. The implications for contributions of peat fires to the global carbon cycle and radiative forcing scenarios are significant. Combustion of peat mostly takes place in the low temperature, smoldering phase of a fire. It consumes carbon that may have accumulated over a period of hundreds to thousands of years. In comparison, combustion of aboveground biomass fuels releases carbon that has accumulated much more recently, generally over a period of years or decades. Here, we report our findings on characterization of emissions from laboratory combustion of peat soils from three locations representing the biomes in which these soils occur. Peat samples from Alaska and Florida (USA) and Siberia (Russia) were burned at two different fuel moisture levels. Burns were conducted in an 8-m3 volume combustion chamber located at the Desert Research Institute, Reno, NV, USA. We report significant brown carbon production from combustion of all three peat soils. We used a multispectral (405, 532, 781 nm) photoacoustic instrument equipped with integrating nephelometer to measure the wavelength-dependent aerosol light absorption and scattering. Absorption Ångström exponents (between 405 and 532 nm) as high as ten were observed, revealing strongly enhanced aerosol light absorption in the violet and blue wavelengths. Single scattering albedos (SSA) of 0.94 and 0.99 were observed at 405 and 532 nm, respectively, for the same sample. Variability of these optical parameters will be discussed as a function of fuel and combustion conditions. Other real-time measurements included CO2, CO, NOx (NO and NO2), and SO2 concentrations, PM size-distributions, and PM and black carbon mass concentrations. In addition, Teflon-membrane, quartz-fiber, and Teflon-impregnated glass fiber (TIGF) filters followed by XAD-4 cartridges were collected for detailed chemical analysis.",

            "abstract": "Pool-riffle sequences are a common geomorphological meso-bedform in many streams, which provide important habitat diversity both in terms of flow and substrate. The conditions for their formation and self-maintenance are often site-specific and but it can be postulated that a combination of three mechanisms, namely stage-dependent flow conditions, three-dimensional flow patterns and selective sediment transport, can explain the resilience and ubiquity of pool-riffle sequences observed in the field. In this paper, we analyse the importance of these three mechanisms using different combinations of stage-dependent three-dimensional flow patterns in pool-riffle sequences and sediment size distributions obtained in both pools and riffles. Self-maintenance mechanisms are identified by evaluating erosional or depositional tendencies in pools and riffles for different flow conditions using local values of bed shear stress and their corresponding fractional sediment transport volumes. Self-maintenance is directly linked to episodes of pool erosion and riffle deposition and we use the term sediment transport reversal rates to indicate this situation, rather than velocity reversal or shear stress reversal that only consider flow variables. This approach allows us to compare, for the first time, the relative importance of each of the mechanisms and their role in the self-maintenance of these bedforms. Computations are performed using existing field, laboratory and numerical simulation data from several study sites. We discuss the limitations of our approach and the extensions to more complex field cases. We also analyse the implications for downscaled laboratory experiments.",

            "abstract": "Modern microbial mats are commonly used as analogs for understanding early ecosystem evolution. A primary feature of benthic ecosystems is the fixation of CO2 in the photic zone and transfer and/or mineralization of organic carbon through a diverse tropic structure. Generally, the resulting δ13C values for organic matter relative to DIC is small which indicates that these mats are CO2-limited. Microcoleus mat flux measurements indicate that small amounts of CO2 fixed during the day are lost to the overlying water at night as C13-enriched DIC (Des Marais and Canfield 1994). This loss results in depletion in mat organic matter and is thought to occur as a result of remineralized DIC fixation by chemo- and/or photoautotrophs.\nWe have examined the fate of fixed carbon in hypersaline mats by analysis of the stable C-isotopes of bulk organic carbon and lipid compounds in a laminated-Microcoleus mat (90 ‰, pH 8.6) and in a gypsum-endoevaporitic, Halothece mat (163‰, pH 7.4). In the surface photic zone of Microcoleus mat, the δ13C TOC was –10.0 ‰ with membrane fatty acids (i-15, n-16, n-18, cy-19) ranging from –17.2 to –18.0‰. Cyanobacterial alkanes were similarly depleted (n-17 = –19.5‰). Eurkaryotic sterols and bacterial hopanoids were somewhat enriched with δ13C values ~–15‰. For Microcoleus mat, little variation occurred over 70 mm of core depth. The TOC and FA values for surface, endoevaporitic Halothece mat were generally similar to those of Microcoleus. However, below the surface gypsum crust, discrimination increased. Mass balance calculations for surface FA = –18.5‰ while the FA from layers below the crust = –25.2‰. The δ13C values for cyanobacterial alkanes (~–20‰) were similar from all layers while hopanoids from below crust were slightly depleted relative to those from surface. An apparent increased discrimination during fixation of remineralized DIC presumably by anoxygenic phototrophs present below the surface gypsum crust (Jahnke et al. 2014) resulted in a dramatic C13-depletion to TOC and associated lipid biomarkers.",

The modeling results showed that the change of NO emission rate, planetary boundary layer height and dry deposition velocity could not explain the delayed concentration peak of H2O2 at urban Beijing. When the aqueous reaction between H2O2 and organics was added in the model, there was a better agreement between the modeled and observed phenomena. Combining the detection of hydroxymethyl hydroperoxide (HOCH2OOH) observed during the nighttime at urban Beijing, we proposed that the aqueous phase reaction between H2O2 and organics on aerosols caused the delayed concentration peak of H2O2 at urban Beijing.",

            "abstract": "The Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) is the dominant atmospheric circulation in the tropics on intraseasonal timescales. The MJO often couples with convection as it moves over the Indian Ocean and decouples as it leaves the west Pacific Ocean. The association between convection coupled to the MJO and the midlatitude flow pattern has been the primary focus of numerous recent studies. In particular, it has been shown that there is a statistical relationship between the position and strength of the MJO and anticyclonic wavebreaking (AWB). This study expands on this statistical relationship and examines the physical mechanisms by which the MJO is able to induce AWB.\nWe have constructed a climatology of AWB events during the boreal cold season from 1979 through 2010 over the North Pacific. The subset of the AWB events that are associated with the MJO is used as the basis of this study. Composite analyses will be shown to highlight the large-scale, high amplitude features associated with the MJO and AWB.\nIt will be shown that convection associated with the MJO and convectively coupled Kelvin Waves over the Indian Ocean creates middle tropospheric heating anomalies near the equator, which reduce upper-tropospheric PV across the low latitudes. This process tightens the pre-existing climatologically located meridional PV gradient at the periphery of the tropics. The meridional PV gradient is proportional to the Rossby wave restoring force, and as Rossby waves propagate eastward from the region of stronger to the region of weaker meridional PV gradient, they encounter an insufficient restoring force, causing them to break. The location of the breaking point depends on the strength and zonal extent of the meridional PV gradient as well as the strength and location of the MJO.\nSince the MJO is often used as the basis of intraseasonal forecasts, it is important to understand how AWB can affect the relationship between the MJO and sensible weather over North America. It will be shown that MJO events with AWB over the North Pacific affect the temperature and precipitation patterns over North America differently than MJO events without AWB.",

The observations from nonscanner at satellite altitude are converted to TOA flux by inversion processes, which involve applying so-called shape factors. However, the nonscanner processing used only one partly cloudy scene type to determine the shape factor. In addition, it does not consider spectral dependent shortwave filter degradation. Based on knowledge from recent developments in the CERES process, we propose to revise inversion processes for ERBS, NOAA9, and NoAA10 WFOV nonscanners. We will consider spectral dependent degradation of the shortwave filter transmissivity and apply scene type dependent shape factors. In the proposed inversion process, we will use imager derived cloud fraction to identify the scene type over the field of view of nonscanner instruments. In this presentation, we will present proposed inversion processes and some preliminary results.",

            "abstract": "Interacting with hearing impaired students who communicate using auditory/oral methods provides challenges and opportunities to education/outreach activities. Despite many advances in assistive technologies, these hearing impaired students will learn much less incidentally than their peers with typical hearing. In other words, they will often require repeated auditory and perhaps visual reinforcement in order to learn a new word or a new concept. This need leads to a much more deliberate and conscious interaction between educators or scientists and the students. We are reporting from a unique joint project between the Sunshine Cottage School for Deaf Children and the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), to bring actual space research to life for hearing impaired elementary school students. During this project, we combined the unique capabilities of Deaf Education educators with the excitement and wonder of researching the northern lights. For three consecutive winters, we conducted a series of informal yet structured activities each year with fourth and fifth grade students. Our interactions went beyond typical classroom activities and readily available educational materials. Our goal was to engage and excite the students. To do so, we set up a series of interactions and mini-projects that introduced the students to actual research and actual researchers. From \"meet the scientists\" visits to school over a field trip to the SwRI space research facilities to observing and predicting the aurora using real-time space weather data, we engaged students in the \"who\" and \"how\" of doing research and field work in Alaska's winter. Over the course of this project, students connected with a remote school in the interior of Alaska, participated in the excitement of a NASA sounding rocket campaign in in Poker Flat, AK, skyped with researchers and students in Alaska, and made aurora predictions using NOAA real time space weather data. The highlight of the program each year was the in-school overnight camp-out in February, where we attempted to observe the aurora occurring real-time in Alaska. In this presentation, we discuss the challenges and lessons learned from this project, focusing particularly on the lessons learned from the hearing impaired students that would directly benefit more typical school settings.",

            "abstract": "Solar wind dynamic pressure pulses (DPPs), i.e. the abrupt change in solar wind dynamic pressure, can affect the energy and momentum transfer from the solar wind to the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling system, and as a result, cause various types of disturbances. To detect the DPPs rapidly from the solar wind plasma data, an automated DPP-hunting computer code is developed. In order to meet the research requirements, it demands not only identify and isolate the special structure, but also automatically select appropriate preceding and succeeding reference data points, for which there are very small variations in solar wind dynamic pressure, to represent the plasma status before and after the pressure change, as well as determine the DPP fine ramp structure where the solar wind transits from one relatively quiet status to another. It indicates from the high-resolution measurements that the pressure changes can occur on time scale from a few seconds to many minutes. The code can be used to hunt DPPs of arbitrary ramp length and arbitrary pressure change amplitude by adjusting the criteria. It can be applied to variable data rates. The strong DPPs that have very large pressure change are most geoeffective so as to affect the near-Earth environment intensively. Thus the code also benefits the space weather warning or forecasting when applied to the real-time spacecraft data to hunt the large DPPs. Here we present the major algorithm to identify and define the upstream, downstream and the ramp region. The effectiveness of this code is tested on WIND high-resolution measurements covering the 23th solar cycle. We will show the test results during the interval of magnetic cloud (MC) and corotating interation region (CIR). The statistical results of DPPs in 23th solar cycle are also discussed.",

            "abstract": "Atmosphere–ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) are useful to simulate large-scale climate evolutions. However, AOGCM data resolution is too coarse for regional and local climate studies. Downscaling techniques have been developed to refine AOGCM data and provide information at more relevant scales especially for hydrological applications. Among a wide range of available approaches, regression-based methods are commonly used for this purpose. When several variables are considered at one or multiple sites, regression models are employed to reproduce the observed climate characteristics at small scale, such as the variability and the relationship between sites and variables. The objective of the present talk is to introduce a probabilistic Gaussian copula regression (PGCR) model for simultaneously downscaling multiple variables at several sites. The proposed PGCR model relies on a probabilistic framework to specify the marginal distribution for each downscaled variable at a given day through AOGCM predictors, and handles multivariate dependence between sites and variables using a Gaussian copula. The proposed model is applied for the downscaling of AOGCM data to daily precipitation and minimum and maximum temperatures in the southern part of Quebec, Canada. In addition, to assess the potential of the proposed method, reanalysis products are used in this study. Results of the study indicate the superiority of the proposed model over classical regression-based methods.",

A relative minimum during the mid-summer, known as the mid-summer drought (MSD) separates the early rainfall season (ERS) from the late rainfall season. Accumulated rainfall totals during the ERS appear as a quasi-stationary rain-belt stretching across the Caribbean from the southwest to the northeast. We place late spring rains in the Caribbean in context of other subtropical convergence zones in order to address the onset and cessation of the ERS while also offering an explanation of a Caribbean rain-belt pattern. Upper tropospheric westerlies, mid-tropospheric positive temperature advection, and moist low level poleward flow are the three primary ingredients that conspire to produce the first peak of the annual bimodal rain signal and the related Caribbean early season rain-belt. The MSD ensues as the primary ingredients weaken across the Caribbean and enhanced rainfall shifts north along the North Atlantic Convergence Zone (NACZ). Seasonal rainfall totals from the ERS through the MSD periods reveal a continuous rain-belt that extends from the Caribbean to the NACZ termed the Caribbean Atlantic Rain-belt (CAR-belt). The Car-belt is present in the long term mean, but has signs of interannual variability.",

All of these developments are resulting in the development and implementation of standards for the formats of metadata, data, data products, quality control methods and flags, common vocabularies. They are also providing services for data discovery, viewing and downloading, and software tools for editing, conversions, communication, analysis and presentation, all of which are increasingly being adopted and used by their national and regional marine communities.The Ocean Data Interoperability Platform (ODIP)project is supported by the EU FP7 Research Infrastructures programme, National Science Foundation (USA) and Australian government and has started 1st October 2012. ODIP includes all the major organisations engaged in ocean data management in EU, US, and Australia. ODIP is also supported by the IOC -IODE, closely linking this activity with its Ocean Data Portal (ODP) and Ocean Data Standards (ODS) projects.\nThe ODIP platform aims to ease interoperability between the regional marine data management infrastructures. Therefore it facilitates an organised dialogue between the key infrastructure representatives by means of publishing best practice, organising international workshops and fostering the development of common standards and interoperability solutions. These are evaluated and tested by means of prototype projects.\nThe ODIP Prototype project 1 aims at establishing interoperability between the regional EU, USA and Australia data discovery and access services (SeaDataNet CDI, US NODC, and IMOS MCP) and contributing to the global GEOSS and IODE-ODP Portals. Use is made of the GEO-DAB brokerage service, which has already proven its merits as part of the GEOSS developments. The presentation will give further information on ODIP, the formulated Prototype projects and the ongoing implementation activities for the ODIP Prototype project 1.",

DSL is often co-emitted with SO2 and NO2, thus it is important to understand the possible effects of SO2 on DSL SOA composition. Additionally, DSL SOA composition can be affected by photochemical aging processes such as photolysis. In this study, DSL SOA was first prepared under dry, high-NOx conditions with various concentrations of SO2 by photooxidation in a smog chamber. The SOA was then stripped of excess oxidants and gaseous organics with a denuder train and the resulting particles were photolyzed at various photolysis times in a quartz flow tube. The SOA composition, photochemical aging, properties, and mass concentration, before and after direct photolysis in the flow tube, were examined using several techniques. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) was performed on DSL SOA samples to investigate the effect of SO2 on molecular level composition. SOA composition as a function of photolysis time was measured with an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS). HR-MS results show that organosulfates are produced in DSL SOA. Both AMS and HR-MS results show that photolysis also has an effect on composition; though, this is more apparent in the HR-MS results than in the AMS results. In summary, both the presence of SO2 and solar radiation has an effect on DSL SOA composition.",

            "abstract": "We study a mechanism of iceberg breakup that may act together with the recognized melt and wave-induced decay processes. Our proposal is based on observations from a recent field experiment on a large ice island in Baffin Bay, East Canada. We observed that successive collapses of the overburden from above an unsupported wavecut at the iceberg waterline created a submerged foot fringing the berg. The buoyancy stresses induced by such a foot may be sufficient to cause moderate-sized bergs to break off from the main berg. A mathematical model is developed to test the feasibility of this mechanism. The results suggest that once the foot reaches a critical length, the induced stresses are sufficient to cause calving. The theoretically predicted maximum stable foot length compares well to the data collected in situ. Further, the model provides analytical expressions for the previously observed ‘rampart-moat’ iceberg surface profiles. Finally, we comment on the implications for the calving of icebergs from shelf fronts, where similar underwater ‘feet’ have been observed.",

In this study, a new copula-based method is proposed for generating long-term multisite monthly and daily streamflow data. A multivariate copula, which is established based on bivariate copulas and conditional probability distributions, is employed to describe temporal dependences (single site) and spatial dependences (between sites). Monthly or daily streamflows at multiple sites are then generated by sampling from the conditional copula. Three tributaries of Colorado River and the upper Yangtze River are selected to evaluate the proposed methodology. Results show that the generated data at both higher and lower time scales can capture the distribution properties of the single site and preserve the spatial correlation of streamflows at different locations. The main advantage of the method is that the model parameters can be easily estimated using Kendall tau rank correlation coefficient, which makes it possible to generate daily streamflow data. The method provides a new tool for multisite stochastic simulation.",

            "abstract": "Communities in the NW arctic rely on subsistence activities such as hunting, fishing and gathering to ensure their food security and to maintain a cultural identity but climate change is altering the timing and distribution of plants and animals. Arctic Alaskan villages are only accessible by air or watercraft thus limiting the options of goods and services and increasing the cost due to vast distances traveled. Additionally, these goods and services must be transported during winter months, which include some of the most extreme temperatures and landscapes people permanently occupy. Many rural community members mitigate these high food prices by maintaining their traditional lifestyle of hunting fishing and gathering of marine mammals, fish, greens and berries.\nThese essential subsistence activities are impacted by a warming arctic as reduced sea ice extent, permafrost thaw, increased storm severity and shifting seasonality alters plant and animal patterns that people in the region have knowledge about for thousands of years. Now with increased weather variability and a changing climate the people in the region are adapting and responding to these changes. Local traditional knowledge (LTK) of active hunters, fishers, and gatherers can provide a deeper and more comprehensive understanding to western science of how climate change is impacting the Arctic. This documentary film captures footage from the summer and fall of 2013 of activities of hunters fishers and gatherers and recorded their sentiments of how climate changes has impacted their subsistence way of life, and how arctic residence are responding to both climate and extreme weather events. Video is taken from the land, sea and air in and around Kotzebue, Kivalina, Point Hope, Noatak, Ambler, Buckland and Deering. The presenters will discuss how the film shows responses to change and how the film was made in close collaboration with NW arctic residents.",

            "abstract": "This paper will address a conundrum that has emerged from recent research on tropical cyclone formation. Composite analyses and case studies suggest that prior to genesis, the atmosphere presents a mid-tropospheric vortex that is strong compared to the cyclonic circulation in the boundary layer. Accompanying this vortex is near saturation from the boundary layer through at least 5 km, sometimes more, and a nearly balanced weak negative temperature anomaly below the vortex and stronger positive temperature anomaly above. This thermodynamic state is one of high moisture but low buoyancy for lifted parcels (i.e. low convective available potential energy). However, observations also suggest that widespread deep convection accompanies genesis, with cloud top temperatures becoming colder near the time of genesis. This is seemingly at odds with in situ observations of thermodynamic characteristics prior to genesis.\nProgress toward understanding the apparent contradiction can be made by realizing that the existence of a moist, relatively stable vortex, and deep convective clouds are not necessarily coincident in space and time. This is demonstrated by a detailed analysis of the two days leading up to the formation of Atlantic tropical cyclone Karl on 14 September. Karl featured a relatively long gestation period characterized initially by a marked misalignment of mid-tropospheric and surface cyclonic circulations. The mid-tropospheric vortex strengthened due to a pulse of convection earlier on 13 September. Meanwhile, the near-surface vortex underwent a precession around the mid-tropospheric vortex as the separation between the two decreased. The eruption of convection around midnight on 14 September, 18 hours prior to declaration on a TC, occurred in the center of the nearly-aligned vortex, contained a mixture of shallow and deep convection and resulted in spin-up over a deep layer, but particularly at the surface. Prior to genesis, the most intense deep convection was located at least 200 km from the center.",

            "abstract": "The physical mechanism responsible for the high temperatures of the solar corona and the solar wind is capable of heating different ion species unequally, resulting in temperatures that are proportional to mass, or even supra-mass proportional. Spectroscopic measurements of coronal ions indicate that these uneven temperatures emerge within tenths of solar radii from the surface of the Sun. It is possible that preferential heating occurs closer to the surface of the Sun, but only at these heights are Coulomb collision rates sufficiently low that different temperatures can persist long enough to be observed. Solar wind ions in interplanetary space are also often seen to have unequal temperatures, but are these differences due to ongoing preferential heating or a signature of a process that occurred much closer to the Sun? This presentation will demonstrate a new technique that uses interplanetary solar wind observations and a model for the effects of Coulomb collisions to solve for the typical outer boundary of preferential ion heating. We will compare our results with theoretical models of solar wind heating, and make predictions for the upcoming Solar Probe Plus and Solar Orbiter missions to the inner heliosphere, namely that Solar Probe Plus will enter a region of the inner heliosphere where all ions, even in slow solar wind, experience preferential heating.",

            "abstract": "Nested within the Halema’uma’u Crater on the summit of Kīlauea Volcano, the active lava lake of Overlook Crater poses hazards to local residents and Hawaii Volcanoes National Park visitors. Since its formation in March 2008, the lava lake has enlarged to +28,500 m2 and has been closely monitored by researchers at the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO). Time-lapse images, collected via visible and thermal infrared cameras, reveal thin crustal plates, separated by incandescent cracks, moving across the lake surface as lava circulates beneath. We hypothesize that changes in size, shape, velocity, and patterns of these crustal plates are related to other eruption processes at the volcano. Here we present a methodology to identify characteristic lava lake surface patterns from thermal infrared video footage using a self-organizing maps (SOM) algorithm. The SOM is an artificial neural network that performs unsupervised clustering and enables us to visualize the relationships between groups of input patterns on a 2-dimensional grid. In a preliminary trial, we input ~4 hours of thermal infrared time-lapse imagery collected on December 16-17, 2013 during a transient deflation-inflation deformation event at a rate of one frame every 10 seconds. During that same time period, we also acquired a series of one-second terrestrial laser scans (TLS) every 30 seconds to provide detailed topography of the lava lake surface. We identified clusters of characteristic thermal patterns using a self-organizing maps algorithm within the Matlab SOM Toolbox. Initial results from two SOMs, one large map (81 nodes) and one small map (9 nodes), indicate 4-6 distinct groups of thermal patterns. We compare these surface patterns with lava lake surface slope and crustal plate velocities derived from concurrent TLS surveys and with time series of other eruption variables, including outgassing rates and inflation-deflation events. This methodology may be applied to the continuous stream of thermal video footage at Kīlauea to expand the breadth of eruption information we are able to obtain from a remote thermal infrared camera and may potentially allow for the recognition of lava lake patterns as a proxy for other eruption parameters.",

            "abstract": "Traditionally, the thermal evolution of the lithosphere is recovered by the interpolation of discrete temperature-time points, generated by assigning estimates of nominal closure temperatures to volume-averaged radiometric ages. Whilst informative, bulk thermochronology potentially fails to yield high-resolution thermal histories capable of revealing short-lived (102—105 years) thermal events associated with advective processes such as magmatism and fluid flow. In this contribution, we show that intragranular concentration profiles of Zr, Hf, Nb and Ta (HFSE’s) in rutile have the potential to record high-resolution thermal history information originating from short-lived tectono-magmatic events occurring at temperatures in excess of 650°C. Numerical modeling shows that the sensitivity of each rutile speedometer to faithfully record high-temperature thermal events is dependent on (i.) the rate of intracrystalline diffusion, (ii.) grain boundary transport, and (iii.) the magnitude of the diffusant partition coefficient. Given the similarity in Arrhenian relations for the element pairs Nb, Ta [1] and Zr, Hf [2] in rutile, observable concentration gradients can be co-inverted to yield a unique combination of both duration and intensity of the thermal event. To illustrate the potential utility of the method we measured Nb, Ta, Zr and Hf concentration profiles from the outer 30 µm of granulite facies rutile (Ivrea Zone, Southern Alps), using LA-ICPMS in depth-profile configuration. Joint inversion of internally-consistent concentration profiles yields a thermal history that is consistent with diffusive uptake of HFSE’s from a grain-boundary fluid phase liberated during a previously unrecognized reheating event. These data confirm that rutile HFSE speedometry provides an underutilised tool to trace transient thermal events in a temperature range directly relevant to the geological evolution of the lower crust.\n[1] Marschall et al.

            "abstract": "Feature layers in the National Map program (TNM) are a fundamental context for much of the data collection and analysis conducted by the USGS and other governmental and nongovernmental organizations. Their computational usefulness, though, has been constrained by the lack of formal relationships besides superposition between TNM layers, as well as limited means of representing how TNM datasets relate to additional attributes, datasets, and activities. In the field of Geospatial Information Science, there has been a growing recognition of the value of semantic representation and technology for addressing these limitations, particularly in the face of burgeoning information volume and heterogeneity. Fundamental to this approach is the development of formal ontologies for concepts related to that information that can be processed computationally to enhance creation and discovery of new geospatial knowledge. They offer a means of making much of the presently innate knowledge about relationships in and between TNM features accessible for machine processing and distributed computation.A full and comprehensive ontology of all knowledge represented by TNM features is still impractical. The work reported here involves elaboration and integration of a number of small ontology design patterns (ODP's) that represent limited, discrete, but commonly accepted and broadly applicable physical theories for the behavior of TNM features representing surface water bodies and landscape surfaces and the connections between them. These ontology components are validated through use in applications for discovery and aggregation of water science observational data associated with National Hydrography Data features, features from the National Elevation Dataset (NED) and Water Boundary Dataset (WBD) that constrain water occurrence in the continental US. These applications emphasize workflows which are difficult or impossible to automate using existing data structures. Evaluation of the usefulness of the developed ontology components includes both solicitation of feedback on prototype applications, and provision of a query / mediation service for feature-linked data to facilitate development of additional third-party applications.",

One concept to enable broad participation by the scientific community is the Mothership of Asteroid CubeSats to deliver third-party experiments and sensors to a near Earth asteroid. The Mothership service includes delivery of nanosats built by a variety of non-DSI researchers, communications relay to Earth, and visuals of the asteroid surface and surrounding area. This service allows researchers to house their instruments in a low-cost nanosat body that does not require the high-performance propulsion or deep space communications capabilities that otherwise would be required for an asteroid mission. This enables organizations with relatively low operating budgets to closely examine an asteroid with highly specialized sensors of their own choosing. In addition, the Mothership and its deployed nanosats can offer a platform for instruments, that need to be distributed over multiple spacecraft. The Mothership would be designed to carry a variety of form factors, from chipsats to 1U to 8U CubeSats. The initial missions would begin as early as fourth quarter 2017 and continue through 2018-19.

            "abstract": "Climate change is projected to cause significant shifts in precipitation patterns across the Amazon basin; yet, there remains considerable uncertainty about the resilience of its forests under increasing water stress. Simulations by four leading dynamic vegetation models—CLM3.5, ED2, IBIS and JULES—revealed limited ability to replicate both the 20% decline in aboveground biomass and compositional shifts observed in two long-term ecosystem-scale drought experiments in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. These four models were not parameterized to mechanistically represent competitive differences in plant hydraulics that exist between demographic groups; which may in part explain why they performed poorly in the drought simulations. Therefore, we measured xylem vulnerability to cavitation and sensitivity of stomatal conductance to leaf water potential, as determined by turgor loss point (TLP), in order to parameterize a hydrodynamic pipe model for inclusion in the Ecosystem Demography (ED2) dynamic vegetation model. Measurements were made on four genera common to both experimental study sites. Each genus was placed a prior into one of four functional categories: drought tolerant versus intolerant and early versus late successional. We evaluated the hypothesis that these two traits would be significantly different between each of the plant functional groups and thus explain the observed differential mortality rates. P50 values for both xylem cavitation and stomatal closure (i.e. TLP) occurred at 0.5 to 1.0 MPa and 0.75 MPa, respectively, higher water potentials in the drought intolerant genera compared to the tolerant genera. In comparison, the early versus late successional genera showed no significant differences in xylem P50 and TLP. These hydraulic trait values were then used to parameterized a hydrodynamic pipe model that effectively tracked the flow of water through the trees of each functional group and showed differential water-use between the drought tolerant and intolerant groups. The ecological implications during droughts of these differences in hydraulic traits can be evaluated fully once implemented in ED2, which currently tracks competitive dynamics between trees belonging to different demographic groups, but lacks a mechanistic formulation of plant water-use.",

In this study we use a Southern Ocean state estimate developed for the years 2005 to 2010 to describe the spatial and temporal variability of the upper 400m of the Drake Passage region. We focus primarily on ocean heat content and mixed layer depth, and utilize a unique algorithm for finding mixed layer depth that examines steep density gradients within the region.

            "abstract": "Forests within dynamic floodplain landscapes, such as meandering-river landscapes, are composed of uneven-aged trees and entail high spatial variability, which results from intersecting hydrological, fluvial, and ecological processes. Floodplain forests are an important carbon sink relative to other terrestrial ecosystems and thus serve a critical role in the global carbon cycle. Accurate, quantitative aboveground biomass (AGB) retrieval within floodplain forests is urgently needed for improved carbon-pool estimates in such areas and enhanced process understanding of river-floodplain biomorphodynamics. We perform remote AGB retrieval for a meander-bend bottomland hardwood forest, based on utilization of stochastic gradient boosting (SGB), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and Cubist algorithms and multi- and hyperspectral image-based data sets. For multispectral experiments, we use 30-m and 10-m image bands (Landsat 7 ETM+ and SPOT 5, respectively) and ancillary input vectors; for hyperspectral-based experiments, we use 30-m Hyperion bands and other input variables. Results indicate that for both the multispectral and hyperspectral experimental trials, SGB- and MARS-derived AGB are significantly more accurate than Cubist estimates. (Cubist is used for U.S. national-scale forest biomass mapping.) For the multispectral results, across all data-experiments and algorithms, at 10-m spatial resolution, SGB gives the most accurate estimates (RMSE = 22.49 tonnes/ha; coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.96) when geomorphometric data are also included. For 30-m multispectral data trials, MARS performs the best (RMSE = 29.2 tonnes/ha; R2 = 0.94) when image-derived data are also incorporated. For the hyperspectral experiments, the most accurate MARS- and SGB-based retrievals have R2 of 0.97 and 0.95, respectively; the most accurate Cubist AGB retrieval has R2 of 0.85. MARS and SGB AGB are not significantly different though for the hyperspectral experiments. The SGB and MARS approaches may enable improved operational AGB monitoring across scales and environments.",

            "abstract": "The convection electric field penetrates from the polar ionosphere to low latitude and drives the DP2 currents in the global ionosphere with an intensified equatorial electrojet (EEJ). The electric field often reverses its direction, that is, the overshielding occurs and causes the equatorial counterelectrojet (CEJ) during storm and substorms. In this paper we report that the overshielding electric field is detected by the HF Doppler sounders at low latitude on the nightside. We analyzed the Doppler frequency of the HF radio signals propagated over 120 km in Japan at frequencies of 5 and 8 MHz and compared with the equatorial EEJ/CEJ during the substorm expansion phase. We found that the overshielding electric field reaches around 2 mV/m during major substorms (AL <-1800 nT). Taking the geometrical attenuation into account, we estimate the equatorial electric field to be about 1.5 mV/m. We also found that the correlation coefficient was 0.94 between the overshielding electric field and eastward equatorial electrojet at YAP on the night side. The electric field drives the eastward electrojets in the equatorial ionosphere on the night side. It is to be noted that the overshielding electric field is observed on the nightside at low latitude during the major substorms, while the convection electric field is dominant during smaller size substorms, as the CEJ flows on the dayside. These results suggest that the overshielding electric field associated with the Region-2 field-aligned currents becomes dominant during substorms at low latitude on the nightside as well as on the dayside.",

            "abstract": "Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) launched GCOM-W1 (Global Change Observation Mission 1st - Water) satellite on 17 May, 2012 (UT). GCOM-W1 satellite carries the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2). AMSR2 is a multifrequency microwave radiometer, and has the single rotating antenna dish shared by multifrequency feedhorns from 6.9 GHz to 89 GHz. Due to this hardware design, a footprint size of each frequency significantly differs. Therefore, even if the multifrequency data obtained as brightness temperatures originate from the same geolocation, they represent responses of quite a different area one another. Accordingly, not considering the difference of footprint sizes in extracting significant information from the multifrequency brightness temperature will be one of implicit causes to deteriorate its quality.\nIn order to solve this problem, it is necessary to correct multifrequency brightness temperatures observed in native footprints as they are observed in the same footprint. This concept is known as the Backus-Gilbert method. In this method, weighting coefficients for small antenna patterns of high frequency densely distributing in a large antenna pattern of low frequency are first calculated. Then, the large antenna pattern is emulated by weighted average of the small antenna patterns. It is important to find well-modified weighting coefficients in this method. In AMSR2, the brightness temperature dataset corrected by the Backus-Gilbert method is officially defined as level 1R (L1R) product. We have investigated its implementation, especially the criterion to calculate `well-modified' weighting coefficients. The new version of L1R product implemented based on this investigation will be released by the next end of March.\nGenerally, L1R product produces a more effect in analysis of the land surface than the sea surface because microwave signals emitted from the land surface distribute more nonuniformly due to land cover. Therefore, we investigated L1R products related to volcanic eruptions as a reference analysis to verify microwave signals emitted from the land surface are more accurately evaluated by L1R product. In this presentation, we show the analysis results.",

Such variations, including radon activity, CH4/CO2, CO2/3He and 3He/4He ratios of gas compositions, are considered to be precursors of earthquakes in this area. To validate the relationship between fluid compositions and local earthquakes, a continuous monitoring station has been established at Yun-Shuei, which is an artesian well located at an active fault zone in SW Taiwan. It is equipped with a radon detector and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) for in-situ measurement of the dissolved gas composition. Data is telemetered to Taipei so we are able to monitor variations of gas composition in real time. Furthermore, we also installed a syringe pump apparatus for the retrieval and temporal analysis of helium (SPARTAH) at this station [2]. From the SPARTAH samples, we can obtain detailed time series records of He and anion concentration of the water samples at this station. After continuous measurement for a few months, this automated system has been demonstrated to be feasible for long-term continuous seismo-geochemical research in this area. [1] Yang et al.

Frequent flooding due to climate change already exacerbates catchment water quality. Land use is another contributing factor to poor water quality. For example, the move to intensive farming could cause an increase in faecal coliforms entering the water courses. In an effort to understand better the effects on water quality from land use and climate change, the hydrological and estuarine processes are being modelled using SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool), linked to a 2-D hydrodynamic model DIVAST(Depth Integrated Velocity and Solute Transport). The coupled model is able to quantify how much of each pollutant from the catchment reaches the harbour and the impact on water quality within the harbour. The work is focused on the transportation and decay of faecal coliforms from agricultural runoff into the rivers Frome and Piddle in the UK. The impact from the agricultural land use and activities on the catchment river hydrology and water quality are evaluated. The coupled model calibration and validation showed the good model performance on flow and faecal coliform in the watershed and estuary.",

Past studies related to flow, sediment and morphology at confluences have been performed for single threat channels. Herein a detailed mapping, sediment sampling and hydrodynamics are carried for a confluence between anabranching and meandering channels. Furthermore, remote sensing analysis have been performed to understand that the confluence point has been changing at the geologcal time scale increasing the morphological structures around the Ucamara depression, where the Pacaya-Samiria reserve is located.\nResults of the field studies indicate complex mixing processes downstream of the confluence, where secondary flows are observed driven the sediment mixing. The dynamic of the confluence point is governed by the evolution of the Ucayali River and the local geology.

IIASA’s GAINS model (The Greenhouse gas – Air pollution Interactions and Synergies) has been developed as a tool to identify emission control strategies that achieve given targets on air quality and greenhouse gas emissions at least costs. The GAINS-Korea Model, which is being jointly developed by Konkuk University and IIASA, should play an important role in understanding the impact of air quality improvements across the regions in Korea. Source-Receptor relationships (S-R) is an useful methodology in air pollution studies to determine the areas of origin of chemical compounds at receptor point, and thus be able to target actions to reduce pollutions. The GAINS model can assess the impact of emission reductions of sources on air quality in receptor regions based on S-R matrix, derived from chemical transport model. In order to develop S-R matrix for GAINS-Korea, the CAMx model with PSAT/OSAT tools was applied in this study. The coarse domain covers East Asia, and a nesting domain as main research area was used for Korea peninsula. To evaluate of S-R relationships, a modeling domain is divided into sixteen regions over South Korea with three outside of S. Korea countries (China, N. Korea and Japan) for estimating transboundary contributions. The results of our analysis will be presented at the conference.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol samples were collected on Teflon filters at a site up-glacier from Denali Base Camp (2380 m) in Denali National Park, Alaska during May and June of 2013 using an autonomous aerosol sampler powered by solar panels and batteries. The samples were analyzed for major ions via ion chromatography. Surface and fresh snow samples were also collected over the same time period and analyzed for major ions. Ion concentrations in the aerosol samples are completely dominated by NH4+ (mean concentration of 6.6 nmol/m3) and SO4= (mean concentration of 4.0 nmol/m3). Overall, the ion burden in aerosol samples from Denali Base Camp was much lower compared to aerosol samples collected from the Denali National Park and Trapper Creek IMPROVE sites over the same time period.\nIn contrast to the aerosol chemistry, the snow chemistry is more balanced, with NH4+, Ca2+, and Na+ dominating the cation concentrations and NO3-, Cl-, and SO4= dominating the anion concentrations. The higher levels of Ca2+, Na+, and Cl- in the snow (relative to NH4+ and SO4=) compared to relative concentrations in the aerosol samples suggest that dry deposition of sea salt and dust are important contributors to the major ion signals preserved in the snow. This has important ramifications for improving our understanding of the reconstruction of North Pacific climate variability and change from glaciochemical records currently being developed from the 208 m ice cores recovered from the Mt. Hunter plateau (3900 m) during the summer of 2013.",

            "abstract": "The meridional extent and complex orography of the South American continent contributes to a wide diversity of climate regimes ranging from hyper-arid deserts to tropical rainforests to sub-polar highland regions. Global climate models, although capable of resolving synoptic-scale South American climate features, are inadequate for fully-resolving the strong gradients between climate regimes and the complex orography which define the Tropical Andes given their low spatial and temporal resolution. Recent computational advances now make practical regional climate modeling with prognostic mesoscale atmosphere-ocean coupled models, such as the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave-Sediment Transport (COAWST) modeling system, to climate research. Previous work has shown COAWST to reasonably simulate the both the entire 2003-2004 wet season (Dec-Feb) as validated against both satellite and model analysis data. More recently, COAWST simulations have also been shown to sensibly reproduce the entire annual cycle of rainfall (Oct 2003 – Oct 2004) with historical climate model input.\nUsing future global climate model input for COAWST, the present work involves year-long cycle spanning October to October for the years 2031, 2059, and 2087 assuming the most likely regional climate pathway (RCP): RCP 6.0. COAWST output is used to investigate how global climate change impacts the spatial distribution, precipitation rates, and diurnal cycle of precipitation patterns in the Central Andes vary in these yearly “snapshots”. Initial results show little change to precipitation coverage or its diurnal cycle, however precipitation amounts did tend drier over the Brazilian Plateau and wetter over the Western Amazon and Central Andes. These results suggest potential adjustments to large-scale climate features (such as the Bolivian High).",

            "abstract": "Wildfires are regularly occurring emergency events that threaten life, property, and natural resources in every U.S. State and many countries around the world. Despite projections that $1.8 billion will be spent by U.S. Federal agencies alone on wildfires in 2014, the decades-long trend of increasing fire size, severity, and cost is expected to continue. Furthermore, the enormous potential for UAS (and concomitant sensor systems) to serve as geospatial intelligence tools to improve the safety and effectiveness of fire management, and our ability to forecast fire and smoke movements, remains barely tapped.\nAlthough orbital sensor assets are can provide the geospatial extent of wildfires, generally those resources are limited in use due to their spatial and temporal resolution limitations. These two critical elements make orbital assets of limited utility for tactical, real-time wildfire management, or for continuous scientific analysis of the temporal dynamics related to fire energy release rates and plume concentrations that vary significantly thru a fire’s progression. Large UAS platforms and sensors can and have been used to monitor wildfire events at improved temporal, spatial and radiometric scales, but more focus is being placed on the use of small UAS (sUAS) and sensors to support wildfire observation strategies. The use of sUAS is therefore more critical for TACTICAL management purposes, rather than strategic observations, where small-scale fire developments are critical to understand.\nThis paper will highlight the historical development and use of UAS for fire observations, as well as the current shift in focus to smaller, more affordable UAS for more rapid integration into operational use on wildfire events to support tactical observation strategies, and support wildfire science measurement inprovements.",

            "abstract": "Vegetation phenology is well studied in systems where temperature is the primary driver of change, such as temperate and boreal ecosystems. In order to accurately model phenology in water-limited systems it is necessary to consider the role of water stress on mediating phenology. While it is possible to use proxies for water stress, such as vapor pressure deficit (VPD), it is preferable to have a more direct link to the effects of water stress on plant physiology. One possible approach is to incorporate the physiological responses of plants to water stress into phenological models.  The goal of this study is to examine the use of plant hydraulics to help predict phenology instead of using only meteorological variables. We used an ecosystem process model that incorporates plant hydraulics, the Terrestrial Regional Ecosystem Exchange Simulator (TREES), in order to model plant phenology based on hydraulic stress. Phenology submodels implemented within TREES included both those driven purely from environmental variables as well those modulated by plant hydraulics. Results showed that the use of plant hydraulics to predict phenology, instead of using VPD as a proxy of plant water stress, performed favorably in comparison to models driven by meteorological variables alone. The need for better representation of moisture stress on phenology was particularly apparent in water-limited systems and the inclusion of plant hydraulics into phenology models improved the predictions in these systems.",

            "abstract": "This study used ground-based hyperspectral remote sensing data to map rock alterations and lithologies at Semail Ophiolite, Oman, as well as hydrocarbon-induced rock alterations at Cement, Oklahoma. The Samail Ophiolite exposed the largest, least-deformed, and the most-studied ophiolite in the world. Hydrocarbon seepages at Cement, Oklahoma brought hydrocarbons to the Rush Springs sandstones at surface, and generated rock alterations including bleaching of red beds, and carbonate cementation. Surficial expressions of rock alterations and different lithofacies are distinct from adjacent rocks, and can be detected by remote sensing techniques.\nHyperspectral remote sensing acquires light intensity for hundreds of bands in a continuous electromagnetic spectrum from visible light to short-wave infrared radiation, and holds potential to characterize rocks with great precision. Ground-based hyperspectral study could scan the objects at close ranges thus provide very fine spatial resolutions (millimeters to centimeters). This study mapped all the major iconic outcrops of Semail ophiolite including pillow lava, sheeted dykes, layered gabbros, and peridotites. This study also identified surficial rock alterations induced by hydrocarbons at Cement, Oklahoma. Reddish-brown Rush Spring sandstones are bleached to pink, yellow, and gray colors; pore spaces in the sandstones have been filled with carbonate cementation. Laboratory spectroscopy was used to assist with mineral identification and classification in hyperspectral data. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) was used to provide high-accuracy spatial references. Principal component analysis, minimum noise fraction, spectral angle mapper, and band ratios are used in image processing. Combining lithological, remote sensing and geochemical data, this study built a model for petroleum seepage and related rock alterations, and provided a workflow for employing ground-based hyperspectral remote sensing techniques in petrological study as well as resource exploration.",

            "abstract": "There is a lot we know about how carbon is cycled in the soils of different ecosystems, but this understanding is often limited our knowledge of the current conditions of the soil. What happens when the structure of the soil changes? We have found that climate induced changes to soil structure can shift when and where carbon is decomposed especially in soils that are hydrologically-dependent such as permafrost and wetlands. As soils experience drying past their historic limit of dryness, the irreversible changes in soil structure with consolidation can significantly alter the distribution of soil moisture and subsequently the ability of microorganisms to decompose available carbon. Instead of seeing a rapid and significant loss of carbon that would normally be associated with drying in these soils, the change in soil structure and reduction of porosity can potentially buffer carbon loss as drying progresses. This occurs as the smaller pores stay saturated during the consolidation process. This can have large implications for the future of the arctic permafrost as thawing progresses with a warming climate, in addition to natural drying of wetland regions.",

There has been limited research on the responses of carbon fluxes, evapotranspiration (ET), and water use efficiency (WUE) to severe and extended droughts at regional to continental scales. Here we combine a gridded carbon and water flux dataset (EC-MOD), Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), a process-based ecosystem model, and agricultural statistics to examine the impacts of recent droughts on North American terrestrial ecosystems. The gridded flux dataset was upscaled from eddy covariance flux observations across North America through a data-driven approach. We assess the responses of ecosystem carbon fluxes, ET, and WUE to severe and extended droughts at the continental scale using EC-MOD. Drought can lead to significant declines in ET and subsequent decreases in carbon fluxes. The responses of WUE to drought are assessed at the annual scale. Simulations from a process-based ecosystem model and crop yield statistics are also used to assess the effects of drought on agricultural productivity and WUE. Drought is one of the main sources of the interannual variability of carbon and water fluxes in North America. Drought is expected to become more frequent and more severe during the remainder of the 21st century and therefore will likely have larger impacts on terrestrial ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "India is poised to become the most populous country in the world by 2019 and reach a population of over 2 billion by 2050 based on current growth rates. It is also a region which will be under severe socio-economic and environmental stress if mitigation efforts are not adapted. In the past 10 years the population of India has grown by an average rate of 17 million people per year. In addition to unprecedented population growth, rapid urbanization and industrialization are straining the overburdened environmental system. This rapid growth in population, urbanization and industrialized will result in increased demand for food, requiring expansion of agricultural resources. Since total agricultural land in India has been relatively constant over the past 10 years the demand for additional food has to be partly met by enhanced production on existing land. Arable land in India has declined by around 3% according to FAOSTAT while the total agricultural area under irrigation has increased by about 9% thus further straining its water resources. In addition projections for future climate indicate that India is one of the regions where water resources are expected to be negatively impacted. Total agriculture water withdrawal in India increased by approximately 18 % from 2000-2010 while the total per capita water withdrawal increased by over 9% from 2000-2010. Total freshwater withdrawal as percentage of renewable water resources was around 40% in 2010. In addition, recent mandates of biofuel policies in India are also expected to impact its water resources. The combined impact of these various factors on future water availability in India could be one of the most severe globally due its unprecedented increase in population, food production and industrialization. In this study we assess the impact of land use and climate change on water resources over southern India in the face of a growing population and interest in development of national biofuel supplies. We use observational data on historical climate and land use, and future climate projections to drive a coupled hydrological-crop simulation model to quantify these changes and asses their impacts.",

However the GRACE time series only commences in 2002-2003 and a gap of several years may occur in the series before a GRACE follow-on satellite is launched. Satellites tracked by SLR and DORIS have also been used to study time variations in the Earth’s gravitational field. In this paper we discuss the development of a new time series of low degree spherical harmonic fields based on the available SLR, DORIS data. We have developed solutions to 5x5 in spherical harmonics based on data from up to 18 satellites tracked with SLR and DORIS data.

The new solutions are consistent with the IERS2010 standards with respect to the mean pole and the definition of C21 and S21. We discuss the quality of these solutions, the contribution of the various satellites. We have applied this time series to the computation of orbits for TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, & Jason-2 and to the reprocessing of DORIS data for the NASA GSFC submission to ITRF2013 (series gscwd25 and gscwd26).

Eight field campaigns were conducted in each reservoir between 2010 and 2012. Temperature, conductivity and turbidity profiles were measured along the longitudinal axes with a CTD and inflow temperature was recorded continuously with thermistors. In addition, thermistor chains were deployed on the deepest zone of each reservoir, in 2011 in La Fe and in 2013 in Riogrande II. The heat surface fluxes were calculated based on weather measurements, using heat bulk-formulations. It was found that the seasonal variability of the thermal structure in both reservoirs was dominated mainly by changes in the inflows temperature, related to the hydrological cycle, and not by the solar radiation variability. The atmospheric net heat flux revealed low seasonal changes, with the larger variability due to cloud cover and wind speed variability associated to the passage of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The effect of the net atmospheric flux was confined to the surface mixed layer, which thickness varied between 2 and 4 m by the effect of short wave radiation heating during the day and strong heat loss starting at mid afternoon and remaining through the night. The inflow temperature was inversely correlated to the discharge, so large inflows are also colder and denser than small inflows. The plumes from small inflows are intrusive and create an intermediate layer of young water while those of large inflows remain attached to the bottom and fill the reservoir from the bottom. This resulted in the thermal structure of both reservoirs developing a bimodal annual cycle that follows the bimodal distribution of the rainfall and river discharge. Due to the discharge related changing level of the intrusion of the plumes, the vertical distribution of dissolved oxygen and nutrients also followed very closely the hydrologic variability. ",

The field campaign was carried out with a total of five flights out of Fort McMurray, Alberta during the period between August 22 and August 26, 2013. Significant amounts of aerosol were observed within the boundary layer, up to a height of 1.6 km, but the ozone concentration remained at or below background levels. On August 24th the lidar observed a separated layer of aerosol above the boundary layer, at a height of 1.8 km, in which the ozone mixing ratio increased to 70 ppbv. Backward trajectory calculations revealed that the air containing this separated aerosol layer had passed over an area of forest fires. Directly below the layer of forest fire smoke, in the pollution from the oil sands industry, the measured ozone mixing ratio was lower than the background levels (≤35 ppbv).",

In this study we aim to analyze the in situ measurements taken by dropsondes in and around a February 2014 AR over the course of several days, which produced heavy precipitation in Northern California. We find, as in other AR case studies, that the high magnitude winds in the form of low level jets (LLJs) with unusually high water vapor content and stable air masses interact with coastal mountains to produce heavy precipitation near the coast. This study compares the dropsonde observations with NCEP Final Analysis data and Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model outputs. In particular, we compare the forecasts of integrated vapor transport (IVT) against that which was measured by the dropsondes. Model forecasts and observation data of IVT will be presented at the AGU Fall Meeting.",

            "abstract": "In New Caledonia, mangroves receive large inputs of lateritic materials eroded from massive ultramafic deposits enriched in Fe, Ni, Mn, Cr, and Co. Because of the major physicochemical gradients, especially redox gradients, that characterize these ecosystems, mineralogical transformations may influence the crystal-chemistry and bioavailability of Ni and its mobility towards a lagoon of over 20,000 km2. Bulk and spatially resolved chemical analyses by SEM-EDXS were coupled with Ni K-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy analysis to characterize the vertical and lateral changes in Ni speciation across the intertidal zone of a mangrove forest in the Vavouto Bay (New Caledonia) where Ni concentrations range from 1000 to 5300 mg•kg-1. XAFS results indicate that phyllosilicates and goethite inherited from the eroded lateritic materials are the dominant Ni-bearing phases in the surface horizons of the mangrove sediments. They are fully preserved at depth in the dry and oxic salt flat area, located on the inland side of the coast. In contrast, beneath the vegetated Rhizophoras and Avicennias stands Ni-bearing goethites rapidly diminish with increasing depth in the anoxic horizons of the sediments, and pyrite and organic complexes become the dominant Ni-containing species. Moreover, Ni incorporation in pyrite is more developed in the sediments beneath the intermediate Avicennia stand than beneath the Rhizophora stand that is closest to the shore. Such lateral changes in Ni speciation may be related to reoxidation of Ni-bearing pyrites in the Rhizophora stand, which is subject to periodic alternation of reducing and oxidizing events due to tidal fluctuations. These major changes in Ni speciation could significantly influence Ni mobility across the interidal zone. Indeed, as estimated with respect to Ti concentration, which is taken as a geochemical invariant, Ni is found to be immobile in the salt flat, to accumulate beneath the Avicennia stand, and to be partially leached beneath the Rhizophora stand.",

            "abstract": "The U.S. Corn Belt is currently a net source of carbon dioxide and nitrous dioxide to the atmosphere but is also a weak sink for methane. Climate change is projected to increase the frequency and duration of spring precipitation in the North American Midwest, resulting in intermittent flooding and ponding in agricultural fields. Inundation changes the greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes of the soil, especially by promoting methanogenesis under anoxic conditions. DNA and 16S cDNA sequencing results of earlier, similar experiments confirmed the presence of methanogens in soil samples, albeit in low abundance (representing <0.01% of reads per sample). We installed collars into bare ground of a central Illinois research field to experiment with flooding conditions and observe changes in gas fluxes, microbial community, and soil chemistry. We established three treatments of five replicates—control, continuously flooded, and intermittently flooded—each with separate collars for gas flux measurements, soil sample collection, and soil probe measurements. A drip irrigation system flooded the headspaces of the collars to produce flooding events. The continuously flooded collars were maintained in a flooded condition for the duration of the experiment, and the intermittently flooded collars were flooded for 72 hours per flooding event and then kept dry for at least 5 days before the next flooding event. We measured net concentrations of N2O, CH4, and CO2 in situ using a static chamber connected to a cavity ringdown spectrometer. We found that the periodicity of wetting and drying events induces hysteresis effects that push GHG shifts to occur rapidly (< 1 hr). Integrating fluxes across the period of the experiment, the intermittently flooded collars showed 88.7% higher global-warming potential of GHG fluxes at the 100-year horizon versus control, with most of change driven by increased net CO2 flux (87.1% higher) and net methane flux (29 times higher). These data indicate that more frequent flooding and ponding events will have a significant impact of increasing the soil GHG emissions from the U.S. Corn Belt region.",

            "abstract": "Tidal wetlands exchange trace amounts of the potent greenhouse gases (GHGs) methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N20) at the soil-atmosphere interface, potentially diminishing or reversing their role as net carbon dioxide (CO2) sinks. Thus the effectiveness of wetland restoration and creation as a carbon-offset activity is to a large degree influenced by the magnitude of GHG flux rates and their ecological and management drivers. This study sought to evaluate the spatial variation of GHG emissions in a marsh complex by utilizing the static soil chamber technique and gas chromatography to estimate flux rates. We used stratified random sampling to collect flux measurements within a 1065 acre brackish wetland complex, of which 565 acres were restored, in Tomales Bay, CA. Salinities at sample locations ranged from 0.38 to 30ppt. Flux estimates and statistics were calculated using the HMR procedure (HMR package in R) for static chamber data. Briefly, the procedure categorizes data series and assigns the most appropriate data analysis: linear regression, nonlinear regression (Hutchinson and Mosier) or no significant flux. Daily methane emission rates were modeled using a linear regression of log-transformed methane flux data as the response variable and salinity as the predictor variable, yielding a relatively strong negative relationship (Log(CH4 mg m-2day-1) = 2.69 - 0.0465 x Salinity (ppt), R2= 0.49, P<0.0001). Both methane and nitrous oxide flux rates were significantly higher in samples taken from the restored marsh area (N=46) than from locations in the adjacent reference marsh (N=24) (P=0.012, P=0.049 respectively), however, carbon dioxide flux rates were not statistically different between the two areas. The results of this study suggest that wetland restoration and creation activities for the purpose of carbon-offsets should consider utilizing polyhaline sites (18-30ppt) and long-term monitoring of GHG flux rates to verify net carbon sequestration.",

            "abstract": "During warm climates as those experienced during the Early Eocene, water vapor content is expected to locally increase at about 6%/K as warmer temperatures allow for larger values of water vapor saturation, and near surface relative humidity is bound to remain relatively constant. This increase in water vapor results in larger clear sky water vapor absorption near the Equator that decreases towards the poles providing a more equable distribution of shortwave radiation at the surface. Additionally, clouds in mid-latitudes are expected to shift polewards, increasing cloudiness in regions that receive less shortwave radiation and decreasing cloudiness in regions that receive more, again acting as a source of equability for climate. We quantify these two effects using atmospheric GCM simulations run under Eocene boundary conditions for 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 times present concentrations of CO2. We attempt to isolate the effect of the surface radiation distribution on the surface temperature gradient using a simple energy balance model.",

A dramatic shift to 25% organic matter in the pond records Picea needles and the first record of charcoal. Continued increases in LOI in the pond are correlative with the presence of Abies balsamea and Betula papyrifera appears as the boreal forest develops and tundra disappears. A return to colder conditions is suggested with a slight decline in LOI as Betula glandulosa and Larix laricina are present along with the boreal mixture, and a large increase in Daphnia ephippia.

            "abstract": "We report the result of OI 630 nm auroral polarization observation at Poker Flat Research Range (Glat=65.12N, Glon=147.43W, Mlat=65.72N) during the period from December 2013 to April 2014. OI 630nm auroral emission is theoretically expected to show linear polarization with degrees up to 17% [Bommier et al., 2011]. The important point is that, the degree of linear polarization depends on energy and velocity anisotropy of precipitating electrons [Fujimoto et al., 1997]. Recent observation data also showed that 630nm auroral emission related to polar rain at high-latitudes linear polarization parallel to field with degrees of 2-7%[Lilensten et al., 2013]. However, these past measurements were limited in the polar cap region and its polarization characteristics are not clear.\nTo examine auroral polarization with an accuracy of 1% polarization degree, we developed an imaging spectrograph which can measure auroral polarization in the wide field-of-view of 130 deg covering the wavelength range from 420 nm to 680 nm (resolution 2 nm). This new instrument enables us to obtain the linear polarization degrees at 557.7 nm and 630 nm auroral emissions simultaneously. Here, we can regard 557.7 nm aurora as a standard polarization light source because it does not produce polarization theoretically. We installed the spectrograph at Poker Flat Research Range and carried out precise calibration to estimate artificial polarization which is produced inside the optical system using an LED light source with a linear polarizer every 3 hours on five nights in December 2013. Since then, automatic operation was continuously carried every night out till the beginning of April 2014.\nWe obtained the linear polarization of 630 nm aurora with degree of 5% showing elevation angle dependence. On the other hand, we unexpectedly measured the polarization of 557.7 nm emission which shows similar polarization property as 630 nm. We are considering two possibilities to interpret the results as follows. First is that the auroral emissions are additionally scattered and polarized through atmospheric particles and dusts in the middle and lower altitudes in the line-of-sight direction. Second is that we could not correct instrumental artificial polarization effect with the calibration we did last year and further accurate calibration will be required.",

            "abstract": "The Northern California Earthquake Data Center (NCEDC) houses a unique and comprehensive data archive and provides real-time services for a variety of seismological and geophysical data sets that encompass northern and central California. We have over 80 terabytes of continuous and event-based time series data from broadband, short-period, strong motion, and strain sensors as well as continuous and campaign GPS data at both standard and high sample rates in both raw and RINEX format. The Northen California Seismic System (NCSS), operated by UC Berkeley and USGS Menlo Park, has recorded over 890,000 events from 1984 to the present, and the NCEDC provides catalog, parametric information, moment tensors and first motion mechanisms, and time series data for these events. We also host and provide event catalogs, parametric information, and event waveforms for DOE enhanced geothermal system monitoring in northern California and Nevada.\nThe NCEDC provides a variety of ways for users to access these data. The most recent development are web services, which provide interactive, command-line, or program-based workflow access to data. Web services use well-established server and client protocols and RESTful software architecture that allow users to easily submit queries and receive the requested data in real-time rather than through batch or email-based requests. Data are returned to the user in the appropriate format such as XML, RESP, simple text, or MiniSEED depending on the service and selected output format. The NCEDC supports all FDSN-defined web services as well as a number of IRIS-defined and NCEDC-defined services. We also continue to support older email-based and browser-based access to data. NCEDC data and web services can be found at http://www.ncedc.org and http://service.ncedc.org.",

            "abstract": "66 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period, an asteroid impact in the Gulf of Mexico triggered the sudden extinction of an estimated 50% of marine invertebrate species. The event profoundly affected planktonic foraminifera, marine protists with an excellent fossil records in open marine sediments. The mass extinction and expansive fossil record of foraminifera creates the opportunity for detailed studies of the way species and ecosystems evolve and respond to environmental changes.\nCommunity level research is, however, relatively rare compared to geochemical paleoceanographic approaches. This is due, in part, to the fact that community level data collection is labor intensive and only partially records all aspects of the biological response. Here, I use a new approach to quantify community change with a computer-controlled microscope able to take high-resolution images of thousands of foraminifera at a time. Analytical software is used to classify populations by morphology, and this data is compared with traditional assemblage counts from multiple oceanic core sites from the late Maastrichtian to the early Danian.\nPrevious studies have suggested that certain phenotypic characteristics are related to ecological niches –here, the direct measurement of shape of large populations of foraminifera is used to research the possible correlation between the K-Pg boundary events and community structure. Continued study of morphological data can be used to investigate the evolution of foraminiferal phenotypes, the connection between shape and ecological behavior, and the changes they exhibit in response to both sudden and long term changes in climate such as occurred near the K/Pg boundary. The image database of Maastrichtian and early Danian foraminifera will be made available to the scientific community, enabling inter-lab and cross-site comparisons.",

            "abstract": "Preliminary results of an investigation conducted between March and April 2012 on the influence of air pollutants transport in the Puebla-Tlaxcala Valley airshed are presented. The campaign included ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and meteorological variables monitoring at surface in Huaquechula, Chipilo and Amozoc rural sites, and measurements of O3 vertical profile O3 and meteorology in Chipilo. The synoptic conditions during the campaign showed dominance of \"Norte\" conditions favoring air masses circulation from Pacific Ocean crossing southern Mexican Plateau to the Gulf of Mexico that influences the establishment of evening southeasterly winds in the Puebla-Tlaxcala Valley. Wind roses and contaminants analysis in surface for O3 during entire campaign indicates that before noon the movement of air masses was dominated by runoff of Malinche toward the southeast and south of the valley; and in the afternoon a regional pattern of winds from southwest Valley prevails coming from Cuautla Valley and south of Morelos State. The analysis of three representative days of atmospheric circulation in the valley as well as anthropogenic diurnal activity, a rate of morning increase in O3 concentrations similar at all three sites was observed, even in the absence of precursors such as NO2 during some weekends. By analyzing and engage data from O3 vertical profile and surface meteorology data, we could infer that there are minimal ozone contributions from local sources, but important from regional origin, and even O3 entrainment in height brought to the surface when mixing layer is growing. The back trajectory analysis from Chipilo at noon indicates that could be additional contributions of O3 from both Cuautla Valley and other areas of pollutants emission such as Tula, (in the north of Mexico City), and that weekend effect with the occurrence of high O3 levels observed there extends to this region. Although interbasin exchange of pollutants between the Puebla-Tlaxcala Valley and Cuautla is confirmed, also was identified that O3 contribution in the free troposphere is important to sustaining high O3 values during the afternoon in Puebla. This implies that establishment of control strategies at regional level should be based on detailed studies of the influence of O3 seasonality in the free troposphere.",

            "abstract": "Nitrous oxide can be produced by a broad range of processes under various environmental conditions, making it generally difficult to establish the sources of N2O. We have developed high resolution mass spectrometric techniques to provide six-dimensional isotopic fingerprints of N2O. On a single sample, we measure δ15N, δ18O, ∆17O, 15N site preference (‘SP’), and the clumped isotopologues 14N15N18O and 15N14N18O. The relative abundance of these clumped isotopologues is expressed as (1) a 15N site preference for 18O-containing isotopologues (‘SP18’) and (2) an overall preference for clumped isotopologues, ∆(14N15N18O+15N14N18O), over the expectation for a random distribution of isotopes among isotopologues. Each of these six isotopic parameters distinctively combines information about substrates, equilibrium exchange reactions, diffusive transport, mixing, and the kinetics of production and consumption mechanisms. We will describe the preliminary characterization of N2O produced by various biotic and abiotic sources. In particular, nitrous oxide from a genetic mutant of the denitrifying bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PA14 that lacks the ability to reduce N2O to N2 is shown to have a site preference consistent with past measurements of denitrifiers. Its clumped isotopic composition is also distinct from predicted values for equilibrium and provides a signature for N2O production by a denitrifier. Measurements of ∆17O from two experiments with different starting nitrate ∆17O can be used to determine both the effective 18O/16O fractionation factor for reduction of nitrate to N2O (37±4‰), as well as the fraction of O atoms exchanged with water for this organism (52±6%). N2O collected from Lake Vida, Antarctica, has a site preference and clumped isotope composition distinct from that produced by P. aeruginosa. Also, both SP and ∆(14N15N18O+15N14N18O) in Lake Vida N2O are negative, which places constraints on its production and processing, and suggests synthesis at a transition state quite distinct from either the known NO reductase enzymes or the structure of N2O itself.",

Recent work (Zhang et al. 2014; O’Brien et al. 2014) presents TEX86 derived SSTs that show higher temperatures in the Pacific warm pool of the early Pliocene compared to Uk’37 and Mg/Ca SST records. While TEX86 is subject to several limitations, include a relatively large calibration error and an uncertain depth of production, the data suggest that a strong zonal temperature gradient in the equatorial Pacific was maintained in the hotter world of the early Pliocene in contrast to previous work. Here we present preliminary, low-resolution TEX86 data from 30 sites with previously published Uk’37 or Mg/Ca records from the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The interval from 16 Ma to 2 Ma is targeted to capture the transition from the hothouse of the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum to the icehouse of the late Pliocene. Both zonal and meridional SST gradients are evaluated and the three temperature proxies are compared to investigate when and in what conditions discrepancies occur, particularly focusing on upwelling zones in the deep tropics.",

Understand and describe the connectivity and exchange between different regions of the ocean is very important for larvae dispersion study and other tracers like pollutants. In this work we use an offline numerical model to simulate Lagrangian particle trajectories in the Eastern Mexican Pacific (between 120-94 W and 12-34 N). Particles are advected whit velocity fields generated with the model ROMS (Regional Ocean Modeling System) in the period 1980-2006. We define connectivity indexes in order to classify different zones by their capacity of exporting, receiving and retaining particles. We aim to identify the most transited pathways, quantify connectivity between different regions of EMP through connectivity matrix and describe their seasonal variability. It has been identified zones of high isolation and retention (Vizcaino Bay, Northern of Gulf of California), high retention and importation (between Ensenada and Point Conception) and high exportation and importation (Cabo Corrientes). Connectivity has clear equatoward preference in the California Peninsula region dominated by the influence of California Current with an increase in winter and spring, and also equatoward in the south region of Mexico (from Cabo Corrientes to Tehuantepec Gulf), dominated by the anticyclonic circulation of Tehuantepec Dome. It is observed a complete disconnection between the Baja California Peninsula and Cabo Corrientes zone and further south. Results suggest that the scales of connectivity does not significantly change for simulations over 3 months.",

            "abstract": "A large scale geothermal project conducted by National Science Council is initiated recently in I-Lan south area, northeastern Taiwan. The goal of this national project is to generate at least 5 MW electricity from geothermal energy. To achieve this goal, an integrated team which consists of various specialties are held together to investigate I-Lan area comprehensively. For example, I-Lan geological data, petrophysical analysis, seismicity, temperature distribution, hydrology, geochemistry, heat source study etc. were performed to build a large scale 3D conceptual model of the geothermal potential sites. In addition, not only a well of 3000m deep but also several shallow wells are currently drilling to give us accurate information about the deep underground.\nAccording to the current conceptual model, the target area is bounded by two main faults, Jiaosi and Choshui faults. The geothermal gradient measured at one drilling well (1200m) is about 49.1˚C/km. The geothermal reservoir is expected to occur at a fractured geological formation, Siling sandstone layer.\nThe preliminary results of this area from all the investigations are used as input parameters to create a realistic numerical reservoir model. This work is using numerical simulator TOUGH2/EOS1 to study the geothermal energy potential in I-Lan area. Once we can successfully predict the geothermal energy potential in this area and generate 5 MW electricity, we can apply the similar methodology to the other potential sites in Taiwan, and therefore increase the percentage of renewable energy in the generation of electricity.\nA large scale of three-dimensional subsurface geological model is built mainly based on the seismic exploration of the subsurface structure and well log data. The dimensions of the reservoir model in x, y, and z coordinates are 20x10x5 km, respectively. Once the conceptual model and the well locations are set up appropriately based on the field data, sensitivity studies on production and injection rates, heat source, fractures, and all the relevant parameters are performed to evaluate their effects on temperature distribution of reservoir for 30 years. Through these sensitivity studies, we can design the better geothermal system in I-Lan area and reduce the risk of exploitation.",

            "abstract": "Rainfall-triggered landslides are a consistent threat to life and property around the world and are extremely challenging to physically model over large areas. The Dynamic Landslide Assessment model combines a static landslide susceptibility map with a decision tree approach that considers satellite-derived rainfall and soil moisture thresholds to designate landslide “warning” or null value for the evaluated pixel. This model is used in order to facilitate the development and implementation of an online landslide ‘nowcast’ system for the region of Central America. For initial diagnostics, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated from a 3-year model run of 125 landslide points in Central America.\nTo optimize the threshold necessary to trigger a landslide, normalized rainfall was evaluated against landslide occurrence in each model run and the True Positive Rates (TPR) and False Positive Rates (FPR) recorded. Each curve is evaluated against other instances by locating the minimum distance from a perfect fit (TPR = 1and FPR = 0) on a calculated ROC curve. The preliminary runs of the model are promising; the smallest R value is associated with a TPR of 0.79 and a FPR of 0.21. In addition, the inclusion of soil moisture data improves the skill of the model when rainfall is considered within a temporal window of a single day. However, consideration of larger precipitation windows (e.g. 3-day) somewhat diminishes the effectiveness of the inclusion of soil moisture data. Nevertheless, the simplicity of the model will continue to facilitate evaluation and inclusion of new data sources and metrics, as well as rapid integration of the model components within the developing online system.",

            "abstract": "Characterization of hydraulically induced fractures in unconventional oil and gas development can significantly improve production efficiency and reduce the related environmental impacts. Microseismic monitoring is the primary technology for imaging the initiation and growth of the induced fractures. While fracture geometric attributes and distribution can be inferred from recorded microseismic measurements, delineating the open fractures that contribute to production and quantifying their hydraulic properties require complementary flow and transport data such as tracer and production measurements. We consider estimating fracture geometric attribute and conductivity from combined microseismic, production, and tracer data. To this end, we use a forward model with geomechanical considerations to predict the microseismic and tracer response for hydraulically fractured formations and apply a hierarchical ensemble Kalman filtering approach to update the fracture geometric and hydraulic properties. We investigate the applicability of our estimation approach by consider several case studies with different number of fracture stages, fracture length scales, and hydraulic conductivity. We first update fracture dimensions using microseismic and tracer data that do not contain any information about flow properties. We then estimate the hydraulic conductivity of the fractures from tracer and production data. The proposed fracture imaging framework can be applied in real-time to guide the fracturing process, to monitor the fracture growth, and to optimize the hydraulic fracturing design and minimize potential environmental impacts. Moreover, calibration of the fracture conductivity can be used to predict future production and identify candidate regions for re-fracturing.",

Yet it is the single most neglected aspect of satellite derived cloud data records. Without a measure of uncertainty it is difficult to assess the quality of cloud data for use in any range of studies, from global climate model assessments to regional cloud process case studies. Cloud data records from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer(MODIS) are considered to be reliable, inter-consistent, and well calibrated, yet no measures of uncertainty are included in any level of data. As studies utilizing MODIS cloud data become more nuanced and complex and as scientists try to squeeze more information of smaller magnitudes out of the records, it is imperative to estimate uncertainties.\nWe will have two purposes for study:\n1) Compare natural variability to measures of uncertainty at multiple spatiotemporal scales for cloud cover and top pressure\n2) Show how estimates of uncertainty might be used to determine the fit-for-purpose use of cloud data\nMeasures of uncertainty are provided for the MODIS cloud cover and cloud top pressure at various spatiotemporal scales, ranging in time from daily observations to decadal averages for spatial scales of 1km to global for each source of uncertainty and combined for all sources. We will focus on the combined uncertainty from all sources and for illustrative purposes will present uncertainty introduced by cloud heterogeneity. Cloud heterogeneity is the single largest source of uncertainty in satellite derived cloud data records. Discretizing the continuum of cloud for the purposes of producing cloud data introduces uncertainty at all spatial scales. We divide cloud heterogeneity into three groups: heterogeneity across a cloud top or the ‘bumpiness’ of a cloud, e.g. cloud shadow; heterogeneity of cloud cover; heterogeneity changes across data record characteristics, e.g. pixel size over disparate view geometries. MODIS’s spatial resolution of 250m allows for the assessment of cloud heterogeneity on spatial scales of importance utilizing cloud data.\nEffects of these three disparate cloud heterogeneities on cloud property data records ranging from 10-year cloud cover maps at 1km spatial resolution to regional and global timeseries analyses will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Cassini has determined three important gravitational coefficients for Enceladus, J2, C22 and J3 (Iess et al., Science 344, 78). The gravity field is non-hydrostatic to 3σ (J2/C22 = 3.38–3.63, as opposed to 10/3). Iess et al. interpret these in terms of a hydrostatic interior (core) and isostatic (not hydrostatic) floating ice shell. The hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic contributions are separated by assuming the isostatic compensation depth is the same for each gravity term, although this can’t be strictly true in the case of a regional south polar sea. The inferred normalized moment-of-inertia (0.335) implies a core density of 2340–2400 kg/m3, consistent with a highly hydrated and oxidized (sulfate-rich) core, or more plausibly (in a cosmochemical sense), a porous, water-saturated core. The long-term stability of such porosity is questionable, however. Modest topography on a more indurated core could significantly contribute to the gravity signal. For example, if Enceladus’ core density were 3000 kg/m3, excess topography of only 1 km amplitude could provide the same “hydrostatic” J2 component as modeled in Iess et al. (and requires only 0.1 MPa of stress support). There is also the question of compensation depth of the ice shell. Different formalisms for spherical shells exist in the literature (e.g., Lambeck vs. Turcotte); Iess et al. follow the former and derive a 30-to-40-km thick shell at the south pole, whereas the Turcotte formalism gives a shell only 18-25-km thick. We pay particular attention to this issue, and note a thinner shell would be more mechanically compatible with the spacing of the “tiger stripes,” if the fissures are indeed crevasses open to the ocean below.",

            "abstract": "Fluvial wood is an essential component of stream ecosystems by providing habitat, increasing accumulation of organic matter, and increasing the processing of nutrients and other materials. However, years of channel alterations in Massachusetts have resulted in low wood loads despite the afforestation that has occurred since the early 1900s. Streams have also been impacted by a large density of dams, built during industrialization, and reduction of the beaver population. Beavers were reintroduced to Massachusetts in the 1940s and they have since migrated throughout the state. Beaver dams impound water, which traps sediment and results in the development of complex channel patterns and more ecologically productive and diverse habitats than those found adjacent to man-made dams. To develop better management practices for dam removal it is essential that we understand the geomorphic and ecologic function of wood in these channels and the interconnections with floodplain dynamics and stream water chemistry.\nWe investigate the connections among fluvial wood, channel morphology, floodplain soil moisture dynamics, and stream water chemistry in six watersheds in Massachusetts that have been impacted by either beaver or man-made dams. We hypothesize that wood load will be significantly higher below beaver dams, subsequently altering channel morphology, water chemistry, and floodplain soil moisture. Reaches are surveyed up- and downstream of each type of dam to better understand the impact dams have on the fluvial system. Surveys include a longitudinal profile, paired with dissolved oxygen and ammonium measurements, cross-section and fluvial wood surveys, hydraulic measurements, and floodplain soil moisture mapping. We found that dissolved oxygen mirrored the channel morphology, but did not vary significantly between reaches. Wood loads were significantly larger downstream of beaver dams, which resulted in significant changes to the ammonium levels. Floodplain soil moisture dynamics revealed that wood loads increased the channel complexity and strengthened connections between the stream channel and floodplain. Future work will continue to explore the complex interconnections between beaver dams, channel morphology, hydraulics, floodplain dynamics and water chemistry.",

            "abstract": "In both experiments in the atmosphere and simulated flows, large meandering structures are observed to exist as streaky structures of positive and negative stream wise velocity fluctuations. These “superstructures” are hypothesized to play an important role in the exchange of momentum and energy between the surface layer and the outer layer of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). Although these structures have been observed in a variety of flows, their dependence on external forcing parameters and the nature of transport between them and small scale turbulent flow features is still unresolved. A series of large-eddy simulations of the ABL with different forcing parameter in a high aspect ratio domain (128 Km x 1.5 Km in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively) was used to examine the distribution of these structures and the role they play in accumulating or transferring energy to other scales. To begin to address the dependence of these structures on atmospheric forcing and how this dependence manifests in the ABL, the effect of large-scale rotation was studied by simulating ABL flows with different Rossby numbers. Correlations and wavenumber spectra of the resolved velocity field were studied to identify the signatures and spatial length scales associated with these superstructures. The energy transfer to and from these flow structures was explored by examining the nature of triadic interaction with other flow scales. It was observed that energy transfer between large-scale structures was non local when superstructure scales interacted with scales that where much larger than the boundary layer height and that these interactions had characteristics of two-dimensional turbulence. Conversely when the other two flow scales involved in the exchange process were smaller than the order of boundary layer height, the exchange was characteristic of local energy transfer through non-local interactions.",

Different land surfaces have different spectral signatures in the microwave portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Their spatial and temporal behaviors are also highly variable. These properties are yet not well understood in microwave frequencies, despite their capability in detecting water-related variables in the atmosphere and land surface. A classification scheme was developed to stratify the Earth's land surfaces based on their seasonally dynamic microwave signatures. An unsupervised clustering approach was used identify and distinguish data groupings along two microwave based indicies. Land surface data clusters were mapped to determine their spatial relationships to known land cover groupings. Differences in land surface clusters were analyzed in their spatial consistency and their direction and magnitude of land surface change. It was found that vegetation and topography were the predominant contributors to change between seasons. Land surface extremes of sandy desert and closed canopy tropical forest displayed minimal intra-annual variability while transitional zones, such as the Sahel and North American temperate forests, exhibited the most variability. Distinct microwave signatures varied between seasons along a latittudinal gradient. Overall variability in land surface types increased at high lattitudes. This classification will help inform research studies maniputlating the microwave frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum to better characterize land surface dynamics, and will be very useful in the validation of radiative transfer models and quantification of uncertainty in global precipitation monitoring.",

We investigated the effect of combustion temperatures on the physical and chemical properties of five soils from an elevation transect that spans from 210 to 2865 m.a.s.l. along the Western slope of the Sierra Nevada. All soils formed on a granitic parent material under either oak woodland, oak/mixed-conifer forest, mixed-conifer forest or subalpine mixed-conifer forest ecosystem. Soils show significant differences in SOM content and mineralogy owing to the effects of climate on soil development. Soils from 0 to 5 cm depth were combusted in a muffle furnace at six different temperatures within major fire intensity classes (150, 250, 350, 450, 550 and 650ºC). We determined the effects of combustion temperature on aggregation; specific surface area; pH; mineralogy; cation exchange capacity; carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content; 13C and 15N isotopic composition, and distribution within aggregate sizes; and quality of SOM through infrared spectroscopy. Among other things, we found significant reduction total C and N, accumulation of aromatic carbon functional groups, and loss of aggregation with implication to loss of protection of C as the combustion temperature increases. The findings demonstrate that most significant changes in the soils physical and chemical properties occur around 350ºC. Findings from this study are critical for estimating the amount and rate of change in C and N loss, and other essential soil properties that can be expected from topsoils exposed to different intensity fires.",

The understanding of dynamics of density current is largely determined by the amount of interfacial mixing or entrainment between the ambient and dense fluids. No previous experimental or numerical studies have been done to estimate entrainment in classical lock-exchange system. The differences in entrainment between the lock-exchange and constant flux are explored. Comparing the results of flat bed with inclined surface results, flow exhibits significant differences near the leading edge or nose of the front of the density currents due to inclination of surface. Further, the instabilities are remarkably enhanced resulting Kelvin-Helmholtz and lobe-cleft type of instabilities arises much earlier in time. In this study, a brief analysis of entrainment on lock-exchange density current is presented using different bed slopes and a set of reduced gravity values (g’). We relate the entrainment value with different flow parameters such as Froude number (Fr) and Reynolds number (Re).",

            "abstract": "Among the technical alternatives of CCS, Koide and Xue (2009) proposed the technology, CO2 Microbubble Storage (CMS). In CMS, CO2 is injected into shallow geology as microbubbles in water. Suzuki et al. (2012)\nstudied on the legal, economic, and effective operation of CMS and showed an appropriate one as follows. CO2 microbubbles are injected in a vertical injection well with water withdrawn from the surrounding wells. When the microbubbles are mixed with water, the water is quickly saturated with CO2 because of the large surface area of the bubbles. As a result, CO2 is injected into geology as the solute, mostly bicarbonate ion. The cost efficiency of this operation is reasonbale.   \n\nThere is an issue that should be assessed when CO2 dissolved water is injected in shallow geology. That is the migration of low pH groundwater. The low pH pore solution might have impacts on the underground environment. Here the preliminary numerical study on the pH buffering capacity for CMS was done.  \n\nIn the numerical study, groundwater migration dominated by Darcy law, the advective and dispersive transport of the ions, and the reaction between pore water and minerals were considered. One dimensional geology model was used. There are various mechanisms that bring pH buffering effect in an underground circumstance. Here calcite dissolution by low pH groundwater was considered because it is one of the most casual phenomena that can bring pH buffering effect.   The results of the case studies where the different mass fractions of calcite in the model layer were supposed show that the pore solution in the case with calcite was neutralized and that in the case without calcite was not. They also showed that the mass fraction of calcite does not change much the pH buffering effect. Those results were brought by the principle that the pH of the pore solution is controlled by the equilibrium constant of the reaction between minerals and the pore solution. That is, the excess portion of calcite is not related with the pH increase at the moment. However, the results that the mass fraction of calcite at the most up flow grid gradually decreased indicate that the initial mass fraction of calcite affects the longevity of pH buffering capacity.",

With declining ice cover, the Arctic Ocean will likely be subject to increased shipping traffic in addition to exploration activity for natural resources with a concomitant increase in air pollution. Thus, there is a multifaceted need to monitor the polar region. A number of Canadian government departments, led by the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), are proposing the Polar Communications and Weather (PCW) mission to provide improved communications and critically important meteorological and air quality information for the Arctic using an operational meteorological imager. Two satellites in highly eccentric orbits with apogees at ~ 40,000 km over the Arctic would provide quasi-geostationary viewing over the Arctic with 24-7 coverage in the IR and measurements using solar reflected light in the summertime. The planned operational meteorological instrument is a 21-channel spectral imager with UV, visible, NIR and MIR channels similar to MODIS and ABI. This presentation will focus on the development of an Imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer (IFTS) to be flown on a high-altitude balloon to demonstrate the capacity to monitor methane and carbon dioxide in the Arctic as part of the PHEOS-WCA (Weather, Climate and Air quality) mission, which is an atmospheric science complement to the operational PCW mission.\nFunding is now in place to develop the demonstrator IFTS to show that images of methane and carbon dioxide can be collected from space. The characteristics of the instrument and plans for the balloon flight will be discussed and details of the full PCW mission and PHEOS-WCA component will be presented.

The Arctic is warming at a rate much higher than the Southern high latitudes. Despite fundamental differences between the physical responses to climate in these regions, CMIP5 modes predict small increases in biological production both in the SO and the Arctic, partially compensating for the severe loss of primary production in the rest of the oceans.\nSouth of 40ºS, the CMIP5 models predict a complex, zonally-banded pattern of phytoplankton abundance and productivity changes driven by shifts in light and iron availability with future warming, in agreement with patterns and mechanisms emerging from a satellite trend analysis and other recent observational work. Increased SAM plays a major role in these projections, as increased Southern Ocean westerlies act both to increase mixing and phytoplankton light limitation in a band around 50S, and to modify iron supply to the surface in regions where phytoplankton are iron limited. By contrast, phytoplankton are light and nitrate co-limited in the strongly stratified Arctic ocean. Here we find that over 100 years, release of light limitation due to sea ice retreat is counter-balanced by an increase in nitrogen limitation due to increased stratification. While most models predict net increases in Arctic production by the end of the 21st century, the different strengths of nutrient-light co-limitation among models result in different magnitude changes in production across models.\nWe assess the multi-model 100-year trend significance using a novel technique based on bootstrap combined with a weighting scheme based in similarity across models.\nWe find that model uncertainty in ecological and biogeochemical parameters is higher than for the physical parameters. Additionally, the spread in model predictions is smaller than the spread in historical ecological and biogeochemical parameters.\nMore energy should be focused on improving simulations of ocean-atmosphere dynamics, biogeochemistry and ecology within the high latitudes, as the uncertainties and spread among models are larger in these regions compared to lower latitudes.",

The active volcano, close to some of the largest urban centers in Mexico - 60 km and 30 km far from Mexico City and Puebla, respectively - poses a high hazard to an estimated population of 500 thousand people living in the vicinity of the edifice. Accordingly, in July 1994 the Popocatepetl Volcanological Observatory (POVO) was established. The observatory is operated and supported by the National Center for Disaster Prevention of Mexico (CENAPRED), and is equipped to fully monitor different aspects of the volcanic activity. Among the instruments deployed, we use in this investigation two tiltmometers and broad-band seismometers at two sites (Chipiquixtle and Encinos), which send the information gathered continuously to Mexico City.\nIn this research, we study the characteristics of the tiltmeters signals minutes after the occurrence of certain earthquakes. The Popocatepetl volcano starts inflation-deflation cycles due to the ground motion generated by events located at certain regions. We present the analysis of the tiltmeters and seismic signals of all the earthquakes (Mw>5) occurred from January 2013 to June 2014, recorded at Chipiquixtle and Encinos stations. First, we measured the maximum tilt variation after each earthquake. Next, we apply a band-pass filter for different frequency ranges to the seismic signals of the two seismic stations, and estimated the total energy of the strong motion phase of the seismic record. Finally, we compared both measurements and observed that the maximum tilt variations were occurring when the maximum total energy of the seismic signals were in a specific frequency range. We also observed that the earthquake records that have the maximum total energy in that frequency range were the ones with a epicentral location south-east of the volcano. We conclude that our observations can be used set the ground for an early warning sytem of the Popocatepetl volcano.",

However, until recently most of the work in this area has been focused on agricultural or grassland systems.

We found that most of the soil organic matter eroded from low-order catchments in the western slope of the Sierra Nevada Mountains is composed of forest floor material that has high concentrations of carbon. The steep slopes of these catchments also contribute to export of large proportion of the eroded forest floor material out of the catchments. Our radiocarbon analyses showed that the soil organic matter in the eroded material is composed of modern (post-1950) carbon with fraction modern values at or above 1. We also found that neither elevation, nor climate (across six years that we investigated) leads to significant changes in the composition and mean residence times of the eroded material, despite considerable differences in mean residence time of soil organic mater in soil profiles of the contributing hillslopes in the high vs. low elevation (low elevation: 1800 m, high elevation: 2300 m) catchments we studied. Our findings show that soil organic matter eroded from upland forested catchments is a lot more susceptible to decomposition, compared to organic matter eroded from agricultural or grassland systems likely leading to a less significant role of soil erosion on terrestrial carbon sequestration in forested catchments.",

            "abstract": "Forest restoration and management goals are shifting in northern Minnesota in light of new information on climate trends. Adaptation forestry encompasses a combination of practices designed to favor native populations and species likely to persist under warmer, drier conditions. The overarching project goal is to increase the adaptive capacity of northern forests such that they continue to sustain a variety of services, including carbon sequestration, fiber production, watershed protection, and wildlife habitat. We are currently testing the feasibility and efficacy of adaptation forestry in the northern Great Lakes region in three common forest types: Boreal-Mixed, Pine, and Hardwoods. 12 sites (2,000 acres total) recently subjected to a range of structural treatments (gap creation, shelterwood, and clear-cut with reserves) were coupled with “adaptation plantings” of species that are likely to thrive under changed climate conditions (e.g., red oak, bur oak, white pine). Seedlings, ~110,000 total, originated from two source locations, one that reflects current adaptation to the climate of northern Minnesota and another from a more southern source in central Minnesota. To date, we have assessed results from two growing seasons by tracking survival, growth and phenological characteristics of planted seedlings. This project is a first step in determining whether adaptation management can be used as a tool to help northern forests transition to an uncertain future. Cooperation with state, federal, and academic partners may ultimately influence the adaptive capacity across millions of acres in the Great Lakes region.",

            "abstract": "We show that the profile of the isotopic composition of water vapor can be used to quantify the contribution of deep convection to water vapor in the UT/LS region. The contribution of UT/LS cirrus to radiation balance means that the control of moisture to the TTL is of particular importance. The various processes affecting UT/LS water include convective sources of water (injection of convective ice and subsaturated convective air), dehydration via in situ cirrus formation and sedimentation, and moistening from mixing with extratropical air, but none have been quantified with certainty. We show that these processes can be combined into a one-dimensional advection-dilution model for the isotopic ratio of TTL water vapor, with sources and sinks due to convective moistening and in situ cirrus formation, most of whose parameters can be described from observations and reanalysis. This model can then be fit to an averaged tropical profile of water vapor isotopic ratio in the TTL. The result allows us to back out the convective contribution to UT/LS water vapor. That water vapor contributes directly to in-situ cirrus formation because any injection of water vapor into the subsaturated UT/LS must subsequently be removed by in-situ dehydration. Using isotopic profiles from the ACE-FTS solar-occultation instrument and assuming timescales for evaporation and removal by sedimentation, we demonstrate that convective injection of water vapor significantly increases the production of in-situ cirrus over expectations from large-scale uplift alone. We also show that the turnaround point of UT/LS isotopic profiles – the altitude where isotopic composition begins to increase with height – is readily explained as reflecting the bulk isotopic composition in overshooting convection.",

State surveys maintain these collections to support their own research as well as the research conducted by external users from other organizations. This includes organizations such as government agencies (state and federal), academia, industry and the public. The preliminary results presented in this paper will look at the research processes of these external users. In particular: how they discover, access and use digital surrogates, which they use to evaluate and access physical items in these collections.\nData such as physical samples are materials that cannot be completely replaced with digital surrogates. Digital surrogates may be represented as metadata, which enable discovery and ultimately access to these samples. These surrogates may be found in records, databases, publications, etc. But surrogates do not completely prevent the need for access to the physical item as they cannot be subjected to chemical testing and/or other similar analysis.\nThe goal of this research is to document the various processes external users perform in order to access physical materials. Data for this study will be collected by conducting interviews with these external users. During the interviews, participants will be asked to describe the workflow that lead them to interact with state survey repositories, and what steps they took afterward. High level processes/categories of behavior will be identified. These processes will be used in the development of an information seeking behavior model. This model may be used to facilitate the development of management tools and other aspects of cyberinfrastructure related to physical samples.",

            "abstract": "Available observations and thermal simulations suggest that Ceres is a warm icy body differentiated in a rocky core and icy shell. This model is supported by recent detection of a cloud of water vapor sourced from a couple of regions at the surface of the asteroid (Kueppers et al. (2014) Nature 505, 525). Combining geophysical tools developed for icy satellite modeling and hydrogeochemistry modeling, we derive interior and geological evolution scenarios for a variety of assumptions on the asteroid’s accretional environment.\nKey events include (1) the early differentiation of a rocky core accompanied by a phase of intensive hydration in high pH environment. These conditions are favorable to the production of brucite and carbonates, as well as the redistribution of certain elements, e.g., potassium, from the rock to the aqueous phase; (2) an episode of partial dehydration of the core accompanied by a major heat pulse and further rock leaching; (3) efficient convection, including a phase in the mobile-lid regime that could have been responsible for the recent emplacement of Ceres’ surface.\nIt is important to keep in mind that Ceres is a small object whose main heat source is limited to long-lived radioisotope decay. Hence it is unlikely, from a basic thermal standpoint, that this object could maintain cryovolcanic activity at present. However, we will also report on a scenario in which potassium-40 has been extensively leached from the rock and is now concentrated in thick salt cumulates at the interface between the rocky core and shell, as was proposed for Europa (Prieto-Ballesteros and Kargel (2005) Icarus 173, 212). Low salt thermal conductivity combined with potassium-40 abundance may lead to partial melting. Whether or not this warm layer at the base of the icy shell can promote a late phase of cryovolcanism will be evaluated and presented at the meeting.\nWe will compare the implications of these models against other models for the emplacement of Ceres’ surface whose extensive geological and compositional mapping by the Dawn spacecraft will be our primary source of information on Ceres’ origin and evolution.\nAcknowledgements: This work is being conducted at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract to NASA.

            "abstract": "Weather and climate are critical influences of wildland fire activity. Climate change has led to an increase in the size and frequency of wildfires in many parts of the United States. These changes are expected to increase under current climate change scenarios, likely exacerbating so called “mega-fire” activity. Megafires are typically the most devastating and costly to suppress. It is then desirable to know when and where weather conditions will be conducive to the development of these fires in the future. However, standard statistical methods may not be suited to handle the data imbalance and high-dimensional features of such an analysis. We use an ensemble machine learning approach to estimate the risk of megafires based on weather and climate variables for each ecosystem in the contiguous U.S. Bootstrap aggregated trees are used to describe which suite of coarse scale weather conditions has historically best separated megafires from other large fires and to estimate the conditional probability of a “megafire” given ignition. The annual distribution of ignitions was estimated to calculate an overall probability of a “megafire” and spatial wildfire patterns were used to appropriately distribute this probability across space. This framework was then applied to future climate projections under the RCP8.5 scenario to estimate the future risk of these fire types. Our methodology was applied to various climate change scenarios and suggests that the frequency of these types of fires is likely to increase throughout much of the western United States in the next 50 years.",

            "abstract": "Bridge scour design predicts the depth of erosion given conditions of the streambed, geometry and flow. The depth of the scour hole is calculated empirically, while the width is assumed to be a percentage of the estimated depth. In Vermont, bridge damage resulting from the 2011 Tropical Storm Irene showed high numbers of stream widening and outflanking at bridges rather than vertical scour holes. The outflanking of bridges is not represented in current bridge scour design, where riprap is typically recommended to prevent horizontal stream migration. This study evaluates whether stream geomorphic information can be used to determine conditions that resulted in outflanking. Post flood inspection photographs are reviewed to identify cases of outflanking, and data from the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) and the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources’ (VTANR) Rapid Geomorphic Assessment (RGA) are used to determine the specific site and stream characteristics at the bridges. When applicable, bridge design plans and HEC-RAS modeling are used to compare scour depth calculations to evidence of damage from site photographs. Geomorphic assessments are used to determine if there are site differences that resulted in outflanking rather than traditional vertical scour. The damage from outflanking erosion can be quantified and modeled similar to the process of calculating scour depths, aiding in the prediction of outflanking, and improving the ability to design against it.",

To represent future MJO change, historical experiment data from 1979 to 2005 and representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5) run data from 2071 to 2100 are compared. Several changes and associated processes are investigated: 1) MJO will strengthen. For this, the following three aspects are presented. First, in wavenumber-frequency power spectrum analysis for 30-90 days filtered precipitation over [15°S-15°N], spectral power tends to increase significantly. Second, the explained variance of combined EOF1 and EOF2 using 30-90 days filtered zonal winds at 200 and 850 hPa and OLR increases from 46% to 54%. Lastly, the days of MJO index (defined as the amplitude of PC1 and 2 in combined EOF) that is larger than 1.0 increase. 2) Changes in the MJO phase speed are unclear, because different models in CMIP5 show different results. The main process for controlling the phase speed of the MJO will be examined using two and half layer model.

Uncertainty remains in the simulations, including the identification of primary sources and secondary tracers, the understanding of the formation mechanisms, and the representation of the atmospheric evolution of OA. There have been limited ambient measurements available to test simulations that use elemental composition to constrain the sources and aging of OA. In this study, a large dataset including both surface, aircraft, and laboratory observations of the atomic oxygen-to-carbon (O:C) and hydrogen-to-carbon (H:C) ratios of OA is synthesized and corrected for the bias of general Aerosol Mass Spectrometer elemental analysis. Mean observed O:C and H:C ratios range from 0.3 to 0.9 and 1.3 to 1.9, respectively, for the ground sites. Aircraft measurements show more oxidized OA with a vertical-level mean O:C of 1.2 and H:C of 1.4. We developed a global model simulation for the elemental composition of OA based on laboratory measurements. The standard GEOS-Chem simulation underestimates the O:C ratios, with the largest model bias in remote regions. Model performance is greatly improved by the addition of a laboratory-based oxidative-aging scheme. The revised simulations are best able to capture the observed variability of O:C in remote regions when the heterogeneous aging of secondary organic aerosol is introduced. The simulations underestimate the H:C ratios due to the gap between ambient and laboratory data. This suggests that that we may be missing sources and pathways which increase H:C, or alternatively, that laboratory experiments do not adequately mimic the ambient environment, and thus that their application in models may not reproduce field observations.",

This fact makes negative emission solutions more appealing as a part of the climate protection efforts.\nHere I use integrated assessment modeling to investigate the potential added value of air capture technologies as a complement for more conventional solutions such as carbon capture and storage, and the use of renewables. Thermodynamic limits of air capture technologies are used as a general guideline for the estimation of the performance of air capture technologies.

            "abstract": "The Hornelen basin is the largest of the Devonian 'Old Red' sandstone basins in Norway, comprising 25 km of alluvial-fluvial deposits which are organized into basin-wide, coarsening-upward megacycles. Hornelen sits with several smaller basins in the hanging wall a major extensional shear zone along which the ultra-high pressure metamorphic core of subducted Baltican crust was rapidly exhumed during the extensional collapse of the Caledonian orogeny. The timing of orogenic collapse corresponds closely to the timing of the basins, which are loosely constrained by sparse trace-fossil assemblages to a mid-Devonian age. Further, the basins are now in brittle fault contact with the underlying mylonitic shear zone and the metamorphic core, implying that they are the upper-crustal expression of large-scale extension and deep-crustal exhumation.\nTwo distinct structural models have been proposed for Hornelen to account for these observations. The strike-slip model juxtaposes different source terranes across the basin-controlling fault and predicts spatially changing provenance within chronostratigraphic units. The supradetachment model links the filling of the basin directly to unroofing of the metamorphic core on a low-angle detachment fault, and predicts basin-wide changes in provenance through time with progressive exhumation of the metamorphic hinterland.\nWe present an extensive new provenance dataset, spanning the Hornelen basin strata through space and time. Detrital zircon U/Pb ages from 18 new samples comprise three distinct populations (1.6, 1.0, and 0.43 Ga) with the Caledonian-aged zircons (ca 0.43 Ga) present mainly along the northern margin of the basin, representing an Upper Allochthon source not found on the southern or eastern margins of the basin. Juxtaposition of different source terranes across the basin supports the strike-slip model. 40Ar/39Ar detrital white mica from the same sample set documents a younging of the dominant age peak from 432 Ma in the oldest sediments to 401 Ma in the youngest units, but does not document any difference between northern and southern mica sources. This trend supports the supradetachment model, but may also be explained by passive, isostatically-driven erosional unroofing of the overthickened orogenic crust.",

            "abstract": "The Santa Monica Mountains of Southern California affords an excellent opportunity for training students on geologic imprints on stream and groundwater quality. With salinity varying from 500 mg/L TDS in streams fed from groundwater in low solubility sandstones, to 4000 mg/L TDS in streams fed from high solubility and gypsum bearing siltstones and mudstones, the role of geology on natural stream and groundwater chemistry is profound. Use of imported water from Northern California on urban landscapes that is isotopically distinct from locally sourced “native” waters provides an opportunity for students to trace and quantify the percentage of imported versus native water sources in the Santa Monica Mountains streams using stable water isotopes. Furthermore, the presence of natural selenium and uranium in certain types of strata and higher oxidation potential created by anthropogenic nitrate in groundwater provides students with opportunities to learn of trace element hydrochemistry and redox potential in natural and nutrient-contaminated strata. Teams of students have evaluated these processes in this exceptional natural hydrogeological laboratory in our Watershed Analysis, Field Methods, and Water Quality courses. The opportunities for learning hydrogeological processes in this natural field laboratory prepare students for careers in water resources in Southern California and elsewhere.",

WIFIRE may be used by wildfire management authorities in the future to predict wildfire rate of spread and direction, and assess the effectiveness of high-density sensor networks in improving fire and weather predictions. WIFIRE has created a data model for wildfire resources including sensed and archived data, sensors, satellites, cameras, modeling tools, workflows and social information including Twitter feeds. This data model and associated wildfire resource catalog includes a detailed description of the HPWREN sensor network, SDG&E’s Mesonet, and NASA MODIS. In addition, the WIFIRE data-model describes how to integrate the data from multiple heterogeneous sources to provide detailed fire-related information. The data catalog describes ‘Observables’ captured by each instrument using multiple ontologies including OGC SensorML and NASA SWEET. Observables include measurements such as wind speed, air temperature, and relative humidity, as well as their accuracy and resolution. We have implemented a REST service for publishing to and querying from the catalog using Web Application Description Language (WADL). We are creating web-based user interfaces and mobile device Apps that use the REST interface for dissemination to wildfire modeling community and project partners covering academic, private, and government laboratories while generating value to emergency officials and the general public.

            "abstract": "Monazite and zircon U/Th–Pb dating and yttrium thermometry results from metapelitic rocks of the northern East Humboldt Range, Nevada provide insight into the tectonic evolution of the North American Cordillera. Combining a petrologic approach with in situ U/Th-Pb SHRIMP geochronology gives constraints on the timing and rates of burial and exhumation. When integrated with the results from studies of the intrusive igneous and structural evolution of a complexly deformed crustal block, a broad picture of the behavior of the thickened middle crust in an orogenic wedge begins to emerge. In samples from the upper limb of the south verging Winchell Lake nappe, monazite cores giving moderate YPO4 components yield a mean U–Pb age of 82.8 ± 1.3 Ma representing initial growth near garnet zone conditions. A cycle of burial and heating giving way to decompression and melting, followed by zircon growth accompanied by low YPO4 monazite growth giving a wide range of ages (77.1–62.4 Ma) apparently documents cooling and melt crystallization. Monazite core and zircon ages from these samples bracket the time frame for this cycle through peak pressure and then temperature. Rates of burial therefore are ~1.0­–4.5 mm/year for the Winchell Lake nappe. Migmatitic pelites from the Lizzies Basin area, structurally beneath the Winchell Lake nappe give U-Pb monazite age brackets of 96.5–79.4 Ma, yielding a narrower range of burial rates, ~0.5–2.0 mm/year. Calculated exhumation rates for the same rocks from both the upper limb of the Winchell Lake nappe and the Lizzies Basin area fall between ~0.4 and 1.7 mm/year. Rapid burial followed by rapid exhumation is consistent with thickening by an overthrust mechanism followed by vertical ductile thinning, underplating, erosion, and/or normal faulting. Exhumation is generally slower than estimates for exhumation of metamorphic core complexes north of the Snake River Plain calculated by Bendick and Baldwin (2009). This may represent a difference in the crustal structure or behavior from north to south during crustal thinning following peak Cordilleran thickness. Though this technique provides estimates of the rates of tectonic processes, the exact timing of peak pressure or temperature remains elusive.",

In this paper, the development and testing of a novel three beam multifunctional direct detection lidar for air quality applications will be discussed. Operating at 1030 nm wavelength, this lidar is a nanosecond class direct detection system with three transceivers and is capable of tracking the motion of aerosol structures using elastic backscatter. Designed with scalable and modular elements and advanced algorithms and graphical user display, this lidar is tripod mounted and measures three component (3D) winds by cross correlation of aerosol backscatter from three near-parallel beams. Besides extracting multi-component wind data, the system is designed provide various atmospheric elements including turbulence. Performance of this lidar in regard to crosswind profiling has been validated with ultrasonic anemometers under low and high wind conditions. From the field data, it shown that this lidar is capable of providing relatively high spatial resolution (<1.2 m) and line-of-sight error less than 0.1 m/s over a range of greater than 2 km. With a maximum operational range of over 15 km, this lidar was recently used to study effluents from a smokestack. The results of our plume tracking study will be presented and follow-on applications for studying air emissions due to hydraulic fracturing or fracking, will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "ESA’s Rosetta spacecraft just arrived at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Since the approach in June 2014, the MIRO instrument has been acquiring two types of data: continuum emission thermal data from the nucleus at the two operating wavelengths of 190 and 562 GHz, and spectroscopic data at 562 GHz on the gas present in the coma. The two continuum channels allow for probing the temperature in the shallow subsurface over two effective depths on the order of a few millimeters to a few centimeters. The submillimeter spectrometer is sensitive to the gas molecules (H2O including oxygen isotopologues, CO, NH3, and CH3OH) emitted by the nucleus.\nThe location of the ices that are at the source of the gases found in the coma is still poorly constrained, as well as their state: pure condensate ices, hydrates or clathrate hydrates, or gas entrapped in an amorphous ice matrix. Icy grains emitting water vapor have been observed in the inner coma of comet 103P/ Hartley 2 by the EPOXI mission. Although a similar behavior might occur on 67P/ Churyumov-Gerasimenko as well, such icy grains need to be lifted off the nucleus by pre-existing gas, and thus may only represent a secondary source of the gas present in the coma. We will focus here on the potential reservoir(s) of ices within the nucleus, which is most likely the primary source of the activity.\nWe will compare the results obtained on the thermal emission of the nucleus and on the composition of the inner coma, particularly at the local/regional scale, with the phase diagrams and sublimation/dissociation rates of the various types of ices, in order to assess the location and composition of the ices in the source region(s) within the 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko nucleus.\nAcknowledgments: Part of this work has been conducted at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract to NASA.

            "abstract": "Tidal channel networks mediate the exchange of water, nutrients and sediment between an estuary and marshes and mudflats. Biology feeds back into channel morphodynamics through vegetation's influence on the cohesive strength of channel banks. Understanding the morphology of a tidal channel network is thus essential to understanding both the biological functioning of intertidal ecosystems and the topographic signature of life. A critical measure of the morphology of a channel network is the unchanneled path length, which is characteristic of the efficiency with which a network dissects the marsh platform. However, the processes which control the formation and maintenance of an efficient tidal channel network remain unclear. Here we show that an unvegetated marsh platform (Estero La Ramada, Baja California, Mexico) is dissected by a less efficient channel network than a vegetated one (Barnstable, Massachusetts, United States). The difference in geometric efficiency reflects a difference in the branching and meandering characteristics of the network, characteristics controlled by the density of vegetation on the channel banks. Our results suggest a feedback between network geometry and vegetation, mediated by fluxes of nutrients and salinity through the channel network, maintains the observed network geometries. An efficient network can support a denser vegetation community which stabilizes channel banks, leading to an efficient meandering geometry.",

The neutral wind at about 250km level observed with the 630nm airglow by Fabry-Perot interferometers of the Optical Mesosphere Thermosphere Imagers (OMTIs) is analyzed. We used the 15-minutes interval data at Shigaraki for the year 2000 to 2013. 10953 of 59881 samples became usable after a quality control.\nWe used the flare list issued by NOAA extracted from the X-rays from GOES satellites. There are 131 of X-class flares and 1510 of M-class flares during the 14 years. However, the number of samples to which effective observation of FPI is carried out at the flare peak time was 51.\nBefore composite of the wind at the time of solar flare (so-called superimposed epoc analysis), monthly climatological wind is made. First, the valid data of every month were averaged in every 15 minutes for 9-21 UTC, then, three months data were averaged. Further, the 15-minutes temporal variation data was smoothed with a Gaussian filter.\nFrom the 51 sample data containing the flare peak time, the zonal wind (Ve) and the meridional wind (Vn) were composed after deducted the above mentioned climatology with a flare peak time as the starting point (t=0). Supposing the atmosphere on the daytime side expands under the influence of the flare temporarily and the advection current to the night side is strengthened, the eastward (westward) wind should be strengthened before (after) midnight. Since the influence of the increment of the air expansion in mid-night may have been offset, the samples which flare occurs before midnight (39 samples) were composited.\nAs a result, as for Ve, significant change of eastward wind to westward wind compared to the standard deviation is observed after 3hrs and a half after solar flare occurred, while as for Vn, significant enhancement of southward component is observed after 4 hrs of the flares. Although some increments are observed after the flare to the above mentioned change for both Vn and Ve, signals are not clear. Further analysis by using other station data and other instruments are required for examination of the significance.\nThis research was done as part of Inter-university Upper atmosphere Global Observation NETwork (IUGONET).",

It was established in 1989, and has undergone several incarnations. Initially a series of seminars, it became a more formal mission design experience in 1999. Admission is competitive, with participants given financial support.\nThe competitively selected trainees develop an early mission concept study in teams of 15-17, responsive to a typical NASA Science Mission Directorate Announcement of Opportunity. They select the mission concept from options presented by the course sponsors, based on high-priority missions as defined by the Decadal Survey, prepare a presentation for a proposal authorization review, present it to a senior review board and receive critical feedback. Each participant assumes multiple roles, on science, instrument and project teams. They develop an understanding of top-level science requirements and instrument priorities in advance through a series of reading assignments and webinars help trainees. Then, during the five day session at Jet Propulsion Laboratory, they work closely with concurrent engineers including JPL's Advanced Projects Design Team (\"Team X\"), a cross-functional multidisciplinary team of engineers that utilizes concurrent engineering methodologies to complete rapid design, analysis and evaluation of mission concept designs. All are mentored and assisted directly by Team X members and course tutors in their assigned project roles. There is a strong emphasis on making difficult trades, simulating a real mission design process as accurately as possible. The process is intense and at times dramatic, with fast-paced design sessions and late evening study sessions.\nA survey of PSSS alumni administered in 2013 provides information on the program’s impact on trainees’ career choices and leadership roles as they pursue their employment in planetary science and related fields. Results will be presented during the session, along with highlights of topics and missions covered since the program’s inception.",

            "abstract": "At the end of the Cretaceous superchron, two well-dated sedimentary sequences capture in high-resolution the geomagnetic reversal process. Similar to more recent reversal records at mid-latitude sites, we observe a ~10-kyr duration in both Italy (from the extraordinarily stable Scaglia Rossa Limestone) and North America (Pierre Shale). At both sites, reversal is staggered, including transitional directions and short-lived geomagnetic excursions. Unlike reversals in the past 5 Myr, however, both sites yield reversal asymmetry, whereby the normal polarity directions prior to the transition are ~10˚ more steeply inclined, and azimuthally deflected, compared to their post-reversal counterparts. Plate motions and true polar wander, although present and appreciable, are too slow to affect the time scale of the geomagnetic deflections. Lithology in both sections is homogenous across the cm-scale reversal transition, and sedimentary inclination shallowing cannot explain the canted aspect of the asymmetry. Hence, the reversal asymmetry appears to be a feature of the C33R/C33N geomagnetic reversal process. Reversal asymmetry could suggest elevated quadrapole and/or octupole components of the geomagnetic field; however, the misfit is twice as great in declination than inclination. Non-zonal harmonics, or an offset dipole, might need to be invoked to explain the large (~20˚) declination anomalies. We suggest that the end of the superchron is marked by a profound change in core heat flux that was sufficiently large and stable to sustain localized radial convection within Earth’s outer core, creating a persistent, local deflection in Earth’s surface magnetic field.",

            "abstract": "We show that Southern Ocean (SO) temperatures in the latest generation of Earth System Models exhibit two major modes of variation, one driven by deep convection, the other by tropical variability. We perform a CMIP5 model intercomparison to understand why different climate models represent SO variability so differently in long, control simulations. We show that multiyear variability in Southern Ocean sea surface temperatures (SSTs) can in turn influence oceanic and atmospheric conditions in the tropics on short (atmospheric) time-scales. We argue that the strength and pattern of SO-tropical teleconnections depends on the intensity of SO deep convection.\nPeriodic convection in the SO is a feature of most CMIP5 models under preindustrial forcing (deLavergne et al., 2014). Models show a wide distribution in the spatial extent, periodicity and intensity of their SO convection, with some models convecting most of the time, and some showing very little convection. In a highly convective coupled model, we find that multidecadal variability in SO and global SSTs, as well as SO heat storage are driven by Weddell Sea convective variability, with convective decades relatively warm due to the heat released from the deep southern ocean and non-convective decades cold due to the subsurface storage of heat. Furthermore, pulses of SO convection drive SST and sea ice variations, influencing absorbed shortwave and emitted longwave radiation, wind, cloud and precipitation patterns, with climatic implications for the low latitudes via fast atmospheric teleconnections.\nWe suggest that these high-low latitude teleconnection mechanisms are relevant for understanding hiatus decades. Additionally, Southern Ocean deep convection varied significantly during past, natural climate changes such as during the last deglaciation. Weddell Sea open convection was recently weakened, likely as a consequence of anthropogenic forcing and the resulting surface freshening. Our study opens up the tantalizing possibility that such large-scale changes in SO deep convection might have tropical and indeed global implications via atmospheric teleconnections. We advocate the collection of both paleo and modern proxies that can verify these model-derived mechanisms and global teleconnections.",

            "abstract": "The objective of the effort reported here was the development of a method to extract the temporal signature and the individual periodic and quasi-periodic time-varying signals from proxy climate data. The effort was based on the assumption that the explicit delineation of each periodic term might ultimately be useful in helping to identify the mechanism for the 100-kyr glacial cycle in Quaternary proxy data. The method is an iterative application of both fixed and variable period filters scanned across the applicable portions of the data set. In the current application, the window for each filter is a single period wide, allowing for the maximum retention of the time-varying amplitude of the signal. An iterative process, including a time-series term, is required in order to counter the very broadband nature of the filter. Details of the method will be presented and the results of its application to the “LR04” Stack (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005) will be discussed.  Graphical correlation of the individual signals with Obliquity, Precession, and Eccentricity (Laskar, et al, 2004) will be discussed. After removal of a constant from the data, the first thru third-order time series accounts for 75% of the variability in the data. Seven statistically justifiable periodic terms account for 94% of the remaining variability. The shortest period used was the 22.2 kyr average of the 3 precession period signals identified by spectrum analysis. A very strong obliquity driven term of 41.0 kyr was also observed as expected due to tuning of the data to that term. Averaging of the spectrum analysis data was used to determine a value of 96.05 kyr for the glacial cycle. The four remaining terms had periods between 180 and 2000 kyr and were determined using the variable period filters. Shorter period terms were not used because of their excessive requirements on the degrees of freedom available in the data set.",

At the Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI) in Houston, Texas, the E/PO team holds Sky Fest outreach events several times a year. These events each have a science content theme and include several activities for children and their parents, night sky viewing through telescopes, and scientist presentations. LPI scientists have the opportunity to participate in Sky Fest events either by helping lead an activity or by giving the scientist presentation (a short lecture and/or demonstration).\nScientists are involved in at least one preparation meeting before the event. This allows them to ask questions, understand what activity they will be leading, and learn the key points that they should be sharing with the public, as well as techniques for effectively teaching members of the public about the event topic. During the event, each activity is run by one E/PO specialist and one scientist, enabling the scientist to learn about effective E/PO practices from the E/PO specialist and the E/PO specialist to get more science information about the event topic. E/PO specialists working together with scientists at stations provides a more complete, richer experience for event participants.\nSurveys of event participants have shown that interacting one-on-one with scientists is often one of their favorite parts of the events. Interviews with scientists indicated that they enjoyed Sky Fest because there was very little time involved on their parts outside of the actual event; the activities were created and/or chosen by the E/PO professionals, and setup for the events was completed before they arrived. They also enjoyed presenting their topic to people without a background in science, and who would not have otherwise sought out the information that was presented.",

            "abstract": "Cross-flow turbines, often referred to as vertical-axis turbines, show potential for success in marine hydrokinetic (MHK) and wind energy applications, ranging from small- to utility-scale installations in tidal/ocean currents and offshore wind. As turbine designs mature, the research focus is shifting from individual devices to the optimization of turbine arrays.\nIt would be expensive and time-consuming to conduct physical model studies of large arrays at large model scales (to achieve sufficiently high Reynolds numbers), and hence numerical techniques are generally better suited to explore the array design parameter space. However, since the computing power available today is not sufficient to conduct simulations of the flow in and around large arrays of turbines with fully resolved turbine geometries (e.g., grid resolution into the viscous sublayer on turbine blades), the turbines’ interaction with the energy resource (water current or wind) needs to be parameterized, or modeled. Models used today--a common model is the actuator disk concept--are not able to predict the unique wake structure generated by cross-flow turbines. This wake structure has been shown to create \"constructive\" interference in some cases, improving turbine performance in array configurations, in contrast with axial-flow, or horizontal axis devices.\nTowards a more accurate parameterization of cross-flow turbines, an extensive experimental study was carried out using a high-resolution turbine test bed with wake measurement capability in a large cross-section tow tank. The experimental results were then \"interpolated\" using high-fidelity Navier--Stokes simulations, to gain insight into the turbine's near-wake. The study was designed to achieve sufficiently high Reynolds numbers for the results to be Reynolds number independent with respect to turbine performance and wake statistics, such that they can be reliably extrapolated to full scale and used for model validation. The end product of this work will be a cross-flow turbine actuator line model to be used as an extension to the OpenFOAM computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software framework, which will likely require modifications to commonly-used dynamic stall models, in consideration of the turbines' high angle of attack excursions during normal operation.",

            "abstract": "Inference of spatially distributed reservoir and aquifer properties from scattered and spatially limited data poses a poorly constrained nonlinear inverse problem that can have many solutions. In particular, the uncertainty in the geologic continuity model can remarkably degrade the quality of fluid displacement predictions, hence, the efficiency of resource development plans. For model calibration, instead of estimating aquifer properties for each grid cell in the model, the sparse representation of the aquifer properties is estimated from nonlinear production data. The resulting calibration problem can be solved using recent developments in sparse signal processing, widely known as compressed sensing. This novel formulation leads to a sparse data inversion technique that effectively searches for relevant geologic patterns that can explain the available spatiotemporal data.\nWe recently introduced a new model calibration framework by using sparse geologic dictionaries that are constructed from uncertain prior geologic models. Here, we first demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed sparse geologic dictionaries for flexible and robust model calibration under prior geologic uncertainty. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in using limited nonlinear production data to identify a consistent geologic scenario from a number of candidate scenarios, which is usually a challenging problem in geostatistical reservoir characterization. We then evaluate the feasibility of adopting this framework for field application. In particular, we present subsurface field model calibration applications in which sparse geologic dictionaries are learned from uncertain prior information on large-scale reservoir property descriptions. We consider two large-scale field case studies, the Brugges and the Norne field examples. We discuss the construction of geologic dictionaries for large-scale problems and present reduced-order methods to speed up the computational aspect of the algorithm for field applications. Our results show that sparse geologic dictionaries offer a promising approach for field-scale data integration applications where the trade-offs between model dimensionality, computation speed, and geologic model plausibility should be reconciled effectively.",

Although many studies have tested possible mechanisms underlying plant “priming” of decomposition, few have investigated the microbial mediators of decomposition, which can be greatly influenced by plant activities. Here we examined effects of Avena fatua roots on decomposition of 13C-labeled root litter in a California grassland soil over two simulated growing-seasons. The presence of plant roots consistently suppressed rates of litter decomposition. Reduction of inorganic nitrogen (N) concentration in soil reduced but did not completely relieve this suppressive effect. The presence of plants significantly altered the abundance, composition and functional potential of microbial communities. Significantly higher signal intensities of genes capable of degrading low molecular weight organic compounds (e.g., glucose, formate and malate) were observed in microbial communities from planted soils, while microorganisms in unplanted soils had higher relative abundances of genes involved in degradation of some macromolecules (e.g., hemicellulose and lignin). Additionally, compared to unplanted soils, microbial communities from planted soils had higher signal intensities of proV and proW, suggesting microbial osmotic stress in planted soils. Possible mechanisms for the observed inhibition of decomposition are 1) microbes preferentially using simple substrates from root exudates and 2) soil drying by plant evapotranspiration impairing microbial activity. We propose a simple data-based model suggesting that the impacts of roots, the soil environment, and microbial community composition on decomposition processes result from impacts of these factors on the soil microbial functional gene potential.",

The BMP was implemented by raising the spillage levels using drainage structures in the ditch that drained the wetland and upland areas. Four-year pre-BMP and 5-year post-BMP data from Site 1 and 3-year pre-BMP and 6-year post-BMP data from Site 2 were used to evaluate the BMP. We compared runoff, Total phosphorus (TP) and Total nitrogen (TN) loads and concentrations between pre- and post-BMP periods. Compared to pre-BMP, annual post-BMP runoff reduced for Site 1 (60%) and Site 2 (54%). These reductions were only statistically significant for Site 2 (p = 0.096). For the wetter part of the rainy season (July-October), when damaging excessive flows to the LO occur, the post-BMP runoff reduced significantly (p= 0.049) for Site 1 but not for Site 2. Reductions were mainly due to increased water storage while the reductions in nutrient loads and average concentrations were due to reduced runoff volume as well as P retention by soil and plants. Despite reductions in average concentrations, the wet-season post-BMP TP flow weighted concentration (FWC) increased significantly (p= 0.05) at Site 1. Increased TP FWC was likely due to increased inundation in wetland and its connectivity with upland pasture during the post-BMP period. This connectivity increased the surface transport of P, the preferred mode for particulate and dissolved P transport. Unlike Site 1, the TP FWC at Site 2 decreased significantly (p = 0.002) during the wet season due to absence of P hotspots and their connectivity to the wetland. Results indicate that while pasture WR can reduce runoff from the ranchlands, it may increase the TP loads depending on the topographic and drainage characteristics and presence of P hotspots within a ranch.",

This type of heterogeneous structure has been referred to as the connected-network paradigm (Fogg et al., 2000). In addition, quite commonly the total K distribution is comprised predominantly or substantially of aquitard materials (e.g., silts and clays, or, in the case of gravelly deposits, fine sands and silts). Because there are many more observations in the aquifers than the non-aquifer materials, a number of observation biases ensue, including underestimating the variance of K, lack of detection of the fastest moving solutes in connected high K channels, lack of detection of solute mass in non-aquifer materials. In turn, especially when the systems are modeled with Fickian assumptions, the observation biases lead to model biases, including underprediction of solute first breakthrough and of time scales for contaminant remediation or retention by the aquifer system. Further, environmental tracers are frequently used to calibrate regional transport models, but these groundwater age estimation tools are biased in that most of them sample only the youngest (<~50 yr) fraction of a mixture of groundwater ages per sample, neglecting the commonly important intermediate age waters (>50 to ~3,000 yr). This groundwater age estimation problem is yet another observation bias that may be confounding attempts to build more realistic, regional transport models. Importantly, even non-Fickian models will not capture the above effects if the observation biases, are not recognized and corrected. Examples of the various observation and resultant model biases will be presented and discussed along with the proposition that the connected-network paradigm, and hence non-Fickian transport, is the rule rather than the exception. Lastly, the resulting need for more subsurface transport observatories will be asserted.",

            "abstract": "Experiments at the Department of Energy’s Rifle, CO (USA) field site have long focused on stimulated biogeochemical pathways arising from organic carbon injection. While reductive pathways and their relation to uranium immobilization have been a focus since 2002, ongoing studies are exploring oxidative pathways and their role in mediating fluxes of C, N, S, and aqueous metals. Insights gained from ‘stimulation’ experiments are providing insight into analogous natural biogeochemical pathways that mediate elemental cycling in the absence of exogenous carbon. Such reactions are instead mediated by endogenous pools of natural organic matter (NOM) deposited during aggradation of aquifer sediments associated with fluvial processes within the Colorado River floodplain. Discrete lenses of fine-grained, organic-rich sediments enriched in reduced species, such as Fe(II) and iron sulfides have been identified along the active margin of the floodplain. Referred to as “naturally reduced zones” (NRZs), these localities constitute a distinct facies type within an otherwise gravel-dominated, largely NOM-deficient matrix. NRZs represent ‘hotspots’ of seasonally intense C, N, S, and U cycling during excursions in groundwater elevation. Air bubble imbibition within the capillary fringe is inferred to contribute to seasonally oxic groundwater, with its puntuated, ‘hot moment’ like impact on redox-mediated reactions exhibiting close correspondence to those induced through the intentional introduction of oxidants. Reactions induce sharp gradients in nitrate and sulfate resulting from elevated rates of nitrification and oxidation of reduced sulfur as dissolved oxygen becomes non-limiting. Given their outsized role in constraining the location and timing of critcal element cycling pathways, delineating the distribution of NRZs across scales of relevance to natural field systems is of great importance. Novel mapping approaches borrowed from the field of exploration geophysics provide one means for identifying such ‘hotspots’ across a variety of environments where their formation is favored. Drilling activities and deployment of monitoring approaches to study cycling pathways of interest and as a function of hydrologic perturbation may then be performed in a targeted and scientificlally-informed manner.",

            "abstract": "Boreal and arctic terrestrial ecosystem is a unique ecological region due to large portion of wetland and permafrost distribution. Increasing disturbances, like permafrost-thaw, fire event, climate extreme, would greatly change the patterns and variations of greenhouse gas emission and further affect the feedback between terrestrial ecosystem and climate change. Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) accounted for more than 85% of the radioactive forcing (RF) due to long-lived greenhouse gases. However, few studies have considered the full budget of three gases together in this region. In this study, we used a process-based model (Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model), driven by multiple global change factors, to quantify the magnitude, spatial and temporal variation of CO2, CH4 and N2O across the boreal and arctic regions. Simulated results have been evaluated against field observations, inventory-based and atmospheric inversion estimates. By implementing a set of factorial simulations, we further quantify the relative contribution of climate, atmospheric composition, fire to the CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes. Continued warming climate potentially could shift the inter-annual and intra-annual variation of greenhouse gases fluxes. The understanding of full budget in this region could provide insights for reasonable future projection, which is also crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies of tropical glaciers have shown that most are retreating rapidly, with some of the most dramatic changes occurring since the mid-1970s, most likely as a result of increasing global temperatures. However, a longer-term perspective is needed to place these changes in the context of natural climate variability. To better understand the climatological factors driving long-term variations in the mass balance of tropical glaciers, we reconstructed changes in precipitation and temperature in the northern tropical Andes using variations in the hydrogen isotope composition of sedimentary leaf waxes and branched GDGT distributions in a high-resolution varved sediment record from Lago Chingaza, Colombia. Br-GDGT derived temperatures are significantly correlated with instrumental temperature data and indicate that recent warming in the northern tropical Andes is unprecedented over the past two millennia. Furthermore, the magnitude of warming since the Little Ice Age is substantially larger than suggested by high latitude temperature reconstructions. Hydrogen isotope data indicated that colder conditions during the Little Ice Age were accompanied by a decrease in rainfall, likely associated with a southward shift in the position of the ITCZ. Over the past few centuries, warmer temperatures were accompanied by an increase in rainfall and a northward expansion of the tropical rainbelt. Together, these data suggest that the dominant control on the retreat of Andean glaciers has been the unprecedented rate and magnitude of recent warming.",

            "abstract": "Biomass burning represents one of the largest global sources of absorbing aerosol. Despite the importance of biomass burning emissions on the Earth’s radiative balance, there remains significant uncertainty about the optical properties of emitted particles. Of particular interest is the impact of lensing on black carbon absorption and the impact of brown carbon. This presentation describes results from the Fire Lab at Missoula Experiment-4 (FLAME-4), which occurred in October 2012. Multi-channel photoacoustic (PAS) and Cavity Ringdown (CRDS) spectrometers were used to measure absorption, extinction, and absorption enhancement of aerosol particles produced from a wide range of globally relevant biomass fuels. Measurements were made at 405, 532, and 660 nm with duplicate channels at 405 and 660 measuring denuded particles, allowing for direct observation of the enhancement of absorption by black carbon particles caused by clear and brown organic coatings. Fuels were chosen based on their contribution to global wildfire emissions and a wide range of fuels will be discussed including some of the first optical measurements of Indonesian peat. The SSA and absorption angstrom exponent (AAE) of different biomass fuels will be explored and the relative importance of black and brown carbon emitted from different biomass fuels will be assessed, demonstrating that for certain fuels absorption from brown carbon is as important, or even more important than absorption from black carbon.",

            "abstract": "Major drivers of changes in forested ecosystems of northeastern Mongolia are fire, climate, and humans. However, specific interactions and impacts of these three factors are poorly known. Such information is critical for forecasting future ecosystem change in light of climate change, and for more informed management in light of increased human use of natural ecosystems. We reconstructed centuries-long fire histories in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L) forests in northeastern Mongolia using tree-ring data, and compared them to both human and climate histories to examine past interactions of these three factors. Reconstructed fire events were recorded in a total of 209 samples collected from 28 sites spanning 1650-2009. The results clearly showed fires were frequent from the beginnings of the records to the early 1900s, with mean fire intervals of 11-12 years (minimum fire intervals of 6-8 years). Mean fire intervals changed to 20-22 years after the 1920s, and several sites showed probable impacts of fire suppression efforts after the end of WWII. However, after the end of Soviet influence on fire suppression efforts after 1990, fire occurrences in all sites picked up again. The reconstructed hydroclimatic data showed that this region has experienced wet conditions during the 20th century, and droughts in the early 21st century are not severe as relative to previous centuries. Superposed epoch analysis (SEA) examined climate effects on these reconstructed fire events showed that climate is definitely playing a main role in regional fire years in forests of Northeast Mongolia.These result document that fires have always been present and frequent in Mongolia Scots pine forests, but have varied through time both in response to variations in climate and human forcings. These data also serve to guide fire and forest management into the future as climate and human land use pressures change. ",

            "abstract": "A number of studies during the last few decades were devoted to the artificial upwelling powered by surface waves. Potential applications of this system include an increase of supply of nutrients to the surface water to support sea farming and a local reduction of surface temperature in coastal waters. The system represents a pipeline attached to a buoy. Pumping of deep water takes place due to a valve located at the top end of the tube (Vershinsky et al. 1984; Liu et al. 1999). On the way up the system pumps deep water and on the way down it ejects the deep water in the surface layer. This system can be classified as a wave-driven inertial pump and is very effective in bringing deeper water to the surface. However, the deep water has tendency to sink, producing an effluent plume. In this work, a prototype, 3D computational fluid dynamics model of the wave-driven artificial upwelling has been developed. The model is implemented in the ANSYS Fluent software and is able to simulate dynamics of the wave following buoy system and dilution of the deep water in the upper layer of the ocean under various stratification and surface wave conditions. The model results are compared with available field data.\nLiu, C.C.K., Dai, J., Lin, H., and Guo, F. (1999). Hydrodynamic performance of wave-drive artificial upwelling, J. Engrg.

Investigating cases of remote triggering offers the opportunity to improve our knowledge about the physical mechanisms of earthquake interaction and nucleation. Furthermore, the similarities observed between remotely triggered NVT and those related to slow slip events, suggest that investigating triggered NVT may give us important insights into the mechanisms involved in slow slip events and their potential role in the earthquake cycle. In this work we present new results and the techniques we employ in identifying, locating and modeling cases of triggered earthquakes and NVT in Latin America and the Caribbean. In particular, we use global and regional seismic networks to perform an intensive search for triggered seismicity in Mexico, Cuba, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. Our results suggest that seismicity can be triggered in a broad variety of tectonic environments, depending strongly on the triggering dynamic stress amplitude and orientation. This investigation will help to define the regions where remote triggering occurs and their susceptibility to undergo an important increase in seismicity after the occurrence of a distant large earthquake.",

This regularization property is used to select\nprior models that better reconstruct the complex geo-spatial connectivity during calibration. With\ngroup sparsity, the dominant spatial connectivity patterns are encoded into several parameter\ngroups where each group is tuned to represent certain types of geologic patterns.

There is a two-way interaction between propagating convection and the environment: the large scale circulation controls the characteristics of propagating convection, while any changes in the spectrum of the propagating precipitation events imply an upscale feedback to the large scale disturbances. These important interactions warrant continued investigation of the spectrum of tropical convective systems, particularly as current climate models advance and parameterizations continually mature. Our work focuses on the characteristics of convection event life cycles, factors that control event propagation, and aspects of feedback to the environment in TWP.\nAll precipitation events are observed within a 4-yr (2006.4-2010.4) period over TWP. Events are categorized according to their longevity. Events start from relatively warm SST and optimal shear, and terminate at cooler SSTs and decreased shear. The extent to which wind shear and small-scale convergence boundaries and/or cold pool dynamics influence the event propagation direction is investigated. SST/moisture along the path, representing the potential energy, amplifies or dissipates the precipitation events. TRMM Precipitation shows a clear evolution of the convection structure as events propagate. The rainfall event lifecycle starts from shallow cumulus clusters, evolves to unorganized deep clusters within 6 hours, then increases in organization and dissipates to stratiform by the end.\nPrecipitation system diabatic heating (Q1) and moistening (Q2) terms are calculated from the TRMM Spectral LH product. The maximum level for heat release is near 5km. Two dominant peaks in moistening occur: one within the PBL and the other near LCL. The feedbacks of different convective cloud clusters to the large-scale environment are different; shallow convection helps to transport heat and moisture to the mid-troposphere, while deep convection consumes the mid-troposphere energy.\nAccurate analysis of the global heat and momentum budgets critically depends on an adequate understanding of propagating convective systems. This study highlight the importance of properly modeling precipitation events in order to achieve realistic global climate model simulations.",

            "abstract": "I will present the accumulation of over 10 years of experience teaching STEM subjects to students ranging from 1st grade to graduate school. I was fortunate to gain a lot of valuable teaching experience while in graduate school in Boulder, CO and so many of my experiences center on opportunities for connecting with students in the field in CO.\n3rd-5th grade field hikes – While helping at Jamestown Elementary School, I led hikes with a 3-5th grade class to an abandoned flourospar mine where the students were able to pick up beautiful purple fluorite crystals from the ground while discussing how mining works. During the hike back, we used field meters to measure the pH and conductivity of the stream and discussed the need to balance society’s need for metals with the harmful effects of acid mine drainage.\n9th, 10th grade STEM Academy at Skyline High School – During an NSF-sponsored fellowship, I had the opportunity to teach a STEM class to 9th and 10th graders where we used the engineering design process to a) design a tool to help a handicapped 3rd grader use the drinking fountain by herself and b) design a treatment system for cleaning up acid mine drainage.\nUndergraduate and Graduate Environmental Water Chemistry Field Trip – Students had the opportunity to tour two local mine sites to collect contaminated water that would be used in class for alkalinity titrations and pH, sulfate, and hardness measurements. They also collected water samples upstream and at multiple points downstream of a wastewater treatment plan and measured and graphed the dissolved oxygen “sag” in the river.\nMy main teaching philosophy has two parts: 1) assume the students know nothing and 2) assume the students are even smarter than you think you are. This informs my approach to field trips by always starting from the beginning, but also not oversimplifying the topic. 1st graders on their best day can be very similar to graduate students on their worst.",

This unique and comprehensive long-term hydroclimatic dataset, as maintained by the Illinois State Water Survey since 1980’s covering the areas for the entire state, includes daily-to-monthly observational networks of precipitation, streamflow, snow, soil moisture and the depth to water table. The focus of this talk is on characterizing the significance of (shallow) GW in terrestrial water and energy cycles. Baseflow is estimated by using multiple techniques for baseflow separation, and the results are compared in order to estimate the uncertainty involved in this study. GW recharge is then estimated from the GW budget equation. The interactions between SM and GW is investigated based on estimated GW recharge. Also, GW-supported evapotranspiration is quantified and its role in sustaining dry-season (summer) evaporation is highlighted. Due to their similar order of magnitude, the incorporation of both SM and GW storages is indispensable for regional water balance estimation in humid areas such as Illinois, since GW aquifers provide a significant portion of terrestrial water storage changes at the monthly to interannual timescale.",

            "abstract": "Deep crustal structure, particularly the geometry of shear zones, affects the degree of crust-mantle coupling and the kinematics of crustal deformation. In principle, shear zones in the deep crust can be visible using seismic imaging due to the change in the orientations and modes of anisotropic minerals. However, matching the seismic signals to structures present remains a challenge. This work seeks to bridge some of that gap.\nWe utilize the Parry Sound domain in the western Central Gneiss Belt of the Grenville orogen, Ontario, Canada, to develop quantitative relationships between geologic structures and seismic anisotropy. This region provides excellent examples of granulite and amphibolite facies shear zones up to several km wide. We investigated three rock types: (1) regionally deformed mafic and felsic granulite facies orthogneiss, (2) granulite facies shear zones, and (3) amphibolite facies shear zones. Both of the latter two derived from (1). Using the numerical architecture of asymptotic expansion homogenization (which considers grain-scale elastic interactions), we computed much higher precision seismic velocities than is possible with conventional Voigt-Reuss-Hill algorithms. In all sheared felsic rocks, the dominant quartz slip system was prism <a> + rhomb <a> indicating slowest Vp direction paralleled lineation because in quartz a-axis is near the slowest direction. In contrast, in all sheared mafic rocks, the fastest amphibole direction is strongly parallel to the lineation. As a consequence of combining the quartz and amphibole deformation, rocks comprising felsic and mafic layers have a weak seismic anisotropy. In monolithological shear zones, anisotropy can exceed 10%. Despite the promise this work illustrates, we must continue to consider the influence of inherited fabrics in the host rock. In a second line of investigation, we explored how shear zone volume fraction affects seismic anisotropy.",

            "abstract": "Most parameterizations of microbial dynamics and pathogen transport in surface waters rely on classic assumptions of advection-diffusion behavior in the water column and limited interactions between the water column and sediments. However, recent studies have shown that strong surface-subsurface interactions produce a wide range of transport timescales in rivers, and greatly the opportunity for long-term retention of pathogens in sediment beds and benthic biofilms. We present a stochastic model for pathogen dynamics, based on continuous-time random walk theory, that properly accounts for such diverse transport timescales, along with the remobilization and inactivation of pathogens in storage reservoirs. By representing pathogen dynamics probabilistically, the model framework enables diverse local-scale processes to be incorporated in system-scale models. We illustrate the application of the model to microbial dynamics in rivers based on the results of a tracer injection experiment. In-stream transport and surface-subsurface interactions are parameterized based on observations of conservative tracer transport, while E. coli retention and inactivation in sediments is parameterized based on direct local-scale experiments. The results indicate that sediments are an important reservoir of enteric organisms in rivers, and slow remobilization from sediments represents a long-term source of bacteria to streams. Current capability, potential advances, and limitations of this model framework for assessing pathogen transmission risks will be discussed. Because the transport model is probabilistic, it is amenable to incorporation into risk models, but a lack of characterization of key microbial processes in sediments and benthic biofilms hinders current application.",

            "abstract": "Traditional introductory STEM courses often reinforce misconceptions because the large scale of many classes forces a structured, lecture-centric model of teaching that emphasizes delivery of facts rather than exploration, inquiry, and scientific reasoning. This problem is especially acute in teaching about the co-evolution of Earth and life, where classroom learning and textbook teaching are far removed from the immersive and affective aspects of field-based science, and where the challenges of taking large numbers of students into the field make it difficult to expose them to the complex context of the geologic record.\nWe are exploring the potential of digital technologies and online delivery to address this challenge, using immersive and engaging virtual environments that are more like games than like lectures, grounded in active learning, and deliverable at scale via the internet. The goal is to invert the traditional lecture-centric paradigm by placing lectures at the periphery and inquiry-driven, integrative virtual investigations at the center, and to do so at scale.\nTo this end, we are applying a technology platform we devised, supported by NASA and the NSF, that integrates a variety of digital media in a format that we call an immersive virtual field trip (iVFT). In iVFTs, students engage directly with virtual representations of real field sites, with which they interact non-linearly at a variety of scales via game-like exploration while guided by an adaptive tutoring system. This platform has already been used to develop pilot iVFTs useful in teaching anthropology, archeology, ecology, and geoscience.\nWith support the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, we are now developing and evaluating a coherent suite of ~ 12 iVFTs that span the sweep of life’s history on Earth, from the 3.8 Ga metasediments of West Greenland to ancient hominid sites in East Africa. These iVFTs will teach fundamental principles of geology and practices of scientific inquiry, and expose students to the evidence from which evolutionary and paleoenvironmental inferences are derived. In addition to making these iVFT available to the geoscience community for EPO, we will evaluate the comparative effectiveness of iVFT and traditional lecture and lab approaches to achieving geoscience learning objectives.",

            "abstract": "Sliding and flowing are the major movement type after slope failures. Landslides occur when slope-froming material moves downhill after failing along a sliding surface. Most debris flows originally occur in the form of rainfall-induced landslides before they move into valley channel. Landslides that mobilize into debris flows usually are characterized by high-speed movement and long run-out distance and may present the greatest risk to human life. The 22 March 2014 Oso landslide is a typical case of landside transformint to debris flow. The landslide was triggered on the edge of a plateau about 200 m high composed of glacial sediments after excessive prolonged rainfall of 348 in March 2014. After its initiation, portions of the landslide materials transitioned into a rapidly moving debris flow which traveled long distances across the downslope floodplain. U.S. Geological Survey estimated the volume of the slide to be about 7 million m3, and it traveled about 1 km from the toe of the slope. The apparent friction angle measured by the energy line drawn from the crown of the head scarp to the toe of the deposits which reached largest distance, was only 5~6 degrees. we performed two numerical modeling to predicting the runout distance and to get insight into the behaviour of the landslide movement. One is GIS-based revised Hovland’s 3D limit equilibrium model which is used to simulate the movement and stoppage of a landslide. In this research, sliding is defined by a slip surface which cuts through the slope, causing the mass of earth to move above it. The factor of safety will be calculated step by step during the sliding process simulation. Stoppage is defined by the factor of safety much greater than one and the velocity equal zero. The other is GIS-based depth-averaged 2D numerical model using a coupled viscous and Coulomb type law to simulate a debris flow from initiation to deposition. We compared our simulaiton results with the results of preliminary computer simulation of the Oso landslide movement which was produced by David L. George and Richard M. Iverson on April 10, 2014.",

Herein we investigate the effect of surface and subsurface structural anomalies on the detectability of potential shallow aquifers for the case of Europa ice penetrating radars. We investigate the surface and volume scattering effects arising from the cratering, geothermal and ice tectonic structural elements associated with Europa’s geological evolution. Using the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method we modeled the radar wave propagation through Europa’s subsurface in the frequency range from 9 to 30 MHz for two Europa geoelectrical models representing the thermally conductive and convective subsurface models. These geoelectrical models are then meshed to match the subsurface structural models for the most common two types of terrains on Europa, i.e. the Double Ridges and the Chaos Terrain, represented. Our simulations suggest that shallow aquifer detection in the first 3 km of the Europa subsurface can be achieved in most types of terrains for the conductive models and derive the constraints for its detectability in the terrains that are hypothesized to be formed from convective thermal activity. Both the large subsurface fractures and the brittle-ductile interface and their slopes variation are also possible to detect in the simulated radargrams for various surface roughness conditions. Our results suggests that quantifying the surface and volume scattering effects arising respectively from topographic and roughness conditions and subsurface structural anomalies through FDTD simulations is crucial to optimize the future sounding radar orbital data acquisitions. We will also present the added value of using interferometric and passive acquisitions to reduce the ambiguities of the complex clutter and maximize subsurface detectability of aquifers.",

Fire regimes, ecosystem fuels, fire severity and intensity vary widely, even within the same system, largely under the control of weather and climate. These strongly influence fire plume injection height and thus the transport of related biomass burning emissions, affecting air quality, human health and the climate system.\nIf our knowledge of plume injection height is incorrect, transport models of those emissions will likewise be incorrect, adversely affecting our ability to analyze and predict climate feedbacks (i.e. black carbon to the Arctic, precipitation, cloud-radiation relationships) and public health (air quality forecast).\nHistorically, plume height was based on the pioneering work of G.A. Briggs [1969; 1971] and verified with limited field campaigns. However, we currently have two satellite instruments, Cloud-Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) onboard CALIPSO (afternoon overpass) and Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) onboard TERRA (morning overpass), that can provide the statistics necessary to verify our assumptions and improve fire plume injection height estimates for use in both small- and large-scale models.\nWe have developed a methodology to assess fire plume injection height using the Langley Trajectory Model (LaTM), CALIOP, Hazard Mapping System (HMS) smoke plume, and MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) thermal anomaly data that is capable of generating two distinct types of verification data. A single CALIOP smoke-filled aerosol envelop can be traced back to numerous fire events, and using multiple CALIOP transects from numerous days, a daily smoke plume injection height evolution from a single fire can be defined. Additionally, we have linked the smoke plumes to ecosystems and the meteorological variables that define fire weather.\nIn concert, CALIOP and MISR data can produce the statistical knowledge necessary to improve our understanding of the dynamics of fire plume injection height, thus improving our ability to forecast poor air quality and to accurately define smoke feedbacks to climate change.",

The Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) is designed to collect high-resolution aerial imagery, waveform and discrete LiDAR, and high-fidelity imaging spectroscopic data over the NEON sites annually at or near peak-greenness. Three individual airborne sensor packages will be installed in leased Twin Otter aircraft and used to the collect the NEON sites as NEON enters operations. A key driver to the derived remote sensing data products is the calibration of the imaging spectrometers. This is essential to the overall NEON mission to detect changes in the collected ecosystems over the 30-year expected lifetime.\nThe NEON Imaging Spectrometer (NIS) is a Visible and Shortwave Infrared (VSWIR) grating spectrometer designed by NASA JPL. Spectroscopic data is collected at 5-nm intervals from 380-2500-nm. A single 480 by 640 pixel HgCdTe Focal Plane Array collects dispersed light from a grating tuned for efficiency across the solar-reflective utilized in a push-broom configuration. Primary calibration of the NIS consists of the characterizing the FPA behavior, spectral calibration, and radiometric calibration. To this end, NEON is constructing a Sensor Test Facility to calibrate the NEON sensors. This work discusses the initial NIS laboratory calibration and verification using vicarious calibration techniques during operations. Laboratory spectral calibration is based on well-defined emission lines in conjunction with a scanning monochromator to define the individual spectral response functions. A NIST traceable FEL bulb is used to radiometrically calibrate the imaging spectrometer. An On-board Calibration (OBC) system is used to monitor the behavior of the NIS throughout flight operations. In addition, results are discussed from a vicarious calibration campaign at Railroad Valley Playa in Nevada collected during a Landsat 8 overpass.",

            "abstract": "Inexpensive and robust space-weather monitoring instruments are needed to fill upcoming gaps in the Nation’s ability to meet requirements for space weather specification and forecasting. Foremost among the needed data are electric fields, since they drive global ionospheric and thermospheric behavior, and because there are relatively few ground-based measurements. We envisage a constellation of CubeSats to provide global coverage of the electric field and its variability.\nThe DICE (Dynamic Ionosphere CubeSat Experiment) mission was a step towards this goal, with two identical 1.5U CubeSats, each carrying three space weather instruments: (1) double probe instruments to measure AC and DC electric fields; (2) Langmuir probes to measure ionospheric electron density, and; (3) a magnetometer to measure field-aligned currents. DICE launched in October 2011. DICE was the first CubeSat mission to observe a Storm Enhanced Density event, fulfilling a major goal of the mission.\nDue to attitude control anomalies encountered in orbit, the DICE electric field booms have not yet been deployed. Important lessons have been learned for the implementation of a spin-stabilized CubeSat, and the design and performance of the Attitude Determination & Control System (ADCS). These lessons are now being applied to the DIME SensorSat, a risk-reduction mission that is capable of deploying flexible electric field booms up to a distance of 10-m tip-to-tip from a 1.5U CubeSat. DIME will measure AC and DC electric fields, and will exceed several IORD-2 threshold requirements. Ion densities, and magnetic fields will also be measured to characterize the performance of the sensor in different plasma environments.\nWe show the utility of a constellation of electric field measurements, describe the DIME SensorSat, and demonstrate how the measurement will meet or exceed IORD requirements. The reduced cost of these sensors will enable constellations that can, for the first time, adequately resolve the spatial and temporal variability in ionospheric electrodynamics.\nDICE and DIME are collaborations between ASTRA and Space Dynamics Lab/Utah State University.",

            "abstract": "Widespread flooding is a major problem in the Philippines. The country experiences heavy amount of rainfall throughout the year and several areas are prone to flood hazards because of its unique topography. Human casualties and destruction of infrastructure are some of the damages caused by flooding and the country’s government has undertaken various efforts to mitigate these hazards. One of the solutions was to create flood hazard maps of different floodplains and use them to predict the possible catastrophic results of different rain scenarios. To produce these maps, different types of data were needed and part of that is calculating hydrological components to come up with an accurate output. This paper presents how an important parameter, the time-to-peak of the watershed (Tp) was calculated. Time-to-peak is defined as the time at which the largest discharge of the watershed occurs. This is computed by using a lag time equation that was developed specifically for the Philippine setting. The equation involves three measurable parameters, namely, watershed length (L), maximum potential retention (S), and watershed slope (Y). This approach is based on a similar method developed by CH2M Hill and Horritt for Taiwan, which has a similar set of meteorological and hydrological parameters with the Philippines. Data from fourteen water level sensors covering 67 storms from all the regions in the country were used to estimate the time-to-peak. These sensors were chosen by using a screening process that considers the distance of the sensors from the sea, the availability of recorded data, and the catchment size. Values of Tp from the different sensors were generated from the general lag time equation based on the Natural Resource Conservation Management handbook by the US Department of Agriculture. The calculated Tp values were plotted against the values obtained from the equation L0.8(S+1)0.7/Y0.5. Regression analysis was used to obtain the final equation that would be used to calculate the time-to-peak specifically for rivers in the Philippine setting. The calculated values could then be used as a parameter for modeling different flood scenarios in the country.",

            "abstract": "In order to better understand and predict environmental hazards of weather/climate, ecology and deep earth processes, geoscientists develop and use physics-based computational models. These models are used widely both in academic and federal communities. Because of the large effort required to develop and test models, there is widespread interest in component-based modeling, which promotes model reuse and simplified coupling to tackle problems that often cross discipline boundaries. In component-based modeling, the goal is to make relatively small changes to models that make it easy to reuse them as \"plug-and-play\" components. Sophisticated modeling frameworks exist to rapidly couple these components to create new composite models. They allow component models to exchange variables while accommodating different programming languages, computational grids, time-stepping schemes, variable names and units.\nModeling frameworks have arisen in many modeling communities. CSDMS (Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System) serves the academic earth surface process dynamics community, while ESMF (Earth System Modeling Framework) serves many federal Earth system modeling projects. Others exist in both the academic and federal domains and each satisfies design criteria that are determined by the community they serve. While they may use different interface standards or semantic mediation strategies, they share fundamental similarities. The purpose of the Earth System Bridge project is to develop mechanisms for interoperability between modeling frameworks, such as the ability to share a model or service component. This project has three main goals: (1) Develop a Framework Description Language (ES-FDL) that allows modeling frameworks to be described in a standard way so that their differences and similarities can be assessed. (2) Demonstrate that if a model is augmented with a framework-agnostic Basic Model Interface (BMI), then simple, universal adapters can go from BMI to a modeling framework's native component interface. (3) Create semantic mappings between modeling frameworks that support semantic mediation. This third goal involves creating a crosswalk between the CF Standard Names and the CSDMS Standard Names (a set of naming conventions). This talk will summarize progress towards these goals.",

Few quantitative observations exist that resolve the plume dynamics of active wildfires. Our observations elucidate three important and poorly understood aspects of convective columns: (1) column rotation, (2) penetrative convection, and (3) deep pyrocumulus clouds. Our first observational case examines vigorus anti-cyclonic rotation that occurred in a rapidly developing wildfire. The convective column was first purely convergent, then as the fire intensified, the column acquired strong (+/- 15 m s-1) anticyclonic rotation. The Doppler lidar recorded the vortex structure, strength, and evolution, including the merger of smaller vorticies into a single long-lived vortex. The second case examines the interaction of the convective plumes with shear layers and capping stable layers. These data show explosive convective growth as fire-induced buoyancy penetrated into the free troposphere. Observations of entrainment into the plumes is expecitly resolved in the lidar scans. The final case examines rarely observed deep pyrocumulus clouds associated with an intense forest fire. The lidar data reveal plume structure, including t the height of the lifted condensation level and the full height of the plume top which was in excess of 8 km AGL.",

            "abstract": "Soil carbon (C) cycling is linked to the availability of nutrients like nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). However, the role of soil P in influencing soil C turnover and accumulation is poorly understood, with most models focusing on C:N ratios based on the assumption that terrestrial ecosystems are N limited. To determine the effects of N and P availability on soil C turnover, we compared soil respiration over the course of a growing season in four adjacent rice fields with 5%, 10%, 20% and 25% soil C. In each of these fields, plots were established to test the effect of N additions on plant growth, using control and N addition treatments (80 kg N/ha urea). Although soil P was not manipulated in parallel, prior work has shown soil P concentrations decline markedly with increasing soil C content. Soil CO2 flux was monitored using static chambers at biweekly intervals during the growing season, along with porewater dissolved organic C and ammonium. Soils were collected at the end of the growing season, and tested for total C, N, and P, extractable N and P, pH, base cations and trace metals. Soil DNA was also extracted for 16S rRNA sequencing to profile microbial communities. Soil N additions significantly increased CO2 flux and soil C turnover (seasonal CO2 flux per unit soil C) in 5% and 10% C fields, but not in 20% or 25% C fields. Soil C content was closely related to soil N:P stoichiometry, with N:P ratios of ca. 12, 16, 24, and 56 respectively in the 5, 10, 20 and 25% C fields. Seasonal CO2 fluxes (per m2) were highest in 10% C soils. However, soil C turnover was inversely related to soil C concentrations, with the greatest C turnover at the lowest values of soil C. Soil C turnover showed stronger relationships with soil chemical parameters than seasonal CO2 fluxes alone, and the best predictors of soil C turnover were soil total and extractable N:P ratios, along with extractable P alone. Our results show that soil P availability and stoichiometry influence the turnover of soil C, even where primary producers are clearly limited by N. Prior work has suggested these contrasting patterns in nutrient limitation may arise due to stoichiometric differences among plants and soil microbes. We hypothesize that differences in soil carbon turnover may in part reflect shifts in metabolism of microbial communities associated with stoichiometric variation in soils.",

            "abstract": "Emergent constraints are observable quantities that provide some physical basis for testing or predicting how a climate model will respond to greenhouse gas forcing. Very few such constraints have been identified for the multi-model CMIP archive. Here we explore the question of whether constraints that apply to a single model, a perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE) of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM3.1), can be applied to predicting the climate sensitivities of models within the CMIP archive. In particular we construct our predictive patterns from multivariate EOFs of the CAM3.1 ensemble control climate. Multiple regressive statistical models were created that do an excellent job of predicting CAM3.1 sensitivity to greenhouse gas forcing. However, these same patterns fail spectacularly to predict sensitivities of models within the CMIP archive. We attribute this failure to several factors. First, and perhaps the most important, is that the structures affecting climate sensitivity in CAM3.1 have a unique signature in the space of our multivariate EOF patterns that are unlike any other climate model. That is to say, we should not expect CAM3.1 to represent the way another models within CMIP archive respond to greenhouse gas forcing. The second, perhaps related, reason is that the CAM3.1 PPE does a poor job of spanning the range of climates and responses found within the CMIP archive. We shall discuss the implications of these results for the prospect of finding emergent constraints within the CMIP archive. We will also discuss what this may mean for establishing uncertainties in climate projections.",

            "abstract": "The original calibration function of the RH sensor on the Phoenix Thermal and Electrical Conductivity Sensor (TECP) has been revised in order to extend the range of the valid calibration, and to improve accuracy. The original function returned non-physical RH values at the lowest temperatures. To resolve this, and because the original calibration was performed against a pair of hygrometers that measured frost point (Tf), the revised calibration equation is also cast in terms of frost point. Because of the complexity of maintaining very low temperatures and high RH in the laboratory, no calibration data exists at T < 203K. However, sensor response duringf the mission was smooth and continuous down to 181 K. Therefore we have opted to include flight data in the calibration data set; selection was limited to data acquired during periods when the atmosphere is known to have been saturated.\nTf remained below 210 K throughout the mission(P < 0.75 Pa). RH, conversely, ranged from 1 to well under 0.01 diurnally, due to ~50 K temperature variations. To first order, both vapor pressure and its variance are greater during daylight hours. Variance in overnight humidity is almost entirely explained by temperature, while atmospheric turbulence contributes substantial variance to daytime humidity. Likewise, data gathered with the TECP aloft reflect higher H2O abundances than at the surface, as well as greater variance. There is evidence for saturation of the atmosphere overnight throughout much of the mission. In virtually every overnight observation, once the atmosphere cooled to Tf, water vapor begins to decrease, and tracks air temperature. There is no evidence for substantial decreases in water vapor prior to saturation, as expected for adsorptive exchange. Likewise, there is no evidence of local control of vapor by phases such as perchlorate hydrates hydrated minerals.\nThe daytime average H2O pressure does not change substantially over the course of the mission, although the H2O column abundance varies by a factor of 2. Column abundances calculated from TECP data are lower than orbital measurements if one assumes that H2O is uniformly mixed through a single scale height. These results argue that the vertical distribution of H2O begins to change well in advance of surface concentrations as northern autumn approaches.",

Here we present the experience developed in this endeavor as part of our Partnerships for Enhanced Engagement in Research (PEER) project sponsored by USAID/NSF/NAS. The project introduced educational and outreach activities that included core curriculum course development for university students from all majors, community-based learning projects, citizen science and outreach programs to school students and community members. Through these activities, students worked with the project scientists on a variety of activities that ranged from citizen science and undergraduate research to run mass experiments that measure the quality of air, drinking water, and ultraviolet level in greater Cairo, Egypt, to community awareness campaigns through the production of short documentaries and communicating them with stakeholders and target groups, including schools and TV stations. The activities enhanced students learning and the public awareness on climate change and the underlying role of human activities. It also connected effectively the project scientists with college and university students a well as the wider segments of the society, which resulted in a host of benefits including better scientific literacy and appreciation to the role of scientists, promoting scientists as role models, sharing the values of science, and motivating future generations to puruse a career in science\nNote: This presentation is a PEER project sponsored by USAID/NSF/NAS\nProject Link (at National Academies website):\nhttp://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/dsc/peerscience/PGA_084046.htm\nwebsite: http://CleanAirEgypt.org\nLinks to cited work:\nCore Curriculum Course:\nhttp://bit.ly/FutureLife\nCitizen Science Project: Quality of Air, Drinking Water, and U.V.

            "abstract": "While developed countries have implemented engineering techniques and sanitation technologies to keep water resources clean from runoff and ground contamination, air pollution and its contribution of harmful contaminants to our water resources has yet to be fully understood and managed. Due to the large spatial and temporal extent and subsequent computational intensity required to understand atmospheric deposition as a pollutant source, a geographic information system (GIS) was utilized. This project developed a multi-step workflow to better define the placement of in situ sensors on Lake Perris in Southern California. Utilizing a variety of technologies including ArcGIS 10.1 with 3D and Spatial Analyst extensions and WindNinja, the impact of terrain on wind speed and direction was simulated and the spatial distribution of contaminant deposition across Lake Perris was calculated as flux. Specifically, the flux of particulate matter (PM10) at the air – water interface of a lake surface was quantified by season for the year of 2009. Integrated Surface Hourly (ISH) wind speed and direction data and ground station air quality measurements from the California Air Resources Board were processed and integrated for use within ModelBuilder. Results indicate that surface areas nearest Alessandro Island and the dam of Lake Perris should be avoided when placing in situ sensors. Furthermore, the location of sensor placement is dependent on seasonal fluctuations of PM10 which can be modeled using the techniques used in this study.",

            "abstract": "For the northeastern United States, Winter 2013-14 was the coldest winter since the late 1970s and perhaps the coldest on record relative to prevailing climatic conditions. Frequent snowstorms and cold air outbreaks led to considerable press coverage and heated scholarly debate over the possible role of anthropogenic climate change in modulating wintertime variability in the northern hemisphere polar jet. While mechanisms have been proposed, to date, the observational record offers no definitive evidence for such a relationship, nor does it conclusively exclude one. To further explore this question, we employ a large, initial conditions ensemble of the Community Earth System Model forced with historical and RCP8.5 emissions. The ensemble effectively samples internal variability in the climate system and is used to assess the potential for forced changes in polar jet variability and the frequency of cold air outbreaks over the northeastern U.S. with projected increases in global mean temperature during the 21st century.",

            "abstract": "Cyanobacteria-dominated microbial mats played a key role in the evolution of the early Earth and provide a model for exploring the relationships between ecology, evolution and biogeochemistry. A recently described nonheterocystous filamentous cyanobacterium, strain ESFC-1, has been shown to be a major diazotroph year round in the intertidal microbial mat system at Elkhorn Slough, CA, USA. Based on phylogenetic analyses of the 16s RNA gene, ESFC-1 appears to belong to a unique, genus-level divergence within the cyanobacteria. Consequently, the draft genome sequence of this strain has been determined. Here we report features of this genome, particularly as they relate to the ecological functions and capabilities of strain ESFC-1. One striking feature of this cyanobacterium is the apparent lack of a functional bi-directional hydrogenase typically expected to be found within a diazotroph; consortia- and culture-based experiments exploring the metabolic processes of ESFC-1 also indicate that this hydrogenase is absent. Co-culture studies with ESFC-1 and some of the dominant heterotrophic members within the microbial mat system, including the ubiquitous Flavobacterium Muricauda sp., which often is found associated with cyanobacteria in nature and in culture collections worldwide, have also been performed. We report on these species-species interactions, including materials exchange between the cyanobacterium and heterotrophic bacterium. The combination of genomics with culture- and consortia-based experimental research is a powerful tool for understanding microbial processes and interactions in complex ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "The OMPS Limb sensor flying on the NPP-Suomi mission measures vertically-resolved limb spectral radiance profiles to derive a high spatial resolution ozone profile. The sensor uses both UV and visible light dispersed by a prism and imaged onto a single CCD to make profile measurements of the Earth limb radiance. The measurement challenges include a wide dynamic range in both spectral and spatial directions and demanding stray light requirements, especially for the UV wavelengths.\nOn NPP, the sensor uses two optical gains (bright and dim limb spectral images) and two integration times (Long and Short) to handle the dynamic range of the limb signal. The sensor also contains precisely-positioned spectral filters at the focal plane to control stray light. The multiple image approach creates noise in retrieved profiles at the bright-dim crossover points. The filters are challenging both in fabrication and in alignment.\nThe proposed operational change for the JPSS2 OMPS Limb sensor eliminates the multiple image approach and reduces stray light levels through use of different images for different wavelength channels. Through use of a stepped integration time scheme and on-board image consolidation, the spectral radiance measurements are improved and more pixels are available for downlink within the allotted data rate. We present the operational concept, results of ground testing using the Limb sensor engineering unit and estimates of expected on-orbit performance.",

            "abstract": "It is well-established that a major pathway for secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation is via the partitioning of semi-volatile products of gas-phase photochemical reactions into preexisting organic particulate matter. Semi-volatile partitioning theory is widely used while modeling SOA. Despite its significance, parameterizations based solely on this formation pathway are unable to reproduce trends in SOA mass, particularly high atmospheric O/C ratios and enrichment of organic aerosol aloft. Recent studies have also highlighted the importance of formation of SOA through reactions of water-soluble organic gases (WSOG) in atmospheric waters (clouds, fogs, and wet aerosols).\nIn order to understand the relative magnitude of potential precursors to SOA via both formation pathways, we modeled semi-volatile and WSOG concentrations during the Secondary Organic and Aerosol Study (SOAS) conducted in Brent, Alabama during June-July 2013. CMAQ 5.0.1 is used to predict mixing ratios of semi-volatile gases and WSOG over the continental US for a 10 day time period during SOAS. Our modeling results indicate that WSOG concentrations are an order of magnitude greater, on average, than the sum of semi-volatile gases. Interestingly, concentrations of semi-volatile gases increase aloft, unlike concentrations of WSOG. These results suggest that the potential for SOA formation from WSOG was high, and provide support for efforts to accurately model that multiphase chemistry in order to develop more effective air quality management strategies.",

The full constellation will be constructed by two deployments of identical 1.5U CubeSats into LEO. The first launch will deploy eight satellites into a polar sun-synchronous orbit from the Island of Kauai in the Hawaiian Islands to form the NASA/Ames Research Center \"Edison Demonstration of Smallsat Networks\" (EDSN) swarm of satellites. The on-board Energetic Particle Integrating Space Environment Monitor (EPISEM) instrument built by the Space Science and Engineering Laboratory at Montana State University consists of a cylindrical 12 cm*2-ster omnidirectional Geiger counter sensitive to electrons above about 500 keV. The eight EDSN satellites are expected to deploy in late November 2014 into an 410 x 485 km orbit at ~92 degrees inclination forming two slowly-separating groups of four measurement platforms each to set up the initial 8-satellite swarm. Separately, two additional copies of the EDSN satellites will deploy from the International Space Station as elements of the NODES mission into a 52 degree inclination orbit at about 375 km altitude. Together the 10 satellites will characterize the distribution of low altitude penetrating electrons over spatial scales from 10’s to thousands of km. The paper will describe the mission concept, the implementation of the spacecraft, and the unusual operations concept that allows stored science data to be collected from all eight satellites of the EDSN swarm through an intersatellite communications link and transferred to the ground by a single member of the swarm. The EDSN satellites operate completely autonomously without ground uplink. The paper will also include early scientific results if available by mid-December, 2014.",

The study focused on Crow Creek watershed, which is one of the main watersheds providing water to the city of Cheyenne, Wyoming. Pronounced water shortages were occurred between 2011 and 2013, leaving no water in the streams by the end of July each year. We developed climate scenarios by downscaling the predictions from General Circulation Models (GCM’s) and Regional Climate Models (RCM’s). Therefore, WRF was employed downscale the existing GCM’s and RCM’s in to local climate conditions and to obtain a higher spatial resolution. The data assimilation system and software architecture enables parallel processing developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The Automated Geospatial Water Assessment tool (AGWA) interface was used to parameterize and execute two hydrologic models: the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the KINEmatic Runoff and EROSion model (KINEROS2). We used freely available data including SSURGO soils, Multi-Resolution Landscape Consortium (MRLC) land cover, and 10m resolution terrain data to derive suitable initial parameters for the models. Observed daily rainfall and temperature inputs as a function of elevation were used for model validation. Cellular Automation used in predicting future land cover. Future scenarios were developed for different global emissions scenarios proposed by the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). Daily rainfall and surface temperature series were simulated for Crow Creek watershed for the year 2050 and used as an input to AGWA model. Results were used to find the impacts of the climate on water resources and the flow regimes of the watershed. The results from different data sources were compared for percentage of explained variance, mean bias for temperature and rainfall to produce spatially explicit maps. Most of the GCM’s and RCM’s underpredict the stream flow in the area and in different scenarios. Nash-Sutcliffe for the coefficient of efficiency (CE) was best with the simulations performed with station data and above 0.8 or higher.",

The geophysical tests carried out included Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), magnetic gradiometer, and Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) to help assess geotechnical conditions such as buried cavities and hallways, thickness and elastic properties of sand sediments, and the depth to the underlying granitic bedrock. The tests were performed to help with the investigation of structural damage observed along a massive adobe wall (north façade) which has shown signs of distress including fissures, settlements, and other damage.

            "abstract": "Two different experimental and computational methods implemented to investigate the flow through porous media. The porous media flow is a highly demanding field in industry and academia that has not been largely studied due to its complexities based on multi-phase geometry and ability to resolve scales over a reasonably large domain. In the proposed study, two-component particle image velocimetry which collects the velocity field vectors under accurate consideration of refractive index matching is compared statistically and visually with the modeled velocity field emanated from direct numerical simulation to evaluate both methods for consistency. The characteristics of the porous media used in this experiment is controlled by a randomly packed bed using uniformly sized spherical particles. There are many challenges that made this work interesting to be considered as an accurate comparison between computation and experimentation that includes refractive index matching errors, magnification uncertainties, and the uncertainties in identifying of the proper geometry of the beads as well as, the arduousness, of matching the geometry, grid resolution particularly near solid contact points, and proper boundary conditions in DNS. Detailed analogy of different resolutions in numerical simulation with PIV measurements are visualized by attention paid to the statistical distribution of velocities, and the deviations of DNS estimations from the measured values. There is accurate and reasonable matching the velocity fields except for some regions of constricted flow. The axial velocity results are within 6-7 percent (for different DNS resolutions) and the normal velocity within 4-6 %. Streamline details show that both methods are within the good range of agreement. This study is a comprehensive study of matching experiment with numerical results in a very low Reynolds number range for porous media flows.",

Additionally, to understand the impact of sulfate reduction on biohydrogen consumption, molybdate was added to a parallel experiment in the same run. 4 metagenome and 12 metatranscriptome Illumina HiSeq lanes were completed over day / night, and control / molybdate experiments.\nPreliminary comparative examination of noon and midnight metatranscriptomic samples mapped using bowtie2 to reference genomes has revealed several notable results about the dominant mat-building cyanobacterium Microcoleus chthonoplastes PCC 7420.\nDominant cyanobacterium M. chthonoplastes PCC 7420 shows expression in several pathways for nitrogen scavenging, including nitrogen fixation.\nReads mapped to M. chthonoplastes PCC 7420 shows expression of two starch storage and utilization pathways, one as a starch-trehalose-maltose-glucose pathway, another through UDP-glucose-cellulose-β-1,4 glucan-glucose pathway. \nThe overall trend of gene expression was primarily light driven up-regulation followed by down-regulation in dark, while much of the remaining expression profile appears to be constitutive.\nCo-assembly of quality-controlled reads from 4 metagenomes was performed using Ray Meta with progressively smaller K-mer sizes, with bins identified and filtered using principal component analysis of coverages from all libraries and a %GC filter, followed by reassembly of the remaining co-assembly reads and binned reads. Despite having relatively similar abundance profiles in each metagenome, this binning approach was able to distinctly resolve bins from dominant taxa, but also sulfate reducing bacteria that are desired for understanding molybdate inhibition. Bins generated from this iterative assembly process will be used for downstream mapping of transcriptomic reads as well as isolation efforts for Cyanobacteria-associated bacteria. ",

The Earth Observatory Group was founded to communicate these stories to the public. We will present how we have used the capabilities of all the Terra instruments over the past 15 years to expand the public’s knowledge of NASA Earth science. The ever-increasing quantity and quality of Terra data, combined with technological improvements to data availability and services has allowed the Earth Observatory and, as a result, the greater science-aware media, to greatly expand the visibility of NASA data and imagery. We will offer thoughts on best practices in using these multi-faceted instruments for public communication and we will share how we have worked with Terra science teams and affiliated systems to see the potential stories in their data and the value of providing the data in a timely fashion.

            "abstract": "Adding a groundwater component to land surface models affects modeled precipitation because the additional water supply from the subsurface contributes to increased water vapor in the atmosphere, resulting in modifications of atmospheric convection. This study focused on how groundwater dynamics affect atmospheric convection in the Amazon River Basin (ARB) during July, typically the driest month. Coupled groundwater-land-atmosphere model simulations show that groundwater storage increases evapotranspiration rates (latent heat fluxes) and lowers surface temperatures, which increases the surface pressure gradient and thus, anomalous surface divergence. Therefore, the convection over the Southern Hemispheric ARB during the dry season becomes weaker when groundwater dynamics are included in the model. In addition, the changes in atmospheric vertical water vapor advection are associated with decreases in precipitation resulting from downward transport anomalies. The results of this study highlight the importance of subsurface hydrological processes in the Amazon climate system, which have implications for precipitation changes during the dry season observed in most current climate models.",

Cross organization collaboration is often impeded due to infrastructure security constraints, rigid financial controls, bureaucracy, and workforce nationalities, etc., which can force groups to work in a segmented fashion and/or through awkward and suboptimal web services. We show how a focused community may come together, share modeling and analysis codes, computing configurations, scientific results, knowledge and expertise on a public cloud platform; diverse groups of researchers working together at “arms length”.\nThrough the OpenNEX experimental workshop, users can view short technical “how-to” videos and explore encapsulated working environment. Workshop participants can easily instantiate Amazon Machine Images (AMI) or launch full cluster and data processing configurations within minutes. Enabling users to instantiate computing environments from configuration templates on large public cloud infrastructures, such as Amazon Web Services, may provide a mechanism for groups to easily use each others work and collaborate indirectly. Moreover, using the public cloud for this workshop allowed a single group to host a large read only data archive, making datasets of interest to the community widely available on the public cloud, enabling other groups to directly connect to the data and reduce the costs of the collaborative work by freeing other individual groups from redundantly retrieving, integrating or financing the storage of the datasets of interest.",

We investigate the effect of bounce resonance between a fast magnetosonic wave and equatorially mirroring electrons using test particle simulation. Bounce resonance occurs when wave frequency matches multiple of electron bounce frequency. We find that the bounce resonance can lead to nonlinear oscillation of equatorially trapped electrons when wave frequency is near first few harmonics of electron bounce frequency. When in bounce resonance, the oscillation amplitude increases for larger wave amplitude, smaller wave normal angle, or larger plasma density. This oscillation is important for dynamics of equatorially mirroring electrons above 100 keV, because it can produce finite vz, which could enable gyro-resonance interaction with other waves such as whistler mode waves.",

            "abstract": "A relatively new topic of environmental hazards research revolves around vulnerability to disasters. These studies focused separately on biophysical and social vulnerability perspectives. Only recently, community-based vulnerability studies have become common because of the recognition that combining social and biophysical components is important and practical (Cutter, et al., 2000; Cutter, et al., 2003; Turner, et al., 2003). Researchers have modeled vulnerability to analyze its spatial variation (Montz, Cross, and Cutter, 2006). This study aimed at developing a technical framework for community-based vulnerability to the specific hazards of floods. Developing a technical framework in this research used a “vulnerability of place” method (Hebb & Mortsch, 2007). The data reduction technique used was Principal Components Analysis (PCA) which allows for each variable to explain part of the vulnerability. The case study was on flooding in the Tennessee River Basin. The initial run with all 46 variables produced 13 components that explained 69.77% of the variance. Because of the relative homogeneity across the county (i.e., land use and soil types most vulnerable to flooding being located away from heavily populated areas) biophysical variables became less important in this region in creating overall risk scores. This is made all the more obvious by the number of social variables (17) compared to the number of biophysical variables (8) in the final components. The lowest risk block groups are located within the cities: central Florence, central, and central Madison. The highest risk block groups are in rural areas covered predominately with pasture and agricultural land or forests. They also lie near or within the 100 year floodplain.",

However, how and why ENSO has changed in the past and how it may change in the future in association with changes in the mean state of the climate system are poorly understood. We propose that the response of ENSO to a freshwater perturbation in the North Atlantic that weakens the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is highly sensitive to the tropical Pacific mean state biases present in Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (GCMs) and that the presence or absence of tropical Pacific mean state biases can lead to a range of ENSO responses. We demonstrate these principles using a linearized coupled atmosphere-ocean model of the tropical Pacific in addition to fully coupled GCM simulations with the Community Earth System Model (CESM) in which freshwater perturbations were imposed to the North Atlantic. CESM runs were performed with and without the addition of heat flux corrections to reduce mean state biases in the tropics before the freshwater forcing was imposed. The processes responsible for the changes in ENSO variability due to the freshwater perturbation (with and without biases in the starting mean state) are quantified using an offline intermediate model of the tropical Pacific. Understanding the sensitivity of ENSO to such mean state changes and to biases in the mean state of the tropical Pacific in GCMs is critical for constraining past and future ENSO variability.",

Various receiver function analyses are routinely applied to map discontinuities in the Earth’s crust and mantle primarily in a station-by-station fashion. Deep active-source seismic soundings are done along some profiles. These passive and active seismic results provide useful constraints and verifications for 3D or 2D inversions of more easily available potential-field data though.\nWe advance new high-accuracy 3D and 2D methods for constrained nonlinear density interface inversions. Synthetic numerical model tests show that: the new nonlinear methods are stable and noise-resistant; comparing to the exact, the inversion results derived from the new methods are more accurate than those of the popular conventional methods. In this region there are several notable Moho interface depth gradient belts, which correspond to deep faults.

            "abstract": "Surface wind dynamics, while of great theoretical and practical interest, are still poorly understood due to the amazing complexity of the process. In particular surface-wind dynamics break several symmetries (isotropy and homogeneity) that are mathematically convenient when studying turbulence thus further complicating the situation. Studying these phenomena requires large amounts of data. And, although many interesting developments in measuring devices have happened, there is always the need for more observations and visual representations.\nArt pieces, such as Charles Sower’s WindSwept installation outside of the Randall Museum in San Francisco may radically help to change this situation. The installation was developed to help a large part of the public understand the complexity of the environment near the surface of the Earth. Its 612 light wind direction indicators reveal intermittent bursts of the wind while displaying also strong coherent structures that are characteristic of intermittent processes. Simulations of continuous in-scale universal multifractal velocity fields reveal identical characteristics to the WindSwept installation; velocity fields that until recently were thought could only be generated with brute force numerical methods of either the Navier-Stokes equations or approximations thereof.\nWith the advent of big data and their now more accessible visualisations (by artists akin to Charles Sower’s) hundreds of previously believed unthinkably complex processes are now seen to exhibit the same coherent patterns and intermittent yet repeating behaviour. Although these kinds of artwork are visually pleasing and important for public communication their link to stochastic processes has real application.\nWith fractals and multifractals we are able to connect these visually complex phenomena with meaningful mathematical models: models that allow us to not only reproduce these wonderful phenomena but give insight into the processes behind them which in turn allows for their prediction, forecasting and most importantly their understanding.",

            "abstract": "An archive of 70 good-to-excellent quality Landsat TM and ETM+ images acquired between 1984 and 2011 were identified through visual examination of the GLOVIS web portal. After careful consideration of factors relevant to agriculture in the region (e.g., crop calendar) and associated image processing needs (e.g., preference for anniversary dates), the images deemed most appropriate were downloaded. Standard preprocessing, including visual quality and statistical inspection, sub-setting to the study area, was performed, and the results combined in a database with available GIS data. The resolution merge spatial enhancement technique was applied to any ETM+ imagery to improve visual clarity and interpretability. The NDVI was calculated for all images in the time series. Unsupervised classification of images was performed for dates ranging from 1987 just before the inception of the Rebea project in 1989 through 2011. In order to reduce uncertainty related to lack of detailed ancillary and/or ground reference data, simple land cover classes were mapped, specifically: surface water, agriculture, and other. Results were able to quantify and track areas of each class over time, and showed a marked decrease in agriculture between the Iraq invasion in 2003 to the end of the study period in 2011, despite massive efforts and capital by the United States and Iraqi governments to improve agriculture in the area. Complications to understanding the role of warfare and conflict on the environment in the Mosul region include severe drought and water shortages, including effects of the Turkish GAP water resource development project in the headwaters of the Tigris-Euphrates, as well as Mosul Dam structural problems associated with geologically-unsuitable conditions upon which the dam is constructed. Now, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) likely captured the Mosul Dam on the day this abstract was submitted. Our Landsat-based monitoring and analysis of the Rebea Project and Mosul Dam continues, including the acquisition of Landsat 8 imagery for 31 July 2014, just prior to the ISIS attack. Details of our completed and ongoing research will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Paddy fields in monsoon Asia have a great important role in the global budget of GHGs. Recently long-term fluxes are continuously observed at cropland ecosystems in Asia. In this study, the exchanges of CO2 at a number of paddy fields were estimated by a satellite-based empirical model with the Terra/MODIS data, and the results were compared with the ground-based observation data.\nGross primary productivity (GPP) is estimated from normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Ecosystem respiration (RE) is also estimated from NDVI and land surface temperature. And, net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) was calculated the difference between GPP and RE. Some parameters used in the model were determined by the ground data measured at HCH, the single-rice site in western Japan (34N32,133E56).\nCO2 exchanges at four sites -- HCH, MSE, SGA, and IRRI -- were estimated. PAR and air temperature as input data were also tested by ground data at each sites. Seasonal variations of Gpp, Re, and NEE during cultivated period at four sites were compared. The model reasonably reproduced the seasonal variation of CO2 exchange at three sites in Japan. However, Gpp by the model was overestimated in early stage of the first cropping and through the second cropping at the Phillipine site, IRRI. Cumulative NEE by the model showed the difference by from -6.8 to 10.1 % compared with the observed NEE.",

            "abstract": "The debate over decreasing or increasing ecosystem productivity in response to drought has been lasting for a long time period. However, it remains uncertain yet why ecosystem productivity differently responds to precipitation decrease, and how drought would shape future ecosystem functions at a regional scale. The sensitivity of biomes to droughts is of great significance in determining the ecosystem structure and function, and influencing the carbon exchanges between land and atmosphere, which may in turn affect future climate change. Understanding the contrasting responses of productivity among regions and the underlying mechanism is critical for improving our knowledge of the drought resilience and tolerance of plants and accurately projecting drought consequences and developing appropriate adaption and mitigating strategies in the context of rapid global warming. By using an integrated approach combining in-situ measurements, remote-sensing, empirical upscaling products and process-based model simulation, here we investigated the response of ecosystem Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) to droughts at annual scale across the conterminous United States (CONUS). The results indicate that annual GPP is more responsive to the year-to-year variations of precipitation in the western US (arid sites/regions) than that in the eastern US (humid sites/regions), as a consequence of the stronger inter-annual variations in soil water content and physiological and structural drought-adaptive strategies of xeric biomes. Insensitivity of annual GPP in the mesic biomes implies different drought-adaptive strategies by keeping a high level of non-structural carbohydrate. Our simulation further suggests that over the 21st century, the more pervasive global-change-type droughts (drought is projected to occur under warmer temperature condition as climate change proceeds) are likely to reduce vegetation productivity, change the current pattern of biome structure and composition, and induce higher tree mortality in the southeastern US.",

            "abstract": "Heterogeneity of soil hydraulic properties directly affects variations of hydrological processes at corresponding scales. Understanding spatial variation of soil hydraulic properties such as soil moisture is therefore fundamental for modeling watershed ecohydrological processes. As part of the National Science Foundation of China (NSFC) funded ''Integrated Ecohydrological Research Plan of the Heihe River Watershed'', this study established an observation network that consists of sampling points, zones, and tributaries to analyze spatial variations of soil hydraulic properties in the Upper Reach of the Heihe River Watershed, a second largest inland river (terminal lake) with a drainage area of over 128,000 km2 in Northwest China. Spatial heterogeneity of soil properties was analyzed based on the large number of soil sampling and in situ observations. The spatial clustering method, Full-Order-CLK was employed to derive five soil heterogeneous zones (Configuration 97, 80, 65, 40, and 20). Subsequently, SWAT model was used to quantify the impact of the spatial heterogeneity of soil hydraulic properties on hydrologic process in the study watershed. Results show the simulations by the SWAT model with the spatially clustered soil hydraulic information from the field sampling data had much better representation of the soil heterogeneity and more accurate performance than the model using the average soil property values for each soil type derived from the coarse soil datasets (Gansu Soil Handbook at 1:1,000,000 scale). Thus, incorporating detailed field sampling soil heterogeneity data greatly improves performance in hydrologic modeling.",

Numerous landslides and debris flows often occurred in mountainous watershed during typhoon event, resulting in casualties and properties/infrastructures damage. Among the historical disasters, there were a several typhoon events harmed Chenyulan watershed in Nantou County, central Taiwan, particularly Typhoon Herb in 1996 and Typhoon Morakot in 2009 which brought catastrophic destruction. The typhoons caused extreme rainfall and triggered more than 30 large debris flows that buried many houses and deaths.\nThis study selected the SPOT satellite images after those typhoon events to explore the hazard maps. The satellite images interpretation could extract the emergent landslides of each typhoon event. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Spatial Dispersion Index (SDI) were used to categorize collapse and deposition area of the landslides. Then, the total amount of collapse volume could estimate from slope-depth area calculation.\nThe result found that the landslide sites with higher NDVI and lower SPI could be implied the headstream collapse or deep-seated landslide, whereas the landslide sites with lower NDVI and lower SPI could be implied the deposition or debris. In summarize, this study performed effective results for rapid collapse/deposition extraction from the landslide disaster. To ensure the safety from the post-disaster, it could be suggested for the related authorities because the collapse/deposition area should be instantly enclosed and classified as the conservation lands which require difference intensive conservation practices.\nKeywords: Hazard map, Debris flow, Slope, Normalized difference vegetation index, Spatial dispersion index",

            "abstract": "With more than 5 years in lunar orbit, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Diviner Lunar Radiometer is acquiring a thermal infrared dataset of unprecedented coverage and detail. The LRO spacecraft's orbit is fixed in inertial space, which has allowed Diviner to acquire multispectral thermal emission measurements covering 24 hours in local time over the entire globe at a spatial resolution of less than 1 km. The original measurement goals of the Diviner experiment were to: 1. Characterize the Moon's surface thermal environments; 2. Map the properties of the lunar surface; and 3. Characterize polar cold traps. During the LRO extended mission, Diviner has made detailed maps of the bulk thermal properties of the lunar surface, including the distribution of exposed rocks, surface roughness, and the thickness of the low-density surface layer. In addition, Diviner’s thermal emission measurements near 8 microns wavelength have enabled mapping of the Moon's silicate composition. Diviner's high latitude measurements have defined the locations of cold traps for polar volatiles, and are being analyzed to provide new constraints on lunar heat flow. Comparisons between Diviner data and other lunar datasets are providing key insights in to the moon's composition, geological history, and the distribution of volatiles. As a result of Diviner's comprehensive infrared dataset , the moon is the most completely mapped body in the solar system, and much of what has been learned can be applied to studying other airless bodies.",

            "abstract": "Models for the growth of the Tibetan plateau have been a subject of great debate for decades. Here we add to the debate with new insights from an advanced imaging of the lithosphere structure of the western China. To resolve the ambiguity of model parameters and to improve resolution in seismic imaging, a combination of different data sets that have sensitivities to different parameters is required. We’ve recently developed joint-inversion methods involving Pn travel times, receiver functions, and surface wave dispersion measurements and applied them systematically to seismic stations in western China to obtain improved 3D P and S lithosphere models. Our models show significantly higher Vp/Vs ratios in northern Himalaya Block and southern Qiangtang Block than in the Lhasa Block. Mid-crustal low velocity zone (LVZ) is observed under much of the Tibetan Plateau. However, it is much more pronounced under the outer regions of the plateau (the Himalaya and Qiangtang Blocks) than under its interior (the Lhasa Block). The location of pronounced mid-crustal LVZ correlates (anti-correlates) with the distribution of seismicity in the plateau; the low seismicity areas have more pronounced LVZs and greater Vp/Vs values and the high seismic areas have less pronounced LVZs and smaller Vp/Vs values. The observations support the existence of a proto-Tibetan Plateau core and the outward growth of the margins at a later stage after the India-Eurasian collision (Wang C.S. et al., PNAS, 2008). The proto-plateau is more rigid and can sustain stress to cause brittle failure of earthquakes while the materials at the margins are weaker and can be subject to plastic deformation with much less seismicity. In this model, the proto-plateau core acts as an efficient medium for the stress transfer from the collision front to the margins for the outward growth of the plateau. The crust and mantle lithosphere act as a coherent unit as indicated by the consistent pattern of seismic anomalies with depth. We speculate that such a stress-transfer mechanism from strong lithosphere blocks (e.g., major basins surrounding the plateau such as Tarim, Qaidam, and Sichuan) may have played a strong role in generating the deformation and seismicity in Asia.",

            "abstract": "Regional and global climate model simulated streamflows for high-latitude regions show systematic biases, particularly in the timing and magnitude of spring peak flows. Though these biases could be related to the snow water equivalent and spring temperature biases in models, a good part of these biases is due to the unaccounted effects of non-uniform infiltration capacity of the frozen ground and other related processes. In this paper, the frozen scheme in the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS), which is used in the Canadian regional and global climate models, is modified to include fractional permeable area, supercooled liquid water and a new formulation for hydraulic conductivity. Interflow is also included in these experiments presented in this study to better explain the steamflows after snow melt season. The impact of these modifications on the regional hydrology, particularly streamflow, is assessed by comparing three simulations, performed with the original and two modified versions of CLASS, driven by atmospheric forcing data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis data (ERA-Interim), for the 1990–2001 period, over a northeast Canadian domain. The two modified versions of CLASS differ in the soil hydraulic conductivity and matric potential formulations, with one version being based on formulations from a previous study and the other one is newly proposed. Results suggest statistically significant decreases in infiltration for the simulation with the new hydraulic conductivity and matric potential formulations and fractional permeable area concept, compared to the original version of CLASS, which is also reflected in the increased spring surface runoff and streamflows in this simulation with modified CLASS, over most of the study domain. The simulated spring peaks and their timing in this simulation is also in better agreement to those observed.",

The water quality of Blackbird Creek has been constantly monitored for 3 years and correlated with the rain and storm events. Soil nutrients composition has been studied by extracting the water associated with soil aggregates and analyzing the levels of different nutrients. Soil quality is also assessed for heavy metals to identify potential human impact that may affect the health of ecosystem. Within the Blackbird Creek there is a threat to native plant communities from invasive plant species as they alter the ecosystem dynamics. Saltmarsh cord grass (Spartina alterniflora) and common reed (Phragmites australius) are the common wetland plants. Aerial mapping of the creek has been conducted to determine the area covered by invasive plant species. The microbial community structure plays a key role in soil carbon and nitrogen cycles in the ecosystem. Molecular analysis has been performed to study the microbial diversity with respect to the type of marsh grasses. This program has also incorporated the use of diatoms as biological indicators to assess the health of ecosystem and correlate that data with physical and chemical water quality data. The abundance and diversity of macro fauna such as blue crabs, fish and other significant species has also been studied. Stable isotopic analysis of these macro fauna has also been performed to study the food web. The results from this program will be helpful in addressing environmental challenges and designing management strategies.",

            "abstract": "Tuning a atmospheric general circulation model involves a daunting task of adjusting non-observable parameters to adjust the mean climate. These parameters arise from necessity to describe unresolved flow through parametrizations. Tuning a climate model is often done with certain set of priorities, such as global mean temperature, net top of the atmosphere radiation. These priorities are hard enough to reach let alone reducing systematic biases in the models. The goal of currently study is to explore alternate ways to tune a climate model to reduce some systematic biases that can be used in synergy with existing efforts. Nudging a climate model to a known state is a poor man's inverse of tuning process described above. Our approach involves nudging the atmospheric model to state of art reanalysis fields thereby providing a balanced state with respect to the global mean temperature and winds. The tendencies derived from nudging are negative of errors from physical parametrizations as the errors from dynamical core would be small. Patterns of nudging are compared to the patterns of different physical parametrizations to decipher the cause for certain biases in relation to tuning parameters. This approach might also help in understanding certain compensating errors that arise from tuning process. ECHAM6 is a comprehensive general model, also used in recent Coupled Model Intercomparision Project(CMIP5). The approach used to tune it and effect of certain parameters that effect its mean climate are reported clearly, hence it serves as a benchmark for our approach. Our planned experiments include nudging ECHAM6 atmospheric model to European Center Reanalysis (ERA-Interim) and reanalysis from National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and decipher choice of certain parameters that lead to systematic biases in its simulations. Of particular interest are reducing long standing biases related to simulation of Asian summer monsoon.",

            "abstract": "Past ocean conditions are primarily discerned from geochemical and community-based analyses of fossilized taxa, each of which have unique environmental niches and dynamics. A key requirement of such paleoceanographic studies is that some unbiased or well-constrained record of the living ecosystem and climate is deposited on the sea floor and preserved through the post-depositional processes that act to distort them.\n It is widely known that foraminiferal species exhibit varying seasonal preferences and that seasonality is a key variable to account for in paleoceanographic reconstructions. However, on longer time scales (> year), it is generally assumed that species record the ‘average’ environmental conditions or typical variance (e.g., El Nino intensity) that existed in a given, time-averaged sediment sample.\nHere I examine planktonic foraminiferal population dynamics on yearly and longer time scales, in order to quantify their effect on paleoceanographic reconstructions. Using a previously published record of >250 years of population dynamics in the Santa Barbara Basin sediments, I find that the majority of individuals in a given species lived during a small subset of the total years (~15- 37% of years depending on the species). Populations of shallow, mixed layer species primarily represent the warmest, youngest years, while thermocline species primarily represent the cooler, older years. Importantly, the seasonality of species does not always predict their interannual dynamics. The general importance of long time-scale population dynamics on paleoceanographic reconstructions will also be considered in a theoretical model parameterized with temporally explicit species co-variances and temperature variability. Such modeling is needed to constrain the relative impact that a very good year can have on our interpretation of the 'average' of hundreds to thousands of years.",

            "abstract": "The Philippines is geographically prone to tropical cyclones with an annual average of 20 typhoons entering the country’s area of responsibility. On 08 November 2013, a Category 5 Typhoon Haiyan with maximum one-minute sustained wind speed of 315 kph, hit the central area of the archipelago. The damage from the typhoon reached two billion US dollars with 6,300 reported casualties. The adverse impacts of possible future storm surge events in the Philippine archipelago specifically in the Visayan region can only be mitigated if a storm surge model that will include the inundation of the coastal areas is generated. The hydrodynamic modeling software, Delft3D, was used in the storm surge simulation of the Visayas Islands. An overall model of the Visayas with a coarse grid cell size was nested to a detailed model on hardly stricken populated areas with a 10-m per pixel resolution Digital Elevation Model and General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans bathymetry. Due to lack of observed water level data during the onslaught of Typhoon Haiyan, the overall Visayas model was calibrated by simulating previous typhoons with recorded data acquired from tide stations. Several simulations were carried out to generate farthest possible inland incursion of storm surges. This was done by translating the actual typhoon track vertically and horizontally with a specified increment. The output of the study is a storm surge inundation map that can be used to determine safe zones for development of infrastructure near coastal areas. The storm surge inundation map can also be used as basis for disaster preparedness plans of coastal communities threatened by approaching typhoons.",

            "abstract": "Significant differences exist between the sedimentology of fluvial and tidal channels. This is primarily the result of differences in the temporal and spatial patterns of the hydrodynamics, and, where the regimes overlap, complex interactions between the two. In this detailed study, we investigate flow and resulting sedimentation in six tidal meander bends with varying levels of fluvial influence. Tidal currents were recorded using a combination of continuous deployments and vessel-based synoptic measurements. Residual circulation patterns and estimates of tidal asymmetry were determined. A series of cores, taken along transects both parallel and perpendicular to the channel, were used to examine the spatial variation of mud and sand deposits.\nWe observed a separation of flow into ebb and flood pathways, creating a residual circulation and encouraging the growth of point bars. At our study sites, the majority of the channels were found to be ebb dominant. At several tidal sites, we identified regions of the channel where the flow remained close to zero throughout much of the tidal cycle. This occurred in sections of the channel that were primarily active during the flood tide. In these areas, settling of fine sediment was not limited to slack water periods as is common to most systems and, instead, could occur over longer periods. This translated to sandier sediments being observed in parts of the channel that were primarily active during the ebb tide, compared to muddier sediments where the channel only was active during flood tides.\nIn regions where there was a greater fluvial influence, flow reversal during flood tides was reduced, and the timing of slack water was altered. At the upstream limit of our observations, minimal flow reversal was observed during the tide and the current slowed to zero (slack) only once per tidal cycle (during the flood). Although water levels at this site indicated that the tidal wave was strongly flood dominated due to shallow water distortion effects (M2:M4 phase difference = 97 degrees), the superposition of fluvial flows led to the true transport being ebb dominated. In addition to differences in the levels of mud and sand deposition, the length of period during which settling of fine sediment occurs may impact vertical accumulation rates in the channel.",

With a population of about 16 million, and an annual average growth rate of 3.85%, a rapidly increasing number of vehicles (more than 7.4 million, with an annual average growth rate of 7.27%, as reported by the Economic Survey of Delhi, 2012–2013), Delhi is facing an aggressive rise in vehicular pollution. Ground-level traffic vehicles in Delhi are typically natural gas fueled, gasoline fueled or diesel-fueled. The traffic-related air pollutants [particulate matter (PM), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), lead (Pb), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)] have huge impact on the health of the population given high exposure risk for daily commuters.\nWe conducted on-roadway ambient monitoring on National Highway-2 (NH-2; Delhi–Mathura Road), on the southeast outer zone of Delhi represented by heterogeneous traffic during heavy traffic hours in the morning and early evening, with varying vehicle speeds ranging 35-60 km/h. Ambient levels of PM2.5, PM10, O3, NOx, CO, CO2, black carbon (BC), and certain VOCs (benzene, xylene, ethylbenze) were recorded. In addition, traffic volume count surveys were carried out to record the number of vehicles in different hours of the day, moving across the count point during a given time. Specific traffic volume counts were also conducted at the location to understand the flow of traffic. Vehicle counts classified the vechicles into separate categories: buses (9.1%), trucks (9.2%), cars (41.6%), two-wheelers (30.3%), auto-rickshaws (6%) and other non-motorized traffic (3.9%). Statistical models have been developed to predict on-roadway pollutant concentrations in terms of specific vehicle counts, and weather parameters (temperature, wind speed). Results suggest that two-wheelers and auto-rickshaws significantly impact PM concentrations. Concentrations of BC are a strong function of heavy duty traffic (buses and trucks), two-wheelers and cars. Ozone and CO2 have a strong temperature dependence while NO2 concentrations are a function of both temperature and wind parameters. Wind speed was identified as a key parameter in majority of the prediction models that were developed.",

In order to accommodate more growth, sustainable fresh water resource management will need to be included in future development plans. One of the major environmental issues of concern to policy-makers is the increased vulnerability of ground water quality. The main challenge for the sustainability of water resources is the control of water pollution. To understand the sustainability of the water resources, one needs to understand the impact of future land use and climate changes on the natural resources. Providing safe water and basic sanitation to meet the Millennium Development Goals will require substantial economic resources, sustainable technological solutions and courageous political will. A balanced approach to water resources exploitation for development, on the one hand, and controls for the protection of health, on the other, is required if the benefits of both are to be realized without avoidable detrimental effects manifesting themselves. Meeting the millennium development goals for water and sanitation in the next decade will require substantial economic resources, sustainable technological solutions and courageous political will. In addition to providing “improved” water and “basic” sanitation services, we must ensure that these services provide: safe drinking water, adequate quantities of water for health, hygiene, agriculture and development and sustainable sanitation approaches to protect health and the environment.",

A key to understanding critical zone functions is understanding the flow of energy, and we can measure temperature as a way of looking at energy transfer between related systems. In this study we installed a Distributed Temperature Sensor (DTS) and fiber-optic cable in a zero-order stream at 9,000 ft in the Medicine Bow National Forest in southern Wyoming. We measured the temperature of the stream for 17 days from June 29 to July 16; the first 12 days were mostly sunny with occasional afternoon storms, and the last 5 experienced powerful, long-lasting storms for much of the day. The DTS measurements show a seasonal warming trend of both minimum and maximum stream temperature for the first 12 days, followed by a distinct cooling trend for the five days that experienced heavy storm activity. To gain insights into the timing and mechanisms of energy flow through the critical zone systems, we analyzed the timing of stream temperature change relative to solar short-wave radiation, and compared the stream temperature temporal response to the temporal response of soil temperature adjacent to the stream. Since convective thunderstorms are a dominant summer weather pattern in sub-alpine regions in the Rocky Mountains, this study gives us further insight into interactions of critical zone processes and weather in mountain ecosystems.",

The spatial variability of distribution of ore element caused by cascade mineralization processes can be modeled by multifractal modeling. The singularities observed in the element concentration geochemical maps can be used for delineating target areas for mineral exploration. In this paper we provide a detailed and comprehensive geological investigation of element concentration in regolith over mineralized rocks. Several drill cores from a Mo-W-Ag hydrothermal mineral deposit were selected to study the migration of elements in the regolith. Soils in the top section of these drill cores were systematically analyzed using pXRF on-site and other analytical devices in the lab. About 33 samples from the 10-m section of regolith were analyzed for multiple elements compositions, mineral and clay compositions, grain morphology, grain size distribution, and phase of element occurrence in the rock debris and clay of regolith. Various statistical distribution models have been applied to describe the distributions of the above analytical quantities. These include a two-peak grain size distribution of the regolith indicating multiples formation of the regolith such as deeply weathered rock debris and sands and transported clay sediments. Power-law distributions are observed in vertical concentration distribution of some ore elements in the regolith. Ore element Mo is mainly concentrated on the surface of the fine grain clay but not in the grain of sand and rock debris which implies that the concentration of Mo might be due to element migration process from the altered rocks under the regolith.",

Its location is ideal to record shifts in regional ocean and atmospheric circulation and contains vast stores of carbon-rich peatlands, yet paleoclimate records from this area are scarce. This research aims to provide new paleo-proxy records that document carbon dynamics, precipitation, and temperature over the Holocene.\nWe focus on site C4 (54.02 N, 156.13 E) located 18 km from OS coast at 91 m elevation and draw comparisons with site C1 (54.91 N, 156.60 E) which is 62 km from the coast at 256 m elevation, both in the Western Lowland (WL) region. Cores C1 and C4 are 450 and 375 cm in length, respectively. C4 and C1 were analyzed for organic matter (OM) content; while C4 received additional δ-deuterium (δD), plant macrofossil, and fossil pollen analysis. Both cores cover the last 13,000 years from the Western Lowlands (WL); prior to this study no such records existed from the WL or the eastern OS coastline. Chronologies are based on radiocarbon dating of fine fraction bulk peat and Sphagnum plant macrofossils.\nAt both sites, peat accumulation began 11 ka (1 ka = 1000 calibrated years before present), is continuous to the surface, interlayered with tephra, and overlays a clay unit with 20% OM. OM density measured at 1 cm intervals show similar means of 0.1 g cm-3 over the last 11 ka and, despite the close proximity of the sites (103 km), they show two opposing OM trends: Period 1) From 5.8 to 3.5 ka, C1 OM density decreased ~0.10 to 0.06 g cm-3 while C4 increased from ~0.10 to 0.19 g cm-3, and Period 2) from 3.5 to 0.9 ka, C1 OM density increased to ~0.18 g cm-3 while C4 decreased to ~0.11 cm-3. Peat carbon accumulation rate (PCAR) is similar for both periods in C1 and C4 at 20.1 and 14.1 g m-2 yr-1, respectively. Prior to 5.8 ka PCAR in C1 and C4 is ~30 g m-2 yr-1 in the early Holocene, decreasing to 19 g m-2 yr-1 in the Mid- Late Holocene. C4 shows large PCAR increase to 50 g m-2 yr-1 from 8-7 ka. Paleoenvironmental syntheses of the WL show Period 1 and Period 2 correspond to cooling and warming phases, respectively, while a wet-temperate phase corresponds with higher PCAR in C4. Disagreement in C4 and C1 might be related to proximity with the OS; reflecting shifts in OS circulation and sea ice cover. Pending results of Sphagnum ðD from C4 might serve as a proxy for the OS.",

            "abstract": "The Hyper-Angular Rainbow Polarimeter HARP instrument is a wide field-of-view imager that splits three spatially identical images into three independent polarizers and detector arrays. This technique achieves simultaneous imagery of the same ground target in three polarization states and is the key innovation to achieve high polarimetric accuracy with no moving parts. The spacecraft consists of a 3U CubeSat with 3-axis stabilization designed to keep the image optics pointing nadir during data collection but maximizing solar panel sun pointing otherwise. The hyper-angular capability is achieved by acquiring overlapping images at very fast speeds.\nAn imaging polarimeter with hyper-angular capability can make a strong contribution to characterizing cloud properties. Non-polarized multi-angle measurements have been shown to be sensitive to thin cirrus and can be used to provide climatology of these clouds. Adding polarization and increasing the number of observation angles allows for the retrieval of the complete size distribution of cloud droplets, including accurate information on the width of the droplet distribution in addition to the currently retrieved e­ffective radius.\nThe HARP mission is funded by the NASA Earth Science Technology Office as part of In-Space Validation of Earth Science Technologies (InVEST) program. The HARP instrument is designed and built by a team of students and professionals lead by Dr. Vanderlei Martines at University of Maryland, Baltimore County.

            "abstract": "Diffusion invokes micron-scale exchange during crystal growth and dissolution in magma chambers on short time-scales. Fundamental to interpreting such data are assumptions on magma-fluid dynamics at all scales. Nevertheless, elemental diffusion profiles are used to estimate time scales for magma storage, eruption, and recharge.\nAn underutilized timepiece to evaluate diffusion and 3D mobility of magmatic fluids is high-precision Re-Os dating of molybdenite. With spatially unique molybdenite samples from a young ore system (e.g., 1 Ma) and a double Os spike, analytical errors of 1-3 ka unambiguously separate events in time. Re-Os ages show that hydrous shallow magma chambers locally recharge and expel Cu-Mo-Au-silica as superimposed stockwork vein networks at time scales less than a few thousand years [1]. Re-Os ages provide diffusion rates controlled by a dynamic crystal mush, accumulation and expulsion of metalliferous fluid, and magma reorganization after explosive crystallization events.\nImportantly, this approach has broad application far from ore deposits. Here, we use Re-Os dating of molybdenite to assess time scales for generating and diffusing metals through the deep crust. To maximize opportunity for chemical diffusion, we use a continental-scale Sveconorwegian mylonite zone for the study area.\nA geologically constrained suite of molybdenite samples was acquired from quarry exposures. Molybdenite, previously unreported, is extremely scarce. Tiny but telling molybdenites include samples from like occurrences to assure geologic accuracy in Re-Os ages. Ages range from mid-Mesoproterozoic to mid-Neoproterozoic, and correspond to early metamorphic dehydration of a regionally widespread biotite-rich gneiss, localized melting of gneiss to form cm-m-scale K-feldspar ± quartz pods, development of vapor-rich, vuggy mm stringers that serve as volatile collection surfaces in felsic leucosomes, and low-angle (relative to foliation) cross-cutting cm-scale quartz veins. Re-Os ages and detailed geologic observation document a 200 m.y. history of metal liberation and diffusion through oxidation.\n[1] Stein, H.J.

This study represent the first of this kind in this lagoon. The Alvardo Coastal Lagoon sustains several economical fisheres in the region, including the shrimp fishery. The inlet of the Alvarado Coastal Lagoon is a microtidal rivermouth estuary. In each survey, towed ADCP and hydrographic data were sampled during a diurnal tidal cycle for three across-inlet transects located near the mouth. 12 track repetitions were completed allowing to distinguish the subtidal and tidal signals. In both runoff conditions a salt wedge was present, and showed surface-bottom salinity difference up to 35 psu. During high river discharge condition the salt wedge was present only during flood tide. The thicknesses of the interface, and upper and bottom layers oscillated according the tide. The water surface layer was always toward the ocean. During low river discharge condition the salt wedge was present for the whole tidal cycle. The vertical position of the interface oscillated as the tide did but keeping a constant thickness.",

The effect of light elements on density and bulk modulus of liquid iron is necessary for estimating of these core compositions. Sound velocity of liquid iron alloys is also important for identifying light elements in the core by comparison with observed seismic data.\n In this study, we have measured density and sound velocity of liquid Fe-C at SPring-8 beamline BL22XU using a DIA-type cubic anvil press (SMAP-I). Density was measured using X-ray absorption method (Katayama et al., 1993). We newly installed sound velocity measurement system using pulse-echo overlapping method (Higo et al., 2009) in this beamline. P-wave signals with a frequency of 35-37 MHz were generated and received by LiNbO3 transducer. Buffer rod and backing plated were adopted single-crystal sapphire. The sample length at high pressure and high temperature were measured from absorption contrast between sample and sapphire.\n We measured velocity and density of liquid Fe-C between 1.1-2.8 GPa and 1480-1740 K. Obtained density and velocity of Fe-C was found to increase with pressure. In contrast, the effect of temperature on density and velocity was negative. The relationship between these two properties will be discussed.",

Resolving the tempo and mode of the millennial-scale mega-earthquakes is a cardinal challenge of current paleoseimologic reserach. Coseismic turbidites give us an opportunity to reveal recurrence history and suppercyles of such prehistoric great earthquakes.\nWe investigated three piston cores from landward slope basins in the Nankai Trough off Muroto, southwest Japan, in order to detect Holocene paleoearthquake history. Tow of three, Cores KR9705P1 and KR9911PC1 were obtain from the Tosabae Trough, and the other Core KR9911PC2 from an adjacent landward slope basin. Each turbidities layer from those three piston cores were correlated based on the visual core descriptin, CT scan images, magnetic susceptibility, XRF-CS profiles, and grain size analysis.\nMagnetic susceptibility and grain size are sensitive to detect turbidite layers. Also XRF-CS profiles are usefull to detect and characterize those turbidits. Our correlation suggest that average recurrence time interval of turbidites and/or sandy layers was ~150 years and it was almostly equivalent to those of historic earthquakes for last 7 k.y.\nTosabae trough are filling with a total of ~260m thick stratified sediments and sedimentary sequance of this isolated basin has a potential to be a paleoseismometer of the Nankai Great Earthquakes for last the 200-400 kyrs for to understand the tempo and mode of subduction earthquakes under different climatic conditions.",

While these cities only occupy 2% of the world’s surface, the ecological footprint by these cities combined is far greater than that of the other 98% of the world. Bangkok, Thailand has experienced this rapid urbanization that has resulted in various environmental problems, including pollution, land subsidence, and flooding. Major flooding in 2011 has raised awareness about the importance of restoring ecosystem services in urban space to cope up with the forecasted extreme climatic conditions. Finding localized flooding, carbon and pollution mitigation methods will be important to cities. Upland reforestration has been proposed as a way to decrease these anthropogenic and climate change impacts. However, there is also a large area of wetlands in Bangkok with possibly high ecosystem services that have not been quantified. This study measure above ground and below ground carbon accumulation in wide-spread Typha angustifolia wetlands as an untapped source of ecosystem services that are worth projected. These wetlands are typically viewed as wasteland and are not being protected. We examined carbon and heavy metals (Pb, Zn, Cu) pools in 7 wetlands across Bangkok with various environmental settings--from industrialized zone, to residential area, farms, and protected urban green space. The results indicate recent peat accumulation layer by these wetlands at high rate. Heavy concentration are found near contaminant source such as industries and farms. Combined with their ability to buffer storms and being habitats for wildlife, these wetlands have important values in increasing ecosystem services in urban space and should be considered for protection.",

            "abstract": "Sudden rises in sea water over and above astronomical tides due to an approaching storm are known as storm surges. The development of an early warning system for storm surges is imperative, due to the high threat level of these events; Typhoon Haiyan in 08 November 2013 generated storm surges that caused casualties of over 6,000. Under the Department of Science and Technology, the Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards (DOST - Project NOAH) was tasked to generate storm surge hazard maps for all the coastal areas in the Philippines. The objective of this paper is to create guidelines on how to utilize the storm surge hazard map as a tool for planning and disaster mitigation. This study uses the case of the hypothetical situation in which a tropical storm with an intensity similar to Typhoon Haiyan hits Metro Manila. This site was chosen for various reasons, among them the economic, political, and cultural importance of Metro Manila as the location of the capital of the Philippines and the coastal bay length of the area. The concentration of residential areas and other establishments were also taken into account. Using the Japan Meteorology Association (JMA) Storm Surge Model, FLO-2D flood modelling software and the application of other GIS technology, the impact of Haiyan-strength typhoon passing through Manila was analysed. We were able to identify the population affected, number of affected critical facilities under each storm surge hazard level, and possible evacuation sites. The results of the study can be used as the basis of policies involving disaster response and mitigation by city authorities. The methods used by the study can be used as a replicable framework for the analysis of other sites in the Philippines.",

Multiple tracer evidence at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) particularly show that the water originated from the North Atlantic (NADW) was shoaler than the present day ocean and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) may have been weaker. Athough it is expected to be a good test for the fully coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (GCM) which are used for future climate projection, many models forced with glacial condition, however, fail to simulate the glacial AMOC, which is an obstacle to understand the response of ocean to climatic forcings. Here we analyse multi-climate models including the latest CMIP5/PMIP experiments and show that most of the climate models show a stronger and deeper AMOC associated with the insufficient cooling in the LGM Southern ocean. We further show that the models which fail to have shoeler glacial AMOC is even strengthened because of the feedback between the AMOC, sea ice and wind stress in the north Atlantic. Our additional study using MIROC AOGCM show that by eliminating the warm bias at southern ocean, which most of the climate models suffer from, the sufficiently vigorous Antarctic bottom water formation under glacial condition and proxies (MARGO and delta 13C) can be simulated. We suggest that the improvement of cloud scheme in GCM atmosphere-ocean-ice processes in the high latitude region and sufficient calculation to obtain the equilibrium state especially around Antarctica is crucial for more appropriate AMOC simulation both for the glacial and future climate change.",

Previous studies have emphasized the importance of accurately delineating shoreline in coastal management, engineering design, sea-level rise research, coastal hazard map development, boundary definition, coastal change research and monitoring and numerical models. In the context of storm surge modelling, shoreline boundary serves as basis for tidal conditions and requires to be well-defined to generate an accurate simulation result. This paper presents the cost-effective way of shoreline tracing employed by the Storm Surge component under the Department of Science and Technology-Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards (DOST-Project NOAH) for use in modelling storm surge hazards in the country, particularly in San Pedro Bay during the Typhoon Haiyan. Project NOAH was tasked to conduct disaster science research and development and recommend innovative information services in government's disaster prevention and mitigation efforts through cutting edge technologies. The Storm Surge component commenced in September 2013 and was mandated by the Philippine government to identify storm surge vulnerable areas and provide high-resolution maps of storm surge inundation in the localities. In the absence of LIDAR data at the time, the Project utilized the freely available medium to high resolution satellite images of Google Earth and digitized the shoreline. To minimize subjectivity, set of digitizing standards were developed for classifying common shoreline features in the country, differentiating image textures and colors and tabulating identified shoreline features. After which, the digitized shoreline were quality checked and corrected for topology using ArcGIS Desktop 10 software. The final output is a vector data that served as boundary for topo-bathy extraction, storm surge model mesh generation, and model tidal boundary set up. Moreover, the exercise also identifies natural and engineering barriers against storm surges. The output can also be used in future projects involving those mentioned above, including building the localities’ shoreline resiliency against storm surge events.",

There is empirical evidence that the spectral signatures of Saturnian water ice particles are indicative of their impact speed. Based on a detailed analysis of mass spectra recorded by CDA at the same E ring location, but at different spacecraft speeds, we devised a technique to accurately determine the speeds of E ring particles hitting CDA. This will allow us for the first time to characterize the dynamical properties of the E ring particles, which is the prerequisite for an in-depth understanding of the ring dynamics.",

The Hawaiʻi Natural Energy Institute (HNEI) is developing an operational system in order to research and test new techniques to generate solar forecasts for the Hawaiian Islands. The operational system comprises the following three components.\n(i) A ground-observation-based advection model, using sky imagers and a ceilometer located at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. Every 10 minutes (during daylight hours), this component generates a high-resolution 1 hour Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) prediction for a region that is within ~15 km of the instrumentation.\n(ii) A satellite-image-based advection model, using Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) imagery and the Heliosat-II method. Every 30 minutes (during daylight hours), this component generates a 1 km resolution, 6 hour GHI prediction for the entire Hawaiian Archipelago.\n(iii) A coupled ocean-atmosphere model, using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) model and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, including newly available microphysics, shallow convection parameterization, and radiative transfer model options. Nightly, this component generates 48 hour GHI, Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI), and Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI) predictions for (a) a 10 km resolution domain covering the full Hawaiian Archipelago and (b) a nested 2 km resolution domain covering the islands of Maui, Oʻahu, and Hawaiʻi.\nWe discuss the development and validation of the system, and the scales of forecasting accuracy for each component. We also examine the impact of the coupled model on the simulations of surface flux processeses and ocean-atmosphere feedbacks, both of which influence the prediction of regional cloud properties.",

            "abstract": "Croplands are typically characterized by fine-scale heterogeneity, which makes it difficult to accurately estimate cropland carbon fluxes over large regions given the fairly coarse spatial resolution of high-frequency satellite observations. It is, however, important that we improve our ability to estimate spatially and temporally resolved carbon fluxes because croplands constitute a large land area and have a large impact on global carbon cycle. A Satellite based Dynamic Cropland Carbon (SDCC) modeling framework was developed to estimate spatially resolved crop specific daily carbon fluxes over large regions. This modeling framework uses the REGularized canopy reFLECtance (REGFLEC) model to estimate crop specific leaf area index (LAI) using downscaled MODIS reflectance data, and subsequently LAI estimates are integrated into the Environmental Policy Integrated Model (EPIC) model to determine daily net primary productivity (NPP) and net ecosystem productivity (NEP). Firstly, we evaluate the performance of this modeling framework over three eddy covariance flux tower sites (Bondville, IL; Fermi Agricultural Site, IL; and Rosemount site, MN). Daily NPP and NEP of corn and soybean crops are estimated (based on REGFLEC LAI) for year 2007 and 2008 over the flux tower sites and compared against flux tower observations and model estimates based on in-situ LAI. Secondly, we apply the SDCC framework for estimating regional NPP and NEP for corn, soybean and sorghum crops in Nebraska during year 2007 and 2008. The methods and results will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Flooding has been a perennial problem in the city of Marikina. These incidences result in human and economic losses. In response to this, the city has been investing in their flood disaster mitigation program in the past years. As a result, flooding in Marikina was reduced by 31% from 1992 to 2004. [1] However, these measures need to be improved so as to mitigate the effects of floods with more than 100 year return period, such as the flooding brought by tropical storm Ketsana in 2009 which generated 455mm of rains over a 24-hour period. Heavy rainfall caused the streets to be completely submerged in water, leaving at least 70 people dead in the area. In 2012, the Southwest monsoon, enhanced by a typhoon, brought massive rains with an accumulated rainfall of 472mm for 22-hours, a number greater than that which was experienced during Ketsana. At this time, the local government units were much more prepared in mitigating the risk with the use of early warning and evacuation measures, resulting to zero casualty in the area. Their urban disaster management program, however, can be further improved through the integration of high-resolution 2D flood hazard maps in the city’s flood disaster management. The use of these maps in flood disaster management is essential in reducing flood-related risks. This paper discusses the importance and advantages of integrating flood maps in structural and non-structural mitigation measures in the case of Marikina City. Flood hazard maps are essential tools in predicting the frequency and magnitude of floods in an area. An information that may be determined with the use of these maps is the locations of evacuation areas, which may be accurately positioned using high-resolution 2D flood hazard maps. Evacuation of areas that are not vulnerable of being inundated is one of the unnecessary measures that may be prevented and thus optimizing mitigation efforts by local government units. This paper also discusses proposals for a more efficient exchange of information, allowing for flood simulations to be utilized in local flood disaster management programs. The success of these systems relies heavily on the knowledge of the people involved. As environmental changes create more significant impacts, the need to adapt to these is vital for man’s safety.\n[1] Pacific Disaster Center",

            "abstract": "Kerogen is defined as the insoluble fraction of organic matter preserved in sediments. Due to its structural complexity, kerogen is poorly understood, yet it holds vast economic importance as petroleum source rock, and represents the largest organic carbon pool on earth. Kerogen originates from a mixture of organic biomolecules and tends to be dominated by the polymeric components of cell walls and cellular membranes, which undergo interactions with sedimentary minerals at elevated temperature and pressure upon burial. Due to the importance of burial diagenesis to petroleum formation, much of our knowledge of chemical properties of kerogens is related to diagenetic and catagenetic effects. The more common geochemical evaluations of the oil and gas potentials of source rock are based upon proximate analyses such as hydrogen and oxygen indices and thermal stability indices, such as those provided by Fisher assay and Rock Eval®. However, proximate analyses provide limited information regarding the chemical structure of kerogens, and therefore provide little insight to the processes of kerogen formation. NMR spectra of kerogen have been previously shown to be useful in estimating oil and gas potential, and the proposed study seeks to refine nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as a tool in kerogen characterization, specifically for the purpose of oil and gas potential calculations.",

The Shihmen reservoir had a natural drainage area of 762.4 km2 and located at the northern Taiwan. Due to serious sediment deposition problem from 2004 induced by Typhoon AERE, the stratified withdraw facility was built at dam site to avoid the lack of public water and the one of venting tunnel of power plant was designed to vent turbidity current (Fig. 1(a)).\nIn 2013, the sediment venting tunnel was first operated during Typhoon Soulik and abundant sediment was released to the downstream river. The 2D numerical model with sediment transport consideration was adopted to investigate morphological impact of downstream river, especially at Jiangzicui area in Fig. 1(b). Due to ecological wet land, flood diversion work and ferry boat transportation were concentrated in this area, the sediment transportation and morphological impact is important to be realized. The Fig. 1(b) shows the original morphological bed form before sediment releasing from sediment venting tunnel and Fig. 1(c) shows the simulation results after sediment releasing from sediment venting. It seems 0.2 m morphological changing due to this operation. Fig. 1(d) is the field morphological survey after Typhoon Soulik and comparison to Fig. 1 (b), not significantly deposition or erosion is observed. According to the grain size of released sediment from Shihmen reservoir, d50 is approximately 10 μm and it is belonged to fine sediment. Therefore, the released sediment is classified clay and for the morphological impact is not significantly. So, morphological impact of downstream river below Shihmen dam due to reservoir desiltation operation is unapparent after Typhoon Soulik at Jiangzicui area.\nKeywords: venting tunnel, turbid current, morphological impact, 2D numerical model.\nFigure 1 (a) Sketch of sediment venting tunnel and power plant tunnel; (b)Morphological bed elevation before sediment released operation; (c) Simulated morphological impact of 2D numerical model； (d) Morphological survey after sediment released operation.",

            "abstract": "New geophysical data help define modern flat-slab subduction in the central Andes, but the geologic consequences of slab shallowing in Peru remain poorly resolved. In better-documented regions of North and South America, changes in subduction architecture have been linked to arc migration, orogenic advance, and shifts in deformation style and kinematics. New structural, sedimentary, and geo/thermochronologic results for southern Peru support a reconstruction of Oligocene-Miocene deformation and sedimentation across the Western Cordillera magmatic arc, Altiplano hinterland plateau, Eastern Cordillera fold-thrust belt, and Subandean foreland basin. The spatial and temporal distribution of Andean shortening and basin subsidence in this region encompass a major phase of arc migration that has been attributed to shallowing of the subducting Nazca slab. Detrital zircon U-Pb ages for syndeformational growth strata pinpoint the timing of key forethrust and backthrust systems (Tinajani and Ayaviri faults, respectively) that partitioned the early foreland basin into a smaller, rapidly subsiding hinterland basin (Ayaviri basin) in the Altiplano plateau. A roughly 28 Ma activation of the basement-involved Ayaviri backthrust along the Altiplano-Eastern Cordillera boundary matches the mid-Oligocene activation age reported for the entire central Andean backthrust belt, which persists for >500 km along strike southward into Bolivia. The Ayaviri structure potentially represents a reactivated deep-seated Triassic normal fault and/or an inherited crustal-scale boundary. Subsequent Miocene activation of the Tinajani forethrust and coeval thrust-related exhumation within the Eastern Cordillera are suggestive of distributed regional shortening during flat-slab subduction. Available data suggest a spatiotemporal coincidence of shallow subduction in southern Peru with inboard arc migration, basement-involved shortening, and focused rapid subsidence in the Altiplano plateau.",

            "abstract": "The governing equations for reactive transport, under appropriate conditions, satisfy many important mathematical properties and physical constraints. To name a few: maximum principles, comparison principles, monotone property, and the non-negative constraint. Unfortunately, conventional numerical methods to solve the reactive transport equations violate these important mathematical properties and physical constraints. For example, one may obtain non-physical values (negative concentrations) under conventional numerical methods, particularly for cases with highly heterogeneous flow fields, irregular grids and full tensor dispersion. Negative concentrations cannot be tolerated when transport is coupled to nonlinear reactions.\nIn this presentation, we discuss the performance of finite element formulations with respect to maximum principles, comparison principles, monotone property, and the non-negative constraints. We shall show that the approach of placing restrictions on the mesh and time-step is not always possible. We shall also show that the consistent Newton-Raphson, which is a standard iterative procedure for solving nonlinear problems, needs preserve these important mathematical properties for semi-linear and quasi-linear diffusion models. We will show that the Pao’s method (which is based on Picard linearization) with mesh restrictions can be a viable option for solving semi-linear diffusion models. We shall also discuss the numerical convergence properties of the Pao method. Finally, we shall present optimization-based methods for steady state and transient diffusion models to meet some of these properties. The performance of various approaches will be illustrated using bimolecular (both slow and fast) reactions.",

            "abstract": "In the era of air pollution and climate change, we should have reliable outlooks of national air pollutant and GHGs emission, which are also important components of international environmental policy negotiation. The Greenhouse gas – Air pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) model has been developed as a tool to identify reasonable emission forecast and mitigation strategies that achieve air quality and greenhouse gas related targets simultaneously at least cost. Recently, Konkuk University and IIASA has been jointly developing the GAINS-Korea Model by reflecting domestic emission activities and environmental conditions. One of the most important challenges for developing GAINS-Korea model is to reproduce CAPSS – the national emissions inventory of Korea- in the GAINS framework. Matching two different databases are not easy because of different sector classification schemes, estimation methods, and etc. In this study, we developed a base year emissions of the GAINS-Korea for the criteria air pollutants using CAPSS. A new set of methodologies to link national inventory to international framework (GAINS) were introduced so that the GAINS-Korea can produce realistic emission outlooks and test control alternatives. We will discuss several underlying issues, such as improvement of accuracy for mapping, conversion, for our base year emission inventory development in site.",

            "abstract": "Scaling in many systems is often represented by a global Hurst exponent from the data. However, many cases show a crossover in scaling thus yielding two sub ranges of time windows with different scaling exponents. The crossover point is an important feature of the system but its computation is often complicated. A scale invariance in the two regimes with asymptotic behavior before and after the crossover suggests a hyperbolic fit for the fluctuation functions. Consequently a hyperbolic regression scheme is used to compute the crossover point (the center of the hyperbola) and the respective Hurst exponents (slopes of asymptotes). In the case of magnetospheric dynamics this method yields a measure of the time scales in the AL data before and after the crossover which are in agreement with previous studies that used power spectral density (PSD) or structure function (SF) to characterize the scaling break/crossover. Furthermore, a comparison of the crossover phenomenon in AL data to those from several theoretical models yields a Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Langevin (OUL) model which is then used for robust estimates of the crossover time by calculating its variance using multi-trajectory ensemble approach. The fluctuation analysis of AL data detrended using expected values from OUL model is shown to have no crossovers, unlike detrending by persistence or DFA of AL data, thus providing a new understanding of crossover phenomenon in fluctuation analysis.",

            "abstract": "Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is considered by many to be the “gold standard” for chemical identification, providing a direct connection between chemical compounds found in the laboratory and those found in natural samples including remote astrophysical environments. However, a well known limitation of using conventional IR spectroscopy is its spatial resolution determined by the wavelength of IR photons. Thus, while other techniques such as XANES and micro-Raman are capable of limited functional group mapping at tens to hundreds of nanometers, their use is limited by accessibility (the need for synchrotron beamlines) or the need for intense irradiation conditions (Raman) that can lead to sample alteration. These limitations and the wealth of information that can be extracted from detailed studies of unique micron-sized samples brought back by recent sample return missions such as NASA’s Stardust mission, have motivated the development of a novel infrared mapping technique that is capable of mapping the chemical functional properties of geochemical samples with submicron resolutions.\nHere we describe our nano-FTIR imaging and analysis technique that allows us to bypass diffraction limited sample imaging in the infrared. Here we show, for the first time, that 1) the combination of an atomic-force microscope (AFM) and laser can be used to obtain the FTIR-equivalent spectra on spatial scales that are much smaller than the wavelength of IR radiation used 2) this technique responds to subtle shifts in cation concentrations as evidenced by changes in the frequencies of phonons at sub-micron scales 3) this technique can be used to identify regions of crystalline and semi-crystalline materials as demonstrated in our analysis of a cometary dust grain Iris. This work has clear implications for interpretations of astronomical observations and adds a new technique for the non-destructive characterization of terrestrial and extraterrestrial samples.",

However, the reduction of sediment is a complicated planning issue as a result of the competing land uses from the demands to satisfy food production needs and from economic development, among others. Moreover, despite the significance of sedimentation as a threat to coral reefs, historical baseline and future estimates of sediment discharge on coral reefs remains poorly quantified. Therefore, the effectiveness of this strategy hinges upon (i) identifying the future sediment discharge on coral reefs relative to historical baseline, and (ii) on identifying spatially where sediment reduction actions are urgently needed and where they are likely to succeed. We provide this understanding by simulating sediment dynamics for historical and future time scales using models of land use and climate, for coastal watersheds adjacent coral reefs where they are found globally.",

Thus, analysis of such macromolecule may serve as new technique for paleobotanical evaluation distinctive from classical paleobotnical studies depends on morphological preservation of fossils. In the present study, we analyzed plant fossils and kerogens in sediments from the Cretaceous strata in Japan to examine chemotaxonomic characteristics of fossil macromolecules and to reconstruct paleovegetation change by kerogen analysis. The kerogens were separated from the powdered sediments of Cretaceous Yezo Group, Hokkaido, Japan. All kerogens have been confirmed to be mostly originated from land plant tissues by microscopic observation. Mummified angiosperm and gymnosperm fossil leaves were separated from carbonaceous sandstone of the Cretaceous Ashizawa Formation, Futaba Group. The kerogens and plant fossils were extracted with methanol and dichloromethane, and were subsequently refluxed under 110°C to remove free compounds completely. The residues are hydrolyzed by KOH/methanol under 110°C. These released compounds are analyzed by GC-MS. As main hydrolyzed products (ester-bound molecular units) from all kerogens, C10-C28 n-alkanoic acids and C10-C30 n-alkanols were detected. Recent studies on the hydrolysis products of plant tissues suggested the long chain (>C20) n-alkanols were predominantly abundant in deciduous broadleaved angiosperms. Correspondingly, the stratigraphic variation of the ratios of long chain (>C20) n-alkanols to fatty acids was concordant with the variation of angiosperm/gymnosperm ratios recorded by land plant-derived terpenoid biomarkers. In addition, we found that the long chain n-alkanols/fatty acids ratio in the angiosperm fossil leaf was significantly higher than that of conifer fossil leaf from Ashizawa coal bed. From these results, we propose that the proportions of long chain n-alkanols released from terrigenous kerogens are applicable for paleovegetation reconstruction.",

            "abstract": "In-channel structures, i.e. cross-vanes and J-hooks, are commonly installed in river restoration projects to modify the streambed morphology and stream water surface profile, and are known to change hyporhiec exchange flux and habitats for riverine animals. However, few studies have continuous and accurate pre- and post-treatment data to evaluate the impact of these structures on channel hydraulic gradients and morphology. To quantify the effects of in-channel structures, we developed a scaled physical model of a meandering stream with a cross-vane and 6 J-hooks on a mobile-bed river table. Close-range photogrammetry technique was applied to obtain 3-D water and ground surface profiles with sub-millimeter vertical accuracy and horizontal resolution. The experiment was compared with a control experiment without structures while maintaining the same initial conditions of river bed, floodplain and stream flow. Results indicated that the cross-vane caused an average local head loss that represented 16% of the total stream reach head loss, and a 74% increase in channel load in the entire stream reach. Most J-hooks can create stepwise patterns in stream longitudinal profile, and cross-vane can create even more significant ones. Hydraulic gradients across the intra-meander zone also increased with in-channel structures, i.e. from 2.5% to 3.5% at the meander neck. Scour pools developed downstream of the cross-vane, and mostly around the 4 meander apex J-hooks at their hooked tip. Backwater caused by the cross-vane steepened the local water table profile by an additional 4.2%, and was the primary driver of statistically significant hydraulic gradient increase. Reach scale water and streambed surface profiles from our study provided detailed data to improve the understanding of in-channel structure effects, and may serve as reliable data source in computational modeling of hyporheic exchange.",

A total of 76 PHR events and 45 break events in the summers of 1979-2011 are firstly identified over the MLYRV, and divide into early and late summer groups. During the PHR events over the MLYRV for both groups, the WPSH stretches more westward, accompanied by the positive anomalies of 500-hPa geopotential height field over East Asia and its coastal region south of 30ºN, and the subseasonal warmer SSTs beneath the WPSH western edge. The time-lagged composites suggest that the WPSH western edge exhibits westward-then-eastward migration on subseasonal time-scale for the PHR events. The zonal changes of the WPSH and anomalous circulation and SSTA signals for break events is almost the mirror image of that for PHR ones for the early summer group. Accompanied by the WPSH westward extension, the increased incident solar radiation and decreased latent heat flux over the coastal region of East Asia contribute to the positive SSTAs beneath the western part of the WPSH. The positive SSTAs construct a convective instability that provides adverse condition for maintaining the anti-cyclonic anomalies in the mid-lower levels. The persistent SST warming is also favorable to the transition of low-level circulation from anti-cyclonic to cyclonic anomalies over the coastal region. Resultantly, the WPSH withdraws eastward after the peak of the rainfall events over the MLYRV.",

            "abstract": "Surface environment of Hadean Earth is a key to bear life on the Earth. All of previous works assumed that high pCO2 has been decreased to a few bars in the first a few hundreds millions of years (e.g., Zhanle et al., 2011). However, this process is not easy because of material and process barriers as shown below. Four barriers are present. First, the ultra-acidic pH (<0.1) of 4.4Ga ocean prevented the precipitation of carbonates at mid-oceanic ridge through water-rock interaction after the birth of primordial ocean driven by plate tectonics or pseudo-plate tectonics system. To overcome this barrier, primordial (anorthosite + KREEP) continents must have been above sea-level to increase pH rapidly through hydrological process. Second, major cap rocks on the Hadean oceanic crust must have been komatiite with minor basaltic rocks to precipitate carbonates through water-rock interaction and transport them into mantle through subduction at higher than the intermediate P/T geotherm on the Benioff plane. If not, carbonate minerals are all decarbonated at shallower depths than the Moho plane. Komatiite production depends on mantle potential temperature which must have been rapidly decreased to yield only Fe-enriched MORB by 3.8Ga.\n Third, the primordial continents composed of anorthosite with subordinate amounts of KREEP basalts must have been annihilated by 4.0Ga to alter pH to be possible to precipitate carbonates by hydrothermal process. The value of pCO2 must have been decreased down to a few bars from c.a. 50 bars at TSI (total surface irradiance) = 75% under the restricted time limit. If failed, the Earth must have been Venus state which is impossible to bear life on the planet.\n Fourth is the role of tectonic erosion to destroy and transport the primordial continent of anorthosite into deep mantle by subduction. Anorthosite + KREEP was the mother’s milk grow life on the Earth, but disappeared by 4.0Ga or even earlier, but alternatively granites were formed and accumulated on the Earth to supply nutrients for life. This is time-dependent process to increase new continents.\n Fifth is the water content of 3-5km thick, if the value was over, no way to bear life nor evolution afterwards.\n After all, the Hadean Earth has passed the really risky tightrope processes to bear life. If any of above five conditions was lost, life has not been appeared.",

            "abstract": "Amphitheater-headed canyons are primarily distinguished from typical fluvial channels by their abrupt headwall terminations. A key goal in the study of river canyons is to establish a reliable link between form and formation processes. This is of particular significance for Mars, where, if such links can be established, amphitheater-headed canyons could be used to determine ancient erosion mechanisms and, by inference, climate conditions. Type examples in arid regions on Earth, such as in Escalante River, Utah, previously have been interpreted as products of groundwater seepage erosion. We investigate amphitheater-headed canyons in Escalante and Tarantula Mesa where variations in canyon head morphology may hold clues for the relative roles of rock properties and fluvial and groundwater processes. In lower Escalante, amphitheaters are only present where canyons have breached the Navajo Sandstone – Kayenta Formation contact. In some canyons, amphitheater development appears to have been inhibited by an abundance of coarse bedload. In Tarantula Mesa, canyons have a variety of headwalls, from amphitheaters to stepped knickzones. Headwall morphology distribution is directly related to the spatially variable presence of knickpoint-forming, fine-grained interbeds within cliff-forming sandstones. Amphitheaters only form where the sandstone unit is undisrupted by these interbeds. Finally, most canyons in Escalante and Tarantula Mesa, regardless of substrate lithology, amphitheater presence, or groundwater spring intensity, are well described by a slope-area power law relationship with regionally constant concavity and normalized steepness indices. This suggests that all channels here are subject to the same erosion rates, independent of groundwater weathering intensity. Thus: 1) variations in canyon headwall form do not necessary relate to differences in fluvial history, 2) stratigraphic variations are clearly of importance in sedimentary canyon systems, and 3) although groundwater seepage weathering is clearly active in many canyons in Utah and may be responsible for amphitheater development, fluvial forces appear to be the dominant erosive force responsible for shaping stream profiles.",

            "abstract": "The Philippines is one of the countries most vulnerable to storm surge. It is located in the North-western Pacific basin which is the most active basin in the planet. An average of 20 tropical cyclones enters the Philippine area of responsibility (PAR) every year. The archipelagic nature of the country with regions having gently sloping coasts and shallow bays also contribute to the formation of extreme surges. Last November 2013, storm surge brought by super typhoon Haiyan severely damaged several coastal regions in the Visayan Islands. Haiyan left more than 6 300 casualties and damages amounting to more than $ 2 billion. Extreme storm surge events such as this highlight the need to establish a storm surge early warning system for the country. This study explores the development and evaluation of storm surge ensemble forecasting for the Philippines using the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) storm surge model. 36-hour, 24-hour, and 12-hour tropical cyclone forecasts are used to generate an ensemble storm surge forecast to give the most probable storm surge height at a specific point brought by an incoming tropical cyclone. The result of the storm surge forecast is compared to tide gauge record to evaluate the accuracy. The total time of computation and dissemination of forecast result is also examined to assess the feasibility of using the JMA storm surge model for operational purposes.",

            "abstract": "In steep mountainous landscapes, topographic aspect can play a significant role in small-scale (ie. scales in the order of 10’s ha) variability in surface fuel moisture. Experimental sites for monitoring microclimate variables and moisture content in litter and in near-surface soils were established at a control site and on four contrasting aspects (north, south, east and west) in southeast Australia. At each of the four microclimate sites sensors are arranged to measure the soil moisture (2 replicates), surface fuel moisture at 2.5cm depth (12 replicates), precipitation throughfall (3 replicates), radiation (3 replicates), and screen level relative humidity, air temperature, leaf wetness, and wind speed (1 replicate of each). Temperature and relative humidity are also measured within the dead fine surface fuel using Ibutton’s (4 replicates). All measurements are logged continuously at 15 min intervals. The moisture content of the surface fuel is estimated using a novel method involving high-replication of low-cost continuous soil moisture sensors placed at the centre of a 5cm deep sample of fine dead surface fuel, referred to here as “litter-packs”. The litter-packs were constructed from fuels collected from the area surrounding the microclimate site.\nThe initial results show the moisture regime on the forest floor was highly sensitive to the incoming shortwave radiation, which was up to 6 times higher in the north-facing (equatorial) slopes due to slope orientation and the sparse vegetation compared to vegetation on the south-facing (polar facing) slopes. Differences in shortwave radiation resulted in peak temperatures within the litter that were up to 2 times higher on the equatorial-facing site than those on the polar-facing site. For instance, on a day in November 2013 with maximum open air temperature of 35o C, the temperatures within the litter layer at the north-facing and south-facing sites were 54o C and 32o C, respectively, despite air temperature at the two sites differing by less than 2o C. The minimum gravimetric water content in the litter layer on the same day was 21% on the equatorial-facing slope and 85% on the polar-facing slope. The experimental data has been used to calibrate a topographic downscaling algorithm, yielding estimates of surface fuel moisture at 20m resolution.",

            "abstract": "Tropical instability waves (TIWs) are important to ocean dynamics, air-sea interaction, and biogeochemistry. Measurements of sea surface salinity (SSS) from the Aquarius/SAC-D and SMOS missions have demonstrated their capabilities to detect TIWs both in the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans. The accuracy of satellite SSS in representing TIW amplitudes has strong implication to the assimilation of these data in ocean models. The amplitude of SSS variability associated with TIWs inferred from Aquarius Version 2 gridded data has been found to be smaller than that derived from tropical mooring measurements by approximately 25%. One of the potential causes for this difference is the accuracy of the meridional gradients of SSS inferred from Aquarius data. However, existing in-situ data (e.g., from Argo floats) do not provide fine enough spatial resolution to evaluate the relatively fine SSS gradients inferred from Aquarius systematically. Another potential cause is that mooring data are point-wise measurements while Aquarius data represent spatial and temporal averages that are characteristic of Aquarius footprint and sampling pattern. Because high-resolution SST products are available and TIW-related SSS and SST are highly correlated, we examine the effect of Aquarius’ sampling pattern on the estimated TIW amplitude indirectly by sampling a high-resolution SST product based on Aquarius’ spatial and time sampling characteristics then re-create gridded SST maps to estimate the TIW amplitudes. The results suggest that, to a large extent, the smaller amplitudes of TIWs inferred from Version 2 of the Aquarius’ gridded data can be explained by Aquarius’ spatial and temporal sampling.",

The Mars InSight lander is targeting a landing site in Elysium Planitia and the application of the point photoclinometry algorithm that correctly estimated the slope parameters for MER (Beyer et al., 2003) and for MSL (Beyer and Kirk, 2012) is also being applied to HiRISE imagery within the potential landing ellipses being considered. This allows rapid evaluation of slope parameters and also provides a consistency check with terrain models derived from stereo data. The largest source of error in the photoclinometry estimates of slope is the value of the atmospheric haze to subtract for each image. When a stereo-derived terrain model (either from HiRISE or CTX) is present, the slope statistics from that terrain model are used to help 'tune' the photoclinometry-derived slopes for images that overlap that terrain model. In this way better slope data can be extrapolated into nearby regions than the photoclinometry technique alone would be able to accomplish.",

            "abstract": "Water utilities possess a large amount of water data that could be used to inform urban ecohydrology, management decisions, and conservation policies, but such data are rarely analyzed owing to difficulty in analyzation, visualization, and interpretion. We have developed a high performance computing resource for this purpose. We partnered with 6 water agencies in Orange County who provided 10 years of parcel-level monthly water use billing data for a pilot study. The first challenge that we overcame was to refine all human errors and unify the many different formats of data over all agencies. Second, we tested and applied experimental approaches to the data, including complex calculations, with high efficiency. Third, we developed a method to refine the data so it can be browsed along a time series index and/or geo-spatial queries with high efficiency, no matter how large the data. Python scientific libraries were the best match to handle arbitrary data sets in our environment. Further milestones include agency entry, sets of formulae, and maintaining 15M rows X 70 columns of data with high performance of cpu-bound processes. To deal with billions of rows, we performed an analysis virtualization stack by leveraging iPython parallel computing. With this architecture, one agency could be considered one computing node or virtual machine that maintains its own data sets respectively. For example, a big agency could use a large node, and a small agency could use a micro node. Under the minimum required raw data specs, more agencies could be analyzed. The program developed in this study simplifies data analysis, visualization, and interpretation of large water datasets, and can be used to analyze large data volumes from water agencies nationally or worldwide.",

            "abstract": "In order to truly broaden the impact of our scientific community, effective communication should be taught alongside research skills to developing scientists. In the summer of 2014, we incorporated an informal communications course into the 10th year of UNAVCO’s Research Experiences in Solid Earth Science for Students (RESESS), a year-long internship program centered around an 11-week intensive summer research experience. The goals of the newly designed course included giving students the tools they need to make a broader impact with their science, starting now; improving the students’ confidence in public speaking and using social media for outreach; and giving students the tools they need to apply for jobs or graduate school. Specifically, the course included teaching of professional communication skills, such as e-mail and phone etiquette, resume and CV tailoring, and interview techniques, and public communications skills, such as crafting and simplifying messages, visual communication for the public, and public speaking. Student interns were encouraged to step back from the details of their research projects to put their work into a big-picture context relevant to the public and to policy makers.\nThe course benefited from input and/or participation from UNAVCO Education and Community Engagement staff, engineering and managerial staff, and graduate student interns outside the RESESS program, and University of Colorado research and communications mentors already involved in RESESS.\nAs the summer program is already packed with research and skill development, one major challenge was fitting in teaching these communications skills amongst many other obligations: a GRE course, a peer-focused scientific communications course, a computing course, and, of course, research. Can we do it all? This presentation will provide an overview of the course planning, articulation of course goals, and execution challenges and successes. We will present our lessons learned from summer 2014 as well as feedback from both student interns and UNAVCO staff who helped support the course.",

However, its net emissions are lower, about 16 Mt C yr-1, in particular due to CO2 uptake across the land biosphere. This uptake, therefore, plays a crucial role in the country's greenhouse gas budget, yet its magnitude as well as regional distribution are not well-known. Numbers such as above usually represent bottom-up estimates, i.e., are based on local measurements of changes in the various biospheric biomass pools and while they are extensive and very detailed, they are also difficult to upscale to regional and national levels.\nWe have developed a top-down approach to estimate regional sinks and sources of CO2 in New Zealand during 2011-13, which will serve as a complement to the bottom-up estimates. The approach uses a statistical method, Bayesian inversion, to combine CO2 observations from three sites across both Islands with source/sink regions at the surface through modeled atmospheric transport.\nPreliminary results are presented along with a footprint analysis of the three sites (i.e., the sensitivity of the observed CO2 concentration to potential source and sink areas across the country), a description of the observations and a priori information on oceanic and terrestrial sinks and sources.",

            "abstract": "It is projected that localized extreme weather events could increase due to the effects of global warming, resulting in severe weather disasters, such as a torrential rain, floods, and so on. Understanding water vapor’s behavior in the atmosphere is essen- tial to understand a fundamental mechanism of these weather events. Therefore, continuous monitoring system to measure the atmospheric water vapor with good spatio-temporal resolution is required. We have developed several water vapor Raman lidar systems employing the laser wavelengths of 355 and 532 nm. However, the signal-to-noise ratio of the Raman lidar strongly depends on the sky background because of the detection of the weak inelastic scattering of light by molecules. Therefore, these systems were mainly used during nighttime.\nHence, we have newly developed a water vapor Raman lidar using a quadrupled Nd:YAG laser at a wavelength of 266 nm. This wavelength is in the ultraviolet (UV) range below 300 nm known as the ”solar-blind” region, because practically all radiation at these wavelengths is absorbed by the ozone layer in the stratosphere. It has the advantage of having no daytime solar background radiation in the system. The lidar is equipped with a 25 cm receiving telescope and is used for measuring the light separated into an elastic backscatter signal and vibrational Raman signals of nitrogen and water vapor at wavelengths of 266.1, 283.6, and 294.6 nm, respectively. This system can be used for continuous water vapor measurements in the lower troposphere. This study introduces the design of the UV lidar system and shows the preliminary results of water vapor profiles. ",

            "abstract": "The remote sensing community and geospatial industries are embracing the paradigm of ‘big data’. This trend is in one hand due to the fact that heterogeneous remote sensors are producing tremendous amounts of earth observation (EO) data every day; on the other hand it is aspired by the promise that big data computing may be the fourth paradigm for scientific discovery. Many traditional techniques have been developed and will continue to be useful to deal with earth-observation big data, for examples, pansharpening, fusion of data with different electromagnetic nature (e.g. color images and SAR images), and use of multi-sensor data for improved land-cover classification. However, two limitations are recognized for these techniques, which include: (1) first, these methods are tightly dependent on a two-dimensional grid scale; and (2) second, temporal, spatial and causal relations are not intelligently treated. These limitations render them insufficient when used to attack the emerging Disaster Scene Big Data (DSBD).\nDSBD emerges as a geological or climatic hazard unfolds into a disaster. In the example of an earthquake, disaster data starts accruing as the ground shaking is being monitored. Along the time scale, heterogeneous multi-sensor data arise: EO data with various electromagnetic nature, oblique images, airborne/terrestrial active (Lidar) data, and the recently emerged crowdsourcing data. Neither theoretical models nor effective methods exist to date that can sufficiently fuse these data towards revealing the ‘ground-truth’ of the disaster effects, for example, damage to built objects.\nThis presentation will present an augmented evidence-theoretic framework based on the classical Dempster–Shafer theory. With a focus on reasoning the ground-truth of build-object damage, causal, correlational and relational evidences will be defined considering their temporal and spatial scales. The newly developed graph-based learning approach will be explored for estimating the belief-plausibility interval of the ground-truth damage. Case-study using recent earthquake disaster data (e.g. the 2011 Christchurch Earthquake) will be discussed.",

This research are presented results of simulating water movement in one-dimensional variably saturated media for different types of landscape nearby Zvenigorod town (Moscow Region, Russia) in reserve part of Moscow River Valley.\nThere was taking into account 11 different type of landscape. On basis of this 11 model were simulated. Examined models shown the high influence of plants type and ground water levels on infiltration recharge. The most high infiltration recharge was received for second fluvial terrace with forest, sandy soil and ground water level at 10 m deep. For a flood plain was receive the lowest value of infiltration recharge and the highest value of evaporation.",

            "abstract": "Several secondary flow correction methods had been proposed in literature to account for the 3d flow characteristics of secondary circulation which was often lost in depth-averaged models. In order to evaluate their performances in singular bend, successive reverse curvature bends and natural meander rivers, three different typical secondary flow correction methods were applied to a depth-averaged hydrodynamic model, which were Lien(L), Kalkwijk and Booij(K) and modified Finnie(F) methods. There are obviously limits to the descriptive ability of the three methods in simulating sharply bend channels, especially L method which showed qualitative error. As for successive reverse curvature bends and natural meander rivers, K method gave a better performance than the others. F method increased depth-averaged velocities on the outside of curves, while L method overestimated the whole flow field. By the order of magnitude analysis, we found that L method has done the maximum correction for the secondary flow and the minimum correction for transversal velocities was F method. Those three methods were evaluated by multiple performance criteria. The results of this study can provide some references for some practical applications.",

The AMNH produces innovative geoscience and other STEM resources supporting teacher and student science investigations with data visualizations and analysis tools, teaching case materials and other resources that provide rich nonfiction reading and writing opportunities for use in Earth and space science curricula that are integrated in the MAT and PD programs.\nMuseum resources and the MAT and PD programs are aligned to support the recently released Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and the Common Core State Standards. The NGSS is a set of science and engineering practices, crosscutting concepts and disciplinary core ideas to help cultivate teachers’ and K-12 students’ scientific habits of mind, develop their knowledge and abilities to engage in scientific investigations, and teach them how to reason in context; goals that closely align with those of the AMNH's teacher preparation and professional development programs. A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas (NRC, 2012) is a required text for the MAT program, and this text as well as the NGSS Performance Expectations guide the PD programs as well.\nResearchers working with Museum scientists and educators find it is not enough for programs for pre- and in-service teachers to provide access to resources. Research suggests that these programs need to engage pre- and in-service teachers in using and reflecting on these types of resources, as well as take into account school environments and support for pre- and in-service teachers with different levels of knowledge and teaching expertise. Evaluation findings from AMNH programs indicate pre- and in-service teachers deepen their science content knowledge and develop new ways of supporting inquiry-based learning and teaching.",

Close collaboration with national and international experts is an essential component in our process of developing practical, nationally consistent, and cost-effective measures to reduce potential vulnerabilities resulting from global changes. The next stage of USACE evaluation is to provide guidance on procedures to evaluate the magnitudes and effects of total water levels at USACE projects. The guidance will outline project specific analysis and assessment of total water level with respect to four primary mission areas: flood damage risk reduction, navigation, coastal storm damage risk reduction, and ecosystems. Federal agency and international sources of information and approaches will be outlined and provided. The various components of total water levels as well as temporal, geomorphic and regional variability will be assessed. A range of analysis level and methods will be outlined ranging from basic water level descriptive statistics to more complex analysis of hydrodynamic processes.

            "abstract": "Characterization of lava flow after its emplacement provides volume and constraints for lava flow emplacement simulations that help assess pending volcanic hazards. Additionally, it gives us better insights in understanding the dynamics of the underlying magmatic plumbing system and the possible mechanism of the eruption. In this work, we developed a technique using monostatic Cosmo-SkyMed and bistatic TanDEM-X data to calculate the volume, measure the thickness, and the horizontal and vertical displacements immediately after the emplacement of the October 2010 lava flow at Piton de la Fournaise. Results show that the thickest part of the October 2010 lava flow is about 13 to 16 m and the DRE volume is estimated to fall within the range of 1.71 to 3.00 x 106 m3 (±1σ), depending on which InSAR database was used. We also observe that the October 2010 lava flow is subsiding at a maximum rate of 14 cm yr-1. Apart from the vertical displacement, joint sliding and centripetal displacement were also identified with a maximum rate of 4.0 cm yr-1.\nWe cross-validated our InSAR results with the mixed-pixel technique of Harris [1997] in terms of the estimated volumes. Our analysis shows that the volume derived using a few TanDEM-X interferograms fitted well within the range of volume given by the mixed-pixel technique as compared to the huge monostatic Cosmo-SkyMed database.\nIn addition to the October 2010 lava flow, we also characterized the thin lava flow deposit of the December 2010 eruption, however using only bistatic TanDEM-X data. In this case of thin lava deposits, we expect that TanDEM-X are best to use in deriving the thickness and estimating the volume as these type of data are more sensitive to topographic change.\n",

The Paleozoic Bohemian Massif is a classical collisional orogen evolving through Andean type convergence and for which a modified view on the internal architecture of collisional orogens was recently proposed. The characteristic feature of the new model is the convergence of two contrasting lithospheric domains related to subduction of an attenuated felsic metaigneous crust under thehigh density metabasite dominated rifted (Gondwana) margin. The relamination of refractory light material rich in radioactive elements underneath the relatively dense upper plate is responsible for the gravitational instabilities that lead to the overturns in the thickened crust. Such a process results in the formation of a diffuse cryptic suture zone, i.e., a wide zone in which materials from the lower and upper plates are mixed to form a hybrid continental crust. The diffuse cryptic suture zone remains the only evidence of the original plate boundary repeatedly re-appearing within the orogen.",

The precise\nextent of the plasmasphere is dynamic, particularly during\ngeomagnetic active conditions. Knowing the exact distribution of\nplasma in the plasmasphere is important as an input to coupled\nmagnetospheric models. In particular, density gradients inside the\nplasmasphere and at the plasmapause, are important in controlling\nwaves which are responsible for the growth and decay of the radiation\nbelts. At the most basic level the plasmasphere can be described in\nterms of plasma exchange with the ionosphere and convection due to an\nimposed electric field. At that level plasmasphere modeling is\nrelatively simple. However there is currently insufficient knowledge\nof the drivers, particularly the electric field, to model the\nplasmasphere boundaries at the most accurate level to provide\nsufficient quality inputs to wave and radiation belt models.\nOne solution to this problem is to use a data assimilation\napproach. Data assimilation wraps a feedback loop around the\nplasmasphere model in which free, ideally unknown, model parameters\nare adjusted to maximize the agreement between the model and\nobservations. There are many possible implementations of this feedback\nloop. We use the Ensemble Kalman Filter in which a statistical\nensemble of models tracks the observations through linear\ntransformations. In previous work we have used either ground-based\nobservations from the PLASMON project (funded by the European Seventh\nFramework Program), or a small number of space-based observations. The\nnext step is to use a larger number of data sources, including a\nvariety of ground-based and space-based observations as well as other\nknowledge contains in empirical models.

            "abstract": "The volcanic island of Surtsey is the best-known product of a 3.5-year-long eruption that began in November 1963. During the course of the eruption four volcanic edifices grew from the seafloor along a discontinuous fissure extending 4.5 km, with three of them forming islands. Two of the islands washed quickly away – Syrtlingur lasted 5 months, and Jolnir 11 months. Surtla grew to within meters of the sea surface before its eruption ceased without forming an island. These separate eruptive centers along the Surtsey fissure produced edifices totalling ~0.15 km3 (Syrtlingur and Jolnir ~ 0.07 km3 each; Surtla ~0.01 km3), nearly half the volume of Surtsey below sea level (~0.3 km3). Although Surtsey's explosive activity ceased after 6 months, it was more than 3 years into the eruption when the last pyroclastic activity at Jolnir ceased, and during most of the time that Syrtlingur and Jolnir were erupting, there was no subaerial eruption at Surtsey. Here we present previously unpublished historic data on chemical diversity through the Surtsey eruption, bolstered with new analyses, and address specifically the other centers that were active during the eruption. Whole-rock compositions became progressively more magnesian as the eruption progressed (rising from 7 to 12% MgO), with a subtle concomitant reduction in potassium (0.7% to 0.4%). Glass compositions show considerable variation early in the eruption at Surtsey (~4.5-6.2 % MgO; 46.5-48.2% SiO2), but changed little through the remainder of the eruption (~7% MgO; 48% SiO2) at all sites. Glasses from Jolnir and Syrtlingur have overlapping compositions that form a separate cluster from those of Surtsey (more calcic, less potassic). Surtla, represented by only one sample and erupted at the greatest distance from Surtsey, has slightly more-evolved glass (lower MgO, higher FeOt), but this may reflect post-fragmentation crystal growth.

Slurries of sediment samples collected from two sites in southeastern Finland, i.e. from Lake Orivesi, Heposelkä, an vegetated littoral site, dominated by Phragmites australis (Sample Sa, sediment layer 0 – 25 cm) and from the profundal zone of a mesotrophic Lake Ätäskö (Aa, 0 – 10 cm; Ab, 10 – 30 cm; Ac, 90 - 130 cm), were incubated in laboratory in anaerobic conditions at in situ temperatures for up to 5 months. The samples were amended either 1) with 13CH4, 2) 13CH4 + manganese(IV) oxide (MnO2) or 3) 13CH4 + iron(III) hydroxide (Fe(OH)3), and the processes were measured by following the 13C transfer to the carbon dioxide (CO2) pool and by concentration measurements of CH4 and CO2. Changes in microbial communities were studied from DNA extracted from sediment samples before and after incubation period by next-generation sequencing (Ion Torrent) of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) - amplified bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA and methyl coenzyme-M reductase gene (mcrA) amplicons.\nAOM took place in every sample except in deepest sample (Ac) with potential rates up to 2.1 nmol CH4 d-1 g-1wetsedim (~2 nmol d-1 cm-3) which are considerably lower than previously reported metal-driven AOM in marine sediments (10-40 nmol d-1 cm-3) but within a range of NO3- -driven AOM in an oligotrophic lake (0.6-3.6 nmol d-1 cm-3). AOM took place without metal additions but addition of Mn4+ increased the potential rates and this increase was especially high in 10-30 cm layer (Ab) of the profundal site (5-fold increase). The structure of the bacterial and archaeal communities changed considerably during incubation. Communities incubated with Mn4+ were especially different from those incubated with Fe3+ or without metals which were more similar with each other. Surprisingly, anaerobic methanotrophic archaea detected, ANME-2D and AOM-associated archaea (AAA), were almost absent in the littoral site and constituted only up to 3.5% and 5% of archaeal 16S rRNA and mcrA gene sequences, respectively, in the profundal site. Mn4+ induced an increase in the abundance of ANME-2D and AAA in the profundal site which indicates that they are involved in Mn4+ - dependent AOM.",

            "abstract": "Rehabilitation efforts for the destruction of Typhoon Haiyan which ravaged the central part of the Philippines may take up to 10 years and will cost PhP 250 billion (USD 5.7 billion). To prevent extensive damages and extreme cost for rehabilitation, thorough risk assessment along with systematic infrastructure plans, evacuation plans, and land use planning of the areas must be done. The study conducted a qualitative risk assessment for the city of Tacloban, one of the severely affected areas by the storm surges brought about by the typhoon. Its coastal areas are at high risk to storm surge due to: its location relative to the typhoon track; low elevation topography; dense population; and progressive economic activities. The risk assessment model proposed by the United Nations (1991) was used, where the risk index is defined by the hazard index multiplied by its vulnerability index. The risk index was evaluated into a five-point scale: very high, high, medium, low, very low. The storm surge hazard index of the study area was derived from the simulation results of Typhoon Haiyan event using MIKE 21 – a versatile software used for coastal modelling. Simulations were made using the coupled approach of Hydrodynamic Flexible Mesh (HD FM) and Spectral Wave (SW) models. This approach takes into account both surge water levels and wave crest heights for overtopping of coastal structures. The vulnerability index was determined from population, built environment, and critical service centers. The resulting risk index map will be beneficial to the on-going rehabilitation efforts in the study area.",

            "abstract": "As an archipelagic country, the Philippines has experienced multiple storm surge threats. Moreover, the country's location, adjacent to the Pacific Ocean, results in an average of eight to nine typhoons that make landfall in a year. Storm surge hazard maps require high resolution topographic data to illustrate water inflow in the event of storm surges in vulnerable coastal areas and for accurate boundaries and coastline. Furthermore, potential hazard areas tend to be generalized in lower resolution data. The objective of this research is to compare three sources where accurate and quality storm surge hazard maps will draw bases from. For this purpose, the researcher used and compared SAR, IfSAR and LiDAR. The study involved comparing maps from different topographic data sources in Tacloban, in the province of Leyte. This area was one of the most heavily stricken areas during typhoon Haiyan where more than 6,000 people died and P34.37 billion worth of property was destroyed. In the comparison of the three sources, the following had be taken into consideration: cost of acquiring data, processing time, purpose, and the results. The research learned the following: Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR produces data with a 30 meter resolution, while Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (IfSAR) offers a resolution of 5 meters. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) has the highest resolution of the three with 1 meter. In addition, higher costs are paid for more detailed topographic data. Also, processing time takes longer for finer details due to the memory of the computer units used for modelling. The sources were also evaluated on the necessity of the scale at which the maps are needed for specific purposes such as practicality and direct disaster response. Results from the maps have been validated through interviews with the locals on the experience of actual storm surges. Through this study, the researcher concluded that although LiDAR can offer a more detailed and accurate topographic data, IfSAR is more strategic to use for immediate operational mapping. Because data from LiDAR takes a longer time to model due to the amount of detail, it is better used for long-term planning efforts, while IfSAR can substitute for immediate disaster response especially in local government units during typhoons.",

Many a times, especially in developing countries, the approaches deviate from this basic paradigm and results in ineffective management of the natural resources. This becomes more relevant in these countries which are witnessing heavy exodus of the rural population to urban areas increasing the pressures on the basic commodities. Spatial technologies which provide the opportunity to enhance the knowledge visualization of the policy makers and administrators which facilitates technical and scientific management of the resources. Increasing population has created negative impacts on the per capita availability of several resources, which has been well accepted in the statistical records of several developing countries. For instance, the per capita availability of water in India has decreased substantially in last decade and groundwater depletion is on the rise. There is hence a need of tool which helps in restoring the resource through visualization and evaluation temporally.\nGeological parameters play an important role in operation of several natural systems and earth sciences parameters may not be ignored. Spatial technologies enables application of 2D as well as 3D modeling taking into account variety of natural parameters related to diverse areas.\nThe paper presents case studies where spatial technology has helped in not only understanding the natural systems but also providing solutions, especially in Indian context.

            "abstract": "As marine research becomes increasingly multidisciplinary in its approach there has been a corresponding rise in the demand for large quantities of high quality interoperable data. A number of regional initiatives are already addressing this requirement through the establishment of e-infrastructures to improve the discovery and access of marine data. Projects such as Geo-Seas and SeaDataNet in Europe, Rolling Deck to Repository (R2R) in the USA and IMOS in Australia have implemented local infrastructures to facilitate the exchange of standardised marine datasets. However, each of these regional initiatives has been developed to address their own requirements and independently of other regions. To establish a common framework for marine data management on a global scale these is a need to develop interoperability solutions that can be implemented across these initiatives.\nThrough a series of workshops attended by the relevant domain specialists, the Ocean Data Interoperability Platform (ODIP) project has identified areas of commonality between the regional infrastructures and used these as the foundation for the development of three prototype interoperability solutions addressing:\nthe use of brokering services for the purposes of providing access to the data available in the regional data discovery and access services including via the GEOSS portal\nthe development of interoperability between cruise summary reporting systems in Europe, the USA and Australia for routine harvesting of cruise data for delivery via the Partnership for Observation of Global Oceans (POGO) portal\nthe establishment of a Sensor Observation Service (SOS) for selected sensors installed on vessels and in real-time monitoring systems using sensor web enablement (SWE)\nThese prototypes will be used to underpin the development of a common global approach to the management of marine data which can be promoted to the wider marine research community. ODIP is a community lead project that is currently focussed on regional initiatives in Europe, the USA and Australia but which is seeking to expand this framework to include other regional marine data infrastructures.",

            "abstract": "Climate information — in the form of a measure of climate state or a climate forecast — can be an important predictor of future hydrologic conditions. For instance, streamflow variability for many locations around the globe is related to large-scale atmospheric oscillations, like the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) or the Pacific/Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Furthermore, climate forecast models are growing more skillful in their predictions of future climate variables on seasonal time scales. Finding effective ways to translate this climate information into improved hydrometeorological predictions is an area of ongoing research. In ensemble streamflow forecasting, where historical weather inputs or streamflow observations are used to generate the ensemble, climate index weighting is one way to represent the influence of current climate information. Using a climate index, each forecast variable member of the ensemble is selectively weighted to reflect climate conditions at the time of the forecast.\nA simple Bayesian climate index weighting of ensemble forecasts is presented. The original hydrologic ensemble members define a sample of the prior distribution; the relationship between the climate index and the ensemble member forecast variable is used to estimate a likelihood function. Given an observation of the climate index at the time of the forecast, the estimated likelihood function is then used to assign weights to each ensemble member. The weighted ensemble forecast is then used to estimate the posterior distribution of the forecast variable conditioned on the climate index. The proposed approach has several advantages over traditional climate index weighting methods. The weights assigned to the ensemble members accomplish the updating of the (prior) ensemble forecast distribution based on Bayes’ Theorem, so the method is theoretically sound. The method also automatically adapts to the strength of the relationship between the climate index and the forecast variable, defaulting to equal weighting of ensemble members when no relationship exists. Furthermore, unlike more traditional climate index weighting methods, it does not require hindcast calibration to assign optimal weights, so it can be applied to existing ensemble forecasting system.",

On the other hand, socio-natural hazards have increased and diversified, in association with economic development. During 2010 and 2011, Colombia faced one of the most severe wet seasons in decades. One of the most significant impacts of this flood emergency was the demonstration of poor preparedness of communities, local authorities, and regional and national authorities to confront situations of large coverage. The emergencies occurred during 2010 and 2011, induced in association with a strong La Niña event, immediately demanded environmental and risk management authorities to provide communities with basic tools to understand the dynamics associated with excesses of rainfall and mitigate the possible impacts in their populations. For this reason, the Regional Autonomous Corporation of Central Antioquia, Colombia (CORANTIOQUIA) funded a project aimed to the design and conformation of a social network for early warnings of events associated to floods, torrential floods, and mass movements in 80 municipalities of the department of Antioquia, Colombia. For the execution of this project, the Corporation invited the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Antioquia. This talk aims to socialize this inititative that looked for integrating scientific and technical knowledge with popular knowledge in order to provide Latin American communities with tools to mitigate the possible impacts of global change.",

We apply the Matched Field Processing (MFP) seismic imaging technique to detect new seismic events using known discrete microearthquake sources. Events identified using MFP are typically smaller magnitude events or events that occur within the coda of a larger event. Additionally, we apply a Bayesian multiple-event seismic location algorithm, called MicroBayesLoc, to estimate the 95% probability ellipsoids for events with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR).

            "abstract": "Large-scale thermal forcing and freshwater fluxes play an essential role in setting the ocean’s temperature and salinity. The ratio of the relative contributions of haline and thermal forcing in the mixed layer is maintained by large-scale surface fluxes, leading to important consequences for mixing in the ocean interior. In a stratified ocean, mixing processes can be either isopycnal or diapycnal. The contribution of these processes to the total mixing rate in the ocean can be estimated from the large-scale forcing by evaluating the production of thermal variance, salinity variance and temperature-salinity covariance. A number of surface heat- and freshwater flux estimates are used to evaluate these terms and combine them to generate estimates of the production of density and spice variance. This variance production at the surface is used to estimate the relative importance of isopycnal and diapycnal mixing in the ocean. While isopycnal and diapycnal processes occur on very different length scales, we find that surface-driven production of density and spice variance requires an approximate equipartition between isopycnal and diapycnal mixing in the ocean interior. Here, dissipation estimates are produced using time-mean, monthly and daily flux estimates and surface variables, including Aquarius SSS and Optimum Interpolation SST to elucidate the importance of seasonal and daily forcing. While the inclusion of high-frequency variability increases the total dissipation required, it is likely that much of the resulting variance production is dissipated locally.",

Basic information on alpine plant distribution by elevation and substrate provides a basis for anticipating which species may decline in a warming climate. The Global Observation Research Initiative in Alpine Environments (GLORIA) is a worldwide effort to document vegetation changes over time in alpine settings using permanent multi-summit plots. The California/Nevada group currently monitors seven permanent GLORIA target regions, composed of 29 summits in alpine and subalpine zones. Summits range in elevations from 2918m to 4325m on substrates including dolomite, granite, quartzite, and volcanics. High-resolution plant occurrence and cover data from the upper 10 meters of each summit are presented. Plants from our target regions can be divided into three groups: summit specialists found only on the highest peaks, alpine species found predominantly within the alpine zone, and broadly distributed species found in the alpine zone and below. Rock substrate and microsite soil development have a strong influence on plant communities and species richness. We present the first set of five-year resurvey and temperature data from 18 summits. We have documented some annual variation in species presence/absence at almost all sites, but no dramatic changes in total diversity. Consistent with the expectation of rising global temperatures, our soil temperature loggers have documented temperature increases at most of our sites. These data are a baseline for assessing bioclimatic shifts and future plant composition in California and Nevada’s alpine zone.",

            "abstract": "Previous work (Li and Wettstein, 2012) has demonstrated that indices of two fundamental processes in the atmospheric general circulation (iT: thermal driving in the tropics and iE: momentum flux convergence in the midlatitudes) are associated both with simple reorganizations of storm track / jet covariability and with familiar leading patterns of climate variability in the Northern Hemisphere. North Atlantic zonal wind variability is mainly associated with eddy momentum flux convergence (NAO-like variability), whereas zonal wind variability over the Pacific is associated with both driving processes, providing evidence the North Pacific jet is both thermally-driven (PNA-like variability) and eddy-driven (WP-like). The present study uses both reanalysis and model simulations to expand on previous work by illustrating that the driving processes are associated with coherent three-dimensional zonal wind variability structures in both hemispheres, particularly in the vertical.\nZonal wind variability is analyzed on pressure surfaces chosen to emphasize one or the other of the thermal or eddy-driven processes. For example, the leading Northern Hemisphere pattern of extratropical zonal wind variability in the lower troposphere (850 hPa) is an NAO-like pattern of zonal wind variability that resides almost exclusively in the (eddy-driven) North Atlantic. Conversely, the leading Southern Hemisphere pattern of extratropical zonal wind variability near the tropopause (200 hPa) is a Pacific South America-like pattern of zonal wind variability that resides almost exclusively in the (thermally-driven) South Pacific. An eddy-driven Southern Annular Mode-like pattern of zonal wind variability concentrated in the South Indian Ocean is the second leading pattern of 200 hPa zonal wind variability in the Southern Hemisphere. Choosing different variables (e.g., geopotential height) and pressure levels for analysis will emphasize or distort relatively clear patterns of variability associated with iT and iE. The three-dimensional (and especially vertical) structure of zonal wind covariance associated with the leading patterns of climate variability corroborate these results.",

This instrument employs high resolution spectra measured in the Short-Wavelength InfraRed (SWIR) band to retrieve XCO2estimates.\nGOSAT XCO2 retrievals are nominally corrected for the contaminating backscatter influence of aerosols and thin clouds. However if the satellite-retrieved aerosol and thin cloud optical depths applied to the CO2 correction is biased then the correction and the retrieved CO2 values will be biased. We employed independent ground based estimates of both cloud screened and non cloud screened AOD (aerosol optical depth) in the CO2 SWIR channel and compared this with the GOSAT SWIR-channel OD retrievals to see if that bias was related to variations in the (generally negative) CO2 bias (ΔXCO2= XCO2(GOSAT) - XCO2(TCCON)).

This complements flume and field studies, stability analyses and parameter sensitivity studies using a batch of numerical simulations. With the presented approach researchers can -- similar to flume and field studies -- inspect and interact with the morphological evolution in real-time. Due to the numerical basis, the user can benefit from a number of additional features that aren't possible in physical studies, such as the ability to pause (and in the future rewind) the dynamics, and to look in detail at the numerics of the individual processes that cause the simulated behaviour while the system evolves.\nWe will demonstrate this interactive modelling approach based on the new Delft3D Flexible Mesh solver and a number of validation cases, and sketch our vision for applying this technique to larger more integrated models of rivers, estuaries and coastal regions.",

            "abstract": "Stochastic simulation of spatially distributed ground-motion time histories is important for performance-based earthquake design of geographically distributed systems. In this study, we develop a novel technique to stochastically simulate regionalized ground-motion time histories using wavelet packet analysis. First, a transient acceleration time history is characterized by wavelet-packet parameters proposed by Yamamoto and Baker (2013). The wavelet-packet parameters fully characterize ground-motion time histories in terms of energy content, time- frequency-domain characteristics and time-frequency nonstationarity. This study further investigates the spatial cross-correlations of wavelet-packet parameters based on geostatistical analysis of 1500 regionalized ground motion data from eight well-recorded earthquakes in California, Mexico, Japan and Taiwan. The linear model of coregionalization (LMC) is used to develop a permissible spatial cross-correlation model for each parameter group. The geostatistical analysis of ground-motion data from different regions reveals significant dependence of the LMC structure on regional site conditions, which can be characterized by the correlation range of Vs30 in each region. In general, the spatial correlation and cross-correlation of wavelet-packet parameters are stronger if the site condition is more homogeneous. Using the regional-specific spatial cross-correlation model and cokriging technique, wavelet packet parameters at unmeasured locations can be best estimated, and regionalized ground-motion time histories can be synthesized. Case studies and blind tests demonstrated that the simulated ground motions generally agree well with the actual recorded data, if the influence of regional-site conditions is considered. The developed method has great potential to be used in computational-based seismic analysis and loss estimation in a regional scale.",

            "abstract": "While climate modelling requires huge computational resources, initialising climate models using data assimilation is even more demanding. As the climate system is highly nonlinear both through nonlinear dynamics and strong feed backs the data-assimilation methodology has to be nonlinear too. Furthermore, it has been realised that one best forecast is not that useful and proper uncertainty quantification is essential for advances in the field. Both requirements point to fully nonlinear ensemble techniques, such as particle filters. Recently particle filters have been generated that allow for efficient ensemble members for climate model initialisation, by generating proper samples from the posterior probability density function in huge dimensional spaces.\nAnother issue is to connect the complex climate model to the data-assimilation code. We have developed a very efficient framework to do this using only MPI communication between separate model and data-assimilation executables, called EMPIRE. This framework allows for very fast connection of any complex model to state-of-the-art ensemble data-assimilation methods.\nWe will show an example of use of this new methodology to the HadCM3 climate model, which has over 2 million model variables, using the EMPIRE framework. We will discuss timings and efficiency, as well as some of the physical results. Finally, we will discuss the coupling with the very high resolution UM vn8.2 with close to 300 million model variables.",

            "abstract": "During all the stages of the seismic cycle, earthquakes, aseismic slip, or even the onset of locking on the fault, may produce geodetically measurable deformation at the surface of the Earth. For instance, we can use space geodetic observations to measure crustal deformation associated to aseismic behavior of faults, which is essential to increase our level of understanding of the kinematics and physical processes controlling earthquake and tsunami occurrence. Estimating subsurface processes, such as distribution of fault slip, from surface observations at the Earth’s crust is an inherently ill-posed problem. Therefore, the adopted inverse methodology to obtain such estimates plays a key role in this learning process. There are two general end member approaches to estimate the distribution of slip on a fault that deals with the inherent instability of the inverse problem: An unregularized, computationally expensive, fully Bayesian approach and a much more expedient but biased optimization approach using some form of regularized least squares. We focus our efforts in the latter approach. On the regularized inversion, the chosen form of regularization will introduce a priori information on fault slip estimates that needs to be well understood to be able to reach rigorous interpretation of the inversion results. We discuss the effects that the a priori information implied by commonly used regularization schemes has on slip estimates of fault behavior. Also we discuss the importance of using a regularization scheme that accounts for the spatial variability of the constraints provided by the observations (typically onland), in order to improve the stability and resolution of the inferred slip distributions of fault behavior. We present study cases in the Japan Trench and Central Andean subduction megathrusts. We also discuss the impact that off-shore geodetic monitoring has on our ability to provide insights on the mechanical behavior of the shallower portions of subduction megathrusts.",

            "abstract": "The evolution of enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) entails spatially and temporally evolving permeability fields. During non-isothermal fluid injection, thermo-elastic stress and fluid pressure changes act upon partially open or hydrothermally altered fracture sets to enhance formation permeability. The physical couplings that drive this behavior are non-linearly dependent upon one another to varying degrees. To explore these interactions we are developing a thermo-hydromechanical (THM) simulator capable of coupling the dominant physics of shear stimulation and allowing flexibility in the use of monolithic or staggered numerical schemes. Permeability is allowed to evolve under several constitutive models tailored to both porous media and fractures, considering the influence of thermo-hydromechanical stress, creep, and elasto-plastic shear and dilation in a ubiquitously fractured medium. From this basis we explore the coupled physical processes that control the evolution of permeability during shear stimulation and long-term evolution of a geothermal reservoir. Previous attempts to model the stimulation and sustainability of EGS are discussed in their relation to the current work and in an attempt to elucidate the dominant mechanisms of permeability alteration, including order-of-magnitude differences in permeability gain during hydraulic stimulation in isothermal versus non-isothermal simulations.",

            "abstract": "Cloud inhomogeneity is an important subject of physical parameterizations in in climate models. Subgrid-scale cloud variability can impact cloud microphysics, precipitation, and radiation. In the CESM, the subgrid-scale cloud liquid water concentration is represented by a gamma distribution function. The key shape parameter of the gamma distribution is fixed to an observation-based value. In reality, this shape parameter should depend on model grid scale and other atmosphere conditions. The objective of this study is to estimate and parameterize the shape parameter suitable for different model resolutions. Cloud measurements from the Atmospheric Measurement Program (ARM) are used. These include the ground-based long-term liquid water content data from Continuous Baseline Microphysical Retrieval (MICROBASE) product and Best Estimate Data Products. Larger grid scale and more unstable atmosphere are found to increase inhomogeneity and therefore have smaller shape parameter.\nA scale-dependent parameterization of the shape parameter is presented based on the above observation information. When it is implemented in the CESM, spatially and temporally varying shape parameters are simulated with larger values in high latitudes and smaller values in low latitudes. Single column model and general circulation model (GCM) sensitivity experiments are conducted to understand the effects of varying shape parameter on climate simulations. Compared with fixed shape parameter setting, varying shape parameter simulation tends to increase liquid water path in polar regions and decrease liquid water path in low latitudes. The proposed parameterization can be used for all spatial resolutions of the CESM without special tuning of the shape parameter.",

Instances were observed during the recent CONTRAST exploration of tropical Pacific marine dynamics and composition. The lack of correlation between sampled carbon monoxide and ozone is consistent with an oceanic source of CO. Carbon monoxide vertical flux will be estimated for all CONTRAST boundary layer transects, with particular focus on these events. Complementary correlative observations of trace organics lend insight into processes defining this composition. The frequency of occurrence will be presented along with comparison to similar observations within other data sets, including TORERO (2012), and HIPPO (2009-2012).",

            "abstract": "Improvements to TC/hurricane intensity forecasts may depend on routine spatially-dense measurements of thermodynamic temperature/water vapor profiles, sea surface winds, clouds and precipitation. Both high vertical resolution (~10-100 meters) within the air-sea boundary layer, and high horizontal resolution (~1-10 km) are needed, with particular emphasis on the eyewall and rainband regions. Such observations cannot be obtained from satellites, but require airborne assets with appropriate instrumentation. We describe a suite of research quality instruments for hurricane reconnaissance from the NASA WB-57F aircraft platform. The High Definition Sounding System automatically deploys up to 90 XDD dropsondes for simultaneous high resolution PTU+Winds vertical profiles and SST, while an array of active and passive remote sensing instruments map thermodynamic and cloud/precipitation variables. The XDD is a lightweight GPS dropsonde providing thermodynamic curtain in-situ measurements as densely as km-scale spacing. The airborne profiling radiometers include water vapor, temperature, cloud, precipitation, and ocean surface wind imaging. These instruments use both staring and conical scanning polarimetric radiometry techniques. Of specific interest will be dense boundary layer profiling and upper atmospheric humidity, which historically have been very challenging measurements. A unique 183 GHz radiometer will provide calibration closure for polymer-based humidity sensors used by all dropsondes. Polymer sensors are well known to suffer from a so-called \"dry bias\" calibration error. The poster will describe the collective capabilities of this new observational platform and show data from past deployments on a variety of NASA and Navy research aircraft.",

            "abstract": "Cratonic eclogites are samples of lithospheric mantle preserved beneath ancient continental cratons. Hence, the origin of cratonic eclogites is closely related to the formation and evolution of cratonic mantle. Here we report Mg isotopic compositions for 27 cratonic eclogites and 52 garnet and clinopyroxene mineral separates from Koidu, Bellsbank and Kaalvallei kimberlite pipes in South and West Africa. Whole-rock Mg isotopic compositions vary widely, with δ26Mg ranging from -1.60 to +0.17, significantly different from the value (δ26Mg = -0.25 ± 0.07) of peridotite xenoliths. Garnet and clinopyroxene in these cratonic eclogites record equilibrium inter-mineral Mg isotope partitioning at mantle temperatures, with Δ26MgCpx-Grt (= δ26MgCpx - δ26MgGrt) in the range of 0.43 – 0.85 ‰. The constructed bulk δ26Mg values based on mineral compositions are identical to the measured whole-rock values, indicating limited influence of kimberlite infiltration on Mg isotopic compositions of cratonic eclogites. As significant Mg isotope fractionation can only occur during low-temperature surface processes, the large Mg isotopic variations of cratonic eclogites suggest the incorporation of subducted materials in their protoliths. Therefore, our Mg isotopic data suggest the cratonic eclogites are the remnants of subducted oceanic crust within the lithospheric mantle. Collectively, Mg isotopes are potentially excellent tracers of the formation and evolution of sub-continental lithospheric mantle.",

            "abstract": "The evolution of large scale hydrothermal systems entails spatially and temporally evolving permeability fields. During hydrothermal circulation, thermo-elastic stress and fluid pressure changes act upon partially open or hydrothermally altered fracture sets to modify permeability within the system, thereby shifting the patterns of circulation. To explore these interactions we are developing a thermo-hydromechanical (THM) simulator capable of coupling the dominant physics of the hydrothermal system and allowing flexibility in the use of monolithic or staggered numerical schemes. Permeability is allowed to evolve under several constitutive models tailored to both porous media and fractures, considering the influence of thermo-hydromechanical stress, creep, and elasto-plastic shear and dilation in a ubiquitously fractured medium. To expand our understanding of the long-term evolution of these systems, simulations incorporate information gleaned from the modeling of magmatic processes in the lower crust, where characteristics of the heat source are crucial in defining hydrothermal evolution. Results of a stochastic dike intrusion model are fed into the hydrothermal simulator to explore sensitivity relative to characteristics of the magmatic source. This is a first step to examining feedback mechanisms between heat transfer within geothermal fields and heat supply from the lower crust in a rigorous manner. We compare several simulations that elucidate the relative importance of magma intrusion rate and spatial distribution on overall heat transfer characteristics.",

            "abstract": "The distribution of long-chain (C37 – C39) alkenones in marine sediment has been well documented to record paleo-sea surface temperatures. The alkenones were also found in sediments of terrestrial saline lakes, and recently the calibrations of alkenone unsaturation indices - temperature have been established in continental areas. Furthermore, these biomarkers have been identified in lacustrine sediments on high-latitudinal terrestrial areas such as Greenland and Antarctica. In the present study, the alkenones were identified in the lacustrine sediment cores in freshwater (Lake Naga-ike) and saline lakes (Lake Suribati and Lake Funazoko) on the Skarvsnes, and a saline lake (Lake Skallen Oh-ike) on the Skallen, Antarctica. Here, we report that the alkenone distribution in the Antarctic lakes was examined as paleotemperature proxy.\nC37-C38 Tetra- and tri-unsaturated alkenones and C37 tetra- and tri-unsaturated alkenoates are identified in all sediment samples. The C37 di-unsaturated (C37:2) alkenones can be identified in sediments of surface layers (0-15 cm) of Lake Naga-ike and layers of 160-190 cm depth, in which age is ca. 3000 years BP by 14C dating, in Lake Skallen Ohike, and alkenone unsaturation index (UK37) is analyzed from these sediments. By using a calibration obtained from a culture strain Chrysotila lamellosa as reported by Nakamura et al. (2014), paleotemperatures are calculated to be 9.2-15ºC in surface sediments of Lake Naga-ike and 6.8-8.6ºC in Lake Skallen Oh-ike, respectively. The estimated temperatures are concordant with summer temperature of lake waters observed in Lake Naga-ike. Also, the highest concentrations of the alkenones and alkenoates are observed in deeper (older) sediment layers from Lake Naga-ikes, which has not been connected the ocean and intruded sea water. This implies that the alkenones are originated from indigenous biological organism(s) in Antarctic lake water. The class distributions (unsaturation ratios) of alkenones varied with core depths in Lake Naga-ike and Lake Suribati, whereas these are nearly constant with core depths in Lake Funazoko. These variations presumably depended on changes of climatic and environmental conditions in lake water. Thus, it is suggested that the alkenone proxies can be applicable for Antarctic climate changes.",

            "abstract": "Tropical cyclones (TCs) accompanied with heavy rainfall and strong wind are high impact weather systems, often causing extensive property damage and even fatalities when landed. Better prediction of TCs can lead to substantial reduction of social and economic damage; there are growing interests in the enhanced satellite data assimilation for improving TC forecasts. Accurate cloud detection is one of the most important factors in satellite data assimilation due to the uncertainties of cloud properties and their impacts on satellite observed radiances. To enhance the accuracy of cloud detection and improve the TC forecasting, microwave measurements are collocated with high spatial resolution imager cloud mask. The collocated advanced microwave sounder measurements are assimilated for the hurricane Sandy (2012) and typhoon Haiyan (2013) forecasting using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and the 3DVAR-based Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) data assimilation system. Experiments will be carried out to determine a cloud cover threshold to distinguish between cloud affected and cloud unaffected footprints. The results indicate that the use of the high spatial resolution imager cloud mask can improve the accuracy of TC forecasts by eliminating cloud contaminated pixels. The methodology used in this study is applicable to advanced microwave sounders and high spatial resolution imagers, such as ATMS/VIIRS onboard NPP and JPSS, and IASI/AVHRR from Metop, for the improved TC track and intensity forecasts.",

            "abstract": "The Bengal Delta region in South Asia is well-known for its endemicity to diarrheal diseases and high population vulnerability to natural calamities and diarrheal and other water-related disease epidemics. The diarrheal disease outbreaks in the coastal and inland floodplains, such as cholera, rotavirus, and dysentery, show distinct seasonal peaks and spatial signatures in their origin and progression. The last three decades of surveillance data also shows a drastic increase of diarrheal incidence in both urban and peri-urban areas, even after correcting for population trends. Recent research has shown increased roles of hydroclimatic events such as droughts and floods on the seasonal to interannual characteristics, as well as the coastal and inland progression patterns of disease outbreaks. However, the mechanisms behind these phenomena, especially how the changes in the regional climatic and hydrologic processes contributed to the spatio-temporal trends of disease outbreaks are not fully understood.\nHere, we analyze the last 30-years of diarrheal incidence in Dhaka and regional surveillance centers with changes in climatic or anthropogenic forcings: regional hydrology, flooding, water usage, population growth and density in urban settlements, as well as shifting climate patterns and frequency of natural disasters. We use a set of CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) model projections of regional precipitation and temperature patterns in Bengal Delta to develop scenarios of diarrheal disease projections with spatial (coastal and inland) and temporal (dry vs wet) comparisons. Our preliminary results shows that growing water scarcity in the dry season, increasing salinity in coastal areas, and lack of sustainable water and sanitation infrastructure for urban settlements have increased endemicity of cholera outbreaks in spring, while record flood events, limited stormwater drainage and sanitation, and more intensive monsoon has contributed to increased epidemic outbreaks. However, a number of future projections suggest that spring will be drier and fall will be wetter in upcoming years especially in the southwestern parts of the Bengal delta, which eventually will make the inhabitants more vulnerable to diarrheal outbreaks.",

            "abstract": "Because of its ability to intercept a portion of rainfall, vegetated canopy has a significant influence on the urban hydrological cycle. In turn, urban watersheds, characterized by large impervious areas, have an enormous and often adverse impact on receiving waters. However, most historical interception research has been dedicated to forest canopies. The goal of our research was to quantify rainfall partitioning by isolated evergreen canopies in an urban setting.\nTwo years of the field experiment involved three exemplars of Cherry Laurel (Prunus laurocerasus'Otto Luyken'.) Each plant had ten rain gauges to measure throughfall with a five second sampling frequency. A number of preventive techniques were introduced to minimize the gauges' errors (e.g., splash-in, splash-out and excessive wetting.) Leaf area index was measured manually. We estimated the canopy storage capacity to be less than 0.5 mm. An on-site automated weather station provided meteorological data.\nCumulative interception loss for the periods of August-December 2013 and April-July 2014 was 51%. Phenological change did not show a stable pattern of influence on throughfall depths. Measurements in May and July 2014 showed a high variability of stemflow (2-16%) between rain events.\nThroughfall and precipitation intensities (mm/hr) expressed strong linear relationships (adjusted coefficient of determination R20.79) for the entire range of observed rainfall intensities. The ratio of throughfall to precipitation intensity was 0.49:1. The observations suggest that reduction of throughfall intensity by the canopy during a rainstorm determines the bulk of interception depth. In contrast, the amount of water stored on the canopy and evaporated between and after rain events contributes minimally to interception.\nSimulations of potential evaporation based on the Penman-Monteith method revealed a serious underestimation of evaporation from the wet canopy surfaces during the rain events. Mechanisms other than heat balance models of potential evaporation from a still water surface are being discussed in order to explain large intrastorm evaporation from within an isolated canopy.",

Through researching the area the structure ,the deposition carries on the analysis and responds the characteristic analysis simulation in the rock physics analysis and the seismic in the foundation, and then the reflected seismic data carried by tectonic analysis processing and the AVO characteristic analysis processing reveal that the research area existence natural gas hydrate (already by drilling confirmation) and the natural gas hydrate distribution and the structure relations is extremely close. In the structure development area, the fault and the crevasse crack growing, the natural gas hydrate distribution characteristic is obvious (this is also confirmed the storing space of natural gas hydrate in this area is mainly crevasse crack). This conclusion also agree with the actual drilling result.\nThe research prove that the distribution of natural gas hydrate in this area is mainly controlled by structure control.

            "abstract": "Earth is an isolated, cooling planet that obeys the 2nd law. Interior dynamics is driven from the top, by cold sinking slabs. High-resolution broad-band seismology and geodesy has confirmed that mantle flow is characterized by narrow downwellings and ~20 broad slowly rising updrafts. The low-velocity zone (LVZ) consists of a hot melange of sheared peridotite intruded with aligned melt-rich lamellae that are tapped by intraplate volcanoes. The high temperature is a simple consequence of the thermal overshoot common in large bodies of convecting fluids. The transition zone consists of ancient eclogite layers that are displaced upwards by slabs to become broad passive, and cool, ridge feeding updrafts of ambient mantle. The physics that is overlooked in canonical models of mantle dynamics and geochemistry includes; the 2nd law, convective overshoots, subadiabaticity, wave-melt interactions, Archimedes’ principle, and kinetics (rapid transitions allow stress-waves to interact with melting and phase changes, creating LVZs; sluggish transitions in cold slabs keep eclogite in the TZ where it warms up by extracting heat from mantle below 650 km, creating the appearance of slab penetration). Canonical chemical geodynamic models are the exact opposite of physics and thermodynamic based models and of the real Earth. A model that results from inverting the assumptions regarding initial and boundary conditions (hot origin, secular cooling, no external power sources, cooling internal boundaries, broad passive upwellings, adiabaticity and whole-mantle convection not imposed, layering and self-organization allowed) results in a thick refractory-yet-fertile surface layer, with ancient xenoliths and cratons at the top and a hot overshoot at the base, and a thin mobile D” layer that is an unlikely plume generation zone. Accounting for the physics that is overlooked, or violated (2nd law), in canonical models, plus modern seismology, undermines the assumptions and conclusions of these models.",

            "abstract": "The GRACE mission uses two spacecraft in near identical Earth orbits with a phase sensitive microwave ranging instrument that measures changes in spacecraft separation. High precision measurements of the spacecraft separation yield monthly Earth gravity field measurements. The GRACE FO mission adds the Laser Ranging Instrument (LRI) to demonstrate high resolution spacecraft separation measurements with phase-sensitive detection of a frequency-stabilized laser transponder. Previous studies show the improvements in mass change detection afforded by the higher sensitivity range change measurements.\nThe sparse spatial/temporal sampling and single gravity field component detection of a polar orbiting satellite pair leads to aliasing and artifacts in the gravity field data. These effects limit the mass change detection capability of a GRACE-like mission. Adding a second pair of satellites improves overall system performance by filling in data gaps and sampling the gravity field in different directions. The added expense of a second satellite pair has made this option for improved performance untenable.\nA SmallSat GRACE-like mission addresses the cost concern for a multi-pair mission by reducing spacecraft expense and making common launch possible. Through use of a laser ranging sensor and other low-power subsystems and use of existing smallsat architectures, a complete spacecraft-instrument system is shown to meet measurement requirements and make the overall system expense comparable to existing single-pair missions. The resulting multi-pair space segment approach offers a viable option for a GRACE-like mission while improving the science through its better sampling of the gravity field. We show the system concept and simulated gravity field retrievals based on estimates of instrument and spacecraft performance.",

These ubiquitous magnetic structures differ in appearance and apparent dynamics depending upon position on the sun relative to the observer and upon observational wavelength.

            "abstract": "The projected impacts of climate change in the coastal zone will require local planning and local resources to adapt to increasing risks of social, environmental, and economic consequences from extreme events. This means that, for the first time in human history, aggregated local demands could outpace global supply of certain “climate-critical resources.” For example, construction materials such as sand and gravel, steel, and cement may be needed to fortify many coastal locations at roughly the same point in time if decision makers begin to construct new storm barriers or elevate coastal lands. Where might adaptation bottlenecks occur? Can the world produce enough cement to armour the world’s seaports as flood risks increase due to sea-level rise and more intense storms? Just how many coastal engineers would multiple such projects require? Understanding such global implications of adaptation requires global datasets—such as bathymetry, coastal topography, local sea-level rise and storm surge projections, and construction resource production capacity—that are currently unavailable at a resolution appropriate for a global-scale analysis. Our research group has identified numerous gaps in available data necessary to make such estimates on both the supply and demand sides of this equation. This presentation examines the emerging need and current availability of these types of datasets and argues for new coordinated efforts to develop and share such data.",

            "abstract": "The Najinhe watershed is a topographically diverse, heavily agricultural watershed in northeastern China that provides opportunities for identification of the impact of land use on nitrogen cycling. In addition to agricultural soil amendments, seasonal variation in atmospheric flow introduces a signal of dry and wet deposition from urban and desert atmospheric N sources. Both agricultural amendments and atmospheric sources are significant sources of reactive N, at estimated annual rates of 450kg/hectare and 30kg/hectare respectively in the nearby North China Plain.\nLand use, both historic and current, influences the biological processing of nitrogen in a particular area. Soil conditions, including moisture, texture, and organic content, control the capacity of a parcel for processing reactive nitrogen. Compounds derived from natural and anthropogenic sources exhibit characteristic ratios of stable isotopes of nitrogen and oxygen that serve as tracers of origin as well as integrators of biological processes. Analysis of bulk soils (including both organic and inorganic N) in the system shows δ15N ranging from 1.3 – 8.6 ‰ suggesting varying influence of anthropogenic fertilizers, soil organic nitrogen, and atmospheric sources based on land use.\nA distributed hydrologic model coupled with one focusing on reactive transport is able to help determine locations with the highest impact on the dissolved N in this system. Spatial statistical methods are employed to determine the biogeochemical influence of model locations whereas δ18O and δ15N measurements from NO3- and NH4+ in surface water and soil extracts are used to calibrate and validate model predictions based on measured precipitation and streamflow values. Sources are integrated using a Bayesian mixing model to determine likely fate and transport parameters for various N inputs to the watershed.\nThe application of the coupled hydrologic and transport models to a village scale catchment suggests integration and expansion to larger watersheds on the basin scale. Identification of sensitive parcels on multiple spatial scales can direct targeted land management efforts to mitigate ecological and health effects of reactive N in surface waters.",

The middle schools are located in the Metro Boston area. As part of the program, participating students were asked to draw pictures of their perceptions and ideas on global change. The drawings of 150 children, ages 11 to 13, were qualitatively analyzed. The analysis focused on (a) the type of concepts children chose to convey, (b) the specific context of the global change described (polar bears in floating glaciers), (c) students direct representation of anthropocentric impacts (such as pollution or deforestation), and (d) the match between students concepts and the recent IPCC reports. About 20% of the students focused on the iconic imagery of the melting glaciers and impact on animals such as penguins and polar bears, more than 25% focused on natural disasters (such as storms, sea level changes) while 30% focused on urban problems. These concepts are matched with the recent IPCC report. These results are notable and suggest students in middle schools understand the varied dimensions of global change and the role of human activities in bringing about change. Students’ perspectives may help in developing a suitable curriculum using existing science standards to discuss this significant topic in middle school classrooms. In addition, students’ drawings illustrate their perception of the coupled human and natural systems.",

            "abstract": "The height of the tropopause, which divided the stratosphere and the troposphere, is a result of two rival categories of processes: the tropospheric vertical convection and the radiative heating of the stratosphere resulting from the ozone cycle. Hence, it is natural that tropospheric and stratospheric phenomena can have effect each other in manifold processes of stratosphere-troposphere interactions. In the present study we focus our attention to the \"top-down\" side of the interaction: the impact of stratospheric ozone distribution on the features of tropospheric circulation and the associated weather patterns and regional climate conditions.\nWe proceed from analyzes of the observational data performed at the A.I. Voeikov Main Geophysical Observatory, which suggest a distinct correlation between stratospheric ozone distribution, synoptic formations and air-masses boundaries in the upper troposphere and the temperature field of the lower stratosphere [1]. Furthermore, we analyze local features of atmospheric general circulation and stratospheric ozone distribution from the atmospheric reanalyses and general circulation model data, focusing our attention to instantaneous positions of subtropical and polar stationary atmospheric fronts, which define regional characteristics of the general circulation cells in the troposphere and separate global tropospheric air-masses, correspond to distinct meteorological regimes in the TOC field [2, 3].\nWe assume that by altering the tropopause height, stratospheric ozone-related processes can have an impact on the location of the stationary atmospheric fronts, thereby exerting influence on circulation processes in troposphere and lower stratosphere. For midlatitudes, the tropopause height controls the position of the polar stationary front, which has a direct impact on the trajectory of motion of active vortices on synoptic tropospheric levels, thereby controlling weather patterns in that region and the regional climate. This mechanism is particularly important for the formation of blocking events.\n[1] A.M.

            "abstract": "Highly branched isoprenoid (HBI) alkanes and thiophenes are diagenetic derivatives of HBI alkenes produced by certain groups of diatoms, especially Rhizosolenid and Naviculoid diatoms. The occurrence of C25 HBIs in geological samples has been recognized from the Upper Turonian (89.5 Ma), which regarded to indicate the appearance of rhizosolenid diatom. In the present study, we performed biomarker analysis of the Late Cretaceous marine sediments from the Yezo Group, Hokkaido, Japan, to elucidate the timing of rhizosolenid diatom expansion. Furthermore, subsequent variations in the HBI concentration are expected to reflect the variation in siliceous primary production to an extent, which have hardly been described in the northwest Pacific region due to poor preservation of diatoms.\nThe mudstones of Saku Formation and Haborogawa Foramtion, Yezo Group, were sampled in the Kotanbetsu area, Hokkaido, Japan. The Cretaceous Yezo Group is one of the few strata that record Cretaceous paleoceanographic changes in the northwest Pacific, and the integrated bio- and carbon isotope stratigraphy have been well established in the studied section.\nThe first occurrence of C25 HBIs was recorded from the late Turonian mudstone samples from the horizon close to the Hitch Wood Event as suggested by the integrated bio- and carbon isotope stratigraphy. Preceding the Turonian/Coniacian boundary (Navigation Event), Hitch Wood Event dates almost comparable to the previous earliest HBI record from the equatorial Atlantic, suggesting the concurrent rise of rhizosolenid diatom production in the Pacific Ocean. The HBI concentrations subsequently increase toward the Turonian/Coniacian boundary and significantly rise during the mid- to late Santonian. These results implies rising importance of rhizosolenid diatoms in the marine production in this region, possibly associated with contemporaneous global cooling trends documented by multiple temperature records during those periods.",

            "abstract": "The lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MCM) are the only perennially ice covered lakes on Earth and are the primary refuge for life in this hyper-arid polar desert. As a result of the ice cover and an uncoupled day/night cycle, the physical and biogeochemical processes in the lakes are highly unusual, with biogeochemical gradients and concentrations of specific compounds often exceeding those found in other aquatic ecosystems on Earth. These lakes are ideal systems for the study of redox-sensitive biogeochemical processes, model systems for understanding the effects of global climate change on polar ecosystems, end-member systems that provide insight into biogeochemical and limnological dynamics in meromictic lakes, analogues for life on other planets, and perfect systems to study microbial life at its thermodynamic limits. Lake Vanda, in the Wright valley, is relatively deep (73 m), hypersaline and has anoxic bottom water. High concentrations of chacotrophic salts results in low water activities that exert further challenges on microbial life. We collected details geochemical profiles of nutrients, major ions, dissolved gases, and redox metabolites and measured rates of microbially-mediated processes that cycle carbon, nitrogen and sulfur in the lakes waters and sediments. Despite the harsh and extreme nature of Lake Vanda and the thermodynamic barriers to microbially-mediated geochemical reactions, microorganisms are not only present in the lake but they mediate a diverse suite of geochemical processes. Statistical correlations between geochemical parameters, microbial activity and microbial community composition shed light on the factors that regulate and limit microbial activity in this unique extreme environment.",

This study gives the long-term variation characteristics of atmospheric aerosol optical depth at 14 first-class solar radiation stations in China during 1993-2012. Based on the broadband extinction method (BEM), we retrieve the AOD from the hourly accumulated direct solar radiation. Using a AOD selection method, we derive and analyze the monthly, seasonal and annual averaged AOD. The results show that (1) the mean AOD ranges from 0.135 (Lhasa) to 0.678 (Zhengzhou). Shenyang has the maximum standard deviation of 0.109, while Ejin Banner has the minimum value of 0.021. The mean value for all years and stations is 0.423. (2) At most stations, the largest AOD appears in spring and the smallest in autumn. The seasonal averaged AOD of all years and stations is 0.487 (spring), 0.456 (summer), 0.364 (autumn) and 0.381 (winter). (3) As to the variation trend, an increasing trend appeared at five stations (Kashi, Kunming, Zhengzhou, Wuhan and Shanghai), while a decreasing trend is found at two stations (Guangzhou and Beijing). After analyzing the correlations between AOD and the meteorological factors (i.e. temperature, pressure, humidity and visibility), we find that AOD has a positive correlation with temperature, and a negative correlation with pressure and visibility at most of the stations.",

            "abstract": "Phases of the convective lifecycle are thought to be associated with variations in the vertical structure of convection. Vertical motion often has a more bottom-heavy profile during growth phases and a more top-heavy profile during decaying phases. During the growth phase of tropical deep convection, the moisture (and moist static energy, MSE) convergence associated with the convection is typically larger than the precipitation, leading to moistening and further enhancements in deep convection. Conversely, during the decaying phase of deep convection, precipitation is usually larger than moisture (and MSE) convergence and hence the atmosphere dries and is less conducive to deep convection. We examine the hypothesis that the variations in vertical motion structure lead to charging and discharging of moist static energy during convective life-cycles.\nWe also use observations from the TOGA COARE field campaign to test the relative importance of various processes in the growth and decay of moist static energy anomalies. Vertical advection (convergence), horizontal advection, reductions in radiative cooling and increases in evaporation can all play a role. Using filtering and a moist static energy budget analysis, we find that on shorter timescales, variations in vertical structure (and associated vertical advection) are more important to the moist static energy budget than on longer timescales.",

However, environments within cave entrances are expected to respond most quickly to changing surface conditions. We cataloged a relict assemblage of at least 10 endemic arthropods likely restricted to caves and occurring primarily within cave entranceways. Of these animals, eight were considered new undescribed species. These endemic arthropods have persisted in Rapa Nui (Easter Island) caves despite a catastrophic ecological shift induced by island-wide deforestation, fire intolerance, and drought, as well as intensive livestock grazing and surface ecosystems dominated by invasive species. We consider these animals to be “disturbance relicts” – species whose distributions are now limited to areas that experienced minimal human disturbance historically. Today, these species represent one-third of the Rapa Nui’s known endemic arthropods. Given the island’s severely depauperate native fauna, these arthropods should be considered among the highest priority targets for biological conservation. In other regions globally, epigean examples of imperiled disturbance relicts persisting within narrow distributional ranges have been documented. As human activity intensifies, and habitat loss and fragmentation continues worldwide, additional disturbance relicts will be identified. We expect extinction debts, global climate change and interactions with invasive species will challenge the persistence of both hypogean and epigean disturbance relict species.",

The model captures the well-known increase in charge state ratios C+6/ C+5 and O+7/O+6 in the slow wind, inline with Ulysses observations. We present a theoretical picture explaining the formation of these increases, which are related to regions of higher electron density and temperature near the boundaries of coronal holes. We verify the existence of these regions using a 3D tomographic reconstruction of the lower corona. This work establishes that a steady slow wind flowing along open magnetic field lines can carry high charge states without invoking reconnection with closed field regions. This subset of slow wind can play a role explaining the properties of the non-steady slow wind, and complement dynamic models of slow solar wind formation.",

            "abstract": "Active tectonics of a deformation front constrains the kinematic evolution and structural interaction between the fold-thrust belt and most-recently accreted foreland basin. In Kashmir, the Himalayan Frontal thrust (HFT) is blind, characterized by a broad fold, the Suruin-Mastargh anticline (SMA), and displays no emergent faults cutting either limb. A lack of knowledge of the rate of shortening and structural framework of the SMA hampers quantifying the earthquake potential for the deformation front. Our study utilized the geomorphic expression of dated deformed terraces on the Ujh River in Kashmir. Six terraces are recognized, and three yield OSL ages of 53 ka, 33 ka, and 0.4 ka. Vector fold restoration of long terrace profiles indicates a deformation pattern characterized by regional uplift across the anticlinal axis and back-limb, and by fold limb rotation on the forelimb. Differential uplift across the fold trace suggests localized deformation. Dip data and stratigraphic thicknesses suggest that a duplex structure is emplaced at depth along the basal décollement, folding the overlying roof thrust and Siwalik-Muree strata into a detachment-like fold. Localized faulting at the fold axis explains the asymmetrical fold geometry. Folding of the oldest dated terrace, suggest that rock uplift rates across the SMA range between 2.0-1.8 mm/yr. Assuming a 25° dipping ramp for the blind structure on the basis of dip data constraints, the shortening rate across the SMA ranges between 4.4-3.8 mm/yr since ~53 ka. Of that rate, ~1 mm/yr is likely absorbed by minor faulting in the near field of the fold axis. Given that Himalaya-India convergence is ~18.8-11 mm/yr, internal faults north of the deformation front, such as the Riasi thrust absorbs more of the Himalayan shortening than does the HFT in Kashmir. We attribute a non-emergent thrust at the deformation front to reflect deformation controlled by pre-existing basin architecture in Kashmir, in which the thick succession of foreland strata Murree-Siwalik (8-9 km) overlie a deepened basal décollement. Blind thrusting reflects some combination of layer-parallel shortening, high stratigraphic overburden, relative youth of the HFT, and/or sustained low shortening rate on 10^5 yrs to longer timescales.",

            "abstract": "The unique setting and high-resolution stratigraphy at Squaw Lakes, Oregon provides an opportunity to apply lake paleoseismology to southern Cascadia forearc lakes. These lakes were formed when a landslide dammed Squaw Creek located ~100 km from the Oregon coast at the Oregon/California border separating the drainages at the confluence of Squaw and Slickear Creeks. The upper lake contains evidence of disturbance events much too frequent to be the result of earthquakes alone. A link to historic events provides information that may be used to differentiate between deposit triggers and improve the interpretation of the prehistoric portion of the sedimentary record.\nRegional newspapers published historic accounts of earthquakes experienced by the local people, the most notable of which is the November 23 (or 22nd), 1873 Crescent City, CA earthquake. Although the 1906 San Francisco earthquake was also felt in this region, reports indicate that shaking was much stronger near Jacksonville, Oregon (only 25 miles to the north of Squaw Lakes) as a result of the 1873 earthquake. The depth range that most likely contains sediment deposited within a few years of 1873 can be determined using a new high-resolution age model for the Upper Squaw Lake sediment core (Gavin et al., in prep). This depth range in the core contains a thick deposit that is similar in structure to deposits deeper in the core that have been proposed to correlate with the marine record of Cascadia great earthquakes. These disturbance event deposits are thicker, graded deposits, where grading is dominated by the percentage of organic content as compared to those interpreted to be a result of watershed disturbances. Recently acquired radiocarbon ages for the Lower Squaw Lake core suggests the thicker Upper Squaw Lake deposits correlate to those recorded in the lower-resolution sedimentary record at Lower Squaw Lake. The character of the likely contemporaneous deposits from the lower lake show grading more typical of seismogenic turbidites. These observations provide additional evidence that can be used to identify seismogenic deposits in these cores.",

            "abstract": "Orthopyroxenes are common rock forming minerals that are present on many planetary bodies as well as meteorites and cosmic dust. The presence of these minerals can give implications to the petrogenic history of these planetary bodies. Optical constants, n and k, are essential inputs into radiative transfer models which are used in remote sensing techniques. [1,2] While optical constants have been determined for orthopyroxenes with high Mg content, Fe rich orthopyroxenes have not been studied as extensively. [3] The goal of this research is to determine the optical constants of orthopyroxenes ranging in composition along the enstatite-ferrosilite solid solution, to gain a more comprehensive list of these values.\nSpecular reflectance spectra, in the range of 250-4000 cm-1, were obtained for several oriented single crystal samples at three crystallographic orientations for each sample. Optical constants, n and k, were then derived through modeling of measured spectra using the Matlab lsqcurvefit function.\nPreveous work has identified the optical constants for two Mg rich natural samples, enstatite and hypersthene. Current research applies the above methodology to synthetic ferrosilite, the Fe rich end-member of the orthopyroxene mineral series. Future studies will provide a more comprehensive look at the variation of n and k as a function of the Mg:Fe composition.\n[1] Arnold, J.A. et al (2013) (under review), [2] Glotch, T.D. and Rossman, G.R.

            "abstract": "A set of nominally dry rocks (gabbro, granite, limestone, marble, and sandstone) were subjected to asymmetric loading with a large hydraulic press. A pair of precision platens made from 1018 low carbon steel were used to apply uniaxial compressive stress (σ) to the sample, via a thin electrical insulator made from ultra-high molecular weight (UHMW) polyethylene. Self-adhesive copper electrodes were applied and burnished on the end faces and the stress-stimulated current (SSC) was monitored using a Keithley 617 instrument. A preload stress level of 5.5 MPa was applied to firmly clamp the assembly throughout the experiment. From this baseline, σ was increased to 22.25 MPa and held for 100 seconds before returning to the clamping stress level. This loading profile was repeated for four or more cycles, with a stress rate on the order of 5MPa/sec. After the first load cycle, the SSC transients (and SSV offsets) are reversible when σ returned to its baseline level. All samples showed alternating unipolar SSC transients at the beginning and end of each load cycle. SSC from limestone, Westerly granite and marble were at, or below, the measurement limit (±1 pA). All other samples except sandstone showed a negative SSC with increasing stress. For stress-stimulated voltage (SSV) there was a richer variety of transients observed such as unipolar, bipolar and more complex transient dynamics. Limestone was the only sample tested with no SSV transients although this particular rock had a major calcite inclusion in the sample. White granite tended to have the least stable SSC and SSV values. Of the six different rock samples tested under identical conditions, the SSC and SSV observed were not greater than –15 pA, presumably due to improved experimental procedures. The response for rocks with semiconductor properties (gabbro, granite) is the same as those without semiconductor properties (limestone, marble), although the values for marble were below the noise. For repetitive Δσ of 16.7 MPa gabbro, limestone, and three types of granite showed negative or zero SSC, and sandstone exhibited roughly +1 pA SSC. In conclusion, use of a constant clamping force was found to eliminate a large source of instability in the experiment. Stability improved after the first full cycle, and if subsequent loads were kept below the maximum load of the first cycle.",

            "abstract": "Fossil shorelines record the areal extent of past lake expansions in closed basins of arid regions worldwide, reflecting hydrologic balance changes from one lake cycle to the next. Paleo-lake records from the northern Great Basin indicate low to intermediate lake levels there during the last glacial maximum (LGM: ca. 23-19 Cal ka BP) relative to those reached during the subsequent Deglacial interval, particularly in response to Heinrich events and attendant collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) during the Heinrich 1 (H1) stadial (ca. 17.5-14.6 Cal ka BP). Competing hypotheses about the causes of these cycles imply that southern Basin and Range paleo-lakes experienced lake-level maxima during the LGM, rendering shoreline chronologies from that region of paramount importance to understanding regional atmospheric dynamics during this critical climate transition. In southeastern Arizona, highstands of paleo-Lake Cochise overlapped with many highstands in the Great Basin, forming a composite beach ridge in Willcox Basin from ca. 17 to ca. 13 Cal ka BP. However, recent 14C dating of shells and carbonates within a calcareous mudstone unit (Unit 5) buried beneath the ridge constrain emplacement of Unit 5 to ca. 19 Cal ka BP; evidence from the faunal and stable isotopic composition of ostracode and gastropod assemblages reveals the mudstone’s lacustrine origin. Given that similar mudstones in drained basins of the southern Great Basin are known to have formed in paleo-wetlands, our findings have large implications for detecting and constraining the timing of ancient lake cycles and wetland expansions in arid closed basins worldwide. With respect to paleoclimate, the Unit 5 lake cycle occurred in advance of H1 and formation of the beach ridge by ~2 millennia, whereas the beach ridge continued to form following the H1 stadial. This suggests that lake cycles associated with the terminal LGM, H1 stadial, Bolling-Allerod, and Younger Dryas climatic intervals occurred in response to different triggers, themselves effecting major changes in AMOC circulation and/or sea-surface temperatures in the North Atlantic.",

            "abstract": "Earth’s current compositional structure and thermal state are linked to the conditions of its formation and differentiation, which can be deduced from physical principles and thermodynamics. The fundamental, shared rotational characteristics of the Solar System, e.g. the circular, co-planar orbits and upright axial spins, clearly record conditions of origin, yet are not explained by disk models. Current planetary spin and orbital rotational energies (R.E.) each nearly equal gravitational self-potential of formation (Ug), revealing mechanical energy conservation. We derive -ΔUg =Δ.R.E. from thermodynamics. Our conservative 3-d model, which allows for different behaviors of gas and dust, explains key Solar System characteristics (spin, orbits, gas giant compositions) and second-order features (dwarf planets, comet mineralogy, satellite system sizes). Gravitational heating during accretion, core formation and differentiation is insignificant because Ug is negative. Most heat production is due to internal radioactivity, and to a lesser extent by surficial impact heating. Core formation produces order and rotational energy associated with differential rotation, not internal heat.\nEarth’s beginning involved cooling via explosive outgassing of substantial ice (mainly CO) that was accreted with dust. High carbon content is inconsistent with present models yet is clearly expected from Solar abundances and ice in comets, and this profoundly affected compositional zonation. Reaction of CO with metal provided a carbide-rich core while converting MgSiO3 to olivine via oxidizing reactions. Differentiation and formation of the core and lower mantle greatly cooled the Earth, as outgassing occurred, magmas rose, and radioactive elements were segregated upwards. ",

Calibrating the seismic imagery with direct field observations allows us to quantify mechanical properties, image depth-dependent variations in weathering intensity, and identify the mobile-immobile regolith transition and differences in transport efficiency of mobile layers.\nWe conducted a cross-CZO comparison of N- and S-facing slopes at Boulder Creek and Shale Hills CZOs (BcCZO and SSHCZO) to investigate how near-surface weathering and hillslope morphology are influenced by differences in regional geology and climatic as well as local variations in aspect-controlled microclimate. Niwot Ridge (BcCZO) is a high alpine site with minimal soil/veg cover, characterized by steeper S-facing hillslopes; whereas, SSHCZO is a temperate, densely-forested, soil-mantled site with steeper N-facing slopes.\nOn Niwot Ridge, the depth of the weathering front and thickness of mobile regolith are substantially greater on shallower N-facing slopes; however, velocity-based estimates of transport efficiency are higher on S-facing slopes. Although, thin mobile regolith on S-facing slopes may be weaker (slower V), the lower gradient of N-facing slopes and southward asymmetry of the ridge divide, suggests greater transport efficiency on N-facing aspects. This can be explained by the dominance of frost/freeze process on N-facing slopes, which can efficiently develop and transport the thick mobile regolith.\nAt SSHCZO, depths of weathering fronts are invariant with slope aspect, suggesting that aspect control is not a predominant mechanism driving regolith production. Mobile regolith thickness, however, is more than 2-fold greater on N-facing slopes. Additionally, mobile regolith on both slope aspects is primarily composed of well-developed soils. N-facing soils are thicker with greater cohesion, moisture, and inclusion of rock fragments. This is consistent with velocity-based estimates of lower transport efficiency on N-facing slopes relative to the thin, dry, fine grained soils on S-facing slopes.",

Sediment and nutrient delivery to coastal waters have already been significantly altered by changes in population and land use, resulting in modified patterns of coastal production and carbon storage. Continued population growth and increasing agricultural areal extent and intensity are expected to accelerate these changes.\nThe USGS LandCarbon project developed prospective future land use and land cover projections based on IPCC scenarios A1b, A2 and B1 to 2050 as the basis for a multitude of biogeochemical assessments. We assessed the impacts on delivery of nutrients and sediments to the coastal ocean, and concomitant carbon storage. Fluxes were estimated using the SPARROW model, calibrated on historical water quality measurements.\nSignificantly greater fluxes of nutrients and sediments to coastal waters by 2050 are projected by the model. For example, for the Eastern United States, nitrate fluxes for 2050 are projected to be16 to 52 percent higher than the baseline year, depending on scenario. As a consequence, an associated increase in the frequency and duration of coastal and estuarine hypoxia events and harmful algal blooms could be expected. Model estimates indicate that these prospective future nutrient and sediment fluxes will increase carbon storage rates in coastal waters by 18 to 56 percent in some regions.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol particles of secondary organic material (SOM) were produced by α-pinene ozonolysis in a flow tube reactor. The aerosol flow was passed into a chamber with a long residence time where coagulation of primary particles occurred. An experimental apparatus, consisting of a differential mobility analyzer coupled to a particle mass analyzer (DMA-APM), was used to classify coagulated particles by particle electric mobility diameter (52.4 to 190.0 nm) and then to measure associated particle mass. From these data, the dynamic shape factor was determined for particles of known material density. Experiments were conducted for variable relativity humidity (RH). The results showed that the dynamic shape factor depended on post-coagulation particle number concentration, particle diameter, and relative humidity. For some particle number concentrations, coagulation occurred between particles of similar diameters under dry conditions (< 5% RH), thereby forming non-spherical particles. The dynamic shape factors were observed to change from 1.24 to 1.02 between 5 and 35% RH, and 1.27 to 1.03 between 20% to 60% RH， implying a transformation from non-spherical to round shapes. The shape change arose from decreased viscosity at elevated RH, allowing the material to flow and thereby form a spherical shape (i.e., as favored by minimization of surface area). Numerical modeling was used to estimate the particle viscosity associated with this flow. Based on the particle size and exposure time to elevated RH, the viscosity was determined from 109 Pa s down to 107 Pa s from 3% RH to 65% RH. The experiments establish a method for estimating the viscosity of suspended submicron aerosol particles based on changes in particle shape.",

            "abstract": "The semi-arid Limpopo Basin in Southern Africa experiences frequent droughts, leading to shortfall of water resources available to irrigation, drinking water supply and environmental flow requirements. In this paper we explore three approaches to seasonal forecasting streamflow and derived drought indices in the basin. The first applies the ECMWF seasonal forecast system (S4), an operational global atmospheric model that provides seasonal ensemble forecast with a lead time of six months. We apply a 30 year hindcast set available for S4 in forcing a 0.05O distributed hydrological model for the basin. The second approach uses the Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) method. This develops a forecast ensemble of six months lead time based on resampling historic meteorological data over the basin, and we again use this ensemble to force the hydrological model. The third approach again applies the ESP method, but we now use the ENSO index to condition the sampling probabilities.\nWe focus on comparing forecast skill over the wet season which is the most relevant to water users in the basin. Comparison of the skill of the three forecasting approaches in forecasting drought indices and streamflow shows that S4 is moderately skilful at the lead times up to 3-5 months. The ESP forecasts are skilful when compared to climatology, but only for the short lead times, and the skill decays rapidly with lead time. Forecasts based on the conditional ESP ensemble have improved skill when compared to ESP, though S4 forecasts remain superior. Through exploring drought indices that are used by reservoir operators in determining curtailments to water users we show how the forecasts can be meaningful to reservoir operators and irrigators in the basin.",

            "abstract": "We report analysis of kinetic simulations for precipitation of various particle beams (electrons, protons, mixed beam) and hydrodynamic simulations of flaring atmosphere heating by these beams using the approach described by Zharkova and Zharkov (2007). The results show temperature, density and macro-velocity variations as functions of both column and linear depths that for some beam parameters reveals a strong suppression of the upper atmosphere in a form of shocks towards the photosphere and beneath into the solar interior at some distances of 500-3000 km. The shocks deposited at different depths below the photosphere are found to produce varying seismic responses as per model by Zharkov (2013) while the atmospheres above the photosphere reveal various degrees of evaporation of the pressed ambient plasma into the corona depending on beam parameters. After a beam switch off the flaring atmospheres are shown to relax within short timescales to their original status. For physical models corresponding to hydrodynamic responses above we also simulate hydrogen emission produced by these atmospheres using full non-LTE approach and considering collisional excitation and ionisation by electron beams. We compare temporal and spatial distributions of HXR and optical emission in some flares with those produced by the complex simulations above, in attempt to resolve the puzzle of co-spatial formation of HXR and WL emission reported by Martinez-Oliveros et al.

            "abstract": "The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) Mission Education Program will participate in the multinational, multiagency program, Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE). GLOBE is a worldwide hands-on, primary and secondary school-based science and education community of over 24,000 schools in more than 100 countries. Over 1.5 million students have contributed more than 23 million measurements to the GLOBE database for use in inquiry-based science projects. The objectives of the program are to promote the teaching and learning of science; enhance environmental awareness, literacy and stewardship; and contribute to science research and environmental monitoring.\nSWOT will measure sea surface height and the heights, slopes, and inundated areas of rivers, lakes, and wetlands. This new SWOT-GLOBE partnership will focus on the limnology aspects of SWOT. These measurements will be useful in monitoring the hydrologic cycle, flooding, and climate impacts of a changing environment.\nGLOBE's cadre of teachers are trained in five core areas of Earth system science, including hydrology. The SWOT Education teams at NASA and CNES are working with the GLOBE Program implementers to develop and promote a new protocol under the Hydrology topic area for students to measure attributes of surface water bodies that will support mission science objectives. This protocol will outline and describe a methodology to measure width and height of rivers and lakes.\nThis new GLOBE protocol will be included in training to provide teachers with expertise and confidence in engaging students in this new scientific investigation. Performing this additional measurement will enhance GLOBE students experience in scientific investigation, and will provide useful measurements to SWOT researchers that can support the SWOT mission research goals.\nSWOT public engagement will involve communicating the value of its river and lake height measurements, lake water storage, and river discharge. This is also important to the GLOBE Program as curriculum integration of its hydrology measurements can be enhanced by strengthened ties to the concepts of watersheds and the hydrologic cycle. Understanding can also be increased of the relation of lake and river levels to drought and water supply.",

            "abstract": "Typhoons typically occur during Jul-Sep, and the average number of occurrences per year in North Pacific and land falling over South Korea is ~25 and ~3, respectively. They cause enormous damage to infrastructure and lives and more so to developing countries in the region. Hence, to manage and mitigate this natural hazard, robust estimates of typhoon risks are necessary. \nHistorical data is limited in length and incomplete in its variability. Thus, a methodology to generate a rich variety of realistic typhoon scenarios and the associated land fall risk along the coastal regions of their impact is important. \nTo this end, we propose a spatial Markov track simulation model. In this, the domain is divided into 5x5 grids, and a typhoon in a grid box has ten states to transit to in the following 6-hour period – they are moving into one of the 8 neighboring grids, staying or fizzling out in the same grid. Based on historical 6-hourly typhoon track data (for the period 1977 – 2013) transition probabilities (i.e. probability of transitioning to one of the aforementioned ten states from the current 6-hour period to the following 6-hour period) are compute. \nTyphoon origination probabilities are also computed for each grid box. A track is initiated from one of the grid boxes based on the origination probabilities and it is propagated by the spatial Markov transition probabilities. A large number of synthetic tracks are generated for the spatial Markov probabilities from which estimates of land falling risks can be computed for different coastal segments. \nWind speed magnitudes at each time step are generated by K-nearest neighbor resampling of the speeds of the historical tracks within each grid box based on the speed of the previous time step. A statistical distribution such as Weibull, can also be fitted for each neighborhood sample to simulate wind speeds. The Markov probabilities can also be estimated conditioned on large scale climate features that impact typhoon tracks to then generate track scenarios for any given year to enable seasonal projection. Extensions to simulating precipitation and consequently, streamflow and flooding risk are fairly straightforward. Our results show good representations of historical typhoon properties and thus promises to be an attractive methodology for natural hazard estimation.",

            "abstract": "In 2008 the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and cooperating universities and institutions issued USGS Open-File Report 2008-1262 (OFR) containing detailed guidelines for the performance of instrumentation to be used by the ANSS. Here we report an update underway to these guidelines to take account of lessons learned, changing technology, and expanding user desires; in a few instances, performance matters that are very hard to test in practice are either modified or removed. Instrument classes are defined in the OFR in terms of amplitude resolution and cost; because relevant technologies have advanced substantially in these six years and a number of groups have begun to explore the use of relatively inexpensive, entirely host installed and operated Class C systems, the guidelines for strong-motion sensors are being expanded to include detailed guidelines for them rather than just anticipating them. As always, Class A systems will form the state-of-the-art backbone of any network, with Class B filling in spatially and in areas otherwise not covered well. Class C systems would be an additional step in making networks denser by providing very inexpensive hardware, installation, and maintenance to fill in additionally between Class A and B sites, for example in a high-seismicity urban area, with Class A sites every 4–6 km, Class B every 2–3 km, and Class C at <1 km spacing. Class C devices would be both installed and maintained by hosts, not institutions, and therefore also would be economical for extending coverage in regions with widely spaced or rare large seismicity, such as the central and eastern U.S.",

            "abstract": "Current evaluations of Central Valley, California flood control improvements are based on climate and hydrologic conditions that occurred over the past 100 years. This historical period includes significant flood events caused by intense precipitation, rapid snowmelt, and watershed conditions that, in combination, result in the hydrologic conditions that have shaped the current flood infrastructure and management.\nFuture climate projections indicate the potential for increased flood peak flows and flood volumes in the Central Valley that will likely exceed the current capacity of existing flood control systems. Preliminary estimates of potential changes in flood flows have been developed for all the major watersheds in the Central Valley through the use of regionally downscaled climate projections and hydrologic modeling. Results suggest increasing flood risks that are dependent on spatial climate change patterns, individual watershed characteristics, and existing infrastructure investments.\nIn many areas, the increasing flood risks cannot be managed through traditional flood infrastructure alone, and more adaptive measures are needed to improve resilience under climate extremes. Planning approaches are being applied to consider the full range of flood risks, and include tiered interventions for events beyond the floods-of-record. The on-going flood risk planning efforts demonstrate new, and sensible approaches toward improving resilience for uncertain and evolving climate extremes.",

            "abstract": "Most electric power and transmission facilities in Japan operate for half a century or more, so it is important to ensure against general fatigue and damage from extreme weather and climate events. There is therefore a critical demand for useful assessments of the present weather and accurate predictions of future weather and climate.\nTropical Cyclones (TCs) are among the most destructive weather phenomenon to the industry. This study compares simulated TC activity in regional climate simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and global climate simulations using the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) specifically to identify the benefits of global variable resolution simulation. Horizontal refinement to approximately 20km grid spacing over the Northwest Pacific is achieved through nesting for WRF and MPAS uses a variable resolution mesh. The ability of these two simulation approaches to capture TC activity is examined in single-year continuous simulations from May 2005 to April 2006.\nCompared to surface station and satellite derived rainfall datasets, tropical precipitation patterns are reproduced reasonably well by both models, but the annual precipitation totals are overestimated. Similarly, using an automated TC identification and tracking algorithm, results show that both models reproduce well TC genesis regions, tracks, wind-pressure relationships, and intensification rate, but TC frequencies are overestimated by both models. These results indicate that global variable resolution simulation is a suitable tool to study regional climate and TC activity. Future work will use MPAS to simulate longer periods of current and future climate to provide a unique view of the future change TC activity over Japan, tailored to the needs of the electric power industry.",

            "abstract": "In the framework of the EURO-CORDEX initiative an ensemble of European-wide high resolution regional climate simulations on a 0.11° (~12.5 km) grid has been generated. This study investigates whether the high resolution regional climate models are able to add value to the simulated mean and extreme daily and sub-daily precipitation compared to their coarser resolution 0.44° (~50 km) counterparts. Therefore, pairs of low and high resolution simulations of 8 reanalysis driven models are compared to high resolution gridded observations in the Alps, Germany, Sweden, Norway, France, the Carpathians, and Spain. There is clear evidence that the 0.11° simulations are able to improve the representation of both mean and extreme precipitation in all regions and seasons, even on the spatial scale of the low resolution simulations (50 km grid). The 0.11° simulations are able to reduce biases in large areas of the investigated regions, have an improved representation of spatial precipitation patterns, and precipitation distributions are improved for daily and in particular for 3 hourly precipitation sums. When the evaluation is conducted on the high resolution (12.5 km) grid, the added value of the 0.11° models becomes even more obvious. The primary reason for these improvements seems to be better resolved orography, since most added value is found in and around mountainous regions.",

            "abstract": "The usual picture of solsticial Hadley Cells gives the impression of air moving from one hemisphere to the other in a smooth manner. The classic theories of the Hadley Cell are based on angular momentum conservation with the additional consideration of some mixing. However potential vorticity (PV) conservation, which includes potential temperature conservation as well as angular momentum/vorticity constraints, tells us that air cannot move easily from one hemisphere to the other. Near the surface, topographic and frictional processes, aided by diabatic processes, are able to overcome the PV constraint. However in the upper troposphere there are no equivalent frictional processes. The cross equatorial mass flux occurs in PV streamers that are mixed in in the winter subtropics or reach and amplify the anticyclonic side of the winter subtropical jets. The cross equatorial motion in the upper troposphere takes place in westerly waves on the oceanic ITCZs and in convective events in monsoon heating regions. The extent to which these aspects are important for weather and climate will be discussed.",

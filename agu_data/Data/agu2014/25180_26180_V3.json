            "abstract": "In natural subduction zones, frontal accretion dominantly occurs via the propagation of forethrusts, whereas accretion via backthrusts has been observed in only a few active subduction zones, including the Cascadia margin. Similarly, in most analog experiments of accretionary wedges deformation is accommodated by forethrusts or backthrust/forethrust pairs, except for some experiments with a layer of silicone below sand, which can produce accretionary backthrusts. Vertical deflection of the detachment caused by the lateral flow of the silicone layer could promote the propagation of backthrusts in these analog experiments. Alternatively, the high Holocene sediment input in parts of the Cascadia margin could produce vertical compaction deep within the wedge that promotes backthrusting. To explore the effect of vertical compaction and deflection of the detachment on fault development in accretionary prisms we use the Boundary Element Method modeling tool Growth by Optimization of Work (GROW) to predict the vergence of faults in a deforming wedge. GROW predicts fault growth by propagating faults in the direction that maximizes the efficiency of the system, or minimizes the external work of the system. We simulate vertical compaction with compliant elements and observe that the addition of these elements deep in the wedge or along the detachment promotes backthrusting rather than forethrusts. Similarly, local downward deflection of the detachment promotes backthrust development over that of forethrusts. These numerical model results suggest that vertical compaction or local deflection of the megathrust may account for backthrust development in parts of the Cascadia margin.",

The TWAP River Basin component consists of a baseline comparative assessment of 270 transboundary river basins, including all but the smallest basins, to enable the identification of priority issues and hotspots at risk from a variety of stressors. The assessment is indicator based and it is intended to provide a relative analysis of basins based on risks to societies and ecosystems. Models and observational data have been used to create 14 indicators covering environmental, human and agricultural water stress; nutrient and wastewater pollution; extinction risk; governance and institutions; economic dependence on water resources; societal wellbeing at sub-basin scales; and societal risks from climate extremes. The methodology is not limited to transboundary basins, but can be applied to all river basins. This presentation will provide a summary of the methods and results of the TWAP River Basin component. It will also briefly discuss preliminary results of the TWAP lakes and aquifer components.",

            "abstract": "Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a stable synthetic class of chemicals ubiquitously spread in environmental media (i.e. air, soil, biota, surface water and groundwater). The substances’ strong polar carbon-fluorine bonds and their high thermal and chemical stability make them resistant to biological, chemical, and physical degradation. The purpose of this research is to identify the most effective oxidation method to treat perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) and their by-products that is suitable for in situ application. The laboratory oxidation study focuses on the more commonly detected and studied long-chain (C-8) PFAS; perfluorooctanoic acids (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS).\nExisting research evaluating oxidizing treatment effectiveness on perfluoroalkyl sulfoinoic acids (PFSAs) is limited. A review of the literature and results from preliminary studies indicate that activated persulfate and catalyzed hydrogen peroxide propagation (CHP) reactions appear to be promising oxidants for PFOA. It has been demonstrated that the reactivity of superoxide in water increases in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and solids. Superoxide generated in CHP reactions degrades PFOA seemingly similar to superoxide-mediated destruction of the perhalogenated compounds.\nThe goal of this study is to look at conditions that promote generation of superoxide and look at PFASs treatment effectiveness and byproduct generation. CHP reactions are conducted with varying amount of H2O2 and Fe(III) to determine the optimum conditions for PFC degradation. Results will be compared to those of another experiment using manganese dioxide as a CHP catalyst with varied H2O2 concentration to generate superoxide to degrade PFASs. Activated persulfate conditions to be compared include alkaline pH activation, heat activation, and dual oxidation (combined H2O2 and persulfate ). This presentation will focus on a comparison of oxidation effectiveness under the varied reaction conditions as well as on the oxidation intermediates and byproducts generated toward improved understanding of the potential for and limitations of in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) for treatment of PFCs.",

            "abstract": "Biogenic secondary organic aerosol particles are investigated in the Amazon in the context of the GoAmazon Project. The forest naturally emits a large number of gaseous compounds; they are called the volatile organic compounds (VOCs). They are emitted through processes that are not totally understood. Part of those gaseous compounds are converted into aerosol particles, which affect the biogeochemical cycles, the radiation balance, the mechanisms involving cloud formation and evolution, among few other important effects. In this study the aerosol life-cycle is investigated at the ATTO station, which is located about 150 km northeast of Manaus, with emphasis on the natural organic component and its impacts in the ecosystem. To achieve these objectives physical and chemical aerosol properties have been investigated, such as the chemical composition with aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM), nanoparticle size distribution (using the SMPS - Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer), optical properties with measurements of scattering and absorption (using nephelometers and aethalometers). Those instruments have been operating continuously since February 2014 together with trace gases (O3, CO2, CO, SO2 and NOx) analyzers and additional meteorological instruments. On average PM1 (the sum of black carbon, organic and inorganic ions) totalized 1.0±0.3 μg m-3, where the organic fraction was dominant (75%). During the beginning of the dry season (July/August) the organic aerosol presented a moderate oxygenated character with the oxygen to carbon ratio (O:C) of 0.7. In the wet season some episodes containing significant amount of chloride and backward wind trajectories suggest aerosol contribution from the Atlantic Ocean. A more comprehensive analysis will include an investigation of the different oxidized fractions of the organic aerosol and optical properties.",

            "abstract": "Bray and von Storch (2009) showed that there is considerable confusion among scientists in differentiating forecasts, projections, and scenarios, and that this confusion is echoed by the IPCC.\nThese misunderstandings are not only found in making predictions, and in classifying which future-statements count as predictions, but also under which circumstances predictions must be verified. There is general recognition that good models produce good forecasts, but there is no escape from the implication that a bad forecast arises from a flawed model by claiming a forecast wasn't a forecast (or prediction) but a projection or scenario (see e.g. Risbey, 2014).\nWe show forecasts, projections, and scenarios (when used prospectively) are equivalent, and that all face the same burden of verification.\nAny model M, statistical or physical, is a complex mixture of past data, time, and external evidence which specifies the model form. Forecasts f about some observable y are conditional on M and on a guess \"x\" about what the future holds. (Confusingly, sometimes x is called a \"scenario\" and sometimes the whole forecast is called a \"scenario\".)\nThe simplest x is that the future comes in discrete time points, e.g. f(yt+1 |M, t+1...). Assuming its components are probative of y, x may be compound. E.g., suppose a climate model is built so that it is sensitive to oil price, thus x = \"Price of oil > p and t+1\".\nIf at t+1 the price of oil was not <= p, then the forecast is null: no forecast has been made, because the conditions x were not met. At this point, some might call this forecast a \"projection\" and ignore its verification. But since this x is probative of y, the model also implies the forecast f(y | Price <= p, t+1), which should be (after-the-fact) computed and then verified.\nExamples where predictions which have \"escaped\" verification, as well as strategies of verification, will be given.",

            "abstract": "X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) is a non destructive analytical technique widely used to estimate the elemental composition of sedimentary records. This analytical technique measure a number of elements in a sample with a resolution similar or better than conventional destructive methods, is quick and requires minimal analytical effort.\nWe tested the precision and reliability of a handheld XRF instrument (DELTA Premium-XRF analyzer) and developed a methodological calibration of the equipment considered to be a potential tool for paleo-environmental investigations, i.e., in the reconstruction of past oxygen concentrations by analyzing redox sensitive trace metals like Mo, which is sequestered from the water column and transferred to the underlying sediments under anoxic and sulfidic conditions (euxinic).\nCalibration of the instrument was performed using eight certified standards and twelve in-house standards to create a calibration curve and its linear regression model (Pearson, r2=0.98 and p<0.001). Once the XRF was calibrated, the total concentrations of Mo were determined in gravity and multiple cores (NH01-20, 21, 22 and NH01-25, 26, 27) recovered during the CALMEX NH-01 cruise in the eastern slopes of Carmen and Pescadero basins (Gulf of California, Mexico). These sites are intersected by an Oxygen Minimum Zone promoting excellent sediment preservation. All cores were sampled every 1 cm to obtain high-resolution records of the last ~10,000 years. We conclude that handheld XRF enables precise and exact determinations of Mo concentrations in sediments, applied to the characterization of past euxinic environments.",

            "abstract": "This study demonstrates that stream flow changes are detectable several decades after forest disturbance. Evidence is based on empirical data available from US long-term paired watershed studies. Changes in the long-term streamflow records are continuous and occur over a range of flow conditions reflecting forest disturbance severity, regrowth dynamics, vegetation type, and watershed characteristics. Whereas many published studies have focused on annual or seasonal flows, we show that high and low flow percentiles are more sensitive to forest disturbance over decades. We developed a new method to quantify relative and absolute changes in streamflow for ten groups of flow percentiles including the statistical significance between reference and treatment watersheds. Increases in lower flows occur at all sites immediately after forest removal or removal with vegetation suppression mostly ranging between 50-100% relative flow increase. In the regrowth phase, however, most sites show decreases in low flows due to increases in transpiration. Perhaps surprisingly, while low flows may still be reduced decades after disturbance, some watersheds had increased high flows (e.g., at 80th and 90th flow percentiles) 20 to 30 years after disturbance. The long-term change in seasonal runoff yield showed variable responses among the nine long-term paired watershed studies. For several of the disturbed watersheds, the cumulative yield increased up to 14 times the summer runoff within 30-40 years. In light of continuing loss of forest land or changes to forest cover globally and in North America, we recommend maintaining and establishing highly valuable long-term hydrological records of paired watershed studies that empirically allow for the examination of long-term change and variability of streamflow response to forest management and disturbance. These records are also important for testing models in their ability to reproduce the long-term forest disturbance effects as shown in this study. The ability to detect legacies of forest disturbance emphasizes the need to consider not only the sensitivity of the watershed to climate, but to coupled climate and vegetation change for addressing hydrological responses to global change.",

            "abstract": "We document observations of late stage volcanism in the western Pacific Pigafetta Basin by integrating previously published and new multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection profiles, Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) drill core, and well log data. We examine data from three seismic experiments (FM35-12, MESOPAC II, and MTr5) conducted in the Pigafetta Basin, one of the oldest, deepest abyssal basins in the world, where crustal age is suggested to range from M29 (~157 Ma) to M44 (~169.8 Ma) based on Japanese Mesozoic magnetic lineations. We use a total of ~2150 km of MCS lines along with core and wire-line logging data from ODP Hole 801C. As a basis for our interpretation, we use previously defined seismic stratigraphy for the Pigafetta Basin, including Horizon B (basement) and lower transparent unit (volcaniclastic turbidites) terminology. We build synthetic seismograms from density and p-wave velocity logs using OpendTect v 4.6.0 tie well to seismic feature. We then incorporate energy and similarity attributes of the MCS profiles with the modeled seismogram to correlate reflectors to ODP Hole 801C lithostratigraphy. From this correlation, to be consistent with previous studies, we assign lithology and age to prominent sedimentary and basement reflectors throughout all survey lines. We characterize widely distributed deformation of Horizon B and lower sedimentary unit reflectors based on coherency of wiggle traces, lateral and vertical energy attenuation, and dip of reflectors over a range of scales (>10 km to <1 km). Our findings provide new evidence of late stage volcanism occurring in the Pigafetta Basin during the mid-Cretaceous (110 – 90 Ma). We classify late stage volcanism into 3 types of volcanic related features: (1) seamounts, (2) sills, and (3) vertical seismic disturbance zones (<<1 km wide) characterized by bilateral upward drag of reflectors (indicating a thin, vertical volcanic intrusion). The distribution of these features provide new insights into Cretaceous volcanism in the Pigafetta Basin: (i) late stage volcanism is more widely distributed and younger than previously reported, (ii) findings indicate a local source of magma, and (iii) the modes of volcanism differ from previously documented flood basalts and massive flows.",

            "abstract": "Tidewater glaciers play an important role in many landscape and ecosystem processes in fjords, terminating in the sea and calving icebergs and discharging meltwater directly into the ocean. Tidewater glaciers provide floating ice for use as habitat for harbor seals (Phoca vitulina richardii) for resting, pupping, nursing, molting, and avoiding predators. Tidewater glaciers are found in high concentrations in Southeast and Southcentral Alaska; currently, many of these glaciers are retreating or have stabilized in a retracted state, raising questions about the future availability of ice in these fjords as habitat for seals. Our primary objective is to investigate the relationship between harbor seal distribution and ice availability at an advancing tidewater glacier in Johns Hopkins Inlet, Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska. To this end, we use a combination of visible and infrared aerial photographs, object-based image analysis (OBIA), and statistical modeling techniques. We have developed a workflow to automate the processing of the imagery and the classification of the fjordscape (e.g., individual icebergs, brash ice, and open water), providing quantitative information on ice coverage as well as properties not typically found in traditional pixel-based classification techniques, such as block angularity and seal density across the fjord. Reflectance variation in the red channel of the optical images has proven to be the most important first-level criterion to separate open water from floating ice. This first-level criterion works well in areas without dense brash ice, but tends to misclassify dense brash ice as single icebergs. Isolating these large misclassified regions and applying a higher reflectance threshold as a second-level criterion helps to isolate individual ice blocks surrounded by dense brash ice. We present classification results from surveys taken during June and August, 2007-2013, as well as preliminary results from statistical modeling of the spatio-temporal distribution of seals and ice. OBIA is a powerful method of habitat classification and offers an effective approach to compare the spatio-temporal distribution and availability of glacial ice habitats for harbor seals in tidewater glacial fjords.",

            "abstract": "Around 14.5 ka, global sea level rose by around 15 m in less than 350 years (e.g. Deschamps et al., 2012) during an event known as Meltwater Pulse 1a (MWP1a). Modelling work by Gregoire et al. (2012) suggested that around half of this ~50 mm yr-1 sea level rise was caused by accelerated collapse of the ice saddle between the N. American, Cordilleran and Laurentide Ice Sheets. Sea level records place MWP1a in the Bolling-Allerod period, a time of Northern Hemisphere warmth, but dating uncertainties make it difficult to determine the sequence of events and their drivers, leaving many fundamental questions. For example, did the abrupt ice saddle collapse and melting from other ice masses have any detectable climatic impact, or were there no feedbacks? Was melting from the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets responsible for the Older-Dryas (Menviel et al., 2011) or other cooling events? And how were all these signals linked to changes in ocean overturning circulation?\nTo evaluate ice sheet impacts on climate during the Bolling, we integrate ice sheet, solid earth, drainage and climate modelling. We examine the effects of changing orography and meltwater inputs by combining ice-sheet model results, including the significant Laurentide–Cordilleran ice saddle collapse (Gregoire et al., 2012) and a new model of Antarctic ice sheet evolution (Gomez et al., 2013), with the ICE-5G reconstruction (Peltier et al., 2004). We route meltwater to the oceans using a high-resolution drainage calculation (Wickert et al., 2013). These modelled changes in global ice sheet topography and meltwater routing are then used to force the HadCM3 Ocean–Atmosphere–Vegetation general circulation model (using the 15 ka set-up of Singarayer and Valdes, 2010).\nWe compare the climate model results to proxy records for temperature and ocean circulation changes during the Bolling warming and the Older Dryas to evaluate the different hypotheses on the link between MWP1a and climate change.",

            "abstract": "Numerical modeling of beach and dune erosion, overwashing and breaching has gained much from inclusion of wave-group related infragravity motions in models such as XBeach (Roelvink et al, 2009). The main assumption in this model is that on the upper beach the incident-band, short waves are to a large extent dissipated, whereas infragravity wave motions have more oomph and are the ones making it to the dune foot and even over it. It is then justified to resolve the variations in short-wave energy and resulting long-wave motions, while parameterizing the short wave motions. This model has been applied successfully in many cases, both lab and field, concerning sandy beaches and dunes. However, as the sand gets coarser and beaches steeper, more and more incident wave energy is found in the swash, and at some point the parameterizations and associated coefficients start dominating the process. For gravel beaches, McCall et al (2014) have made use of a wave-resolving mode of XBeach, which makes use of a one-layer, nonhydrostatic approach developed by Zijlema et al. (2011). They have included a groundwater model and have shown that both the infiltration-exfiltration processes and the incident-band swash are important in getting the swash hydrodynamics on gravel beaches right. This work is continuing with promising results for morphodynamic response during extreme events. At the same time, we are investigating the skill of both approaches for wave runup and overtopping and are testing the morphodynamic behavior of the wave-resolving model in comparison with data and the original XBeach. So far, at the sandy end of the spectrum, both approaches give good and very similar results. In our presentation we will highlight some of these results and will present a sensitivity study where both approaches will be run and compared for a range of coastal profiles, including hard end structures. This will allow us to give clear guidelines for when to use the (much more computer-intensive) wave-resolving mode.",

The ozonolysis of alkenes in the atmosphere, i.e. the mechanism by which the SCIs are produced, is a major pathway to the formation of Secondary Organic Aerosols (SOA) in the atmosphere. Just how much SCIs contribute to the SOA formation is not well known and fundamental research in the kinetics of SCI formation need to be performed to shed light on this mystery.\nThe alkene ozonolysis is highly exothermic reaction, so a third body is needed for stabilizing the SCI, thus making the SCI yield pressure dependent. We studied the production of SCIs at different pressures by studying their ability to oxidize sulfur dioxide in a pressure controlled flow reactor. We used a mixture of ultra-high purity nitrogen, oxygen, and a selective scavenger for hydroxyl radical (OH) as a carrier gas, and injected a mixture of nitrogen, sulfur dioxide and selected alkene to the center of the flow for ozonolysis to take place. With the OH radical scavenged, the SCI yield of the reaction was measured by measuring the amount of sulfuric acid formed in the reaction between SCI and sulfur dioxide with a Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometer (CIMS).\nThis work was supported by NASA/ROSES grant NNX12AE54G to CMU and Academy of Finland Center of Excellence project 1118615.",

            "abstract": "On-road emissions comprised 29% of U.S. fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions in 2012, with 64% of those emissions occurring in urban areas. Understanding the social, economic and technological factors that influence urban emissions requires the development of emissions inventories that are resolved at fine spatial and temporal scales. As city governments are increasingly at the forefront of developing policies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, high-resolution, bottom-up inventories will support local and regional emissions benchmarking, as well as the monitoring, reporting, and verification of trends in emissions across time and space. To that end, we combine a large regional dataset of hourly traffic counts with the 1km gridded estimates of on-road CO2 emissions from the Database of Road Transportation Emissions (DARTE) to develop hourly CO2 emissions estimates for the year 2012 that cover 12 northeastern states. The inventory scope covers several large metropolitan regions as well as many small- and medium-sized urban, suburban and exurban population centers, altogether representing 20% of urban and 17% of total U.S. on-road CO2 emissions in 2012.\nWe identify significant variation in the time structure of vehicle emissions across the urban-suburban gradients of the Boston, New York, and Washington, D.C. metropolitan areas. In particular we note considerable spatial variation between morning and evening peak periods, both within and between cities, as well as variations in the duration of peak periods, depending on time of year and spatial location. We also examine the relationship between the temporal and spatial structure of morning and evening peak period emissions and the spatial distribution of population and employment density across urban to rural gradients. Finally we utilize data on minute-by-minute vehicle speeds to quantify the effect of traffic congestion on vehicle CO2 emission rates across the Boston metro area, and we highlight the sensitivity of congestion to small sub-hourly variations in traffic flows at key periods of the morning and evening rush hours. Results from our analysis demonstrate the potential for reducing vehicle emissions through time-sensitive toll pricing or commuter incentive schemes targeting peak period vehicle use on urban freeways.",

            "abstract": "Coseismic displacements from the largest earthquakes are easily detected in geodetic time series over a large area, up to a few thousand km from the fault. For example, detectable displacements from the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake were reported as far away as Korea, and detectable displacements from the 2011 Tohoku earthquake were reported as far away as Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. The great reach of these events means that they can distort geodetic coordinates on a global scale, they impact the ability of users to access the reference frame. Point source (Centroid Moment Tensor) and finite fault models for large events are routinely available from purely seismological data (or potentially from local geodetic data), so it is worthwhile to know hwo well we can predict coseismic displacements at GPS sites from independent or quasi-independent data. Ultimately, a suite of geophysical models based on seismic or near-field geodetic data could provide estimates of far-field displacements and uncertainties that may be used for detection of subtle offsets in geodetic time series, and for correction of global coordinates.\nSlip models based only on teleseismic data do not predict displacments well near the earthquake rupture, because teleseismic data do not resolve spatial details of the slip distribution. Farther from the source, coseismic displacements are not so sensitive to the details of the earthquake source model. Different codes for computing displacements for spherical layered Earth models have not been compared carefully before. Here we compare computed displacements using the method of Pollitz (1996) and the method of Sun et al. (2009) and Sun and Dong (2013). These codes are semi-analytical, so results are sensitive to the number of terms summed for computing Greens functions. We also compare the impact of different Earth models, including PREM, modified versions of PREM, ak135f, and a homogeneous sphere. Our preliminary assessment is that the choice of Earth model has a larger impact than the choice of software, as long as a sufficient number of terms are included for numerical accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Poloidal mode Alfven waves are often generated in Earth’s magnetosphere following interplanetary shocks and/or pressure pulses acting on the magnetopause. These disturbances can excite resonant field line oscillations with frequencies in the mHz range by launching fast mode waves that couple energy to field line resonances. This direct action of the solar wind on the magnetosphere can perhaps explain waves with relatively small azimuthal wavenumbers (m), but not the observed range of waves with m~40-50 on L-shells around 5 or 6. These waves are strongly guided along geomagnetic field lines to the ionosphere, and are generally thought to particle driven, e.g., as a result of bounce-resonance wave-particle interactions following activation of the ring current. This is not the only possible source mechanism as there is evidence of wave generation before the ring current has reacted significantly to shock passage. Putting aside the source mechanism, high-m poloidal modes with strong east west directed electric fields are important primarily because they can elevate differential energy flux for electron energies in the range of 100’s of keV to several MeV. In this paper we use observations of guided poloidal mode Alfven waves to constrain a ULF wave model that describes not only how waves evolve on geomagnetic field lines, but also their interaction with a dynamic height-resolved ionosphere. The ionosphere and neutral atmosphere are specified in the model using the IRI and MSIS models. These regions react to waves and precipitation through heating and cooling, ionization, recombination, and chemical reactions. We present detailed results of the interaction of a poloidal wave observed by the Eiscat radar, and demonstrate that the model used can reproduce all aspects of the radar observations. We consider mechanisms for pulsed precipitation accompanying this wave, which causes a phase difference of ~90 degrees between observed temperature and density spikes. We also demonstrate that increased production of heavy NOx molecular ions is necessary to explain rapid rates of decay of density perturbations in the ionosphere.",

            "abstract": "We present new images of lithospheric structure obtained from P-to-S receiver functions at 86 broadband seismic stations we deployed as part of the EarthScope IDOR experiment. The high-quality data of the IDOR survey allowed us to image in detail the crustal thickness, and the structure of the lithospheric mantle beneath the Blue Mountains accreted terranes and the Paleozoic margin of North America. At the surface, the ~110 Ma suture between the arc terranes and the North American Craton is marked by the dextral transpressional system of the Western Idaho Shear Zone (WISZ), which closely follows the Sr 0.706 isopleth. Long-lived magmatism (108 – 50 Ma) of the Idaho Batholith occurred during and after the WISZ deformation. We constructed more than 7000 P-to-S teleseismic receiver functions using iterative time domain deconvolution, and we used H-k grid search, inversion, and common conversion point stacking (CCP) to image the lithospheric structure. Moho depths vary from 35-40 km beneath the Blue Mountain terranes and the extended regions of central Idaho, and shallow to ~30 km in the central part of the IDOR network. We see a clear break in the continuity of the Moho across the WISZ, with depths increasing from 30 to 40 km east of the WISZ. We also see a strong mid-crustal converting interface at 15-20 km depth beneath the Idaho Batholith on the east side of the WISZ. To the east, beneath the Lost River Range and Pahsimeroi valley, we see an offset in Moho depth possibly related to Basin-and-Range extension. A strong shallow contrast in crustal velocities beneath the West Snake River Plain is probably due to Columbia River Basalts and sedimentary cover. We observe a horizontal, continuous positive amplitude phase at ~90 km across the entire network that we interpret as the Mid-Lithospheric Discontinuity. A second positive amplitude phase varies from ~120 km beneath the accreted terranes to ~140 km beneath the western margin of the North American Craton. The increase in depth in this phase occurs over a horizontal distance of ~160 km and is most likely related to the contact between the accreted Blue Mountain lithosphere and Precambrian North America. This structure lies at depths consistent with the regional lithosphere boundary resolved by Yuan and Romanowicz (2010).",

            "abstract": "The radiative behaviour of clouds is dependent on cloud particle phase. Water droplets can exist in temperatures well below 0° C for extended periods. Lidar depolarization measurements allow liquid and solid states to be differentiated in individual clouds at high spatial-temporal resolution. The 2012, 2013 and 2014 Canadian Arctic ACE Validation Campaigns in Eureka, Nunavut, Canada (80°N, 86°W) provided an opportunity to make extensive depolarization measurements using the CANDAC Rayleigh-Mie-Raman Lidar (CRL) in the troposphere.\nTo date, most calibration methods in the literature are applicable to lidars which do not have non-ideal polarizing optics upstream of the polarizing analyzers in the receiver. We demonstrate a more complete matrix algebra calibration of the CRL to take the extra optics from six upstream lidar channels into account.\nDifferences in depolarization parameter from 2013 and 2014 measurements show the advantage of the more extensive calibration for this lidar compared to the simpler traditional approach. The largest differences are found for depolarization parameter values around d = 0.50 (corresponding to δ = 0.33). Depolarization ratio values of δ = 0.2 to 0.3 are generally taken to be the cutoff between interpretations of ice (higher δ) or water (lower δ), and many CRL measurements lie in this particularly diagnostic range. An uncertainty analysis becomes important when extending the depolarization parameters to interpretation of the clouds in the atmosphere above Eureka.",

            "abstract": "The merits of dissolved cadmium as a paleo-proxy for phosphorus has long been discussed. Dissolved ratios of Cd:P (nmol/µmol) have been shown in previous studies to be relatively constant in deep-water samples. Younger Atlantic waters typically have dissolved Cd:P of about 0.2 while older Pacific waters have a higher value of 0.36. The mid-water dissolved Cd:P differences between the Atlantic and Pacific represent an integrated signature of remineralized particulates over a span of hundreds to 1,000 years. The trends of upper ocean dissolved Cd:P suggest regional differences exist due to differences in phytoplankton uptake and particle export. Particles turn over quickly (week time scales in near surface waters – year time scales at 1000 m) and therefore direct analysis can be used to understand what causes variability in the Cd:P ratios in different phytoplankton communities under a variety of conditions. To address the drivers of inter-ocean variation, concentrations of elements, in particular Cd, Co, Zn and P were determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass-Spectrometry in size-fractionated particulates collected using the Multiple Unit Large Volume in-situ Filtration System (MULVFS) from the upper 1000 m at the 34 different locations throughout the Atlantic, Pacific and Southern Oceans since 1991. The MULVFS technique simultaneously collects samples in three size fractions from thousands of liters of water: <1 μm, 1-51 μm and >51 μm. The collection sites have wide spatial and temporal distribution, allowing us to study the effects of an El Nino, upwelling, large scale in-situ Fe fertilization, anoxic conditions, a phytoplankton bloom and subsequent decline, and seasonal variation of Cd:P in particulates. Overall, Cd:P tends to be higher (typically 1-2 pmol/nmol) in particulates gathered in biologically dynamic waters, especially in High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll (HNLC) areas such as the subarctic north Pacific, equatorial Pacific, and Southern Ocean, and in Upwelling areas, and is much lower (typically <0.1 pmol/nmol) in oligotrophic regions. Here we present a global analysis exploring how differences in regional Cd:P particulates lead to the relatively constant dissolved deep water ratios. These results are the first global collection of particulate euphotic zone Cd:P ratios.",

            "abstract": "Forest disturbance and recovery are among the major processes modulating biosphere-atmosphere carbon fluxes. Quantifying these fluxes therefore requires detailed spatio-temporal understanding of forest disturbance and post-disturbance recovery processes. As a core activity of the North American Carbon Program (NACP), the North American Forest Dynamics (NAFD) project is designed to produce a detailed assessment of forest dynamics over the U.S. Major objectives of this project include assessing forest disturbance across the conterminous U.S. (CONUS), validating the derived disturbance products, understanding the causal factors, and evaluating post-disturbance recovery processes. The NAFD study is enabled by the NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) collaborative computing facility, which provides massive computing and storage capacity, as well as convenient access to all required Landsat and ancillary datasets. It has produced a detailed analysis of CONUS forest disturbance for the time period 1986-2010. The main purpose of this presentation is to report the results derived through this analysis. One of the products of this analysis includes annual, detailed U.S. maps of forest disturbance patterns. These products were produced on the NEX using 20,000+ best available Landsat images acquired during that time period. They have been validated using reference data derived using the TimeSync tool at sample locations selected from across the nation. In this presentation we will first provide a brief overview of the NAFD project and then present key findings derived from the NAFD disturbance assessment, including disturbance rates, patterns, and their spatio-temporal variability at national and sub-national scales. Issues, lessons learned, and implications for future disturbance monitoring will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Thickness andseismic velocity of crustal layers are useful for understanding the history and evolution of continental lithosphere. Lowry and Pérez-Gussinyé (2011) observed that low bulk crustal seismic velocity ratio, Vp/Vs, strongly correlates with high geothermal gradient and active deformation, indicating quartz (to which Vp/Vs is most sensitive) plays a role in these processes. The lower crust (where ductile flow occurs which might explain the relationship) is commonly thought to be quartz-poor. However, layering of the crust may represent changes in either lithology or the phase of quartz. Laboratory strain-stress experiments on quartz indicate that near the a- to b-quartz phase transition, both Vp and Vp/Vs initially drop dramatically but then increase relative to the a-quartz regime because Young’s modulus initially decreases by 30% before increasing by a net ~20%. Shear modulus varies only ~3% across the transition. Crustal structure is commonly represented by an upper, mid- and lower layer (e.g., Crust1.0) and conceptualized as primarily reflecting a change to more mafic lithology at greater depth, but estimates of Moho temperature indicate a quartz phase transition should be present in much of the western and central U.S. We have imaged multiple layering of the contiguous U.S. by applying a new cross-correlation and stacking method to USArray receiver functions. Synthetic models of a multiple layer crust indicate ‘splitting’ of converted-phase arrivals would be expected if a quartz phase transition were responsible. Preliminary imaging using cross-correlation of observed receiver functions with multiple layer synthetics demonstrates a marked improvement in correlation coefficients relative to a single-layer crust. In this presentation we will examine observational evidence for possible a- to b- phase transition layering (indicating quartz at depth) and compare with depths predicted for the quartz phase transition based on Pn-derived Moho temperatures and estimates of magnetic Curie depths.",

            "abstract": "Basaltic volcanic eruptions commonly follow a characteristic sequence of events. In the upper few kilometers of the crust, magma rises in planar dikes, which result in fissure eruptions when they intersect the surface. In some cases, the fissures do not feed significant eruptions and die out within hours. In other cases, magma stops flowing in much of the fissure, but continues to erupt from discrete vents, until finally the flow is sustained through a single vent underlain by a volcanic plug that is able to carry much greater volumes of magma to the surface. Ancient volcanic systems that have been exposed by erosion provide a unique opportunity to directly investigate a volcanic plumbing system and gain insight on the physical mechanisms responsible for conduit geometry evolution. Here we present field data from an Oligocene-aged dike-plug system at Ship Rock, New Mexico, collected from a DEM and overlaying orthophotograph made using new techniques from structure from motion. We document and characterize a systematic set of over 200 dike-perpendicular joints found in the sedimentary host rock adjacent to the intrusions. This joint set, along with a set of dike-parallel joints and the bedding planes in the host rock, allows the host rock to be broken into individual blocks that can be subsequently entrained in the flowing magma to widen the dike. We use elastic crack models and solutions for coupled heat and fluid flow in porous media to understand the conditions necessary for host-rock fracturing to occur. We show that this fracturing is intimately associated with the interaction of magma and groundwater and is a precursor to erosion of the host rock and sustained flow through discrete vents.",

            "abstract": "The Sunda subduction zone features significant along-strike structural variability including changes in accretionary prism and forearc morphology. Some of these changes have been linked to changes in megathrust faulting styles, and some have been linked to other thrust and strike-slip fault systems across this obliquely convergent margin (~54-58 mm/yr convergence rate, 40-45 mm/yr subduction rate). We examine these structural changes in detail across central Sumatra, from Siberut to Nias Island, offshore Indonesia. In this area the Investigator Fracture Zone and the Wharton Fossil Ridge, features with significant topography, are being subducted, which may affect sediment thickness variation and margin morphology. We present new seismic refraction P-wave velocity models using marine seismic data collected during Sonne cruise SO198 in 2008. The experiment geometry consisted of 57 ocean bottom seismometers, 23 land seismometers, and over 10,000 air gun shots recorded along ~1750 km of profiles. About 130,000 P-wave first arrival refractions were picked, and the picks were inverted using FAST (First Arrivals Refraction Tomography) 3-D to give a velocity model, best-resolved in the top 25 km. Moho depths, crustal composition, prism geometry, slab dip, and upper and lower plate structures provide insight into the past and present tectonic processes at this plate boundary. We specifically examine the relationships between velocity structure and faulting locations/ styles. These observations have implications for strain-partitioning along the boundary. The Mentawai Fault, located west of the forearc basin in parts of Central Sumatra, has been interpreted variably as a backthrust, strike-slip, and normal fault. We integrate existing data to evaluate these hypotheses. Regional megathrust earthquake ruptures indicate plate boundary segmentation in our study area. The offshore forearc west of Siberut is almost aseismic, reflecting the locked state of the plate interface, which last ruptured in 1797. The weakly-coupled Batu segment experiences sporadic clusters of events near the forearc slope break. The Nias segment in the north ruptured in the 2005 M8.7 earthquake. We compare P-wave velocity structure to the earthquake data to examine potential links between lithospheric structure and seismogenesis.",

            "abstract": "In much of the world cities are warming at twice the rate of outlying rural areas. The frequency of urban heat waves is projected to increase with climate change through the 21stcentury. Addressing the economic, environmental, and human costs of urban heat islands requires a better understanding of their behavior from many disciplinary perspectives. The goal of this four-year Urban Heat Island Network is to (1) bring together scientists studying the causes and impacts of urban warming, (2) advance multidisciplinary understanding of urban heat islands, (3) examine how they can be ameliorated through engineering and design practices, and (4) share these new insights with a wide array of stakeholders responsible for managing urban warming to reduce their health, economic, and environmental impacts. The Urban Heat Island Network involves atmospheric scientists, engineers, architects, landscape designers, urban planners, public health experts, and education and outreach experts, who will share knowledge, evaluate research directions, and communicate knowledge and research recommendations to the larger research community as well as stakeholders engaged in developing strategies to adapt to and mitigate urban warming.\nThe first Urban Climate Institute was held in Saint Paul, Minnesota in July 2013 and focused on the characteristics of urban heat islands. Scientists engaged with local practitioners to improve communication pathways surrounding issues of understanding, adapting to, and mitigating urban warming. The second Urban Climate Institute was held in Atlanta, Georgia in July 2014 and focused on urban warming and public health. Scientists discussed the state of the science on urban modeling, heat adaptation, air pollution, and infectious disease. Practitioners informed participants on emergency response methods and protocols related to heat and other extreme weather events. Evaluation experts at the Science Museum of Minnesota have extensively evaluated both Institutes to improve future Institutes and to inform other research coordination networks. Two more Institutes are planned for 2015 and 2016 focusing on urban warming and the built environment, and education and outreach.",

Developing tools to monitor water availability and water use is critical to meet future water shortage challenges in the American West. This study applied METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration at high Resolution and with Internalized Calibration) to 2001 Landsat imagery to estimate ET of various crop types in Phoenix. The total annual ET estimates are correlated well with the actual water use at the irrigation district level (r=0.99). We further incorporated a crop type map to estimate annual ET for the major crop types in the region, and to examine variability in crop water use among different irrigation districts. Our results show that alfalfa and double crops consume more water than other crop types with mean annual ET estimations of 1300 to 1580 mm/year, and that cotton uses more water (1162 mm/year) than corn (838 mm/year) and sorghum (829 mm/year) as expected. Crop water use varies from one irrigation district to another due to differences in soil quality, water quality, and farming practices. Results from our study suggest that the ET maps derived from METRIC can be used to quantify the spatial distribution of ET and to characterize agricultural water use by crop types at different spatial scales.",

The meridional flow is detectable with a variety of methods, including ring-diagram helioseismology. Many of these methods are plagued with systematic errors that have only recently been analyzed in detail. For ring-diagram analysis, the systematic errors introduce a signal that is easily confused with that of the meridional flow and is often of significant amplitude. Accurately determining the character of the solar meridional circulation requires careful attention to these errors. I use observations from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to measure both the meridional flow and the associated systematics.

            "abstract": "We present earthquake site response results from a 48-channel multicomponent seismic land streamer and large weight drop system. We acquired data along a grid of city streets in western Idaho at a rate of a few km per day where we derived shear wave velocity profiles to a depth of 40-50 m by incorporating vertical and radial geophone signals to capture the complete elliptical Rayleigh wave motion. We also obtained robust p-wave reflection and refraction results by capturing the returned signals that arrive at non-vertical incidence angles that result from the high-velocity road surface layer. By integrating the derived shear wave velocity profiles with p-wave reflection results, we include depositional and tectonic boundaries from the upper few hundred meters into our analysis to help assess whether ground motions may be amplified by shallow bedrock. By including p-wave refraction information into the analysis, we can identify zones of high liquefaction potential by comparing shear wave and p-wave velocity (Vp/Vs) measurements relative to refraction-derived water table depths. The utilization of multicomponent land streamer data improves signal-noise levels over single component data with no additional field effort. The added multicomponent data processing step can be as simple as calculating the magnitude of the vector for surface wave and refraction arrivals or rotating the reflected signals to the maximum emergence angle based on near surface p-wave velocity information. We show example data from a number of Idaho communities where historical earthquakes have been recorded. We also present numerical models and systematic field tests that show the effects of a high velocity road surface layer in surface and body wave measurements. We conclude that multicomponent seismic information derived from seismic land streamers can provide a significant improvement in earthquake hazard assessment over a standard single component approach with only a small addition in processing time.",

            "abstract": "The coastal regions of central Beringia contain a well-studied sequence of marine shorelines consisting of barrier beach sequences and broad coastal plans of superposed marine sediment. These sequences include shorelines associated with 2 Pliocene high sea stands, and lower shorelines dated to MIS 31, MIS 11, and MIS 5e. All of these shorelines correspond with super interglacials identified in the Lake El’gygytgyn paleoclimate record (Lake E), NE Arctic Russia. However, not all super interglacials correspond with a recorded high sea level event in the western Arctic. We argue that most of the high sea stands in central and northern Beringia, especially the NW coast of Alaska, likely require at least the partial demise of Greenland, or WAIS, or EAIS, or some combination of the three. How do we evaluate what melted and why?\nMIS 31 was a remarkably warm interval found in the ANDRILL and other marine records around Antarctica. Half a prerecession cycle after this warmth in Antarctica, we see a super interglacial MIS 31 in Lake E. Because of unconformities in the ANDRILL record, MIS 31 still provides the best match with Lake E, but we postulate that other intervals marked by the deposition of diatomaceous ooze in the ANDRILL record may also correspond to many of our interglacials. The challenge has been to determine orbital phasing relationships between warmth in the south and warmth in the north. Here we explore this relationship starting with the striking observation that most super interglacials correspond with extremely low eccentricity, but lagged by ~53kyrs. We explore how orbital conditions may have preconditioned the polar regions to produce a large response during some interglacials; linking changes in polar ice sheet size to sea level and interglacial extremes recorded at Lake E.",

            "abstract": "Urbanization is a demographic trend worldwide. Urban irrigation can exceed natural precipitation and is an important component of the water cycle in water stressed cities. 14-30% of municipal water consumption in California is used for irrigation. Understanding and quantifying the potential influence of urban anthropogenic soil moisture contribution on local and regional hydrological cycle is an imperative step toward sustainable and better-managed water resources in water scarce regions. In the current study we address the impact and feedback of urban irrigation by integrating a developed irrigation scheme within the coupled framework of the WRF-UCM (Urban Canopy Model) over the Los Angeles metropolitan area at 1 km spatial resolution. We focus on the impacts of irrigation on the urban water cycle and atmospheric feedback during the summer period. Our results demonstrate a significant sensitivity of WRF-UCM simulated surface turbulent fluxes to the incorporation of irrigation. Introducing anthropogenic moisture, the vegetated pixels show increased latent heat fluxes and decreased sensible and ground heat fluxes confirming irrigation induced shift in the energy partitioning toward elevated latent heat fluxes. The evaluation of the model performance against ground-based reference evapotranspiration (ET) observations indicates that WRF-UCM, after adding irrigation, performs reasonably during the course of the simulation, tracking day to day variability of ET. In the absence of irrigation, simulated ET values are significantly underestimated. This is due to fact that soil moisture is the only source of water in the absence of significant precipitation. In the course of model spin up, the moisture sorted in the soil layers is consumed, resulting in considerable decreases in the latent heat fluxes. Evaluating the model outputs against MODIS based land surface temperature illustrates that this ET reduction leads to reduced cooling effects of urban vegetation, particularly over fully vegetated and low intensity residential pixels. Results indicate the importance of accurate representation of urban irrigation in water scarce regions. Moreover, it is found that the initial soil moisture level plays a key role in dampening the impacts of irrigation in urban domains and extended spin up is recommended.",

            "abstract": "We present an intercomparison between the water vapour products from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) and the MUlti-platform remote Sensing of Isotopologues for investigating the Cycle of Atmospheric water (MUSICA), two datasets from ground-based Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectrometers with good global representation. Where possible, comparisons to radiosondes are also included.\nThe near-infrared TCCON measurements are optimized to provide precise monitoring of greenhouse gases for carbon cycle studies; however, TCCON’s retrievals also produce water vapour products. The mid-infrared MUSICA products result from retrievals optimized to give precise and accurate information about H2O, HDO, and δD. The MUSICA water vapour products have been validated by extensive intercomparisons with H2O and δD in-situ measurements made from ground, radiosonde, and aircraft (Schneider et al. 2012, 2014), as well as by intercomparisons with satellite-based H2O and δD remote sensing measurements (Wiegele et al., 2014). This dataset provides a valuable reference point for other measurements of water vapour.\nThis study is motivated by the limited intercomparisons performed for TCCON water vapour products and limited characterisation of their uncertainties. We compare MUSICA and TCCON products to assess the potential for TCCON measurements to contribute to studies of the water cycle, water vapour’s role in climate and use as a tracer for atmospheric dynamics, and to evaluate the performance of climate models.\nThe TCCON and MUSICA products result from measurements taken using the same FTIR instruments, enabling a comparison with constant instrumentation. The retrieval techniques differ, however, in their method and a priori information. We assess the impact of these differences and characterize the comparability of the TCCON and MUSICA datasets.",

            "abstract": "Polarity transitions and magnetic excursions have durations of a few thousand years, or less. Transition/excursion records in volcanic sequences are, at best, partial snap-shots of the transition/excursion field. Records from high-sedimentation-rate marine sediments may be more continuous but they are always smoothed by progressive acquisition of detrital remanent magnetization (DRM), and by sampling/measurement limitations. North Atlantic records of the Matuyama-Brunhes (M-B) polarity transition are compared with records of the Iceland Basin excursion (190 ka). Virtual geomagnetic polar (VGP) paths are used to map characteristic magnetization directions during the transition/excursion. Relative paleointensity (RPI) proxies indicate partial recovery of field intensity during the transition/excursion, with RPI minima coinciding with abrupt VGP shifts at the onset and end of the transition/excursion. Discrepancies in VGP paths among holes at the same site, among sites, and a comparison of u-channel and discrete sample measurements, reveal limitations in resolution of the transition/excursion fields. During the M-B polarity transition, VGP clusters appear in the NW Pacific, NE Asia and in the South Atlantic. Similarities in VGP clustering for the M-B boundary and the Iceland Basin excursion imply that the polarity transition and excursion fields had common characteristics. Similarities with the modern non-axial dipole (NAD) field imply that polarity transitions and excursions involve the demise of the Earth’s axial dipole relative to the NAD field, and that the NAD field has long-lasting features locked in place by the lowermost mantle.",

            "abstract": "Recent observations indicate a warming of permafrost in many northern regions with a resulting degradation of ice-rich and carbon-rich permafrost. In the last 30-40 years, warming in permafrost temperatures observed in Northern Eurasia, Canada, and Alaska has resulted in the thawing of permafrost in natural, undisturbed conditions in areas close to the southern boundary of the permafrost zone. The main aim of this study is to evaluate the vulnerability of permafrost under climate warming across the Permafrost Region of the Northern Hemisphere. We applied the process-based permafrost dynamics model GIPL2 (Geophysical Institute Permafrost Lab), using a historical climate forcing CRU3.1 data set for retrospective (1960-2009) and CCSM4 RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (2009-2300) for analysis of permafrost dynamics in the future. We estimated dynamics of the area and volume of seasonally thawed soils within the three upper meters across the entire Permafrost Domain. During the last four decades of the 20th century, the simulated total area and the volume of thawed soils with Active Layer Thickness (ALT) shallower than 3 m has been varying between 11 and 13 million km2, and between 17.3 to 19.4 thousand km3 respectively. Our projections according to the CCSM4 RCP4.5 climate scenario indicate that the maximum unfrozen volume of soil within three upper meters would change between 12.8 and 20.8 thousand km3 during 2009-2300. Despite the slower rate of soil warming in peatland areas and a slower degradation of permafrost under peat soils, a considerable volume of peat (approximately 20% of the total volume of peat in the Northern Hemisphere) could be thawed by the end of the current century and 35% by 2300. The potential release of carbon and the net effect of this thawing will depend on the balance between increased productivity and respiration, and will also depend on soil moisture dynamics.",

            "abstract": "In 2011, heavy winter snow melt combined with extensive spring rains caused the Missouri River to experience the most extensive flooding since the river was dammed in the 1950s. Large sections of the river banks, islands, and floodplains experienced weeks of prolonged inundation, resulting in extensive sand deposition as up to1 km inland from the established channel. Though locally variable, deposits of up to 3m of loose sand were deposited on the floodplain and extensive areas of shrub, grasslands, and agricultural fields were completely buried or had vegetation washed away in the inundation zone. The flooding also created a number of new unvegetated islands which provide important habitat for endangered species including the Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus). These newly created sand surfaces are unconsolidated and have very little vegetation to prevent aeolian transport. Strong sustained regional winds of up to 20m/s (45mph) cause substantial sediment fluxes which modify landscape topography, shift river morphology, and increase regional dust levels.\nOur study monitors and quantifies the increase in aeolian transport that occurred following flooding along the Garrison Reach, a 110 km section of free flowing Missouri River in North Dakota. In 2012 and 2013 we measured sand transport and accumulation rates using Leatherman style sand traps and erosion pins to at 9 sites of varying vegetation densities. We apply these flux rates to a high resolution remote sensing vegetation map to estimate the total flux of sand for this segment of the river. We also quantify total available new sand for transport using repeat Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) coverage from before and after the flood and examine the relationship between sand deposition and the rate of reestablishment of vegetation. All of these results are used to estimate the scale of flood induced aeolian processes and predict where they may continue to influence the landscape.",

            "abstract": "There is strong interest in understanding how run-of-river impoundments affect streams and their floodplains. Most recent work has focused on the fate of sediment within these dammed systems both past and current, the geomorphic impacts associated with sediment, and issues associated with removing run-of-the-river dams. Here, we assess how run-of-river impoundments alter the floodplain effluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4).\nWe sampled two pairs of floodplains on the Red Clay Creek (140 km2) located in the Christina River Basin Critical Zone Observatory. The floodplain pairs were centered on a current and a former location of a run-of-river dam (one floodplain upstream, one downstream of dam location). Each floodplain was subjected to a suite of measurements that included bi-weekly gas flux (CO2, CH4, and H2O), bi-weekly soil moisture and temperature, monthly biomass sampling, C/N ratio sampling from O and A horizons, and cores that constrain the total organic carbon and nitrogen at depth as well as provide a description of the stratigraphy.\nPreliminary findings show that all floodplains are sources of CH4 (0.18 - 1.12 nmol m-2s-1) and CO2 (0.42 – 3.12 µmol m-2s-1). Despite temporal variability, the upstream floodplains produce more CH4 and CO2 than downstream floodplains. Our results may suggest that run-of-the-river dams enhance release of carbon from floodplains into the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Establishing relevance and effective communication are key mechanisms for building student and community engagement in a topic and can be used to promote the importance of working across disciplines to solve problems. Sustainability, including the impacts of and responses to climate change, is an inherently interdisciplinary issue and can be infused across courses and curricula in a variety of ways. Key topics such as climate change, hazards, and food, water, and energy production and sustainability are relevant to a wide audience and can be used to build student engagement. Using real-world examples, service learning, and focusing on the local environment may further boost engagement by establishing relevance between sustainability issues and students' lives.\nCommunication plays a key role in the exchange of information across disciplines and allows for a more holistic approach to tackling the complex climate and sustainability issues our society faces. It has the power to bridge gaps, break down disciplinary silos, and build connections among diverse audiences with a wide range of expertise, including scientists, policy-makers, stakeholders, and the general public. It also aids in planning and preparation for, response to, and mitigation of issues related to sustainability, including the impacts of climate change, to lessen the detrimental effects of unavoidable events such as sea level rise and extreme weather events.\nSeveral workshops from the InTeGrate and On the Cutting Edge projects brought together educators and practitioners from a range of disciplines including geoscience, engineering, social science, and more to encourage communication and collaboration across disciplines. They supported networking, community-building, and sharing of best practices for preparing our students for a sustainable future, both in and out of the workplace, and across disciplines. Interdisciplinary teams are also working together to author curricular materials that highlight societal issues. The InTeGrate Teaching Materials web pages highlight major outcomes from the workshops and feature community-contributed resources and pedagogic guidance designed to enhance teaching about sustainability across disciplines.

            "abstract": "In a given tectonic province and over thousands to millions of years, slip on faults is believed to be constant and approximately equal to the local tectonic rate in agreement with rigid plate tectonic theory. In this model the ductile lower crust flows in response to this steady plate motion. Moreover brittle and ductile behaviors interact only at a sharp boundary defined as the brittle ductile transition (BDT). However in the continental lithosphere brittle and ductile behavior may coexist over a large range of pressure and temperature conditions for different mineral compositions. This generates heterogeneities in the brittle and ductile crust that are often ignored in models of shear zones. We hypothesize that the interaction between brittle (elastic) and ductile (viscous) behavior may cause deviations from steady-state slip and generates transient creep events on shear zones that release many meters of creep over years to thousands of years marked by a single period of tectonic activity followed by quiescence.\nWe present a set of numerical and analytical models, analogue experiments as well as some observations in nature that may support this hypothesis. In this presentation we extend an analytic formulation to model creep events within shear zones at the transition between brittle and ductile behavior in the crust. We assume that creep events are triggered by a set of interconnected fractures modeled as propagating dislocations. The amount of connectivity controls the nature and the intensity of the transient creep events. The shear zone behaves as a forced damped oscillator that can release strain accumulated during jammed/locked periods. The creep can be over-, critically-, or under-damped. The time scale of the events may vary between seconds to thousands of years depending on the viscous, elastic and plastic (fractures) properties of the shear zone.",

            "abstract": "A central challenge in agricultural remote sensing is the detection of changes in intra-annual cropping frequency, often necessary in monitoring crop productivity, agricultural management practices, or policy implementation. Though remote sensing imagery offers synoptic and systematic measurements relevant to monitoring crop phenology across spatial scales, broad-scale (i.e., country-wide) changes in cropping frequency have seldom been quantified due to spatio-temporal heterogeneity in phenological and climatic cycles, signal noise, and missing data resulting from cloud cover. For example, in Zimbabwe, once the breadbasket of southern Africa, large-scale changes to agricultural production followed land distribution policies introduced in the early 2000s. The diverse impacts of land reform on the agricultural economy continue to be debated yet the underlying changes in cropping frequency and pattern have never been systematically assessed. Using Zimbabwean agriculture as a case study and MODIS 16-day composite Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and complementary Landsat imagery collected since 2000 across Zimbabwe, this presentation introduces a novel time-series signal decomposition and spatiotemporal clustering approach to map intra-annual cropping frequency and changes therein. MODIS-derived results indicate a massive decline in double-cropped acreage since 2000, a complete overhaul of cropping pattern with the disaggregation of large-scale commercial farms into multiple smallholder plots, and a spatial contraction of double-cropped fields to peri-urban lands, while Landsat trends capture the recent emergence of small-scale double-cropping systems unseen in MODIS data. These findings provide an independent and objective assessment of field-level changes in agricultural productivity, spatiotemporally explicit land reform effects on large-scale as well as smallholder agriculture and potential for food production, and have importance for regional water consumption, fertilizer use, and agricultural carbon emissions.",

            "abstract": "The southern Ross Sea basin in West Antarctica has been filled up with a complex sedimentary sequence since ~5 Ma containing a mixture of glacial and glacio-marine strata and flexural basin infill. These strata record past climatically influenced advances and retreats of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and the volcanic loading history of Ross Island.\nWe hypothesize that the amplitude of flexural uplift of the seafloor caused by volcanic loading on Ross Island was sufficient to cause fluctuations of the ice grounding line position, creating false positives in the climate change interpretations derived from the nearby ANDRILL AND-1B core data.\nTo test this hypothesis, we model flexural deformation and subsidence due to individual volcanic loading episodes on Ross Island. We constrain this model by three seismic horizons (Rsb1, Rsb2, and Rsb3) imaged on seismic profile NBP0401-126m, which trends radially away from Ross Island and across its flexural moat. The horizons bound wedge shaped strata filling the moat during flexural depositional episodes, and range in depth (age) from 146 m-153 m (~2.1 Ma), 282 m-308 m (~3.0 Ma) and 432 m- 463 m (4.3 ± 0.3 Ma) respectively.\nOur flexure model suggests that AND-1B lies in the flexural moat of the Ross Island flexure basin. Horizons Rsb2 and Rsb3 record the flexural subsidence of the basin during Mt. Bird volcanic loading on Ross Island. Rsb2 and RSb3 correlate with upward changes from diamictites to diatomites and mudstones in the AND-1B stratigraphic record. This lithological change has been interpreted to represent a change from grounded ice to open marine conditions, and a shift in the ice sheet grounding line position. Therefore, our results suggest that the magnitude of flexural subsidence in the flexural moat was sufficient to cause changes from grounded to floating ice at the AND-1B.",

            "abstract": "In May-June 2013, an NSF-funded team from Dartmouth College and the Universities of Maine and New Hampshire collected two 1000-year ice cores to bedrock from the summit plateau of Mount Hunter in Denali National Park, Alaska (62.940291, -151.087616, 3912 m). The snow accumulation record from these ice cores will provide key insight into late Holocene precipitation variability in central Alaska, and compliment existing precipitation paleorecords from the Mt. Logan and Eclipse ice cores in coastal SE Alaska. However, correct interpretation of the Mt. Hunter accumulation record requires an understanding of the relationships between regional meteorological events and micrometeorological conditions at the Mt. Hunter ice core collection site. Here we analyze a three-month window of snow accumulation and meteorological conditions recorded by an Automatic Weather Station (AWS) at the Mt. Hunter site during the summer of 2013. Snow accumulation events are identified in the Mt. Hunter AWS dataset, and compared on a storm-by-storm basis to AWS data collected from the adjacent Kahiltna glacier 2000 m lower in elevation, and to regional National Weather Service (NWS) station data. We also evaluate the synoptic conditions associated with each Mt. Hunter accumulation event using NWS surface maps, NCEP-NCAR Reanalysis data, and the NOAA HYSPLIT back trajectory model. We categorize each Mt. Hunter accumulation event as pure snow accumulation, drifting, or blowing snow events based on snow accumulation, wind speed and temperature data using the method of Knuth et al (2009). We analyze the frequency and duration of events within each accumulation regime, in addition to the overall contribution of each event to the snowpack. Preliminary findings indicate that a majority of Mt. Hunter accumulation events are of pure accumulation nature (55.5%) whereas drifting (28.6%) and blowing (15.4%) snow events play a secondary role. Our results will characterize the local accumulation dynamics on Mt. Hunter and quantify the relationship between alpine micrometeorological and regional precipitation dynamics, providing key insights into the interpretation of the Mt. Hunter paleoprecipitation record.",

            "abstract": "A recurring demand in working with satellite-based earth science data records is the need to apply data quality information. Such quality information is often contained within the data files as an array of “flags”, but can also be represented by more complex quality descriptions such as combinations of bit flags, or even other ancillary variables indicating thresholds to be applied to the geophysical variable of interest. For example, with Level 2 granules from the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) project up to 6 independent variables can be used to screen the sea surface temperature measurements on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Quality screening of Level 3 data from the upcoming Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) instrument can be become even more complex, involving 26 unique bit states or conditions a user can screen for. The application of quality information is often a laborious process until the user understands the implications of all the flags and bit conditions, and requires iterative approaches using custom software. In addition, most visualization packages do not understand how to apply quality information.\nThe Virtual Quality Screening Service, a recently funded 2013 NASA ACCESS project, aims to address these issues and concerns. The project will develop an infrastructure to expose, apply, and extract quality screening information, building off known and proven NASA components for data extraction and subset-by-value, implementations of Map Reduce workflows, data discovery, ontologies and exposure to the user of granule-based quality information. Further sharing of results through well defined URLs and visualization capabilities will also be described. The presentation will focus on overall description of the technologies and informatics principals employed by the project, and recent results and infrastructure status. Examples of implementations of the end-to-end web service for quality screening with GHRSST and SMAP granules will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "During several recent field campaigns including GoAmazon2014, ambient gases and particles were exposed to controlled concentrations of OH, O3 or NO3 in-situ using a Potential Aerosol Mass oxidation flow reactor. Oxidant exposure in the reactor ranged from an hour to several weeks of equivalent atmospheric residence time, allowing the study of SOA formation and chemistry over long time scales. Oxidized air from the reactor was sampled directly (e.g., HR-AMS, ACSM, PTR-TOFMS, SMPS, CCN), and these results were compared with collocated biogenic and anthropogenic tracers (e.g., SV-TAG sesquiterpenes and PTR-TOFMS aromatics, isoprene, and monoterpenes). In all studies, OH oxidation of ambient air in the reactor led to substantial SOA mass production (often several µg/m3 of SOA) during times of high precursor gas concentrations. While SOA production correlated with measured gas-phase precursors, the total mass formed in the reactor was generally several times larger than could be explained by the aerosol yields of measured VOC’s. This suggests that a majority of gases that formed SOA in the reactor were not the primary VOCs considered as traditional SOA precursors. Additionally, most of the SOA mass increase occurred in the first day of equiv. atmospheric aging, suggesting that ambient SOA is predominantly formed close to emission sources of precursors with gas-phase reaction lifetimes of <1 day. At a remote Colorado pine forest site (during BEACHON-RoMBAS), the mainly biogenic aerosol formed in the reactor from <1 equivalent day of oxidation had an atomic O:C of 0.54, similar to the existing ambient aerosol O:C of 0.61. As OH exposures increased (up to 10-20 equivalent days), the OA became highly oxidized (O:C>1) and partially revolatilized, demonstrating the competing effects of functionalization/condensation at low exposures vs. fragmentation/evaporation reactions for high exposures. SOA formation from O3 and NO3 oxidation correlated with biogenic gas-phase precursors, but led to smaller (<0.5 µg/m3) SOA production, consistent with the ability for OH to achieve more generations of oxidation than O3 or NO3. Measurements taken in a variety of biogenic ecosystems with a wide range of anthropogenic influence were compared, allowing investigation of the effects of anthropogenic pollution on SOA formation.",

            "abstract": "Wind-driven divergence of ocean currents in the eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP) gives rise to strong upwelling of cold, nutrient- and CO2-rich deep waters, contributing to high primary productivity in this region. Every 2-7 years, ceased upwelling in the EEP during El Niño events impact global climate through the El Niño – Southern Oscillation teleconnections. High productivity in the EEP also strongly influences the global carbon cycle and the cycling of important nutrients. Yet the geological history of the equatorial upwelling system is unclear. One hypothesis argues that before 3 Ma, the thermocline in the EEP was so deep that upwelling was effectively shut down. This proposition is supported by SST reconstructions that show a much warmer EEP over the late Miocene – Pliocene. However, high mass accumulation rates (MAR) of biogenic opal throughout the entire EEP has been observed over 4.5-6.7 Ma, suggesting abundant nutrient supply probably associated with strong upwelling.\nHere we report a novel approach to probe the strength of equatorial upwelling using seawater CO2 reconstructions. Shipboard surveys show that during normal (upwelling) or La Niña (strong upwelling) conditions, surface seawater in the EEP has a much higher CO2 content than atmospheric conditions. However, during El Niño events when rates of upwelling are nearly absent, CO2(sw) is close to air-sea equilibrium. CO2(sw) data collected near ODP Site 850 in the EEP demonstrate a strong correlation between excess CO2 and the Nino3 index. For this study, we apply CO2 reconstructions using the alkenone-pCO2 method from Site 850 and Site 806 in the Pacific warm pool to compute excess CO2 since ~6 Ma, assuming that Site 806 reflects air-sea equilibrium in CO2. Our results show that the surface seawater at Site 850 always contains more CO2 than Site 806, indicating a prevailing upwelling history in the EEP for the past 6 million years. Applying the modern excess CO2-Nino 3 index relationships, we show that upwelling was probably strongest during the late Miocene – early Pliocene, coinciding with the highest MAR of biogenic opal, and then declined over the Plio-Pleistocene. These results suggest that the warm EEP SSTs in the Miocene – Pliocene reflect warmer source waters and those SSTs is no adequate indicator of upwelling intensity during this time interval.",

            "abstract": "Flash floods commonly cause rapid gully erosion, creating headwalls that erode into previously stable surfaces, thereby reducing arable land and releasing sediment that can contaminate water supplies. In semi-arid landscapes, gully erosion tends to be driven by flash floods. Here, we study the mechanisms for flash-flood generation, seeking to answer two questions: (1) how spatially variable is runoff production, and (2) what combination of rainfall intensity and duration is required to produce runoff? To answer these questions, we combine field data from a study site on the Colorado High Plains, USA, with numerical modeling. The site is characterized by patchy, dryland shrub vegetation dispersed throughout the otherwise bare slopes and gullies. Analysis of six years of rainfall and runoff data indicate that flash flood generation requires a 15-minute intensity of approximately 38 mm/hr. Sprinkler experiments on isolated bare and vegetated plots revealed a large contrast between infiltration capacities: bare areas can produce runoff when the rainfall exceeds 10-15 mm/hr, whereas vegetated areas permit infiltration of at least 45 mm/hr during relatively brief, intense events. These findings imply that high-intensity rainstorms associated with summertime moist convective systems drive gully incision. They also suggest that a self-enhancing feedback may exist in which initial incision creates steep and relatively bare slopes that tend to generate more runoff, leading to more aggressive gully incision.",

We find that the local reconnection rate is reduced in regions where the plume impinges on the dayside magnetopause, though less than predicted by the Cassak-Shay theory. In simulations without a plasmasphere, the theory tends to overestimate the reconnection rate, thereby predicting a stronger reduction in the rate of merging when plasmapheric mass is introduced. We also find that the dayside reconnection potential is reduced, though the effect is less than would be predicted with more uniform loading of mass inside the magnetosphere. This suggests that both the location and spatial extent of plasmapheric plumes play important roles in determining the degree to which dayside reconnection activity is reduced by magnetospheric mass loading.",

            "abstract": "Two of the most striking changes occurring in the Arctic over the past decade are the decline in sea ice extent and increased mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS). From an Arctic system perspective, the physical linkages between sea ice extent and the GrIS mass loss remain to be explored with the results from previous research pointing to a correlation between these two processes. In this study, we assess the relationship between sea ice concentration variability and its extremes and both local and large-scale forcing of ocean heat and moisture advection on the GrIS. To this aim, we employ a variety of tools and datasets such as the outputs of a regional climate model (Modèle Atmosphérique Régional, MAR), surface wind observations, and reanalysis data. In particular, we test the hypothesis that sea ice extent variability influences GrIS surface energy and mass balance through oceanic heat advection and focus on understanding the physical processes involved. Using the outputs of a 35-year (1979–2014) simulation from the MAR model, we examine the spatiotemporal co-variability of the heat and moisture fluxes over ocean (divided regions based on latitude) with sea ice concentration (SIC) against the same fluxes over the GrIS during the five highest and lowest SIC years, as estimated from satellite and reanalysis datasets. We then report a comparative analysis of simulated changes in wind for high and low SIC years against weather-station observations to determine surface wind height—in this case, katabatic wind height—relative to the depth of moisture transport in the boundary layer. Lastly, we focus on the influence of large-scale upper level circulation, such as 500-hPa eddy heat fluxes and the known modes of atmospheric variability (e.g. the Greenland Blocking Index.)",

            "abstract": "Interglacials are the warm, minimum ice, high sea level end-member of the glacial climate cycles of the Pleistocene, with the present Holocene period as the most recent example. We have identified 11 interglacial intervals in the last 800 ka and have reviewed their occurrence, intensity, shape and timing, including the processes that accompany deglaciation and glacial inception. Our compilation of evidence from marine, terrestrial and ice core climate archives suggests that, despite spatial inhomogeneity, marine isotope stages (MIS) 5 and 11 were globally strong (warm), while MIS 13 tended to be cool. A step change in strength of interglacials at ~450 ka (mid-Brunhes) is apparent only in CO2, and Antarctic and deep ocean temperature. The onset of interglacials (deglaciation or glacial “termination”) is relatively rapid, and seems to require a combination of low orbital precession (high northern hemisphere summer insolation) and the existence of a large ice sheet. Terminations involve highly non-linear interactions of ocean and atmospheric dynamics, sea level, CO2 and temperature, along with the imposed external insolation forcing. The precise timing appears to be closely tied to the fall in precession but may be modulated by millennial scale climate variability that determines the pattern of change seen in temperature in each hemisphere. There is some organized variability and a range of climatic trends within interglacials, resulting in intensity maxima that may occur either early or late in different instances. The end of interglacials (glacial inception) is typically a slower process involving a global sequence of changes. Interglacials are typically 10-30 ka long. Proposed analogs do not easily inform us about the natural progression or length of the current interglacial, but due to a combination of reduced insolation variability and greenhouse gas concentrations the timing of the next glacial inception appears to be many tens of millennia in the future.",

            "abstract": "Mixed-land use watersheds are often a complex patchwork of forested, agricultural, and urban land-uses where differential land-use mediated non-point source pollution can significantly impact water quality. Stream nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations serve as important variables for quantifying land use effects on non-point source pollution in receiving waters and relative impacts on aquatic biota. The Hinkson Creek Watershed (HCW) is a representative mixed land use urbanizing catchment (231 km2) located in central Missouri, USA. A nested-scale experimental watershed study including five permanent hydroclimate stations was established in 2009 to provide quantitative understanding of multiple land use impacts on nutrient loading. Spectrophotometric analysis was used to quantify total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) and total phosphorus (TP as PO4) regimes. Results (2010 – 2013) indicate average nitrate (NO3-) concentration (mg/l) range of 0.28 to 0.46 mg/l, nitrite (NO2-) range of 0.02 to 0.03 mg/l, ammonia (NH3) ranged from 0.04 to 0.08 mg/l, and TP range of 0.26 to 0.39 mg/l. With n=858, NO3-, NO2-, NH3, and TP concentrations were significantly (CI=95%, p=0.00) higher in the subbasin with the greatest percent cumulative agricultural land use (57%). NH3 and TP concentrations were significantly (CI=95%, p=0.00) higher (with the exception of the agricultural subbasin) in the subbasin with the greatest percent cumulative urban land use (26%). Results from multiple regression analyses showed percent cumulative agricultural and urban land uses accounted for 85% and 96% of the explained variance in TIN loading (CI=95%, p=0.08) and TP loading (CI=95%, p=0.02), respectively, between gauging sites. These results improve understanding of agricultural and urban land use impacts on nutrient concentrations in mixed use watersheds of the Midwest and have implications for nutrient reduction programs in the Mississippi River Basin and hypoxia reductions in the Gulf of Mexico, USA.",

            "abstract": "The mantle transition zone (TZ) is believed to be primarily composed of three constituents: wadsleyite, ringwoodite, and majorite garnet (Ringwood, 1975). Laboratory sound velocity measurements for wadsleyite and ringwoodite alone are too high to match TZ seismological models (Li et al., Science, 1998; Sinogeikin et al., JGR, 1998), while majorite yields significantly lower sound velocities (Sinogeikin et al., GRL, 2002; Gwanmesia et al., PEPI, 2009). Taken together, a compositional model such as pyrolite yields a good fit to seismology within uncertainties, with the major discrepancies being that pyrolite yields slightly larger velocity jumps and shallower velocity gradients than seismology (Li and Liebermann, Science, 2007; Irifune et al., Nature, 2008). Hydration of ringwoodite in the transition zone is expected to reduce seismic velocities. If the lower part of the TZ is hydrated, as some recent studies suggest (Pearson et al., Nature, 2014; Schmandt et al., Science, 2014), the proportions of ringwoodite and majoritic garnet in the TZ should be re-evaluated.\nVelocity gradients in the TZ are likely related to the gradual eclogite-garnetite transition. Over the TZ pressure range (~13-24 GPa), the dissolution of pyroxene into garnet gradually increases, resulting in a complex depth-varying garnet-majorite solid solution, ranging from M4Si4O12 majorite (Mj) to M3Al2Si3O12 garnet (Gt), where M is Mg, Fe, Ca0.5Mg0.5, etc. (Akaogi and Akimoto, PEPI, 1977; Bina and Wood, GRL, 1984; Gasparik, CMP, 1989). Several studies have considered the compositional dependence of majoritic garnet elastic moduli (Liu et al., PEPI, 2000; Sinogeikin et al., EPSL, 2002; Sinogeikin and Bass, GRL, 2002; Murakami et al., EPSL, 2008), but few have considered both composition and hydration state under the high-pressure and high-temperature conditions of the TZ. Here we combine in situ X-ray and Brillouin measurements to determine the elastic constants of various majoritic garnet compositions under pressure and temperature conditions of the TZ, up to 25 GPa and 1000°C. The elastic moduli dependence on composition and hydration of majorite garnet are of first-order importance when seeking to constrain mineralogical models of the mantle.",

These charged particles can affect electronics on spacecraft, airplanes, global positioning systems, and communication satellites. The purpose of this research was to study CME data from satellites and correlate these to other properties.\nSolar wind data collected by STEREO A/B and ACE satellites were analyzed. The data consisted of solar wind flux for various elements (helium through iron), as well as the components of the interplanetary magnetic field. CME events are known to cause a surge in the helium flux, as well as other particles. It is hypothesized that a CME event will cause an increase in the number of lighter elements relative to heavier particles. This is because for a given input of energy, lighter elements are expected to be accelerated to a greater extent than heavier elements.\nA significant increase was observed in the ratio between helium to oxygen (He/O) prior to intense CMEs. A CME event on November 4, 2003 caused an eleven-fold increase in the He/O ratio, while for another event on April 2, 2001 the He/O ratio increased from 80 to 700. A significant increase in He/O ratio is not observed during weaker CMEs. Furthermore, it was also observed that not all increases in the ratio were accompanied by CMEs. The increase in He/O ratio prior to the CME arrival might be used as a way to predict future events.",

            "abstract": "Despite many injuries and deaths each year worldwide, no analytically rigorous attempt exists to characterize and quantify the dangers to boaters, swimmers, fishermen, and other river enthusiasts. While designed by expert boaters, the International Scale of River Difficulty provides a whitewater classification that uses qualitative descriptions and subjective scoring. The purpose of this study was to develop an objective characterization of in-channel hazard dangers across spatial scales from a single boulder to an entire river segment for application over a wide range of discharges and use in natural hazard assessment and mitigation, recreational boating safety, and river science. A process-based conceptualization of river hazards was developed, and algorithms were programmed in R to quantify the associated dangers. Danger indicators included the passage proximity and reaction time posed to boats and swimmers in a river by three hazards: emergent rocks, submerged rocks, and hydraulic jumps or holes. The testbed river was a 12.2 km mixed bedrock-alluvial section of the upper South Yuba River between Lake Spaulding and Washington, CA in the Sierra Mountains. The segment has a mean slope of 1.63%, with 8 reaches varying from 1.07% to 3.30% slope and several waterfalls. Data inputs to the hazard analysis included sub-decimeter aerial color imagery, airborne LIDAR of the river corridor, bathymetric data, flow inputs, and a stage-discharge relation for the end of the river segment. A key derived data product was the location and configuration of boulders and boulder clusters as these were potential hazards. Two-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling was used to obtain the meter-scale spatial pattern of depth and velocity at discharges ranging from baseflow to modest flood stages. Results were produced for four discharges and included the meter-scale spatial pattern of the passage proximity and reaction time dangers for each of the three hazards investigated. These results were plotted to yield longitudinal danger profiles and aggregated at site, reach, and segment scales. As discharge increased, the areal fractions of the passage proximity and reaction time dangers within the river showed a monotonic increase and decrease for holes and emergent rocks, respectively, while submerged rocks exhibited a humped trend.",

Designed to observe the precipitable-sized particles, GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) is used in this study to infer ice crystal orientation inside ice clouds. By identifying ice cloud scenes using the 183.3±3 GHz channel, we compare the 89 and 166 GHz radiances for their V-H differences. Ice cloud crystals are found highly polarized with V-H > 0 throughout the tropics and the mid-latitude jet regions. The V-H difference can be as large as 10% (5%) of the mean radiance at 166 GHz (89 GHz). The largest values generally occur over convective outflows, but decreasing in the vicinity of deep convective cores and remote thin cirrus regions. The negative V-H values prominently happen in the equator side of the winter hemisphere storm track regions.\nA polarized radiative transfer model is employed to interpret the observed polarization. Simulations with systematically oriented non-spherical ice particles can reproduce the observed V-H differences, while spherical or randomly oriented non-spherical particles cannot. This finding suggests that accurate cloud ice retrievals must take into account ice crystal orientation. The observed V-H relationship with cloud regimes may relate with vertical velocity, in-cloud turbulence, lightning, and other physical processes, which will be briefly discussed in this presentation.",

            "abstract": "The Midlatitude Continental Convective Clouds Experiment (MC3E) was a collaborative campaign led by the National Aeronautic and Space Administration’s (NASA’s) Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program. This campaign was held at the DOE ARM Southern Great Plains (SGP) Central Facility (CF) in north-central Oklahoma, with the programs joining forces to deploy an extensive array of airborne, radiosonde and ground-based instrumentation towards an unprecedented set of deep convective environment and cloud property observations. An overarching motivation was to capitalize on the wealth of aircraft observations and new multi-frequency dual-polarization radars to provide insights for improving the treatments of cloud processes in convective models.   This study considers a coupled aircraft, radar and surface disdrometer approach for identifying key cloud processes and linking those to possible radar-based microphysical fingerprints and/or cloud properties. Our emphasis is on the MC3E observations collected during aircraft spirals over the column of the ARM CF. We focus on those spirals associated with radar ‘bright band’ signatures and Doppler spectral anomalies observed within trailing stratifrom precipitation. Two cases are highlighted, one following a weaker convective event, and one following a stronger squall line. For each event, we investigate the usefulness of radar to inform on processes including aggregation and riming as viewed by the vertically-pointing ARM wind profiler (915 MHz) and cloud radar Doppler spectral observations (35 GHz). Matching dual-polarization radar signatures from nearby cm-wavelength radar are also consulted for complementary insights. For one event, the successive Citation II aircraft spirals through the melting layer and associated ground observations indicate a fortunate capture of the transition from a region of riming to one favoring aggregation processes more typical of the event.",

Urbanization and climate change influence these fluxes by altering the hydrologic regime, water temperature, and anthropogenic sources of organic matter. Here, we quantify export and metabolism of carbon in highly urbanized, coastal watersheds, and evaluate the importance of physical drivers linked to climate and land use. Using a combination of discrete-samples, continuous water quality sensors, lab experiments, and modeling, we quantified rates of DOC, DIC, and CO2 export as well as changes in DOC quality and in-stream metabolism in four highly developed watersheds of the Chesapeake Bay over three years. Annual DOC and DIC exports from the four watersheds varied from 9 to 23 and 19 to 59 Kg ha-1yr-1 respectively. The range of daily CO2 concentrations was 0.01 to 2.6mg L-1, equivalent to between 0.37 and 53% of daily DOC export across all streams and dates. All sites were net-heterotrophic for the majority of the year (NEP<0), with strong peaks in gross primary production and net autotrophy (NEP >0) during spring and early summer. There was a significant (P<0.05) relationship between gross primary production and ecosystem respiration, suggesting that autotrophic respiration is an important fraction of ER, and labile algal biomass may influence oxygen demand downstream. Our results suggest that urban watersheds can export significant amounts of DOC, DIC, and CO2 to coastal zones. The influence of urbanization on coastal water quality and greenhouse gases may be exacerbated by climate change as temperatures and storm frequency continue to rise.",

The Texas High Plains (THP) leads the US with >890,000 ha enrolled in CRP. Potential benefits of the CRP include, e.g., increased infiltration of rainfall and organic matter, and better soil structure. However, impact of these benefits is not well characterized. Participation in the CRP is done via contracts (10-15 years in length) and since its inception land area of the THP enrolled in CRP has varied significantly allowing the evaluation of years of enrollment (age) on soil structure and impact on rain infiltration. This information is critical for land users to determine how long it is necessary to enroll their land in the CRP to improve soil structure and impact rain infiltration and increase the water holding capacity of the soil. Stable isotopes of water present a useful technique that is used in ecology and hydrology to study water movement through ecosystems and can be used to evaluate the depth of infiltration of rainwater under CRP management. We compared the infiltration depth of rain in land under CRP management to land under continuous dryland cotton with no irrigation. Two locations, in Terry and Lynn counties, were used for this study. The site in Terry County was enrolled in CRP for 25 years (1985) and 22 years (1992) in Lynn County.",

            "abstract": "The design of effective management policies for socioenvironmental systems requires the development of comprehensive, yet sufficiently simple, decision support systems (DSS) for policy makers. Guatemala is a particularly complex case, combining an enormous diversity of climates, geographies, and agroecosystems within a very small geographical scale. Although food insecurity levels are very high, indicating a generally inadequate management of the varied agroecosystems of the country, different regions have shown vastly different trends in food insecurity over the past decade, including between regions with similar geophysical and climatic characteristics and/or governmental programmes (e.g., agricultural support). These observations suggest two important points: firstly, that not merely environmental conditions but rather socio-environmental interactions play a crucial role in the successful management of human-environmental systems, and, secondly, that differences in the geophysical and climatic environments between the diverse regions significantly impact the success or failure of policies.\nThis research uses participatory systems dynamic modelling (SDM) to build a DSS that allows local decision-makers to (1) determine the impact of current and potential policies on agroecosystem management and food security, and (2) design sustainable and resilient policies for the future. The use of participatory SDM offers several benefits, including the active involvement of the end recipients in the development of the model, greatly increasing its acceptability; the integration of physical (e.g., precipitation, crop yield) and social components in one model; adequacy for modelling long-term trends in response to particular policy decisions; and the inclusion of local stakeholder knowledge on system structure and trends through the participatory process. Preliminary results suggest that there is a set of common variables explaining the generally high levels of food insecurity in Guatemala (e.g., agricultural productivity), while others (e.g., land dynamics and access to water resources) are restricted to certain regions and have a relatively important weight in determining the success or failure of policies in these regions.",

            "abstract": "Spatial and temporal variability of specific discharge is rarely measured at the small-catchment-scale and is commonly ignored by most studies which instead assume spatially uniform specific discharge. This assumption is convenient but can lead to fundamentally wrong results, e.g., when calculating solute fluxes at the catchment scale. Pioneering work on 14, partly nested, sub-catchments in a boreal meso-scale (67 km2) catchment in Northern Sweden revealed substantial spatial and temporal variations in both the magnitude and timing of specific discharge. We explore the structure of this variability and its connection to the landscape characteristics using a 5-year gap filled time series of continuous flow records.\nFor the long term (5 years) flow magnitudes for the various sub-catchments varied between 73 % and 132 % relative to the flow at the main outlet, with higher flows from wetland dominated catchments (Spearman rank correlation R=0.81). Looking at seasonal and short term flows, both more pronounced variability and stronger links to different landscape properties are seen. Spring flood magnitudes were correlated (R=0.61 to 0.80) with wet areas, while summer flows were negatively correlated to catchment tree volumes (R=-0.61 to -0.75) and potential evaporation (R=-0.48 to -0.78).\nOn shorter timescales, from daily to monthly, also other catchment properties explained the observed spatial discharge variability. During dry periods of low summer baseflows, sub-catchments with deep fluvial deposits maintained a higher discharge than catchments with shallow soils. This pattern was reversed during summer stormflow events.\nThe results show that there is a spatial structure in the specific discharge and that this structure is temporally variable. Different landscape characteristics influence the flows at different time scales, and the spatiotemporal discharge variability depends on seasonal climatic variability. The observed structure does not only influence mass balance calculations, but also provides insights into spatial and temporal variability of different runoff generation processes.",

            "abstract": "There are many sources of uncertainty regarding the future projections of our climate, including the multiple possible Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), the variety of climate models used, and the initial and boundary conditions with which they are run. Moreover, it has been shown that the internal variability of the climate system can sometimes be of the same order of magnitude as the climate change signal or even larger for some variables. Nonetheless, in order to help inform stakeholders in water resources and agriculture in North America when developing adaptation strategies, particularly for extreme events such as droughts and heat waves, it is necessary to study the plausible range of changes that the region might experience during the 21st century. We aim to understand and reduce the uncertainties associated with this range of possible scenarios by focusing on the diversity of climate models involved in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Data output from various CMIP5 models is compared against near surface climate and land-surface hydrological data from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS)-2 to evaluate how well each climate model represents the land-surface processes associated with droughts and heat waves during the overlapping historical period (1979-2005). These processes include the representation of precipitation and radiation and their partitioning at the land surface, land-atmosphere interactions, and the propagation of signals of these extreme events through the land surface. The ability of the CMIP5 models to reproduce these important physical processes for regions of North America is used to inform a multi-model ensemble in which models that represent the processes relevant to droughts and heat waves better are given more importance. Furthermore, the future projections are clustered to identify possible dependencies in behavior across models. The results indicate a wide range in performance for the historical runs with some models hampered by poor interannual variability in summer precipitation and near surface air temperature, whilst others partition too much precipitation into evapotranspiration with implications for drought and heat wave development.",

An important step in this process is also quantification of uncertainties.\nWe present a spatially explicit and highly resolved emissions inventory for Salt Lake County, Utah, and trace gas concentration estimates for carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and fine particles (PM2.5) within Salt Lake City. We assess the validity of this approach by comparing measured concentrations against simulated values derived from combining the emissions inventory with an atmospheric model.\nThe emissions inventory for the criteria pollutants was constructed using the 2011 National Emissions Inventory (NEI). The spatial and temporal allocation methods from the Emission Modeling Clearinghouse data set are used to downscale the NEI data from annual to hourly scales and from county-level to 500 m x 500 m resolution. Onroad mobile source emissions were estimated by combining a bottom-up emissions calculation approach for large roadway links with a top-down spatial allocation approach for other roadways. Vehicle activity data for road links were derived from automatic traffic responder data. The emissions inventory for CO2 was obtained from the Hestia emissions data product at an hourly, building, facility, and road link resolution.\nThe AERMOD and CALPUFF dispersion models were used to transport emissions and estimate air pollutant concentrations at an hourly temporal and 500 m x 500 m spatial resolution. Modeled results were compared against measurements from a mobile lab equipped with trace gas measurement equipment traveling on pre-determined routes in the Salt Lake City area. The comparison between both approaches to concentration estimation highlights spatial locations and hours of high variability/uncertainty.\nResults presented here will inform understanding of variability and uncertainty in emissions and concentrations to better inform future policy. This work will also facilitate the development of a systematic approach to incorporate measurement data and models to better inform estimates of pollutant concentrations that determine the extent to which urban populations are exposed to adverse air quality.",

These include Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 5e, 9c and 11c. Little is known about past sea surface temperatures (SST) during these warm intervals in the Southern Hemisphere, particularly along the Peru-Chile Current (PCC) which plays a critical role in the Southern Hemisphere surface circulation as it connects the low and high latitudes by transporting sub-polar water masses and thus, a high-latitude climate signal towards the tropics. Here, we present new high-resolution alkenone-derived SST records from marine sediment cores located beneath the PCC.\nCore GeoB15016 was recovered from off northern Chile (27.5°S; 71.1°W) with the seafloor drill rig MARUM-MeBo. We analyzed the ca. 60 meters composite depth complemented by gravity core GeoB3375-1 (27.5°S; 71.3°W) for the upper part to generate a continuous record that extends back to 970 ka BP. Our record is the first continuous SST reconstruction from the Chilean margin extending back to MIS 25. SST varies between ~8°C and ~20°C over the past ~970 ka. Glacial-interglacial SST amplitudes are in the order of 6°C (see Groeneveld’s et al. contribution for Mg/Ca-derived Glacial SST estimations). During MIS 5e, 7e, 9c and 11c, the record reaches SST maxima which are ca. 3ºC warmer than present annual mean SST in the area. Our results suggest a substantial warming of the PCC over past interglacials that may reflect reduced advection of subantarctic surface water from the south and/or enhanced tropical influence from the north.",

Multiple ground-based electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) imagers were positioned at Venetie, Alaska and aimed along magnetic zenith in order to observe the brightness of different auroral emission lines (427.8, 557.7, and 844.6 nm with a 47 degree field of view) at the magnetic footpoint of the payload, near apogee.

            "abstract": "Pan-continental droughts, or droughts that simultaneously affect a large percentage of the geographically and climatically distinct regions of North America, present significant on-the-ground management challenges and, as such, are an important target for scientific research. There are, however, two fundamental reasons why a comprehensive characterization of pan-continental droughts, and their causes, proves challenging: 1) Regional hydroclimate in North America is characterized by distinct atmosphere-ocean dynamics; 2) The relative rarity of pan-continental drought and the short (~150 year) observational record mean that there are few events by which to diagnose how these relatively distinct regional hydroclimate dynamics can combine to produce pan-continental drought. The paradigm of model-data comparisons on paleoclimatic timescales is used herein to extend the North American drought record and to simulate potential atmosphere-ocean states during pan-continental droughts, which together provide a more comprehensive understanding of pan-continental drought dynamics. Specifically, six forced transient simulations of the last millennium from the CMIP5/PMIP3 archives are analyzed in conjunction with gridded tree-ring reconstructions of hydroclimate variability from the North American Drought Atlas (NADA). Models are found to simulate pan-continental drought with the frequency and spatial patterns exhibited by the NADA. They do not, however, agree on the modes of atmosphere-ocean variability that produce pan-continental droughts. This is because simulated ENSO, PDO and AMO dynamics, and their teleconnections to North America, are different between models and observations. Despite these dynamical differences, models are also able to reproduce large-magnitude centennial-scale variability in the frequency of pan-continental drought occurrence—an important feature of the paleoclimate record. These changes do not appear to be tied to exogenous forcings, suggesting that simulated internal hydroclimate variability on these timescales is large in magnitude. Results both clarify understanding of the dynamics that produce real-world pan-continental droughts, while assessing the ability of models to accurately characterize future drought risks.",

            "abstract": "SURFEX/ISBA-Crocus is a physically based multi-layer snowpack model used for numerous scientific and operational applications such as avalanche risk forecast. Although some snowpack models simulations usually performed reasonably well, differences with real snowpack still exist and may be due to various origins such as weather forcing input. Yet, no snow observations are assimilated into the snow model SURFEX/ISBA-Crocus so that the simulation error is accumulated over the winter season. Some efforts will be done to assimilate data from visible and near-infrared imagers into the snowpack model to improve the snowpack simulations. The new optical scheme of SURFEX/ISBA-Crocus, called TARTES, allows the use of reflectance as diagnostic variables of the model. These reflectance are sensitive to snow properties such as specific surface area (SSA) and impurity content. They are measured by the MODIS spectroradiometer and can thus be used in an assimilation framework to account for the high spatial and temporal variability of the snow cover in mountainous areas. Prior to assimilation, we used ensemble methods to find the best assimilation scheme to be implemented. The distribution of model errors is investigated together with the relationship between simulated reflectance and model prognostic variables (density, SSA, …). First tests of reflectance assimilation were then carried out using a particle filter and MODIS measurements at Col du Lautaret (French Alps). The impact of the assimilation has been evaluated in terms of simulated snow properties.",

            "abstract": "The Los Alamos National Laboratory is conducting a research project to understand the physical mechanisms behind the Las Conchas Fire that occurred in Santa Fe National Forest near Los Alamos, New Mexico on June 26, 2011. Between 8 pm on June 26 and 3 am on June 27, the fire grew from 8,000 to 43,000 acres, spreading downhill in sparse fuels and lighter winds than were present during the first several hours of the fire. Fire behavior experts and fire management officers expected the fire to reach 9,000 to 12,000 acres by sunrise due to the anticipated burning conditions, but it actually increased 440% in size before 3 am, surprising everyone. One viable hypothesis was suggested for this baffling fire behavior: a partial collapse of the soot-laden pyrocumulus column (pyro-cu) that towered above the fire, causing a sustained density current carrying fire at high speed. Moreover, another mechanism has been suggested recently that could have significantly affected the fire characteristics around mountainous regions, such as Jemez Mountains near Los Alamos: the drastic changes in the speed, direction, and gustiness of the winds due to the development of mountain waves. The present research tests these hypotheses and attempts to decipher the combination of environmental conditions, due to pyro-cu and mountain wave interactions, and fire behavior dynamics associated with this anomalous wildfire event. Preliminary results from WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting model) and HIGRAD (High-GRADient model developed at LANL) simulations suggest that these two mechanisms may need to be taken into account in order to fully understand and prepare for atypical wildfire behavior in regions with complex topography. It is possible that the Las Conchas Fire could have directly affected the nearby Los Alamos National Laboratory if the fire broke out concurrently with both pyro-cu and strong mountain waves along the upstream of the Laboratory. This research also addresses its implications for the management as well as the research of wildfire in that, in order to prepare for potential wildfire, the topography of the surrounding region as well as the region of importance itself should be taken into account.",

            "abstract": "Coastal fog modifies the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic properties of California watersheds with the greatest impact to ecosystem functioning during arid summer months. Lowered maximum temperatures resulting from inland penetration of marine fog are probably adequate to capture fog effects on thermal land surface characteristics however the hydrologic impact from lowered rates of evapotranspiration due to shade, fog drip, increased relative humidity, and other factors associated with fog events are more difficult to gauge. Fog products, such as those derived from National Weather Service Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) imagery, provide high frequency (up to 15 min) views of fog and low cloud cover and can potentially improve water balance models. Even slight improvements in water balance calculations can benefit urban water managers and agricultural irrigation. The high frequency of GOES output provides the opportunity to explore options for integrating fog frequency data into water balance models. This pilot project compares GOES-derived fog frequency intervals (6, 12 and 24 hour) to explore the most useful for water balance models and to develop model-relevant relationships between climatic and water balance variables. Seasonal diurnal thermal differences, plant ecophysiological processes, and phenology suggest that a day/night differentiation on a monthly basis may be adequate. To explore this hypothesis, we examined discharge data from stream gages and outputs from the USGS Basin Characterization Model for runoff, recharge, potential evapotranspiration, and actual evapotranspiration for the Russian River Watershed under low, medium, and high fog event conditions derived from hourly GOES imagery (1999-2009). We also differentiated fog events into daytime and nighttime versus a 24-hour compilation on a daily, monthly, and seasonal basis. Our data suggest that a daily time-step is required to adequately incorporate the hydrologic effect of fog.",

These interactions provide opportunities for the results and discoveries of federally funded research projects, along with their implications for society, to reach non-scientist audiences. This is especially important for climate, ocean, and environmental science research that will aid citizens in better understanding how they affect Earth’s systems and how these systems affect their daily lives. The National Centers for Ocean Sciences Excellence (COSEE) Network has over 12 years of experience in conducting successful broader impact activities and has provided thousands of ocean scientists the opportunity to share the fruits of their research well beyond the scientific enterprise. COSEE evaluators and principal investigators collaborated over several years to determine the impacts of COSEE broader impact activities and to identify best practices. The lessons learned by the ocean science community can help to inform other disciplines. Fruitful broader impact activities require key elements, no matter the composition of the audience. For example, a high degree of success can be achieved when a “bridge builder” facilitates the interactions between scientists and non-science audiences. This presentation will offer other examples of best practices and successful strategies for engaging scientists in broader impact activities, increasing societal impacts of scientific research, and providing opportunities for collaboration on a national scale. http://www.cosee.net",

There are now CSEP testing centers in California, New Zealand, Japan, and Europe, with 430 models under evaluation. In this presentation, we describe how the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) testing center has evolved to meet CSEP objectives and we share our experiences in operating the center. The SCEC testing center has been operational since September 1, 2007, and currently hosts 30-minute, 1-day, 3-month, 1-year and 5-year forecasts, both alarm-based and probabilistic, for California, the Western Pacific, and a global testing region. We have reduced testing latency, implemented prototype evaluation of M8 forecasts and currently develop procedures to evaluate externally-hosted forecasts and predictions. These efforts are related to CSEP support of the USGS program in operational earthquake forecasting and a Department of Homeland Security project to register and test external forecast procedures from experts outside seismology. Retrospective experiment for the 2010 Darfield earthquake sequence formed an important addition to the CSEP activities where the predictive skills of physics-based and statistical forecasting models are compared. We describe the open-source CSEP software that is available to researchers as they develop their forecast models (http://northridge.usc.edu/trac/csep/wiki/MiniCSEP).

A substantial amount of flare energy goes into accelerating electrons. HXR observations are a crucial tool for understanding this non-thermal emission and the energy release in flares. RHESSI is able to study this emission over many orders of magnitude (active region flares from X-class to A-class microflares), but it cannot detect the emission from smaller events. Such “nanoflares” have been postulated as a possible source of coronal heating and their existence and relationship to larger flares is still uncertain. In order to detect these events in HXRs, instruments more sensitive than RHESSI are required. Launched in 2012, the astrophysics mission NuSTAR uses focusing optics to directly image X-rays between ~2-80 keV. Although not optimized for solar observations, NuSTAR’s highly sensitive imaging spectroscopy will be used to search for the faintest X-ray emission from the Sun. These solar observations will begin in September 2014. Here we present the first results of our search for transient brightenings in active and quiet Sun regions with NuSTAR.",

Like many previous and current indicators networks, this effort is focused on describing changes in the condition of a small number of indicators of current status and condition of important resources and processes. But an additional challenge remains, which is critically important for indicators that are meant to be used not only scientifically, but also to inform decision-makers: how should we think about indicators that are meant to impart information on future trajectories of the Earth system? In this presentation, I examine two different ways in which this might be accomplished – first is the use of leading indicators that are measures of current conditions, but for which their change over time is strongly correlated with future directions. The second is the use of model-based indicators. Both have strengths and weaknesses, and we explore how each can be approached in the context of global change.",

An array of ground experiments at three unique permafrost sites will record permafrost depth, structure, meteorological data, and emissions of key greenhouse gases during a springtime permafrost thaw. Ground data will be linked to climate models and landscape structure from satellite imagery to gauge the magnitude of the feedbacks.\nGWU will deploy an open path instrument for independent measurement of ground-level carbon dioxide and methane. For several decades, our laboratory has developed diode laser absorption techniques using mid-infrared diode lasers as well as cavity- enhanced absorption measurements using near-infrared source. In the current project, we will continue to develop a system for open path measurements that builds on our past experience with deployment of multi-laser, multi species sensors. Spectral simulations suggest that at ambient levels of CO2 and CH4 (390 and 2 ppmV, respectively) we will observe extinction coefficients of ≈ 10-4 m-1 or ≈ 1% absorption over a 200 m path. Prior work in our laboratory suggests that a SNR in excess of 100 will be achievable at these absorption levels using wavelength-modulation techniques.\nWavelength modulation spectroscopy entails applying a small amplitude modulation (on the order of the width of a spectral feature) to a laser’s emitted frequency as it tunes through a spectrum. This is readily accomplished with near infrared telecom lasers whose frequency can be swept by varying the injection current going into the laser at fixed temperature. By sampling the detector’s signal at a multiple of the modulation frequency, the resulting signal takes on the appearance of the spectrum’s derivative. Typically, this is accomplished using a lock-in amplifier. To avoid the power burden of this electrical component we are exploring the use of digital signal processing using the microcontroller embedded in the sensor.\nHere we report on progress on the sensor’s construction as well as demonstration of it for making both lab and field measurements using both “traditional” lock-in based demodulation for WMS as well as its use with our software-based, WMS scheme.",

            "abstract": "Crowdfunding involves going directly to the public for financial support of your research project. It’s new and cool and may help you carry out important scientific research. But before starting a crowdfunding project, I suggest you ask yourself these questions:\nCan I carry out a useful scientific investigation on a relatively low budget?\nDo I like to work on “hot” topics where traditional scientific support may not be available?\nCan I clearly identify the scientific questions to be addressed?\nIs there a constituency for this project who are likely to provide financial support?\nAm I willing to publish my work in a peer-reviewed, open-access journal and then see it criticized by non-scientists?\nDo I like to “tweet,” write and publish lab notes and otherwise communicate with my backers?\nCan I conduct my work with complete transparency, knowing that all written and electronic information I generate may be subject to a “Freedom of Information” request?\nAnd finally….\n8. Am I unwilling to sit back as important policy-relevant research remains undone?\n If you answered “yes” to all of these questions, then congratulations! Crowdfunding may be right for you!\nIn 2013, I chose to become involved in research on the air quality impacts of diesel rail traffic. This was in response to several proposals to substantially increase rail shipments of coal through the Pacific Northwest en route to Asia. At the time, I pursued funding from traditional sources to carry out a scientific investigation on the relationship between diesel rail traffic and air quality. But no funding could be found, likely due to the highly polarized nature of the debate. So I turned to crowdfunding to support this research, using Microryza.com (now Experiment.com), and quickly raised about $24,000. We carried out the first phase of this study in the summer of 2013 at two sites in the Pacific Northwest. The goals were to investigate the diesel particulate matter emissions from all trains, and possible coal dust from open coal trains. Our findings from this phase were published in 2014, and we are now working on a second phase. In this presentation, I will present the results of our work in both 2013 and 2014 and discuss the application of crowdfunding to scientific research.",

The first campaign was carried out in June/July 2011 when the solar flux index F10.7 was about 95 SFU and used the FCI 30 MHz coherent backscatter radar interferometer located in the magnetic equatorial site of Sao Luis, Brazil. The second campaign was conducted during June/July 2014, when the solar flux was about 130 SFU (NOAA SPWC). The second campaign was used the Measurements of Equatorial and Low-latitude Ionospheric irregularities over Sao Luis, South America (MELISSA) radar interferometer, which was recently developed and replaced the FCI radar in Sao Luis. We will present new measurements made by MELISSA and a comparison of the 2011 and 2014 observations. We found that, despite a small change in solar flux conditions, a drastic change in the occurrence of meter-scale irregularities is observed. We will present and explain the observations, and discuss the underlying ionospheric and electrodynamic conditions based on auxiliary satellite measurements and modeling.",

            "abstract": "In silicate volcanism, such as on Earth or Io, eruptions typically result from fracture formation caused by interaction of tectonic stresses with inflating, pressurized magma sources, leading to transport of melt through an evolving conduit. On icy satellites the paradigm may be similar, resulting from some combination of tidal stresses and expansion of freezing water within, or near the base of, an ice shell. Such a fracture will result in eruption if mass continuity can be established, with buoyancy aided by exsolution and expansion of dissolved volatiles. After onset, conduit shape evolves due to: (1) shear-stresses or frictional erosional; (2) wallrock “bursting” due to massive wall stresses; (3) wall melting or condensation of particles due to heat transfer; or (4) changes in applied stresses.\nPreliminary thermodynamic and fluid mechanical analysis suggests some initial cooling during ascent resulting from exsolution and expansion of volatiles, thermally buffered by freezing, Conduit contraction may occur, and so evolution towards a deep, gas-filled plume chamber is difficult to accommodate without evoking a co-incidental process. Conduit flaring occurs near the surface where velocities are greatest, enhancing erosion. Here, viscous dissipative heating exceeds adiabatic cooling, and so some boiling (a few wt%) may occur. In contrast with silicate volcanism, decompression to below the triple point will occur within conduit, vent or jet, resulting in rapid freezing and boiling of the remaining water at a 6.8:1 ratio. Subsequent isentropic or adiabatic expansion within erupting jets may result in a few percent net of condensation or sublimation. These effects combined lead to ~4:1-7:1 solid:vapor ratios in the jet for most eruption conditions.\nThese figures are consistent with the ~6:1 inferred in Enceladus’ jets, supporting the hypothesis that the Enceladus plume draws from a subsurface body of liquids through a conduit. Similar results are anticipated if cryovolcanic plumes are confirmed on Europa. However, eruption from an ocean is more challenging there, as far greater volatile contents would be required to facilitate mass continuity from an initial fracture, and hence eruption, from the higher pressure source. Shallower sources, such as proposed under chaos, are less challenging.",

            "abstract": "Bromine monoxide (BrO) is an important atmospheric constituent, participating in the destruction of tropospheric and stratospheric ozone and the oxidation of gaseous elemental Hg (GEM) to form reactive Hg (RM). During the Nitrogen, Oxidants, Mercury and Aerosol Distributions, Sources and Sinks (NOMADSS) campaign in the summer of 2013, our group operated a limb-scanning Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) instrument onboard the NSF/NCAR C-130 aircraft with the goal of quantifying BrO, formaldehyde (HCHO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and other trace gases. Here we present observations of Differential Slant Column Densities (DSCD) obtained in the limb derived using the DOAS analysis technique. A radiative transfer model (McArtim [Deutschmann et al., 2011]), constrained by in-situ measurement on the aircraft or from published literature, was utilized to simulate the DSCDs and to derive BrO mixing ratios at flight altitude.\nBrO mixing ratios were typically below our 2σ detection limit (ranging from 0.5 – 1 ppt) with the exception of a high altitude (~7km asl) portion of a flight over Central and West Texas (RF 6), and a marine boundary layer (~0.2km asl) flight leg off the coast of South Carolina (RF 16). Around 1.9 ± 0.25 ppt of BrO was detected for about 1.5 hours in the high altitude flight, and around 1.0 ±0.5 ppt of BrO was detected in the marine boundary layer. Several features were present in the higher altitude air-mass with detectable BrO: O3 and humidity were significantly depressed relative to other flight legs at the same altitude and large concentrations of RM were simultaneously observed. We will present possible sources for the anomalously high BrO mixing ratios in the sampled air mass and discuss the implications of our knowledge on free-tropospheric bromine chemistry and its effects on GEM oxidation.",

            "abstract": "Riparian habitats represent a small fraction of lands in Sierra Nevada mountain watersheds, yet support a disproportionately high diversity and richness of biota. The presence of these habitats in the Sierras is largely controlled by geomorphic characteristics of the watershed and hydrologic regime. Riparian species’ life history strategies influence recruitment success and survival under the dynamic and episodic, yet seasonally predictable, hydrology conditions of the region, including infrequent extreme precipitation events and multiple years with low precipitation. However, dams and diversions affect flows throughout the Sierra Nevada and regional climate change models project changes in inter- and intra-annual hydrology patterns that may affect riparian recruitment and future distribution. Studies were conducted in twelve reaches on six rivers (impaired and unimpaired rivers) that directly link successful riparian recruitment years to hydrologic and channel geomorphic conditions, and included: vegetation surveys, tree core dating, topographic surveys, reach-specific stage-discharge relationships and modeling, and annual hydrograph analyses. Availability of suitable substrate for establishment created by scouring high flow events; timing of snowmelt recession that varied by water year and elevation; spring snowmelt stage recession rates typically less than 12 percent per day; and site-specific controls on inundated width and depth and water availability were identified as the primary determinants for successful recruitment years across all rivers and reaches. The results were used to develop tools to guide and communicate evaluations of flow management alternatives to managers and stakeholders and can also be used to assess potential riparian responses to flow management actions or climate change that may affect the future distribution and complexity of riparian habitats along Sierra Nevada mountain streams.",

            "abstract": "In low energy environments such as the subsurface, the minimum energy required to maintain cellular integrity and function (maintenance energy) may represent a significant fraction of the total energy available to microbial communities. However, traditional kinetic and thermodynamic models incorporating key microbial processes are often developed using data collected in nutrient rich growth media. In this study, slow microbial growth in the subsurface was simulated using a flow through bioreactor system in experiments designed to determine the maintenance energy requirement of the model subsurface bacterium Shewanella oneidensis. An existing bioreactor system (Applikon EZ-control®, 2.4 L) was modified to include a biomass retention filtration unit (retentostat) resulting in biomass accumulation over time. An artificial low-nutrient groundwater medium was optimized for slow S. oneidensis growth and was supplied and removed from the reactor at flow rates on the order of 1 mL min-1 with a dilution rate of 0.025 h-1. The retentostat was run under electron donor limited conditions with nitrate, a common groundwater contaminant, supplied at 0.025 mM h-1 and lactate supplied in excess at 0.125 mM h-1. Respiratory ammonification of nitrate by S. oneidensis and cell growth was monitored over time (40 days) and compared to parallel incubations in batch reactors. Initial rates of ammonification were similar in the bioreactor and batch reactors, however, optical density and ATP measurements showed slow yet increasing microbial growth over time (generation time = 17 days) in the retentostat. In contrast, cells in the batch reactors did not grow significantly and died within 2 weeks of inoculation. A maintenance energy demand was estimated (2.5 kJ C-mol biomass h-1) by fitting the biomass production rates to the van Verseveld equation. The low maintenance energy demand of S. oneidensis as compared to typical maintenance energies reported in the literature (>10 kJ C-mol biomass h-1) likely reflects its metabolic versatility and ability to persist in low energy environments. In addition to the retentostat results, we will also discuss our efforts to develop a kinetic and thermodynamic based biogeochemical model which explicitly accounts for energy used for both microbial maintenance and growth.",

            "abstract": "Recent need for englacial radiolocation of instrumentation has motivated the construction of a compact radio for GPS style trilateration. The summer of 2014 offered an opportunity to test the radio across the surface of the Greenland ice sheet. A compact crystal oscillator transmitter was developed to operate on the 10 meter amateur band, to put a watt across the transmit antenna. The transmitting antenna used was a coiled dipole antenna, which was tuned in a laboratory ice block. Multiple receive antennas were constructed, a Moxon beam, and two dipole antennas one tuned for air and another tuned for ice. Transmission was tested with a constant tone while positioning the radio above and below the glacier surface. The received signal was well defined at distances of 727m along ice surface despite the complexity and water content. The performance of each receive antenna was judged on a calculated signal to noise ratio. It was theorized the gain from the Moxon beam, reported to be 10dB, would be equal to the loss of signal in the reflection on the ice-air boundary, and thus performance for the Moxon beam and the dipole in ice would be equivalent. Preliminary results suggest this to be true. Previous modeling suggested that a signal to noise ratio above ten would give satisfactory results for trilateration. Here calculated signal to noise was greater at 730m, suggesting that developing a capable receiver would be the next step towards completing englacial trilateration.",

The solar and geomagnetic forcing is based on prevailing geophysical conditions. The simulations show a strong day-to-day variability in the upper thermospheric neutral temperature tidal fields, which is smoothed out quickly when averaging is applied over several days, e.g. up to 50% DE3 amplitude reduction for a 10-day average. This is an important result with respect to tidal diagnostics from satellite observations where averaging over multiple days is inevitable. In order to assess TIME-GCM performance we compare the simulations with measurements from the Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE), Challenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites.",

Hydrothermal environments cover a wide range of habitable space up to and including life’s known limits and provide a window into deep geological, geochemical, and biological processes. Hydrothermal water compositions, as sampled from and measured in terrestrial hot springs on Earth's surface, vary in chemical constituent speciation and concentrations over orders of magnitude in a plethora of geochemical parameters with biological significance, including hydronium ion, sulfide, iron, zinc, magnesium, manganese, and molybdenum. Proteins provide a link between geochemistry and microbial activity by catalyzing chemical reactions. Proteins extracted and identified by tandem mass spectrometry from 13 hot spring sediments and biofilms - covering pH values from 2-9 and diverse geochemical compositions - function as efflux transporters, permeases, electron transporters, and others, suggesting that these processes were present in the environment and occurring at the time of sampling. Metalloenzymes have been identified, including the iron protein rubrerythrin, thought to be involved in oxidative stress protection in anaerobic bacteria and archaea, as well as proteins involved in macronutrient processing (carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen, and sulfur). The melding of biochemistry with geochemistry shows potential for quantifying microbial activity in deep environments by demonstrating the presence - and as techniques improve, relative abundances - of reaction-catalyzing enzymes. Moreover, using hot spring sources and their outflow channels as chemical and biological models of geologic time helps decipher the origin and co-evolution of life and geochemistry.",

            "abstract": "Bands and vortices are the two main features of Jupiter's cloud layer. The bands correspond to zonal jets, with strong eastward flow near the equator, and alternating east-west jets at higher latitudes. The vortices are mostly anticyclonic, including the Great Red Spot, which drifts at a southern latitude in the first anticyclonic shear zone away from the equator. Although space missions and ground based observations have revealed beautiful and detailed images of cloud layer flow and thermal emissions, fundamental questions remain unanswered. How deeply are the jets and vortices seated? Why are most jovian vortices anticyclonic, opposite to cyclones on Earth? Previous investigations of planetary flows have focussed on either jets or vortices with few studies of systems that host both features. Here we study rotating convection using the benchmarked 3D spherical anelastic dynamo code MAGIC, with flow driven by convection at depth, but with a stably stratified outer layer. Our results show that multiple jets, which are driven by convection, penetrate deeper than vortices, which are confined to the shallow stably stratified layer. Due to computational limitations requiring high viscosity, model vortices have short lifetimes. Nevertheless, similar to the Great Red Spot, the largest model vortices occur in the lowest latitude anticyclonic shear bands, which form near the outer boundary latitudes corresponding to the inner boundary tangent cylinder. The dominance of anticyclonic vortices is explained simply in that they arise from ascending (divergent) plumes which are spun in the anticyclonic direction by the Coriolis force.",

            "abstract": "We present a renewed estimate of the fraction of the total Near-Inertial (NI) energy flux leaving the ocean's Mixed Layer (ML) based on simulations performed by a global high-resolution (1/10°) ocean general circulation model. The quantification of this fraction is important for understanding the global general circulation and the energetics of the ocean. At the same time NI waves that are excited at the ocean surface by winds are a major power source for deep ocean mixing. NI waves that escape the turbulent ML can propagate freely into the stratified deep ocean. When they break in the oceanic interior, they can contribute to deep mixing.\nThe previous studies on the subject indicate that a large portion of wind-power input to NI motions is dissipated in a surface layer of fixed depth and in specific regions in the ocean. In comparison, we study in detail the spatial and temporal variability of the ocean’s ML and gives an estimate on a global scale, which allows for the first time for a global quantification of the transfer of NI energy into the deep layers of the ocean. We address the following questions: What is the magnitude of the wind-power input to NI motions simulated with our high-resolution ocean model? How large is the fraction of the total wind-induced NI energy flux that leaves the ML? What are the main factors that control this fraction?\nThe wind-power input to surface NI motions amounts to 0.35 TW, of which a fraction of about 11% i.e., 0.04 TW leaves the ML and propagates into the stratified interior of the ocean. Locally, this fraction tends to decrease with increasing depth of the ML and with increasing strength of wind stress variability, indicating the strong control of the turbulent dissipation inside the ML on the fraction. The low power input by NI waves points towards the importance of other energy sources (like the dissipation of mesoscale eddy energy) for interior mixing to sustain the global general circulation in the ocean.",

This region has been monitored extensively with a variety of sensors in the framework of the integrated plate boundary observatory (IPOC). Here, we use pre-seismic GNSS observations to infer the coupling at the subduction plate interface. We carefully analyze the robustness of the results by testing various boundary conditions, rake angle constraints, regularization schemes and Earth models. A slip distribution is inverted from coseismic observations and compared to the locking pattern. Assuming temporally stable coupling, we compute accumulated moment and subtract all major seismic events since 1877, including the Pisagua event. We conclude that this event released some of the accumulated moment in the central region of the seismic gap, but significantly more could still be present.",

            "abstract": "Commercially available digital cameras provide an unprecedented opportunity for detailed study of cloud structure. Key attributes of such cameras include large number of pixels, (e.g., 3456 x 4608) yielding rich detail of spatial structure, high spatial resolution (e.g., 30 µrad, corresponding to 30 mm for a cloud at 1 km height), and high dynamic range (16 bit in each of three color channels). These attributes permit detailed examination of spatial structure and temporal variability of the influence of clouds on the radiance field. Photography of clouds from the surface looking upwards affords the further advantage, relative to satellite imagery looking downward, that the background is black (space) with contributions to path radiance only from blue sky (Rayleigh scattering), aerosols, and clouds, without complication of surface-leaving radiance. Here we present preliminary results from measurements at Long Island, NY, in summer 2014. The camera was pointed vertically, typically with field of view 22 x 29 mrad (cf. solar diameter 9.3 mrad), corresponding to 22 x 29 m at 1 km. Even at this scale there is no uniquely determined cloud fraction. Cloud fraction defined as the fraction of pixels that encompass at least some cloud (DiGirolamo and Davies, JGR, 1997) is found to be highly dependent (several tens of percent) on threshold and on resolution, which can readily be artificially degraded by pixelating the image). Likewise, in contrast with findings of Sachs, Lovejoy, and Schertzer (Fractals, 2002) no unique fractal dimension appears to be associated with clouds, the retrieved value being dependent on approach and averaging method, Figure 1.\nFigure 1.

            "abstract": "Metal isotopes are novel tools, and have expanded the geochemical toolbox for elucidating the functioning of the Earth over various time scales. Carbonate-based stable isotope proxies now extend well beyond the traditional major elements (C and O) to include Ca, as well as trace elements such as Sr, S, Mg, B, Li, Cd, and U. Such trace isotopic proxies may contain invaluable information about the Earth system in the past, but can be susceptible to diagenetic alteration over long time scales. It is therefore critical that diagenetic effects are understood and can be recognized in ancient rocks. The extent of alteration depends on reaction rate and advection velocity in the sedimentary section, and elemental partitioning and isotopic effects associated with diagenesis. Numerical approaches, such as reactive transport models, are extremely useful tools for constraining such variables, and for testing hypotheses related to alteration of proxy records.\nReactive transport models allow for constraints on calcite recrystallization rates in natural systems; data from ODP Sites 807A, 1170A, 1171A, and 806B suggest rapid recrystallization in relatively young sediments, as well as a Ca isotopic fractionation factor (α) associated with calcite recrystallization close to 1 (Δ=0). While the former is critical for addressing the fidelity and accuracy of a variety of geochemical proxies, the latter is distinctly different from that associated with the formation of carbonates in the surface ocean (Δ~ -1.35‰), suggesting considerable isotopic leverage to alter Ca isotopes during diagenesis. While Ca isotopes are generally well buffered in carbonate-rich sediments, this leverage to alter may be expressed as a reduction in the amplitude of geochemical variability in the solid or as a result of reactions near the sediment-seawater interface (as seen at ODP Site 1221 associated with chemical burndown during the PETM). Further, the Ca and Mg isotopic compositions of shallow water carbonates at ODP Site 1196A suggest recognizeable diagenetic trends that can be explained using simple numerical models, and offer constraints on the Mg partition coefficient and isotopic fractionation factors associated with dolomitization and recrystallization.",

Emissions inventories are often used to assess the impact of policies implemented to reduce GHG emissions, but these bottom-up approaches are plagued by large uncertainties. Top-down approaches are therefore necessary to verify the results and quantify and reduce the uncertainties.\nHere we present a full year of continuous in situ measurements of CO2 and CH4 from a site in Livermore, CA, which is well positioned to capture the outflow from a large metropolitan region that includes San Francisco, the East Bay, and San Jose. These measurements are ongoing and are made using a Picarro CO2/CH4/H2O analyzer sampling at 27 meters a. g. l. at the Sandia Livermore tower (Lon: -121.71˚, Lat: 37.67˚). The measurements are calibrated ~daily using whole air cylinders that are referenced to the NOAA/WMO scales. From these calibrations, the long term stability of the instrument was determined to be 0.032 ppm for CO2 and 0.24 ppb for CH4. As part of our discussion, we will describe the sampling platform, the automated calibration system, the various post-processing QA/QC procedures used, and some analytical figures of merit.\nWe have analyzed the ambient mole fraction data, referenced to a clean air background, across seasonal, day-of-week, and diurnal time scales and as a function of various meteorological parameters, including wind direction and boundary layer height in order to isolate different sources of variability in the CO2 and CH4 signals. We have found, for example, that substantial weekday/weekend differences exist in the CO2 signal (higher on weekdays) but not in the CH4 signal, consistent with the expectation that the transportation sector is a stronger contributor to CO2 concentrations than to CH4 concentrations in the region. We have also compared the observations to hourly simulations of CO2 and CH4 mole fractions from a Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model (FLEXPART-WRF) combined with emissions inventories of both gases, analyzing the simulated data for similar temporal patterns to those found in the observed data.",

Recent research suggests that a substantial fraction of newly fixed organic matter is exported offshore in the form of dissolved organic matter (DOM). However, to date only a few studies have examined DOM composition in the context of production and export from upwelling systems. The ultimate fate and geochemical impact of coastal DOM exported to offshore and mesopelagic ecosystems also remains largely unknown.\nBetween 2007-2009 we conducted a high-resolution biogeochemical time series at the Granite Canyon Marine Pollution Studies Lab in part to evaluate the seasonal production and export of DOM from the Central CA coast. Our previous work demonstrated substantial, albeit disparate, seasonal production of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC, DON) – with high DON (and low C:N ratios) produced during upwelling and high DOC produced during summer/fall water column stratification (Walker and McCarthy, 2012). Here we present new total dissolved D/L amino acid (TDAA) and UV-oxidizable DOC radiocarbon (Δ14C) data with the goal of determining the relative sources (heterotrophic vs. autotrophic), bioavailability, microbial processing and 14C-ages of C-rich vs. N-rich DOM exported from this upwelling system.\nOur results suggest that C-rich DOM produced during water column stratification carries a large microbial signature (i.e. high D/L AA ratios and non-protein AA abundance), whereas N-rich DOM produced during upwelling appears to be fresh, autotrophic DOM (i.e. lowest D/L AA ratios and highest TDAA abundance). DOM Δ14C signatures also did not approximate in situ dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and instead were far more negative and highly correlated to water mass density. Together our results indicate a previously unrecognized source of highly labile yet pre-aged DOM potentially impacting offshore and mesopelagic ecosystems.",

Some biomes – such as savanna and some Mediterranean ecosystems – are fire maintained; they are characterized by frequent or at least regular fires that have driven the evolution of fire-tolerant and fire-dependent flora. The role of fire is less often considered in other biomes, such as tropical forest, that are less flammable and where fires are less frequent. However, recent work has suggested that fires are increasing in prevalence in some tropical forests, including in the southern Amazon. These fires can have unparalleled impacts on forest community dynamics and on forest carbon stocks, but quantification of fire impacts on Amazonian forests is restricted to a few sites and estimates of their extent are thus largely anecdotal. Here, we present traits data from a set of sites throughout the Amazon that aim to examine how fire-related traits vary with respect to large-scale climatic gradients in order more broadly to estimate the distribution of fire susceptibility across the Amazon basin. Combined with maps of fire potential, these results have yielded basin-wide estimates of fire impacts in the Amazon that can be used for comparison with modeled results.",

These tephra layers are deposited almost instantaneously across wide areas of ice sheets, creating horizons that can provide “pinning points” to adjust ice time scales that may otherwise be lacking detailed chronology. A combination of traditional particle morphology characterization by SEM with new non-destructive X-ray micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT) has been used to analyze selected coarse grained tephra in the West Antarctica Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide WDC06A ice core. Micro-CT has the ability to image particles as small as 50µm in length (15µm resolution), quantifying both particle shape and size.\n The WDC06A contains hundreds of dusty layers of which 36 have so far been identified as primary tephra layers. Two of these tephra layers have been characterized as phreatomagmatic eruptions based on SEM imagery and are blocky and platy in nature, with rare magmatic particles. These layers are strikingly different in composition from the typical phonolitic and trachytic tephra produced from West Antarctic volcanoes. These two layers are coarser in grain size, with many particles (including feldspar crystals) exceeding 100µm in length. One tephra layer found at 3149.138m deep in the ice core is a coarse ~1mm thick basanitic tephra layer with a WDC06-7 ice core age of 45,381±2000yrs. The second layer is a ~1.3 cm thick zoned trachyandesite to trachydacite tephra found at 2569.205m deep with an ice core age 22,470±835yrs. Micro-CT analysis shows that WDC06A-3149.138 has normal grading with the largest particles at the bottom of the sample (~160μm). WDC06A-2569.205 has a bimodal distribution of particles with large particles at the top and bottom of the layer. These large particles are more spherical in shape at the base and become more irregular and finer grained higher in the layer, likely showing changes in eruption dynamics. The distinct chemistry as well as the blocky and large grain size of the two tephra lead us to believe that these eruptions are from volcanoes proximal to WAIS Divide and did not transport far because neither tephra was observed in the Byrd core (<100km away). It is likely that these tephra are sourced from volcanoes beneath the WAIS and have since been buried and if they were to erupt again, may contribute to ice sheet instability.",

            "abstract": "The scarcity of iron limits marine export production and carbon uptake in about 25% of the global ocean where the concentration of major nutrients is high, yet phytoplankton growth is low. Of these, the Southern Ocean is the region where variations in iron availability can have the largest effect on Earth’s carbon cycle through its fertilizing effect on marine ecosystems, both in the modern and in the past.\nRecent work in the Subantarctic South Atlantic (Martínez-Garcia et al., 2009, 2014, Anderson et al., 2014) suggests that dust-driven iron fertilization lowered atmospheric CO2 from about 225 ppm to 185 ppm in the latter half of each glacial cycle of the late Pleistocene, with the increase in Subantarctic productivity consuming a greater fraction of the surface nutrients and thus driving more storage of carbon in the ocean interior. The opposite effect, reduced iron fertilization, has been hypothesized to drive the 15-20 ppm increase during Heinrich Events in the last glacial cycle (Martínez -Garcia et al, 2014).\nThe vast majority of the information we have so far is from observations in the Subantarctic Atlantic and therefore our current estimates of the role of the Southern Ocean in lowering CO2 rely critically on the assumed extrapolation of the results from the Atlantic Sector to the entire Southern Ocean.\nHowever, the Pacific Sector of the Southern Ocean not only accounts for the largest surface area of the Subantarctic Southern Ocean, but the deep Pacific Ocean also can be inferred - based on its volume – to have stored the largest fraction of carbon that was extracted from the atmosphere and from the terrestrial biosphere during glacial periods.\nHere we report first results from a set of cores from the Subantarctic Pacific (PS75, Lamy et al 2014), including a high-resolution sediment core (PS75/056-1) from the flank of the East Pacific Rise that allows to resolve millennial year variability over the past glacial cycle. We test how tightly dust and biological productivity are coupled over glacial/interglacial and millennial timescales in the Subantarctic Pacific. The results will allow us to determine whether or not the Subantarctic Pacific experienced increased nutrient utilization due to iron fertilization during glacial periods, in phase with iron fertilization in the South Atlantic.",

            "abstract": "Our current understanding of oxidative processes in the atmosphere is guided by measurements of directly-emitted volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their oxidation products. Mechanisms for this oxidation have been proposed based on these measurements. These mechanisms usually fall into two regimes: high-NOx and low-NOx (NOx = NO + NO2). High-NOx mechanisms are typical of urban environments while low-NOx mechanisms tend to dominate rural or remote areas. Understanding the low-NOx pathway presents a unique challenge. The first-generation products of this pathway are organic hydroperoxides. This class of atmospherically-relevant compounds are not commercially available and the synthetic methods used to prepare them are still underdeveloped. This work focuses on the synthesis and measurement of several isomers of isoprene hydroxyhydroperoxides (ISOPOOH), the main first-generation products of the low-NOx isoprene oxidation pathway. We present work that demonstrates that ISOPOOH is an interference in both GC and PTR-MS measurements, appearing as product of the high-NOx oxidation pathway. We suggest a possible mechanism for this interference and also discuss the implications of this interference on studies of OH reactivity, O:C ratios, OH recycling and SOA potential for these compounds. We also present results of the experiments investigating air-water partitioning and the condensed phase chemistry of these compounds.",

            "abstract": "The Ross Ice Shelf, located in the embayment between East and West Antarctica, is one of the largest underexplored patches of ocean on the planet. Sediment cores show that the Ross Ice Shelf can disintegrate during some interglacial periods. The conditions required for sudden collapse are not well constrained. A key to understanding the dynamics and long-term stability of the Ross Ice Shelf system is having high-resolution constraints on its boundary conditions, including sea floor bathymetry. The sea floor under the Ross Ice Shelf has developed in response to both the tectonic development of the West Antarctic Rift and the glacial signature of the waxing and waning Antarctic Ice Sheets. A mixture of fabrics and orientations in its bathymetry reflect this complex development.\nHowever, present oceanographic models of water circulation under the ice are based on low-resolution bathymetric maps drawn from stations spaced 55 km apart obtained during the RIGGS project in the 1970s. In contrast, most of the bathymetry of the world’s oceans has been mapped to approximately 15 km resolution from satellite altimetry and much higher resolution from acoustic surveys. Improvement of Ross Ice Shelf bathymetry can be achieved from combined analysis and inversion of gravity and magnetic data acquired from airborne surveys over the Ross Ice Shelf. Survey lines flown in 2013 by Operation IceBridge, with the Sander Geophysics Ltd AIRGrav system over the central and northern Ross Embayment provide a tenfold increase, to 5 km, of the along track resolution of bathymetry. Newly resolved bathymetric highs and lows have amplitudes of up to 200 km. Combining the gravity and magnetic surveys also reveals the differing geology across the embayment. Results from these surveys, including comparison with ship-based bathymetry data from the Ross Sea, demonstrate the value of gravity and magnetic surveys for mapping the bathymetry of the Ross Ice Shelf and the need for more comprehensive airborne surveys of the region.",

            "abstract": "Global climate change is shifting the dynamics of infectious diseases of humans and wildlife with potential adverse consequences for disease control. Despite this, the role of global climate change in the decline of biodiversity and the emergence of infectious diseases remains controversial. Climate change is expected to increase climate variability in addition to increasing mean temperatures, making climate less predictable. However, few empirical or theoretical studies have considered the effects of climate variability or predictability on disease, despite it being likely that hosts and parasites will have differential responses to climatic shifts. Here we present a theoretical framework for how temperature variation and its predictability influence disease risk by affecting host and parasite acclimation responses. Laboratory experiments and field data on disease-associated frog declines in Latin America support this framework and provide evidence that unpredictable temperature fluctuations, on both monthly and diurnal timescales, decrease frog resistance to the pathogenic chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Furthermore, the pattern of temperature-dependent growth of the fungus on frogs was inconsistent with the pattern of Bd growth in culture, emphasizing the importance of accounting for the host–parasite interaction when predicting climate-dependent disease dynamics. Consistent with our laboratory experiments, increased regional temperature variability associated with global El Niño climatic events was the best predictor of widespread amphibian losses in the genus Atelopus. Thus, incorporating the effects of small-scale temporal variability in climate can greatly improve our ability to predict the effects of climate change on disease.",

            "abstract": "Probably the most remarkable discovery of the Cassini mission to date is that of substantial outgassing of neutral gas and dust from fissures on the southern pole of Enceladus, dubbed the Enceladus ‘plumes’. Ionisation in the plumes provides local plasma loading near Enceladus. Since it is well known that Io and Europa produce strong UV emission at their footprints in Jupiter’s ionosphere members of the Cassini science teams were motivated to search for an analogous auroral footprint associated with plasma loading at Enceladus. During an Enceladus encounter in 2008 the Cassini spacecraft observed anti-planetward energetic field aligned ions and low energy field aligned electrons. Anti-planetward ions and electrons have been associated with the downward auroral current region. Two weeks later the Cassini observed a faint glowing UV spot in Saturn’s northern ionosphere, confirming the electromagnetic link between Enceladus and Saturn. These and other observations strongly suggest that the coupling of Encleadus and Saturn is variable – suggestively due to variable ice volcanic activity on Enceladus. It is important, however, to note that both variability of the auroral footprint emission and plasma enhancements near Enceladus are coupled with Saturn’s variable plasma environment – and so the association is by no means trivial. We will describe the connection of Enceladus with Saturn based on the most recent Cassini-era observations and outline the case for the various sources of variability in the Enceladus-Saturn connection.",

Toward this goal, SBDC worked closely with a geobiologist conducting fieldwork at YNP to explore existing data practices and held a two-day stakeholders workshop at the park with some of the scientists who study it and the National Park Service (NPS) staff who support research activities there.\nThe resulting workshop report[2] recommends, among other things, improvements to the level of detail and consistency of documentation of data and of its sampling and analysis methods. A set of core metadata elements and domain-specific extension elements is proposed (Appendix 9) to provide a more coherent view into the data.\nArmed with these findings, we are pursuing approaches that will reduce the effort, complexity, and risk tied to adoption of these recommendations. During our investigation, we discovered the EarthChem templates[3], into which we began mapping the geobiologist’s data. We find the Vent Fluids template particularly appropriate and adaptable, as many of the high-interest features at YNP are shallow water vents. We are currently building an EarthChem-compatible template that will capture the environmental context of microbes, tracing their identities from water sample through to GenBank entry.\nGiven the variety of potential targets (e.g., site, institutional, and domain repositories; visualization and presentation tools), we decided to record the data in a structured package, which we can transform for a given target. We are using the Data Conservancy’s Packaging Tool[4], which provides an intuitive file system view, stores file checksums, and serializes a graph of relationships. This permits a researcher to conveniently group desired data products into a single self-documenting TAR or Zip file. Initial target repositories are NPS’s IRMA, Data Conservancy, and SEAD/Medici.\n[1]http://cirssweb.lis.illinois.edu/SBDC\n[2] https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/47070\n[3] http://www.earthchem.org/data/templates\n[4] http://dataconservancy.org/dcs-packaging-specification/",

Previous work has been done to evaluate the significance of the effects of hydrological parameters, and their identifiability from heat flux and/or streamflow observations at different flux tower sites with various climate and soil conditions. Such exploratory parameter screening and sensitivity analysis provide guidance on model calibration design; meanwhile, the exploratory ensemble simulations, associated with effective sampling of the input parameter space, can be used to developed reliable surrogate models linking input parameters and output responses such as latent heat fluxes (LH).   In this study, we test the applicability of a surrogate-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inversion method, at different flux tower sites, to identify favorable climate and soil conditions for such inversion efforts. The unknown parameters are decided given our previous parameter screening work, samples are then generated using the quasi-Monte Carlo approach based on the prior distributions of the unknown parameters determined given minimum-relative-entropy theory. The sample sets are ingested into CLM to generate simulations that can be used for fitting polynomial surrogates up to the third order. The surrogates are finalized by compromising the training and testing errors, and integrated in the MCMC-Bayesian framework at each flux tower site. The applicability of the calibration approach for different site conditions is discussed.",

            "abstract": "The capacity of farm-level adaptation to mitigate the impacts of climate change in arid regions dominated by irrigated agriculture fed by snowpack is a critical challenge for developing accurate integrated engineering-economic modeling tools. Economic optimization models provide a valuable benchmark for the theoretical limit of adaptation given a set of clear objectives, conditions, and constraints. However, a major limitation to specifying tractable and accurate models is the large number of potential adaptation strategies that can be taken. There is a need for more empirical research that reveals preferred adaptation strategies in a way that identifies causal relationships.\nThis research seeks to add to the empirical literature on adaptation by exploiting what in the econometric literature is called a “natural experiment” where a policy has isapplied to one group but not another in a way that is random relative to the variables of interest so as to reduce problems of bias in coefficient estimates caused by unobserved heterogeneity.\nThe region of study is the Yakima Basin in Washington State which is a highly diverse region in terms of crop and irrigation technology. This creates significant complication for modeling adaptation since farmers have a wide array of choices including changing cropping patterns and irrigation technologies. Other strategies including water trading and deficit irrigation.\nTwo irrigation districts in the Yakima Basin, Roza and Sunnyside, are adjacent to each other and are nearly identical in growing conditions. The difference is that Roza is severely curtailed during droughts while Sunnyside is not. With the availability of detailed field level data on cropping patterns, irrigation technologies, and land ownership this presents an opportunity to identify the effect of water security risk on farm-level decision making. Preliminary results show that after controlling for other features, a field in Roza is 5% more likely to have an efficient irrigation technology than Sunnyside. Roza irrigators are more likely to incorporate wine grapes which are tolerant to water stress and use less water than most other crops. Other findings with respect to farm and owner characteristics help inform model calibration.",

            "abstract": "A Southern Auroral Electrojet (SAE) index has been recently constructed using seven Antarctica magnetometer stations. It has been compared for case studies with the standard Auroral Electrojet (AE) index, and a near-conjugate to the southern stations Northern Auroral Electrojet (NAE) index. Both similarities and differences with the Northern Hemisphere indices have been detected, and they reveal information about the conjugacy of geomagnetic disturbances. In this work we compare the three indices statistically as a function of the accompanying solar wind (SW) and Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) conditions to further explore conjugacy issues. We use 274 days of common north/south data presence between December 2005 and August 2010. We calculate the cross correlation coefficients and differences between all three pairs, AE-SAE, NAE-SAE, and AE-NAE. We estimate the effect of the SW/IMF conditions on the index correlations and differences using three groups of data: 1) the entire data set, 2) periods when there is no station in the Southern Hemisphere located within the 20-02 Magnetic Local Time (MLT) sector where substorms occur, and 3) separately for the four different seasons. We consider the following SW/IMF quantities: IMF By, Bz, clock angle θ = tan-1(|By|/Bz), coupling parameter sin2(θ/2), SW dynamic pressure, density, velocity, and electric field. We find that high north-south correlation coefficients are more common during strong SW/IMF driving, e.g., southward IMF, high IMF |By|, high SW dynamic pressure, high SW electric field, and high θ and sin2(θ/2). All the above studies are also conducted for the index differences instead of their correlations. We find that the index differences are higher for higher SW/IMF driving, suggesting that the SAE index follows the northern indices trend, but has in general lower values than either the standard AE or the conjugate NAE index. The MLT study shows that the number of high AE/SAE correlations is slightly lower at all clock angles and dynamic pressure levels when no southern station is within 20-02 MLT. Of the four seasons, spring and winter had enough data for their results to be statistically significant. The results show that the number of high correlations is greater during the spring period than the winter period, for various levels of SW pressure, IMF By and IMF Bz.",

            "abstract": "The Wilkes Subglacial Basin (WSB) extends for 1,400 km from George V Land into the interior of East Antarctica and hosts several major glaciers that drain a large sector of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS). This region is of key significance for the long-term stability of the ice sheet in East Antarctica, as it lies well below sea level and its bedrock deepens inland, making it potentially prone to marine ice sheet instability, much like areas of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) that are presently experiencing significant mass loss.\nWe present new enhanced potential field images of the WSB combined with existing radar imaging to study geological controls on bedrock topography and ice flow regimes in this key sector of the ice sheet. These images reveal mayor Precambrian and Paleozoic basement faults that exert tectonic controls both on the margins of the basin and its sub-basins. Several major sub-basins can be recognised: the Eastern Basin, the Central Basins and the Western Basins. Using ICECAP aerogeophysical data we show that these tectonically controlled interior basins connect to newly identified basins underlying the Cook Ice Shelf region. This connection implies that any ocean-induced changes at the margin of the EAIS could potentially propagate rapidly further into the interior.\nWith the aid of simple magnetic and gravity models we show that the WSB does not presently include major post Jurassic sedimentary infill. Its bedrock geology is highly variable and includes Proterozoic basement, Neoproterozoic and Cambrian sediments, intruded by Cambrian arc rocks, and cover rocks formed by Beacon sediments intruded by Jurassic Ferrar sills. Enhanced ice flow in this part of the EAIS occurs therefore in a area of mixed and spatially variable bedrock geology. This contrasts with some regions of the WAIS where more extensive sedimentary basins may represent a geological template for the onset and maintenance of fast glacial flow.",

            "abstract": "Recent observations from IBEX combined with previous measurements from other sources suggest new, local, effects of interstellar turbulence. Observations of various interstellar parameters such as the magnetic field, fluid velocity and electron density, over large spatial scales, have revealed a broadband Kolmogorov spectrum of interstellar turbulence which pervades most of interstellar space. The outer scale (or coherence scale of this turbulence) is found to be approximately 10^19 cm and the inner cutoff scale is less than 1000 km. The root-mean-square relative fluctuation in the fluid and the magnetic-field parameters is of order unity. If this turbulence exists at the heliosphere, the root-mean-square relative fluctuations at 100 (heliospheric) AU scales is approximately 0.1. The recently published value for the change In observed velocity direction for the interstellar flow relative to the heliosphere (Frisch, etal, 2014)is consistent with this. Similarly, interpreting the width of the IBEX ribbon in terms of a fluctuating magnetic field also is in agreement with this picture. Observations of TeV cosmic rays can also be explained. Potential effects of these fluctuations in the interstellar medium on the heliosphere will be discussed.\n",

Samples were collected using an extended rake, after which they were photographed and the plants identified. We also collected environmental data including temperature, dissolved oxygen, and secchi depth. Percent cover of SAV was taken twice using a 0.5 m. quadrat in shallow areas to track the changes in vegetation growth over time. In addition, we tested surface sediment samples for grain size and carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur composition. The percent cover of SAV in Mellan Harrsjön varied from 36%-49% and in Inre Harrsjön it averaged 19%. Across all three lakes, the average percent clay, silt, and sand was 3.8%, 50.1%, 46%, respectively.  Because little research similar to this has been conducted in the area in such a comprehensive manner, these results are important to establish a baseline. Furthermore, these data will help establish how the SAV and environmental data may contribute to methane production and emission in these sub-arctic lakes.",

            "abstract": "Loihi seamount is a mid-plate hotspot volcano located 30 kilometers off the southeast corner of the Big Island of Hawai'i. We measured temperature, concentrations of nitrate + nitrite (NOx), ammonium (NH4+), nitrite (NO2-) and dissolved silica (dSi), as well as the stable N and O isotopic composition of nitrate (δ15N and δ18O) in end-member hydrothermal fluids and microbial mats during three cruises in 2008, 2009 and 2013. We also sequenced 16S rRNA from archaea and bacteria from the same sites during 2006. NH4+ ranged ~0.71-7.5 μM, was positively correlated to dSi and negatively correlated to NOx. NO2- ranged from below detection to 0.49 μM and was not correlated to NOx, dSi or NH4+. In the microbial mats found at the Ula Nui site at 5000 m, NO2-, dSi and NH4+ all increase with depth in the mat, creating a vertical zonation of niches within these mounds. Measured δ15N and δ18O of nitrate suggest biological production and reduction of nitrate are both occurring. Analysis of δ15N-NH4+ is underway and will help constrain the relative magnitude of nitrification to NO2‑ and the potential for N-fixation. Using the measured concentrations of NOx, NO2- and NH4+ and other published data from Loihi, Gibbs energy calculations reveal that several catabolic strategies involving the reduction of NO3- and NO2- could provide energy to microbes in Loihi fluids. Thermodynamically feasible electron donors including HS-, CH4, Fe2+ and NH4+, and the amount of energy available, in units of Joules per kg H2O, varies by orders of magnitude from one sample site to the next. Pyrosequencing of the V6 region of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA from four sites at Loihi detected groups known to participate in denitrification, N-fixation and NO2- oxidation. Among these, the most abundant putative N-reducing microbes include Caldithrix, Epsilonproteobacteria, Thiohalophilus and members of the SAR324 clade. Putative N-fixers detected include members of the bacterial order Chlorobiales and archaeal methanogens in the genera Methanococcus and Methanothermococcus. Members of the NO2- oxidizing phylum Nitrispirae are present in all four samples, and are very abundant in two of them. All this data together reveals that N redox processes are significant sources of energy in subsurface Loihi fluids, and possibly at diffuse flow hydrothermal sites elsewhere",

            "abstract": "ASTER thermal infrared (TIR) data, combined with field observations and pre-existing maps have been used to map Yellowstone’s thermal areas. Thermal anomaly maps and estimates of the radiant geothermal heat flux are important for establishing the baseline thermal activity to better detect and understand future anomalous hydrothermal and/or volcanic activity, and also for monitoring changes in the geothermal system to support decisions regarding infrastructure development, preservation and protection of Yellowstone’s resources, and ensuring visitor safety.\nOne of the critical measurement parameters in the use of spaceborne TIR for studying subtle (sub-pixel, sub-boiling) thermal features is the acquisition of TIR data at night. Acquisition of night time data reduces the influence of solar radiance and increases the temperature difference between thermal targets and the cooler background, thus improving estimates of the geothermal component of heat flux.\nASTER night time TIR data (90-m pixels) are acquired too infrequently and irregularly for regular monitoring purposes. However, the new Landsat 8 platform with the Thermal Infrared Sensor (100-m pixels) has been tasked to regularly collect night time TIR imagery (every 16 days). These data show promise for continued satellite-based thermal monitoring at Yellowstone, and could also be useful in monitoring subtle thermal activity at other volcanic/geothermal systems around the world. This presentation will highlight results of a comparative analysis of Landsat 8 TIRS and ASTER TIR data for measuring and mapping Yellowstone’s thermal areas.",

The TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution) instrument is planned to measure backscattered solar radiation in the 290-740 nm range, including the ultraviolet and visible Chappuis ozone bands for increased sensitivity to near-surface ozone. Observation in the weak Chappuis band takes advantage of the relative transparency of the atmosphere in the visible to achieve sensitivity to near-surface ozone. However, due to the weakness of the ozone absorption features this measurement is more sensitive to errors in visible surface reflectance, which is highly variable. We utilize reflectance measurements of individual plant, man-made, and other surface types to calculate the primary modes of variability of visible surface reflectance at a spectral resolution comparable to than that of TEMPO (0.6 nm). Using MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) BRDF (Bidirection Reflectance Distribution Function)/albedo product and our derived primary modes we construct a high spatial resolution climatology of wavelength-dependent surface reflectance over all viewing scenes and geometries. In the ozone profile retrieval from visible measurements, we can model the surface reflectance by either fitting a combination of primary modes or using the derived high spatial resolution spectral reflectance. We evaluate the improvement using this new reflectance data in multispectral ultraviolet + visible ozone retrievals from the GOME-2 instrument and compare the retrieval performance of using these two approaches.",

Its basic concept is to provide a flexible numerical framework for solving multi-field problems for applications in geoscience and hydrology as e.g. for CO2 storage applications, geothermal power plant forecast simulation, salt water intrusion, water resources management, etc.\nAdvances in computational mathematics have revolutionized the variety and nature of the problems that can be addressed by environmental scientists and engineers nowadays and an intensive code development in the last years enables in the meantime the solutions of much larger numerical problems and applications. However, solving environmental processes along the water cycle at large scales, like for complete catchment or reservoirs, stays computationally still a challenging task.\nTherefore, we started a new OGS code development with focus on execution speed and parallelization. In the new version, a local data structure concept improves the instruction and data cache performance by a tight bundling of data with an element-wise numerical integration loop. Dedicated analysis methods enable the investigation of memory-access patterns in the local and global assembler routines, which leads to further data structure optimization for an additional performance gain.\nThe concept is presented together with a technical code analysis of the recent development and a large case study including transient flow simulation in the unsaturated / saturated zone of the Thuringian Syncline, Germany. The analysis is performed on a high-resolution mesh (up to 50M elements) with embedded fault structures.",

The specific study region spans latitude 34 to 39.5 degrees north and longitude 87 to 93 degrees west and extends to a depth of at least 500 km. The density of data from three networks – The Cooperative New Madrid Seismic Network (CNMSN) operated by CERI, the Earthscope transportable array (TA), and the FlexArray (FA) Northern Embayment Lithospheric Embayment (NELE) project stations – provides us with the opportunity to derive detailed velocity models for this region. We use arrival times from local and regional earthquakes and travel time residuals from teleseismic earthquakes recorded by the three networks from September 2011 to date. The teleseismic body wave arrival times are measured using an Automated and Interactive Measurement of Body Wave Arrival Times (AIMBAT) package (Lou et al., 2012). We perform a joint local and teleseismic inversion (Zhao et al.,1994) to determine the velocity structure. For the local events, the hypocenters are relocated iteratively in the inversion process using an efficient 3-D ray tracing technique. We image a significant low velocity anomaly in the upper mantle with a concentration at about 200 - 300 km depth and it is a consistent feature in both the Vp and Vs tomography results. Checkerboard tests show that the spatial resolution is high in the upper mantle especially for the Vp model. The spatial resolution in the crust is fairly high for most of the study area except at the edges and the southeastern part, which can be attributed to diminished local earthquake activity. We perform synthetic tests to isolate smearing effects and further confirm the features in the tomographic images. Vp/Vs ratios are determined for the portions of the model with highest resolution. Preliminary results indicate that significant Vp/Vs ratio variations are present only at depths shallower than 200 km.",

            "abstract": "Beginning in Fall of 2004, NASA and the National Park Service (NPS) embarked on collaborative work aimed at bringing the wonders of NASA science and education content into the hands of outstanding and highly regarded science “communicators” – interpreters in NPS. What began as a showcase of NASA content delivered in an interpretive workshop has evolved and matured into a long-standing, and growing partnership focused on climate change communication. The partnership has been fruitful and successful, producing a variety of professional development events that have resulted in participants reaching millions of Park and Refuge visitors and thousands of interpreters and educators, with content derived from our courses. Earth to Sky (ETS) now includes the US Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA, and is working towards establishment of a network of regional networks made up of alumni and their communities.\nThe key to our success has been the careful building and nurturing of the partnership, and its resulting community of practice, beginning with excellent facilitated meetings of the parties involved, and continuing through implementation of best practices in partnership and collaborative work. Project design, development, and execution were accomplished in true partnership with leaders from our intended audience, NPS interpreters, and later USFWS environmental educators. Our partners were fully involved, from the inception of the first workshop design, through its implementation and assessment, to strategic planning for sustainability and all subsequent efforts. ETS can serve as a model of an effective partnership in climate communication efforts, drawing upon the strengths of partners with widely different areas of expertise to produce cohesive work with high impact. We will share the ETS model of partnership, and discuss how this model might be useful as the climate communication community moves towards a more coherent approach to improve climate literacy.",

            "abstract": "Arrays of large immobile boulders in mountainous stream reaches modify the patterns of bedload movement through the controls that they exert on their surrounding flow field. Boulders within an array generate complex mean and turbulent patterns in their vicinity, resulting to a variable bed shear stress field. At the same time, boulder arrays generate form drag, which reduces the bed shear stress applied by the flow on the incoming bedload sediment. This study aims to assess the collective effects of a boulder array on its surrounding time-averaged and turbulent flow fields, as well as the collective array form drag effects accounting for the variable bed shear stress distribution around a boulder of the array. Controlled laboratory experiments are conducted with a single boulder and an array of identical, isolated boulders mounted atop a flat, rough bed and subjected to identical flow conditions. The mean and turbulent flow fields around the boulder with and without the presence of a boulder array are resolved via a Laser Doppler Velocimeter and an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter, respectively. The results show that an individual boulder modifies the time-averaged streamwise velocity and turbulence intensity in its immediate vicinity along the streamwise (x/dc < 2-3) and vertical (z/dc < 1) directions. At locations further from the boulder, the time-averaged streamwise velocity was found to be globally decelerated, likely due to the form drag generated collectively by the boulder array. Our results suggested that the collective array form drag absorbs a portion of the total applied shear by the flow, hence reducing the bed shear stress exerted by the flow on the individual boulders of the array. Furthermore, the array was found to significantly reduce the turbulence intensity near the bed. Overall, our findings suggest that the collective boulder array has sizeable effects on the surrounding flow field and bed shear stress distribution, which should not be ignored in sediment transport predictions.",

            "abstract": "Annually-harvested agroecosystems have the potential to be net carbon sinks only if their root systems allocate sufficient carbon belowground and if this carbon is then retained as stable soil organic matter. Soil respiration measurements are the most common approach to evaluate the stability of soil carbon at experimental time scales, but valid inferences require the partitioning of soil respiration into root-derived (current-year C) and heterotrophic (older C) components. This partitioning is challenging at the field scale because roots and soil are intricately mixed and physical separation in impossible without disturbing the fluxes to be measured.\nTo partition soil flux and estimate the C sink potential of bioenergy crops, we used the carbon isotope difference between C3 and C4 plant species to quantify respiration from roots of three C4 grasses (maize, Miscanthus, and switchgrass) grown in a site with a mixed cropping history where respiration from the breakdown of old soil carbon has a mixed C3-C4 signature. We used a Keeling plot approach to partition fluxes both at the soil surface using soil chambers and from the whole field using continuous flow sampling of air within and above the canopy. Although soil respiration rates from perennial grasses were higher than those from maize, the isotopic signature of respired carbon indicated that the fraction of soil CO2 flux attributable to current-year vegetation was 1.5 (switchgrass) to 2 (Miscanthus) times greater in perennials than that from maize, indicating that soil CO2 flux came mostly from roots and turnover of soil organic matter was reduced in the perennial crops.\nThis reduction in soil heterotrophic respiration, combined with the much greater quantities of C allocated belowground by perennial grasses compared to maize, suggests that perennial grasses grown as bioenergy crops may be able to provide an additional climate benefit by acting as carbon sinks in addition to reducing fossil fuel consumption.",

However, it is not clear why some CMEs have dimmings and some do not, nor is it clear how these dimmings relate to CME topology. The inner coronal coverage of SDO AIA and STEREO EUVI, combined with the extended field of view of PROBA2's SWAP imager, allow us the opportunity to map the topology of a dimming region in three dimensions into an erupting CME. Although the location and extent of a dimming region appears to be the best indicator of the inner \"footprint\" of a CME, the correlation is far from perfect. However, dimmings can provide vital clues about the development and 3D kinematics of a CME. This is particularly important as we are entering an extended period of time where STEREO coronagraph images will not always be available, and therefore the 3D properties of a CME will be difficult to deduce. Therefore, understanding the inner coronal manifestations of a CME can provide clues to its structure and dynamics, even without multi-viewpoint coronagraph observations. We present the results of this combined analysis effort, along with a discussion of how dimmings can be used in forecasting CME directions.",

            "abstract": "Massive icy bodies are important components of permafrost geosystems. In situ freezing of water in the ground by ice-segregation processes forms most of these icy bodies. Other hypotheses for the origin of massive ice include the burial of ice (e.g. glacier, snow, lake, river, sea). The analysis of ground-ice characteristics can give numerous clues about the geomorphologic processes and the thermal conditions at the time when permafrost developed. Massive underground ice therefore shows a great potential as a natural archive of the earth’s past climate. Identifying the origin of massive ice is a challenge for permafrost science since the different types of massive ice remain difficult to distinguish on the sole basis of field observations. There is actually no clear method to accurately assess the origin of massive ice and identification criteria need to be defined. The present study uses physico-chemical techniques to characterize buried glacier ice observed on Bylot Island, Nunavut. Combined to the analysis of cryostratigraphy, massive-ice cores crystallography and high-resolution imagery of the internal structure of the ice cores were obtained using micro-computed tomography techniques. These techniques are well suited for detailed descriptions (shape, size, orientation) of crystals, gas inclusions and sediment inclusions. Oxygen and hydrogen isotopes ratios of massive-ice cores were also obtained using common equilibrium technique. Preliminary results suggest the occurrence of two types of buried massive-ice of glacial origin similar to those found on contemporary glaciers: 1) Englacial ice: clear to whitish ice, with large crystals (cm) and abundant gas bubbles at crystal intersections; 2) Basal glacier ice: ice-rich, banded, micro-suspended to suspended cryostructures and ice-rich lenticular to layered cryostructures, with small ice crystals (mm) and a few disseminated gas bubbles. Glacier-derived permafrost contains antegenetic ice, which is ice that predates the aggradation of the permafrost. Remnants of glacier ice represent unique environmental archives and offer the possibility to reconstruct climate anterior to the formation of permafrost.",

NASA's Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) team prefers to perform regular, near-daily calibrations of range and angular biases of our sensor for the lengthy field deployments typical for Operation IceBridge (OIB). For the fall 2013 OIB deployment to McMurdo, we had to adapt our usual technique of regular overflights of an independently-surveyed airport parking ramp to deal with the fact that the McMurdo airfield was located on tidally-influenced sea ice, and that very few nearby durable surfaces were free of variable-depth snow during the OIB deployment. We detail our approach for dealing with these challenges, which included multiple GPS/vehicle surveys of the sea ice runway to quantify surface changes due to grooming operations, combined with GPS tide-gauge measurements of the runway's tidal motion. We also conducted a remote GPS/vehicle survey of a mostly snow-free road on Black Island, and included both sites during near-daily overflights with the ATM. We discuss the quantitative results of these surveys and the associated ATM overflights, and present conclusions for future deployments. Finally we discuss a related validation effort in which we compare ATM results from overflights of snow-free areas in the Dry Valleys with ATM surveys of the same area from a 2001 effort there.",

            "abstract": "While the importance of dispersal of windborne heavy particles such as seeds or pollen inside canopies is rarely disputed, the details needed to describe turbulent fluctuations in such applications continue to draw significant research attention. Turbulence and heavy-particle dispersal within canopies are sensitive to interactions between meteorological conditions and canopy structure as well as on particle shape and mass. In many applications, dispersal of heavy particles is required over a broad range of time scales ranging from hours to several decades thereby frustrating any attempt to resolve all aspects of turbulence. In recent years, Lagrangian stochastic trajectory models have been favored for predicting seed dispersal and are viewed as an acceptable compromise between empirical models with their ad-hoc parameterizations and computationally intensive Large Eddy Simulations. Here, an important feature of turbulence, namely the intermittency in dissipation rate, is incorporated into such trajectory models. Adding this effect has been recently shown to alter scalar dispersion patterns, especially in the far field. This method is applied here to heavy particles, where the long distance dispersal is deemed significant for many applications. This modeling approach was first evaluated using controlled laboratory experiments, where uniform-sized spheres were released within a canopy comprised of uniform cylinders inside a flume (see figure). The extended model that includes intermittency effects, as well as inertial drag forces on the particles, was shown to provide superior fit with the measured dispersal kernel than simpler models that add a constant settling velocity for each particle and/or do not include intermittency. The extended model results captured short distance dispersal and the heavy tails. Next the extended model was evaluated against a field experiment, where plant seeds were manually released inside a hardwood forest canopy (see figure). This experiment explored the extended approach in light of uncertainty in the flow and in canopy density inherent to all field conditions. Whether increased complexity of dispersal models leads to improved predictive skills under uncertainty inherently present across all field conditions is discussed.",

            "abstract": "A significant uncertainty in future land-surface carbon budgets is the response of wetlands to climate change. A corollary and related question is the future net climate (radiative) forcing impact from wetlands. Active wetlands emit both CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere. CH4 is, over a few decades, a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. CO2 has a longer atmospheric lifetime and a longer 'tail' to its radiative influence. Whether wetlands are a net source or sink of atmospheric carbon under future climate change will depend on ecosystem response to rising temperatures and elevated CO2. The largest uncertainty in future wetland C-budgets, and their climate forcing is the stability of the large below-ground carbon stocks, often in the form of peat, and the partitioning of CO2 and CH4 released via ecosystem respiration.\nIn advance of a long-term experimental warming and elevated CO2 manipulation at the DOE Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Climatic and Environmental Change (SPRUCE) site in the Marcell Experimental Forest, we have characterized the source of respired carbon used for both the production of CO2 and CH4. Samples were collected in early June, late July, and will be collected in early September from three large (~1.1 m2, ~0.5m3) chambers from the control plot, and two of the experimental plots selected for heating (+9°C, +4.5°C).\nEarly June fluxes from the three chambers were ~5500 mgC-m-2-d-1 and ~16 mgC-m-2-d-1 for CO2 and CH4 respectively. Radiocarbon analysis of CO2 and CH4 indicate that the source for the respired carbon is for the most part recent, with most 14C values between 30 and 40‰ – i.e., carbon that was photosynthetically fixed in the last few years. In concert with rising air and ground temperatures fluxes in late July increased to ~6500 mgC-m-2-d-1 and ~86 mgC-m-2-d-1. Although deep-heating was initiated in mid to late June we hypothesize that the July respiration signal is dominated by the regular seasonal cycle of natural warming.\nWe will present additional flux (September) and isotope (July, September) data and place the results in the context of next year’s experimental manipulations.\nThis work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.",

            "abstract": "Microorganisms comprise more than 90% of the biomass of the ocean. Their ability to thrive and survive in a wide range of environments from oligotrophic waters to the deep subsurface stems from the great metabolic versatility that exists among them. This metabolic versatility has further expanded with the discovery of extracellular electron transport (EET). EET is the capability of microorganisms to transfer electrons to and from insoluble substrates outside of the cell. Much of what is known about EET comes from studies of model metal reducing microorganisms in the groups Shewanellaceae and Geobacteraceae. However, EET is not limited to these metal reducing microorganisms, and may play a large role in the biogeochemical cycling of several elements. We have developed an electrochemical culturing technique designed to target microorganisms with EET ability and tested these methods in marine sediments. The use of electrodes allows for greater control and quantification of electrons flowing to insoluble substrates as opposed to insoluble substrates such as minerals that are often difficult to measure. We have recently shown that poising electrodes at different redox potentials will enrich for different microbial groups and thus possible metabolisms. In marine sediment microcosms, triplicate electrodes were poised at different cathodic (electron donating) potentials (-300, -400, -500 and -600 mV) and incubated for eight weeks. Community analysis of the 16S rRNA revealed that at lower negative potentials (-500 and -600 mV), more sulfate reducing bacteria in the class Deltaproteobacteria were enriched in comparison to the communities at -300 and -400 mV being dominated by microorganisms within Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Clostridia. This can be explained by sulfate (abundant in seawater) becoming a more energetically favorable electron acceptor with lower applied potentials. In addition, communities at higher potentials showed greater enrichment of the candidate division WS3. We are currently conducting enrichments at lower negative potentials to probe for other possible microbial groups capable of cathode oxidation. Our studies will contribute to the elucidation of the depth and breadth of EET across phylogenies and provide understanding to the extent of EET in nature.",

            "abstract": "Tributary confluences may significantly impact large-scale patterns of sediment transport because of their role in connecting individual streams in a network. These unique locations feature complex flow structures and geomorphic features, and may represent ecological hotspots. Sediment transport across confluences is poorly understood, however. We present research on coarse sediment transport and dispersion through confluences using sediment tracers in the East Fork Bitterroot River, Montana, USA. We tagged a range of gravel (>40 mm) and cobble particles with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags and painted smaller (10–40 mm) gravels, and then we traced them through confluences in a montane river’s headwaters. We measured the effects of confluences on dispersion, path length, and depositional location and compare properties of sediment routing with a non-confluence control reach. We also measured topographic change through repeat bed surveys and combined topography, hydraulics, and tracer measurements to calculate basal shear and critical Shields stresses for different grain sizes. Field observations suggest that tagged particles in confluences routed along flanks of scour holes in confluences, with sediment depositing further downstream along bank-lateral bars than within the channel thalweg. Travel distances of RFID-tagged particles ranged up to 35 meters from original seeding points, with initial recovery rates of RFID-tagged tracers ranging between 84-89%. In both confluence and control reaches only partial mobility was observed within the entire tracer population, suggesting a hiding effect imposed by the roughness of the bed. Particles seeded in the channel thalweg experienced further travel distances than those seeded towards the banks and on bars. Differences in dispersion between confluence and control reaches are implied by field observation. This study quantified patterns of sediment routing within confluences and provided insight to the importance of confluences in large-scale sediment transport through gravel-bed rivers.",

            "abstract": "The redox chemistry of Fe(III) and Fe(II) is tied to a variety of earth processes, including biological, chemical, or photochemical reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II). Each process may fractionate Fe isotopes, but the magnitudes of the kinetic isotope effects have not been greatly explored in laboratory conditions. Here, we present the isotopic fractionation of Fe during reduction experiments under a variety of experimental conditions including photochemical reduction of Fe(III) bound to EDTA or glucaric acid, and chemical reduction of Fe-EDTA by sodium dithionite, hydroxylamine hydrochloride, Mn(II), and ascorbic acid. A variety of temperatures and pHs were tested.\nIn all experiments, Fe(III) bound to an organic ligand was reduced in the presence of ferrozine. Ferrozine binds with Fe(II), forming a purple complex which allows us to measure the extent of reaction. The absorbance of the experimental solutions was measured over time to determine the Fe(II)-ferrozine concentration and thus the reduction rate. After about 5% of the Fe(III) was reduced, Fe(III)-EDTA and Fe(II)-ferrozine were separated using a C-18 column to which Fe(II)-ferrozine binds. The Fe(II) was eluted and purified through anion exchange chromatography for analysis of δ56Fe by MC-ICPMS.\nPreliminary results show that temperature and pH both affect reduction rate. All chemical reductants tested reduce Fe(III) at a greater rate as temperature increases. The photochemical reductant EDTA reduces Fe(III) at a greater rate under more acidic conditions. Comparison of the two photochemical reductants shows that glucaric acid reduces Fe(III) significantly faster than EDTA. For chemical reduction, the magnitude of isotopic fractionation depends on the reductant used. Temperature and pH also affect the isotopic fractionation of Fe. Experiments using chemical reductants show that an increase in temperature at low temperatures produces lighter 56Fe ratios, while at high temperatures some reductants produce heavier 56Fe ratios. The magnitude of isotope fractionation is not related to the reduction rate generalized over all reductants.\nThe measured isotopic fractionations produce δ56Fe from -3.82 to +3.05 across all of the reductants tested, highlighting the large impact that redox chemistry may have on fractionating Fe isotopes in the environment.",

            "abstract": "Oxygen availability controls many biological and geochemical processes, and serves as an important indicator of paleoceanographic characteristics. Recent work has demonstrated a direct relationship between oxygen acquisition and pores on benthic foraminiferal tests. Epifaunal foraminifera (living near or above the sediment-water interface) are directly exposed to bottom water, and can occur in abundance in a wide range of seafloor environments. In this study, a novel approach using ArcGIS and image analysis techniques was used to determine the percentage of test chamber surface area covered by pores in living and recently living (Rose Bengal stained) epifaunal taxa (Cibicides, Cibicidoides and Planulina). Analyses of Scanning Electron Microscope images of 97 specimens collected from 20 deep-sea locations having different bottom water oxygen concentrations (0.04 to 6.20 ml/L) revealed a robust (R2= 0.729; p < 0.001), negative relationship between pore surface area on test chambers and ambient bottom water oxygen concentration. The resulting calibration curve serves as new, quantitative proxy to assess bottom water oxygen of ancient oceans.",

            "abstract": "The influence of aerosols on ice water content (IWC) and rainrate has been suggested by some numerical simulations and observational studies. This is often complicated by a lack of contextual information regarding the dynamic structure and life cycle of the cloud systems. We investigate IWC and rainrate from deep convections (DC) using datasets from AURA Microwave Limb Sounder, CloudSat, Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, and International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project over the Congo, the Amazon, and South Asia during three different stages of lifecycle. We use measurements from AURA MLS to investigate the change in water content associated with the smaller sized ice crystals at anvil level and CloudSat to derive the relation between the amounts of larger sized ice crystals and rainrate with ambient aerosol loadings. We integrate reflectivity above freezing level (IZ) to calculate the amount of ice and differentiate reflectivity (DZ) with respect to altitude below the freeing level to estimate the attenuated rainfall under the cloud. Our analysis using the reflectivity data shows that IZ and DZ don’t change with aerosols loadings during the growing stage. However, IZ increases and DZ decreases, suggesting a delayed precipitation and increase of ice formation, during the matured stage. During the decaying stage, DZ increases, leading to a loss in larger ice particles or as shown by a decrease of the IZ above freezing level.\nIWC within the anvils of the DCs during their growing stage shows no significant relations with the ambient aerosol concentration over the Congo and South Asia. However, anvil IWC decreases during the matured stage over the South Asia and increase over the Congo as aerosol optical depth surrounding the DCs increases. Aerosol’s concentration plays an important role during the decaying stage and is significantly and positively correlated with the IWC of the anvils, suggesting an increase of smaller ice particles in convective anvils with aerosols.\nTogether with the result of CloudSat, our results supports the hypothesis that an increase of aerosols tend to invigorate large mesoscale deep convection by delaying precipitation and increasing both large and smaller ice particles in convective anvils during the mature phase, and increase precipitation during the decay phase.",

The labeled CO2 was mixed with ambient air and pumped into a small (2.5 m diameter and 1.4 m tall) juniper tree canopy . 10 L of the 13CO2 was sufficient to generate a stream of air at 20 L/min for 1 hour with a CO2 concentration of 540 ppm and a δ13C value of approximately 35,000‰. Plastic tarpaulins were used as a wind block. The 13CO2 –labeled air was applied to the canopy during peak photosynthesis between 10 and 11 am on June 30 2014 during which canopy air CO2 was elevated by approximately 10 ppm over ambient and had δ13C values ranging from 50 to 1000 ‰. Over the next three days, gas and tissue samples were collected in order to trace the 13C label through the juniper tree. Leaf and root samples collected from the labeled tree and from several control trees were loaded into exetainer vials, flushed with CO2-free air and incubated in the dark for 5 hours in order to measure the carbon isotope composition of respired CO2. Samples of soil pore space gas were collected from wells under the labeled tree and a control tree and were transported to the laboratory in He-flushed exetainer vials. The δ13C values of CO2 in the soil gas samples and in the headspace of incubation vials were measured using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. The δ13C values of foliar respiration were significantly higher than those of the control (by 3.6‰, p < 0.01) one and two days after labeling and δ13C values of root-respired CO2 were significantly higher (by 0.7‰, p = 0.01) than those of the control three days after labeling. In addition, δ13C values of soil respired CO2, determined from measurements of soil pore space CO2 at 50 cm three days after labeling, were significantly higher (by 0.7‰, p < 0.03)) for the labeled tree than control. The difference between δ13C values of soil respired CO2 under the labeled and control trees was not large enough to partition soil respiration into its component fluxes. However, these preliminary data show the potential for this method with longer labeling times to quantify the contribution of root respiration in soils, which has implications on models for soil CO2 in present day ecosystems and the geologic record.",

            "abstract": "We report spectral observations of upward propagating streamers, which normally start to develop after the development of downward propagating streamers. Optical emissions from downward propagating streamers have been documented by various photometric and spectral studies. One of the significant findings of these studies is that the N2+ first negative band emission – a direct evidence of ionization in sprites – is concentrated at the tips of downward propagating streamers, indicating that these narrow streamers are indeed nonlinear ionization waves, which parallels streamers observed in laboratory discharge experiments at ground pressure. However, upward propagating streamers have not been studied intensively compared to downward propagating streamers. This is mainly because it is difficult to isolate upward propagating streamers from the background luminosity: upward propagating streamers are normally spawned from existing luminous features, and the background luminosity of these features often contaminates the signals from upward propagating streamers. In spectral observation campaigns in 2009 and 2013, we have observed spectra from both downward and upward propagating streamers in two separate events. The observations were made with a high-speed slit-less spectrograph on-board the High-performance Instrumented Airborne Platform for Environmental Research (HIAPER), a research aircraft maintained and operated by NCAR. The spectra were obtained at a frame rate of 10,000 frames per second, at which the spectra from individual streamers can be temporally resolved. The data show that the fraction of blue emission – which we found mainly consisting of the N2 second positive band system – from the upward propagating streamers is smaller than that of the downward propagating streamers. This indicates that the electron energies in the upward propagating streamers is lower than that of the downward propagating streamers, which is consistent with an earlier photometric study [Adachi et al, 2006, doi:10.1029/2006GL026495]. Although our data set is very limited, we believe that this observational study makes another step forward in our understanding of the nature of upward propagating streamers.",

            "abstract": "The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is very sensitive to climate variations and is therefore an ideal study site to investigate past climate changes. Influenced by the Asian Monsoon system, the numerous lake systems on the TP serve as valuable archives for past hydrological changes, which are assumed to be caused by variations in strength and extent of the monsoonal impact.\nThe lacustrine record from the terminal lake Tangra Yumco (4540 m a.s.l., 31°13’N, 86°43’E) consists of an interbedding of fine-grained silty sediments with laminations of different thicknesses (sub-mm to cm) and partly intercalated blackish sandy layers. Thin section analysis in the laminated areas reveals cyclic laminations composed of a carbonate and a detrital layer. Homogenous intervals represent turbidite deposits which are further detected based on lithology, radiography as well as changes in the water content, grain size, Ti-values (XRF) and in the paleomagnetic parameter median destructive field.\nThe chronology is based on 27 AMS-radiocarbon ages on bulk organic matter and one piece of wood, which is of terrestrial origin. To determine a possible carbon reservoir effect, additional surface sediment samples and one modern aquatic plant were measured. The calculated reservoir effect of 2,120 +110/-90 years is assumed to be constant over the time and thus the base of the record reveals a corrected radiocarbon age of 17,270 +325/-310 cal BP. Additionally, investigations on paleomagnetic secular variations were carried out, showing that since 15,900 cal BP the record preserved a well-defined magnetization recording a genuine paleomagnetic signal.\nRegarding the geochemical (organic and inorganic), sedimentological, mineralogical and micropaleontological analyses, a low lake level with a high terrestrial input is observed for the Late Glacial. At 15.6 ka cal BP, a change in the sediment accumulation rate, increased allochthoneous input and changing ostracod fauna point to an increasing lake level. In the Early Holocene, a high lake level with a low salinity and low terrestrial input is observed. At 5,000 cal BP, the carbonate phase changes from calcite to aragonite, representing a higher evaporation rate and a falling lake level and a higher influence of terrestrial biomarkers.",

In the present study, at a micro-tidal coast of the Bay of Bengal, δ18O and δD have been used to delineate the seasonal patterns of discharging terrestrial-sourced groundwater to the sea. Further, the stable isotopes are also being used to qualify and quantify the groundwater-seawater mixing and interactions. Seasonal, multi-depth pore water samples (0 to 105 cm) were collected from a transect that is perpendicular to the high tide line (HTL), and runs for 110 m towards the offshore. Stable isotope composition of the pore water demonstrate significant seasonal variability in the source of the discharging groundwater ( δ18O ranges: -8.98‰ and +1.82‰, δD ranges: -68‰ and +10.8‰). Seawater during the same period showed a δ18O range of -1.1‰ and +1.92‰, Consistent patterns of relatively isotopically-depleted pore waters (δ18O <-4.0‰) were observed at certain parts of the transect, suggesting preferential groundwater discharge zones in those areas that may be dictated by the hydraulic gradients, flow paths and aquifer properties. The gradient of the linear, best-fit trend line of the δ18O-δD bivariate plot for all of the pore water samples were found to be lower than the local or global meteoric water lines. Such a low slope may indicate discharge and/or mixing of terrestrially-sourced groundwater that have not been directly recharged from precipitation water along local flow paths. Most of the relatively δD depleted groundwater were found up to 40 m distance offshore from the HTL, probably suggesting the extent of terrestrially-sourced discharging groundwater that are undergoing mixing with the re-circulated marine-sourced pore water.",

Sending an instrument of this type into a never-seen particle environment requires extensive characterization prior to launch to establish sufficient measurement accuracy and instrument response. To reach this end, a slew of tests for allowing SPC to see ranges of appropriate ions and electrons, as well as a facility that reproduces solar photon spectra and fluxes for this mission. Having already tested the SPC at flight like temperatures with no significant modification of the noise floor, we recently completed a round of particle testing to see if the deviations in Faraday Cup design fundamentally change the operation of the instrument.

The error of estimating and simulating fluxes due to extant heterogeneity is commonly overlooked in regional and global estimates. Here we evaluate the pattern and controls on spatial heterogeneity on CH4 and CO2 fluxes over varying spatial scales. Data from the north slope of Alaska from chambers, up to a 16 year CO2 flux record from up to 7 permanent towers, over 20 portable tower locations, eddy covariance CH4 fluxes over several years and sites, new year-around CO2 and CH4 flux installations, hundreds of hours of aircraft concentration and fluxes, and terrestrial biosphere and flux inverse modeling, are used to evaluate the spatial variability of fluxes and to better estimate regional fluxes. Significant heterogeneity of fluxes is identified at varying scales from sub-meter scale to >100km.\nA careful consideration of the effect that heterogeneity causes when estimating ecosystem fluxes is critical to reliable regional and global estimates. The combination of eddy covariance tower flux, aircraft, remote sensing, and modeling can be used to provide reliable, accurate, regional assessments of CH4 and CO2 fluxes from large areas of heterogeneous landscape.",

Hyperspectral remote sensing has proved to be valuable for estimation of vegetation biophysical parameters such as biomass using different statistical techniques. However, in statistical analysis of hyperspectral data, multicollinearity is a common problem due to large amount of correlated hyper-spectral reflectance measurements. The aim of this study was to examine the prospect of above ground biomass estimation in a heterogeneous Mediterranean rangeland employing multivariate calibration methods. Canopy spectral measurements were made in the field using a GER 3700 spectroradiometer, along with concomitant in situ measurements of above ground biomass for 170 sample plots. Multivariate calibrations including partial least squares regression (PLSR), principal component regression (PCR), and Least-Squared Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) were used to estimate the above ground biomass. The prediction accuracy of the multivariate calibration methods were assessed using cross validated R2 and RMSE. The best model performance was obtained using LS_SVM and then PLSR both calibrated with first derivative reflectance dataset with R2cv = 0.88 & 0.86 and RMSEcv= 1.15 & 1.07 respectively. The weakest prediction accuracy was appeared when PCR were used (R2cv = 0.31 and RMSEcv= 2.48). The obtained results highlight the importance of multivariate calibration methods for biomass estimation when hyperspectral data are used.",

The ethanol is produced in over 200 fuel ethanol refineries across the country. In this work, we report measurements of the atmospheric emissions from the third largest fuel ethanol refinery in the U.S. located in Decatur, Illinois. Measurements were made from the NOAA WP-3D research aircraft during the NOAA Southeast Nexus (SENEX) campaign in the summer of 2013, which was part of the larger Southeast Atmosphere Study (SAS). Emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) agreed with reported emissions in the 2011 National Emissions Inventory (NEI-2011). In contrast, emissions of several volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including ethanol, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, were underestimated by an order of magnitude in the NEI-2011. By combining data from the NEI-2011 and fuel ethanol production numbers from the Renewable Fuels Association, we calculate emission intensities for SO2, NOx and VOCs, defined as the emissions per volume of fuel produced. These emission intensities can be readily compared to fuel-based emission factors from gasoline vehicles and the relative contributions made by fuel refining and fuel use to overall emissions will be quantified. Emission intensities of SO2 and NOx are particularly high for those fuel ethanol refineries that use coal as an energy source, including the plant in Decatur studied in this work. Finally, by comparing the measurements at different distances downwind, chemical transformation of the emissions could be observed, including the formation of new particles, peroxyacyl nitrates, ozone and sulfate aerosol.",

            "abstract": "In general, a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is produced either digitizing existing maps and elevation values are interpolated from the contours, or elevation information is collected from stereo imagery on digital photogrammetric workstations. Both methods produce a DEM to the required specification, but each method contains a variety of possible production scenarios, and each method results in DEM cells with totally different character. Common artifacts found in DEM are missing-values at different location which can influence the output of the application that uses this particular DEM.\nIn this work we introduce a numerically-stable multiscale scheme to evaluate the missing-value DEM's quantity of interest (elevation, slope, etc.). This method is very efficient for the case when dealing with large high resolution DEMs that cover large area, resulting in O(106-1010) data points. Our scheme relies on graph-based algorithms and low-rank approximations of the entire adjacency matrix of the DEM's graph. When dealing with large data sets such as DEMs, the Laplacian or kernel matrix resulted from the interaction of the data points is stupendously big. One needs to identify a subspace that capture most of the action of the kernel matrix. By the application of a randomized projection on the graph affinity matrix, a well-conditioned basis is identified for it numerical range. This basis is later used in out-of-sample extension at missing-value location.\nIn many cases, this method beats its classical competitors in terms of accuracy, speed, and robustness.",

Currently, OBSIP has deployed and recovered the instruments for years 1, 2, and 3 of the experiment. Year 4 instrumentation is currently collecting data on the ocean floor until fall 2015.\nThree OBSIP Institutional Instrument Contributors (IIC’s) designed and built 60 new Ocean Bottom Seismometers (OBSs) specifically for the unique requirements of the Cascadia region, including shallow water deployments and heavy fishing activity. Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) and Scripps Institute of Oceanography (SIO) both designed new trawl-resistant frames for the OBS instruments. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) built 15 new deep-water instruments. To aid in the recovery of the heavy trawl resistant enclosures, OBSIP uses a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV). Cascadia OBS instruments include a seismometer, either a differential pressure gauge (DPG) or an absolute pressure sensor (APG), and extensive supporting electronics.\nOne of the goals of the Cascadia Initiative is to encourage the joint use of onshore and offshore data. To support this goal, OBSIP has assembled a Horizontal Orientations report and an ARRA white paper summarizing the Cascadia Initiative performance. In both of these reports, OBSIP investigated the noise characteristics of the Cascadia OBS stations and the overall performance. With new instrumentation packages, the Cascadia instruments can be deployed in shallow water. OBSIP has investigated instrument performance to determine if water depth, instrument shielding, and recording season influence data quality.",

            "abstract": "The role of Pacific Ocean SST anomalies for multi-decadal droughts in southwestern US was examined for case-studies within a 900 year global climate model simulation. Decadal precipitation variability in southwestern US is partly attributable to SST variability. In this region, however, atmospheric intrinsic variability can also induce long-term, low-frequency precipitation variability without ocean feedbacks. This suggests that some long-term droughts are driven by stochastic processes, and are not predictable based on the pattern of SST forcing. This study examines individual drought events in a perfect model scenario, in order to resolve the relative role of ocean forcing as compared to internal variability and land feedbacks.\nEnsemble experiments with NCAR's Community Earth System Model (CESM) were used to explore the reproducibility of long-term droughts for southwestern US. Potential predictability of four multi-decadal droughts identified in the control simulation depends on the region or seasonality of precipitation anomalies, and the dominance of local moisture recycling as compared to oceanic driven circulation patterns. When ocean feedbacks are permitted, ensemble predictions initialized at the beginning of multi-decadal droughts fail to capture the upcoming precipitation anomaly, suggesting that atmospheric internal variability and/or land-feedbacks dominate the generation of these low-frequency precipitation anomalies. However, when western US multi-decadal droughts occur near the coast during winter, coincident with negative tropical and positive north Pacific Ocean SST anomalies, the precipitation anomalies can be reproduced by prescribing the SST forcing pattern for the atmospheric model. These case-studies suggest some predictability from recurrent SST anomalies for long-term droughts of certain characteristics. This has implications for analysis of the most recent drought in California, brought about by a La Nina-like Pacific Ocean SST pattern, and resulting in more than a decade of devastating impacts. Future development of effective forecasting methods requires further understanding of the relative roles of internal variability, ocean forcing and land feedbacks in the generation and persistence of various long-term droughts in southwestern US.",

            "abstract": "Strike-slip fault zones have long been known for characteristic landforms such as offset and deflected rivers, linear strike-parallel valleys, and shutter ridges. Despite their common presence, questions remain about the mechanics of how these landforms arise or how their form varies as a function of slip rate, geomorphic process, or material properties. We know even less about what happens far from the fault, in drainage basin headwaters, as a result of strike-slip motion. Here we explore the effects of horizontal fault slip rate, bedrock erodibility, and hillslope diffusivity on river catchments that drain across an active strike-slip fault using the CHILD landscape evolution model. Model calculations demonstrate that lateral fault motion induces a permanent state of landscape disequilibrium brought about by fault offset-generated river lengthening alternating with abrupt shortening due to stream capture. This cycle of shifting drainage patterns and base level change continues until fault motion ceases thus creating a perpetual state of transience unique to strike-slip systems. Our models also make the surprising prediction that, in some cases, hillslope ridges oriented perpendicular to the fault migrate laterally in conjunction with fault motion. Ridge migration happens when slip rate is slow enough and/or diffusion and river incision are fast enough that the hillslopes can respond to the disequilibrium brought about by strike-slip motion. In models with faster slip rates, stronger rocks or less-diffusive hillslopes, ridge mobility is limited or arrested despite the fact that the process of river lengthening and capture continues. Fast-slip cases also develop prominent steep fault-facing hillslope facets proximal to the fault valley and along-strike topographic profiles with reduced local relief between ridges and valleys. Our results demonstrate the dynamic nature of strike-slip landscapes that vary systematically with a ratio of bedrock erodibility (K) and hillslope diffusivity (D) to the rate of horizontal advection of topography (v). These results also reveal a potential set of recognizable geomorphic signatures within strike-slip systems that should be looked to as indicators of fault activity and/or material properties.",

To this end, with the assistance of the Enlil model and GHOSTkit analytical tools, we are investigating how variations in launch location affect geoeffectivness. We have begun our investigation by creating a grid of Enlil runs representing a CME impact domain. Specifically, we are investigating the halo CME of 06 October 2013, and establishing an impact domain of Enlil runs with CME launch locations from -45 degrees to +45 degrees (north/south and east/west) in 5 degree increments. This domain provides us sufficient data to see variations in critical values of interest. With a goal of identifying how errors in measurements affect space weather forecasts, variations at 1AU for density, velocity, magnetic field, temperature, beta, and epsilon are being investigated to see if any useful patterns in the resulting solar wind can be identified. Once useful information is identified, the analysis will be performed on additional events in an attempt to validate our findings.",

In combination with strong plume convection (including pyro-convection), this permits injection of volatile, normally short-lived species to the free troposphere and beyond. Measurements from the Charged-coupled device Actinic Flux Spectroradiometers (CAFS) onboard the NASA DC-8 aircraft show penetration of the California Rim fire reduced in situ ozone photolysis by as much as 95% and nitrogen dioxide photolysis by 80%.

            "abstract": "In order to curb anthropogenic CO2 emissions, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology has been put forward as a way to achieve a large reduction in emissions by capturing CO2 at source, transporting it and injecting it into the subsurface for geological storage. Suitable formations considered for CO2 storage are depleted oil and gas fields, saline aquifers and coal seams. The former are particularly of interest due to the presence of an existing surface and subsurface infrastructure, detailed understanding of the reservoir-caprock system and low pore pressures prior to CO2 injection. However, prerequisite to ensuring safe, long-term storage of CO2is maintaining caprock integrity, by preventing fracturing of the caprock, as well as by ensuring stability of any pre-existing faults cutting the seal.\nMany potential depleted hydrocarbon fields under consideration for CCS, and most current CCS sites, are capped by shaly caprocks. The complex nature of this rock type, both mineralogically, hydraulically and mechanically, combined with the highly reactive properties of CO2-rich fluids, makes for an interesting, yet difficult, system to investigate. On the short-term, it has been shown that CO2 can lead to swelling of (swelling) clays present in the shale matrix, which may lead to the generation of outward-directed swelling forces. In addition, on the long-term (100-1000’s of years), CO2/brine/rock interactions may lead to mineralogical changes in the material. Such processes can lead to changes in the mechanical and frictional behavior of shale, which may or may not enhance loss of containment in response to the new state of stress resulting from CO2injection.\nWe studied the effect of these long-term chemical alterations on the mechanical properties of intact shale and clay-rich faults. Our study focused both on typical shale analogues, such as the Opalinus Clay (Mont Terri, Switzerland), as well as clay-rich caprock obtained from a natural CO2 field (Green River, Utah, USA), which was exposed to CO2 for > 400 ky. We performed mechanical experiments, using a novel technique, to study the behavior of intact, low permeability rocks, as well as shear experiments to understand the frictional stability of simulated fault gouges. This presentation will give an overview of the results obtained to date.",

            "abstract": "The ultimate drivers of convection - radiation, tropospheric humidity and surface fluxes – are altered both by the large-scale circulation and by convection itself. A quantity to which all drivers of convection contribute is moist static energy, or gross moist stability, respectively. Therefore, a variance analysis of the moist static energy budget in radiative-convective equilibrium helps understanding the interaction of precipitating convection and the large-scale environment. In addition, this method provides insights concerning the impact of convective aggregation on this coupling. As a starting point, the interaction is analyzed with a general circulation model, but a model intercomparison study using a hierarchy of models is planned. Effective coupling parameters will be derived from cloud resolving models and these will in turn be related to assumptions used to parameterize convection in large-scale models.",

            "abstract": "Global climate models predict amplified warming at high latitudes, where permafrost soils have historically acted as a carbon sink. As warming occurs, the seasonally thawed active layer will propagate downward into previously frozen mineral-rich soil, releasing carbon and introducing unique chemical weathering signatures into rivers. We use variations in the 87Sr/86Sr, δ13CDIC, δ44/40Ca, and major ion geochemistry of rivers to track seasonal active layer dynamics. We collected water from six streams on the North Slope of Alaska between May and October, 2009 and 2010. All rivers drain continuous permafrost but three drain tussock tundra-dominated watersheds and three drain steeper bedrock catchments with minor tundra coverage. In tundra streams, elevated 87Sr/86Sr ratios, low δ13CDIC values and major ions ([Na+]+[K+]/ [Ca+2]+[Mg+2]) in spring melt runoff suggest flushing of shallow soils with relatively low carbonate content. By July, 87Sr/86Sr ratios stabilize at relatively low values and δ13CDIC at relatively higher values, indicating the active layer thawed into deeper carbonate-rich soils. In bedrock streams, elevated 87Sr/86Sr ratios correlate with high discharge. By late fall, bedrock stream 87Sr/86Sr ratios decrease steadily, consistent with increased carbonate weathering. Nearly constant δ13CDIC values and high [SO4-2] for most of the melt season imply significant sulfuric acid-carbonate weathering in bedrock streams. δ13CDIC values suggest a shift to carbonic acid-carbonate weathering in late 2010, possibly due to limited oxygen for pyrite oxidation during freezing of the active layer. δ44/40Ca values in both tundra and bedrock streams increase during the seasons, suggesting increased uptake of 40Ca by plants. δ44/40Ca values of rivers are at least 0.1-0.2‰ higher than their watershed soils, rocks and sediments, suggesting significant plant uptake. Our findings show how seasonal changes in mineral weathering have potential for tracking active layer dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Coal is the largest fossil fuel resource in the United States. Most of this coal is deep in the subsurface making it costly and potentially dangerous to extract. However, in many of these deep coal seams, methane, the main component of natural gas, has been discovered and successfully harvested. Coal bed methane (CBM) currently accounts for approximately 7.5% of the natural gas produced in the U.S. Combustion of natural gas produces substantially less CO2 and toxic emissions (e.g. heavy metals) than combustion of coal or oil thereby making it a cleaner energy source. In the large coal seams of the Powder River Basin (PRB) in southeast Montana and northeast Wyoming, CBM is produced almost entirely by biogenic processes. The in situ conversion of coal to CBM by the native microbial community is of particular interest for present and future natural gas sources as it provides the potential to harvest energy from coal seams with lesser environmental impacts than mining and burning coal.\nResearch at Montana State University has shown the potential for enhancing the subsurface microbial processes that produce CBM. Long-term batch enrichments have investigated the methane enhancement potential of yeast extract as well as algal and cyanobacterial biomass additions with increased methane production observed with all three additions when compared to no addition. Future work includes quantification of CBM enhancement and normalization of additions. This presentation addresses the options thus far investigated for increasing CBM production and the next steps for developing the enhanced in situ conversion of coal to CBM.",

Reclamation operates 337 reservoirs with a total storage capacity of 245 million acre-feet and operates 53 hydroelectric powerplants that annually produce, on average for the past 10 years, 40 billion kilowatt-hours. Reclamation is adapting to the impacts and future challenges posed by the changing climate through the development of new climate services as well as through cooperation with Federal, state, local, tribal, academic, and non-governmental partners in the use of climate and water resource information that may be available. Reclamation is utilizing this information within a strategy that has four goals: 1) Increase Water Management Flexibility, 2) Enhance Climate Adaptation Planning, 3) Improve Infrastructure Resiliency, and 4) Expand Information Sharing. Within this presentation we will focus on the utilization of climate services within each of these key goals of Reclamation’s strategy. This includes the utilization of climate information to track and potentially improve reservoir management to increase water management flexibility, the development of climate informed hydrology that supports climate adaptation planning, use of climate information to inform decisions of infrastructure resilience, and climate services use for jointly informed water management decisions through education and web based services.",

            "abstract": "The equations that describe mantle convection, under the assumption of incompressibility and the Boussinesq approximation, are the Stokes equations for the velocity and pressure fields, and a nonlinear advection-diffusion equation for the temperature field. We discuss the simulation of the mantle convection equations using the Hybridized Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method.\nThe discontinuous Galerkin method (DG) is a high-order method that has been used extensively in the last few years. DG methods combine the advantages of continuous Galerkin finite element methods (CG) and finite volume methods (FVM), being able to handle complex geometries like CG and maintaining local conservative properties like FVM. However, the DG method suffers from the problem of large memory requirements. This is due to the number of unknowns in the system increasing as O((p+1)^d N) where p is the order of the local polynomial, d is the spatial dimension, and N is the number of elements in the triangulation. For d>1, high-order polynomials will lead to a rapid increase in memory requirements. In HDG, the globally coupled unknowns are the degrees of freedom belonging to the unknown functions on the edges (or faces) of the elements instead of the interior of the elements. The number of unknowns now increases as O((p+1)^(d-1)E), where E is the number of edges in the triangulation.\nIn HDG the approximate variables and the corresponding approximate fluxes are expressed in terms of the approximate traces of the variables on the element faces. Unique values of these traces are defined by enforcing the continuity of the normal component of the fluxes across element faces. We present implementations of the HDG method for the Stokes system and the unsteady nonlinear advection diffusion equation. We discuss the convergence properties of the various HDG implementations presented and technqiues that have been developed for improving these convergence properties. We also present results from running the code against various benchmarks, and discuss the performance of the HDG method in addressing the overshoot phenomenon observed in advection dominated problems with steep gradients. Finally we present scaling results for our implementation of the HDG method.",

The generally clean character of renewable energies provides a great synergy and complimentary attribute for Native Americans’ respect and pride for the environment and the overarching concern for future generations (Council, Pierce et al. 2000). Furthermore, Native American cultures have a strong creative and artistic focus, often motivated by their respect and appreciation for nature.\nThe purpose of this learning-based research is to apply a cross-disciplinary approach to integrate the humanities with STEM research within the context of solar energy and climate literacy. Using 7 different learning styles (visual, aural, verbal, physical, logical, social, and solitary), students have the opportunity to showcase their research efforts through a variety of modes and artifacts including graphic novel development (Visual), spoken word poetry (Aural), conference presentation (Verbal), experiential display and demonstration (Physical), debate (Logical), social media and viral messaging (Social), and article submission (Solitary).",

            "abstract": "The IRIS Data Management Center (DMC) hosts mature web service interfaces that allow easy access to the vast archive of seismological and other data at the DMC. The core web services are conformant with the standard adopted by the International Federation of Digital Seismograph Networks (FDSN) and provide access to time series, related metadata and earthquake parameters. With an increasing number of seismological data centers offering these same interfaces for their data sets, end users may use the same software to access data across data centers. Leveraging these standardized interfaces at multiple data centers, the DMC has developed a route resolution system that provides the routing logic to facilitate federated data access. The system comprises one interface that provides routing information for time series requests and another that provides routing information for metadata requests. These route resolution services accept requests as they would be submitted to an FDSN web service and return the selection separated into requests to be submitted to appropriate data centers. Using these services, a data access client can easily determine which portions of any given request should be directed to which data center. The routing results are returned in a form that is ready to be submitted to appropriate data centers, allowing multi-data center access to be integrated into even the simplest access software. Support for these routing services will be added to data access clients supported by the DMC. In addition to illustrating the details of this federation support system, we will present the status of other web service systems and data access methods at the DMC.\n\nIRIS DMC Web Services: http://service.iris.edu",

The UK has a long history of severe coastal flooding, with major events including those that occurred in 1607, 1703 and 1953. The problems associated with coastal flooding again reached the forefront during the latest winter of 2013-2014 when the UK experienced a series of very severe events. What is noteworthy about this most recent winter period is the: (1) large number of significantly coastal flooding events occurring one after another over a relatively short period of time; and (2) the large areas of coastline affected. Extreme events are rarely assessed in terms of ‘clustering’, despite the fact this leads to amplified flood damages. The spatial dependence in flood hazard (i.e. simultaneous flooding in multiple locations) is now receiving more attention, motivated by concern from re-insurance, infrastructure reliability and emergency response, but understanding in this area is still limited. In this paper we assess extreme high water events and their temporal clustering and footprint around the UK, using records from the UK national network of 40 tide gauges, the longest of which extends back 100 years. We identify 100 distinct events, during which water levels exceeded the 1 in 5 year return period. We examine these events in detail and assess the coastal flooding that occurred during each event.",

            "abstract": "The Mg isotopic composition (δ26MgDSM3) of pore fluids and bulk carbonates from ODP Sites 762B, 807A, and 806B are presented. The objective of this study is to elucidate the major controls on marine pore fluid δ26Mg, specifically the effect of authigenic clay precipitation in carbonate-rich sediments. Such studies are important for quantifying the leverage that exists in carbonate section to drive diagenetic alteration, and also for identifying geochemical reactions occurring in deep marine sediments that may impact the global geochemical cycles of elements such as Ca and Mg.\n The general pore fluid δ26Mg trend at each of the three sites is a systematic increase with depth. In the upper ~108 m sections of all three sites, the pore fluid δ26Mg gradually increases from the modern seawater value (-0.80 ± 0.04 ‰) to -0.54 ± 0.08 ‰ (807A and 806B) and -0.39± 0.04 ‰ (762B). Below ~110 mbsf at both 807A and 762B, pore fluid δ26Mg decreases noticeably by ~ 0.1‰, while pore fluids at 806B exhibit a continual, gradual increase in δ26Mg to -0.17‰ at 679.9 mbsf.\n Simple reactive transport modeling suggests that the general increase in pore fluid δ26Mg with depth is likely explained by diffusion and calcite recrystallization. However, diffusive communication with an isotopically distinct lower boundary alone cannot explain the observed shifts of -0.1‰ in pore fluid δ26Mg at depth, unless there is an increase in fractionation factor (from 0.9960 to 0.9995) associated with reaction between the sediment and pore fluid. Mineralogical evidence from Site 762B indicates that the Mg isotopic shift in the pore fluids occurs at a depth interval (between 106.8 mbsf and 135.3 mbsf) where clay (mainly illite and smectite) content increases from 3% to 11%, CaCO3 content decreases from 92% to 86%, and porosity decreases by ~20%. The isotopic and mineralogical data are consistent with the formation of secondary clays that preferentially sequesters isotopically heavy Mg into the solid phase, implying that clay precipitation is relevant to the geochemical evolution of pore fluids even in carbonate-rich sedimentary columns. More detailed reactive transport modeling that includes reactions between pore fluids and both calcite and clay minerals is employed to constrain clay reaction rates and an empirical fractionation factor associated with clay precipitation.",

            "abstract": "Located in the remote marine free troposphere, the Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO) represents a clean airshed that can be used to study anthropogenic pollution influences and long-range transport of aerosol particles from the Asian mainland. Because of the global nature of Asian dust storms, the radiative properties of these particles transported long-range can significantly impact global climate. It has been proposed that aerosols transported to MLO during upslope wind conditions (typically daytime) are local in origin while aerosols transported during downslope conditions (typically nighttime) represent long-range transport in the free troposphere.\nTwelve PM10 samples (six daytime/nightime pairs) were collected on polycarbonate filters for 72 hours each between March 15 and April 26, 2011. Bulk samples of dust from local sources (road dust, parking lot, lava fields) were collected as well in order to assess the PM10 contribution from local dusts. On March 19-20 the Korea Meteorological Administration documented a significant dust event over the Korean peninsula. Back-trajectory analyses from MLO coupled with local wind speed and wind direction data suggest that this dust event may have been captured during the MLO sampling campaign. MLO samples were analyzed by computer-controlled scanning electron microscopy (CCSEM) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) and particles were sorted into compositionally-distinct particle types which were then compared across the sample set. Concentrations of particle types expected to be associated with Asian dust were observed to peak in one pair of daytime/nighttime samples collected between March 22 and March 28. Manual microscopic characterization of suspected Asian dust particles and local dust particles was carried out using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) in conjunction with EDX and focussed ion beam SEM (FIB-SEM) in an effort to characterize differences in physicochemical or radiative properties of local versus long-range transported particles. FIB-SEM analysis allows for the 3-dimensional reconstruction of the composition of selected particles. Particle optical properties are then calculated from the 3-D reconstructions.",

            "abstract": "This study presents the precipitation variability in São Paulo state/Brazil considering the climate demand for high sugarcane productivity. The Brazilian sugarcane and the bioethanol chain are facing an increase demand in response of the biofuel industry expansion. The productivity improvement is the key point to face the challenges about the land expansion in the Brazilian agriculture. The sugarcane phenology is climate dependent even being efficient in the decarboxylation process. The sprouting, growing, yield and the sugar content are determined by the climate. The accumulated rainy days during the pre harvest or more than 180 days of dry period can reduce the sugar content during the maturation process. Daily rainfall time series for the period 1960-2003 from 210 rain gauges at São Paulo state - the major Brazilian producer - are used. We subset the time series in the annual, seasonal, ten-day totals and dry and wet spells analysis. We used the mann- kendall non-parametric test to calculate the trends. The annual, the seasonal totals and the dry and wet spells did not showed a significant change in time. However, the ten-day total analysis in the beginning of the rainy season - i.e. in October - showed an interesting changing pattern - 24% of gauges showed a significant negative trend (p_value<0.1). These gauges are located in specific regions with the highest sugarcane production. Also, the October totals showed significant and negative trends (p_value<0.1) for more than 95% of precipitation gauges. These results are strongly indicating a longer dry season in the last twenty years. These changes in the precipitation variability can be related with the instability of the sugarcane market in Brazil in the last years.",

            "abstract": "Several aspects of real time forecast of Indian summer monsoon (ISM) in 3-4 pentad lead time (extended range) are discussed in this study to explore the operational capability of the Climate forecast system model version 2 (CFSv2) developed by NCEP. 2013 summer monsoon was a near excess monsoon year in terms of seasonal mean and was a result of rich diversity of phenomena including strong intraseasonal variations and intense northward propagations over the Indian region. 11 member forecasts were made at every 5 day interval during the June-September monsoon season which included monsoon onset and withdrawal phases. The ensemble members were created by perturbing the initial conditions at each start time. In addition to the CFSv2 forecasts, we also carried out forecasts using the atmospheric only component (GFSv2) forced with CFSv2 derived sea surface temperature subjected to a bias correction based on historical observations (GFSbc runs).\nBoth the CFSv2 and GFSbc runs were able to predict the progression of ISM over the Indian region and the subsequent intraseasonal oscillations (active and break phases). The analysis for an extreme event (Uttarakhand flood) and monsoon revival towards the end of the season were also performed. Comparison between the two runs shows that active and break spells were predicted with good fidelity over the Indian region, though GFSbc outperforms CFSv2 on several occasions. Thus, improvement of the operational monsoon forecast over Indian region using NCEP CFSv2 require better representation of air-sea interaction and mean states of ocean.",

            "abstract": "A complication in geophysical monitoring of deep mines is the high-stress dependency of the physical properties of hard rocks. In-mine observations show anisotropic variability of the in situ P- and S-wave velocities and resistivity of the hard rocks that are likely related to stress field changes. As part of a comprehensive study in a deep, highly stressed mine located in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, data from in situ monitoring of the seismicity, conductivity, stress, and stress dependent physical properties has been obtain. In-laboratory experiments are also being performed on borehole cores from the Sudbury mines. These experiments will measure the Norite borehole core's properties including elastic modulus, bulk modulus, P- and S-wave velocities, and density. Hydraulic fracturing has been successfully implemented in industries such as oil and gas and enhanced geothermal systems, and is currently being investigated as a potential method for preconditioning in mining. However, further research is required to quantify how hydraulic fractures propagate through hard, unfractured rock as well as naturally fractured rock typically found in mines. These in laboratory experiments will contribute to a hydraulic fracturing project evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of hydraulic fracturing as a method of de-stressing hard rock mines. A tri-axial deformation cell equipped with 18 Acoustic Emission (AE) sensors will be used to bring the borehole cores to a tri-axial state of stress. The cores will then be injected with fluid until the the hydraulic fracture has propagated to the edge of the core, while AE waveforms will be digitized continuously at 10 MHz and 12-bit resolution for the duration of each experiment. These laboratory hydraulic fracture experiments will contribute to understanding how parameters including stress ratio, fluid injection rate, and viscosity, affect the fracturing process.",

            "abstract": "Substantial natural contamination from trace elements (like arsenic) and pathogens make Ganges Deltaic aquifers an area of utmost concern. Following millions of cases of chronic arsenic poisoning from the groundwaters of the region, numerous residents are still knowingly ingesting water from shallow to intermediate accessible depth drinking water wells. Added to the calamity of arsenic is the prevalence of pathogenic bacteria in these waters. The increasing frequency of gastroenteritis signifies the need to quantify the magnitude and extensiveness of health degrading agents--bacterial pathogens (i.e. Salmonella) and non-pathogens (i.e. Enterobacteriaceae) --within the water supply in accessible Gangetic aquifers. To assess the dissolved microbiological quality in the region, present study sampling locations are along defined piezometer nests in an area in SE Asia (Bangladesh). Every nest contains samples from wells at varying depths covering shallow to deep aquifers. To date, 17 of the 76 water samples were analyzed for Salmonella, generic Escherichia coli (E. coli) and coliforms. Briefly, samples were plated in duplicate onto E. coli/Coliform petrifilm and incubated at 370C for 48 hours. Next, each sample was enriched in buffered peptone water and incubated at 370C for 18 hours. Bacterial DNA was extracted and amplified using a qPCR machine. Amplification plots were analyzed to determine presence/absence of microorganisms. All water samples (n=~76) are analyzed for Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria spp. and Shigella. Pathogen populations of PCR-positive water samples are enumerated using the agar direct plate method. Non-pathogenic bacterial indicator organisms (i.e. Enterobacteriaceae) will also be enumerated. Over the course of the experiment, we hypothesize that shallower wells will 1)have a higher pathogen prevalence and 2)harbor pathogens and nonpathogens at higher concentrations. While the 17 samples analyzed to date were negative for Salmonella, and E. coli, we anticipate subsequent sample analyses may reveal, E. coli or pathogenic (i.e. Salmonella) contamination due to livestock and anthropogenic wastes in the area. With farmers using shallow depth aquifers to irrigate crops, there is a very real threat of foodborne illness and the risk to public health is great.",

            "abstract": "Observations in different subduction zones have suggested that overpressured fluids nearby the plate interface are closely related to the origin of nonvolcanic tremors (NVT) and low frequency earthquakes (LFE). The physics of the plate interface would strongly differ depending on whether NVT and LFE triggering is produced by fluid migration due to the SSE strain field or, to the long-term fluid emplacement induced by the slip transients. In this work we study the migration of confined fluids in the subducted Cocos plate during two SSE in Guerrero. To this purpose we coupled the evolution of the 3D strain field induced by the silent events of 2006 and 2009-2010 with the 2D poroelastic equation for fluid transport. We considered the SSE slip history determined by previous authors through the inversion of GPS data and used a 3D finite difference code to compute the evolution of the associated confining pressure in the crust. As a result, we obtained the velocity vectors of the fluids within the top 5 km of the Cocos plate (i.e., slab) assuming typical permeability values from 1x10-9-1x10-16 m2 reported in the literature for the oceanic crust. For the 2006 SSE, two low-pressure zones acting as fluid “attraction poles” arise at 150-175 and 200-230 km from the trench, with diffusion velocities ranging between 10-3 and 10-9 km/day. These zones surprisingly agree with the regions where NVTs are systematically observed during the occurrence of the SSEs. For the 2009-2010 SSE, which is composed by two successive slip transients, fluids essentially migrate towards the plate interface (i.e., upward) in its horizontal segment, where must of NVTs and LFEs seem to take place. Since the maximum Darcy’s velocities for both events are of the order of meters per day (i.e., 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the migration speed of the LFE streaks), we concluded that the fluids diffusive transport is not responsible of the NVT and LFE migration during the SSEs. Instead, our results suggest that the strain field periodically induced by the slip transients act as a long-term pumping process that ultimately concentrates the fluids (and thus reduces the effective pressure) in the regions where the seismicity takes place as a consequence of small stress perturbations associated to the propagation of the aseismic slip.",

            "abstract": "A changing climate is manifested at ground level through the day to day weather. For all Northern residents – community, industrial, operational and response – the need to think about the weather is ever present. Northern residents, and in particular, indigenous community residents, fully understand implications of the weather, however, a comment that has been heard more often is that old ways of knowing are not as reliable as they once were. Weather patterns seem less consistent and subject to more rapid fluctuations. Compromised traditional ways of knowing puts those who need to travel or hunt at greater risk. One response to adapt to this emerging reality is to make greater use of western sources of information, such as weather data and charts provided by NOAA's National Weather Service or Environment Canada. The federal weather agencies have very large and complex forecasting regions to cover, and so one problem is that it can be difficult to provide perfectly tailored forecasts, that cover all possible problems, right down to the very local scale in the communities. Only those affected have a complete feel for their own concerns. Thus, key to a strategy to improve the utility of available weather information is a linking of local-scale manifestations of problematic weather to the larger-scale weather patterns. This is done in two ways: by direct consultation with Northern residents, and by installation of equipment to measure parameters of interest to residents, which are not already being measured.\nThis talk will overview projects in coastal Alaska and Canada targeting this objective. The challenge of designing and conducting interviews, and then of harvesting relevant information, will be visited using examples from the three major contexts: coastal community, industrial, and operational. Examples of how local comments can be married to weather products will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The global hydrological cycle intersects with human decision making at multiple scales, from dams and irrigation works to the taps in individuals’ homes. Residential water consumers are commonly encouraged to conserve; these messages are heard against a background of individual values and conceptions about water quality, uses, and availability. The degree to which these values impact the larger-hydrological dynamics, the way that changes in those values have impacts on the hydrological cycle through time, and the feedbacks by which water availability and quality in turn shape those values, are not well explored. To investigate this domain we employ a global-scale water balance model (WBM) coupled with a social-science-grounded agent-based model (ABM). The integration of a hydrological model with an agent-based model allows us to explore driving factors in the dynamics in coupled human-natural systems. From the perspective of the physical hydrologist, the ABM offers a richer means of incorporating the human decisions that drive the hydrological system; from the view of the social scientist, a physically-based hydrological model allows the decisions of the agents to play out against constraints faithful to the real world.\nWe apply the interconnected models to a study of Tucson, Arizona, USA, and its role in the larger Colorado River system. Our core concept is Technology-Induced Environmental Distancing (TIED), which posits that layers of technology can insulate consumers from direct knowledge of a resource. In Tucson, multiple infrastructure and institutional layers have arguably increased the conceptual distance between individuals and their water supply, offering a test case of the TIED framework.\nOur coupled simulation allows us to show how the larger system transforms a resource with high temporal and spatial variability into a consumer constant, and the effects of this transformation on the regional system. We use this to explore how pricing, messaging, and social dynamics impact demand, how changes in demand affect the regional water system, and under what system challenges the values of the individuals are likely to change. This study is a preamble to modeling multiple regionally connected cities and larger systems with impacts on hydrology at the continental and global scales.",

            "abstract": "Streams can be hotspots of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions resulting from microbial denitrification. Although the key role of streams in transforming reactive inorganic nitrogen is widely recognized, recent estimates of N2O emissions from aquatic ecosystems by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) may be largely underestimated in part due because current estimates do not capture mechanisms underlying inorganic nitrogen transformations along stream and river networks. Here, we demonstrate that stream hydro-morphology strongly influences N2O emissions, and we provide an integrative methodology for upscaling local biogeochemical processes to the catchment scale using a Damköhler number, which accounts for the complex interplay between stream hydro-morphology and biogeochemical characteristics of streambed sediments. Application of this theoretical framework to the large dataset collected as part of the 2nd Lotic Intersite Nitrogen eXperiment (LINXII) confirms that stream morphology is a major driver of N2O emissions from streams, and provides a foundation for scaling to rivers, which are in need of empirical testing.",

            "abstract": "Floods are one of the costliest natural disasters and the ability to understand their characteristics and their interactions with population, land cover and climate changes is of paramount importance. In order to accurately reproduce flood characteristics such as water inundation and heights both in the river channels and floodplains, hydrodynamic models are required. Most of these models operate at very high resolutions and are computationally very expensive, making their application over large areas very difficult. However, a need exists for such models to be applied at regional to global scales so that the effects of climate change with regards to flood risk can be examined. We use the LISFLOOD-FP hydrodynamic model to simulate a 40-year history of flood characteristics at the continental scale, particularly over Australia. LISFLOOD-FP is a 2-D hydrodynamic model that solves the approximate Saint-Venant equations at large scales (on the order of 1 km) using a sub-grid representation of the river channel. This implementation is part of an effort towards a global 1-km flood modeling framework that will allow the reconstruction of a long-term flood climatology. The components of this framework include a hydrologic model (the widely-used Variable Infiltration Capacity model) and a meteorological dataset that forces it. In order to extend the simulated flood climatology to 50-100 years in a consistent manner, reanalysis datasets have to be used. The objective of this study is the evaluation of multiple atmospheric reanalysis datasets (ERA, NCEP, MERRA, JRA) as inputs to the VIC/LISFLOOD-FP model. Comparisons of the simulated flood characteristics are made with both satellite observations of inundation and a benchmark simulation of LISFLOOD-FP being forced by observed flows. Finally, the implications of the availability of a global flood modeling framework for producing flood hazard maps and disseminating disaster information are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Forests play a significant role in the global climate system in large part through their uptake and storage of atmospheric carbon. Biomass inventories provide valuable constraints on annual to decadal changes in forest carbon stocks through periodic, repeated measurements. However, this information offers limited utility for attribution of the major drivers and process-level mechanisms that determine forest carbon dynamics. A better understanding of these mechanisms is needed to project future forest carbon cycle dynamics, which requires the use of process-based modeling for attribution of and sensitivity to the major drivers.\nHere we compare and analyze recent estimates of the carbon budget of the world's forests based on national-level resource inventories against a suite of process-based model simulations run with a common protocol for formal inter-comparison. Our analysis of the model simulation experiments from the Multi-scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP) suggests a large uncertainty in carbon cycle responses to these drivers, traceable primarily to the wide range in model structure relative to whether and how they represent the impacts of forest growth, management, disturbance and land use change. Although our study illustrates the benefits in retaining independence among the inventory and modeling estimates for comparison and benchmarking, progress toward a better understanding of the role of forests in the current and future global carbon cycle can also be made by more formally integrating these alternative but complementary scaling approaches.",

            "abstract": "Increases in atmospheric scatterers change the light environment at the surface both by decreasing total solar illumination and by converting direct radiation to diffuse radiation. In general, diffuse light is more efficient at driving photosynthesis than direct light, leading to disagreements in the net effect of changes in scattering on terrestrial photosynthesis, particularly in the context of large explosive volcanic eruptions. Standard analytical approaches for treating the trade-off between direct and diffuse radiation compare the changes in light against the fraction of light which is diffuse. Here we show that use of diffuse fraction as the independent variable in light trade-off calculations leads to results that are generally biased because the dependent variable (be it direct, diffuse or total radiation) functionally covaries with the independent variable, irrespective of the physical relationship between direct and diffuse radiation. This bias appears to dominate the results of published calculations. We develop a new method for quantifying the trade-off between direct and diffuse radiation on photosynthesis that is not subject to this artifact and demonstrate its use at four Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) sites.",

            "abstract": "We study the effect of interannual variability of the jetstream orientation on weather systems over the North Atlantic basin (NAB) using reanalysis data. The daily transient kinetic energy of the geostrophic wind (GTKE) is taken as a measure of the collective strength of the weather systems, i.e. of storm activity over the North Atlantic. We partition the NAB (85 W–0 W, 15 N–65 N) into four rectangular regions, divided by the 45 W meridian and the 40 N parallel, and calculate the winter (DJFM) average of GTKE for each quadrant at 400hPa. The spatial average of GTKE over each region shows prominent year-to-year variability that is strongly correlated with the NAO; the highest correlations occur in the eastern half of the NAB. The number of winter days when the average wind is faster than 30 m/s is 13–103 days in the NE quadrant and 0–2 days in the SE quadrant over the 1948–2012 period. The GTKE strength in the NE quadrant is a result of the orientation angle of the jetstream, with larger values when the jet is more zonal. To gain insight into the relation between the orientation angle and its downstream impact, we used a quasi-geostrophic, baroclinic model in a β-channel. The results show that an initially zonal jet persists at its initial latitude until the end of the integration, while a tilted jet propagates meridionally according to the Rossby wave group velocity, unless there is external forcing. We found an analytical steady-state solution to this problem with a forcing by a Gulf Stream–like narrow SST front. This front influences the atmospheric jet hundreds of kilometers further north, in the NW quadrant: it both strengthens the jet and tilts it northward at higher levels, as confirmed by thereanalysis data, while it weakens and turns the flow southward at lower levels. These results suggest that the interannual variability found in the angle of the jet stream and the GTKE are due to the interannual variability of the Gulf Stream’s SST front.",

However, to fully understand the observed RS patterns including plant growth related processes such as water and nutrient availability, knowledge of the vadose zone is necessary, which can be obtained by geophysical methods. We studied a 20 ha test site in Selhausen (Germany), where the upper terrace (UT) sediments consist of sand and gravel, whereas the lower terrace (LT) sediments consist of loamy silt. Leaf area index (LAI) maps that were derived from RapidEye satellite data taken after a drought period showed a high density of undulating structures of higher LAI values within the sand and gravel dominated (and generally lower LAI) UT. These structures were related to better crop performance originating from subsurface loamy silt paleo-river channels. Next, large-scale apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) data were obtained using a multi-configuration electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensor with depths of investigation (DOI) up to 1.8 m. The observed LAI patterns coincided well with the ECa patterns of the 1.8 m DOI measurements, and soil analysis confirmed the presence of silty soil in the deeper subsoil. To gain more knowledge, a novel EMI inversion scheme that inverts for a layered subsurface using multi-configuration EMI data was developed and applied to a one ha large field that contained both UT and LT sediments in the eastern and western part, respectively. The obtained smoothly changing lateral and vertical electrical conductivity model was confirmed by grain size distribution maps and two previously measured 120 m long electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) transects. Conclusively, the combined LAI and EMI analysis can be extended to relatively large areas up to the catchment scale to improve environmental models that aim at improved descriptions of plant growth, water, nutrient and energy processes.",

For the idealized case of a homogeneous water column above a moving but otherwise rigid bottom (in terms of assessing acoustic wave interaction), the description of the infinite family of acoustic modes is characterized by local water depth at source area; i.e. the period of the first acoustic mode is given by four times the required time for sound to travel from the seabed to the surface. Spreading off from earthquake zone, the dominant spectrum is filtered and enriched by seamounts and barriers. This study focuses on the characteristics of hydro-acoustic waves generated by sudden sea bottom motion in a weakly compressible fluid coupled with an underlying sedimentary layer, where the added complexity of the sediment layer rheology leads to both the lowering of dominant spectral peaks and wave attenuation across the full spectrum. To overcome the computational difficulties of three-dimensional models, we derive a depth integrated equation valid for varying water depth and sediment thickness. Damping behavior of the two layered system is initially taken into account by introducing the viscosity of fluid-like sedimentary layer. We show that low frequency pressure waves which are precursor components of tsunamis contain information of seafloor motion.",

            "abstract": "Researchers often create redundant methods for downloading, manipulating, and analyzing data from online resources. Moreover, the reproducibility of science can be hampered by complicated and voluminous data, lack of time for documentation and long-term maintenance of software, and fear of exposing programming skills. The combination of these factors can encourage unshared one-off programmatic solutions instead of openly provided reusable methods. Federal and academic researchers in the water resources and informatics domains have collaborated to address these issues. The result of this collaboration is a suite of modular R packages that can be used independently or as elements in reproducible analytical workflows. These documented and freely available R packages were designed to fill basic needs for the effective use of water data: the retrieval of time-series and spatial data from web resources (dataRetrieval, geoknife), performing quality assurance and quality control checks of these data with robust statistical methods (sensorQC), the creation of useful data derivatives (including physically- and biologically-relevant indices; GDopp, LakeMetabolizer), and the execution and evaluation of models (glmtools, rLakeAnalyzer). Here, we share details and recommendations for the collaborative coding process, and highlight the benefits of an open-source tool development pattern with a popular programming language in the water resources discipline (such as R). We provide examples of reproducible science driven by large volumes of web-available data using these tools, explore benefits of accessing packages as standardized web processing services (WPS) and present a working platform that allows domain experts to publish scientific algorithms in a service-oriented architecture (WPS4R). We assert that in the era of open data, tools that leverage these data should also be freely shared, transparent, and developed in an open innovation environment.",

This aims to enhance understanding of the basin-scale modelling process, and advance representation of the flux exchange between the land surface and atmosphere for fully coupled atmosphere-land surface scheme modeling. The study is conducted on the Saskatchewan River Basin (SaskRB), which is a GEWEX Regional Hydroclimate Project and part of the Changing Cold Regions Network (CCRN). We applied and tested MESH (Modélisation Environmentale Communautaire – Surface and Hydrology), which is a Canadian hydrological modelling system based on the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS), utilizing climate and assimilated remotely sensed data with ground-based observations.\n Targets of research are to 1) apply high resolution multiple climate forcing to enhance the representation of the alpine region; 2) refine the land surface modeling framework process representation through incorporating the annual and seasonal dynamic behavior of prairie pothole region streamflow contributing area; 3) implement the water storage and water abstraction dimension into the MESH modeling system to capture regulated catchments within the basin; 4) increase the parameter identifiability by introducing spatio-temporal multi-calibration of point and state variables against ground-based observation and remotely sensed data (for instance comparisons of modeled water storage change and soil moisture against GRACE and SMAP satellite products); 5) regionalize well-identified parameters to ungauged catchments assuming that the enhanced parameter identification reduces model uncertainty and the uncertainty that propagate in the process of parameter regionalization to ungauged catchments. The paper presents analysis of baseline model performance and strategic research needs, and reviews the scope for high resolution atmospheric models to improve representation of precipitation in the Canadian Rocky Mountain headwaters.",

Similar to sea spray aerosols formed through marine wave breaking, freshwater lakes generate lake spray aerosol (LSA). LSA can impact climate directly through scattering/absorption and indirectly through cloud nucleation. In addition, these LSA are suggested to impact human health through inhalation of these particles during algal bloom periods characterized by toxic cyanobacteria. Few studies have been conducted to assess the physical and chemical properties of freshwater LSA. Herein, we discuss constructing a LSA generation system and preliminary physical and chemical characterization of aerosol generated from water samples collected at various sites across Lake Erie, Lake Huron, Lake Superior, and Lake Michigan. Information on aerosol size distributions, number concentrations, and chemical composition will be discussed as a function of lake water blue-green algae concentration, dissolved organic carbon concentration, temperature, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen concentration.

            "abstract": "Main Belt Comets (MBCs), or Active Asteroids, constitute a newly identified class of solar system objects. They have stable, asteroid-like orbits and some exhibit a recurrent comet-like appearance. It is believed that they survived the age of the solar system in a dormant state and that their current ice sublimation driven activity only began recently. Buried water ice is the only volatile expected to survive under an insulating surface. Excavation by an impact can expose the ice and trigger the start of MBC activity. We present the case for a mission to one of these objects, to be submitted to the European Space Agency’s current call for an M-class mission. The specific science goals of the Castalia mission are: 1. Characterize a new Solar System family, the MBCs, by in-situ investigation 2. Understand the physics of activity on MBCs 3. Directly sample water in the asteroid belt and test if MBCs are a viable source for Earth's water 4. Use the observed structure of an MBC as a tracer of planetary system formation and evolution. These goals can be achieved by a spacecraft designed to rendezvous with and orbit an MBC for a time interval of some months, arriving before the active period for mapping and then sampling the gas and dust released during the active phase. Given the low level of activity of MBCs, and the expectation that their activity comes from only a localized patch on the surface, the orbiting spacecraft will have to be able to maintain a very close orbit over extended periods - the Castalia plan envisages an orbiter capable of 'hovering' autonomously at distances of only a few km from the surface of the MBC. The strawman payload comprises a Visible and near-infrared spectral imager, Thermal infrared imager, Radio science, Subsurface radar, Dust impact detector, Dust composition analyser, Neutral/ion mass spectrometer, Magnetometer, and Plasma package. In addition to this, a surface science package is being considered. At the moment, MBC 133P/Elst-Pizarro is the best-known target for such a mission. A design study for the Castalia mission has been carried out in partnership between the science team, DLR and OHB Systems. This study looked at possible missions to 133P with launch dates around 2025, and found that this, and backup MBC targets, are reachable by an ESA M-class mission.

The spatial scales of interest range from a hundred to a few thousand kilometers horizontally (synoptic large scale structuring) and meters to kilometers (small scale structuring that cause scintillations). RF space weather applications affected by electron density variability on these scales include navigation, communication and geo-location of RF frequencies ranging from 100’s of Hz to GHz. For many of these applications, the necessary forecast time periods range from nowcasts to 1-3 hours. For more “mission planning” applications, necessary forecast times can range from hours to days.\nIn this paper we present a new ionosphere-thermosphere (IT) specification and forecast model being developed at JHU/APL based upon the well-known data assimilation algorithms Ionospheric Data Assimilation Four Dimensional (IDA4D) and Estimating Model Parameters from Ionospheric Reverse Engineering (EMPIRE). This new forecast model, “Forward Update Simple IONosphere model Plus IDA4D Plus EMPIRE (FUSION++), ingests data from observations related to electron density, winds, electric fields and neutral composition and provides improved specification and forecast of electron density. In addition, the new model provides improved specification of winds, electric fields and composition.\nWe will present a short overview and derivation of the methodology behind FUSION++, some preliminary results using real observational sources, example derived RF application products such as HF bi-static propagation, and initial comparisons with independent data sources for validation.",

            "abstract": "Methods are needed to understand and predict streamflows in systems undergoing anthropogenic and climatic alteration. This study is motivated by a need to develop methods to accurately estimate historical and future flow regimes of the Delaware River to inform management decisions for the endangered dwarf wedgemussel (Alasmidonta heterodon). Many streamflow regimes in this system have undergone substantial alteration within the past 100 years. Here, flow duration curves (FDCs), a common hydrologic tool used to assess flow regimes, are created and examined at 145 Delaware River Basin catchments. These catchments have experienced various hydrologic alterations, including land use changes, water withdrawals, and river regulation due to dams and reservoirs. Linear regression models are developed for various percentile flows across a FDC. These models use watershed characteristics that describe observed flow regimes in altered as well as unaltered systems. The characteristics that have the most significant influence on the shape of the FDCs are then identified and isolated as descriptors of the alteration. Once these models are developed to include these key variables, given a specific alteration (e.g. fresh water withdrawals, change in annual precipitation, etc.), a new flow regime can be estimated. Preliminary results indicate that certain watershed characteristics related to alteration (e.g. magnitude of land fragmentation, water withdrawals, hydrologic disturbance index) are significant in our models and influence FDC patterns. The results of this study may prove to have broader applications in regards to water resources management as the methods developed here may serve as a predictive tool as human interference and climatic changes continue to alter flow regimes.",

In our unique model, we catalyze actionable science on pressing environmental issues such as climate change, and undertake comprehensive stakeholder engagement, public communication, and policy outreach. Built on more than 10 years of experience creating programs at the interface of science and policy at Hubbard Brook, Harvard Forest, and other LTER sites, we apply science communication research to practice in various ways depending on the context and problem being addressed.\nIn keeping with the research on co-production and the importance of establishing credibility, salience, and legitimacy, we engage stakeholders from the outset of each project. Stakeholders and scientists collaborate to define the scope of the project, frame questions relevant to society, and define communication products to meet their needs. To promote broader distribution and uptake, we combine message development, storytelling, and media training to craft and deliver relatable stories that tap into news values and human values. Three recent SPE successes include: (1) Wildlands and Woodlands: A regional forest conservation report released in 2010 that generated 137 media stories and influenced land conservation policy, (2) Changes to the Land: A suite of communication products developed in 2013 for a landscape scenarios project in Massachusetts that saturated the state’s media markets and have been widely cited by policymakers, and (3) Co-benefits of Carbon Standards: A national air quality report released in 2014 that was cited in 76 media stories and helped reframe the national debate on carbon dioxide emissions standards in terms of their potential local health and environmental benefits.\nWe will describe our successful applications of science communication research and discuss several critical disconnections between research and practice. These include, how much and what form of stakeholder engagement is most appropriate for a given project? How does the state of the science and the current policy context shape the pathways to impact and associated communication strategies? What can we learn from advocacy campaign to make our science communication sustained and more effective?",

            "abstract": "The advent of large area satellite coverage in the visible spectrum enabled satellite-based tracking of ice sheet flow just over twenty years ago. Following this, rapid development of techniques for imaging radar data enabled the wide-area mapping and time series coverage that SAR has brought to the documentation of changing ice discharge. We report on the maturation of feature tracking in visible-band satellite imagery of the ice sheets enabled by the high radiometric resolution and accurate geolocation delivered by Landsat 8, and apply this to mapping ice flow in the interiors of Antarctica and Greenland. The high radiometric resolution of Landsat 8 enables one to track subtle patterns on the surface of the ice sheet, unique at spatial scales of a few hundred meters, between images separated by multiple orbit cycles. In areas with significant dynamic topography generated by ice flow, this requires use of simple spatial filtering techniques first applied by Scambos et al. 1992. The result is densely sampled maps of surface motion that begin to rival the coverage available from SAR speckle tracking and interferometry. Displacement accuracy can approach one tenth of a pixel for reasonable chip sizes using conventional normalized cross-correlation; this can exceed the geolocation accuracy of the scenes involved, but coverage is sufficient to allow correction strategies based on very slow moving ice. The advance in radiometry, geo-location, and tracking tools is augmented by an increased rate of acquisition by Landsat 8. This helps mitigate the issue of cloud cover, as much of every 16-day orbit cycle over ice is acquired, maximizing the acquisition of clear-sky scenes. Using the correlation techniques common to IMCORR and later software, modern libraries, and single-cpu hardware, we are able to process full Landsat 8 scene pairs in a few minutes, allowing comprehensive analysis of ~1K available ice sheet image pairs in a few days.",

            "abstract": "Measurement of an organism’s temperature is of basic physiological importance and therefore necessary for ecosystem modeling, yet most models derive leaf temperature from energy balance arguments or assume it is equal to air temperature. This is because continuous, direct measurement of leaf temperature outside of a controlled environment is difficult and rarely done. Of even greater challenge is measuring leaf temperature with the resolution required to understand the underlying energy balance and regulation of plant processes.\nTo measure leaf temperature through the year, we have mounted a high-resolution, thermal infrared camera overlooking the canopy of a temperate deciduous forest. The camera is co-located with an eddy covariance system and a suite of radiometric sensors. Our camera measures longwave thermal infrared (λ = 7.5–14 microns) using a microbolometer array. Suspended in the canopy within the camera FOV is a matte black copper plate instrumented with fine wire thermocouples that acts as a thermal reference for each image.\nIn this presentation, I will discuss the challenges of continuous, long-term field operation of the camera, as well as measurement sensitivity to physical and environmental parameters. Based on this analysis, I will show that the uncertainties in converting radiometric signal to leaf temperature are well constrained. The key parameter for minimizing uncertainty is the emissivity of the objects being imaged: measuring the emissivity to within 0.01 enables leaf temperature to be calculated to within 0.5°C.\nFinally, I will present differences in leaf temperature observed amongst species. From our two-year record, we characterize high frequency, daily, and seasonal thermal signatures of leaves and crowns, in relation to environmental conditions. Our images are taken with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to quantify the preferential heating of sunlit portions of the canopy and the cooling effect of wind gusts.\nFuture work will be focused on correlations between hyperspectral vegetation indices, fluxes, and thermal signatures to characterize vegetation stress. As water stress increases, causing photosynthesis and transpiration to shutdown, heat fluxes, leaf temperature, and narrow band vegetation indices should report signatures of the affected processes.",

            "abstract": "The atmospheric limb sounding technique making use of radio signals transmitted by the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites has emerged as a powerful and relatively inexpensive all weather global observing system. As demonstrated by the proof-of-concept GPS Meteorology (GPS/MET) experiment in 1995 and more recently by the CHAMP and SAC-C missions, the GPS radio occultation (RO) sounding data are shown to be of high accuracy and high vertical resolution. The GPS RO data provided by the joint U.S.-Taiwan COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3 mission, a constellation of six microsatellites launched in 2006, have been shown to be extremely valuable for global numerical weather prediction, and the study of weather and climate processes. In particular, the temperature and moisture profiles derived from the GPS RO soundings have been found to be useful in revealing the salient vertical structure of the MJO. Stimulated by the success of the COSMIC mission, U.S. and Taiwan are developing a follow-on mission, known as COSMIC-2, which consists of a constellation of 12 satellites. The first tropical constellation of six satellites will be launched in May 2016 and the second polar constellation of another six satellites will be launched in 2019. COSMIC-2 will make use of an advanced receiver, and will track the Russian GLONASS system in addition to GPS. With the production of ~10,000 high quality radio occultation soundings per day, COSMIC-2 will be extremely valuable for the study of atmospheric processes over the maritime continent. In this presentation, we will discuss the applications of COSMIC-2 RO data to the study of MJO, and the support for the field campaign of the Year of Maritime Continent.",

            "abstract": "Pure magnetite experiences a first order phase transition, called the Verwey transition, at ~120K whereby the mineral's crystal structure changes from cubic to monoclinic. This transformation has a profound effect on the magnetic properties of magnetite. Internal and external stresses have been shown to affect the onset of the Verwey transition, but the processes by which this occurs have not been observed. To further investigate this behavior, we used transmission electron microscopy on deformed magnetite samples to simultaneously image dislocations, magnetic domain walls, and low-temperature twins while cooling through the Verwey transition. To relate the observed changes to more readily-measurable bulk sample magnetic behavior, we made low-temperature magnetic measurements using SQUID magnetometry. According to these low temperature measurements, the temperature of the phase transition is depressed by as much as 6°C in the deformed samples. Combining these two techniques allows us, for the first time, to observe the Verwey transition in a defect-rich area and to observe the manner in which dislocations, and their associated stress fields, influence and impede the growth of twin structures as magnetite is cooled through the Verwey transition.",

            "abstract": "During collisionless reconnection, the decoupling of the field from the plasma is known to occur only within the localized ion and electron diffusion regions, however predictions from fully kinetic simulations do not agree with experimental observations on the size of the electron diffusion region, implying differing reconnection mechanisms. Previous experiments, along with 2D and 3D simulations, have conclusively shown that this discrepancy cannot be explained by either classical collisions or Lower-Hybrid Drift Instability (Roytershtyn 2010, 2013). Due to computational limitations, however, previous simulations were constrained to have minimal scale separation between the electron skin depth and the Debye length (de/λD ~ 10), much smaller than in experiments (de/λD ~ 300). This lack of scale-separation can drastically modify the electrostatic microphysics within the diffusion layer. Using 3D, fully explicit kinetic simulations with a realistic and unprecedentedly large separation between the Debye length and the electron skin depth, de/λD = 64, we show that high frequency electrostatic waves (ω >> ωLH) can exist within the electron diffusion region. These waves generate small-scale turbulence within the electron diffusion region which acts to broaden the layer. Anomalous resistivity is also generated by the turbulence and significantly modifies the force balance. In addition to simulation results, initial experimental measurements of high frequency fluctuations (electrostatic and electromagnetic, f ≤ 1 GHz) in the Magnetic Reconnection Experiment (MRX) will be presented.",

An example of this synergy is present in his work where optical and radar techniques were reconciled in order to obtain the O+ temperature variability for 2008 and 2009. During this period, a historical deep solar minimum condition was registered with a remarkable absence of sunspots for a long period (translated into a decreasing in the EUV-UV irradiance). This particular feature implies in an important tool to investigate the variability of O+ temperature, once that any variation can be related to season (modulated by the neutral atmosphere) and/or another modulator different than solar energy input. The OII 7320 Å twilight airglow data used in this work were obtained during new moon periods using a high-spectral resolution Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) with CCD array detection. The FPI was configured with 0.9 cm plate spacing, which produced a free spectral range of 0.298Å and a spectral resolution of 0.03Å, sufficient to sample line width temperatures as low as 500K. A very narrow 3Å Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) three-cavity interference filter was also used.",

            "abstract": "Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and the production and emission of methane from sediments in inland waters and shallow oceans both contributes to and may be exacerbated by climate change. In some of these shallow-water settings, methane fluxes are often controlled by episodic free-gas venting. The fraction of the methane released from the sediments that bypasses dissolution in the water column and reaches the atmosphere impacts the magnitude of the climate forcing, and this fraction depends critically on the mode and spatiotemporal characteristics of the bubble releases. The spacing and persistence of the gas vents may be determined by the heterogeneity of the methane source, but within regions of uniform methanogenesis they arise from the competition between mechanisms driving lateral and vertical transport of methane in the sediments. Here, we present measurements of the spacing, persistence and variability in intensity of methane vents within a wide area of lake sediments (~400 m2) and over a multi-month period. The measurements were made using a fixed-location Imagenex DeltaT 837B multibeam sonar, which was calibrated to quantify gas fluxes with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution (~0.5 m, 6 Hz). Drops in hydrostatic pressure were a characteristic trigger for the sonar-detected ebullition events, and the episodicity of the fluxes is reproduced with a mechanistic numerical model of methane venting through dynamic conduits that dilate in response to hydrostatic unloading. The spatial characteristics of the sonar-detected vents inform conceptual and mathematical models of methane transport and release from deformable sediments, as well as the uncertainty associated with upscaling. Taken together, these results point towards a better understanding of the microscale processes controlling methane venting from deformable sediments, as well as their impact on large-scale methane fluxes from shallow-water bodies. Figure: Top: time series of daily sonar-estimated gas fluxes over the entire observation area (black bars and circles) from March 1 - May 18, 2014, compared with a mechanistic, numerical model (orange) that is driven by fluctuations in hydrostatic pressure (blue, rescaled to fit).

In addition, anthropogenic emissions are significant in the Southeast and photochemistry is rapid. The NOAA SENEX aircraft campaign took place in June-July 2013 in the southeast U.S. as part of the Southeast Atmosphere Study (SAS) and was focused on studying the interactions between these emissions to form secondary pollutants. The NOAA WP-3 aircraft conducted 20 research flights between May 27 and July 10, 2013 based out of Smyrna, TN.\nIn this presentation we focus on the emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Various methods to determine emissions of isoprene and monoterpenes are investigated, e.g.: (1) emissions are determined by looking at the ambient mixing ratio, their lifetime and mixing volume, (2) eddy covariance or wavelet flux measurement techniques are tested, and (3) using the NCAR C-130 observations of isoprene fluxes, the correlations between fluxes and concentrations and variability to estimate fluxes from the P-3 data. The resulting emission flux estimates are compared with biogenic emission inventories.\nThe forested Southeast US is heavily managed for large-scale wood and wood products production and therefore has a large density of pulp and paper mills, which are a source of monoterpenes and other VOCs that are typically thought to be biogenic. The significance of VOC emissions from point sources such as the paper mills and others are investigated.",

            "abstract": "Water utilities, reeling from increased impacts of successive extreme events such as floods, droughts, and derechos, are taking a more proactive role in preparing for future incursions. A recent study by Federal and water foundation investigators, reveals how six US water utilities and their regions prepared for, responded to, and coped with recent extreme weather and climate events and the lessons they are using to plan future adaptation and resilience activities.\nTwo case studies will be highlighted. (1) Sonoma County, CA, has had alternating floods and severe droughts. In 2009, this area, home to competing water users, namely, agricultural crops, wineries, tourism, and fisheries faced a three-year drought, accompanied at the end by intense frosts. Competing uses of water threatened the grape harvest, endangered the fish industry and resulted in a series of regulations, and court cases. Five years later, new efforts by partners in the entire watershed have identified mutual opportunities for increased basin sustainability in the face of a changing climate. (2) Washington DC had a derecho in late June 2012, which curtailed water, communications, and power delivery during a record heat spell that impacted hundreds of thousands of residents and lasted over the height of the tourist-intensive July 4th holiday. Lessons from this event were applied three months later in anticipation of an approaching Superstorm Sandy.\nThis study will help other communities in improving their resiliency in the face of future climate extremes. For example, this study revealed that (1) communities are planning with multiple types and occurrences of extreme events which are becoming more severe and frequent and are impacting communities that are expanding into more vulnerable areas and (2) decisions by one sector can not be made in a vacuum and require the scientific, sectoral and citizen communities to work towards sustainable solutions.",

            "abstract": "The complex hydrodynamics of river confluences have been the focus of numerous investigations over the past several decades. Confluences are locations in river systems characterized by complex patterns of turbulent flow structure, especially within the mixing interface that develops between the two flows. To date, most field investigations of flow structure at stream confluences have been based on point measurements of velocity time series (e.g using ADVs) or on time-averaged data with high spatial resolution, but poor temporal resolution (e.g. using ADCPs). Past approaches have failed to capture the spatial and temporal density of velocity measurements needed to adequately characterize complex turbulent flow structures. In contrast, Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) has been used successfully in laboratory studies to define in considerable detail the characteristics of turbulent structures. This study uses field-based PIV to characterize surficial flow structure within a small stream confluence. Landscape mulch served as seeding material for the PIV. Particle motion was recorded at a high frame rate using a small action camera mounted above the surface of the flow. Near-surface 3D velocities of flow were measured with an acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) to evaluate velocity data generated by the PIV analysis. Results show that field-based PIV captures nicely complex patterns of fluid motion at the surface of the flow, revealing the two-dimensional characteristics of coherent flow structures. Velocities resulting from the PIV analysis match measured velocities most closely where the flow is least complex and where seeding material remains uniformly distributed throughout the flow. Overall the method appears promising for qualitatively assessing flow structure and for quantifying the size, duration, and vorticity of turbulent structures. Field-based PIV is a valuable technique that can be used along with traditional velocity measurements to more completely and effectively characterize complex turbulent flows in river environments.",

            "abstract": "To determine current regional stress field and to characterize the resultant crustal deformation in SE Korea, Quaternary fault, focal mechanism, and geotechnical in-situ stress data were synthetically analyzed. The Quaternary faults are extensively observed along major inherited fault zones and show compatible orientations with general trends of the inherited faults. Most of the Quaternary faults have a top-to-the-west thrust geometry and kinematics and show a tendency of upward-decreasing dip angle and upward-narrowing gouge zone. Slip-sense indicators and paleo-stress field reconstructions indicate that the faults resulted from reverse or transpressional faulting under an E-W compression. All the magnetic fabrics (AMS) of the fault gouges also indicate the prevailing reverse-slip faulting under an ENE-WNW compression. The dominant oblate magnetic fabrics parallel to fault plane and the degrees of anisotropy increasing in proportion to their oblatenesses indicate that the fabrics have formed by a progressive deformation due to continuous simple shear during the last reactivation stage as reverse faulting. The focal mechanism study in and around the Korean Peninsula show the horizontally clustered P-axes in ENE-WSW direction and the girdle-distributed T-axes in NNW trend. The geotechnical in-situ stress data in south Korea also show NE- or ENE-trending maximum horizontal stress. The current crustal deformation in Korea thus can be characterized by contractional structures produced under a regional E-W or ENE-WSW compression stress field, and most of the Quaternary faults resulted from the local re-activation of appropriately oriented inherited major faults. Considering the tectonic setting and structural features in Asia during the Neogene, the current stress regime is interpreted to have been caused by the cooperation of westward shallow subduction of Pacific Plate and collision of Indian and Eurasian continents since about 5-3.5 Ma.",

            "abstract": "The 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster required unprecedented engagement and collaboration with scientists from multiple disciplines across government, academia, and industry. Although this spurred the rapid advancement of valuable new scientific knowledge and tools, it also exposed weaknesses in the system of information dissemination and exchange among the scientists from those three sectors. Limited government communication with the broader scientific community complicated the rapid mobilization of the scientific community to assist with spill response, evaluation of impact, and public perceptions of the crisis. The lessons and new laws produced from prior spills such as Exxon Valdez were helpful, but ultimately did not lead to the actions necessary to prepare a suitable infrastructure that would support collaboration with non-governmental scientists. As oil demand pushes drilling into increasingly extreme environments, addressing the challenge of effective, science-based disaster response is an imperative.\nOur study employs a user-centered design process to 1) understand the obstacles to and opportunity spaces for effective scientific collaboration during environmental crises such as large oil spills, 2) identify possible tools and strategies to enable rapid information exchange between government responders and non-governmental scientists from multiple relevant disciplines, and 3) build a network of key influencers to secure sufficient buy-in for scaled implementation of appropriate tools and strategies. Our methods include user ethnography, complex system mapping, individual and system behavioral analysis, and large-scale system design to identify and prototype a solution to this crisis collaboration challenge.\nIn this talk, we will present out insights gleaned from existing analogs of successful scientific collaboration during crises and our initial findings from the 60 targeted interviews we conducted that highlight key collaboration challenges that government agencies, academic research institutions, and industry scientists face during oil spill crises. We will also present a synthesis of leverage points in the system that may amplify the impact of an improved collaboration strategy among scientific stakeholders.",

            "abstract": "The period between 1780-1600 Ma was one of extensive crustal growth in southern Laurentia. After this period, certain areas of southwestern Laurentia, such as western Arizona, are conventionally thought to have been tectonically stable and to have remained at mid-crustal depths until 1400 Ma or even later. However, a pre-1700 Ma period of isothermal decompression has been documented in the southern Hualapai Mountains suggesting that western Arizona underwent a tectonically active period of exhumation between 1740-1700 Ma. Furthermore, geologic mapping and petrographic analysis show that two sequences of metasedimentary rocks in the central Hualapai Mountains and the Cottonwood Cliffs have experienced different grades of metamorphism (granulite-facies vs. amphibolite/greenschist-facies). These observations imply that the first sequence was deposited, buried, deformed, and metamorphosed at granulite-facies conditions during a 1740-1720 Ma event. Then, the rocks were exhumed, and the second sequence was deposited. Subsequently both sequences were buried, deformed, and metamorphosed at amphibolite/greenschist-facies conditions during the ca. 1700 Ma Yavapai orogeny. The preliminary results will be further tested in both locations by determining U-Pb ages of detrital zircons in quartzites of both sequences and by analyzing the pressure-temperature conditions of metamorphism of both sequences using two techniques: the garnet-biotite thermometer and GASP geobarometer and isochemical plots. The tectonic exhumation hypothesis is supported if the youngest zircons in the amphibolite/greenschist-facies (younger?) sequence are younger than the youngest zircons of the granulite-facies (older?) sequence and if the amphibolite/greenschist-facies sequence does yield lower pressure-temperature conditions than the granulite-facies sequence. If the results support the exhumation hypothesis, the history of southwestern Laurentia is more complex and dynamic than previously thought.",

            "abstract": "The geological record contains a rich archive of the exported remains of plankton skeletons that can inform our predictions of their response to current and near-future environmental change. However, these fossilised remains represent integrated populations of millions of individuals recording reproductive success over daily timescales, with each cell responding to its own microenvironment. How then do whole species and communities show ‘response’ to changes in climate occurring on timescales far longer than that of the individual? And what exactly does ‘response’ mean in this context? Here, we utilize remarkably well-preserved assemblages of calcareous nannoplankton in order to interrogate fossil populations uniquely at an individual cellular-level, exploring the link between individuals and the success of the species, thereby tackling these questions from the bottom up. By studying individual fossilized cells we can draw direct comparisons with modern coccolithophore cells and as such we have combined observations from living coccolithophore cultures, naturally occurring populations in the ocean and exquisitely preserved fossil records. The fossils provide us with case studies of community variability alongside environmental change, over both long timescales of greenhouse to icehouse climate states and also more abrupt events such as the Paleogene hyperthermals. Finding these exquisitely preserved fossils is challenging, but there are exceptional situations where preservation bias is greatly reduced and we find complete coccospheres and therefore the intact biomineralised coverings of long-dead cells. These coccospheres preserve invaluable information about the original living cell including its size, levels of particulate organic carbon a\nnd inorganic carbon, ontogeny, and growth phase – information that tells us about their reproductive success and their potential role in local biogeochemical cycling. By better understanding these individual cells, we can start to think about the cumulative outcome of seasonal reproductive cycles that results in what we traditionally view as species-level ‘responses’.",

            "abstract": "The magnitude of carbon fluxes through arid and semi-arid ecosystems is considered modest, but integrated over the ~40% of the global land surface covered by these ecosystems, the total carbon stored is almost twice that in temperate forest ecosystems. In the semi-arid Southwestern U.S., drought and rising temperatures have triggered insect outbreaks, fire and widespread mortality in the past 5 years, all of which are predicted to increase in the next century. Understanding how resilient carbon pools and fluxes in these biomes are to these disturbances constitutes a large uncertainty in our ability to understand both carbon and energy flux dynamics in this region. We use an 8 year record (2007-2014) of continuous measurements of net ecosystem exchange of carbon (NEE) and its components (gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Re), and evapotranspiration (ET) made over the New Mexico Elevation Gradient (NMEG) network of flux tower sites (desert grassland, creosote shrubland, juniper savanna, piñon-juniper woodland, ponderosa pine and subalpine mixed conifer) to quantify the biome-specific responses of carbon and water dynamics to these disturbances. In particular, we focus on biome-specific responses across the NMEG biomes to the extended drought in this region from 2011-2014, and to the widespread mortality observed in piñon-juniper woodlands following the turn of the century drought (1999-2002) and multi-year recent drought. Finally, we compare functional responses of land-surface fluxes to recent catastrophic fires (grassland, subalpine conifer biomes), and insect outbreaks (subalpine conifer and piñon-juniper woodland biomes). We discuss the results in terms of which disturbances have contributed to and are likely to trigger the largest changes in carbon sequestration in this region in response to predicted climate change scenarios.",

            "abstract": "The southwestern U.S. experienced an extended drought from 1999-2002 which led to widespread coniferous tree mortality throughout New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Colorado. Piñon-juniper (PJ) woodlands were extremely vulnerable to this drought, experiencing 40 to 95% mortality of piñon pine (Pinus edulis) and 2-25% mortality of juniper (Juniperus monosperma) in less than 3 years. Understanding the response trajectories of these woodlands is crucial given that climate projections for the region suggest that episodic droughts, and associated conifer mortality, are likely to increase in frequency and severity in the coming century. We used a combination of eddy covariance, high-resolution remotely sensed datasets, and sap flow made at an undisturbed PJ woodland (control) in central New Mexico and at a manipulation site within 2 miles of the control where all piñon trees greater than 7 cm dbh were girdled (decreasing LAI by ~ 1/3) to quantify the response of ecosystem carbon, water and energy fluxes in PJ woodlands to piñon mortality.\nThe girdled site has gradually become both warmer and drier following piñon mortality (annual average temperatures have been 0.6 – 1.2 C warmer than the control site over past 5 years). Our analyses suggest the mortality-triggered decrease in aerodynamic conductance is largely responsible for the increase in surface temperature. In addition, both carbon and water cycling in the girdled site have been more sensitive than the control site to the extreme drought experienced from 2011-2013. We compare these results from our manipulation experiment to: 1) observations in PJ control site and surrounding area following 2013 die-off triggered by bark beetles, 2) responses of MODIS land surface temperature and leaf area index in NM PJ woodlands to climatic variables before and after mortality, and 3) output from CLM4 run in point mode for PJ woodlands where we modified percent vegetation/bare ground cover and quantified the model sensitivity of land surface temperature and energy balance to this induced mortality. We discuss the results in terms of feedbacks triggered by these significant mortality events on the climate system.",

            "abstract": "Alfvén waves, a fundamental mode of magnetized plasmas, are ubiquitous in space plasmas. For example, a cascade of non-linearly interacting Alfvén waves is believed to play a key role in solar wind turbulence. At perpendicular length scales below the ion gyroradius, this takes the form of Kinetic Alfvén Waves (KAWs). Theoretical predictions show that these Alfvén waves may be unstable to various decay instabilities (e.g. [1,2]). In particular, theory predicts that a KAW may decay into two daughter KAWs even at very low amplitude (δB/B<10-3). Given the turbulent nature of solar wind observations and limited data-points, laboratory experiments may play a vital role in exploring the key physics responsible.\nThe present work, conducted at UCLA's Large Plasma Device (LAPD) represents the first fundamental laboratory study of the non-linear Alfvén wave interactions responsible for Alfvén wave decay instabilities. These experiments include the first laboratory observation of the Alfvén-acoustic mode coupling at the heart of the Parametric Decay Instability [3]. More recently, laboratory efforts have focused on the predicted non-linear decay of one KAW into two daughter KAWs. In these experiments, a single high-frequency ω/Ωi~0.7 Alfvén wave is launched, resulting in two daughter modes with frequencies and wave numbers that suggest co-propagating KAWs produced by decay of the pump wave. The observed process is parametric in nature, with the frequency of the daughter modes varying as a function of pump mode amplitude.

            "abstract": "The NCAR Research Data Archive (RDA; http://rda.ucar.edu) contains a large and diverse collection of meteorological and oceanographic observations, operational and reanalysis outputs, and remote sensing datasets to support atmospheric and geoscience research. The RDA contains greater than 600 dataset collections which support the varying needs of a diverse user community. The number of RDA users is increasing annually, and the most popular method used to access the RDA data holdings is through web based protocols, such as wget and cURL based scripts. In the year 2013, 10,000 unique users downloaded greater than 820 terabytes of data from the RDA, and customized data products were prepared for more than 29,000 user-driven requests.\nIn order to further support this increase in web download usage, the RDA is implementing the Globus data transfer service (www.globus.org) to provide a GridFTP data transfer option for the user community. The Globus service is broadly scalable, has an easy to install client, is sustainably supported, and provides a robust, efficient, and reliable data transfer option for RDA users. This paper highlights the main functionality and usefulness of the Globus data transfer service for accessing the RDA holdings.\nThe Globus data transfer service, developed and supported by the Computation Institute at The University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory, uses the GridFTP as a fast, secure, and reliable method for transferring data between two endpoints. A Globus user account is required to use this service, and data transfer endpoints are defined on the Globus web interface. In the RDA use cases, the access endpoint is created on the RDA data server at NCAR. The data user defines the receiving endpoint for the data transfer, which can be the main file system at a host institution, a personal work station, or laptop. Once initiated, the data transfer runs as an unattended background process by Globus, and Globus ensures that the transfer is accurately fulfilled. Users can monitor the data transfer progress on the Globus web interface and optionally receive an email notification once it is complete. Globus also provides a command-line interface to support scripted transfers, which can be useful when embedded in data processing workflows.",

            "abstract": "In the night of June 12, 1962 three inmates used a raft made of raincoats\nto escaped the ultimate maximum security prison island Alcatraz in San\nFrancisco, United States. History is unclear about what happened to\nthe escapees. At what time did they step into the water, did they\nsurvive, if so, where did they reach land?\nThe fate of the escapees has been the subject of much debate: did they\nmake landfall on Angel Island, or did the current sweep them out of\nthe bay and into the cold pacific ocean?\nIn this presentation, we try to shed light on this historic case using a\nvisualization of a high-resolution hydrodynamic simulation of the San Francisco Bay, combined with historical tidal records. By reconstructing the hydrodynamic conditions and using a particle based simulation of the escapees we show possible scenarios. The interactive model is visualized using both a 3D photorealistic and web based visualization.\nThe \"Escape from Alcatraz\" scenario demonstrates the capabilities of the 3Di platform. This platform is normally used for overland flooding (1D/2D). The model engine uses a quad tree structure, resulting in an order of magnitude speedup. The subgrid approach takes detailed bathymetry information into account. The inter-model variability is tested by comparing the results with the DFlow Flexible Mesh (DFlowFM) San Francisco Bay model.\nInteractivity is implemented by converting the models from static programs to interactive libraries, adhering to the Basic Model\nInterface (BMI). Interactive models are more suitable for answering\nexploratory research questions such as this reconstruction effort.\nAlthough these hydrodynamic simulations only provide circumstantial\nevidence for solving the mystery of what happened during the foggy dark\nnight of June 12, 1962, it can be used as a guidance and provides an\ninteresting testcase to apply interactive modelling.",

            "abstract": "Human activities are driving climatic warming and more frequent extreme weather, persistent throughout the recent warming hiatus. The effects of these changes on vegetation phenology remains poorly understood. Forest phenology studies typically focus on the length of the growing season and related changes in carbon uptake. Changes to tree regeneration remain uncertain, yet carry multiple climate feedback pathways. Dominant tree species drive forest biogeochemistry, with species varying in nutrient cycling, soil biota, biogenic volatile organic compound emissions, and productivity under drought, while drought conditions are likely to increase in severity. Regeneration processes underlie forest dynamics, the largest source of biosphere model uncertainty.\nWe applied a process-based tree germination and establishment model to a study area in western Canada in order to estimate the effects of 20th and 21stcentury climatic change on regeneration in northern forests. We parameterized the model for 21 major tree species using biophysical parameters derived from the literature. We classified daily weather station and soils data for fourteen biogeoclimatic regions within the study area for three historical 30-year periods and the most recent decade: 1923-1952, 1953-1982, 1983-2012, and 2003-2012. We simulated the effects of changing temperature and precipitation conditions on germination and establishment processes for 21 tree species, fourteen regions, and four time periods.\nWe found that regeneration conditions diminished across the 1923 to 2012 period, driven by soil water limitations. While regeneration conditions improved during the recent warming hiatus, a downward trend persists at a multi-decadal scale. In contrast to studies indicating regenerational improvements in higher latitudes and elevations, with disequilibrium in lowland forests due to a higher velocity of climatic change, we found that a soil water balance shift drove species downhill, supporting a recent study. As the climate continues to warm, we anticipate that changes to disturbance regimes will unlock the lagged regenerational response of northern forests currently in climatic disequilibrium, producing a complex network of climatic feedbacks.",

The CRISM retrievals show the seasonally and globally averaged carbon monoxide mixing ratio to be near 800 ppm, but with strong seasonal variations, especially at high latitudes. At low latitudes, the carbon monoxide mixing ratio varies in response to the mean seasonal cycle of surface pressure and shows little variation with topography. At high latitudes, carbon monoxide is depleted in the summer hemisphere by a factor of two or more, while in the winter hemisphere there is relatively higher mixing ratio in regions with low-lying topography.",

            "abstract": "The solar wind magnetic turbulence in the inertial and kinetic range has been well studied using Fourier and Wavelet transform. Spectra in this range are usually described as a succession of two spectral slopes separated by a spectral break around 0.5 Hz. Our statistical study focus on this transition area. Using the twin STEREO probes, launched in October 2006, we study a large amount of magnetic data extending from 2007 to 2013. Thanks to the high resolution magnetic field data provided by the MAG instrument, the spectrum can be computed over a wide frequency range (up to 4 Hz). We conducted a spectral analysis based on the wavelet transform technique using both Daubechies and Morlet wavelets. This analysis reveals some distinct spectral shape. The major part of the spectra are like the classical description with two spectral slopes separated by a transition area more or less well defined. But for around 1% of the spectra we observe clearly defined bump shape. This bump shape is the signature of left and right handed elliptically polarized waves. We compare those different shapes and show that the wave presence is correlated with a low level of turbulence. Furthermore, by combining these results with plasma parameters obtained via the PLASTIC instrument, we try to characterize those waves and discuss their possible origins.",

            "abstract": "Present-day variations in climate, such as drought, influence the physical and geochemical characteristics of cave drip waters. These changes in water chemistry, water flux, and climate through time may be preserved in cave calcite formations (speleothems). In 2011, a record drought began in central Texas, presenting an opportunity to assess the physical and geochemical response of cave drip waters. As part of a long-term cave monitoring study, drip water samples from eight sites in a cave on the Edwards Plateau were collected every 3 to 6 weeks before, during, and after the peak of the 2011 drought and analyzed for major and trace element concentrations. Physical parameters such as calcite growth rate, drip rate, and cave-air CO2 were also monitored.\nWe compare time series of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) with time series of drip rate, calcite growth rate, and water composition. The drip sites show a range of response to drought by these parameters and only some sites record drought via elemental ratios and growth rate. Both drip rate and drip water elemental ratios (Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca) provide insight into water residence time and flow paths within the vadose zone. All sites show some correspondence between drip rates and PDSI and three of the eight have a statistically significant relationship (r2=0.29-0.58, p<0.001). Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios for four out of eight drip sites were higher during drought than during wet periods, consistent with longer residence times and, as a result, more water-rock interaction during droughts. Calcite growth rates of fast dripping sites (mean drip rate greater than 4.5 mL/min) demonstrate a long-term decrease in response to drought. The complexity of drip site response is likely a consequence of the combined effects of prior calcite precipitation (PCP), water-rock interaction, seasonal ventilation of cave-air CO2, and water flux in the vadose zone. The results of this study improve our understanding of variations in the modern cave system due to drought and have implications for selecting speleothems as paleo-drought proxies.",

            "abstract": "The Pantanal of Brazil is one of the world’s largest wetland regions. It is located within the 370,000 km2 Alto Paraguai Basin (BAP). In wet years almost 15% of the total area of the basin can be flooded (approximately 53,000 km2). The hydrological cycle is particularly important in the Pantanal in the transport of materials, and the transfer of energy between atmospheric, aquatic, and terrestrial systems. The INLAND (Integrated Land Surface Model) terrestrial ecosystem model is coupled with the THMB hydrological model to examine the hydrological balance and water dynamics for this region. The INLAND model is based on the IBIS dynamic vegetation model, while THMB represents the river, wetland and lake dynamics of the land surface. The modeled hydrological components are validated with surface and satellite-based estimates of precipitation (gridded observations from CRU v. 3.21, reanalysis data from ERA-interim, and TRMM estimates), evapotranspiration (MODIS and Land Flux-Eval dataset), total runoff (discharge data from ANA-Agência Nacional das Águas – Brazil), and terrestrial water storage (GRACE). Results show that the coupled hydrological model adequately represents the water cycle components, the river discharge and flooded areas. Model simulations are further used to study the influences of climatic variations on the hydrological components, river network, and the inundated areas in the Pantanal.",

            "abstract": "Immiscible displacement of a fluid by another one in rock fractures is relevant for several important underground engineering applications, including hydrocarbon recovery and CO2 sequestration. The spatial distribution of fluid phases and the geometry of fluid-fluid interfaces in fractures cast decisive influence on a range of macroscopic flow parameters. Fluid trapping adds complexity to the analysis of fluid phase distributions and interface geometries. The aperture field of a natural rock fracture exhibits aperture variability, the influence of which on fluid displacement is not yet fully understood. Here we present a numerical investigation of the critical role of aperture variation and spatial correlation on fluid trapping and phase structure. We consider capillary dominated flow in a fracture with normally distributed random apertures. We address both spatially correlated and uncorrelated fracture geometries. The aperture fields are generated by a power spectrum based algorithm. This correlation scale varies among the investigated geometries between L/256 and L/16, L being the fracture largest dimension. The aperture variability is represented by the coefficient of variation (CV), which ranges among the various geometries from 0.05 to 0.25. To simulate fluid displacement we use a newly developed invasion percolation model which has been shown to properly reproduce displacement patterns observed in experiments. We present a quantitative analysis of the size distribution of trapped fluid clusters. The shape of this distribution depends on whether the in-plane curvature, that is, the minor principle component of the interface curvature, parallel to the fracture plane, is taken into account in the numerical model. We show that when the in-plane curvature is not considered, the trapped cluster distribution scales as a power law. When the in-plane curvature is taken into account and the aperture field is uncorrelated, the cluster size distribution also follows a power law, but with a different exponent. In addition, accounting for the in-plane curvature suppresses the formation of trapped clusters of size smaller than the correlation length. This dampening effect is strongly affected by the CV: the smaller the CV, the smaller the number of trapped clusters and the total mass of trapped fluid.",

However, the linkages between geomorphology and ecology remain poorly understood. In rivers, the geomorphic template controls the hydraulic environment, partly shaping the river ecosystem. But what processes shape the geomorphic template? Here, I examine how two hillslope processes dominant in the Oregon Coast Range, debris flows and deep-seated landslides, affect valley floor width and channel slope, key components of the geomorphic template in riverine ecosystems. I then investigate how patterns in potential salmon habitat differ between eleven streams dominated by deep-seated landslides and eleven streams dominated by debris flows. I show that terrain influenced by deep-seated landslides exhibits (1) valley widths that are more variable throughout the network but less locally variable, (2) more variable channel slopes, and (3) more potential salmon habitat as well as significantly more connectivity between habitat types.",

            "abstract": "We present a study of high-temperature, uniaxial deformation experiments of natural magma from an andesitic eruption of Turrialba volcano (1.9ka Plinian eruption). The aim of this work is to investigate the multiphase rheology (liquid+vesicles+crystals) of natural samples and the effect of vesicles and crystals on the magma viscosity. The experiments were performed using a high-temperature uniaxial Geocomp LoadTrac II press at dry atmospheric conditions and controlled deformation rates. Cores of natural sample (with Φcrys=0.20-0.30 and Φves=0.41-0.58) were deformed isothermally (790–870°C) at variable strain rates (VSR, from 10-6 to 10-4 s-1) and constant strain rate (CSR, 10-5 s-1). VSR were performed at low total amount of strain (e<0.10) to parameterize the flow behavior of these complex natural materials. The stress-strain rate relationships under flow conditions showed a linear trend between the applied stress and strain rate in the temperature interval investigated. All the samples display a steep linear trend, typical of Newtonian fluids (n index ~ 1), with a very small shear thinning behavior. CSR tests were performed at different total amount of strain (e=0.15-0.25-0.35). Strain hardening was observed with increasing deformation, resulting in an increase of apparent viscosity (up to 100.5 Pa s). This increase is related to the loss of total porosity (up to ΔΦves=0.15) due to compaction of the sample as indicated by post-run analyses . The measured multiphase rheology of Turrialba magmas was compared with literature models for both crystal- and bubble-bearing suspension. We calculate a difference of ~101 Pa s in magma apparent viscosity between high and low density samples, that coupled with a lateral temperature gradient inside the conduit of the volcano, could increase up to ~103 Pa s. The large difference in viscosity could be responsible of significant rheological contrasts, possibly resulting in strain localization and brittle fragmentation of magma.",

            "abstract": "The drifts of keV ions in the inner magnetosphere are controlled by both electric field drifts and gradient and curvature (i.e., magnetic field) drifts, and further the magnetic field drifts oppose the corotation electric field drift in the dusk local time sector. Consequently, the ion drift paths can be quite complicated with the medium-energy ions drifting close to the Earth, but still being on open drift paths. In addition, structure in the energy-time spectrograms can be a consequence of either particle injection or particle loss. In order to distinguish between the two we will compare the energy-time spectrograms acquired with the Helium Oxygen Proton Electron (HOPE) mass spectrometer on board the Van Allen Probes with predictions of drift path boundaries. The simplest model assumes a uniform convection electric field and dipole model field, and we will use this a starting point for the comparison. The model can be modified to include shielding of the convection electric field, and rotation in local time of the zero-energy dusk-side stagnation point. As an additional check of the model we will compare the electric field used in the model with the electric field as measured by the Van Allen Probes, as well as the validity of using a dipole magnetic field through comparison with the measured magnetic field.",

Basement samples from the Argus Range, Avawatz Mountains, Clark Mountains, Lucy Gray Range, and Spring Mountains record cooling at two distinct periods, ~65 Ma and/or ~50-55 Ma. Detrital He dates from the Miocene Bedrock Spring Formation in the Lava Mountains, a proxy for the cooling age of basement sources in the northern Mojave Desert, also show two distinct peaks. Zircon He dates (n=85) have a peak frequency at ~65 Ma, with ~60% of the grains analyzed ranging from 70-60 Ma; whereas, apatite He dates (n=101) have a strong peak at ~52 Ma, with > 30% of the grains analyzed between 55-50 Ma and the majority between 60-45 Ma. These new ages and dates are similar to published (U-Th)/He, fission-track, 40Ar/39Ar, and K/Ar ages from across the region, suggesting that Late Cretaceous and Eocene cooling events were areally extensive. Paleodepth reconstructions indicate that exhumation during these events was rapid and on the order of kilometers. Late Cretaceous cooling is well documented in the region and may be linked to tectonic exhumation and crustal refrigeration associated with Laramide flat-slab subduction. In contrast, widespread Eocene cooling is more difficult to explain because structures of that age are not known, implying tectonically quiescence. We suggest that this exhumation event may have been caused by rapid erosion following major shifts in global climate associated with the Late Paleocene Thermal Maximum and Early Eocene Climatic Optimum. To strengthen this hypothesis, we link the thermal signature of this denudation event to the climate record and to the terrestrial and marine sedimentary record. Regional cooling age data also show that Eocene exhumation is followed by ~35 m.y. of inactivity in cooling histories, indicating that subsequent erosional exhumation was very slow. Collectively, these data suggest that rapid tectonic exhumation of the Nevadaplano occurred in the latest Cretaceous, whereas erosional beveling and stabilization of the plateau was dominantly an early to middle Eocene phenomenon related to a changing climate.",

These realistic simulations for field sites near Barrow, Alaska expose the model to a wide range of moisture and thermal states that are not tested in published studies. For example, the conventional upwinding of the relative permeability used in the Darcy flux computation can yield a flow into a frozen cell. We also find that infiltration, sources, and sinks must be carefully regulated as flow into frozen portions of the domain, or out of dry or frozen regions can cause unphysical states in the simulation which cause failure. Many straight-forward solutions are not smooth which produce discontinuities in the Jacobian of the nonlinear residual. These difficulties represent a current hurdle to running large-scale permafrost dynamics simulations. We describe these challenges and present approaches to overcoming them in the pursuit of a scalable scheme.",

The WRFD model is governed by the Advanced Research WRF dynamical core, and continuity equations for twelve dust particle sizes that represent the spectrum of mineral dust aerosols observed in the atmosphere. To incorporate dust radiative effects in the model, aerosol optical properties (i.e. optical depth, single scattering albedo, and asymmetric parameters) for all dust sizes are inputted into the shortwave and longwave radiation schemes. By choosing zonal-mean distributions of zonal wind and temperature that are consistent with summer over Northwest Africa, idealized dry simulations explore the nonlinear behavior of AEWs in the presence of dust. The initial zonal-mean dust fields are represented as simple distributions that vary in structure and concentration, which are consistent with observed dust events over Africa. Specific AEW features investigated in the simulations include the evolution of wave energy, Eliassen-Palm fluxes, and spatial structures. Among the questions to be addressed are the following: How does the concentration and spatial distribution of the dust field affect the strength and timing of AEW amplitude saturation? What impact will the dust induced wave fluxes have on the horizontal or vertical shear of the zonal-mean AEJ? Does the interaction between the AEJ, AEW and dust affect the timing and location of the AEW trough, and thus the formation of critical latitudes? Answers to these questions will aid in the understanding and forecasting of AEWs, and their possible subsequent development into tropical storms.",

We compare declining phase solar wind, composed primarily of corotating interaction regions and high-speed streams, and rising phase solar wind, composed mainly of slow solar wind and interplanetary coronal mass ejections, along with the distribution of predicted Jupiter bow shock and magnetopause standoff distances for these intervals. These results are expected to provide data-derived solar wind and IMF boundary conditions at 5 AU for models aimed at studying solar wind-magnetosphere interactions at Jupiter and can support the science investigations of upcoming Jupiter system missions. Here, we provide expectations for Juno, which is scheduled to arrive at Jupiter in July 2016 and identify periods where 1 AU spacecraft can be used to infer the solar wind conditions upstream of Jupiter during the Juno mission.",

Existing parameterisations of such meltrates are usually based on empirical fits to field observations. To understand the meltrates of an ice--water interface more systematically we study an idealised system in terms of its temperature-driven buoyancy forcing. In such systems, the meltrate can be expressed analytically for a stable stratification. Here we investigate the unstable case and present how the meltrate depends on the lake temperature when the water beneath the ice is overturning and turbulent.\nWe use laboratory tank experiments and direct numerical simulations to study an idealised ice--water boundary. The laboratory tank experiments provide robust observation-based mean-temperature profiles. The numerical simulations provide the full three-dimensional structure of the turbulent flow down to scales not accessible in the laboratory, with a minimum 0.2mm gridspacing.\nOur laboratory mean-temperature profiles agree well with the numerical simulations and lend credibility to our numerical setup. The structure of the turbulent flow in our simulations is well described by two self-similar subregions, a diffusion-dominated inner layer close to the ice and a turbulence-dominated outer layer far from the ice. We provide an explicit expression for the parameterisation of the meltrate of a horizontal glacier--lake interface as a function of lake temperature.",

            "abstract": "Historic freshwater sheetflow in the Florida Everglades distributed sediment to form a ridge-and-slough landscape. However, drainage along with reduction and obstruction of flow has resulted in degradation of this ridged topography. The DECOMP Physical Model is a landscape-scale project aiming to reestablish natural sheetflow to the central and southern Everglades by redesigning barriers to flow. To validate proof of concept that increased flow will rebuild ridge-slough microtopography, biomarker proxies were established for ridge and slough organic matter sources. In addition, partial and complete canal backfill options were assessed via sediment trap accumulation in each backfill treatment area. Flocculent matter (floc) and sediment samples were collected, solvent extracted, chromatographically separated, and analyzed on a GC/MS using internal standard for quantification. Four molecular organic biomarkers were evaluated: the aquatic proxy (Paq), highly-branched isoprenoids (C20 HBI), kaurenes and botyrococcenes. Paq, an aquatic proxy of mid to long-chain n-alkanes, was shown to clearly differentiate between ridge-derived and slough-derived organic matter with Paq values increasing along ridge-to-slough transects. Kaurenes indicated presence of ridge-derived organic matter while C20 HBI and botyrococcenes were indicative of periphyton-derived organic matter which is commonly more abundant in sloughs. Biomarker distributions during both low (present day) and high (managed) water flow through the DECOMP experimental parcel were determined and discussed comparatively.",

            "abstract": "The widespread mass extinction that occurred across the Frasnian- Fammenian (F-F) boundary was one of the largest losses of biodiversity in Earth’s history. The F-F extinction interval is expressed in western New York State by two organic rich black shale intervals known as the Upper and Lower Kellwasser events. These shale intervals are well preserved, thermally immature, and are well constrained in age by conodont biostratigraphy, and thus provide an exceptional opportunity to study the organic material originating from the F-F boundary. In order to test hypotheses about the cause(s) and consequences of the FF biotic crisis, a broader knowledge of the organic carbon sources is needed, and a characterization of the marine primary producer communities will assist in this endeavor. One such avenue is through the study of chlorophyll-derived biomarkers (porphyrins).\nThe organic extracts of powdered shale samples from the Kellwasser horizons were analyzed using HPLC/LC-MSn and diode array UV-Vis spectroscopy. Preliminary data from the Kellwasser intervals reveal only one porphyrin, with a mass (M+H) of 600. The UV-Vis absorbance spectrum (Soret = 405nm,\nα = 533nm, β = 570nm) of the metallated compound is consistent with that of a vanadyl porphyrin with a free-base (M+H) of 535. Collision-induced mass spectra displays mass losses of 43 and 57 daltons, which are consistent with an extended alkyl chain at the C-8 position. Extended alkyl chains at C-8 are exclusively associated with porphyrins derived from bacteriochlorophyll c, d or e. The presence of bacterioporphyrins is congruous with the episodic presence of anoxic and sulfidic conditions in the photic zone. What is surprising is that a bacteriochlorophyll- derived porphyrin is the most abundant in these sequences, and their study may help to elucidate the conditions surrounding the F-F mass extinction, and further constrain the fluctuations in marine oxygen content in the Upper Devonian Appalachian Basin.

In this study, we design a laboratory module for an introductory earth science course aimed at improving students' understanding of stock-flow concepts. We have structured the laboratory exercise after Bloom’s taxonomic principles to include comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation. Additionally, we have blended metacognition and self-correction by asking the students to reflect on their learning and by providing cues that enable them to rectify and learn from their own mistakes.

However, how the eddy diffusivity is related to Eulerian properties of the turbulence is not understood. Eulerian and Lagrangian statistics of surfzone eddies are calculated using wave-resolving simulations (with the model funwaveC) of observed SandyDuck conditions. For strong alongshore currents, the model has been validated by comparing modeled and observed Eulerian frequency-wavenumber spectra [Feddersen, 2013]. Here, the model is further validated by comparing observed and modeled characteristic turbulent length and time scales. These Eulerian time TE and length LE scales are found from the moments of the frequency-wavenumber spectra and time-space lagged correlation functions. Lagrangian time TL and length scales LL are also calculated from statistics of virtual drifters advected by the modeled velocity fields. As the turbulent diffusivity K depends on these Lagrangian statistics, K = u2 TL where u2 is the turbulent velocity variance, surfzone eddy diffusivities are also calculated. The cross-shore dependence of both Lagrangian and Eulerian statistics (e.g. TL, LL, TE, LE) are determined and the validity of homogeneous surfzone diffusion is addressed. The relationship between surfzone Lagrangian and Eulerian statistics is also explored and the feasibility of parameterizing surfzone diffusion from incident wave conditions is discussed.",

            "abstract": "Many recent studies have shown the utility of constraining the mean location of tropical precipitation with the zonal energetic budget. Here, we use that framework to understand how the addition of a single continent in one hemisphere changes tropical precipitation in general circulation model (GCM) simulations. We use two GCMs from the GFDL model hierarchy. The first is a gray radiation model (GRaM) that lacks a greenhouse effect and cloud feedbacks, but contains full dynamics. The second is the AM2 model that includes radiative feedbacks and complex physical parameterizations. There is one continent placed in the tropics of the northern hemisphere (NH) in each model; elsewhere, there is a slab ocean model. Two albedos are tested for the continent: one for a \"dark\" continent with an albedo similiar to the ocean and one for a \"light\" continent with a higher albedo. In the GRaM model, advection of hot, dry air off the continent into the deep tropics displaces tropical precipitation into the southern hemisphere (SH). As a result, the location of zonal precipitation is in the SH, despite the NH as a whole being warmer than the SH because of the addition of the continent. The effect is much larger in the simulation with the light continent, which can be explained energetically through the extra reflection of insolation in the NH. In the AM2 simulations, the location of tropical precipitation is also constrained by the energetic budget; however, in addition to the southward deviation of tropical precipitation near the continent, there is a partially compensating northward precipitation displacement that largely depends on the hemispheric imbalance of radiation caused by the higher albedo. This study further highlights the use of energetic arguments to explain changes in the tropical climate. ",

Under the auspices of the Pliocene Modeling and Intercomparison Project (PlioMIP), general circulation models (GCM’s) are being employed to simulate mid-Pliocene climate to better understand the biases in these models, which are presently used to make future climate predictions. \nNecessary boundary conditions for these simulations — land mask, topography, surface albedo and vegetation cover are being provided by the Pliocene Research, Interpretation and Synoptic Mapping (PRISM) project. Bathymetry, which is not part of the PRISM supplied dataset has been adjusted by raising the sea-level by an assumed constant eustatic amount. At present the PRISM land mask, topography and bathymetry reconstructions do not incorporate the gravitationally self consistent changes that would be required to account for the mass loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice-sheets that produced the assumed rise in eustatic sea level. The effects of dynamic topography induced corrections, due to the action of the mantle convection process, have also been neglected.\nThe influence of these corrections on the predictions of Pliocene climate using modern GCM’s remains unexplored. The continuing failure of these models to simulate proxy inferred levels of warming in high-latitude [Dowsett et al., 2013, Sci. Rep.] regions where the magnitude of the required corrections are expected to be largest make it especially important that their impact be assessed. Here, we present the results from a preliminary of the required modifications to the boundary condition data sets.\nWe compute the gravitationally self consistent corrections using the viscoelastic theory of global, glacial isostatic adjustment and relative sea level history for a spherically symmetric Earth model. Dynamic topography related changes are computed using a 3D convection model initialized using seismic tomography. Together, this creates an updated picture of the mid-Pliocene shoreline, topography and bathymetry that can be employed as boundary conditions for future Pliocene climate modeling. ",

            "abstract": "In this study, we investigate the effects of irrigation on global surface water (SW) and groundwater (GW) resources by performing simulations of the Community Land Model 4.0 (CLM4) at 0.5-degree resolution driven by downscaled/bias-corrected historical climate simulations and future projections from five General Circulation Models (GCMs) from 1950-2099. For each climate scenario, three sets of numerical experiments were configured: (1) a control experiment (CTRL) in which all crops are assumed to be rainfed; (2) an irrigation experiment (IRRIG) in which the irrigation module is activated; and (3) a groundwater pumping experiment (PUMP) in which a groundwater pumping scheme coupled with the irrigation module is activated. The parameters associated with irrigation and groundwater pumping were calibrated based on a global inventory of census-based SW and GW use compiled by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO).\nOur results suggest that irrigation could lead to two major opposing effects on SW/GW: SW depletion/GW accumulation in regions with irrigation primarily fed by SW, and SW accumulation/GW depletion in regions with irrigation fed primarily by GW. Furthermore, irrigation depending primarily on SW tends to have larger impacts on low-flow than high-flow conditions of SW, suggesting that intensive irrigation water use has the potential to further exacerbate low-flow conditions, increasing vulnerability to drought. By the end of the 21st century (2070-2099), climate change significantly increases (relative to 1971-2000) irrigation water demand in the regions equipped for irrigation across the world. The increase in demand combined with the increased temporal-spatial variability of water supply will cause more severe issues of local water scarcity for irrigation. Regionally, irrigation has the potential to aggravate climate-induced changes of SW/GW although the effects are negligible when averaged globally. Our results emphasize the importance of accounting for irrigation effects and irrigation sources in regional climate change impact assessment.",

            "abstract": "In January 2014, an international research team embarked on a multidisciplinary ship-based expedition (NBP14-02) to the Totten Glacier/Moscow University Ice Shelf (TG/MUIS) area on the Sabrina Coast, East Antarctica. This system marks the termination of the largest marine-based portion of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS; ~7 m sea level potential), yet little is known about its stability. Recent satellite data indicate regional ice thinning of TG/MUIS, possibly related to ocean-induced basal melt. However, the adjacent continental shelf was not comprehensively surveyed before NBP14-02 due to its remoteness and predominant sea ice cover.\nNBP14-02 scientists conducted physical-chemical, geophysical, and geological surveys of this practically unexplored region to evaluate recent and longer-term ocean-cryosphere linkages. Hydrographic measurements revealed southward transport of relatively warm subsurface waters from near the shelf break to the mid-shelf that weakened farther south near the ice shelf edge, contrary to initial hypotheses. Swath bathymetry mapped many glacial features, suggesting a complex regional glacial and deglacial history. We identified a network of channels scoured into bedrock that were spatially associated with glacial geoforms and may have formed during large subglacial meltwater outbursts. Over 750 km of high-resolution multichannel seismic data were acquired. Seismic profiles revealed the region’s geologic and climatologic history since the onset of Antarctic-Australian rifting, including evidence for: 1. fluvial deltaic systems, 2. intermittent glaciations, 3. the onset of persistent glaciation and significant ice loading, and 4. more recent glacial advance and retreat cycles. Coring and dredging operations, guided by geophysical data, enabled the collection of older sediments from outcropping unconformities and expanded Holocene sequences from restricted basins.\n The multidisciplinary nature of NBP14-02 enabled a rapid, but detailed, baseline assessment of a previously unexplored area. This approach was useful for introducing students to a broad range of oceanographic techniques and ideal for research expeditions subject to the unpredictable nature of the short Antarctic field season.",

            "abstract": "Green infrastructure (GI) measures have been well established as part of low-impact development approaches for stormwater (SW) management. The origin of the concepts, practices and the preponderance of research have taken place in humid climates. Recent work has begun to explore and adapt GI to subhumid and semi-arid climates, which experience warmer and drier periods. But much remains unknown about effects of GI on the water cycle and how to effectively implement to maximize ecosystem benefits. This research synthesizes observation and modeling to address questions related to changes in evapotranspiration (ET), SW runoff volume, and other water cycle processes from GI introduction in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. First, the water budget of green roofs is being studied via weighing lysimeter systems on two rooftop gardens on the University of Utah campus. ET, outflow, and soil moisture have been measured for approximately one year. Up to this early summer, average ET rates for lysimeters of pure medium, Sedums, and Bluegrass are 1.85±1.01, 1.97±0.94, and 2.31±0.91 mm/d respectively; the maximum ET rate could reach 6.11 mm/d from Sedums. Over 2/3 of total rainfall and irrigation were slowly consumed via ET from green roof. Second, the observation studies are leading to new ET modeling techniques that are being incorporated into the U.S. EPA Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). The modified SWMM has been used to simulate ET, SW runoff volume, and overall water budget changes from GI implementation. Preliminary result shows that ET could account for 10% of the total inflows into bioretentions, and 25% of the inflows into landscapes; potential ET rates could vary up to 0.95 mm/hr across 53 subcatchments in the 29 acres catchment. The influence of various design factors for GI on SW runoff reduction and the water budget is also to be estimated. The application of the research is to analyze the water budget of the Red Butte Creek Watershed in Salt Lake City and to explore the necessary GI elements to approach pre-development water budget conditions.",

The array was designed to make detailed observations of the shallow damage zone, local failure processes and noise properties of the Clark Fault near the Anza seismic gap. The core of the array consisted of a grid organized with 20 rows perpendicular to and centered on the fault trace, each row with 50 sensors at a nominal 10 meter interstation spacing. The spacing between rows was nominally 30 meters. The remaining 108 sensors were deployed as extensions to multiple rows providing a maximum 700 meter aperture. Each sensor was surveyed using a Real Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS system to an accuracy of approximately 30 cm. The RTK survey was enabled via ad-hoc networking using HPWREN. We will present observations of earthquakes with magnitudes -1 < M < 4 with hypocentral distances ranging from right below the array out to 100 kilometers, along with prosperities of local structures and noise characteristics.",

            "abstract": "Subaqueous paleoseismological techniques have proved their potential to contribute to the paleoseismological investigations. Sedimentary records of past earthquakes have been mostly represented in lacustrine environments by multi-location coeval mass-wasting deposits and/or soft-sediment deformations. More recently, records of increased sediment influx due to seismically-triggered landslides in lake catchments have been explored by several researchers as well. The most commonly used argument in subaqueous paleoseismology is the temporal correlation between observed sedimentary events and historical earthquakes in the region. This requires precise and robust sediment chronologies, especially if the target is to evaluate earthquake recurrence. Here, we present lacustrine paleoseismological examples from the North Anatolian Fault (NAF, Turkey) and the Húsavík-Flatey Fault (HFF, Iceland). The examples from Turkey illustrate the application of regional time-stratigraphic correlations between proxy records to improve sediment chronologies. The sedimentary records of the lakes along the NAF were successfully correlated with the precisely dated cave deposits and varved lake sediments, which significantly improved the sediment chronologies. On the other hand, the investigations in Iceland benefit from the well-established tephrochronology in the region. Precise sediment chronologies do not only allow us to evaluate the long-term seismic behavior in a region (i.e., earthquake recurrence), but also to improve our understanding of the consequences of earthquakes on lacustrine sedimentation.",

            "abstract": "We introduce a novel energy balance method to estimate evaporation across large lakes using real-time data from moored buoys and mobile, satellite-tracked drifters. Our work is motivated by the need to improve our understanding of the water balance of the Laurentian Great Lakes basin, a complex hydrologic system that comprises 90% of the United States’ and 20% of the world’s fresh surface water. Recently, the lakes experienced record-setting water level drops despite above-average precipitation, and given that lake surface area comprises nearly one third of the entire basin, evaporation is suspected to be the primary driver behind the decrease in water levels. There has historically been a need to measure evaporation over the Great Lakes, and recent hydrological phenomena (including not only record low levels, but also extreme changes in ice cover and surface water temperatures) underscore the urgency of addressing that need. Our method tracks the energy fluxes of the lake system – namely net radiation, heat storage and advection, and Bowen ratio. By measuring each of these energy budget terms and combining the results with mass-transfer based estimates, we can calculate real-time evaporation rates on sub-hourly timescales. To mitigate the cost prohibitive nature of large-scale, distributed energy flux measurements, we present a novel approach in which we leverage existing investments in seasonal buoys (which, while providing intensive, high quality data, are costly and sparsely distributed across the surface of the Great Lakes) and then integrate data from less costly satellite-tracked drifter data. The result is an unprecedented, hierarchical sensor and modeling architecture that can be used to derive estimates of evaporation in real-time through cloud-based computing. We discuss recent deployments of sensor-equipped buoys and drifters, which are beginning to provide us with some of the first in situ measurements of overlake evaporation from Earth’s largest lake system, opening up the potential for improved and integrated monitoring and modeling of the Great Lakes water budget.",

            "abstract": "Accurate age dates for the basement rocks in the South China Sea (SCS) basins were lacking before the execution of International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 349 in early 2014. This left a large margin of error in estimated opening ages for the SCS and rendered various hypotheses regarding its opening mechanism and history untested, hampering our understanding of East Asian tectonic and paleoenvironmental evolution. Therefore, high-precision 40Ar/39Ar age dating lies at the heart of Expedition 349, which in particular aimed to determine the timing of the start and cessation of seafloor spreading in the SCS. In addition, the recovery of a complete seamount apron section at Site U1431 allows 40Ar/39Ar dating of abundantly present plagioclase and biotite crystals to help establish a detailed chronology of the sedimentary and volcaniclastic sequences cored.\nHere we present the first 40Ar/39Ar incremental heating ages on the low-potassium (~0.1-0.2 wt% K2O) and the least altered (loss on ignition < 1.5%) mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) from the SCS. Plagioclase and groundmass samples were prepared using conventional mineral separation techniques, acid-leaching and hand-picking. Analyses were carried out using a new ARGUS-VI multi-collector noble gas mass spectrometer. Ages are expected to have precisions ranging between 0.1-0.3 Ma (2σ), which will allow us to precisely and accurately date the final emplacement of basalts at Sites U1431, U1433 and U1434 in the SCS basin, just prior to the cessation of spreading as all sites were slightly offset from the relict spreading center.",

            "abstract": "Methane flux from wetlands is both a critical component of the global CH4 budget, and highly sensitive to global climate change. Understanding the variability of this CH4 source is essential for improving predictions of biosphere-atmosphere feedbacks to global climate. Gaps in our knowledge of the biological mechanisms that underlie CH4 flux patterns from natural ecosystems limit our ability to scale flux estimates as well as predict future emissions. Process based models, such as the Wetland-Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model used here, are instrumental for testing our understanding of these mechanisms as well as applying them to predict emissions across spatial and temporal scales. Recent incorporation of carbon isotopes into the Wetland-DNDC model has expanded our ability to validate model predictions of the CH4 production, consumption, and transport processes that yield net emissions. To further improve model estimates we quantified the isotopic composition of CH4 emissions from a high latitude wetland underlain by discontinuous permafrost (Stordalen Mire, Sweden) and a temperate wetland (Sallie’s Fen, NH). We used quantum cascade laser technology, linked to automated chambers, to measure δ13C-CH4 at a high temporal frequency and partition net CH4 emissions into its component parts, methanogenesis (including both acetoclastic, and hydrogenotrophic pathways) and methanotrophy (which consumes CH4 primarily via aerobic metabolism). Comparison of this multi-year dataset to wetland-DNDC model simulations of CH4 flux and δ13C highlighted spatial and seasonal drivers associated with vegetation, hydrology and temperature, showing higher fluxes dominated by acetoclastic production in wetter, sedge dominated areas and under warmer conditions. Model predictions of both flux and isotopes most closely matched measured values during peak growing season, with much larger divergence from measurements, especially for δ13C-CH4, during the spring and fall. Together these results provide insights into the role of plant and microbial communities and variable environmental conditions in shaping CH4 production and consumption patterns in diverse wetland ecosystems as well as highlight the need to focus investigations on the processes underlying CH4 dynamics during seasonal transitions.",

            "abstract": "Modern approaches to uncertainty quantification in the subsurface rely on complex procedures of geological modeling combined with numerical simulation of flow & transport. This approach requires long computational times rendering any full Monte Carlo simulation infeasible, in particular solving the flow & transport problem takes hours of computing time in real field problems. This motivated the development of model selection methods aiming to identify a small subset of models that capture important statistics of a larger ensemble of geological model realization. A recent method, based on model selection in metric space, termed distance-kernel method (DKM) allows selecting representative models though kernel k-medoid clustering. The distance defining the metric space is usually based on some approximate flow model. However, the output of an approximate flow model can be multi-variate (reporting heads/pressures, saturation, rates). In addition, the modeler may have information from several other approximate models (e.g. upscaled models) or summary statistical information about geological heterogeneity that could allow for a more accurate selection. In an effort to perform model selection based on multivariate attributes, we rely on functional data analysis which allows for an exploitation of covariances between time-varying multivariate numerical simulation output. Based on mixed functional principal component analysis, we construct a lower dimensional space in which kernel k-medoid clustering is used for model selection. In this work we demonstrate the functional approach on a complex compositional flow problem where the geological uncertainty consists of channels with uncertain spatial distribution of facies, proportions, orientations and geometries. We illustrate that using multivariate attributes and multiple approximate models provides accuracy improvement over using a single attribute.\n ",

            "abstract": "The ability to lower mission operations costs on any long duration mission depends on a number of factors; the opportunities for science, the flight trajectory, and the cruise phase environment, among others. Many deep space missions employ long cruises to their final destination with minimal science activities along the way; others may perform science observations on a near-continuous basis. This paper discusses approaches employed by two NASA missions implemented by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) to minimize mission operations costs without compromising mission success: the New Horizons mission to Pluto, and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatories (STEREO).\nThe New Horizons spacecraft launched in January 2006 for an encounter with the Pluto system.The spacecraft trajectory required no deterministic on-board delta-V, and so the mission ops team then settled in for the rest of its 9.5-year cruise. The spacecraft has spent much of its cruise phase in a “hibernation” mode, which has enabled the spacecraft to be maintained with a small operations team, and minimized the contact time required from the NASA Deep Space Network.\nThe STEREO mission is comprised of two three-axis stabilized sun-staring spacecraft in heliocentric orbit at a distance of 1 AU from the sun. The spacecraft were launched in October 2006. The STEREO instruments operate in a “decoupled” mode from the spacecraft, and from each other.\nSince STEREO operations are largely routine, unattended ground station contact operations were implemented early in the mission. Commands flow from the MOC to be uplinked, and the data recorded on-board is downlinked and relayed back to the MOC. Tools run in the MOC to assess the health and performance of ground system components. Alerts are generated and personnel are notified of any problems. Spacecraft telemetry is similarly monitored and alarmed, thus ensuring safe, reliable, low cost operations.",

            "abstract": "Early Eocene hyperthermals represent large perturbations of the global carbon cycle characterized by significant global temperature increases. The best known and largest episode is represented by the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) also known as the Eocene Thermal Maximum 1 (ETM1), which occurs at ~55.7 Ma. Two other major episodes include the ETM2 (~55.7 Ma) and the ETM3 (~54.3 Ma). Available geochemical and sedimentary records indicates that other hyperthermal events might have occurred during the Paleocene, including the DanC2 event at ~ 65.4 Ma (Quillévéré et al., 2008), Top C27N event at ~61.6 Ma (Westerhold et al., 2008) and the Lower C29N event (Coccioni et al., 2012). A key feature of hyperthermals is the abrupt negative shift in δ13C values, which is interpreted to reflect the release of a large mass of 13C-depleted carbon in the form of CH4 and/or CO2 into the atmosphere-ocean system, causing dramatic warming and ocean acidification (Zachos et al., 2005). Here we present a high resolution biostratigraphic, magnetic susceptibility, and geochemical record of the lower Danian from the Caravaca section (SE Spain). By combining inorganic and organic geochimistry proxies we were able to identify the Dan-C2 event in our section and the Lower C29N event. A sampling spacing of 5 cm corresponding to ~3 kyr in the time domain based on the average sedimentation rate of 1.5 cm/kyr (Smit, 2004) provides a well resolved record of the two events. This resolution can be used to detect short-term periodicity and, therefore, accurately determine the timing of the two events and their duration.",

While accurate, pore-scale models are computationally intensive and impractical for field scale applications. Continuum-scale models have low computational costs, yet they rely on a set of applicability conditions, which, if violated, may affect the model’s predictive capabilities. Hybrid models combine pore- and continuum-scale descriptions in different portions of a computational domain. They are emerging as the method of choice when a localized breakdown of macroscopic equations occurs. We present a non-intrusive hybrid scheme without overlap region and model reactive transport in chemically heterogeneous porous media. The hybrid coupling guarantees continuity of state variables and fluxes at the boundaries between the pore- and the continuum-scale domains through an iterative procedure. The algorithm is tested against different transport regimes and porous media geometries.",

These observational campaigns are a prime opportunity to evaluate and improve weather and air quality models, in particular the finer scales, since the collected observations are not only unique (boundary layer profiles, planetary boundary layer height and LIDAR), but of high spatial density. For the first campaign in the Washington DC-Baltimore region, a number of meteorological model improvements were crucial for quality results at the finer grid scales.\nThe main techniques tested in the DISCOVER-AQ Washington DC-Baltimore experiment were iterative indirect soil nudging, a simple urban parameterization based on highly resolved impervious surface data, and the use of a high resolution 1 km sea surface temperature dataset. A fourth technique, first tested in a separate cold season application in the US Rocky Mountains, was the assimilation of high resolution 1 km SNOw Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) data for better snow cover representation in retrospective modeling. These methods will be leveraged using a nested 12-4-2 km WRF-CMAQ modeling platform for the 2013 DISCOVER-AQ California campaign where the 2 km domain covers the entire San Joaquin Valley (SJV), coastal areas and all of Los Angeles. The purpose is to demonstrate methods to derive high quality meteorology for retrospective air quality modeling over geographically complex areas of the Western US where current coarser resolution modeling may not be sufficient. Accurate air quality modeling is particularly important for California, which has some of the most polluted areas in the US, within the SJV. Furthermore, this work may inform modeling in other areas of the Intermountain West that are experiencing air quality issue as a result of the rapid expansion of the oil and gas extraction industry.",

Time-frequency filtering (TFF) passes only a narrow frequency band centered on the time varying frequency of the seismic source.

Sources of noise include traffic, harmonics generated by the seismic source and the propagating seismic waves. TFF also allows the separate analysis of the source fundamental frequency and each harmonic.

Three vibroseis sources were used: a 45 KN shear shaker, a 450 N portable mass shaker, and a 26 KN vibroseis truck.

Within 2 years more than 2900 hours of observations have been obtained throughout the season.\nWe will present quasi-continuous measurements of temperature profiles in the southern hemisphere mesopause region during the transition from winter to summer in 2011/2012. In a period of 120 days around solstice we have performed lidar observations for a total of 736 hours. PMSE was simultaneously observed by the nearby Davis-MST Radar.\nThe winter/summer transition is identified by a downward shift of the mesopause which occurs on 8 November 2011. Soon after transition, mesopause heights and temperatures are similar to the northern hemisphere (NH) colatitude summer (88 km, 130 K). Around solstice the Mesopause is elevated for several days by 4–5 km and is colder than typical NH temperatures by 10 K. In this period individual profiles show temperatures as low as 100 K. The occurrence of polar mesosphere summer echoes is closely connected to low temperatures. Below 88 to 90 km and in the main summer season of 2011/2012 temperatures at Davis are generally warmer compared to the NH by 5–15 K, whereas temperatures are generally colder above 90 km.\nThe first NLC observed by the lidar occurred very late in the season close to solstice. Most NLC occurred during a period of comparable warm temperatures and high iron number densities in early January. The late occurrence is in agreement with long term observations by the Davis-Lidar (AAD). The late occurrence is a major difference compared to the co-latitude Andoya, 69° N.",

This study investigates the role of glaciation and catchment wide denudation rates in forming the 40.000 km2 large Vakhsh catchment in Tajikistan. The Vakhsh river is located in the Pamir – Tian Shan transition zone. The river drains the North Pamir as well as parts of the Alay Range, which is the western extension of the Tian Shan Mountains. The southward Vakhsh -Trans -Alay thrusting is the expression of ongoing tectonic activity in this area. Today the rate of convergence between the two mountain ranges adds up to at least 15 mm/yr.\nWe analyzed the upstream part of the Vakhsh catchment with in situ-produced cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al in quartz. Modern river samples, terrace depth profiles, and moraine boulder samples were used for quantifying modern and paleo-denudation rates, and timing of the most recent glaciation. A recessional moraine was dated with a total number of 18 boulders and a sequence of five lateral moraines with 41 samples. Results from well-preserved moraines indicate in the North Pamir a maximal glacial extent at around 17 ka (+/- 1.9 ka). The analysis of modern river samples derived from several locations along the main channel of the Vakhsh river reveal denudation rates between 1.8 – 2.6 mm/yr. Spatial variations in denudation were also evaluated using cosmogenic nuclide-derived denudation rates from rivers ranging between Strahler order 4 and 7. Preliminary results for these rates vary between 0.7 and 2.9 mm/yr within the catchments. A correlation between Strahler order and the denudation rate has not been observed. Exposure ages for the lowest, middle, and highest of the 10 terraces are all ~3.2 ka (+/- 0.29 ka) indicating synchronous and rapid terrace formation in the late Holocene. Taken together, these results indicate: a) the most recent maximum extent of glaciation is in this valley is ~17 ka, b) terrace formation significantly post-dates glaciation and is most likely not controlled by glacial-interglacial climate variations, and c) catchment wide denudation rates in this semi arid, tectonically active, and glaciated setting are high, and of a similar magnitude as denudation rates of the monsoon influenced Himalaya.",

            "abstract": "Due to the long electrical wavelengths required along with practical aperture size limitations the scaling of passive microwave remote sensing of soil moisture and salinity from spaceborne low-resolution (~10-100 km) applications to high resolution (~10-1000 m) applications requires use of low flying aerial vehicles. This presentation summarizes the status of a project to develop a commercial small Unmanned Aerial System (sUAS) hosting a microwave radiometer for mapping of soil moisture in precision agriculture and sea surface salinity studies. The project is based on the Tempest electric-powered UAS and a compact L-band (1400-1427 MHz) radiometer developed specifically for extremely small and lightweight aerial platforms or man-portable, tractor, or tower-based applications. Notable in this combination are a highly integrated sUAS/radiometer antenna design and use of both the upwelling emitted signal from the surface and downwelling cold space signal for precise calibration using a unique lobe-differencing correlating radiometer architecture. The system achieves a spatial resolution comparable to the altitude of the UAS above the surface while referencing upwelling measurements to the constant and well-known background temperature of cold space. The radiometer has been tested using analog correlation detection, although future builds will include infrared, near-infrared, and visible (red) sensors for surface temperature and vegetation biomass correction and digital sampling for radio frequency interference mitigation. This NASA-sponsored project is being developed for commercial application in cropland water management (for example, high-value shallow root-zone crops), landslide risk assessment, NASA SMAP satellite validation, and NASA Aquarius salinity stratification studies. The system will ultimately be capable of observing salinity events caused by coastal glacier and estuary fresh water outflow plumes and open ocean rainfall events.",

The diversity of methane-cycling archaea has been intensively studied by exploring 16S ribosomal RNA gene and alpha subunit of methyl coenzyme M reductase gene (mcrA). In marine sediments, methanogens and methane-oxidizing archaea are mainly found in methane zone (MZ) and in sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ), respectively. However, methane-cycling archaea are also present in zones other than their usual residing geochemical zones. Next generation sequencing of mcrA genes from 5 gravity cores shows that both methanogens and methane-oxidizing archaeal group - ANME-1 are ubiquitous in all biogeochemical zones in Aarhus Bay. We will further discuss below questions: which methanogens and methanotrophs are present and active in the presence of sulfate, and which are restricted in SMTZ or MZ? How do activity and pathway of methanogenesis / methanotrophy change with depth and substrate availability?",

            "abstract": "Complex network theory provides a powerful toolbox for studying the structure of statistical interrelationships between multiple time series. In this work, we demonstrate how networks constructed from fields of climatological observables like surface air temperatures, geopotential height or vertically integrated moisture divergence can be used for characterizing the evolving spatio-temporal correlation structure of the Earth’s climate system and the time-dependent coupling between different variables.\nAs a first application, we study the temporal variability of several network characteristics based on global surface air temperature data. The corresponding evolving climate network properties provide a functional discrimination between different large-scale climatological situations associated with different phases of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), as well as reorganizations of dynamical similarity patterns following localized perturbations of the global climate system after strong volcanic eruptions. As a particular application, we demonstrate the distinction between the two previously known El Nino types based on global climate network properties and discuss implications for the possible existence of different La Nina types.\nA second example concerns the spatio-temporal organization of strong evapotranspiration events over South America. By constructing climate networks based on the synchronicity of extreme values in the vertically integrated moisture flux at different locations, we obtain distinct spatial patterns associated with the organization of strong atmospheric upwelling events. Again, our results exhibit a distinct imprint of the phasing of ENSO.\nFinally, we demonstrate how the climate network approach can be extended to studying the interaction structure between two climatological fields. As an example, we discuss the cross-linkage structure of mid-to-high latitude northern hemispheric ocean-atmosphere interactions during summer and winter season, which displays some interesting spatial structures not previously reported.",

            "abstract": "We combine paleoseismic trench and cosmogenic dating results to study the late Pleistocene-Holocene history of morphologically pronounced NW-SE trending Sudetic Marginal Fault (SMF) situated at the northeastern limit of the Bohemian Massif in central Europe. Eighteen trenches were excavated at the Bila Voda site to study 3D distribution of a beheaded alluvial fan on the NE block of the fault and to find the offset “feeder channel” that sourced the deposits. We interpret a small drainage of about 40-60 m to the SE of the fan apex as the feeder channel. A 2.5 m depth profile was collected for cosmogenic exposure dating from a well-preserved part of the fan. Using a simple model that accounts for pre-depositional exposure (inheritance) and assuming no surface erosion, 10Be concentrations are well-fit with an apparent exposure age of ~12 ka. However, this is a minimum limiting age if the surface was eroded by gelifluction in the late Pleistocene. Assuming a ~25 ka OSL age for the base of the fan apex it gives a left-lateral slip rate of ~2 mm/yr. As the Holocene deposits do not show significant displacement, most of the recorded slip took place during Late Pleistocene with corresponding slip rate of 2.8 to 3.5 mm/yr. Bila Voda site lies ~150 km south from the Late Pleistocene Weichselian maximum (~20 ka) ice-sheet front. Thus, we hypothesize that the slip rate acceleration was due to ice-loading and subsequent unloading during deglaciation. To test this, we calculated the stress induced in the lithosphere from ablation of the Weichselian ice sheet modeled as a flexing elastic plate. Preliminary modeling results indicate that complete deglaciation alters the stress field such that it would inhibit left lateral failure on the SMF, consistent with observations suggesting no slip occurred during the Holocene. Although the SMF is ~150 km from the Weichselian ice sheet front, it is well within the flexural rebound area of the ice sheet, causing normal stress on the SMF to vary by ~1 MPa from deglaciation. Our model is consistent with loading mechanisms reported from other regions due to deglaciation, but is the first documented evidence in central Europe, having a great implication for seismic hazard assessment.

            "abstract": "Determining how much to invest in earth observation technology depends in part on the value of information (VOI) that can be derived from the observations. We design a framework and then evaluate the value-in-use of the NASA Gravity Research and Climate Experiment (GRACE) for regional water use and reliability in the presence of drought. As a technology that allows measurement of water storage, the GRACE Data Assimilation System (DAS) provides information that is qualitatively different from that generated by other water data sources. It provides a global, reproducible grid of changes in surface and subsurface water resources on a frequent and regular basis. Major damages from recent events such as the 2012 Midwest drought and the ongoing drought in California motivate the need to understand the VOI from remotely sensed data such as that derived from GRACE DAS.\nOur conceptual framework models a dynamic risk management problem in agriculture. We base the framework on information from stakeholders and subject experts. The economic case for GRACE DAS involves providing better water availability information. In the model, individuals have a “willingness to pay” (wtp) for GRACE DAS – essentially, wtp is an expression of savings in reduced agricultural input costs and for costs that are influenced by regional policy decisions. Our hypothesis is that improvements in decision making can be achieved with GRACE DAS measurements of water storage relative to data collected from groundwater monitoring wells and soil moisture monitors that would be relied on in the absence of GRACE DAS. The VOI is estimated as a comparison of outcomes.\nThe California wine grape industry has features that allow it to be a good case study and a basis for extrapolation to other economic sectors. We model water use in this sector as a sequential decision highlighting the attributes of GRACE DAS input as information for within-season production decisions as well as for longer-term water reliability.",

Paleoseismic evidence for large (M≥7.0) earthquakes on the central Holocene-active fault segments of the 350-km-long Wasatch fault zone (WFZ) generally supports single-segment ruptures but also permits multi-segment rupture scenarios. The extent and frequency of ruptures that span segment boundaries remains poorly known, adding uncertainty to seismic hazard models for this populated region of Utah. To address these uncertainties we conducted four paleoseismic investigations near the Salt Lake City-Provo and Provo-Nephi segment boundaries of the WFZ. We examined an exposure of the WFZ at Maple Canyon (Woodland Hills, UT) and excavated the Flat Canyon trench (Salem, UT), 7 and 11 km, respectively, from the southern tip of the Provo segment. We document evidence for at least five earthquakes at Maple Canyon and four to seven earthquakes that post-date mid-Holocene fan deposits at Flat Canyon. These earthquake chronologies will be compared to seven earthquakes observed in previous trenches on the northern Nephi segment to assess rupture correlation across the Provo-Nephi segment boundary. To assess rupture correlation across the Salt Lake City-Provo segment boundary we excavated the Alpine trench (Alpine, UT), 1 km from the northern tip of the Provo segment, and the Corner Canyon trench (Draper, UT) 1 km from the southern tip of the Salt Lake City segment. We document evidence for six earthquakes at both sites. Ongoing geochronologic analysis (14C, optically stimulated luminescence) will constrain earthquake chronologies and help identify through-going ruptures across these segment boundaries. Analysis of new high-resolution (0.5m) airborne LiDAR along the entire WFZ will quantify latest Quaternary displacements and slip rates and document spatial and temporal slip patterns near fault segment boundaries.",

            "abstract": "Land use and land cover change in the Anthropocene have altered the source, composition, and reactivity of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in aquatic ecosystems around the world. In particular, urbanization increases the abundance of bioavailable DOM in streams. This bioavailable DOM may increase the utilization of less bioavailable pools of DOM via the “priming effect.” The priming effect is a phenomenon whereby the addition of a small amount of labile DOM can increase or decrease the breakdown rate of less bioavailable DOM – positive and negative priming respectively. Our research tests priming as one potential mechanism altering DOM composition and increasing its bioavailability in urban streams. We measured DOM degradation during 30-day incubations in samples from a small urban stream and two microbial DOM sources mixed with DOM from a small stream dominated by less microbial allochthonous sources. We assessed priming by looking at observed percent biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) vs. endmember predicted BDOC. We also investigated the molecular dynamics of priming using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR/MS). Using bulk DOC concentration we found evidence that adding small amounts of DOM from an urban stream could increase BDOC by a factor of two to three. At the molecular level, FT-ICR/MS showed that addition of labile DOM may increase the bioavailability of a variety of compound classes including proteins, lipids, and “black carbon.” Furthermore, we observed that what is frequently reported as positive or negative priming may be more accurately understood as the net balance of simultaneous positive and negative priming operating on different DOM pools. Our results highlight an important global mechanism by which human activities may alter the composition and reactivity of DOM in fresh waters. Priming the degradation of allochthonous DOM with autochthonous or novel anthropogenic DOM may alter the organic energy available for microbially driven ecosystem functions regulating water quality.",

            "abstract": "The UNAVCO GAGE GPS data Analysis Centers (ACs) and Analysis Center Coordinator (ACC) currently process more than 1800 GPS stations. Approximately 1100 of these stations are from the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) network, with 700+ non-PBO stations from COCONet, SCIGN, NGS CORS, and other regional networks. The 700+ stations provide improved coverage across North America plus additional reference frame constraints. The extra stations were incorporated into the standard daily processing stream during a massive reprocessing effort from 2012-2014. The combined, continental-scale data set of all GPS positions spans an 18-year time period from 1996-2014 and not only represents a significant opportunity to explore mm-scale geophysical phenomena, but also allows the examination and comparison of data quality parameters between stations and networks. The overall data quality of PBO and non-PBO stations is investigated using a variety of quality parameters. Signal-to-noise and multipath histories derived from TEQC preprocessing are used to assess instrument health. Quality parameters from daily processing are used for station health determination. Position time series are used for noise analysis to characterize site stability based on white and colored noise. Further anomalies can be identified by direct inspection of a station’s time series, network velocity field, and strain rate. Non-geophysical factors such as monument instability, equipment failure, and incorrect metadata can also affect data quality. Non-PBO stations were built with a variety of monument designs, equipment, and installation practices, and do not generally have consistently recorded operational and maintenance histories in a central database, because stations were installed by various organizations. Our quality analysis will identify any significant differences between PBO and non-PBO stations, and the resulting overview will help inform time series analysis for geophysical investigations.",

            "abstract": "Cruise NBP14-02 surveyed the previously unstudied Moscow University Ice Shelf region, East Antarctica, an area of concern due to recent changes in the glacial system. Using 3.5 kHz sub-bottom geophysical data, we targeted a mid-shelf site with an expanded Holocene sedimentary section, recovering ~ 10 meters of Holocene diatom-rich sediments characterized by an unusual floral assemblage that records the strong and consistent presence of open ocean diatoms. The sedimentary assemblage is dominated by ~50% Fragilariopsis kerguelensis, with a diagnostic contribution of Thalassiosira lentiginosa and Thalassiosira oliverana, species typical of the open Southern Ocean, suggesting southward inflow onto the shelf. A lesser contribution of Fragilariopsis curta indicates the influence of sea ice associated productivity within the polynya. Strong easterly winds and the blocking of sea ice transport into the region by the Dalton Iceberg Tongue to the east appear to be important factors in polynya development and maintenance; sea ice melt within the polynya likely contributes a diatom seed population. Chaetoceros is notably absent, likely due to the polynya opening later in the season (January) and the absence of a typical spring bloom. Unusual Thalassiothrix antarctica layers, up to 15 centimeters thick and comprised of tightly matted valves with a newspaper-like texture, are evident down core. This shade-adapted species can live at depth, maximizing access to nutrients, and is thought to be an under-recognized contributor to oceanic primary productivity due to the patchy subsurface nature of blooms. Thalassiothrix, and other species with a similar thread-like morphology, are often associated with oceanic frontal zones and may be responsible for episodic but significant carbon and silica flux to the sea floor. Temporal variability in the occurrence of Thalassiothrix layers in this Holocene sediment sequence may reflect past changes in the relative proximity and/or strength of Polar and Slope Fronts and/or changes in onshore current flow and strength, transporting large, cohesive diatom mats onto the shelf. Future down core diatom assemblage studies will improve understanding of regional ocean-cryosphere interactions in an environmentally sensitive region.",

            "abstract": "Light is of great importance to the health and ecological function of shallow estuaries. Primary production in such estuaries, which is typically dominated by seagrass, is contingent upon light penetration to the deeper part of the estuarine water column. A major component contributing to light attenuation in these systems is colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). CDOM is most often measured via a proxy, fluorescing dissolved organic matter (fDOM), due to the ease of taking rapid, accurate fDOM measurements. Fluorescence data can then be converted to absorbance by CDOM for use in light attenuation models. However, this fDOM-CDOM conversion has proven to be quite variable between estuaries, and even between sites along a given estuary. We displayed and attempted to explain this variability through the study of three diverse estuaries: West Falmouth Harbor (MA), Barnegat Bay (NJ), and Chincoteague Bay (MD/VA). Land use surrounding these estuaries ranges from wastewater treatment to agricultural operations and residential communities. Measurements of fDOM and absorbance by CDOM (quantified via spectrophotometer measurement of 0.2µm-filtered samples) were taken along a gradient from terrestrial to oceanic end-members. These measurements yielded highly variable fDOM-CDOM relationships between estuaries. The mean ratio of absorption coefficient at 340nm (m-1) to fDOM (QSU) was much higher in West Falmouth Harbor (0.874) than in Barnegat Bay (0.227) and Chincoteague Bay (0.173). This fDOM-CDOM relationship was also observed to be variable between sites within West Falmouth Harbor and Barnegat Bay, but consistent throughout sites along Chincoteague Bay. This variability, both within and between estuaries, is likely due to differing CDOM sources as a result of differences in land use in the areas surrounding these estuaries. Stable carbon isotope analysis of DOC from each site and hydrodynamic model results will be used to differentiate sources and further elucidate the fDOM-CDOM relationship.",

This approach additionally allows us to resolve previous disagreements between groups that studied plate tectonics on super-Earths and to unveil major problems when modeling the thermal evolution of plate tectonics with both 1D and 2D/3D models.\nHow planet properties impact the evolution of plate tectonics is highly sensitive to a planet’s initial thermal conditions, the rheology of mantle rock, the scaling of interior heat and yield stress with planet mass, and especially to whether shear or normal stresses drive plate tectonics.\nBased on the currently most likely model configuration and for planets starting molten, we find that plate tectonics is less likely to occur on super-Earths, for increasing iron and radiogenic heat contents within the mantle, and also with decreasing core to mantle mass fractions. Interestingly, we also find that water within a planet’s mantle has a negative impact on plate tectonics and that only surface water can beneficially impact subduction (but not the initiation of plate tectonics). This emphasizes how the distribution and exchange of water between surface and mantle reservoirs are crucial for plate tectonics, and how difficult it is to find positive water-plate tectonics correlations.",

            "abstract": "Radiocarbon content of intermediate waters originating from the Southern Ocean is held as a likely smoking gun of the events that triggered the atmospheric CO2 rise and its radiocarbon decline during the last glacial-interglacial transition. Late Glacial depleted radiocarbon water masses have been found at intermediate depths off the coast of Baja California, the Galapagos, the Arabian Sea, but not unequivocally elsewhere. Knowing the route of the old water is therefore central for the required mechanistic linkage of Southern Ocean processes and the atmospheric response. A common approach to search for the old water reservoir is the radiocarbon difference between planktonic and benthic foraminifera or 'apparent ventilation age'. Caveats of this approach are due to the fact that it relies strongly on the knowledge of the surface water reservoir age. In this study, we present a high-resolution radiocarbon difference between surface and intermediate depth waters off west Sumatra in the attempt to elucidate a possible route of the old water from its hypothetical source in the high latitudes near Antarctica on its way to the lower latitude sites where it has been observed. Samples come from core SO189-39KL (0°47'S, 99°55'E, 517 m), a 1350 cm hemipelagic sedimentary sequence that spans the last 45,000 years. Radiocarbon determinations were made at centennial time resolution on both planktonic and benthic species. Calibration of the planktonic radiocarbon as age control points allowed us to infer the Δ14C of the intermediate waters. Our results show that throughout the LGM and the entire deglaciation, radiocarbon content of intermediate depths in the area remained with an almost constant age difference with the contemporaneous atmosphere. Unless we have grossly underestimated the local planktonic reservoir age, our results discard this area as a probable route for the spreading of the old water along its way to northern latitudes. In light of recent evidence from the west Pacific that pinpoints an old water mass at 1500-3500 m depth range, our results and our previous ones from the Chilean margin indicate that there was not observable mixing with shallower intermediate depth waters of the southern hemisphere, and that it appearance in northern hemisphere intermediate records reflect mixing processes occurring locally.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic perturbations in a rock mass at great depth cause a complex thermal-hydro-mechanical (THM) response. This is of particular relevance when dealing with enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) and unconventional oil and gas recovery utilizing hydraulic fracturing. Studying the key THM coupled processes associated with specific reservoir characteristics in an EGS are of foremost relevance to establish a heat exchanger able to achieve the target production rate.\nMany reservoirs are naturally low permeable, and the target permeability can only be achieved through the creation of new fractures or inelastic and dilatant shearing of pre-existing discontinuities. The latter process, which is considered to irreversibly increase the apertures of pre-existing discontinuities, has been shown to be especially important for EGS. Common constitutive equations linking the change in hydraulic aperture and the change in mechanical aperture are based on the basic formulation of the cubic law, which linearly relates the flow rate in a fracture to the pressure gradient. However, HM-coupled laboratory investigations demonstrate, that the relation between the mechanical and the hydraulic aperture as assumed in the cubic law, is not valid when dealing with very small initial apertures, which are likely to occur at great depth.\nIn a current study, we investigate the relevance of this discrepancy for the early stage of permeability creation in an EGS, where massive fluid injections trigger largely irreversible in-elastic shearing of critically stressed discontinuities. Understanding small-scale effects in fractures in EGS during fluid injection is crucial to predict reservoir fluid production rates and seismic events.\nOur study aims to implement an empirical constitutive law in an existing discrete fracture code, and calibrate this against experimental data showing the irreversible shearing induced permeability changes. This empirical relation will later be used to quantify the relevance of uncertainties in reservoir characterisation such as discrete fracture networks (DFN) and in-situ state of stress.",

            "abstract": "Excess nitrogen in a river system can cause an overabundance of aquatic plant growth that can cause negative effects on larger water bodies downstream. This can result in eutrophication resulting in large algae blooms that hurt local recreation and fish populations. Recent studies have focused on developing seasonal nutrient forecasts that can be used to control nonpoint reduction strategies. Given that the seasonal nutrients are developed using large-scale climate forecasts, it needs to be pre-processed for ingesting into a water quality model. By considering the LOADEST model, a USGS constituent load estimator, and the Soil &Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) this study quantifies the sources of errors in developing monthly to seasonal nutrient forecasts using climate information. For this purpose, we consider the observed streamflow and nutrient loadings at the Tar River at Tarboro, NC station for developing and testing the water quality models. This streamgage was chosen since it is part of the Hydro-Climatic Data Network (HCDN) which naturally considers basins that are relatively undeveloped with limited storage and pumping. The study also proposes two bias-correction procedures, a bivariate copula-based model and a canonical correlation model, for preserving the cross-correlation structure between the observed nutrients and streamflows. Climate forecasts from the ECHAM4.5 model and NOAA NCEP Climate Forecast System (CFS) will be downscaled and disaggregated for developing nutrient forecasts from the SWAT model and the LOADEST model. Using both the canonical correlation model and the bi-variate copula based bias-correction procedures, the forecasted streamflow and TN loadings will be bias-corrected to preserve the correlation structure. The study will also quantify and compare different sources of errors that propagate in developing monthly to seasonal nutrient forecasts using climate information.",

            "abstract": "The Hybrid Science Data System (HySDS) scalably powers the ingestion, metadata extraction, cataloging, high-volume data processing, and publication of the geodetic data products for the Advanced Rapid Imaging & Analysis for Monitoring Hazard (ARIA-MH) project at JPL. HySDS uses a heterogeneous set of worker nodes from private & public clouds as well as virtual & bare-metal machines to perform every aspect of the traditional science data system.\nFor our science data users, the forefront of HySDS is the facet search interface, FacetView, which allows them to browse, filter, and access the published products. Users are able to explore the collection of product metadata information and apply multiple filters to constrain the result set down to their particular interests. It allows them to download these faceted products for further analysis and generation of derived products. However, we have also employed a novel approach to faceting where it is also used to apply constraints for custom monitoring of products, system resources, and triggers for automated data processing.\nThe power of the facet search interface is well documented across various domains and its usefulness is rooted in the current state of existence of metadata. However, user needs usually extend beyond what is currently present in the data system. A user interested in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data over Kilauea will download them from FacetView but would also want email notification of future incoming scenes. The user may even want that data pushed to a remote workstation for automated processing. Better still, these future products could trigger HySDS to run the user’s analysis on its array of worker nodes, on behalf of the user, and ingest the resulting derived products.\nWe will present our findings in integrating an ancillary, user-defined, system-driven processing system for HySDS that allows users to define faceted rules based on facet constraints and triggers actions when new SAR data products arrive that match the constraints. We will discuss use cases where users have defined rules for the automated generation of InSAR derived products: interferograms for California and Kilauea, time-series analyses, and damage proxy maps. These findings are relevant for science data system development of the proposed NASA-ISRO SAR mission.",

            "abstract": "Lake Tulane is a relatively deep (~23 m) solution lake in south-central Florida. Its depth and location on a structural high, the Lake Wales Ridge, enabled continuous lacustrine sediment accumulation over the past >60,000 years. Pollen in the lake sediments indicate repeated major shifts in the vegetation community, with six peaks in Pinus (pine) abundance that coincide with the most intense cold phases of Dansgaard–Oeschger cycles and the Heinrich events that terminate them. Alternating with Pinus peaks are zones with high relative percentages of Quercus (oak), Ambrosia (ragweed), Lyonia (staggerbush) and Ceratiola (rosemary) pollen, genera that today occupy the most xeric sites on the Florida landscape. This suggests the pollen record indicates the Pinus phases, and therefore Heinrich Events, were wetter than the intervening Quercus phases. To test the connection between Heinrich Events and precipitation in Florida, we analyzed the carbon (δ13C) and hydrogen (δD) isotope signatures of plant biomarkers extracted from the Lake Tulane sediment core as proxies of paleohydrology. The δ13C of plant biomarkers, such as n-alkanes and terpenoids, are determined, in part, by changes in water-use efficiency (WUE = Assimilation/Transpiration) in plant communities, which changes in response to shifts in mean annual precipitation. Plant δ13C values can, therefore, provide a rough indication of precipitation changes when other factors, such as plant community, are relatively stable throughout time. Paleohydrology is also recorded in the δD of plant leaf waxes, which are strongly controlled by precipitation δD. In this region, precipitation δD is negatively correlated with rainfall amount (i.e. the “amount” effect) and positively correlated with aridity. Thus, the δ13C and δD signatures of molecular plant biomarkers provide relative indicators of precipitation change, and when combined, provide a test of our hypothesis that vegetation changes in this region are driven by changes in aridity.",

            "abstract": "There is a need to monitor remedial injections in contaminated fractured rock to determine if targeted areas have been reached and to monitor treatment effectiveness. While detailed information can be obtained at boreholes, these locations are limited; determining connectivity in fracture networks is difficult and borehole monitoring locations may miss the injection entirely. The primary and secondary domains in fractured rock have hydraulic conductivities that differ by orders of magnitude such that tracer injections commonly have rapid breakthrough followed by extended tailings. Often, it is presumed that the tracer is transported into dead-end pore spaces or unknown inter-connected networks and/or sorbed into the primary porosity. Cross-borehole electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), guided by information from borehole geophysical logging and hydraulic testing, has the potential to monitor the fate of tracer injections between borehole locations. ERT has been under-exploited in fractured rock due to: (1) a lack of available 3D codes, (2) a lack of computing resources to accommodate a large number of model parameters, and (3) limitations of regularization constraints used in ERT modeling for representing fractured rock settings along with a full understanding of these constraints. Recognizing numerous advances in ERT imaging and building on our previous studies, we present results from a field-scale ERT experiment in fractured rock. We use ERT to monitor a conductive tracer injection in a fractured mudstone at the Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC) in New Jersey. A custom-built electrode array included inflatable bladders to isolate fractures within each borehole and allowed for discrete water sampling and injection. By injecting the tracer in pulses and collecting 3D ERT measurements following each pulse, we were able to (1) avoid rapid breakthrough and large dilution rates and thus maintain a high conductivity contrast, and (2) characterize ambient flow by simulating static conditions after each pulse. Our findings show unanticipated tracer migration pathways between borehole locations and evidence for diffusion of tracer mass into the rock matrix over time. Identifying such transport processes using advances in ERT imaging will facilitate remedial injections to targeted areas.",

            "abstract": "The magnetosheath (MS) acts as a natural interface between the solar wind (SW) and magnetospheric (MSP) plasma and is therefore a key element in studying the driving of plasma properties in the inner MSP. However, understanding the behaviour of MS plasma properties due to the rapidly changing upstream conditions is no trivial matter and to date is not completely understood. Since the MS is situated between two very dynamic boundaries which respond directly to SW variations, their motion is significant to the order of several Earth radii. The combination of the spatial boundary variations and the non uniform nature of the SW not only make the compilation of statistical data problematic, but their interpretation is by no means straightforward. As a result, it is very difficult to build a complete picture of the global SW - MS - MSP system which accounts for upstream variations outside of the simulated environment. In the present study, we describe a statistical mapping methodology aimed at overcoming such difficulties. Our tool compiles statistical datasets for the MS and MSP in a normalised frame accounting for boundary motion, upstream SW variations and planetary aberration. We use THEMIS measurements for MS and MSP data whereas upstream estimates are provided by the OMNI database. Multiple datasets are compiled to produce statistical maps of the MS and MSP system and also to perform numerical analysis of the properties in each region. We use this methodology to study the presence of dawn/dusk asymmetries and their dependence on upstream conditions.",

Understanding this variability is important for emission controls, health impacts, and photochemistry. However, due the short lifetime of NO2, its variability is difficult to capture. Ground based monitors are extremely important to evaluate satellite column measurements and provide more detailed spatial information. Unfortunately, ground monitors are limited in number and geographically sparse. The DISCOVER-AQ campaign provides a unique dataset that allows for the assessment of spatial variability from aircraft in-situ measurements on the NASA P-3B, remote sensing measurements from the Airborne Compact Atmospheric Mapper (ACAM) on the NASA UC-12 and NASA B200, and ground site measurements over the same area. We use first order structure functions to provide an analysis of spatial gradients over a given distance seen by the P-3B in-situ instruments and ACAM. The spatial variability of these measurements are then compared to ground measurements across the flight domain. Column densities are also calculated from the DISCOVER-AQ vertical profiles to assess the variability of a column within the aircraft profile. Results show that spatial variability depends on the airmass being sampled, polluted versus background conditions.",

            "abstract": "Organic aerosols are emitted into the atmosphere from a variety of sources and display a wide range of effectiveness in promoting the nucleation of ice in clouds. Soot and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS) arise from incomplete combustion and other pollutant sources. Hydrocarbon compounds in diesel motor oil and other fuel blends include compounds such as octacosane (a straight saturated alkane), squalane (a branched saturated alkane) and squalene (an unsaturated branched alkene). At temperatures above -36°C, the formation of ice crystals in the atmosphere is facilitated by heterogeneous freezing processes in which atmospheric aerosols act as ice nuclei (IN). The variability in ability of organic particles to facilitate heterogeneous ice nucleation causes major uncertainties in predictions of aerosol effects on climate. Further, atmospheric aerosol composition and ice nucleation ability can be altered via chemical aging and reactions with atmospheric oxidants such as ozone. In this study, we take a closer look at the role of chemical oxidation on the efficiency of specific IN during contact freezing laboratory experiments. The freezing temperatures of droplets in contact with representative organic aerosols are determined through the use of an optical microscope apparatus equipped with a cooling stage and a digital camera. Chemical changes at the surface of aerosols due to ozone exposure are characterized using Raman Microspectroscopy and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy with Horizontal Attenuated Total Reflectance. Our results indicate that oxidation of certain atmospheric organics (soot and PAHS) enhances their ice nucleation ability. In this presentation, results of heterogeneous nucleation on various types of organic aerosols will be presented, and the role of structure in promoting freezing will be discussed.",

The results were found to be broadly consistent with the vertically limited and vertically smoothed (although better spatially and temporally resolved) results from the more numerous MGS TES nadir temperature retrievals (e.g., Wilson et al., 2002, Banfield et al., 2003, Banfield et al. 2004).\nThe MGS TES Limb-scan retrievals were used to compute a measure of the Diurnal Kelvin Waves (DK1 And DK2). The structures revealed are consistent with theory, and indicative of the importance of these wave modes at aerobraking altitudes (e.g., Wilson 2000, Forbes & Hagan, 2000, Wilson, 2002). The stationary wave structures revealed in the limb retrievals show the winter polar waves in both hemispheres continue to have their maximum amplitude aligned along the polar vortices, even for altitudes above 4 scale heights. The phase structures in and above the stationary waves revealed by the limb retrievals are consistent with the nadir results and the heat fluxes computed in those analyses (Banfield et al., 2003).\nThe winter polar vortex zonal wavenumber 1 traveling waves continue along the edge of the polar vortex, reaching to 6 or more scale heights altitude in the northern winter and extending between 60N and the north pole. The peak amplitudes for these zonal wavenumber 1 traveling waves were found to lie at about 4 scale heights altitude. The limb retrievals revealed more clear evidence of a northern fall equinoctial global traveling wave mode having expression not only in the mid-latitudes in both hemispheres, but also out of phase above the tropics at altitudes above 4 scale heights. Zonal wavenumber 2 & 3 traveling waves could not be reliably retrieved from the limb retrievals.",

            "abstract": "A wide array of human-induced disturbances can alter the structure and function of forests, including climate change, disturbance and management. While there have been numerous studies on climate change impacts on forests, interactions of management with changing climate and natural disturbance are poorly studied. Forecasts of the range of plausible responses of forests to climate change and management are need for informed decision making on new management approaches under changing climate, as well as adaptation strategies for coming decades. Terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) provide an excellent opportunity to investigate and assess simultaneous responses of terrestrial ecosystems to climatic perturbations and management across multiple spatio-temporal scales, but currently do not represent a wide array of management activities known to impact carbon, water, surface energy fluxes, and biodiversity.\nThe Ecosystem Demography model 2 (ED2) incorporates non-linear impacts of fine-scale (~10-1 km) heterogeneity in ecosystem structure both horizontally and vertically at a plant level. Therefore it is an ideal candidate to incorporate different forest management practices and test various hypotheses under changing climate and across various spatial scales. The management practices that we implemented were: clear-cut, conversion, planting, partial harvest, low intensity fire, restoration, salvage, and herbicide. The results were validated against observed data across 8 different sites in the U.S. Southeast (Duke Forest, Joseph Jones Ecological Research Center, North Carolina Loblolly Pine, and Ordway-Swisher Biological Station) and Pacific Northwest (Metolius Research Natural Area, H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Wind River Field Station, and Mount Rainier National Park). These sites differ in regards to climate, vegetation, soil, and historical land disturbance as well as management approaches. Results showed that different management practices could successfully and realistically be implemented in the ED2 model at a site level. Moreover, sensitivity analyses determined the most important processes at different spatial scales, and also those which could be ignored while minimizing overall error.",

            "abstract": "We report the principal components derived from the solar background magnetic field (SBMF in cycles 21-23) in a form of pairs of magnetic waves travelling with a phase shift from one hemisphere to another and analysed with the symbolic regression technique using Hamiltonian principles. This analysis allowed us to uncover the underlying mathematical laws governing these complex waves in the solar background magnetic field and to extrapolate these PCs to the cycles 24-26. The PCs predicted for cycle 24 fit very closely (with accuracy better than 98%) the PCs derived from the SBMF observations. This approach predicts a strong reduction of the solar background magnetic field in cycles 25 and 26 and, thus, a reduction of the resulting solar activity. This decrease is accompanied by an increasing phase shift between the two predicted principal components (magnetic waves) in cycle 25 leading to their full separation into the opposite hemispheres in cycle 26. The derived mathematical laws in PCs are also used to predict the dynamics of solar magnetic waves on larger temporal scales of centuries. The derived variations of PCs in SBMF are probed by the modified two layers Parker’s dynamo model allowing us to predict on the similar temporal scale the evolution of the solar activity which reveal a remarkable close fit to the observations.",

            "abstract": "We surveyed continuous seismic data recorded at two seismic stations in Yellowstone National Park that are located near to Yellowstone National Park's Upper and Lower Falls. Lower Falls is the largest waterfall in Yellowstone, with an estimated flow rate of 70 cubic meters per second, falling an estimated 94 meters, while the Upper Falls has a flow of 70 cubic meters per second, jetting over a 21 meter gap downward 33 meters.\nA study based on a deployment of seismometers in Yellowstone in September and October of 1972 had found a predominant 2 Hz signal associated with the Lower Falls, with the signal remaining above background noise within 6 km of the falls in every direction but the south.\nStation YUF is a three-component, broadband seismometer operated by the University of Utah Seismograph Stations that is located approximately 1.5 km southwest of the Lower Falls, while station B206 is a three-component, short-period, borehole seismometer operated by the Plate Boundary Observatory, located roughly 1.2 km west of the Lower Falls. We computed power spectral densities (PSD) for all available hour-long segments of continuous data from the vertical components of YUF and B206 beginning September 22, 2006 and July 10, 2008, respectively. Yearly spectrograms were used to visualize the PSDs.\nBoth stations showed spectral peaks in the double-frequency microseismic band, with stronger amplitudes in winter than in summer, presumably generated mainly by storms in the North Pacific. Both also showed strong peaks near a period of 1 s, but with the opposite seasonal dependence. This 1 s peak signal broadens in frequency during the summer, from 1 to 5 Hz, as well as uniformly increasing in power across this band. This short-period noise was compared to discharge measurements of the Yellowstone River made at the Yellowstone Lake outlet, about 18.5 km upstream from the Upper Falls. For periods of 0.5-2.0 s the correlation coefficient between the seismic energy and the river discharge rate was as high as .97. We are currently extending the analysis to polarization of the three-component seismic data to determine the relative contribution of the two falls.",

In particular, comparisons from the satellite-derived forecast are shown against several SURFRAD sites, with particular attention to developing meaningful error metrics to better demonstrate forecast skill and identify sources of error. Challenges in advection-based forecast techniques, such as forecasting near regions of non-wind-driven cloud systems such as coastal marine stratocumulus, are described, as are methods integrated into the forecast algorithm to identify and address these challenges. Improvements in the particular algorithm with respect to comparison against surface observations, integration of the forecast technique into blended forecast products such as those described by the 'Public-Private-Academic Partnership to Advance Solar Power Forecasting' project spearheaded by the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and other observations germane to satellite-derived solar forecasting are covered using nearly two years of operational forecasts as background.",

We then evaluate how these metrics are changing over time, and compare the resulting change in the likelihood of regional yield reduction events to other systemic factors.",

            "abstract": "Many regions of southern UK experienced severe flooding during the 2013/2014 winter. Simultaneously, large areas in the USA and Canada were struck by prolonged cold weather. At the time, the media and public asked whether the general rainy conditions over northern Europe and the cold weather over North America were caused by climate change. Providing an answer to this question is not trivial, but recent studies show that probabilistic event attribution is feasible.\nUsing the citizen science project weather@home, we ran over 40’000 perturbed initial condition simulations of the 2013/2014 winter. These simulations fall into two categories: one set aims at simulating the world with climate change using observed sea surface temperatures while the second set is run with sea surface temperatures corresponding to a world that might have been without climate change. The relevant modelled variables are then downscaled by a hydrological model to obtain river flows. First results show that anthropogenic climate change led to a small but significant increase in the fractional attributable risk for 30-days peak flows for the river Thames.\nA single number can summarize the final result from probabilistic attribution studies indicating, for example, an increase, decrease or no change to the risk of the event occurring. However, communicating this to the public, media and other scientists remains challenging. The assumptions made in the chain of models used need to be explained. In addition, extreme events, like the UK floods of the 2013/2014 winter, are usually caused by a range of factors. While heavy precipitation events can be caused by dynamic and/or thermodynamic processes, floods occur only partly as a response to heavy precipitation. Depending on the catchment, they can be largely due to soil properties and conditions of the previous months. Probabilistic attribution studies are multidisciplinary and therefore all aspects need to be communicated properly.",

            "abstract": "Normal modes are the vibrating patterns of the Earth in response to the large earthquakes. Normal mode spectra are split due to Earth’s rotation, ellipticity, and heterogeneity. The normal mode splitting is visualized through splitting functions, which represent the local radial average of Earth’s structure seen by a mode of vibration. The analysis of the splitting of normal modes can provide unique information about the lateral variation of the Earth’s elastic properties that cannot be directly imaged in body wave tomographic images. The non-linear iterative spectral fitting of the observed complex spectra and autoregressive linear inversion have been widely utilized to compute the Earth’s 3-D structure. However, the non-linear inversion requires a model of the earthquake source and the retrieved 3-D structure is sensitive to the initial constraints. In contrast, the autoregressive linear inversion does not require the source model. However, this method requires many events to achieve full convergence. In addition, significant disagreement exists between different studies because of the non-uniqueness of the problem and limitations of different methods.\nWe thus apply the neighbourhood algorithm (NA) to measure splitting functions. The NA is an efficient model space search technique and works in two steps: In the first step, the algorithm finds all the models compatible with given data while the posterior probability density of the model parameters are obtained in the second step. The NA can address the problem of non-uniqueness by taking advantage of random sampling of the full model space. The parameter trade-offs are conveniently visualized using joint marginal distributions. In addition, structure coefficients uncertainties can be extracted from the posterior probability distribution. After demonstrating the feasibility of NA with synthetic examples, we compute the splitting functions for the mode 13S2 (sensitive to the inner core) from several large earthquakes. We confirm earlier observations of this mode and demonstrate that the newly developed technique is capable of reconstructing normal modes with fewer events.",

In correlation with plasma data from the ASPERA instrument, Analyser of Space Plasma and Energetic Atoms, we identify 550 time intervals, at 1 Hz resolution, when VEX is in the solar wind and which satisfy selection criteria defined based on the amount and the continuity of the data. We identify 118 time intervals that correspond to fast solar wind. We compute the power spectral densities (PSD) for Bx, By, Bz, B, B2, B|| and B^. We perform a statistical analysis of the spectral indices computed for each of the PSD's and evidence a dependence of the spectral index on the solar wind velocity and a slight difference in power content between parallel and perpendicular components of the magnetic field.

            "abstract": "Most watershed studies include observation-based water budget analyses to develop first-order estimates of significant flow terms. Surface-water/groundwater (SWGW) exchange is typically assumed to be equal to the residual of the sum of inflows and outflows in a watershed. These estimates of SWGW exchange, however, are highly uncertain as a result of the propagation of uncertainty inherent in the calculation or processing of the other terms of the water budget, such as stage-area-volume relations, and uncertainties associated with land-cover based evapotranspiration (ET) rate estimates. Furthermore, the uncertainty of estimated SWGW exchanges can be magnified in large wetland systems that transition from dry to wet during wet periods. Although it is well understood that observation-based estimates of SWGW exchange are uncertain it is uncommon for the uncertainty of these estimates to be directly quantified. High-level programming languages like Python can greatly reduce the effort required to (1) quantify the uncertainty of estimated SWGW exchange in large wetland systems and (2) evaluate how different approaches for partitioning land-cover data in a watershed may affect the water-budget uncertainty.\nWe have used Python with the Numpy, Scipy.stats, and pyDOE packages to implement an unconstrained Monte Carlo approach with Latin Hypercube sampling to quantify the uncertainty of monthly estimates of SWGW exchange in the Floral City watershed of the Tsala Apopka wetland system in west-central Florida, USA. Possible sources of uncertainty in the water budget analysis include rainfall, ET, canal discharge, and land/bathymetric surface elevations. Each of these input variables was assigned a probability distribution based on observation error or spanning the range of probable values. The Monte Carlo integration process exposes the uncertainties in land-cover based ET rate estimates as the dominant contributor to the uncertainty in SWGW exchange estimates. We will discuss the uncertainty of SWGW exchange estimates using an ET model that partitions the watershed into open water and wetland land-cover types. We will also discuss the uncertainty of SWGW exchange estimates calculated using ET models partitioned into additional land-cover types.",

            "abstract": "The recent Canterbury earthquake sequence (CES) renewed public and academic awareness concerning the clustered nature of seismicity. Multiple event occurrence in short time and space intervals is reminiscent of aftershock sequences, but aftershock is a statistical definition, not a label one can give an earthquake in real-time. Aftershocks are defined collectively as what creates the Omori event rate decay after a large event or are defined as what is taken away as “dependent events” using a declustering method. It is noteworthy that depending on the declustering method used on the Canterbury earthquake sequence, the number of independent events varies a lot. This lack of unambiguous definition of aftershocks leads to the need to investigate the amount of clustering inherent in “declustered” risk models. This is the task we concentrate on in this contribution. We start from a background source model for the Canterbury region, in which 1) centroids of events of given magnitude are distributed using a latin-hypercube lattice, 2) following the range of preferential orientations determined from stress maps and focal mechanism, 3) with length determined using the local scaling relationship and 4) rates from a and b values derived from the declustered pre-2010 catalog. We then proceed to create tens of thousands of realizations of 6 to 20 year periods, and we define criteria to identify which successions of events in the region would be perceived as a sequence. Note that the spatial clustering expected is a lower end compared to a fully uniform distribution of events. Then we perform the same exercise with rates and b-values determined from the catalog including the CES. If the pre-2010 catalog was long (or rich) enough, then the computed \"stationary\" rates calculated from it would include the CES declustered events (by construction, regardless of the physical meaning of or relationship between those events). In regions of low seismicity rate (e.g., Canterbury before 2010), it is hard to know how long is long enough. Using simulations, we can look at the apparent activity rate for the region over a few years (for example for events above M5.8), see how often it exceeds some level and also long those high activity rate periods last on average.",

            "abstract": "To balance the ocean’s uranium budget it may be necessary to invoke submarine groundwater discharge as a major source for uranium. However, uranium removal from seawater has been observed in coastal aquifers where steep redox gradients at the seawater-freshwater mixing zone result in the reduction of soluble U(IV) to insoluble U(IV). We investigated uranium cycling in groundwater within a permeable sand subterranean estuary in Waquoit Bay, MA using major and trace element chemistry as well as ∂234U measurements. Groundwater and sediment samples were collected across the seawater-freshwater mixing zone. In the groundwater samples uranium does not behave conservatively. During mixing it is removed in the intermediate salinities (3–4 m; 2–12 salinity; 0.1 nM U) and enriched in higher salinities (4–6 m; 20-25 salinity; 32 nM) while in salinities >25, uranium is again removed (7–8 m; 8 nM). Geochemical modeling suggests that U is removed at the seawater-freshwater interface by adsorption to Mn-oxides (3–4 m) while in the deeper saline aquifer (7–8 m), U is removed through reduction from U(VI) to U(IV). Surprisingly, while ∂234U is above secular equilibrium in both the freshwater and seawater, within the intermediate salinities ∂234U is depleted below secular equilibrium (as much as ∂234U = -50). Sediment samples were subjected to a partial leach to extract surface-exchangeable U. This leach was analyzed for ∂234U and found to be highly depleted (∂234U -80 – -20). Based on the depleted ∂234U of the sediment leaches and groundwater, we hypothesize that the high U concentrations observed within the intermediate salinities likely have a sediment source. This also implies that U within this intermediate salinity zone must have a long residence time relative to groundwater-surface water exchange rates. This might be possible if redox boundaries and Mn-oxides act as a barrier to U in the intermediate salinities allowing U leached from sediments to accumulate. Therefore, while we observe mechanisms for U removal and addition during submarine groundwater discharge, it appears that removal may be the dominant control with regards to the marine U budget. Finally, we have collected samples for ∂238U measurements which, when complete, may provide additional information on the mechanisms for U removal within the subterranean estuary.",

            "abstract": "More than half a century after the plate tectonic revolution, the physical mechanism that distinguishes tectonically active plate boundaries from stable continental interiors remains nebulous. Rock flow strength and mass density variations both contribute to stress, so both are certain to be important, but these depend ambiguously on rock lithology, temperature, and concentrations of water. High seismic velocities observed to great depths often are interpreted as evidence that geothermal variations dominate patterns of lithospheric strength. However, mantle seismic velocities are sensitive to flow-induced anelastic attenuation as well as to temperature. A more ductile mantle will propagate waves more slowly regardless of whether low viscosity is a consequence of high temperature or of high water fugacity, complicating interpretations of seismic velocity in the absence of other constraints. Here we use EarthScope’s USArray seismic data to independently constrain crustal thickness, bulk crustal lithology and Moho temperature of the lithosphere, and magnetic bottom measurements to refine the crustal geotherm. Strength models based on these quantities are then compared to integral measurements of western U.S. isostatic strength expressed as effective elastic thickness, Te. We show that mantle water is the primary factor that distinguishes stable lithosphere of North America’s cratonic interior from actively deforming zones in the western U.S. Cordillera. Seismic and magnetic constraints on temperature and lithology variations can be reconciled with integral strength measurements only if water fugacity within the lithospheric column is permitted to vary from near-saturation in deforming, mobile lithosphere to nearly completely dry in the stable cratonic interior.",

The photos highlighted in this case were taken in the afternoon of Friday, 13 June 2014. These photos were chosen because they may allow for focused analysis of terrain effects on cloud evolution. Stratocumulus and other cumuliform, as well as cirrus clouds were captured as the sun set over the Tasman Sea, one of the South Pacific Ocean’s marginal seas. Breaks in the thin band of stratocumulus along the shoreline, as well as the total time for cloud layer dissipation are also of interest. A possible barrier jet causing the southward motion of the stratocumulus layer is also investigated. Views look northwest from Serpentine Road in Kumara Junction, South Island, New Zealand.\nAn Integrated Sounding System (ISS) located at the Hokitika Airport was the primary source of vertical profiles. The upper air sounding closest to the shoot time and location, plotted from Hokitika’s 11:05 UTC upsonde data, shows 10 mph NE winds near the surface. Images were taken on days with research flights over New Zealand from 2 June to 23 June 2014 to match DEEPWAVE objectives. On the night of 13 June 2014, NSF/NCAR’s HIAPER GV research aircraft completed a flight from Christchurch over the South Island. This flight became known as Intensive Observing Period 3 (IOP 3) Sensitivity Flight.\nMethods applied in the Terrain-Induced Rotor Experiment (T-REX) by Grubišić and Grubišić (2007) were closely followed while capturing stereo photographic images. Two identical cameras were positioned with a separation baseline near 270 meters. Each camera was tilted upward approximately seven degrees and carefully positioned to capture parallel fields of view of the site. Developing clouds were captured using synchronized camera timers on a five second interval. Ultimately, cloud locations and measurements can be determined using the recorded GPS locations of the cameras. The Camera Calibration Toolbox available for MATLAB was used in order to perform these elaborate triangulation calculations.",

Its data have been used to retrieve the sea surface salinity (SSS) using the Combined Active and Passive (CAP) algorithm with an accuracy of about 0.1 to 0.2 psu Root-Mean-Square between 40 degrees N and 40 degrees S. In addition to the salinity product, Aquarius radiometer data have been used to produce the surface soil moisture globally. We find that the change of soil moisture over the India subcontinent clearly correlates with the timing of India Monsoon, which produces significant precipitation between June and September, and is consistent with the total land mass change derived from the GRACE mission data. We analyzed the time series of Aquarius soil moisture over the India subcontinent, Ganges river discharge and Aquarius surface salinity in the Bay of Bengal (BOB). There is excellent correlation between the river discharge and soil moisture throughout all seasons. However the change of surface salinity in the BOB seems to fall behind the change of soil moisture and river discharge by about 2 months before the monsoon season starts in June. This suggests that lighter precipitation before June does not have immediate impact on the surface salinity in the BOB. Once the heavier precipitation starts in June, the surface salinity in the BOB shows a rapid drop and the river discharge continues to rise until September when the monsoon season ends. We also compared the time series of Aquarius surface salinity in the BOB with the ARGO-gridded data produced by the Asia-Pacific Data-Research Center (APDRC). The comparison suggests that the Aquarius surface salinity in general agrees with the APDRC to within about 0.5 psu off the monsoon season, while during the monsoon season the Aquarius surface salinity tends to be below the APDRC by 1 to 3 psu. Our correlative analysis indicates that the larger discrepancy in August and September is likely due to the surface stratification resulting from rain or river discharge, while the evaporation appears to dominate the change of surface salinity from March to May.",

The model is forced using both additive and multiplicative, white and colored noise and it is shown that, through a suitable choice of the noise intensity, both additive and multiplicative noise can produce similar dynamics. We use a recently developed measure, histogram distance, to show the similarity between the dynamics produced by additive and multiplicative forcing. This phenomenon, in a nonlinear fractal structure with chaotic dynamics can be explained by understanding how noise affects the Unstable Periodic Orbits (UPOs) of the system. For delta-correlated noise, the UPOs erode the fractal structure. In the presence of memory in the noise forcing, the time scale of the noise starts to interact with the period of some UPO and, depending on the noise intensity, stochastic resonance may be observed. This also explains the mixing in dissipative dynamical systems in presence of white noise; as the fractal structure is smoothed, the decay of correlations is enhanced, and hence the rate of mixing increases with noise intensity.",

The results presented here investigate the transferability of these techniques using AMSR-E to predict Tb observations as measured by AMSR2. In other words, can historical AMSR-E Tb observations be used to train a ML algorithm in order to predict Tb observations collected by AMSR2 at some point in the future? The NASA Catchment Land Surface Model is first used to characterize snowpack conditions. Next, the ML algorithm is trained on the 9-year record of PMW Tb observations collected by AMSR-E. An additional experiment where the ML algorithm was trained on a split-sample of the 2-year record of AMSR2 PMW Tb observations was conducted for comparison. Results suggest one ML technique – the support vector machine – when trained on AMSR-E observations can sufficiently reproduce AMSR2 Tb in forested and non-forested regions during both the snow accumulation and snow ablation phases of the snow season. These results suggest transferability of machine learning from the AMSR-E sensor to other data records with comparable frequency and polarization characteristics. The eventual goal is to use a ML algorithm as an observation operator within an ensemble-based data assimilation framework where model estimates will be merged with PMW Tb observations in order to improve snow water equivalent (SWE) estimates across regional and continental scales.",

We utilized data collected during the MARVEL 2000 cruise AT3-60, specifically Alvin videos and rock samples, Argo II digital still photos, and TOBI/DSL-120 side-scan sonar mosaic. The Alvin dives studied occurred over the Central Dome and Eastern Block, which is interpreted as the hanging wall to the detachment that unroofed the dome. We also studied two Argo II dives located over the Central Dome, one over the Eastern Block, and one over the Western Shoulder of the southern dome. The TOBI/DSL-120 side-scan sonar followed a widespread, looped track providing near total coverage of the massif. We classified the character of the seafloor based on imagery, the acoustic reflectivity, and the basic composition of rock samples. To aid in our classification, we merged Argo II still images to produce photo-mosaics displaying tens of meters long transects. We then classified the seafloor as unconsolidated sediment, lithified sediment (a carbonate crust or cap), exposed bedrock, or rubble. To obtain a broader understanding of the Atlantis Massif, we analyzed the distribution of these classes of seafloor.

            "abstract": "Dissolved organic matter (DOM) exported from the Gulf of St. Lawrence and by rivers in Maine, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick is being studied to quantify and characterize optical proxies in the receiving waters of the Gulf of Maine (GoM). Measurements of DOC concentrations, absorption coefficients (254nm, 350 nm and 412 nm), specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA254), spectral slope, and fluorescence, and DOC fractionation and isotopic analyses were used to determine the amount and nature of DOM from major inflowing rivers, marine waters, and the GoM. In addition, lignin phenols, 14C-age, 13C-NMR and FTICR-MS analyses were performed on the hydrophobic (HPOA) and transphilic organic acid fractions of the DOM isolated using XAD resins for a smaller subset of samples from the Penobscot River, Penobscot Bay, GoM waters in the Eastern Maine Coastal Current (EMCC), a sample from the eastern portion of the GoM (Scotian Shelf waters), and the Pacific Ocean. These samples provide detailed DOM compositional data in support of the more easily collected concentration and optical data obtained from discrete samples, optical data obtained by in situ glider, and remotely sensed satellite observations. Optical measurements, 13C-NMR, and lignin phenol analyses showed that DOM associated with inflowing rivers to the GoM is rich in aromatic compounds resulting in a large flux of terrestrially derived chromophoric DOM (CDOM). As a result, GoM DOM is more aromatic and younger than open ocean samples collected from the Sargasso Sea and from the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii. This observation is consistent with isotopic data that indicated δ 13C values for the HPOA fractions from the Gulf samples (δ 13C= -27‰ and -25‰) were considerably depleted in comparison to the whole DOM sample (δ 13C = -19‰; which also includes algal-produced DOM) and are more similar to those from the terrestrial sources. Samples from the EMCC were the most heavily influenced by terrestrial sources. While NMR analyses indicated decreases in the aromaticity of the HPOA fractions moving from the rivers to the open ocean, NMR signals associated with carboxyl-rich alicyclic organic matter were observed for all samples. Results from this study are being used to develop relationships for predicting DOC concentration in the GoM from remotely sensed, satellite optical data.",

Heavily instrumented aircraft, including the NASA DC-8 sampled a wide variety of aerosol types including transported Saharan dust, both fresh and aged smoke from western wildfires, urban pollution plumes and also biogenic aerosol produced by the “green volcano” in the vegetated Ozarks. Complementing these aircraft measurements was an enhanced array of AERONET stations sprinkled across the country and also concentrated in a mesoscale array near the home base of Houston Texas. This rich collection of suborbital aerosol information permits a more comprehensive evaluation of the VIIRS aerosol product that includes validation of the products across the mesoscale and choices of case studies in which we can delve deeper into the VIIRS retrieval to test algorithm assumptions. We will compare VIIRS retrievals during SEAC4RS with MODIS retrievals, with AERONET observations and retrievals, and with measurements and retrievals from the Polar Imaging Nephelometer (PI-Neph) that flew aboard the NASA DC-8.",

Involving scientists as subject-matter experts in professional development modules designed to address the NGSS standards can greatly improve instructor understanding of the necessary material. \nResults from extant teacher development workshops developed by the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere at Colorado State University, using the Colorado fifth-grade state standards for weather and climate (which are materially similar to the NGSS standards), are demonstrated, focusing on knowledge transfer and follow-up with educators. Efforts to maintain contact and continue scientist-instructor relationship post-workshop are detailed, as well as challenges faced implementing workshops. Possible best-practices guidelines that would extend to other fields of research germane to NGSS standards are discussed as well.",

            "abstract": "A key mechanism of dynamic coupling between the upper thermosphere and topside ionosphere is the resonant charge exchange between its major constituents: ionized and neutral atomic hydrogen and oxygen. As the dominant chemical source and sink for protons in particular, deviations from charge exchange equilibrium are associated with neutral composition changes as well as vertical plasma flows, both diurnally and in response to sporadic, storm-driven disturbances. The precise light ion partitioning by the incoherent scatter radar (ISR) at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico enables empirical quantification of this charge exchange coupling in terms of neutral O and H density, such that specification of one neutral species allows estimation of the other. Unfortunately, the historical lack of reliable quantification of either species' density has limited the routine application of this technique until now. Recent success in deriving precise estimates of H density throughout the thermosphere, based on measurements of its Lyman alpha airglow emission acquired by the Global Ultraviolet Imager (GUVI) onboard NASA's TIMED satellite, finally enables unprecedented time-dependent quantification of the neutral O density distribution in the upper thermosphere from the sensitive Arecibo ISR measurements of ion-neutral coupling. In this work, I will describe these recent advances in measurement capability and present initial results which reveal its powerful implications for advancing understanding of thermosphere composition variability.",

            "abstract": "Identifying spatiotemporal influences on soil microbial community (SMC) structure is critical to understanding of patterns in nutrient cycling and related ecological services. Since forest canopy structure alters the spatiotemporal patterning of precipitation water and solute supplies to soils (via the “throughfall” mechanism), is it possible changes in SMC structure variability could arise from modifications in canopy elements? Our study investigates this question by monitoring throughfall water and dissolved ion supply to soils beneath a continuum of canopy structure: from a large gap (0% cover) to heavy Tillandsia usneoides L. (Spanish moss) canopy (>90% cover). Throughfall water supply diminished with increasing canopy cover, yet increased washoff/leaching of Na+, Cl-, PO43-, and SO42- from the canopy to the soils (p < 0.01). Presence of T. usneoides diminished throughfall NO3-, but enhanced NH4+, concentrations supplied to subcanopy soils. The mineral soil horizon (0-10 cm) from canopy gaps, bare canopy, and T. usneoides-laden canopy significantly differed (p < 0.05) in soil chemistry parameters (pH, Ca2+, Mg2+, CEC). PCR-DGGE banding patterns beneath similar canopy covers (experiencing similar throughfall dynamics) also produced high similarities per ANalyses Of SIMilarity (ANO-SIM), and clustered together when analyzed by Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS). Correlation analysis of DGGE banding patterns, throughfall dynamics, and soil chemistry yielded significant correlations (p < 0.05) between fungal communities and soil chemical properties significantly differing between canopy cover types (pH: r2 = 0.50; H+ %-base saturation: r2 = 0.48; Ca2+ %-base saturation: r2 = 0.43). Bacterial community structure correlated with throughfall NO3-, NH4+, and Ca2+ concentrations (r2 = 0.37, p = 0.16). These results suggest that modifications of forest canopy structures are capable of affecting mineral-soil horizon SMC structure via the throughfall mechanism when canopies’ biomass distribution is highly heterogeneous.",

            "abstract": "Asymmetric spreading is common at slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges when an active detachment fault accommodates a portion of the total plate separation. Basalts erupted along asymmetric segments have lower Ca, higher Fe, Na, K than the ones collected from symmetric segments, indicating higher pressures of fractionation and lower extents of partial melting of the mantle [Langmuir et al., AGU, 2013]. Seismic evidence also shows a thicker and colder axial lithosphere at asymmetric sections of the ridge [Escartín et al., 2008]. This phenomenon is most obvious when the asymmetric spreading centers are also oblique to its opening direction. The reduced melt supply beneath asymmetric spreading segments may be attributed to distorted mantle upwelling, enhanced hydrothermal cooling, and enriched compositional heterogeneities in the upper mantle.\nWe construct two-dimensional thermo-mechanical models of symmetric and asymmetric spreading centers, and test the effects of asymmetric accretion and hydrothermal circulation on mantle melting. A temperature-dependent mantle viscosity is used. The hydrothermal circulation is implemented as an enhanced thermal conductivity limited by cutoff depth and temperature. The effect of oblique spreading is incorporated in the model as reduced effective spreading rate. Mantle flow and thermal structure are solved in the commercial finite element software COMSOL Multiphysics®. Melt production and flux are estimated in Matlab® using a nonlinear melting function [Katz et al., 2003]. We show that the asymmetric accretion alone does not affect the extent of melting or reduce the melt flux significantly. Hydrothermal cooling can plays an important role in deepening the melting depth and lowering the melt extent. Therefore, the difference in the extent of melting between asymmetric and symmetric spreading models can be explained by an enhanced hydrothermal circulation at asymmetric segments. This correlation is supported by the observation made at Mid-Atlantic Ridge that hydrothermal activities are closely associated with asymmetric segments. In addition, Lavier and Buck [2002] showed that efficient cooling of the lithosphere favors the development of large offset detachments and therefore asymmetric spreading.",

            "abstract": "The earliest signals of a climate change are being observed in the Arctic where warming has been amplified primarily on account of ice-albedo feedbacks associated with the high reflectivity of snow and ice. Because of general inaccessibility, there is a paucity of in situ data and hence the need to use satellite data to observe the large-scale variability and trends in surface temperature in the region. The sensor with the longest record has been the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) that has provided continuous thermal infrared data since 1981. The primary source of error in the data is cloud masking because of similar signatures of clouds and snow/ice covered surfaces. The temperatures derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer from 2000 to the present were used as the baseline for the study and to enhance the AVHRR data. SSTs from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer were also used for assessments of accuracy and short term variability in ice free ocean regions. These three data sets were used in conjunction with meteorological station data to quantify changes in surface temperature over the pan-Arctic region. Our results show an average warming rate of 0.6°C per decade in the Arctic (>64 °N) from 1981 to 2013 which is 3 times that of about 0.2°C per decade globally for the same period which in turn is more than 2 times the global warming rate from 1900 to 2013. The spatial distribution of warming is, however, not uniform with the trends varying from around 0.2oC/decade in Eurasia to about 0.7oC/decade in Greenland. Some regions of the Arctic such as Siberia and the Bering Sea show moderate cooling but caused in part by anomalously warm values in these regions in the 1980s. Also, the average SST in the Arctic basin is observed to be increasing and is highly correlated to changes in the sea ice cover.",

Tidal flexing “samples” this microstructure; the microstructure's anelastic (attenuation, Q–1) response effects dissipation. Experiments combining steady-state creep of polycrystalline ice-I with superposed sinusoidal loading demonstrated an attenuation response that is (a) an order of magnitude more attenuating than predicted by the Maxwell Solid model, (b) similar in form to the Andrade Solid model, which at high-temperature and/or low-frequency conditions is approximated by a power law, (c) modestly non-linear (i.e., Q–1 is a function of the periodic strain amplitude) and (d) insensitive to grain size [1]. The grain-size insensitivity is profound, as steady-state creep of the specimens occurred by the geologically relevant mechanism of grain boundary sliding accommodated by basal dislocation glide (GBS)—a grain-size-sensitive rheology [2]. Here GBS involves emission, motion and interaction of lattice dislocations, and dislocation structures (e.g., subgrain boundaries and secondary grain boundary dislocations) are part of the microstructure sampled by the periodic stress.\n Transient creep responses sample the aspects of creep microstructure that effect attenuation. In our experiments, polycrystalline ice-I specimens are crept to steady state in the GBS regime (σ = 0.5-5.0 MPa, T = 243K, d = 30-150µm) and subjected to instantaneous drops in differential stress: initial strain-rate recovery is related to the creep microstructure of the previous, higher stress. Our results map-out in stress-strain rate space a “hardness” curve consistent with dislocation microstructure self-similarity - a requirement for grain size-insensitive attenuation. Cryogenic electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) characterizes the associated microstructure. We have not observed significant subgrain development in our samples; the result suggests a first-order role for the grain boundary dislocation structure proper [cf. 3].\n[1] C.

            "abstract": "The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model has been used for predicting rainfall over the Philippines. The period of October 2013 to May 2014 is chosen for the evaluation because of the unprecedented number of new ground instruments (300 to 500 automated rain gauges). It also gives us a good statistical representation of wet and dry seasons in the country. The WRF model configuration makes use of NCEP FNL for the initial boundary condition. Hindcasts are produced at 12-km resolution with 12 hours up to 144 hours lead-time. To assess the predictability of rainfall, we look at the dichotomous case, wherein we evaluate if the model is able to predict correctly the number of rainfall events. The left column in Figure 1 shows the monthly Percent Correct and Critical Success Index (CSI) for different lead-time. Percent Correct represents how well the model performs, 1 being the highest score, with equal bearing on correct positives and correct negatives. On the other hand, CSI is a balanced score that accounts for false alarm and missed events – it has a range of 0 to 1, where 1 means perfect forecast. Results show that during the wet season (October, November and December), PC is approximately 0.7 while in dry season (January, February and March), PC reaches values of around 0.9, which suggests improvement in the performance from wet to dry season. The increase in performance is attributed to the increase in number of correct negatives during the dry season. The CSI score, which excludes the correct negatives, shows that the ability of WRF to predict rainfall events drastically decline in December or during the transition from wet to dry season. This is due to the inability of WRF to pinpoint exact locations of small convective rainfall events. The predictability of actual rainfall values is indicated by the Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) and Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) in Figure 1. The MAE for 3-hour accumulated rainfall is smallest during the dry season.",

            "abstract": "Mineralogical and geochemical conditions vary significantly in natural water systems, including groundwater aquifers and rivers. In addition, contamination events are often elusive. As a result, it is often challenging to pinpoint the contamination of natural waters by specific types of water sources. The strontium isotope ratio R87Sr, defined as 87Sr/86Sr, has shown promise in discerning contamination from different types of wastewaters related to Marcellus Shale development. The R87Sr of potential end members, including Marcellus shale produced water (0.710-0.712) and Upper Devonian/Lower Mississippian formation brine (0.720-0.721), have been shown to be distinct from those in natural waters. Here we use reactive transport modeling (CrunchFlow) to understand key process and factors that govern the evolution of R87Sr, and the conditions under which we can discern contamination sources in natural water systems. Simulation results show that ion exchange reaction plays an important role in the evolution of R87Sr while release rate has a relatively minor impact on R87Sr evolution. Even with large dilution factor where the volumetric flow rate of natural waters is orders of magnitude higher than the release rates of contamination source water, the R87Sr is still sensitive to different types of source contamination waters. Insights gained here suggest that strontium isotopes can potentially be used as a tracers for different type of water contamination. The modeling tool developed can offer a powerful tool for understanding, predicting, monitoring of natural water contamination.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that the polar cap convection pattern is highly dependent on the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and its radius depends significantly on geomagnetic activity. In contrast, the midlatitude fall-off of the high latitude electric field is relatively less understood. This region connects the high latitude polar cap convection to the region where the ring currents cancel out the low latitude electric field. The electric field in this midlatitude region is typically modeled as a simple fall-off, but magnetosphere-ionosphere dynamics may create structure in this region that has previously been neglected by ionospheric models. We investigate the IMF and Kp dependencies and the fall-off using plasma drift data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) and a simplified polar cap convection model. The model uses an inverse fourth power function to approximate the fall-off and incorporates two offsets (one dusk to dawn and one noon to midnight) and a potential skew to replicate the convection pattern. First the northern hemisphere polar cap passes from DMSP were separated into categories based on IMF clock angle and magnitude. Two methods were used to account for the delay from the time of the IMF measurement by the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) satellite to the time the plasma reaches earth. The first method uses a standardized delay value based on a typical solar wind speed while the second method used actual solar wind measurements from ACE to calculate the time delay. The groupings obtained using these two methods will be compared to determine if they produce significantly different results. The groupings will also be compared to the model results to determine what offsets are required to match the IMF orientation. Groupings based on geomagnetic activity using the Kp index will then be examined and compared to the model fall-off at midlatitudes. We will discuss the differences in the time delay methods and the results of the IMF orientation and Kp grouping comparison to the model.",

            "abstract": "This study presents the discovery of two sets of Archean fossil microorganisms (microfossils) and describes how such a study can be an analogue for a potential Martian sample return mission like that proposed as a follow up to the Mars 2020 mission. Microfossils are not easily preserved and their simple morphologies (made less distinct by taphonomy and diagenesis) can be confused with nonbiological structures. Thus, several lines of evidence are required for a biological interpretation of such remains. Despite this limitation, microfossils represent the most direct and easily illustrated evidence of life, and this will also be true of any microfossils that might be found on Mars. Martian sample return will provide the first chance to apply a full suite of analytical techniques to the study of possible Martian microfossils. Because such precious samples would be of limited quantity, this suite must include nondestructive techniques that are performed in situ and at a micron-scale.\nThe samples studied here were collected from two chert units within the Gamohaan Formation of the Kaapvaal Craton of South Africa. One set was collected from the Tsineng Member near the top of the formation and contains fossils of mat-forming filamentous microorganisms (~15–20 µm in diameter) that were buried in place. The other set comes from a chert bed stratigraphically lower within the Gamohaan Formation. This bed contains shriveled and somewhat compacted spherical microfossils (~100 µm in diameter) and are interpreted to be the remains of planktonic forms that settled from above. Cherts were collected based on a visual identification of their likelihood to contain microfossils. Optical microscopy was used to locate microstructures of interest within thin sections. The biological nature of these structures is supported by analyses of their three dimensional morphologies by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) as well as their carbonaceous compositions by Raman spectroscopy. Raman and CLSM are nondestructive techniques that can be used to analyze specimens within rock to the depth of several tens of microns with no special sample preparation. Also, because Raman and CLSM can be used to study modern microorganisms, they are ideal techniques for the study of returned Martian samples that could contain either fossil or living material.",

            "abstract": "We found that internal variability is a substantial source of uncertainty for local climatological precipitation in an ensemble of perturbed physics experiments (PPE) in which we also perturbed the atmospheric initial conditions. The ensemble consists of about seventy 50-year long AMIP simulations performed with the GFDL model at 1x1 degree resolution.\nOur goal is to describe the dependence of the local precipitation climatology to the value of each parameter being perturbed in the ensemble; and we found that a quadratic dependence is appropriate for the entrainment in convective clouds (Fig.1a) with the quadratic term acting to compensate the effect of the linear term: the magnitude of the latter is in fact 20-30% larger and of opposite sign in all major convective areas in the Tropics. About 50% of the grid points show such behavior (Fig.1b) when an ensemble of initial conditions is employed.\nTo assess the impact of internal variability we repeated the analysis using only one run for each parameter value and found that the confidence with which the fitting parameters are established is strongly decreased: a difference in the magnitude of the reconstructed precipitation of about 10-30% is obtained, when precipitation is evaluated at the standard value of the entrainment coefficient (Fig.1c); and the number of grid points in which the null hypothesis of “no quadratic dependence” is rejected halves (Fig.1d).\nPreliminary results on the joint impact of internal variability and temporal span of the simulations indicate that an increased uncertainty of about 10% occurs when only 20 of the 50 years of simulations are considered.\nLastly, in exploring model optimization we found that a PPE often cannot be discerned from the internal variability in a simulation length of 50 years.",

            "abstract": "Amazon basin during the wet season is one of the few places on Earth where “natural atmosphere”, as it is expected to be in pre-industrial era, can be observed. Atmosphere in clean Amazonia can be regarded as a baseline state of tropical atmosphere. Its hydrological cycle is extreme active, as well as its convection. Several scientific questions with respect to convection remain unclear. Diurnal cycle of convection is far from adequately represented in numeric models. Precipitation typically occurs in models in the first few hours in the morning, whereas actual rain occurs mostly in the early afternoon. Convection parameterizations lack the ability to represent it adequately due to the models coarse resolution of parameterizations compared to the spatial scale of shallow convection. An adequate comprehension of shallow to deep convection transition is critical to improve convection representation in models. To reach this goal, long term measurements that could characterize clouds and convection diurnal cycle are fundamental. The implementation of ACONVEX (Atmospheric CONVection EXperiment) site, situated 50 km upwind from the megacity of Manaus ( -2.894263S°, -59.971452W) aims to fill the existent gap in long term measurements. It is designed to make measurements for more than 10 yrs, and characterize cloud properties in a climatological perspective. The site started its operation in August, 2011, initially with the Raman Lidar. Present time instrumentation set comprises: 1) UV Lidar Raman, 2) CIMEL Sunphotometer, 3) MultiFilter shadow band Radiometer (MFR), 4) GNSS/GPS Receiver, 5) Vertical Pointing Radar, 6) Disdrometer, 7) Ceilometer, 8) Met station. Two sky imagers and a microwave radiometer are about to be operated and will be able to derive 1) Cloud Cover, 2) Cloud Top and Cloud Base Heights, 3) Liquid Water Content, 4) Integrated Precipitable Water, 5) PBL Height, 6) Rain Rate (vertical profile and at surface).

            "abstract": "This research aims to explore the interactions between the bed surface texture, the bed topography and the sediment transport (rate and grain size distribution) to a series of water pulses in gravel bed-rivers. We conducted a set of runs in a 18 m-long tilting flume, 1 m-wide. Low flow discharges (Q = 65 l/s) during periods of variable duration (between t = 10 h and t = 1 h) were alternated with high flow rates (Q = 90 l/s) of constant duration (t = 1.5 h). Sediment was fed at a constant rate (Qfeed = 7.5 kg/h) throughout the runs. Eight experiments were consecutively conducted: the final configuration of the previous run was the initial condition for the subsequent experiment. The initial bed texture of the experiments was obtained after a 280 h-long run at low flow, the last 40 h of which under starving conditions. The initial bed slope was S0 = 0.022 m/m. A poorly-sorted grain size distribution (Dg = 5.65 mm and sg = 3.05) was used as a feeding material. The same material was used as the initial condition for the antecedent experiment (280 h-long). Intensive measurements of the bed surface, bed topography and sediment transport were taken during the runs.\nProvisional results of the experimental campaign demonstrate that: (i) bed topography rapidly adjusts to water pulses: bed aggrades during low flow periods to subsequently degrade during water pulses. However, the rate of change of the bed profile decreases with the number of water pulses; (ii) the surface texture maintains an approximately invariant texture during the runs with no significant changes before and after the pulses; (iii) bedload transport dramatically adjusts to water pulses (increasing its rate and getting coarser). The relative increase in the bedload transport during the pulses diminishes as the number of pulses increases. A detailed analysis of the evolution of the bed profile shows the formation of transverse ribs during low flow periods which slowly migrate upstream. These bedforms are not vanished during the water pulses. On the contrary, their amplitude increases during pulses and decreases during low flow periods. The experiments also show that the bed surface locally adjusts to allow a rapid increase in the bedload transport rate while keeping an overall constant grain size distribution.",

This is even more evident, when we have to teach natural-hazards scientific aspects and safe attitudes toward risk.\nWe often see that most of the high-school students (16 -18 years old) are not motivated for extra-curricular activities implying science and/or behaviours changes. But, they have a very positive response when we give them some responsibility. On top of that, we also realised that young children are quite receptive to the involvement of older students in the school environment\nTaking this into consideration, our project use the k12 students to prepare scientific activities and subjects, based in questions, which they need to answer themselves. The students need to answer those questions and, only then, adapt and teach the right answers to the different school-levels.\nWith this approach, we challenged the students to solve three questions: How to use a SEP seismometer at school, and its data? How to set up a shaking table? How to introduce waves and vibrations contents to all ages of students?\nDuring the project they developed many science skills, and worked in straight cooperation with teachers, the parents association and the seismology research group at Instituto Dom Luíz.\nAs a result, it was possible to reach all school students with the help of the k-12 ones.\nThis is an outcome of the project W-Shake, a Parents-in-Science Initiative to promote the study of seismology and related subjects.

            "abstract": "This work presents a methodology for constructing 2D estimates of CO2 field concentrations from integrated open path measurements of CO2 concentrations. It provides a description of the methodology, an assessment based on simulated data and results from preliminary field trials. The Greenhouse gas Laser Imaging Tomography Experiment (GreenLITE) system, currently under development by Exelis and AER, consists of a set of laser-based transceivers and a number of retro-reflectors coupled with a cloud-based compute environment to enable real-time monitoring of integrated CO2 path concentrations, and provides 2D maps of estimated concentrations over an extended area of interest.\nThe GreenLITE transceiver-reflector pairs provide laser absorption spectroscopy (LAS) measurements of differential absorption due to CO2 along intersecting chords within the field of interest. These differential absorption values for the intersecting chords of horizontal path are not only used to construct estimated values of integrated concentration, but also employed in an optimal estimation technique to derive 2D maps of underlying concentration fields. This optimal estimation technique combines these sparse data with in situ measurements of wind speed/direction and an analytic plume model to provide tomographic-like reconstruction of the field of interest. This work provides an assessment of this reconstruction method and preliminary results from the Fall 2014 testing at the Zero Emissions Research and Technology (ZERT) site in Bozeman, Montana.\nThis work is funded in part under the GreenLITE program developed under a cooperative agreement between Exelis and the National Energy and Technology Laboratory (NETL) under the Department of Energy (DOE), contract # DE-FE0012574.

            "abstract": "Several key processes in the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) of the Arctic Ocean are related to the size of the ice floes, whose diameters range from meters to tens of kilometers. The floe size distribution (FSD) influences the mechanical properties of the ice cover, air-sea momentum and heat transfer, lateral melting, and light penetration. However, no existing sea-ice/ocean models currently simulate the FSD in the MIZ.\nModel development depends on observations of the FSD for parameterization, calibration, and validation. To support the development and implementation of the FSD in the Marginal Ice Zone Modeling and Assimilation System (MIZMAS), we have analyzed the FSD in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas using multiple sources of satellite imagery: NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra and Aqua satellites (250 m pixel size), the USGS Landsat 8 satellite (80 m pixel size), the Canadian Space Agency’s synthetic aperture radar (SAR) on RADARSAT (50 meter pixel size), and declassified National Technical Means imagery from the Global Fiducials Library (GFL) of the USGS (1 m pixel size).\nThe procedure for identifying ice floes in the imagery begins with manually delineating cloud-free regions (if necessary). A threshold is then chosen to separate ice from water. Morphological operations and other semi-automated techniques are used to identify individual floes, whose properties are then easily calculated. We use the mean caliper diameter as the measure of floe size.\nThe FSD is adequately described by a power-law in which the exponent characterizes the relative number of large and small floes. Changes in the exponent over time and space reflect changes in physical processes in the MIZ, such as sea-ice deformation, fracturing, and melting. We report results of FSD analysis for the spring and summer of 2013 and 2014, and show how the FSD will be incorporated into the MIZMAS model.",

We tested and applied the use of miniature data loggers to acquire novel Temperature (T) and water content (weight percent, wt%) of fine-grained sediments deposited during rain events at Ubehebe Crater (UC), the larger and deeper crater within a volcanic field in Death Valley. The Miniaturized in situ systems are compliant with Death Valley National Park’s regulations to conduct scientific research in wilderness and sacred sites.\n About 130,000 hours of recorded soil moisture and temperature were acquired in relation to the hydroclimatic conditions (2009-current). Total annual rainfall in the area range from ~50mm to <250 mm/y in water years (WY) 2004-to date. These values are representative of the climatic context of the Mojave Region as they encompass the wettest (2005, 2011) and driest years (2002, 2007, 2012, 2013, 2014) of the last ~120 years (Western Regional Climate Center, www.wrcc.dri.edu). To date, surface (0.5 cm to 2 cm-depth) moisture of intra-crater deposits can vary from dry-very dry (1-3wt % to - 10 wt%) to wet-saturated (10-60 wt%). Over saturated conditions occur in ephemeral ponds, which appear to form once a year as a result of winter and summer rainstorms, and may last for one-two weeks (2009-2014 study years).\nSummer storms can yield ca. 40% to 60% of the total annual precipitation (WY 2011 thru 2014). The intensity and temporal distribution of annual storms together with ground temperature extremes (-16 to +67 ºC) influence moisture distribution and retention within the crater’s floor.",

Plumes are often observed to grow in asymmetric patterns facilitated by highly conductive pathways. The observed variance is profound even in cases with negligible molecular diffusion (either longitudinally along the fracture segments or between the fractures and rock matrix). A DFN framework with steady-state flow fields are used to track particles through two-dimensional stochastic fracture networks with realistic statistical attributes. Separation statistics between particle pairs are utilized to characterize plume growth and scaling behavior under different transport regimes. These transport regimes, in turn, are then linked to quantitative properties of the fracture network, mainly distributions of fracture length and transmissivity.",

            "abstract": "Meridional circulation plays an important role ingoverning cycle period and memory of solar dynamo models.Accurate knowledge of time variation in flow speed andprofile is crucial for estimating a solar cycle's amplitude,timing, rise and fall patterns and north-south asymmetry,which are ultimately responsible for causing space climatevariation. However, no consensus has been reached yet aboutthe Sun's meridional circulation pattern from observationsand theories. Therefore, it is necessary to implement dataassimilation approaches, in addition to observations andmodels, to investigate solar interior flow properties. Wepresent here first results from a sequential dataassimilation into a Babcock-Leighton flux-transport solardynamo model to reconstruct time-varying meridionalcirculation speed. We perform several observation systemsimulation experiments (OSSE) by implementing an EnsembleKalman Filter (EnKF) in the framework of the Data AssimilationResearch Testbed (DART). We find that the best reconstructionof time-variation in meridional flow-speed can be obtainedwhen ten or more observations are used with an updatingtime of 15 days and a 10% observational error. Increasingensemble-size from 16 to 160 improves reconstruction, buteven larger ensembles do not lead to further improvement.Comparison of reconstructed flow-speed with \"true-state\"reveals that EnKF data assimilation is very powerful forreconstructing meridional flow-speeds and suggests that it can be implemented for reconstructing spatio-temporal patterns of meridional circulation.

            "abstract": "The first comprehensive insights of the aerosol first indirect effects (FIE) in southeastern China were examined based on the ground-based measurements during the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Mobile Facility (AMF) campaign in Shouxian (SX) from May to December 2008. During our study period, aerosol burden is larger in summer (JJA) and during the morning period (AM) than in autumn (SON) and during the afternoon period (PM). More clouds with the larger COD and LWP in SON and AM than those in JJA and PM, with the larger cloud droplet radius (DER) in SON and PM than those in JJA and AM. Generally, obviously opposite relationship between the mean aerosol loading proxies (aerosol scattering coefficient (σs), horizontal visibility), and DER were detected. High aerosol loading leads to a shift in the probability distribution functions of DER toward smaller values and results in the narrow distribution of DER. For whole period, the value of FIE is 0.15 and 0.09 for the clouds with LWP ranging from 75-100 g m-2 and 125-150 g m-2, respectively, which indicated that the disturbance of aerosol on cloud significantly weaken with the LWP increasing. There is no significant difference in FIE estimation between AM and PM, while the FIE is generally larger in SON than that in JJA. The FIE estimated based on the cloud condensation nuclei concentration is larger than that based on the optical-related aerosol properties, such as σs and scattering wavelength index. Use of the σs alone, without aerosol size information, tends to underestimate the magnitude of FIE than use of the combination of σs and size information. Compared with the result from surface measurements, the effects of aerosol on cloud microphysical properties estimated from MODIS are weaker and affected by much more noises, implying that the studies of aerosol indirect effect based on the satellite measurements may induce large uncertainties due to some inherent insufficient.",

            "abstract": "We are performing calculations of the formation of Jupiter via core nucleated accretion and gas capture. The calculations model the growth of a solid core from an evolving disk of planetesimals and the growth of a contracting gaseous envelope. We present results of the early phases of formation. The evolution of the solids accounts for growth and fragmentation, viscous and gravitational stirring, and for drag-assisted migration and velocity damping operated by the disk's gas. The envelope structure accounts for mass and energy deposition due to the ablation of planetesimals that move through the envelope. The envelope’s opacity takes into account coagulation and sedimentation of dust particles released by ablating planetesimals. The core starts as a seed body of 350 km in radius, orbiting at 5.2 AU in a disk of planetesimals whose initial radii range from 15 m to 50 km. The initial surface density of the solids is 10 g/cm^2 at the seed’s location. During the evolution of the solids, most of the mass resides in bodies of several tens of km in radius. These are also the planetesimals that provide most of the solids accretion to the planet. By comparing results with a calculation that does not account for the envelope bound to the core, we find that the size-dependent cross-section of the planet for the accretion of planetesimals is substantially enhanced by a low-mass, but voluminous envelope. The calculation without the envelope produces a core of 4.4 Earth masses (Mearth) after about 1 Myr, and an extrapolated mass of about 5 Mearth after 6 Myr. The full calculation with envelope yields a core of 7.3 Mearth and an envelope of 0.15 Mearth after about 0.4 Myr. At this point of the planet's evolution, the envelope accretion rate exceeds that of the core. Over the following 1 Myr, the core mass reaches about 8 Mearth and the envelope mass grows to about 4 Mearth. Support from NASA Outer Planets Research Program is gratefully acknowledged.",

            "abstract": "The oxygen and silicon isotope compositions of phytolith silica preserved in soils can be used to examine past climate and biogeochemical cycles. The δ18O values of phytoliths vary with temperature and the δ18O values of formation water while the δ30Si values of phytoliths depend on silicon availability and weathering rates. However, further investigation into the stability of opal-A phytoliths in soils is necessary, as post-depositional alteration of biogenic silica may alter the isotopic composition and affect paleoenvironmental reconstruction.\nThe effects of partial dissolution on the oxygen- and silicon-isotope composition of phytoliths was assessed through dissolution experiments in silicic acid-free water at a range of temperature (4-44°C) and pH conditions (4–10). After 3-30% dissolution, concurrent oxygen and silicon isotope analyses were obtained for the remaining opal-A. Over the course of the experiments oxygen and silicon isotope values of solid silica changed by up to +4.4 ‰ and +0.55 ‰, respectively. Under most conditions δ30Si values increased during early dissolution, followed by a decrease as dissolution progressed until δ30Si values were similar to, or in extreme cases, lower than the original unaltered phytoliths. This might indicate that both dissolution and re-precipitation contribute to the isotopic composition of the altered phytoliths. Changes in δ18O values of the phytoliths follow a similar pattern. We propose that the outer, reactive surface of a fresh phytolith is depleted of 30Si and 18O relative to the rest of the sample. A decrease in surface area suggests that removal of this layer accounts for the initial increase in δ30Si and δ18O values during early dissolution. Extended reaction times result in lower isotopic values and an unexpected decease in aqueous Si suggesting precipitation or exchange occurs.\nThis study improves our understanding of the role of terrestrial biogenic silica in global Si cycle. Post-depositional change in the isotopic composition of phytoliths complicates paleoclimate models but does not preclude their use if the isotopic alteration of the surface layer can be accounted for, or the altered surface layer can be removed prior to analyses. Like diatoms, phytoliths preserved in sediments likely have already lost their reactive surface layer.",

In this study we investigated changes in phenology and GPP of open oak savanna and annual grassland in California during 2000-2013. Two CO2 eddy flux tower sites (Tonzi Ranch and Raira Ranch), located in the lower foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California, were selected in this study, representing open oak savanna and annual grassland under the Mediterranean climate. Three vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI and LSWI) derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were evaluated for their biophysical performance to (1) delineate phenological dynamics (e.g., starting and ending dates of plant growing season) during 2000-2013 and (2) influence GPP dynamics of these two sites, based on field data in 2001-2007. The Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM) was also run to simulate GPP, driven by MODIS-based vegetation indices (EVI and LSWI) and NCEP/NARR climate data (air temperature and radiation). The resultant GPP estimates (GPPvpm) were compared with estimated GPP from the flux tower sites (GPPec) in 2001-2007. Furthermore, to evaluate sensitivity of VPM to climate data, we also ran the model with (1) in-situ climate data (temperature and radiation) from the flux tower in 2001-2007, and (2) temperature data from MODIS land surface temperature (LST) and radiation data from NCEP/NARR. The results show that VPM predicts reasonably well the seasonal dynamics and interannual variation of GPP of open oak savanna and annual grassland under various climate conditions (e.g., wet, normal and drought years). This synthesis study clearly demonstrates that integrating long-term CO2 eddy flux tower site data and satellite images will improve our understanding of the sensitivity of phenology and GPP to climate, soil moisture and vegetation over time.",

We present mission concepts relevant to NASA’s Cislunar Proving Ground and the Global Exploration Roadmap (GER).\nAsteroid Redirect Mission (ARM): ARM in part is a mission to the lunar vicinity. The ARM mission requirements result in system design based on a modified version of our 702 spacecraft. Including a NASA Docking System (NDS) on the Asteroid Redirect Vehicle allows for easier crewed exploration integration and execution.\nExploration Augmentation Module (EAM): Crew operations at a redirected asteroid could be significantly enhanced by providing additional systems and EVA capabilities beyond those available from the Orion only. An EAM located with the asteroid would improve the science and technical return of the asteroid mission while also increasing Orion capability through resource provision and providing an abort location and safe haven for contingencies. The EAM could be repurposed as a cislunar exploration platform that advances scientific research, enables lunar surface exploration and provides a deep space vehicle assembly and servicing site. International Space Station (ISS) industry partners have been working for the past several years on concepts for using ISS development methods and assets to support a broad range of missions. These concepts have matured along with planning details for NASA’s SLS and Orion for a platform located in the Earth-Moon Libration (EML) system or Distant Retrograde Orbit (DRO).\nLunar Surface: The mission objectives are to provide lunar surface access for crew and cargo and to provide as much reuse as possible. Subsequent missions to the surface can reuse the same lander and Lunar Transfer Vehicle.\nMars Vicinity: The International space community has declared that our unified horizon goal is for a human mission to Mars. Translunar infrastructure and heavy lift capability are key to this approach. The moons of Mars would provide an excellent stepping stone to the surface. As a “shake-down” cruise before landing, a mission to Deimos or Phobos would test all of the systems except those needed to get to the surface and back. This test would provide confidence for the in-space transportations and crew habitat systems.",

CATE is a microgravity experiment to study low-velocity collisions between cm-sized particles and 0.1-1.0 mm-sized particles in vacuum to better understand the conditions for accretion in the protoplanetary disk as well as collisions in planetary ring systems. CATE flew on three parabolic airplane flights in July, 2014, using NASA’s “Weightless Wonder VI” aircraft. A significant part of the project was documenting the experience of designing, building, testing, and flying spaceflight hardware from the perspective of the undergraduates working on the experiment. The outreach effort was aimed at providing high schools students interested in STEM careers with a first-person view of hands-on student research at the university level. We also targeted undergraduates at the University of Central Florida to make them aware of space research on campus. The CATE team pursued multiple outlets, from social media to presentations at local schools, to connect with the public and with younger students. We created a website which hosted a blog, links to media publications that ran our story, videos, and galleries of images from work in the lab throughout the year. In addition the project had Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts. These social media outlets had much more traffic than the website except during the flight week when photos posted on the blog generated significant traffic. The most effective means of communicating the project to the target audience, however, was through face-to-face presentations in classrooms. We saw a large increase in followers on Twitter and Instagram as the flight campaign got closer and while we were there. The main source of followers came after we presented to local high school students. These presentations were made by the undergraduate student team and the faculty mentors (Colwell and Dove).",

            "abstract": "As comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, the Rosetta mission target, is approaching perihelion, the OSIRIS instrument observed the nucleus' very unique dumbbell-like shape recently. It arouses an interesting question as to what the coma will look like with the combination of the irregular shape and the rotation of the nucleus, as a result of solar radiation. A physics-based three dimensional coma model is highly desirable to study this topic. One candidate is Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, and it has been successfully applied to such problems. However, since the comet may be considerably active closer to perihelion and the gas near the nucleus is dense, the time step in DSMC model has to be tiny to accommodate the small mean free path and the high collision frequency, which can make time-variable DSMC modeling computationally expensive. In this work, we develop a multi-neutral-fluid model based on BATS-R-US in the University of Michigan's SWMF (Space Weather Modeling Framework), which can serve as a useful alternative to DSMC methods to compute the inner coma. This model treats cometary heavy neutrals, hydrogen atoms and dusts of different particle sizes as separate fluids. In the model, we include different momentum and energy transfer coefficients for different fluids, heating from chemical reactions and frictions between gas and dust. With other necessary physics considered, it is able to give us a more physical picture than one fluid model. The preliminary results are presented and discussed.

            "abstract": "Reliable and cost-efficient reservoir surveillance techniques play an important role in the context of geological carbon dioxide storage. Electrical methods are particularly suited to image the displacement of highly conductive formation fluids by a more resistive CO2 plume. At the Ketzin site close to Berlin, Germany, a permanent installation of 45 ring-shaped stainless steel electrodes distributed in an injection well and two observation wells is in operation since the start of injection in June 2008. The depth of the installation intervals in the three wells ranges from 590 m to 735 m. Based on our practical experience after more than five years of injection (until August 2013), we draw conclusions with regard to the usefulness and versatility of such an electrode array as well as associated challenges under the aspect of technical longevity.\nWith regard to future installations, we present an experimental design approach to estimate optimum electrode locations along the borehole trajectories with the objective to maximize the resolution within a prescribed target horizon. Our results show that a sparse but well-conceived set of electrodes with a refinement of the electrode spacing in the target region can provide a large portion of the information content offered by very dense electrode layouts. Using Ketzin as a case study for realistic CO2 plume migration, we compare the optimized layout to the existing equidistant installation at Ketzin with a focus on the offered resolution and the inversion performance. The presented results can assist practitioners in the design of reliable and cost-efficient monitoring systems for future underground storage sites.",

The development of MicroMAS motivates an architectural analysis of a constellation of nanosatellites with the goal of drastically reducing the cost of observing severe storms compared with current monolithic missions such as the Precision and All-Weather Temperature and Humidity (PATH) mission from the NASA Decadal Survey.\nOur goal is to evolve the instrument capability on weather monitoring nanosatellites to achieve higher performance and better satisfy stakeholder needs. Clear definitions of performance requirements are critical in the conceptual design phase when much of the project’s lifecycle cost and performance will be fixed. Ability to perform trade studies and optimization of performance needs with instrument capability will enable design teams to focus on key technologies that will introduce high value and high return on investment.\nIn this work, we approach the significant trades and trends of constellations for monitoring severe storms by applying our rule-based decision support tool. We examine a subset of stakeholder groups listed in the OSCAR online database (e.g., weather, climate) that would benefit from severe storm weather data and their respective observation requirements (e.g. spatial resolution, accuracy). We use ten parameters in our analysis, including atmospheric temperature, humidity, and precipitation. We compare the performance and cost of thousands of different possible constellations. The constellations support hyperspectral sounders that cover different portions of the millimeter-wave spectrum (50-60 GHz, 118GHz, 183GHz) in different orbits, and the performance results are compared against those of the monolithic PATH mission.\nOur preliminary results indicate that constellations using the hyperspectral millimeter wave sounders can better satisfy stakeholder needs compared to the PATH mission. Well-architected constellations have increased coverage, improved horizontal resolution from lower orbits, and improved temporal resolution. Furthermore, this improved performance can be achieved at a lower cost than what is estimated for the PATH mission.",

            "abstract": "Rising sea-level over the next century will reshape our coastlines and make low-lying islands more vulnerable to extreme events. Atolls could potentially provide unique geologic records from periods of high sea level analogous to those we might experience over the coming centuries. However, sea-level records from atolls have been largely overlooked, in part because the processes that shape coral reef and atoll form are often complex and, in many cases, remain unexplored. Darwin’s canonical model, which proposes an evolution from fringing reef to barrier reef to atoll as an ocean island ages and subsides, cannot explain the stratigraphy or morphology of many island reefs.\nWe will present a study that combines a numerical model of reef development with existing stratigraphic records from Pacific atolls. The model, driven by sea level, simulates the evolution of atoll morphology using parameterizations of coral growth, rim derived sediment and in situ production, dissolution, and subsidence. We use it to solve for late-Miocene to present sea level by iteratively changing the ice volume and deep-ocean temperature corrections for converting deep-ocean, benthic, δ18O to sea level and finding the best-fit between the model output and corelog stratigraphy from Enewetak Atoll. We then compare lagoon depths produced by the model for different island sizes and dissolution rates (but the same subsidence and sediment production rates) to an independent dataset of real-world observations from the Marshall, Gilbert and Caroline Island chains. Our model results suggest that a period of sustained low sea level occurred during the late Miocene before rising above present moving into the Pliocene. We propose that it was atoll exposure and enhanced lagoon dissolution during the subsequent sea-level fall since the late Pliocene, ~2.7 Ma – not crustal subsidence, as Darwin’s canonical model of atoll evolution presumes – that likely drove the development of modern rimmed atoll morphology.",

            "abstract": "Establishing records of past ice-sheet retreat provides a critical constraint in identifying sources of past sea-level rise while also providing insight into the possible responses of present-day ice sheets to a warming climate. Here we present 86 new 10Be cosmogenic exposure dates that constrain the final deglaciation of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet (SIS) during the latest Pleistocene and early Holocene. Our dates come from three transects spanning southern to northern Sweden and Finland. All transects begin around previously dated or inferred Younger Dryas ice margins and converge in northwestern Sweden, where ages suggest final deglaciation of the SIS at 10±0.3 ka. The individual transects reveal an asymmetric pattern for the deglaciation of the SIS, with near-instantaneous retreat occurring in southeastern Finland during the end of the Younger Dryas (ages range from 11.9±0.4 ka to 12.1±0.4 ka). Although not as rapid, deglaciation in northern Finland occurs during the later portion of the Younger Dryas (12.1±0.4 ka to 11.9±0.8 ka), with the majority of the retreat occurring in response to warming after the Younger Dryas. In southern Sweden, retreat during the Younger Dryas is much slower (~63 m/yr) than in Finland, but accelerates rapidly northward in response to warming out of the Younger Dryas (574 m/yr). As the ice margin retreated onto the Swedish highlands, retreat remains steady along transects at ~280 m/yr, before terminating at 10±0.3 ka. Combining this new chronology with existing ages constraining the deglaciation of the SIS from the Last Glacial Maximum position allows for a determination of SIS sensitivity to warming throughout the last deglaciation, while providing constraints on the SIS sea level rise contribution. When combined with recent constraints on Laurentide Ice Sheet retreat during the Holocene, we provide an estimate of residual sea-level rise as the difference between the combined SIS and LIS contributions and a new estimate of global mean sea-level rise.

Measurements were taken at the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing (ICLRT) in Camp Blanding, FL during the summer of 2014. The linear array was oriented in an end-fire position so that the peak acoustic reception pattern can be steered vertically along the channel with a frequency-dependent spatial resolution, enabling us to sample the acoustic signatures from different portions along the lightning channel. We report on the characteristics of acoustic signatures associated with several return strokes in 6 measured flashes (total of 29 return strokes). In addition, we study the relationship between the amplitude, peak frequency, and inferred energy input of each stroke acoustic signature and the associated measured lightning parameters. Furthermore, challenges of obtaining acoustic measurements in thunderstorm harsh conditions and their countermeasures will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The Mexico City Metropolitan Area is the largest urban center in the American continent, with 20.4 millions of inhabitants, representing 17.8% of the total population of the country. Over the past several decades Mexico City has been experienced rapid subsidence, up to ~370 mm/yr, caused by groundwater extraction. The subsidence rate is inhomogeneous, as it controlled by the local geology. Unconsolidated sediments tend to compact and induce rapid subsidence, whereas subsurface volcanic rocks are less prone to subsidence. Intensive faulting in the city has been observed in areas of differential deformation; in these areas buildings and infrastructure are highly damaged. Quantification of subsidence-induce damage is needed for establishing the magnitude of the phenomenon.\nOur study uses three data sources: a satellite-derived subsidence map, census information of population distribution for 2010, and information on buildings and infrastructure. The subsidence map was calculated from 29 SAR scene acquired by the Envisat satellite during the years 2003-2010 using the Persistent Scatterers Interferometry (PSI) method with the SqueeSAR algorithm. The information of the census of population comes from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI), which also provides the information about infrastructure. We intersected the information from the three maps using a geographic information system (GIS), which cover an area of 1, 640 km2. As subsidence-induced damage occurs mainly in areas of differential subsidence, we based the GIS analysis on the subsidence gradients, rather than subsidence rates. In order to evaluate subsidence-induced faulting risk, we generated a risk matrix that worked as the main parameter to create a risk map. We then reclassified the urban area into 5 zones according to the related risk, with R0 for the lowest risk and R4 for the highest. Our counting showed that 350 km2 of the city is located in an urban area of high to very high risk, which represents 21.7 % of the total area. These areas include ~5.8 millions of inhabitants, which are 34.5% of the total population in Mexico City.",

One such change in position on multi-decadal timescales occurred during the climate regime shift in 1976/1977. We investigate the spatial and temporal response of the SPCZ using stalagmite-based rainfall reconstructions from Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands that cover the last 500 years. The two stalagmite reconstructions contain significant multi-decadal variability centered near 50 years. We explore the source of the multi-decadal variability by evaluating the influence of karst processes, solar forcing, volcanic forcing and internal climate variability. We conclude that internal climate variability is the most likely source of the multi-decadal rainfall variability in the reconstructions. The two stalagmite rainfall reconstructions suggest a spatial heterogeneity to the past multi-decadal swings in the SPCZ that is more complex than that is observed during the instrumental period. We investigate this complex spatial response of the SPCZ by examining output from long runs (last 1000 years) in the PMIP3 dataset.",

            "abstract": "The organic-rich cold seep sediments in the deep Gulf of Mexico commonly contain mixtures of light hydrocarbon gases either dissolved in pore fluids, adsorbed to sediment particles, trapped in methane ice, or as free gas. The dominant component in these natural gas mixtures is typically methane (C1), but ethane (C2) and propane (C3) are nearly always present in trace or major amounts. The ratio of C1:C2:C3 varies but C2 and C3 are typically present at single digit percent levels, whereas methane usually dominates at >80%. Methane production proceeds by at least two well-studied mechanisms: either 1) by thermocatalytic cracking of fossil organic matter, or 2) as a direct product of microbial metabolism, methanogenesis. In contrast, ethane and propane production in deep-sea sediments has been historically attributed only to thermocatalytic processes. However, limited data suggests production of C2/C3 compounds through the activity of archaea. Such studies of microbial- driven dynamics of C2/C3 gases (i.e. ‘alkanogenesis’) in cold seep sediments are rare. Furthermore, the identities of potential substrates are poorly constrained and no attempt has been made to quantify production rates of C2/C3 gases. However, carbon isotopic data on ethane and propane from deep cores from the Gulf of Mexico suggest alkanogenesis at depth in the sediment column and alkane oxidation in uppermost oxidant-rich sediments. Here, we present the results of a series of incubation experiments using sediment slurries culled from GC600, one of the most prolific natural oil and gas seeps in the Gulf of Mexico. Rates of both alkane production and oxidation were measured under a variety of conditions to assess the net rates of alkane production and elucidate the driving microbiological mechanisms and controls on the central processes of >C1 alkane cycling in cold seep sediments. Microbial processes are important both in terms of alkane production and oxidation, raising many questions as to the biological production of these gases across the biosphere.",

Although coastal inundation from major tsunamis is becoming increasingly well understood, we know little about the broader aspects of such events on distal marine systems. We use time series from moored oceanic sensors to show that the March 2011 Tohoku tsunami generated days of surge-like currents and turbulent mixing in the inner basin of an anoxic fjord located on the west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, more than 7,000 km from the seafloor rupture zone. Mixing, combined with the inflow of more oxygen-rich water from the adjoining outer basin of the fjord, led to abrupt changes in the hydrodynamics, bottom sedimentation, and zooplankton behavior in the basin. These findings help define mechanisms by which major transoceanic tsunamis can significantly alter coastal marine environments located far from the source area.\n ",

            "abstract": "Geologic weathering processes in cold environments, especially subglacial chemical processes acting on rock and sediment, are not well characterized due to the difficulty of accessing these environments. Glacial weathering of geologic materials contributes to the solute flux in meltwater and provides a potential source of energy to chemotrophic microbes, and is thus an important component to understand. In this study, we use Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data to map the extent of glacial weathering in the front range of the Canadian Rockies using remotely detected infrared spectra. We ground-truth our observations using laboratory infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and geochemical analyses of field samples. The major goals of the project are to quantify weathering inputs to the glacial energy budget, and to link in situ sampling with remote sensing capabilities.\nRobertson Glacier, Alberta, Canada is an excellent field site for this technique as it is easily accessible and its retreating stage allows sampling of fresh subglacial and englacial sediments. Infrared imagery of the region was collected with the ASTER satellite instrument. At that same time, samples of glacially altered rock and sediments were collected on a downstream transect of the glacier and outwash plain. Infrared laboratory spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction were used to determine the composition and abundance of minerals present. Geochemical data were also collected at each location, and ice and water samples were analyzed for major and minor elements. Our initial conclusion is that the majority of the weathering seems to be occurring at the glacier-rock interface rather than in the outwash stream.\nResults from both laboratory and ASTER data indicate the presence of leached weathering rinds. A general trend of decreasing carbonate abundances with elevation (i.e. residence time in ice) is observed, which is consistent with increasing calcium ion meltwater concentrations towards the glacier terminus. These results are used to map the extent of regional glacial chemical weathering using ASTER thermal imagery.",

On the other hand, tribes are in search of qualified young people to work in geo- and hydro-technical fields to manage reservations’ natural resources.\nDalbotten and her collaborators at the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa and local 6-12 teachers ran a place-based but non-themed informal monthly science camps (gidakiimanaaniwigamig) for 7 years starting 2003. Camps were held on reservation and some activities focused on observing seasonal changes. The students enjoyed coming to the camps but the camp activities went largely unnoticed by the reservation itself.\nFor the last 5 years, we and the same cast of characters from the gidakiimanaaniwigamig camps ran a very place-based, research-based camp program, manoomin. The research was focused on manoomin (wild rice) which is a culturally important plant and food that grows in local lakes and wetlands. Manmade changes in hydrology, toxic metals from mining, and changing weather patterns due to climate change threaten this precious resource. Our plan was for 6-12 students to investigate the past, the present and the future conditions of manoomin on and around the reservation. It became clear by 3rd year that the research project, as conceived, was overly ambitious and could not be completed at the level we hoped in a camp setting (6 weekend camps = 6 full days per year). However, students felt that they were involved in research that was beneficial to their reservation, reported gaining self-confidence to pursue a career in science, and stated a desired to obtain a college degree. They also became aware of STEM employment opportunities on reservation that they could aim for. The camps also fostered a trusting relationship between researchers at Fond du Lac resource managers and the U. of MN.\nBased on these experiences, we proposed a new format for these camps that are based on collaboration among tribal resource managers, local teachers and university researchers. Activities focus on topics the resource managers choose. We believe this is a format that can be readily exported to other tribes and have begun testing the idea this fall.",

The aim: assessing the reliability of these temperature reconstructions and the timing of highest Tjul. The reconstructed Tjul values are evaluated in relation to local-scale/site-specific processes associated to the Holocene lake development at Loitsana, as these factors have been shown to significantly influence the fossil assemblages found in the Lake Loitsana sediments. Our study shows that the reconstructions are influenced, at least to some extent, by local factors, and highlights the benefit of using multi-proxy data in Holocene climate reconstructions. While pollen-based temperatures follow the classical trend of gradually increasing early Holocene Tjul with a mid-Holocene maximum July warming, the aquatic/wetland assemblages reconstruct higher than present Tjul already during the early Holocene, i.e. at the peak of summer insolation. We conclude that the relatively low early Holocene July temperatures recorded by the terrestrial pollen are the result of site-specific factors possibly combined with a delayed response of the terrestrial ecosystem compared to the aquatic ecosystem.",

The baseline 4STAR instrument has provided extensive data supporting the TCAP (Two Column Aerosol Project, July 2012 & Feb. 2013), SEAC4RS (Studies of Emissions, Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys, 2013), and ARISE (Arctic Radiation - IceBridge Sea and Ice Experiment, 2014), field campaigns.\nThis poster presents plans and progress for an upgrade to the 4STAR instrument to achieve full science capability, including (1) direct-beam sun tracking measurements to derive aerosol optical depth spectra, (2) sky radiance measurements to retrieve aerosol absorption and type (via complex refractive index and mode-resolved size distribution), (3) cloud properties via zenith radiance, and (4) trace gas spectrometry. Technical progress in context with the governing physics is reported on several upgrades directed at improved light collection and usage, particularly as related to spectrally and radiometrically stable propagation through the collection light path. In addition, improvements to field calibration and verification, and flight operability and reliability are addressed.",

            "abstract": "Geodynamic models of mantle plumes predict a relatively simple “bulls eye” pattern of melt generation, with maximum melt flux above the center of the conduit. However, in detail the spatial distribution of surface volcanism at hotspots is typically complex and rarely forms a simple linear array. This spatially variable geometry affords an important opportunity to probe the geochemical structure of the underlying plume, as it allows the plume conduit to be sampled at multiple locations (e.g., Loa and Kea chains at Hawaii). It also suggests that the relationship between patterns of surface volcanism at hotspots and melt generation within the underlying mantle plume is poorly understood.\nHere we report on a systematic characterization of the spatial distribution of recent (3 Ma – present) magmatism, as reflected in topography, at ten prominent oceanic intraplate hotspots. At eight of these hotspots, we find that the average topographic profile across the hotspot track (i.e., perpendicular to plate motion) shows a distinct double peak. The spacing between these peaks ranges from 19 – 45 km. This pattern conflicts with the simple single-peak pattern predicted by existing geodynamic models of melting in mantle plumes. We suggest that this double-peak pattern of surface volcanism reflects a bifurcated distribution of melt generation caused by interaction between the conduit of the plume and the overriding oceanic lithosphere.",

            "abstract": "Slip on faults occurs within very fine–grained granular gouge created by the comminution of highly fractured country rock. Due to this process of fracturing and grinding into powder, the permeability within these gouge zones naturally varies across their width, with the gouge material having relatively low permeability compared to the surrounding damage zone of fractured rock. During shear, the movement of individual grains creates local transient dilations and compactions that generate variations in fluid pressure and gouge permeability. The resulting fluid circulation, controlled by differing permeabilities across the fault, may determine aspects of the evolution of slip, such as at what position individual shear bands will materialize.\nIn order to investigate these phenomena, we extend the coupled discrete element / continuum numerical model of grain motion and fluid flow (Goren et al., 2011) to include fluid flow in the surrounding permeable fault block. We conducted numerical experiments with unconsolidated gouge confined between fault blocks. This system was held at a constant confining stress, and sheared at a constant rate similar to earthquake velocities (on the order of 1 m/s). We find that shear localizes into bands about 10 grains wide, and these bands prefer to form where they will create the least deviations in pressure, i.e. where permeability is highest. Preliminary results with a rigid, fixed-permeability fault block reveal a clear relationship between localization and fault block permeability. When the fault block has low permeability relative to the gouge, shear bands tend to form towards the interior of the gouge. When the fault block is more permeable, shear band formation tends to occur near the boundary between gouge and fault block. We see no further increase in boundary localization for fault block permeabilities on the order of 100 times the gouge permeability.\nWe will also present results from a version of the model in which the wall rock surrounding the gouge is an elastic/plastic damage zone created from cohesively bonded grains. This allows a greater degree of wall roughness, more lateral variability in wall stresses, and a heterogeneous and evolving damage zone permeability.",

In this effort, we only study crossings under IMFs whose clock angle is less than 45 degrees for a continuous interval of over 2 hours. As shown by several numerical simulations, theoretical analyses, and a few in-situ observations during recent years, asymmetries in plasma density, magnetic field and flow give rise to major features which are significantly different from those observed in a collisionless diffusion region/reconnection layer when conditions are symmetric. Our study of this specific region, i.e. poleward of the cusp, contains examples of a wide dynamic range of values of these physical parameters. Specifically, we focus on counter-streaming flows and the effects of density asymmetries, ranging up to 2 orders of magnitude and a wide spectrum of guide field values on the structure of the diffusion region.",

            "abstract": "Phenology, or the timing of life cycle events, is affected by many variables including climate. To document phenology in grassland and sandhill habitats in Santa Cruz County, we recorded the blooming statuses of all species at 10 sites every 3-4 weeks. These sites were surveyed in the 1990’s by botanist Randall Morgan, and have been resurveyed since 2012. We also recorded temperature to examine how it relates to phenology change. We have temperature records dating back to the 1980’s from local weather stations, but they do not record data at vegetation height. To compare temperature at the vegetation level with weather station records, we employed data loggers at vegetation height, and recorded soil and leaf temperature. We also measured specific leaf area (SLA), or the ratio of leaf area to the dry mass, for leaves collected in the field because leaf thickness often relates to drought and heat tolerance. We examined the relationship between SLA and phenology differences between the historic and present day surveys; also between groups of species with different ecological traits, including functional group, life cycle, and natives versus non-natives. For the temperature records, preliminary results show that temperatures from the dataloggers and weather stations were significantly correlated. Soil and leaf temperatures are also correlated with data logger temperatures, though not as strongly. Preliminary results show that SLA differs between functional groups, annuals and perennials, and native and non-native species. SLA also relates to whether plants bloom earlier, later, or do not change their phenology over time. Overall, we found that it is important to use multiple sources of temperature data, and that SLA might relate to how different types of plants change their phenology with climate.",

            "abstract": "Propagation conditions for thermospheric gravity waves in the polar regions are characterized by combination of several unique factors including interactions with the auroral activity and the polar vortex. Tropospheric sources of the gravity waves, such as wind disturbances caused by mountain relief, are likely to be complemented by energy and momentum depositions associated with fluxes of energetic particles from above. We apply recently developed Dynasonde techniques to study peculiarities of the gravity wave characteristics over Northern Scandinavia. A week-long (adjacent to the summer 2014 solstice) data series for this study has been obtained with the Dynasonde system at the EISCAT’s Tromsø Observatory operating continuously with sounding session periodicity equal to 2 min. A component of Dynasonde data analysis software, the inversion procedure NeXtYZ, has been used to attribute plasma density, plasma contour tilts, and line-of-sight Doppler values to the altitudes in real space with 1 km resolution. The temporal and spatial resolution allows visualization of the phase fronts of the traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) and measuring the full set of parameters (both vertical and horizontal) of TID activity in the upper atmosphere between the base of the E layer and the maximum of F layer, where the radar’s signal can be reflected by the ionospheric plasma. We verify the nature of the activity by substituting the TID parameters into the dispersion relation describing acoustic-gravity waves. In addition, our analysis yields statistics of the directions of propagation of the prevailing TIDs over the Tromsø location, and application of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram technique to the tilt data provides useful insight into the dynamics of spectral composition of the TIDs, which we compare to results of a similar analysis obtained for mid-latitude (Wallops Island, VA) Dynasonde location. With background atmospheric parameters taken from the Whole Atmosphere Model select waves are backtracked to their apparent source locations using a dynamical ray tracing technique.",

With regards to conservation properties, there have been two major thrusts of research: Hamiltonian methods (work done by Salmon and Dubos, primarily) and Discrete Exterior Calculus (DEC; Thuburn, Cotter, Ringler, etc.). In particular, recent work done by Thuburn and Cotter (2011) introduced a generalized framework for energy-conservative C-grid discretizations of the rotating shallow water equation using ideas from Discrete Exterior Calculus. The current research elucidates the connections between the Hamiltonian and DEC approaches, and looks at potential enstrophy conservation in addition to total energy conservation. As an illustration of this approach, an extension of the Arakawa and Lamb 1981 total energy and potential enstrophy conserving scheme to arbitrary, non-orthogonal polygonal grids is made.",

Analytical and numerical modeling analysis were both performed to predict potential vertical elevation changes based on simulated pressure changes and geomechanical properties for the targeted injection zone. Pressure changes due to continuous CO2 injection of 1.1 MMT of CO2/year over 20 years were obtained using the STOMP-CO2 numerical simulator. Injection zone elastic properties were calculated primarily from wireline geomechanical survey results that were obtained from the initial FutureGen 2.0 stratigraphic borehole. The continuous wireline geomechanical log elastic property results were utilized to estimate model layer thickness and rock compressibility for the various injection zone/model layers and were compared with hydrologic characterization results.  Compressibility estimates obtained both from hydrologically based, in-situ tests, together with limited laboratory core samples provided similarly low compressibility results (1.0510-7 to 4.9210-7 psi-1) to those derived from the geomechanical wireline surveys.  \nThe predicted surface deformation was then estimated using two parallel modelling approaches. First, an analytical Biot-based, poro-elastic model was used to calculate an equivalent vertical displacement at land surface from the expected pore pressure increase and predicted injection zone model layer rock compressibility. The second method utilized a fully 3-D geomechanical modelling analysis to calculate the expected deformation at the surface using a STOMP-CO2/ABAQUS® sequentially coupled simulator. The predicted surface uplift after 20-years of continuous injection for both methods indicated a maximum deformation of approximately 20-25 mm, with most of the deformation occurring during the first 2 years. Surface deformation monitoring will be performed using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) along with ground-based data from permanent tilt and GPS stations and annual DGPS surveys. These methods have sub-centimeter accuracies and will be able to detect the expected deformation.",

However, the processes that control NO3-N concentrations in both surface water and groundwater were not well understood, particularly for claypan-dominated watersheds. The objective of this study was to understand the processes that control the transport of NO3-N in/from surface water and/to groundwater in Goodwater Creek Experimental Watershed (GCEW), a claypan-dominated watershed in north-central Missouri. The mean nitrate-N concentration in groundwater determined from more than 2000 samples collected during 1991 - 2004 was approximately three times that in stream water at GCEW. Despite the low hydraulic conductivity of the claypan soils, considerable NO3-N contamination of the glacial till aquifer occurred, with 38% of the wells exceeding 10 mg l-1. Groundwater recharge by preferential pathways through the claypan appeared to be the primary mechanism for NO3-N movement to the aquifer. In comparison, only 19-23% of sampled wells in non-claypan agricultural watersheds over the continental U.S. exceeded 10 mg l-1, suggesting that groundwater in GCEW appears to be more susceptible to NO3-N contamination than non-claypan watersheds. Using endmember mixing analysis based on conservative tracers, stream flow during the relatively low flow periods was primarily from surface runoff, shallow subsurface water and groundwater, with an average contribution of 25%, 44% and 31% from 2011 to 2014, respectively. Stable isotopic values of nitrate (d15N, d18O and D17O) also demonstrated that groundwater exerted a major control on nitrate concentrations in stream water. This information greatly improves our understanding of the processes that control NO3-N transport to the groundwater system of claypan-dominated watersheds.",

PyKrige is a new contribution that attempts to create a Python library that can be used for basic geostatistical tasks, such as creating water level maps using Ordinary and Universal Kriging. While written in pure Python, the code makes extensive use of NumPy in order to enable fast processing. Supported drift terms for Universal Kriging currently include a regional linear drift (such as would be used to simulate an overall groundwater gradient, as discussed in Tonkin and Larson, Groundwater, 2002), a point-logarithmic drift (such as would be used to simulate wells, as discussed in Tonkin and Larson, Groundwater, 2002), and an external digital elevation model drift (such as would be used to simulate a topographically controlled groundwater surface, as discussed in Desbarats et al., Journal of Hydrology, 2002). The package is intended primarily for kriging of two-dimensional data, but limited support for three-dimensional kriging is currently under development. Though similar tools already exist for other commonly utilized scientific languages, such as R and MATLAB, PyKrige is intended to ease data processing by providing further functionality in Python that can be implemented in a single analysis pipeline. The code will be made available on GitHub.",

            "abstract": "The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami marked the advent of survivor videos mainly from tourist areas in Thailand and basin-wide locations. Near-field video recordings on Sumatra’s north tip at Banda Aceh were limited to inland areas a few kilometres off the beach (Fritz et al., 2006). The March 11, 2011, magnitude Mw 9.0 earthquake off the Tohoku coast of Japan caused catastrophic damage and loss of life resulting in the costliest natural disaster in recorded history. The mid-afternoon tsunami arrival combined with survivors equipped with cameras on top of vertical evacuation buildings provided numerous inundation recordings with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. High quality tsunami video recording sites at Yoriisohama, Kesennuma, Kamaishi and Miyako along Japan’s Sanriku coast were surveyed, eyewitnesses interviewed and precise topographic data recorded using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). The original video recordings were recovered from eyewitnesses and the Japanese Coast Guard (JCG). The analysis of the tsunami videos follows an adapted four step procedure (Fritz et al., 2012). Measured overland flow velocities during tsunami runup exceed 13 m/s at Yoriisohama. The runup hydrograph at Yoriisohama highlights the under sampling at the Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) pressure gauge, which skips the shorter period second crest. Combined tsunami and runup hydrographs are derived from the videos based on water surface elevations at surface piercing objects and along slopes identified in the acquired topographic TLS data. Several hydrographs reveal a draw down to minus 10 m after a first wave crest exposing harbor bottoms at Yoriisohama and Kamaishi. In some cases ship moorings resist the main tsunami crest only to be broken by the extreme draw down. A multi-hour ship track for the Asia Symphony with the vessels complete tsunami drifting motion in Kamaishi Bay is recovered from the universal ship borne AIS (Automatic Identification System). Multiple hydrographs corroborate the tsunami propagation through Miyako Bay and up the Hei River. Tsunami outflow currents up to 11 m/s were measured in Kesennuma Bay making navigation impossible. Further we discuss the complex effects of coastal structures on inundation and outflow hydrographs as well as associated flow velocities.",

            "abstract": "COCONET(Continuously Operating Caribbean GPS Observational Network) is a multidisciplinary research infrastructure focused on improving the ability to understand, predict, and prepare for multiple natural hazards in the Caribbean, Central America, and Northern Andes. GPS data alone cannot provide accurate ground deformation information over time and space. A precise regional reference frame is needed in interpolating GPS observations to address regional and local ground deformations. Failure to use a precise reference frame would cause unintended negative consequences. The mainly purpose of this study is to establish a stable geodetic reference frame within the COCONet footprint (abbreviated as “COCONet-RF”) and to provide positional time series and velocities (relative to COCONet-RF) of all permanent GPS stations within the COCONet footprint to the public. The GIPSY software package was used to calculate position within IGS08. The local reference frame was realized by a 14-parameter Helmert transformation technique. It will be periodically updated in order to synchronize with the update of the IGS reference frame.\nThis stable COCONer-RF would provide a higher accuracy geodetic infrastructure for delineating the magnitude and spatial and temporal variations of ground deformations associated with landslides, faulting, subsidence, and volcanoes. Researchers who are not familiar with GPS data processing and reference transformation will be able to directly integrate COCONET products into their specific research.",

            "abstract": "This research explores the interactions between data quantity, data quality and heterogeneity resolution on stochastic inversion of a physically based model. To further investigate aquifer heterogeneity, simulations are used to examine the impact of geostatistical models on inversion quality, as well as the spatial sensitivity to heterogeneity using local and global methods. The model domain is a two-dimensional steady-state confined aquifer with lateral flows through two hydrofacies with alternating patterns.\nTo examine general effects, the control variable method was adopted to reveal the impact of three factors on estimated hydraulic conductivity (K) and hydraulic head boundary conditions (BCs): (1) data availability, (2) data error, and (3) characterization of heterogeneity. Results show that fewer data increase model sensitivity to measurement error and heterogeneity. Extremely large data errors can cause severe model deterioration, regardless of sufficient data availability or high resolution representation of heterogeneity. Smaller data errors can alleviate the bias caused by the limited observations. For heterogeneity resolution, once general patterns of geological structures are captured, its influence is minimal compared to the other factors.\nNext, two geostatistical models (spherical and exponential variograms), were used to explore the representation of heterogeneity under the same nugget effects. The results show that stochastic inversion based on the exponential variogram improves both the precision and accuracy of the inverse model, as compared to the spherical variogram. This difference is particularly important for determining accurate BCs through stochastic inversion.\nLast, sensitivity analysis was conducted to further investigate the effect of varying the K of each hydrofacies on model inversion. Results from the partial local method show that the inversion is more sensitive to perturbations of K in regions with high heterogeneity. Using the variance-based global sensitivity method reveals that errors in sampling hydraulic head and fluxes at hydrofacies interfaces plays a prominent role in model accuracy.",

            "abstract": "In November and December 2013, the Marche region (Central Italy) was hit by three severe, but not rare, meteorological events. The maximum value of the three days cumulative rainfall (499 mm) was recorded at the rain gauge of Pintura di Bolognola. The intense rainfall caused floods along the rivers and triggered numerous landslides, mostly located in the hilly and mountainous terrain of the region. The territory is crossed by a large number of roads connecting small rural settlements. After the events, the Regional Civil Protection Office requested to the Research Institute for the geo-hydrological Protection (IRPI-CNR) a technical support to evaluate the hazard condition for different sites affected by landslides. For an area of approximately 200 km2, in the Municipalities of Acquasanta Terme and Roccafluvione, field surveys were carried out to identify the rainfall-induced landslides and to produce an event inventory map. More than 1,500 slope failures were mapped including earth flows, slide-earth flows, slides, rock-falls and complex slides. Field surveys were focused also to estimate qualitatively damages along the roads. Roads were classified in two classes: the main roads under the State responsibility and the secondary roads under the Municipality responsibility. The different types of damage were classified in three classes: i) aesthetic (minor), where the road functionality was not compromised; ii) functional (medium), where the functionality was compromised and iii) structural (severe) where roads are severely or completely damaged. Immediately after the event, the technicians of the Municipalities of Acquasanta Terme and Roccafluvione spent major efforts to partially restore the functionality of the secondary roads in order to guarantee the primary human needs. In the following ten days, they compiled a list of interventions, associated with the relative direct costs, aimed to the total restoration of the roads functionality. In collaboration with the technicians, we compared the estimate of the damages along the roads with the cost evaluation provided by the local authorities. The comparison allowed us to quantify the impact of the landslide events along the transportation infrastructures and to quantify the total direct cost for the secondary roads where the information was available.",

            "abstract": "Texas coastal wetlands are dynamic marsh-mangrove ecotones that play an important role in fishery recruitment, storm buffering, and carbon storage. Historically, C4 salt marsh plants, such as Spartina alterniflora, have dominated the Texas Gulf Coast. For the past 2-3 decades, some of these ecosystems have experienced community shifts with woody tropical plants (Avicennia germinans) competing for resources. This study presents new results on the carbon sequestration potential following such ecological shifts as well as coastal development and wetland loss along the coast of Texas. The recorded change from native grass-dominated C4 salt marshes to wood-dominated C3 mangroves over the last 20 years (1990-2010: 4,660 km2) leads to a non-significant loss in aboveground organic carbon (OC) stocks (-6.5.106 g OC). The most substantial loss of aboveground OC in Texas coastal salt marshes is due to the transformation of these wetlands into tidal flats and open water (-7.53.108 g OC). Similarly, the largest losses in aboveground OC stocks from mangrove ecosystems (-1.57.107 g OC) are due to replacement by open water. Along with the decrease in aboveground OC stocks, we identified a significant decrease in sedimentary OC inventories due to the loss of salt marsh and mangrove coverage (-3.69.109 g OC and 5.71.107 g OC, respectively). In contrast, mangrove expansion into mudflat and salt marsh environments led to a positive addition in aboveground OC stocks (2.78.108 g OC) and increased OC sedimentary inventories (2.32.109 g OC). Mangrove expansion offsets only 70% of the total calculated OC loss (-4.51.109 g OC) in coastal wetlands along the Texas gulf coast over the 20-year study period. This deficit loss is primarily attributed to environmental pressures on coastal salt marshes (i.e., sea level rise, urban and coastal development, erosion).",

Recognizing that innovative ideas arise from the convergence of divergent thinkers, the committee seeks to bring together faculty in Science, Engineering, the Arts and others across campus to develop and disseminate innovative ideas for research, teaching and service that will enhance the campus intellectual environment. We meet regularly throughout the year as faculty with graduate and undergraduate students to catalyze ideas that could lead to collaborative or interdisciplinary projects and make recommendations to support innovative, critical and creative work. As an example, the Department of Geological Sciences and the School of Art and Art History collaborated on a competition among UF undergraduate painting students to create artistic works that related to geoscience. Each student gathered information from Geological Sciences faculty members to use for inspiration in creating paintings along with site-specific proposals to compete for a commission. The winning work was three-story high painting representing rock strata and the Florida environment entitled “Prairie Horizontals” that is now installed in the Geoscience building entrance atrium. Two smaller paintings of the second place winner, depicting geologists in the field were also purchased and displayed in a main hallway.\nOther activities supported by SEA Change have included a collaborative work of UF engineering and dance professors who partnered for the Creative Storytelling and Choreography Lab, to introduce basic storytelling tools to engineering students. A campus-wide gathering of UF faculty and graduate students titled Creative Practices: The Art & Science of Discovery featured guest speakers Steven Tepper, Victoria Vesna and Benjamin Knapp in spring 2014. The Committee plans to develop and foster ideas that will lead to more collaborative or interdisciplinary projects and make recommendations to the administration to support a creative environment across disciplines on UF campus.",

We developed an automated dual chamber (a clear and dark chamber) system to partition NEE and assess errors in commonly used NEE partitioning techniques in arctic tundra. Measurements in the clear chamber reflected NEE, measurements in the dark chamber and nighttime clear chamber measurements reflected ER. The difference between dark and clear measurements equaled GEE and was compared with the inferred partitioned GEE. Inferred GEE and ER in the clear chamber was determined with a daytime light response curve in the clear chamber, and with an exponential relationship with soil and air temperature on nighttime clear chamber measurements. Different flux partitioning methods influenced the estimation of GEE and some approaches overestimated GEE. Our chamber design provides high frequency GEE, ER, and NEE measures that can reveal novel insights on arctic carbon cycling. ",

            "abstract": "We examine co-located outcrop and subsurface geological, geophysical, and hydrogeological observations of a cemented fault in the Rio Grande rift. The partially cemented Loma Blanca fault offsets poorly consolidated piedmont slope and alluvial sediments; along parts of its exposure the fault consists of a 2- to 5-m-wide calcium carbonate cemented zone. The degree of cementation of the fault, which varies along its >4 km long surface exposure, is closely related to host-sediment grain size; coarser grained sections of the fault are more strongly cemented than finer grained portions. We hypothesize that the spatially variable degree and thickness of cementation is a key control on the ability of the Loma Blanca fault to act as a barrier to fault-normal fluid flow. We use geologically-validated geophysical observations to map variations in fault-zone parameters in the subsurface, collecting co-located GPR, DC-resistivity, and audio-magnetotellurics data along a transect across the fault. Differences in the electrical properties between strata offset by the fault allow us to constrain fault orientation and throw. Future investigations of the relationships between the degree of fault-zone cementation and normalized chargeability may allow us to map the estimated degree of cementation in the sub-surface. Using mathematical modeling we test alternative designs for future pumping and injection well tests that will be used to update estimates of the location, orientation, and properties of the fault, especially fault-normal permeability. The goal is a novel fault-zone permeability model based on the integration of geological, geophysical, and hydrogeological observations and models.",

            "abstract": "With the increasing reliance on technology, the impact of space weather will certainly increase unless suitable protective measures are taken. It is well recognized that many space weather impacts arise from structures and dynamics of the equatorial ionosphere which is one of the most complex region that hosts numerous instabilities and irregularities or plasma bubbles. These irregularities cause information loss in satellite communications, as well as degradation in positioning and navigation signals that are used in aviation and maritime industries. An important question with considerable practical importance is whether ionospheric space weather impacts are the same over the American, African, and Asian longitude sectors, or are they different, and if so why? Satellite observations show ionospheric irregularities in the African continent is more prolific event and occurs more frequently in Africa compared to other longitudinal sectors. However, satellite observations are limited to a certain local time; and thus the needs of operational ground-based instruments, in the region like Africa, are essential to understand the physics behind the longitudinal variability of space weather impacts and improve our global forecasting capabilities which are a major objective of the space science community. Using the recently deployed ground-based multi-instruments (augmented with data from space-based instruments), we will present the temporal and seasonal variability of the space weather impacts over the African continent and provide potential evidences about the possible causes that makes the space weather impact in Africa is unique compared to other longitudinal sectors.",

            "abstract": "The Intermediate Mode Waters formed in the Southern Ocean are critical for the lower thermocline ventilation process in the Southern Hemisphere Gyres. They also might have served as the most relevant pathways transporting climatic signals from high to low latitudes via the “oceanic tunneling” on glacial/interglacial time scales. Despite the importance of the Southern Ocean Intermediate Waters (SOIWs), our understanding on the long–term evolution, exact advection paths, and impact on the South Pacific Gyre’s thermocline is still fragmentary.\nHere, we present a 200 kyr record of paired Mg/Ca ratios and stable oxygen isotope from surface dweller and deep dwelling planktonic foraminifera, from the South Pacific Gyre (SPG). On average, the Mg/Ca–derived sea Surface Temperatures (Globigerina bulloides) show similar conditions during the LGM and Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6 (9.4 °C versus 9.9 °C). In contrast, our Mg/Ca–derived subsurface temperatures (Globorotalia inflata and Globorotalia truncatulinoides) suggest LGM from ~3 to ~2 °C colder than MIS 6. The reconstructed subsurface ice volume corrected stable oxygen isotope ratio of seawater (δ18Osw-ivc, proxy for local salinity changes) suggests opposing glacial subsurface conditions, i.e., slightly saltier–than–Holocene during MIS 6 to fresher–than–Holocene during MIS 2. Considering that subsurface hydrography at the core site is plausibly driven by the formation and/or advection of SOIWs from the South East Pacific, our results provide further support on the relevance of subsurface processes in the Southern Ocean transferring climatic signals (temperature and salinity) to the SPG. Furthermore, the contrasting subsurface glacial scenarios at the SPG’s thermocline imply that the advection of SOIWs during glacial stages could be highly variable during different glacial stages.",

            "abstract": "The activities of soil enzymes, influence critical ecological processes including decomposition, and transformation of organic matter, biogeochemical cycling and applications for industry, medicine, and energy. The p-nitrophenol (pNP)-based methods are widely used in agronomic and ecological studies but an adequate high-throughput, microplate method has yet to be adopted. The overall goal of this study is to further refine current pNP microplate methods to reduce the high variability and low sensitivity previously reported. Specific objectives were to: 1) determine the correct ratio of soil:water to ensure similar quantities of soil are compared regardless of texture; 2) reduce variability between replicates by removing soil particles from wells using filters embedded within microplate wells; 3) identify the influence of homogenization timing on enzyme activity; and 3) compare results to the traditional bench scale method. b-glucosidase activity was determined in sandy loam and clay loam soils with four homogenization times (2, 3, 4, and 5 minutes) with filtered microplates. Soil textural class significantly affected the actual quantity of soil pipetted into microplate wells, which supports the necessity to quantify actual soil used and adjust soil:water ratios. Results from the microplate method were significantly correlated with those of the bench scale results with an average r2 of 0.98 and an average slope of 1.37. The filtered plates removed the variability otherwise imparted by soil particles in the non-filtered technique with an average coefficient of variation of 7.3% (range was 2-24%). Slope increased with increasing homogenization with no significant difference between the 2 and 3 minute tests and the 4 and 5 minute tests. Results from additional tests will be discussed that evaluate a larger variety of soils under different management and environmental conditions.",

            "abstract": "Organic compounds comprise a significant mass fraction of submicron atmospheric particles with considerable contribution from secondary organic aerosol (SOA), a large fraction of which is formed from the oxidation of biogenic volatile organic compounds. Aqueous-phase reactions in particles and cloud droplets are suggested to increase SOA mass and change the chemical composition the particles following cloud evaporation. Aqueous-phase processing may also explain discrepancies between measurements and models. To gain a better understanding of these processes, cloud water and below-cloud atmospheric particles were collected onboard a research aircraft during the Southeast Oxidants and Aerosol Study (SOAS) over Alabama in June 2013. Nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI) and direct electrospray ionization (ESI) coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry were utilized to compare the organic molecular composition of the particle and cloud water samples, respectively. Several hundred unique compounds have been identified in the particle and cloud water samples, allowing possible aqueous-phase reactions to be examined. Hydrolysis of organosulfate compounds, aqueous-phase formation of nitrogen-containing compounds, and possible fragmentation of oligomeric compounds will be discussed, with comparisons to previous laboratory studies. This study provides insights into aqueous-phase reactions in ambient cloud droplets.",

This zone is not as seismically active as some other regions in Mexico, such as the subduction zone along the Pacific coast. However, there is evidence of major historical earthquakes (M > 7) occurring on the volcanic belt near densely populated cities such as Mexico City, Guadalajara and Morelia. Furthermore, almost 50% of the population of the country lives in cities and towns located on the Volcanic Belt. Using empirical magnitude-Intensity regressions, data obtained from historical descriptions of earthquakes were calibrated with instrumental data to determine their moment magnitude in order to create a complete seismic catalogue of this geological province. We propose a methodology to solve the problem of merging both historical and instrumental datasets. The method consists of dividing our catalogue into three different segments, according to the temporary nature and magnitude of our records. This segmentation was made considering the cut-off magnitude of our catalogue. In this way, we determined three Gutenberg-Richter distributions and correlated them geometrical and statistically. Based on the local seismic sources and using Bayesian statistics as well as appropriate seismic waves attenuation models, we generate seismic hazard maps that would be useful for more than 40 million people that live in the zone.",

            "abstract": "There is growing consensus among model projections that climate change may increase the frequency and intensity of drought in the rain-fed, maize-dominated, Midwestern US. Uncertainty in the availability of water, combined with an increased demand for non-grain ethanol feedstock, may necessitate expanding the production of more water-use-efficient and less drought sensitive crops for biomass applications. Research suggests that biomass sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is more drought tolerant and can produce more biomass than maize in water-limiting environments; however, sorghum water use data are limited for the rain-fed Midwestern US. To address this gap, a replicated (n=3) side-by-side trial was established in Ames, Iowa to determine cumulative water use and water-use-efficiency of maize and biomass sorghum. Data were collected by micrometeorological stations located in the center of each plot and used to calculate cumulative evapotranspiration throughout the 2014 growing season using the residual energy balance method. Continuous micrometeorological measurements were supplemented by periodic measurements of leaf area index (LAI) and above-ground biomass. At mid-point of the growing season, preliminary data analysis revealed similar water use for sorghum and maize. Data collection will continue for the remainder of the growing season, at which point a stronger conclusion can be drawn. This research will provide important insight on the potential hydrologic effects of expanding biomass sorghum production in the Midwestern, US.",

From drifting polar cap patches to bursty bulk flows (BBFs) in the mid-tail, the redline aurora provides key information about system-level dynamics and coupling between plasma regimes. In this paper we present a new all-sky imager (ASI) array that measures the 6300Å emission line from neutral Oxygen in the aurora. The array coverage extends from south of Gillam, Manitoba, to north of Resolute Bay, Nunavut, and to the west of Fort Smith, NWT, and the array is synchronized at 3 second cadence in the same manner that the THEMIS ASI array is. The camera has superior resolution and noise performance compared to previous generations of auroral cameras. The imager employs only one filter and thus monitors one auroral line throughout the array simultaneously and continuously (at high cadence). The new design has better immunity to internal scatter and produces images of faint aurora when the moon is in the field of view, which corrects another deficiency of some currently deployed auroral imager systems. We present the new instrument design, test data from the commissioning phase of the array deployment, and thoughts on the scientific potential of the array.",

            "abstract": "Footbridges across streams and rivers provide rural communities in many countries essential access to hospitals, schools, and economic opportunities. Without these, communities experience isolation during the rainy season. However, many of these bridges are subject to immersion at times, and there is a need for sensing the river stage before venturing onto a bridge. We have developed an inexpensive, robust, self-contained sensor that meets this need. A two-wire electrical cord, purchased in bulk from a home improvement supplier, is the basic sensing element. The two conductors of the cord form a transmission line capacitor. The cord is suspended below the footbridge and the capacitance is a function of the fraction of the electrical cord that is immersed in water. The cord/capacitor is part of the timing element of an electronic oscillator circuit. As the water level rises, the capacitance and oscillator frequency decrease. The oscillator frequency is measured with a microcontroller. The microcontroller calculates the corresponding water stage and displays it on a small LCD display. The electronics are contained in a 12×7×7 cm watertight container. Four AA batteries power the sensor. The device has calibration features to accommodate different types of electrical cord.",

            "abstract": "The intermediate depth earthquakes of high moment magnitude (Mw ≥ 8) in Chile have had a relative greater impact in terms of damage, injuries and deaths, than thrust type ones with similar magnitude (e.g. 1939, 1950, 1965, 1997, 2003, and 2005). Some of them have been studied in details, showing paucity of aftershocks, down-dip tensional focal mechanisms, high stress-drop and subhorizontal rupture. At present, their physical mechanism remains unclear because ambient temperatures and pressures are expected to lead to ductile, rather than brittle deformation. We examine source characteristics of more than 100 intraslab intermediate depth earthquakes using local and regional waveforms data obtained from broadband and accelerometers stations of IPOC network in northern Chile. With this high quality database, we estimated the total radiated energy from the energy flux carried by P and S waves integrating this flux in time and space, and evaluated their seismic moment directly from both spectral amplitude and near-field waveform inversion methods. We estimated the three parameters Ea, τa and M0 because their estimates entail no model dependence. Interestingly, the seismic nest studied using near-field re-location and only data from stations close to the source (D<250km) appears to not be homogeneous in terms of depths, displaying unusual seismic gaps along the Wadati-Benioff zone. Moreover, as confirmed by other studies of intermediate-depth earthquakes in subduction zones, very high stress drop ( >> 10MPa) and low radiation efficiency in this seismic nest were found. These unusual seismic parameter values can be interpreted as the expression of the loose of a big quantity of the emitted energy by heating processes during the rupture. Although it remains difficult to conclude about the processes of seismic nucleation, we present here results that seem to support a thermal weakening behavior of the fault zones and the existence of thermal stress processes like thermal shear runaway as a preferred mechanism for intermediate earthquake triggering. Despite the non-exhaustive aspect of this study, data presented here lead to the necessity of new systematic near-field studies to obtain valuable conclusions and constrain more accurately the physics of rupture mechanisms of these intermediate-depth seismic event.",

Coral δ18O varies with SST and δ18Osw, which varies with oceanic and hydrologic processes whereas coral Sr/Ca varies with SST because Sr and Ca in seawater are invariant on centennial time scales. Comparison of coral δ18O-SST and Sr/Ca-SST anomalies reveals a persistent +0.3‰ divergence in coral δ18O prior to 1936 CE suggesting a shift in hydrology in which relatively 18O rich surface waters are present as the result of more evaporation than precipitation. Coral δ18O variations from 1649–1936 CE contain interannual to bidecadal variations larger than those observed from 1936–1999 CE and in the coral Sr/Ca-SST reconstruction, suggesting hydrological shifts on those time scales. Long-term coral δ13C variations provide a record of anthropogenic CO2 uptake in the ocean. Coral δ13C records reveal a shift to lower values (Δ=–0.9‰) starting ~1850 CE, a shift greater than that observed in corals from Fiji. The rate of change varies but approaches a constant rate from 1945–1980 CE and then increases from 1980–2000 CE.",

Experimental studies, however, are limited to low pressures and low temperatures (i.e., ~20 GPa and < 2000K). First-principles computations have now expanded viscosity estimates in to the P-T range of Earth's lower mantle, but only on the MgSiO3 end-member. In this study, we determined the viscosity of an (Mg, Fe)O liquid up to 5000 K and pressure up to 70 GPa, using a laser-heated diamond-anvil cell (LHDAC). We will discuss the effect of pressure, temperature and iron on the viscosity of (Mg,Fe)O. These results will help to further constrain the viscosity of a magma ocean at high pressures, thus increasing our understanding of the evolution of early Earth.",

            "abstract": "Nitrification is the sole link between nitrogen inputs and losses in marine ecosystems, and understanding the microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of nitrification is therefore crucial for understanding how aquatic ecosystems process nitrogen. Recently-discovered ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), rather than ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), appear to drive ammonia oxidation in many ecosystems, including much of the ocean. However, few studies have investigated these microbes in estuary waters, despite the fact nitrogen concentrations in estuaries are often far higher than the ocean, and can cause drastic ecological harm. We sought to determine the roles of AOA and AOB in driving pelagic nitrification throughout San Francisco Bay, by combining biogeochemical rate measurements with a suite of measurements of the abundance and diversity of AOA and AOB. It addition to traditional functional gene analyses and high-throughput 16S amplicon sequencing, we developed novel qPCR assays to selectively target the ammonia-oxidizing clades found in this estuary, which gave insights into clade-specific distributional patterns. Our biogeochemical data suggest a sizable fraction of ammonium in the bay is oxidized in the water column, likely by AOA, with nitrification in bottom waters also oxidizing a substantial portion of the ammonium exuded by sediments. Generally, Sacramento River waters and Suisun Bay bottom waters had the highest nitrification rates. AOA outnumbered AOB at most stations, and were present in high abundance at both the marine and freshwater ends of the estuary, while AOB abundance was highest in the low-salinity, brackish regions. Different archaeal clades were found at either end of the estuary, suggesting strong niche partitioning along the salinity gradient, with a third clade present largely in brackish waters. This work helps to assess the ability of ammonia-oxidizing microbes in estuaries to transform nitrogen prior to water discharge into the sea, and furthers our understanding of the roles of specific clades of these microbes in complex estuarine ecosystems.",

All reservoirs trap sediment that had previously been transported downriver to either the ocean or larger bodies of water. The trapping of reservoirs has implications for reservoir longevity and downstream channel geomorphology or ecology. Concerns associated with reservoir sedimentation include the loss of reservoir storage capacity, river channel incisement and degradation downstream from dams, loss of channel capacity downstream, impacts to reservoir and river ecology and water chemistry, and impacts to cultureal resources and municipal water supplies. Climate change with resulting impacts to hydrologic and sediment dynamics could have profound management implications for water agencies. To date, little effort has been made by the federal water management agencies to include reservoir sedimentation in their planning or operational considerations.

Due to their interaction with fluids, hydrological properties change and lead to a weakening of the fault. Some of the weakest clay gouge has been recovered from SAFOD core along the active Central Deforming Zone of the San Andreas Fault, with a coefficient of friction as low as µ=0.095. We conducted laboratory shearing experiments to investigate the microstructural fabric development and frictional behavior of powders and natural intact fault gouge to characterize differences in mechanical and hydrological properties caused by varying smectite clay fabrics. In this study we used almost pure clay powder from SAF gouge (<63 µm) and mixed it with varying amounts of quartz or SAF clasts (120-500 µm). We sheared gouge layers in a double-direct shear configuration housed in a pressure vessel, at an effective normal stress of σ'n = 5 MPa and under saturated conditions with a pore pressure of 2 MPa. We used a relatively low normal stress to allow recovery of material after the experiments for microstructural investigation. We sheared the layers at a constant velocity of 10 µm/s, followed by a series of slide-hold-slide tests to characterize frictional properties. After the experiments all samples were analyzed using a focused ion beam - scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM) in order to reconstruct the 3D microstructures associated with experimentally induced polished slip surfaces at the micro- to nanometer scale. Initial results document clear stages of clay fabric development related to the clay to clast ratio, which exhibit similarities with naturally developed fabrics. In smectite-dominated mixtures, principle slip surfaces develop parallel to each other, but these features are modified as the clast content increases. With higher clay content strain hardening becomes more prominent. Clay minerals and fabric developed during shear have a strong effect on gouge mechanical and hydrological properties, and therefore likely play a key role in controlling fault gouge slip behavior at seismogenic depth.",

However, current inversion techniques tend to become inaccurate when sediment-induced acoustic attenuation is high (e.g., large suspended concentrations). In such cases, statistical fluctuations cause an accumulation of errors along the observed profile, which leads to an ill-posed inverse problem, even if the intrinsic properties of the scatterers are exactly known. Here, a statistical inversion methodology is introduced in which the ill-posed problem is regularized by explicitly considering the uncertainty of the observational data. The method uses the Extended Kalman Filter to estimate the propagation of uncertainty through the profile, followed by a variational smoothing step. This approach is shown to successfully estimate concentration and size profiles in cases where direct inversion fails. The method is also applied to laboratory experiments involving a multi-frequency megahertz acoustic profiler (MFDop) measuring a sediment-laden jet.",

            "abstract": "Dating the youngest phase of metamorphic or magmatic zircon growth by in-situ techniques on sectioned zircons can be challenging when rims are only a few microns thick; in the worst case, geologically meaningless measurements result from mixing between different age and/or compositional growth domains. This is especially true for zircons from the Zanskar Shear Zone and Tso Morari UHP Complex, NW Himalaya, which contain Eocene to Miocene rims that grew over Paleozoic and Proterozoic protolith cores during peak and retrograde metamorphism. These metamorphic rims are typically only 0.5 to 3.0 microns thick and require high-spatial resolution to resolve. We used the SHRIMP-RG ion-microprobe to perform new U-Pb depth-profiling analyses on zircon surfaces (non-polished) pressed into indium metal. Zircons from a leucogranite dike from Malung Tokpo along the Zanskar Shear Zone, which have 2000-5000 ppm U rims, were selected for detailed depth-profiling to evaluate the depth-resolution by SIMS for U-Pb and trace element analyses. Due to the high U concentration, we were able to decrease the primary beam intensity (sputter rate) and the count times for U and Pb isotopes, and increase the number of cycles through the run-table (45 peak-hopping scans). As a result, each cycle yielded a 0.04 micron depth-resolved zircon age and trace element composition. The youngest 13 scans yielded a U-Pb age of 21.3 ± 0.5 Ma, representing a 0.6 micron rim with uniform U, Th, and Hf concentrations. At 1.15 microns, the primary beam sputtered into a ~600 Ma core; this older age is complicated by the fact that it reflects mixing between the bottom of the sputter volume and the Miocene ages of the pit margins and rim, because the diameter of the spot tends to increase with time. Trace element analyses on zircon surfaces from the Tso Morari UHP Complex are highly reproducible, showing enriched HREE profiles with negative Eu anomalies – a result that is difficult to reproduce by analyses of sectioned crystals.",

Their hydraulic properties are critical parameters for determining fluid migration and leakage, and are subject to alterations when exposed to reactive flow, e.g. CO2-acidfied brine in the case of carbon storage. Our previous studies have shown how mineral heterogeneity could lead to increased roughness that mitigates the increase in fracture permeability. This study shows that, even in rocks with mineral homogeneity, fracture geometry is subject to complex alterations. In this presentation, we report an experimental study of CO2-acidified brine in fractured Indiana Limestone, with comprehensive characterization of effluent chemistry analyzed by ICP-OES, and 3D geometry evolution using micro-computed topography (xCT). Significant carbonate dissolution was observed but the reaction extent revealed by the effluent chemistry was less than what was predicted by simple reaction transport models. xCT imaging revealed the formation of wormhole channels in the fracture, and the channels grew larger downstream and more prominent over time. Using the fracture geometries derived from the xCT images, we simulated the flow field and inferred the evolution of fracture hydraulic properties. To interpret the process of wormholing and its impacts on fracture hydraulic properties, we used reactive transport modeling to simulate the interplay between fracture geometry, fluid flow and geochemical reactions. Our simulations predicted that wormholes were formed in fractures with initial roughness representative of natural subsurface systems. The presence of wormholes caused a disproportionately larger permeability increase than would be expected given the extent of volume change. ",

            "abstract": "Earth system land models typically resolve permafrost regions at spatial resolutions grossly larger than the scales of topographic variation. This observation leads to two critical questions: How much error is introduced by this lack of resolution, and what is the effect of this approximation on other coupled components of the Earth system, notably the energy balance and carbon cycle?\nHere we use the Arctic Terrestrial Simulator (ATS) to run micro-topography resolving simulations of polygonal ground, driven by meteorological data from Barrow, AK, to address these questions. ATS couples surface and subsurface processes, including thermal hydrology, surface energy balance, and a snow model. Comparisons are made between one-dimensional “column model” simulations (similar to, for instance, CLM or other land models typically used in Earth System models) and higher-dimensional simulations which resolve micro-topography, allowing for distributed surface runoff, horizontal flow in the subsurface, and uneven snow distribution. Additionally, we drive models with meteorological data averaged over different time scales from daily to weekly moving windows. In each case, we compare fluxes important to the surface energy balance including albedo, latent and sensible heat fluxes, and land-to-atmosphere long-wave radiation.\nResults indicate that spatial topography variation and temporal variability are important in several ways. Snow distribution greatly affects the surface energy balance, fundamentally changing the partitioning of incoming solar radiation between the subsurface and the atmosphere. This has significant effects on soil moisture and temperature, with implications for vegetation and decomposition. Resolving temporal variability is especially important in spring, when early warm days can alter the onset of snowmelt by days to weeks. We show that high-resolution simulations are valuable in evaluating current land models, especially in areas of polygonal ground.

            "abstract": "It is well established that the atmospheric Stable Boundary Layer (SBL) can display distinct regimes of flow. In the weakly stable boundary layer, turbulence is weak but continuous and the surface flow is coupled to that aloft. In the very stable boundary layer, turbulence collapses and the surface flow becomes decoupled from the flow above.\nThis study demonstrates the clear presence of two distinct SBL regimes in a long record of observations from the 213m tower in Cabauw, Netherlands. These regimes are found in the joint distribution of near-surface stratification, shear, and vertically-averaged wind speed. Hidden Markov model (HMM) analysis is used to distinguish these regimes and objectively classify states as being in one regime or the other. This classification allows for a detailed diagnosis of the flow, stratification, and turbulence structures within each of the two regimes, as well as their relation to large-scale forcing through the geostrophic wind and cloud cover. Observational evidence is presented that the very stable boundary layer is produced by a previously-discussed positive feedback associated with a maximum sustainable turbulent heat flux.",

            "abstract": "Flocculated sediment transport is a primary determinant of hydrodynamics and geomorphology in many muddy nearshore environments which contain significant amounts of clay. In these nearshore and estuarine environments, as in most oceanic environments, the clay mineral occurrence is dominated by the following: montmorillonite (2:1 expandable), illite (2:1 non-expandable) and kaolinite (1:1 non-expandable). However, the percentages of clay minerals within these environments vary significantly. This work addresses the importance of clay mineral percentages on floc growth rates and stability. A series of analyses used four different ratios of montmorillonite, illite and kaolinite; these ratios serve to simulate the clay mineral assemblage in four different rivers. The clay minerals were mixed into saline water within which guar, a nonionic biopolymer, had previously been dissolved. Upon addition, the mixture was shaken vigorously for several minutes and then the system was allowed to settle into a quiescent environment. Flocs were maintained in a quiescent, no-flow environment until analyzed. The analyses consisted of subjecting the flocs to three flow rates within a flow through particle size analyzer, CILAS1190. For each flow rate, floc sizes were quantified and stability was inferred from changes in floc size. The flocs were analyzed during a two month period; assessments were made after 1d, 2d, 7d, 14d, 1m and 2m from the initial mixing. Results indicate that while floc size increased significantly over time, total floc stability changed less significantly. This work suggests that floc growth and stability may be achieved in a relatively short duration of time within quiescent environments. The importance of hydrodynamic stress on floc size and stability will be an important aspect for future research; subjecting flocs to hydrodynamic stress will address the importance of particle collisions and fluid-induced stress on floc size and stability.",

            "abstract": "The persistence of dense-non-aqueous-phase liquids (DNAPLs) in the subsurface has led practitioners and regulatory agencies to turn towards low-maintenance, low-cost remediation methods. Biological degradation has been suggested as a possible solution, based on the well-proven ability of certain microbial species to break down dissolved chlorinated ethenes under favorable conditions. However, the biodegradation of pure phase chlorinated ethenes is subject to additional constraints: the continuous release of electron acceptor at a rate governed by mass transfer kinetics, and the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of DNAPL source zones which leads to spatially and temporally variable availability of the reactants for reductive dechlorination. In this work, we investigate the relationship between various DNAPL source zone characteristics and reaction kinetics using COMPSIM, a multiphase groundwater model that considers non-equilibrium mass transfer and Monod-type kinetics for reductive dechlorination. Numerical simulations are performed for simple, homogeneous trichloroethene DNAPL source zones to demonstrate the effect of single source zone characteristics, as well as for larger, more realistic heterogeneous source zones. It is shown that source zone size, and mass transfer kinetics may have a decisive effect on the predicted bio-enhancement. Finally, we evaluate the performance of DNAPL bioremediation for realistic, thermodynamically constrained, concentrations of electron donor. Our results indicate that the latter may be the most important limitation for the success of DNAPL bioremediation, leading to reduced bio-enhancement and, in many cases, comparable performance with water flooding.",

            "abstract": "Chemical weathering of the continents plays a key role in the global carbon cycle and delivers solutes to the ocean. Past studies, documented using radiogenic isotopes of detrital and seawater samples, show the intensity of weathering varies with climate over a range of time scales.. We analyzed Pb and Nd isotopic values of seawater extracted from dispersed Fe-Mn oxides, <2µm (clay) and <63µm (silt) detrital fractions of Pliocene to Holocene sediment from Gulf of Mexico ODP Site 625B to evaluate long term variations in weathering fluxes for three time slices: the Pliocene/early Pleistocene, Mid Pleistocene Transition (MPT), and late Pleistocene/Holocene. We also examine short term glacial/interglacial variations.\nLittle variation is seen in Nd isotopes of detrital fractions with age, suggesting little change in the average age of material delivered to the Gulf. Seawater Nd values become less radiogenic over the Pleistocene, consistent with observed changes in Caribbean seawater. Pb isotopes of silt fractions are also relatively constant through time, but clay fractions are more radiogenic at the MPT and dispersed Fe-Mn oxides trend to more radiogenic values in the late Pleistocene. Consequently, the Pb isotopes of dispersed Fe-Mn oxides tend to be less radiogenic than the detrital fractions in samples older than 2000 ka and more radiogenic than the detrital fractions, particularly clays, at the MPT. This may reflect greater incongruent silicate weathering during the MPT, a change in weathering conditions that could be consistent with the Regolith Hypothesis.\nOver glacial/interglacial timescales, dispersed Fe-Mn oxides Pb isotopes become more radiogenic than detrital fractions, and clay fractions become more radiogenic than silt fractions, during glacial periods. However, all fractions have similar values during interglacials. This pattern is distinct from previous studies that found enhanced incongruent silicate weathering during warm intervals, but is consistent with recent work finding a correlation with carbonate content, whereby low carbonate during glacials at Site 625 corresponds to a greater offset between leachate and detrital Pb isotopes. Biases from “heavy mineral effects” and changes in circulation during periods of lower sea level also need to be considered.",

            "abstract": "Genomic analysis of soil communities can only be useful in predicting ecosystem processes if the genetic data gathered is representative of the microbial community. Consequently, extracellular DNA (eDNA) represents a pool of unexpressed genetic information that may skew genomic analyses. To date, our understanding of the representation of eDNA in metagenomic data and its decomposition in soil is very limited. To address this deficit, we performed a laboratory experiment wherein soils were amended with eDNA and/or clay minerals in a full factorial design. Specifically, the decomposition of 13C labeled E. coli DNA was monitored over a 30-day period in control, Kaolinite-amended, and Montmorillonite-amended soils. The amount of added eDNA carbon (C) remaining in the soil declined exponentially over time, with the majority of decomposition occurring in the first two weeks. Kaolinite significantly decreased eDNA decomposition rates and retained a higher fraction of eDNA–C (~70% remaining) than unamended and Montmorillonite-soils (~40% remaining) after 30 days. Phylogenetic (16S rRNA) sequencing of DNA extracted over the course of the incubation period enabled detection of the added eDNA. The relative abundance of added E. coli DNA decreased ~10-100 fold over 30 days. These results indicate that while a significant fraction of eDNA-C remained in the soil, this carbon was likely no longer in the form of intact strands of DNA amenable to sequencing. In addition, the eDNA affected the composition of the bacterial community. Specifically, the relative abundance of Planctomycetes and TM7 were elevated in soils that received eDNA regardless of clay addition, suggesting these phyla may be particularly effective at degrading eDNA and using it for growth. In conclusion these results indicate that the representation of eDNA in metagenomic sequence data declines rapidly, likely due to fragmentation. However, a fraction of eDNA material was resistant to decomposition, suggesting a substantial amount of recalcitrant eDNA could accumulate over time.",

            "abstract": "In this study, a private collection of diamondiferous eclogite xenoliths has been made available for non-destructive investigation. All samples have at least one diamond visible. The samples are predominantly sourced from the Excelsior and Newlands mines (South Africa), with additional samples from Roberts Victor mine (South Africa) and Orapa (Botswana).\n3D volume models of the samples were created using X-ray tomography. The 3D images reveal abundant secondary veining that is clearly younger than the eclogite. Diamonds are located in fluid pathways and occur in both altered garnet and altered clinopyroxene. Most of the veining is unrelated to the spatial positioning of diamond in the samples. In some instances, early veining has annealed or partially annealed, suggesting a range in timing of at least some of the several metasomatic events that have affected the rock.\nImportantly, in the most graphic examples, a clear distinction can be seen between diamond-bearing and non-diamond-bearing veins, even where sulphide is present in abundance in the non-diamond-bearing veins. The amount of diamond detected in the xenoliths varies from a single crystal to well over 50 diamonds forming more than 9% of the rock. This extreme value contrasts with the diamond recovery from currently viable diamond mines of less than 2ppm or 0.0002%.\nThe morphology of the diamonds includes step-faced flat-faced octahedra, single crystals and aggregates. This is particularly a feature of diamonds in the Excelsior specimens. In the samples from Newlands and Orapa, in contrast, diamond surfaces reflect resorption processes such as rounding and corrosion of the diamonds.\nThe following conclusions can be drawn from this study:\nDiamonds in this collection, sourced from within the Kalahari craton, appear to have formed by a metasomatic process during which fluids infiltrated pre-existing mantle-derived eclogite;\nSeveral metasomatic events have occurred during the residence of the eclogite in the mantle;\nSome of these metasomatic events have been diamond-friendly, whilst others have been diamond-neutral or diamond-destructive;\nDiamond can be present at very high concentrations along particular metasomatic fluid pathways in eclogitic mantle rocks;\nThe absolute timing of diamond formation is still to be determined.",

The cloud of the volume about 30 cubic meters is generated in the open atmosphere by the original aeroelectrical facility consisting of the source of the aquated ions and the high-voltage discharger. Representing the charge density distribution as a superposition of regular and irregular parts, a model of the electrical structure of the cloud is developed. The regular part is calculated under the stationary current approximation taking into account the source current structure, the shape of the cloud, and results of the multi-point measurements of the electric field and conductivity in the vicinity of the cloud. The irregular part describes random spatiotemporal fluctuations of the charge density which are assumed to be proportional to the aerosol number density. It is shown that a quasi-electrostatic ﬁeld of the charged aerosol is characterized by signiﬁcant spatial ﬂuctuations showing the scale invariance. The mean-square ﬂuctuations of the voltage between different parts of the cloud are proportional to the square root of its linear dimensions and may reach signiﬁcant values even in the absence of the regular ﬁeld. The basic parameters of the fluctuating spatial structure of the electric field inside the charged aerosol cloud are estimated. It is shown that the charge density fluctuations could lead to a significant (up to 2,5 times) local enhancement of the electric field as compared to the field of the regular part of the charge density. The above effect could serve as one of the important mechanisms of the spark initiation.",

            "abstract": "Regional water supply systems undergo surplus and deficit conditions due to differences in inflow characteristics as well as due to their seasonal demand patterns. This study presents a framework for regional water management by proposing an Inter-Basin Transfer (IBT) model that uses climate-information-based inflow forecast for minimizing the deviations from the end- of-season target storage across the participating reservoirs. Using the ensemble streamflow forecast, the IBT water allocation model was applied for two reservoir systems in the North Carolina Triangle area. Results show that inter-basin transfers initiated by the ensemble streamflow forecast could potentially improve the overall water supply reliability as the demand continues to grow in the Triangle Area. To further understand the utility of climate forecasts in facilitating IBT under different spatial correlation structures between inflows and between the initial storages of the two systems, a synthetic experiment was designed to evaluate the framework under inflow forecast having different skills. Findings from the synthetic study can be summarized as follows: (a) Inflow forecasts combined with the proposed IBT optimization model provide improved allocation in comparison to the allocations obtained under the no- transfer scenario as well as under transfers obtained with climatology; (b) Spatial correlations between inflows and between initial storages among participating reservoirs could also influence the potential benefits that could be achieved through IBT; (c) IBT is particularly beneficial for systems that experience low correlations between inflows or between initial storages or on both attributes of the regional water supply system. Thus, if both infrastructure and permitting structures exist for promoting inter-basin transfers, season-ahead inflow forecasts could provide added benefits in forecasting surplus/deficit conditions among the participating reservoirs in the regional water supply system.",

            "abstract": "We investigated the use of synchrotron radiation for elemental imaging within the skeleton of a Porites coral from American Samoa to explore the fine-scale structure of strontium to calcium (Sr/Ca) variability. The use of a synchrotron for coral paleoclimate analysis is relatively new. The method provides a high resolution, two-dimensional elemental map of a coral surface. The aragonitic skeleton of Porites sp. colonies has been widely used for paleoclimate reconstruction as the oxygen isotope ratio (δ18O) signal varies with both sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface salinity (SSS). Sr/Ca has been used in previous studies in conjunction with δ18O to deconvolve SST from SSS, as Sr/Ca in the coral skeleton varies with SST, but not SSS. However, recent studies suggest that in some cases Sr/Ca variability in coral does not reliably reflect changes in SST. We sought to address this puzzle by investigating Sr/Ca variability in Porites corals at a very fine spatial scale while also demonstrating the suitability of the synchrotron as a coral analysis tool. We also considered Sr/Ca variability as it pertains to the coral’s structural elements. The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center synchrotron station generates collimated x-rays in the energy range of 4500-45000 eV with beam diameters as small as 20 μm. Synchrotron imaging allows faster and higher-resolution Sr/Ca analysis than does inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). It also is capable of mapping spatial distributions of many elements, which aids in the development of a multiproxy approach to paleoclimate reconstruction. Imaging and analysis of the Porites coral using synchrotron radiation revealed an intricate sub-seasonal Sr/Ca signal, possibly correlating to a sub-monthly resolution. This signal, which seems unrelated to SST, dominates the annual signal.",

            "abstract": "Natural gas extracted from shale formations accounts for 40% of the domestic U.S. natural gas supply. Although natural gas combustion emits less carbon dioxide per energy produced than other fossil fuels, this climate benefit may be offset by the methane emitted to the atmosphere through leaks in the natural gas production and distribution infrastructure. To better understand the climate impacts of the oil and natural gas extracted from the Bakken shale play in North Dakota, we present airborne measurements of methane taken over this region aboard a NOAA Twin Otter aircraft during Spring 2014. Using the mass balance technique, we estimate methane emissions from the region with four flights intended for this purpose in May 2014. We further attribute these methane emissions to the oil and gas industry using measurements of ethane and other hydrocarbons aboard the Twin Otter.",

            "abstract": "Altered disturbance regimes are likely a primary mechanism by which a changing climate will affect storage of carbon in forested ecosystems. Accordingly, the National Forest System (NFS) has been mandated to assess the role of disturbance (harvests, fires, insects, etc.) on carbon storage in each of its planning units. We have developed a process which combines 1990-era maps of forest structure and composition with high-quality maps of subsequent disturbance type and magnitude to track the impact of disturbance on carbon storage. This process, called the Forest Carbon Management Framework (ForCaMF), uses the maps to apply empirically calibrated carbon dynamics built into a widely used management tool, the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS).\nWhile ForCaMF offers locally specific insights into the effect of historical or hypothetical disturbance trends on carbon storage, its dependence upon the interaction of several maps and a carbon model poses a complex challenge in terms of tracking uncertainty. Monte Carlo analysis is an attractive option for tracking the combined effects of error in several constituent inputs as they impact overall uncertainty. Monte Carlo methods iteratively simulate alternative values for each input and quantify how much outputs vary as a result. Variation of each input is controlled by a Probability Density Function (PDF). We introduce a technique called “PDF Weaving,” which constructs PDFs that ensure that simulated uncertainty precisely aligns with uncertainty estimates that can be derived from inventory data. This hard link with inventory data (derived in this case from FIA – the US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis program) both provides empirical calibration and establishes consistency with other types of assessments (e.g., habitat and water) for which NFS depends upon FIA data. Results from the NFS Northern Region will be used to illustrate PDF weaving and insights gained from ForCaMF about the role of disturbance in carbon storage.",

            "abstract": "Previous analyses of Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) data indicate that high thermal inertia (TI) materials within the cratered highlands north of Hellas are in situ bedrock units enriched in olivine. The high TI materials occur in both ~3.5 Ga infilled, flat-floored craters as well as ~3.8-4.0 Ga expanses of intercrater plains. A spatial association of the intercrater plains units with the Hellas ring structures suggests that they may have resulted from magma ascension and eruption via crustal fractures. Infilled craters may have formed after individual impact events triggered decompressional melting and effusive volcanism. Here we examine the mineralogy of both the high TI intercrater plains materials and high TI crater floor materials to the north of Hellas (30°E to 85°E and 7°S to 27°S) using Vis/NIR spectral data from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM). We report on the spatial distribution and variability of observed mafic minerals (olivine, low-calcium pyroxene, and high-calcium pyroxene) to constrain whether the formation of these outcrops were caused or influenced by a single event (e.g., the Hellas impact), multiple individual events, or by some other means, and to provide overall insight into Noachian/Hesperian crustal evolution of Mars.",

            "abstract": "Forest cover changes have potential to induce large shifts in water fluxes, including short-term responses like changing downstream flood risk and longer-term feedbacks between land surface water and the atmosphere that can influence local and regional weather patterns. Two main challenges in capturing vegetation changes within hydrological forecasting systems, however, are finding real-time data streams to characterize these changes and the ability to accurately translate readily observable qualities such as “greenness” to modelled biophysical and biochemical properties.\nHere we investigate the feasibility of using near real-time remote sensing products paired with a continuous-running atmosphere - land surface - hydrology model to characterize vegetation disturbance and regrowth dynamics, with the ultimate goal of improving short-range (hourly to daily) and mid-range (weekly to monthly) operational streamflow forecasts. We use WRF-Hydro, a framework for coupling components of land surface models, hydrologic models, and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) atmospheric model. We take advantage of newly implemented data assimilation techniques in WRF-Hydro to assimilate MODIS near real-time observations into the NoahMP dynamic vegetation model to simulate disturbance and regrowth following (1) wildfire in the Southwest U.S. and (2) plantation forestry management in the Southeast U.S. Ranges of modeled vegetation structural (leaf and stem area, height, canopy organization) and biochemical (chlorophyll content) characteristics consistent with MODIS observations are used to estimate uncertainty ranges in downstream flow predictions.\nThe WRF-Hydro framework allows us to characterize changes in streamflow behavior expected after these modeled forest disturbances, evaluate when and where assimilation of vegetation characteristics from remote sensing is most important to streamflow prediction, and quantify the role of recovering vegetation biophysical/biochemical state uncertainty in predicted streamflow probability distributions. These hindcast examples, by relying solely on near real-time data streams, provide a basis for improving representation of post-disturbance vegetation dynamics in future operational hydrological forecasting systems.",

From our analysis of petroleum industry wells, we have found over 600 wells drilled on the Gulf of Mexico continental slope that penetrate the gas hydrate stability zone and contain well logs useful for appraising gas hydrate accumulations. We identify natural gas hydrate in petroleum industry wells based on an increase in resistivity of at least 0.5 ohm*m from the background resistivity. Using this criterion, we have identified at least 40 wells with gas hydrate occurrence. Some of these new prospects have significant hydrate accumulations. For example, in Alaminos Canyon Block 810 we found a natural gas hydrate accumulation with up to 10 ohm*m resistivity above the background resistivity and over 715 feet of hydrate.\nBSRs occur at many gas hydrate sites near the thermodynamic base of the gas hydrate stability zone, but , as many recent drilling expeditions have shown, drilling a BSR is not a guarantee of locating a natural gas hydrate accumulation. We will combine a comprehensive analysis of BSRs on the continental slope with our extensive basin-wide review of gas hydrate accumulations occurring in petroleum industry wells in this area. We will consider both traditional (also called continuous) BSRs, which are uninterrupted seismic events that mimic the seafloor and discontinuous BSRs which are disparate individual seismic events that usually appear along dipping strata. By combining these singular data sets, we will identify a relationship between BSR occurrences and gas hydrate accumulations in the northern Gulf of Mexico.",

Since that time, modifications to the geologic time scale have been significant, particularly in recent decades (e.g., the Ordovician, Carboniferous, Permian, and Quaternary), owing in part to more precise biostratigraphic zonations and advances in isotopic dating techniques. Because the definitions of geologic time intervals have been modified as more information is gathered, interpreted, and published, the geologic age of a unit as stated in a report published in, for example, 1950, may be different according to today's time scale.\nIn order to ensure that people can search Geolex for geologic units according to today’s time scale, we have updated to the modern time scale the age estimates for many geologic units.

            "abstract": "More than half of the global warming potential of GHG emissions from agriculture is attributed to nitrous oxide (N2O).. Many factors control the production and release of N2O from soils. In addition to fertilizer N, soil N, moisture and carbon availability control N2O emissions. In addition, a previously overlooked factor, iron, was recently found to be the most significant factor influencing N2O production. Controlled by soil and management factors, N2O production is attributed to multiple pathways, including ammonia oxidation (AO), denitrification, and abiotic chemical reactions. Ammonia oxidation or nitrifier activity N2O production, is a well known pathway, but it significance to total N2O production is also highly debated and soil conditions influencing its production are poorly understood. Studies in a variety of crops in California strongly suggest that this pathway contributes substantially to N2O emissions. It is well established that denitrification primarily occurs under O2- limiting conditions, while N2O produced from AO is also influenced by soil O2 content, with maximum production occurring at low O2 levels (~0.5%). Since emission of N2O can arise from both AO and denitrification activities at low O2 concentrations, it is difficult to discern the importance of each pathway under various soil conditions and management. Furthermore, both the N form and concentration are determinants of nitrifier N2O production. The nitrifier denitrification pathway has been shown to dominate over nitrifier nitrification and nitrification coupled denitrification pathways. Irrigation, rainfall, and fertilization events stimulate microbial activity, including AO and denitrification that produces N2O and although limited, these events contribute to the majority of annual emissions. This uncertainty and complexity surrounding N2O production pathways has hampered the development of practices to reduce N2O emissions. As agricultural production intensifies in developing countries, mitigation strategies will increasingly rely on an understanding of how N2O is produced in agricultural soils.",

Methods include innovations developed using Earthscope/USArray data (e.g., the ambient noise cross-correlation techniques, Rayleigh wave H/V observations). In this presentation, the preliminary results of surface wave investigations utilizing the GLISN network are presented with four principal aspects. First, we measure the Rayleigh wave dispersion from ambient noise cross-correlations and explore their use to derive the information about the structure of the uppermost mantle, crust and icesheet. Second, we made measurements of the Rayleigh wave H/V ratio from teleseimic earthquakes and investigate their use to quantify the physical-state of the ice-sheet. Third, using the surface wave dispersion information and Rayleigh wave H/V ratios, we perform a Bayesian Monte Carlo inversion to infer the shear velocity structure of the ice-sheet, crust and uppermost mantle of Greenland. Finally, we explore time variations in the surface wave dispersion and H/V ratio to determine whether such variations can be observed and used to constrain seasonal and perhaps secular changes in the structure of the ice sheet.",

High inflow from GBM associated with the intense rainfall is the source of flood in Bangladesh. Flood Forecasting and Early Warning (FFEW) is the mandate and responsibility of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) and Flood Forecasting and Warning Center (FFWC) under BWDB has been carrying out this responsibility since 1972 and operational on 7-days a week during monsoon (May to October). FFEW system started with few hours lead time has been upgraded up to to 5-days with reasonable accuracy. At FFWC numerical Hydrodynamic model is used for generating water level (WL) forecast upto 5-days at 54 points on 29 rivers based on real-time observed WL of 83 and rainfall of 56 stations with boundary estimationa on daily basis. Main challenge of this system is the boundary estimation is the limited upstream data of the transboundary rivers, obstacle for increasing lead-time for FFEW. The satellite based upper catchment data may overcome this limitation. Recent NASA-French joint Satellite mission JASON-2 records Water Elevation (WE) and it may be used within 24 hours. Using JASON-2 recorded WE data of 4 and 3 virtual stations on the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers , respectively (upper catchment), a new methodology has been developed for increasing lead time of forecast. Correlation between the JASON-2 recorded WE on the virtual stations at the upper catchment and WL of 2 dominating boundary stations at model boundary on the Ganges and Brahmaputra has been derived for generating WL forecast at those 2 boundary stations, which used as input in model. FFWC has started experimental 8-days lead-time WL forecast at 09 stations (5 in Brahmaputra and 4 in Ganges) using generated boundary data and regularly updating the results in the website. The trend of the forecasted WL using JASON-2 data is similar to those upto 5-days forecast generated in the existing system. This is a new approach in FFEW in Bangladesh where boundary estimation becomes possible using JASON-2 observed WE data of the Transboundary rivers. There is scope of further development of this system along with increase of lead time.\n",

            "abstract": "Quantitative characterization of earthquake clustering in space and time in relation to different event sizes and physical properties of the lithosphere are fundamental problems of statistical seismology. Recently, we approached these problems by taking advantage of the new statistical results, improved empirical constraints, and relatively uniform high-quality earthquake catalogs available for southern California and other selected regions. This led to identification and classification of statistically significant earthquake clusters in southern California, relating cluster characteristics to effective viscosity of the crust, and documenting some robust properties of observed earthquakes not simulated by the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model. Extending these results to other seismically active areas and lower magnitude ranges, however, is impeded by inferior data quality. Most available catalogs are based on non-uniform recordings/analyses that lead to non-uniform (in space, time, magnitude) location errors, varying magnitude of completeness, and other problems. These non-uniformities may (and do) produce artificial patterns in the space-time-magnitude clusters of seismicity detected by our, as well as other, methods. In the present work we document the effects of catalog errors on inferred cluster properties, and report some striking patterns that emerge as artifacts of those errors. This includes apparent magnitude dependence, fluctuations in the proportion of singles (clusters consisting of individual events), space-dependent distance to the likely parents of events, and other effects. We also discuss additional differences between the ETAS model and observed seismicity. Finally, we propose a generalization of our method that involves assigning multiple possible parents to each event, and discuss some graph-theoretic techniques that may provide results that are more robust to location errors and other catalog deficiencies.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic Tomography is a method of aquifer characterization that estimates hydraulic parameters related to the subsurface, such as hydraulic conductivity and storage, from measurements of hydraulic heads at numerous observation locations during a series of hydrologic tests, commonly pumping tests. Characterizing the subsurface is important for many hydrogeologic projects such as site remediation and groundwater resource exploration. Oscillatory Hydraulic Tomography (OHT) is a method of imaging that uses a tomographic analysis of periodic signals. These signals are generated at distinct locations by oscillatory pumping tests in which fluid is extracted for half a period then re-injected. The transmitted effects of these signals are recorded at observation wells. The resulting measurements can be used to reconstruct the spatial variation of hydraulic parameters by solving a nonlinear inverse problem, which we solve using the geostatistical approach. Oscillatory pumping test data were collected in the summer of 2013 in an extensive field campaign at the Boise Hydrogeophysical Research Site (BHRS), a moderately heterogeneous unconfined aquifer. We present results of OHT applied to the BHRS.",

However, representing the terrestrial heterogeneity of biogeochemistry in earth system models (ESMs) remains a critical scientific challenge. We investigated the impact of spatial scaling on environmental controls and predicted soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks across the state of Alaska, USA. We used over 500 soil profile observations and environmental factors such as topography, climate, land cover types, and surficial geology to predict the SOC stocks at 50 m spatial resolution. We upscaled both the predicted SOC stocks and environmental variables from finer to coarser spatial scales (100 m, 200 m, 500 m, 1 km, 2 km, 5 km, and 10 km) and generated SOC stock estimates for each scale till the predicted variance of SOC stocks became constant. We found different environmental factors as statistically significant predictors at different spatial scales. Topographic attributes were important predictors at finer scales whereas surficial geology types became significant predictors at larger spatial scales. Only elevation, temperature, potential evapotranspiration, and barren land cover types were significant predictors at all scales. The controls (predictive power) of these environmental variables on SOC stocks decreased with upscaling. Highest and lowest decrease in predictive power was observed for potential evapotranspiration (55%) and elevation (25%). Similarly, intermediate decrease was observed for temperature (45%), and barren land cover types (45%). The predicted variance of SOC stocks decreased by 45% as the spatial scaling was increased from 50 m to 10km. We believe the statistical structure of the scaling behavior of SOC stocks can inform ESMs in appropriately representing the spatial heterogeneity of SOC stocks.",

Effects of the two factors are of importance in quantifying the carbon dynamics in these artificial systems, but remain unclear. From 9 years (2005-2013) of carbon exchange observations in a mature (13 years old in 2005) and a young (2 years old in 2005) loblolly pine plantations located on the lower coastal plain in eastern North Carolina, we investigated the difference in temperature sensitivities (Q10) of ecosystem respiration (ER) of the two plantations of different ages. The mature plantation was thinned in August 2009, therefore, we compared the ER before and after thinning to estimate the potential response of Q10 to thinning in the mature plantation. Before thinning (years of 2005 - early half year of 2009), Q10 of ER in the mature plantation was similar across years. Even during a severe drought (e.g. 2007), Q10 did not differ from other years (p = 0.2 – 0.8 between years). The mean Q10 before harvesting was 2.33±0.05 (mean±SE). After thinning (years of 2010-2013), there was significant inter-annual variation in Q10 with an overall estimate at 2.23±0.05. The young plantation also exhibited significant inter-annual variations in Q10, and the overall Q10 was 2.99±0.11, higher than that of the mature plantation. The increased variability of temperature sensitivity after thinning in the mature plantation might be associated with the altered physical environment by thinning such as soil bulk density and soil water content, whereas the similar pattern in the young plantation might result from the primary contribution of heterotrophic respiration and also be confounded with the fast growth of young seedlings.",

            "abstract": "Many of the challenges for recognizing and reconstructing habitable environments on early Mars are shared by the early Earth. However, a number of key differences obscure the possibility for direct comparison of the evolutionary history of surface environments on the two planets. In particular, while the “faint young Sun” paradox can potentially be solved on the early Earth via high levels of reduced greenhouse gases such as the methane, the early and probably continuous oxidation (and lack of any methane today on Mars) of the Martian surface precludes a similar solution for early Mars. This necessity for a different atmospheric evolutionary history also complicates the interpretation of Martian sedimentary rocks because fundamentally different weathering reactions and different reaction rates would have occurred on early Mars relative to early Earth. In this context, it is possible to evaluate recent claims for Martian paleosols at Gale Crater using both model- and data-based methods of looking at weathering processes there and on the early Earth. The putative paleosol interpretation contrasts strongly with mission scientists, who found, for example, that major element geochemistry of weathering products at Mars’ surface indicate little pedogenesis as compared with similar environments on Earth (McLennan et al. 2014, Science). Mass balance gains and losses of redox-sensitive metals (e.g., Cu and Cr) and other trace elements have been proposed as potential biosignatures for early Earth, do not exhibit similar patterns at Gale Crater. While there are orders of more data for the early Earth, this suggests either that there was little or no biological activity at Gale Crater or that those putative biosignatures were not appropriate for the aqueous environments there because they were derived from non-analogous environments. This disconnect between both paleosols/weathering environments of the early Earth and with predictions of expected weathering trends in comparison to observations from Gale Crater suggest that improvements both to our understanding of Earth analogues for Martian environments and more realistic simulations of the differences in atmospheric evolution for Mars are necessary to advance our understanding of potential or realized habitability on Mars.",

The model representation of carbon allocation mechanisms significantly influence the simulated carbon stock and land-atmosphere exchange in Earth System Models (ESMs). Few previous studies, however, have investigated and evaluated the above-belowground carbon allocation in ESMs. In this study, we analyzed carbon density in belowground, total vegetation (above + belowground), and belowground:vegetation ratios of eleven ESMs from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), which were used for the latest IPCC Assessment Report (AR5).\nOverall, results of ESMs are not consistent with observational data; both the belowground and total vegetation carbon density are underestimated in tropical/subtropical and temperate regions, while overestimated in arctic/subarctic regions. Moreover, the ratios of belowground:total vegetation carbon are underestimated in all three climate zones. The model-data discrepancies in carbon density vary substantially among biomes, while the ratios of belowground:total vegetation carbon are consistently underestimated across all major biomes expect tropical moist forests. This study indicates that the carbon allocation algorithms in current ESMs need to be improved to better simulate vegetation growth and its responses to global change.",

            "abstract": "While the general principles of hydraulic fracturing are well known, there are many aspects of the process that require further understanding, particularly the role of natural fractures both as part of the stimulated fracture network and as background, unstimulated fractures. Discrete fracture network (DFN) models are useful experimental tools for testing hypotheses about fracture controls on production. DFN numerical experiments use a range of fracture network geometries from simple parallel fractures, to complex networks that incorporate stimulated natural fractures. The results of models and comparisons with production data provide constraints on the geometries and properties of the stimulated fracture networks.\nThe geometries of matrix blocks and fractures have a strong influence on the pressure and rate declines during production. Simple fracture networks consisting of parallel, equally-spaced hydraulic fractures produce pressure and flow transient behaviors that range from linear (square-root) to bilinear (fourth-root) with distinct fracture and matrix dominated stages. The transition times between these stages depend on the fracture sizes and properties and the matrix-block sizes and properties. Unlike the simple systems, which have only a single matrix block size, complex networks contain a distribution of block sizes. The complex systems produce early time behaviors that lie between the linear and bilinear cases until the small blocks within the stimulated volume are depleted and the overall stimulated volume behaves as a single linear source. An inspection of production data, which has been deconvoluted to produce an equivalent constant-rate signature, suggests behaviors that are consistent with complex fracture-network behaviors.",

            "abstract": "Evidence points to a key role of the Atlantic circulation in controlling climate changes during the last deglacial (20-10 ka), though quantifying the rate of past ocean circulation remains an open challenge. Existing Atlantic rate proxy records over the last deglacial exhibit pronounced differences both in timing and magnitudes at both deep and intermediate depths. This uncertainty calls for more rate proxy data at key sites to improve understanding of the driving mechanisms behind the Atlantic observations. This study examines three complementary rate proxies (231Pa/230Th, Δ14C and sortable silt grain size) of Equatorial Atlantic sediment cores from 2.7 to 4.1 km depth from the east and west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.\nSediment cores from the Ceara Rise in the western basin (4.1 km depth; 3.3 km depth) support a picture of relatively 14C-depleted deep water with higher Pa/Th values during the Last Glacial Maximum compared to the modern day. During Heinrich Stadial 1, there is a marked increase in Pa/Th values. Measured opal fluxes indicate that opal scavenging is not the main driver of the observed Pa/Th changes. At the same time, radiocarbon data indicate that the most 14C-depleted signature occurs at around 3 km water depth. Sortable silt mean size also shows distinctive changes around this period, but with some offset in timing potentially related to changes in circulation rate at different scales. Results from two new cores collected on a recent cruise (JC094) will be used to extend our understanding of these Equatorial Atlantic glacial-deglacial rate proxy dynamics and their relative timings. Both cores were collected far from the continental margin, in the central and eastern Atlantic (7o26.10’N, 21o47.78’W, 3.4 km depth; 15o27.86’N, 50o59.49’W, 2.7 km depth) providing a synoptic basin scale view of these important rate tracers in the Atlantic.",

            "abstract": "ADHydro is a physics-based, high-resolution, distributed hydrological model suitable for simulating large watersheds in a massively parallel computing environment. It simulates important processes such as: rainfall and infiltration, snowfall and snowmelt in complex terrain, vegetation and evapotranspiration, soil heat flux and freezing, overland flow, channel flow, groundwater flow and water management. For the vegetation and evapotranspiration processes, ADHydro uses the validated community land surface model (LSM) Noah-MP. Noah-MP uses multiple options for key land-surface hydrology and was developed to facilitate climate predictions with physically based ensembles. This presentation discusses the lessons learned in coupling Noah-MP to ADHydro. Noah-MP is delivered with a main driver program and not as a library with a clear interface to be called from other codes. This required some investigation to determine the correct functions to call and the appropriate parameter values. ADHydro runs Noah-MP as a point process on each mesh element and provides initialization and forcing data for each element. Modeling data are acquired from various sources including the Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO), the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, and internal ADHydro simulation states. Despite these challenges in coupling Noah-MP to ADHydro, the use of Noah-MP provides the benefits of a supported community code.",

            "abstract": "Mapping the magma pathway geometry beneath active volcanoes is vital to providing an understanding of how each system works, what drives its dynamics and what eventually controls the surface expression of volcanism. Seismicity can provide clues about the subsurface plumbing, but the seismic catalog is often incomplete. The broad spectrum of seismic phenomena at volcanoes, from discrete earthquakes to the continuous hum of tremor, hampers event identification, and there are no standard seismological tools to resolve this problem. Even at Kīlauea, one of the best-instrumented and most studied volcanoes in the world, a detailed source geometry remains elusive. Here we present the first map of a volcano’s deep plumbing system by taking a new approach to seismic monitoring. Using envelope cross-correlation, we systematically scan through 2.5 years of continuous seismic data to identify and locate thousands of undocumented volcanic sources, which we interpret to map the path of magma ascent from the deep mantle, offshore south of the Big Island, to the lava lake in Kīlauea’s crater. The results offer a fundamental insight into the source of Kīlauea volcanism and generate a baseline understanding that increases our ability to interpret pre- and co-eruptive observations.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to quantitatively assess the effect of organic matter self-assembly on its resistance to microbial mineralization. Humic acids isolated from leonardite, two peats and a mineral soil were used as organic matter samples because they provide a broad range of variability in terms of the origin and nature of their organic components. Using a solvent-based fractionation method, humic acid samples were disassembled into a humic-like component and a humic-lipid composite. The humic-lipid composite was further disassembled into an amphiphilic and a lipid component using an alkaline aqueous solution. Mixtures that reproduced the composition of self-assembled samples were prepared by mixing the solid individual fractions in the exact proportions that they were present in the original material. The original humic acids or their corresponding mixtures were added as the sole carbon source in separate aerobic cultures containing a microbial consortium isolated from a mineral soil. After incubation for 125 days mineralization of the self-assembled samples was shown to be higher by as much as 70% compared to their corresponding physical mixtures. The extent of mineralization of the self-assembled samples was not correlated to the material’s chemical composition or hydrophobicity index obtained from their 13C solid-state NMR spectra. In contrast, mineralization of the physical mixtures and the individual fractions did vary with chemical composition and was accompanied by preferential mineralization of alkyl carbon. These results suggest the microbial mineralization of humic acids is related to their self-assembly.",

            "abstract": "Hurricane Sandy made landfall along the New Jersey coast at 8pm EDT on October 29th, 2012. At landfall wind gusts of between 129 and 145 km/hr were recorded in New York and New Jersey. The large wind field associated with the storm generated an extreme storm surge north of the eye at landfall resulting in high-velocity overland storm surge along the northern barrier Islands of the Barnegat Bay followed 7 hours later by a rapid rise in water level along the bayside of the barrier islands.\nA high-resolution, hydrodynamic model for the Barnegat Bay estuary; including its vast intertidal areas, has been developed and validated to simulate the observed Sandy storm surge. The Barnegat Bay Inundation Model (BBIMS) has a constant 100m resolution and is nested within the three dimensional Stevens NYHOPS ocean circulation model at its offshore open boundary. Wetting and drying of land features in the model’s external time step is as low as 0.1 sec in its 2D barotropic mode. This mode provides for the dynamic prediction of depth integrated flood elevations and velocities across land features during inundation events.\nThe BBIMS was calibrated using the NYHOPS hindcast of Hurricane Sandy. The hindcast utilized Sandy over ocean wind field and atmospheric pressure data, offshore wave and tidal boundary forcing, atmospheric heat fluxes, interior stream flow data and was validated against observed water levels and measured high water marks. A comparison against 6 water level time series measured by USGS tide gauges located in the Barnegat Bay verified that the model is able to capture the spatial and temporal variation of water levels in the Bay observed during Hurricane Sandy. A comparison against the verified high water marks found that the model is capable of hincasting overland water elevation to within 0.63ft (one standard deviation) at 71% of the total water marks measured.\nThe modeling results show that strong northerly winds along the axis of the estuary prior to landfall suppressed the storm surge in the northern portion of the Bay. A rapid shift in wind direction to southerly winds after landfall allowed the surge to propagate north up the estuary as a shallow water wave (Figure 1). The effect of future sea levels on surge propagation in the estuary is investigated through increases in model mean sea level.",

            "abstract": "The U.S. coastal communities today face a higher risk of experiencing economic and social disasters than before due to their exposure to an increasing number of coastal hazards and also, because they have experienced a dramatic increase in population and property values over time. Given the continuous increase of coastal population, identifying at-risk communities will help mitigate coastal hazard impacts and prepare for future coastal hazard events. This study fulfills this goal by determining the effectiveness of two global data sets Landscan (gridded population data) and NOAA’s Night Time Imagery from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and the U.S. census data at the census block level that are used for demographic analysis and monitoring population dynamics in the U.S. For this study, the global data sets for the years 2011 and 2012, the census data for 2010 were used in conjunction with parcel boundary data (finest resolution data that can be used as a proxy for population data) available annually for Florida.\nThrough comparative analysis, the following research questions were explored: (1) which data set can accurately determine population density and its spatial distribution? (2) how much error is associated with each data set and what is the spatial distribution of error? The study is conducted for the coastal counties of Florida. A preliminary analysis using parcel level data as reference data set revealed that almost 25% of population was lost by both Landscan and VIIRS data sets in comparison to parcel data. Further analysis will be conducted to determine the spatial distribution of error, to identify the correlation between data sets, and identify the data set that is less erroneous in estimating population and its spatial distribution.",

            "abstract": "Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) from the Amazon forest represent the largest regional source of organic carbon emissions to the atmosphere. These BVOC emissions dominantly consist of volatile and semi-volatile terpenoid compounds that undergo chemical transformations in the atmosphere to form oxygenated condensable gases and secondary organic aerosol (SOA). However, the oxidation pathways of these compounds are still not well understood, and are expected to differ significantly between “pristine” conditions, as is common in Amazonia, and polluted conditions caused by emissions from growing cities. Our focus is to elucidate how anthropogenic emissions influence BVOC chemistry and BSOA formation through speciated measurements of their oxidation products. We have deployed the Semi-Volatile Thermal desorption Aerosol Gas Chromatograph (SV-TAG) at the rural T3 site located west of the urban center of Manaus, Brazil as part of the Green Ocean Amazon (GoAmazon) 2014 field campaign to measure hourly concentrations of semi-volatile BVOCs and their oxidation products during the wet and dry seasons. Primary BVOC concentrations measured by the SV-TAG include sesquiterpenes and diterpenes, which have rarely been speciated with high time-resolution. We observe sesquiterpenes to be anti-correlated with ozone, indicative of sesquiterpene oxidation playing a major role in the regional oxidant budget. The role of sesquiterpenes in atmospheric SOA formation are of interest due to their high aerosol yields and high reactivity with ozone, relative to more commonly measured BVOCs (e.g. monoterpenes). We explore relative concentrations of sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes and their roles as precursors to SOA formation by combining SV-TAG measurements with those from an additional suite of VOC and particle measurements deployed in the Amazon. We also report the first ever hourly observations of the gas-particle partitioning of speciated terpene oxidation products in the Amazon and discuss their implications for photochemical transformation and SOA formation in the region.",

In practice, the NYCA partners with external experts in professional development, informal education and evaluation to assist in developing and implementing certain programs of the NYCA EPO activities. Two specific program initiatives of the NYCA EPO effort offer excellent examples of programs with strong science content knowledge as well as using effective tools to address the NSF impact categories. These are the ExxonMobil Bernard Harris Summer Science Camp (EMBHSSC, in conjunction with RPI’s STEM Pipeline Initiative) and the Astrobiology Teachers Academy (ATA).\nThe EMBHSSC for middle school students focuses on NASA astrobiology initiatives around the “Quest for Life” theme. The Camp has a comprehensive evaluation component and uses pre-and post- assessment of student knowledge and interest in STEM. Recent data suggest that every student has shown a measurable gain in these areas.\nThe ATA is a weeklong summer intensive professional development program for P-12 STEM teachers that combines discipline scientists in the NYCA with an external evaluation organization, the Association for the Cooperative Advancement of Science and Education (ACASE). The goal is for teachers to develop a new learning module for a course they teach that uses astrobiology as a content focus to engage students. The Academy has scientists collaborating with teachers in this effort, providing content and assistance in designing instructional activities. Assessments are woven into the fabric of the work in a few ways: 1. There is a purposeful focus on assessment as part of the learning module, and the content of the ATA; 2. ACASE offers teachers a tool for tracking their students’ attainment of the learning goals identified in their learning module; 3. There are daily evaluations of the teachers’ experiences to enable mid-course corrections, and a final evaluation of the ATA at the end of the experience. NYCA scientists support the approach of working collaboratively with external experts in evaluation as a paradigm for EPO activities sponsored by NASA. Our presentation will highlight the myriad of tools used to measure outcomes of these activities.",

            "abstract": "Extreme heat stress during the crop reproductive period can be critical for crop productivity. Projected changes in the frequency and severity of extreme climatic events are expected to negatively impact crop yields and global food production. This study applies the global crop model PEGASUS to quantify, for the first time at the global scale, impacts of extreme heat stress on maize, spring wheat and soybean yields resulting from 72 climate change scenarios for the 21st century. Our results project maize to face progressively worse impacts under a range of RCPs but spring wheat and soybean to improve globally through to the 2080s due to CO2 fertilization effects, even though parts of the tropic and sub-tropic regions could face substantial yield declines. We find extreme heat stress at anthesis (HSA) by the 2080s (relative to the 1980s) under RCP 8.5, taking into account CO2 fertilization effects, could double global losses of maize yield (dY = −12.8 ± 6.7% versus −7.0 ± 5.3% without HSA), reduce projected gains in spring wheat yield by half (dY = 34.3 ± 13.5% versus 72.0 ± 10.9% without HSA) and in soybean yield by a quarter (dY = 15.3 ± 26.5% versus 20.4 ± 22.1% without HSA). The range reflects uncertainty due to differences between climate model scenarios; soybean exhibits both positive and negative impacts, maize is generally negative and spring wheat generally positive. Furthermore, when assuming CO2 fertilization effects to be negligible, we observe drastic climate mitigation policy as in RCP 2.6 could avoid more than 80% of the global average yield losses otherwise expected by the 2080s under RCP 8.5. We show large disparities in climate impacts across regions and find extreme heat stress adversely affects major producing regions and lower income countries.",

This re-processed dataset will provide high quality estimates of land motions, enabling regional and global high-precision geophysical/geodetic studies. Several of the individual TIGA Analysis Centers (TACs) have completed processing the full history of GPS observations recorded by the IGS global network, as well as, many other GPS stations at or close to tide gauges, which are available from the TIGA data centre at the University of La Rochelle (www.sonel.org). The TAC solutions contain a total of over 700 stations. Following the recent improvements in processing models and strategies, this is the first complete reprocessing attempt by the TIGA WG to provide homogeneous position time series. The TIGA Combination Centre (TCC) at the University of Luxembourg (UL) has computed a first multi-year weekly combined solution using two independent combination software packages: CATREF and GLOBK. These combinations allow an evaluation of any effects from the combination software and of the individual TAC contributions and their influences on the combined solution. In this study we will present the first UL TIGA multi-year combination results and discuss these in terms of geocentric sea level changes",

            "abstract": "Organic carbon discharged by rivers and buried in continental margin sediments represents an important carbon sink and a valuable record of information on past environmental variations on the continents. In this context, it is crucial to understand the sources of carbon in river basins and the factors that influence biomarker signals during transport from the continental source to the oceans. In this study, we adopt a source-to-sink approach where concentration and compositional variations in branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs), plant wax fatty acids and lignin phenols in fine-grained (<63 µm) riverbank sediment deposits from the Danube River are investigated. Using this multi-proxy approach, we seek to establish geochemical “fingerprints” of the largest tributaries and follow the evolution of these signatures along the course of the river, from headwater tributaries to its delta. Spatial trends in biomarker concentrations along the river transect are assessed by normalizing them on the mineral-specific surface area of the sediment. Surface area normalized brGDGT concentrations show a clear trend to decreasing values (ng brGDGT m-2) from the upper to the lower catchment. The distributions of brGDGTs, a group of soil bacterial membrane lipids that has been shown to record local environmental parameters, reflect the trend of increasing air temperature along the course of the Danube. This trend suggests an increasing contribution of soil organic carbon from tributaries with a more continental and warmer climate in the lower Danube basin to the OC that is finally delivered to the delta. More detailed insights into the evolution of the organic carbon composition within the Danube river basin will stem from compound-specific δD, δ13C and ultimately 14C measurements on terrestrial biomarkers in riverbank and suspended sediments.",

            "abstract": "Rivers are estimated to deliver 27 Mmol a-1 of mercury (Hg) to ocean margins, which is comparable to the global atmospheric deposition flux of Hg to the ocean. Previous studies presumed that most of this riverine Hg is sequestered by settling to the coastal regions. However, there has been little investigation of the mechanism and efficiency with which this sequestration takes place, and the implications for riverine influence in different ocean regions. Here we develop a global 3-D chemical transport model for Hg in the ocean (MITgcm-Hg) with ecology (DARWIN model). We track offshore export of the discharged Hg from heterogeneous river systems over different ocean regions, and how it is influenced by the interaction of Hg in a variety of geochemical forms with carbon and suspended particles. We constrain our model assumptions with available offshore observations that bear strong riverine signals. Modeling results suggest that some of the riverine Hg is highly refractory, sorbs strongly to particles and does not follow equilibrium partitioning with the dissolved phase. Simulated global Hg evasion from riverine sources is 50 times larger without this refractory particulate pool, which results in a total evasion flux two times larger than our current best estimate. Based on a typology system of global rivers, we calculate that 10% to 60% of the particulate Hg from different rivers settles in ocean margin sediments because of subgrid sedimentation processes. The remaining 7.5 Mmol a-1 (28% of total river discharge) is available for offshore transport, where it undergoes further sedimentation to the shelf (5.3 Mmol a-1) as well as evasion to the atmosphere (0.44 Mmol a-1). Only 1.7 Mmol a-1 (6.4% of the global riverine Hg) reaches the open ocean, although that fraction varies from 2.6% in East Asia because of the blockage of Korean Peninsula to 25% in east North America facilitated by the Gulf Stream. We find large riverine influences over coastal oceans off East Asia, and the contributions elsewhere are much smaller due to less riverine Hg discharge. We find the transport of riverine Hg is most influenced by its release rates from organic carbon pools and particle sinking velocities. Varying these parameters changes the contribution of riverine sources to the Hg concentrations over the open ocean for a factor of 2.",

            "abstract": "Large-scale hydrological models are important tools for water resources management. Model predictions are used in agricultural, contamination, water scarcity, and groundwater depletion applications and for well-field management. The predictions, used for management and practical decision-making, are sensitive to variations in hydrostratigraphy, thus uncertainty can be addressed by sampling the structural model space. Hydrostratigraphic input to large-scale hydrologic models is commonly based on one-truth geologic models.\nHigh resolution airborne electromagnetic (AEM) data with extensive spatial coverage are valuable for use in hydrostratigraphic modeling. In particular, geological structures and within-unit heterogeneity, which are poorly identified with spatially scarce borehole lithology data, are well resolved by AEM data. The challenge is to combine geophysical and hydrological information in a common parameter space. We propose to estimate hydrological model prediction uncertainties using an ensemble of resistivity and borehole based hydrostratigraphic models.\nSingle hydrostratigraphic models are created using a semi-automatic sequential hydrogeophysical inversion method, which integrates AEM and borehole data. A spatially variable translator function converts electrical resistivities obtained from geophysical inversion into clay fractions through correlation with borehole lithological observations. The subsurface domain is divided into zones by k-means clustering on the inferred clay fractions and electrical resistivities. Hydraulic conductivities of the zones are estimated through hydrological model calibration using head and discharge observations. An ensemble of behavioral hydrostratigraphic models is sampled based on a threshold value of the objective function of the clustering algorithm, and goodness of fit to hydrological data. Hydrological predictions are capture zones and drawdown responses to pumping in areas of interest for management. Results will be shown for a Danish case study.",

            "abstract": "Olivine is the most abundant mineral in the Earth’s upper mantle. Studies on the elasticity of olivine attracted extensive research interests in the past few decades and have provided important constraints on the composition and structure of the Earth’s upper mantle. Of particular importance is the single-crystal elasticity of olivine which is essential for understanding the anisotropy structure of the upper mantle. However, previous experimental studies on the single-crystal elasticity of olivine are limited to high pressure and ambient temperature or high temperature and ambient pressure. Much of our current knowledge on the velocity and anisotropy structures of the upper mantle heavily relies on extrapolations of limited experimental results. Here, we have studied the single-crystal elasticity of San Carlos olivine, [(Mg0.9Fe0.1)2SiO4], up to 20 GPa and 900 K using Brillouin spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction in an externally-heated diamond anvil cell at GSECARS of the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. The simultaneously high pressure-temperature experiments allow us to investigate the combined effect of pressure and temperature on the velocity and anisotropy of olivine. These results have been applied to model the velocity structure, Vp and Vs anisotropy, Vp/Vs ratio, and Poisson’s ratio of the Earth’s upper mantle. Comparing the modeling results with seismic observations allow us to have a more comprehensive understanding on the velocity and anisotropy structure of the Earth’s upper mantle.",

            "abstract": "In 2013, a cruise on the USCGC Healy mapped the Beaufort margin from Barrow, AK into the Amundsen Gulf using a towed CHIRP subbottom profiler and a hull-mounted Knudsen CHIRP subbottom profiler. Sediment cores were also acquired. The seismic data image an extensive margin-wide drift deposit, which appears to have entered the Beaufort margin from the Mackenzie River. The deposit is thickest on the eastern side of the Mackenzie Delta, near stations 5 and 9. It thins west along the Beaufort margin nearing Barrow Canyon. The deposit also thins to the east, but does not extend as far in this direction. Sediment core Healy1302-JPC15, from station 5 on the Mackenzie slope, was analyzed for grain size using a Laser Diffraction Particle Size Analyzer. These data were compared to the magnetic susceptibility data from the core. Peaks in the susceptibility correlate with increases in grain size, as well as high amplitude reflectors within the drift deposit present in the seismic data. The drift deposit appears to have a diagnostic reflection pattern observed in the seismic data with the base being characterized by a high amplitude reflector that correlates with increased IRD. Above the basal reflectors, an acoustically transparent interval is observed with thicknesses on the order of 7 m near the depocenter; this interval has diminished IRD and radiocarbon dates yield accumulation rates as high as 8 m/ky. The dominant grain size for this interval is ~5 μm. Above the transparent interval is a series of high amplitude reflectors defining the top of the drift deposit. The dominant grain size for the basal and upper high amplitude reflectors reaches ~20 μm. We postulate that the drift deposit was sourced from glacial Lake Agassiz and flowed down the Mackenzie River, entering the Arctic Ocean. It was then entrained by the Beaufort Gyre, migrating clockwise along the margin. Oxygen isotope data reflects the light δO18 signature consistent with a large glacial meltwater input. Based on radiocarbon dates from the core, the flood deposit was laid down almost instantly in geologic time, starting ~13 kya. After the flood input, sedimentation rates were significantly lower, in the range of ~9 cm/ky in the late Holocene to ~120 cm/ky in the late Pleistocene. Prior to the flood, sedimentation rates were also lower at 133 cm/kyr.",

            "abstract": "Clumped isotope thermometry measures the formation temperature (T(Δ 47)) of authigenic carbonates at or near the Earth’s surface. Pedogenic carbonates are a common target for clumped isotope studies of paleoaltimetry and paleoclimate. However, the interpretation of T(Δ47) data from soil carbonates is limited by uncertainties in the timing and conditions responsible for carbonate formation. This study examines the potential for variability in soil temperatures at five soil pits in the summer-precipitation dominated eastern Andean piedmont. Four of the pits were excavated at ~1 km elevation over a ~ 40 km N-S transect between the Divisadero Largo Nature Reserve and the Villavicencio Nature Reserve in Argentina’s Mendoza Province (~33⁰S). The substrate for each soil pit is coarse-grained conglomerate. Vegetation at each of these sites is dominated by C3 plants including genus Larrea shrubs (creosote bush), cactus and grasses. Three of the pits were instrumented with soil temperature and soil moisture sensors to a depth of 1 m. The fifth pit, at an elevation of 0.6 km and 34°S in the Nacuñan Nature Reserve, lies in a mixed C3/C4 vegetation environment that is dominated by C4 grass biomass. This site was sampled to 1 m depth and instrumented with both soil (moisture, temperature and CO2 concentration) and atmospheric sensors (temperature, relative humidity, insolation and rainfall amount).\nMeasured carbonate δ18O values at all sites exhibit a decrease with depth, indicating undisturbed soil profiles. Consistent with a previous study on the eastern flank of the Andes, average T(Δ47) values for all sampled pits were found to vary little with depth. The mean T(Δ47) value for the N-S transect bordering the mountains is 32°C ± 3°C (± 1SE). T(Δ47) for the Nacuñan pit is 30°C ± 3°C. These temperatures are 10°C higher than those previously reported from a 1 m pit at 1.1 km in the nearby Río Mendoza valley. This suggests the potential for substantial variability in T(Δ47) at the same elevation for a region dominated by a single precipitation and vegetation regime and elevation. The invariance of temperatures with depth suggests that carbonate formation occurs in the spring or fall when the soil profile is near isothermal, or that some other temperature dependent process controls carbonate formation in semi-arid desert soils.",

            "abstract": "The general lack of information concerning karst conduit network geometry is a crucial problem for the management of karst aquifers. Many prior studies have used a variety of statistical and physics-based approaches to understand relationships between aquifer structure and the variations in discharge, chemistry, and temperature observed at karst springs. In particular, previous work has shown that temperature signals at karst springs contain substantial information about the flow network and modes of recharge. Thermal pulses have also been fit to numerical transport simulations to constrain conduit diameter. The peaks of temperature curves observed at multiple points along a flow path are sometimes employed to estimate flow-through time. However, thermal peaks exhibit retardation as a result of heat exchange between the water and conduit wall. Here, we demonstrate that the retardation and damping of a thermal pulse are simple functions of conduit properties, notably diameter. We derive analytical solutions for a sinusoidal input temperature, and use numerical simulations to demonstrate that these solutions can be used to estimate damping and retardation of single pulses with many of the underlying assumptions of the analytical solutions relaxed. These analytical relationships can be used as a simple means to extract rough information about conduit geometry using the retardation or damping of a thermal peak. We demonstrate how this technique can be used with a field example. Additionally, we use the analytical relation for retardation to provide constraints on the use of temperature as an indicator of flow-through time.",

            "abstract": "The 2013 floods across southern Alberta, Canada, are considered to be one of the worst natural disasters in recent Canadian history. This region is highly vulnerable to flooding during spring as the frozen ground restricts infiltration and the melting snow directly contributes to streamflow. Studies have concluded that the 2013 floods in Alberta were a result of heavier snowpack from winter precipitation and higher amounts of spring precipitation as rain over the eastern slopes of the Rockies. Although this flood is considered to be less than the 100-year flood of the region, the effects were economically devastating. The return periods of floods are generally determined under the assumption that the annual peak flow series are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). However, researchers have demonstrated that this assumption is not valid in Australia and that the i.i.d. assumption can lead to under- or over-estimation of the true long-term flood risk. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) have a strong impact on western Canadian hydroclimate via teleconnections. The negative phase of the PDO and La Niña typically produce heavier snowpack across the prairies compared to that during the positive phase of PDO and El Niño. In this study, we explore the connections between the PDO, ENSO and the peak annual streamflow in southwestern Canadian prairie rivers. Daily averaged annual peak flow records from 22 rivers were stratified according to the PDO phases and ENSO states and fit to the Log-Pearson III (LP3) distribution. We determined that the flood risk is significantly higher in the negative phase of the PDO and is enhanced during La Niña episodes within the negative PDO phase. To ensure these results were not due to sampling error or unequal record lengths, a regional index approach was also employed, which confirmed these results. Our results are important for the optimal planning and design of flood control structures, transportation infrastructure, and water distribution systems, etc.",

The wind curl generated by the island blocking of the trade winds is known to give rise to ocean eddies; however, the impact of the sea surface temperature (SST) and velocity fronts associated with these eddies on the atmosphere is less understood. The main coupling mechanisms are: (i) changes in the near-surface stability and surface stress, (ii) vertical transfer of momentum from higher atmospheric levels to the ocean surface due to an increase of the turbulence in the boundary layer, (iii) secondary circulations associated with perturbations in the surface atmospheric pressure over the SST fronts, and (iv) the impact of the oceanic eddy currents on the net momentum transferred between the atmosphere and the ocean. To assess the relative contribution from each process, a coupled simulation between the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) models is conducted for the main Hawaiian Islands. The impact of the coupling, the perturbation of the mean wind pattern, and the different spatial scales involved in the air-sea exchanges of momentum and heat are explored.",

            "abstract": "Climate and tectonics are primary controls on bedrock erosion, and sediment production, transport, and deposition. Additionally, silicate weathering in tectonically active regions is known to play a significant role in global climate owing to the high rates of physical erosion and exposure of unweathered bedrock to chemical weathering, which removes CO2 from the atmosphere. Therefore, the feedback between weathering and climate is key to understanding climate change through Earth history. This study investigates chemical and physical weathering of alluvial sediments in the Anza-Borrego Desert, California, located in the southern part of the San Andreas Fault System. This setting provides an ideal opportunity to study weathering in a hot and arid climate with mean annual temperatures of ~23 °C and mean annual precipitation of ~160 mm in the basin. Samples were collected along a proximal-to-distal transect of an alluvial-fan system sourced exclusively from Cretaceous tonalite of the Peninsular Range. The single bedrock lithology enables exploration of the effects of other variables — climate, transport distance, drainage area, and tectonics— on the physical and chemical properties of the sediments. Although minimal overall (CIA = 56-61), the degree of chemical weathering increases down transect, dominated by plagioclase dissolution. BET surface area of the mud (<63µm) fraction decreases distally, which is consistent with coarsening grain-size. Chemical alteration and BET surface area both increase in a distal region, within the active Elsinore Fault zone. Extensive fracturing here, together with a more-humid Pleistocene climate likely facilitated in-situ bedrock weathering; specifically, dissolution of primary minerals (e.g. plagioclase), preceding the arid alluvial erosion, transport, and deposition in the Holocene. This study further seeks to disentangle the complex record of the climate and tectonic signals imprinted in these sediments.",

            "abstract": "Radar is a remote sensor used for scientific, meteorological, and military applications. Radar waves are affected by the medium through which they propagate, impacting the accuracy of radar measurements. Thus, environmental effects should be understood and quantified. The marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) is highly dynamic and turbulent, and affects radar wave propagation. The ocean surface roughness impacts scattering behavior. These effects cause variability in constructive and destructive interference patterns due to reflection from the ocean surface, known as multipath. The atmospheric effects cause radar waves to attenuate and refract; this study focuses on the refractive effects. A high-fidelity, physics-based, parabolic wave equation simulation is used to model the radar propagation and accounts for effects of the rough ocean surface (wind seas and swell) as well as variable refractivity with height and range. We use a robust, variance based, sensitivity analysis method called the Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test to quantify which environmental parameters have the most significant effect on the modeled radar wave propagation. In this sensitivity study, the environment is parameterized by 16 variables, 8 ocean surface and 8 atmospheric. Sensitivity analysis is performed for 3 radar frequencies (3, 9, and 15 GHz) and 2 polarizations (horizontal and vertical). Results indicate that radar wave propagation is more sensitive to atmospheric parameters than ocean surface parameters. The mixed layer has the most far-reaching effect over the entire model domain (a range of 60 km and altitudes up to 1 km), characterized by its height and refractivity gradient. The remaining important factors have a predominantly local effect in the region where they occur in the MABL atmospheric structure. At low altitudes, radar wave propagation power is most sensitive to the gradient and curvature of the vertical refractivity profile. This research provides insight into which aspects of the environment would need to be known with high accuracy to enable corrections for these environmental effects.",

            "abstract": "The release of HONO from snow in remote polar regions has been known for many years. HONO in the snow is likely formed through chemical processes initiated by the photolysis of nitrate in the snowpack. This source has recently also been invoked to explain high ozone levels observed at wintertime gas-drilling locations. The release of HONO from snowpack would be enhanced in oil and gas fields, where emissions of NOx are significant, thus serving as an important OH precursor and driver of ozone formation.\nHere we present observations of gradients of HONO mixing ratios using the UCLA LP-DOAS instrument during the Uintah Basin Winter Ozone Studies (UBWOS) in 2012 and 2014. HONO levels were measured at about 25, 45, and 65 m above the ground level. The lack of snow during UBWS 2012 compared to the snowy 2014 conditions allows us to directly study the influence of snow cover on HONO chemistry. Preliminary results show that HONO mixing ratios were comparable during both years, with nighttime hourly averages ranging from 60 ppt to 120ppt and daytime hourly averages close to 50ppt. However, during the snow covered year, we observed a significant peak of HONO (up to 100 ppt in the lowest light path) around 13:00 local time. During this time, a strong HONO vertical gradient was also observed. We will discuss the possible daytime HONO sources responsible for these observations and investigate the role of snow in HONO formation in a polluted environment",

            "abstract": "In this study we evaluate the skill of WRF model to simulate the actual diurnal cycle of convection in the Amazon basin. Models tipically are not capable to simulate the well documented cycle of 1) shallow cumulus in the morning; 2) towering process around noon; 3) shallow-to-deep convection and rain around 14h (LT). The fail in models is explained by the typical size of shallow cumulus (~0.5 – 2.0 km) and the coarse resolution of models using convection parameterisation (> 20 km). In this study we employed high spatial resolution (Dx = 0.625 km) to reach the shallow cumulus scale. . The simulations corresponds to a dynamical downscaling of ERA-Interim from 25 to 28 February 2013 with 40 vertical levels, 30 minutes outputs,and three nested grids (10 km, 2.5 km, 0.625 km). Improved vegetation (USGS + PROVEG), albedo and greenfrac (computed from MODIS-NDVI + LEAF-2 land surface parameterization), as well as pseudo analysis of soil moisture were used as input data sets, resulting in more realistic precipitation fields when compared to observations in sensitivity tests. Convective parameterization was switched off for the 2.5/0.625 km grids, where cloud formation was solely resolved by the microphysics module (WSM6 scheme, which provided better results). Results showed a significant improved capability of the model to simulate diurnal cycle. Shallow cumulus begin to appear in the first hours in the morning. They were followed by a towering process that culminates with precipitation in the early afternoon, which is a behavior well described by observations but rarely obtained in models. Rain volumes were also realistic (~20 mm for single events) when compared to typical events during the period, which is in the core of the wet season. Cloud fields evolution also differed with respect to Amazonas River bank, which is a clear evidence of the interaction between river breeze and large scale circulation.",

            "abstract": "Emissions from fires in the Western US are substantial and can impact air quality and regional climate. Many methods exist that estimate the particulate and gaseous emissions from fires, including those run operationally for use with chemical forecast models. The US Forest Service Smartfire2/BlueSky modeling framework uses satellite data and reported information about fire perimeters to estimate emissions of pollutants to the atmosphere. The emission estimates are used as inputs to dispersion models, such as HYSPLIT, and chemical transport models, such as CMAQ and WRF-Chem, to assess the chemical and physical impacts of fires on the atmosphere. Here we investigate the use of Smartfire2/BlueSky and WRF-Chem to simulate emissions from the 2013 fire summer fire season, with special focus on the Rim Fire in northern California. The 2013 Rim Fire ignited on August 17 and eventually burned more than 250,000 total acres before being contained on October 24. Large smoke plumes and pyro-convection events were observed. In this study, the Smartfire2/BlueSky operational emission estimates are compared to other estimation methods, such as the Fire INventory from NCAR (FINN) and other global databases to quantify variations in emission estimation methods for this wildfire event. The impact of the emissions on downwind chemical composition is investigated with the coupled meteorology-chemistry WRF-Chem model. The inclusion of aerosol-cloud and aerosol-radiation interactions in the model framework enables the evaluation of the downwind impacts of the fire plume. The emissions and modeled chemistry can also be evaluated with data collected from the Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC4RS) aircraft field campaign, which intersected the fire plume.",

            "abstract": "Geomicrobial rates, rates of microbial metabolism in natural environments, are a key parameter of theoretical and practical problems in geobiology and biogeochemistry. Both laboratory- and field-based approaches have been applied to study rates of geomicrobial processes. Laboratory-based approaches analyze geomicrobial kinetics by incubating environmental samples under controlled laboratory conditions. Field methods quantify geomicrobial rates by observing the progress of geomicrobial processes. To take advantage of recent development in biogeochemical modeling and genome-scale metabolic modeling, we suggest that geomicrobial rates can also be predicted by simulating metabolic reaction networks of microbes.\nTo predict geomicrobial rates, we developed a genome-scale metabolic model that describes enzyme reaction networks of microbial metabolism, and simulated the network model by accounting for the kinetics and thermodynamics of enzyme reactions. The model is simulated numerically to solve cellular enzyme abundance and hence metabolic rates under the constraints of cellular physiology. The new modeling approach differs from flux balance analysis of system biology in that it accounts for the thermodynamics and kinetics of enzymatic reactions. It builds on subcellular metabolic reaction networks, and hence also differs from classical biogeochemical reaction modeling.\nWe applied the new approach to Methanosarcina acetivorans, an anaerobic, marine methanogen capable of disproportionating acetate to carbon dioxide and methane. The input of the new model includes (1) enzyme reaction network of acetoclastic methanogenesis, and (2) representative geochemical conditions of freshwater sedimentary environments. The output of the simulation includes the proteomics, metabolomics, and energy and matter fluxes of M. acetivorans. Our simulation results demonstrate the predictive power of the new modeling approach. Specifically, the results illustrate how methanogenesis rates vary with acetate concentrations and the energy available in the environment, and how M. acetivorans regulate the enzymes of methanogenesis under different biogeochemical conditions.",

            "abstract": "Recognizing the fact that we are living in a constantly changing world became actual during the last decades, and promoted numerous studies related to the environmental consequences of climate change and human impact. In this context, the study of human- and naturally-triggered palaeoenvironmental changes leads to a better understanding of possible changes during the future. Human impact became progressively important during the last millenia, and caused dramatic changes of the natural environment especially in fragile landscapes.\nThe semi-arid Gareja region in the Iori Highland in the eastern part of the Republic of Georgia is characterized by an annual precipitation < 600 mm and shows an open steppic landscape today. As is known from historical sources, the landscape showed the same character already during the 6th century AD when the Gareja monastery located in the center of the region was founded by Assyrian monks. However, archaeological research carried out during the Soviet Period showed the existence of numerous settlements of bronze and iron age in this region almost devoid of water resources today, hinting to some sources of fresh water allowing people to live there during those periods. Furthermore, former archaeo-botanical studies assume that the region was covered by forests instead of steppes during the past, although there is no final proof yet.\nThe goal of this study is to shed light on the development of the Gareja landscape during the prehistoric period and thus to address some of the issues described above. To do so, our work is based on the spatial pattern of prehistoric settlements derived from archaeologic data of the Soviet period, GIS stream modelling and the analysis of fluvial and slope deposits from the area using a multi-proxy approach. Altogether, these data indicate a dramatic palaeoenvironmental change in the Gareja region ca. 3 ka ago, leading to the recent steppe and almost unpopulated character of the landscape.",

            "abstract": "The Enceladus ice/vapor plume not only accounts for the various features observed in the Saturnian system, such as the E-ring, the narrow neutral H2O torus, and Enceladus’ own bright albedo, but also raises exciting new possibilities, including the existence of liquid water on Enceladus. Therefore, understanding the plume and its physics is important. Here we assume that the plume arises from flow expansion within multiple narrow subsurface cracks connected to reservoirs of liquid water underground, and simulate this expanding flow from the underground reservoir out to several Enceladus radii where Cassini data are available for comparison. The direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method is used to simulate the subsurface and near-field collisional regions and a free-molecular model is used to propagate the plume out into the far-field. We include the following physical processes in our simulations: the flow interaction with the crack walls, grain condensation from the vapor phase, non-equilibrium effects (e.g. freezing of molecular internal energy modes), the interaction between the vapor and the ice grains, the gravitational fields of Enceladus and Saturn, and Coriolis and centrifugal forces (due to motion in non-inertial reference frame). The end result is a plume model that includes the relevant physics of the flow from the underground source out to where Cassini measurements are taken. We have made certain assumptions about the channel geometry and reservoir conditions. The model is constrained using various available Cassini data (particularly those of INMS, CDA and UVIS) to understand the plume physics as well as estimate the vapor and grain production rates and its temporal variability.",

            "abstract": "In the second half of July we completed the iMUSH active source seismic experiment, one component of the Imaging Magma Under Saint Helens project. A team of ~75 volunteers deployed 3500 seismographs to ~5920 locations on and around Mount St. Helens over the course of 3 weeks. This instrument deployment was accompanied by 23 shots distributed around the volcano. Instrumentation consisted of ~2550 Reftek 125A (Texan) seismographs with 4.5 Hz geophones, and 920 Nodal Seismic recorders with 10 Hz geophones. The shots were also recorded by the permanent stations of the Pacific Northwest Seismograph Network and 70 iMUSH broadband seismographs. Fifteen of the shots, 424 kg each, formed two rings around Mount Saint Helens at 15 km and 30 km radius from the summit. Eight of the shots, 828 kg each, were fired at distances of 50 to 80 km from MSH on NW-SE and NE-SW azimuths.\nThe deployment geometry consisted of two lines oriented NW/SE and NE/SW, and three arrays. The offset of the lines ranged from 150 km to 190 km with an average spacing of 200 m. The first array was centered on the volcano with a radius of 30 km, and required both driving and hiking to deploy. Arrays two and three were set out with, and centered on, the NW/SE line. These arrays had a distance range from MSH of 30-75 km and an azimuth range of about 100 degrees. In addition to this large-scale deployment, we set out 7 beamforming arrays approximately collocated with iMUSH broadband seismographs, and above clusters of seismicity in the region. The aperture of these arrays was about 1 km with an instrument spacing of 100 m.\nThe final deployment ended only days before the AGU abstract deadline, so we have not yet examined all of the data. However, the preliminary indications are that signal to noise is excellent: The shots, several of which registered on PNSN as ML>2.1, carried across the entire array, and were recorded as far away as Seattle and Corvallis on permanent stations. The array also recorded a number of local and regional earthquakes, and micro-seismicity at 3-4 km depth beneath the MSH summit.\nFigure Caption: Blue dots are ~2500 Texan locations for the first deployment, which recorded 15 shots (blue stars). Red are ~2570 Texan locations for the second deployment, which recorded 8 shots (red stars). Purple are ~920 Nodal Seismic seismographs which recorded all the shots.",

            "abstract": "As survey costs continue to plummet and storage capabilities soar, large-scale multitemporal airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) surveys for high-resolution snow depth measurements are becoming commonplace in mountain research watersheds. Though there are disadvantages to the technique (e.g. poor temporal representation and high uncertainty in steep terrain and dense vegetation), the wealth of information with regard to previously unknown spatial snow depth distributions can be an valuable tool for assessing spatially distributed operational snow models. As a portion of NASA’s second Cold Lands Processes Experiment (CLPX-2), two 750-km2 LiDAR surveys were conducted over Northern Colorado in December and February of the 2006/2007 winter season. The resulting 5-m gridded changes in snow depth overlay 980 individual pixels of the SNOw Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) spatial framework. As an important operational snow model developed by NOAA’s National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center (NOHRSC), SNODAS generally lacks independent validation datasets due to the data assimilation step critical for adjusting the energy balance and downscaled Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model components. The influence of sub-grid variability on SNODAS performance is assessed using the independent high resolution CLPX-2 LiDAR changes in snow depth. This method provides a foundation for further studies to quantitatively address the affect of small-scale physiographic variables on various large-scale operational snow models by making use of forthcoming large-scale LiDAR datasets.",

            "abstract": "A combination of continuous and campaign style geodetic measurements from sites on the South Island of New Zealand help us to constrain long-term and short-term deformation adjacent to the Puysegur subduction zone, offshore Fiordland, New Zealand. We update an elastic block model for the region that consists of an array of microplates bounded by active faults. We invert GPS velocities, and long-term fault slip rates and earthquake slip vectors for tectonic block rotations, fault coupling coefficients, and permanent block strain. Three large subduction interface earthquakes, 2003 Secretary Island (Mw 7.2), 2007 George Sound (Mw 6.7), and 2009 Dusky Sound (Mw 7.8) complicate interpretation of the GPS time series over the last decade in the Fiordland region. To deal with this, we also conduct time-dependent inversions for coseismic and postseismic slip in those earthquakes using TDefnode (McCaffrey, 2009), fitting the campaign and continuous GPS timeseries with the best-fitting coseismic and postseismic slip models for those events. We evaluate the interseismic coupling model for the Puysegur subduction zone in the context of the recent earthquakes, and in particular find that the source region of the Mw 7.8 Dusky Sound earthquake was interseismically coupled prior to 2009. Overall, the campaign and continuous GPS are well-fit by a partially locked subduction interface undergoing seismic and aseismic slip as well as distributed (likely permanent) deformation east of the main plate boundary fault.",

Both case studies and ensemble means are used to investigate aerosol-DCC interactions. We identify a few scenarios where possible signal of aerosol effect on DCC may be extracted. The results show a consistent and physically sound picture of aerosols affecting DCC microphysics as well as macrophysical properties. Specifically, pollutions and smokes are shown to consistently decrease ice particle size. On the contrary, dust particles close to source regions are shown to make cloud ice particle size more maritime like. We postulate that dust may achieve this by acting as either heterogeneous ice nuclei or giant cloud condensation nuclei. This contrast between smoke or pollution and dust also exists for their effects on cloud glaciation temperature. Smoke and pollution aerosols are shown to decrease glaciation temperature while dust particles do the opposite. Possible Implications of our results for studying aerosol indirect forcing, cirrus cloud properties, troposphere-stratosphere water vapor exchange and cloud latent heating are discussed.",

            "abstract": " Blowout dunes are a primary mechanism for transporting sand within vegetated coastal dune systems. Understanding the fine-scale variation in sediment transport within these systems is critical to predicting their formation and migration. Previous investigations of a coastal dune system located at the Bodega Marine Reserve, on the Sonoma Coast of Northern California have indicated that aeolian sand flux in unvegetated sand is ~450x greater than in vegetated areas. To better understand sand flux and its relationship with wind speed, direction and precipitation, we deployed an array of 12 sand traps within a single blowout area adjacent to the BOON marine climatology station. The blowout is trough- shaped, approximately 50 meters long and 15 meters wide. Its main 'fairway' is 5-10 meters below the surrounding beach grass (Ammophila)-covered land surface. Surface sediment within the blowout is fine-grained to granule-sized lithic to sub-lithic sand, and is coarsest in the center. Dune sediment in the Bodega Marine Reserve has been transported by aeolian processes from Salmon Creek Beach to the NW. Within the blowout, typical bedforms include 15-25 cm-wavelength, ~10 cm high sinuous to lingoid ripples arranged perpendicularly to the dominant wind direction (~280 degrees). An 8-10 meter-high mound at the downwind end has accumulated due to the trapping of sand flux by vegetation. Sediment flux across the studied blowout was sampled monthly over a 10-month period of 2013-2014. Sand traps were constructed using modified PVC cylinders, and are 0.5 meter high and 0.3 meter in diameter, with a 0.74-micron mesh screen. Based on measured sand flux, the sites can be categorized into three groups-axial, medial, and peripheral. Rates increase downwind within the blowout. Inter-site sand flux variability within unvegetated locations of the blowout is greater than two orders of magnitude. Axial sites, which experience the greatest sand flux, occur on the edge of the blowout adjacent to an older 10 meter-high dune that is currently being eroded. Peripheral sites occur near the margins of the blowout. Based on all of the available information, we find sand flux is strongly influenced by local topographic features and the upwind configuration of transport-prone surfaces, and is poorly predicted by regional wind vectors and grain sizes.",

            "abstract": "The 1960 M9.5 Valdivia and 1964 M9.2 Alaska megathrust earthquakes caused a zone of secondary coseismic uplift a few hundred kilometers landward of the trench. The secondary uplift exceeds 1m in Valdivia and 0.3m in Alaska. Its universal occurrence during other earthquakes as well as the physical mechanisms governing this process remain unclear, although several mechanisms have been proposed in the last century.\nWe combined survey data from these megathrust earthquakes in the last century with recent high-quality GPS data recorded during the 2010 M8.8 Maule and 2011 M9.0 Tohoku-Oki megathrust earthquakes (Figure 1). Based on these natural observations, we confirm the existence of a zone of secondary uplift in all earthquakes studied and discuss the similarities and differences between them. Dip and curvature of the slab and overriding plate structure seem to influence the amplitude of this phenomenon as well as the location of the transition from subsidence to secondary uplift. This transition ranges from 200 km distance to the trench up to 500 km. The amplitude of the secondary zone of uplift scales with the size of the earthquakes.\nUsing numerical seismo-thermo-mechanical modeling, we identified the low-viscosity lower crust as a crucial factor. A weak viscous lower crust does not accumulate significant stresses and allows for the bending and elastic buckling of a thin and strong elastic upper crust. The amplitude and relative position of the secondary zone of uplift also depends on the interplate decoupling depth as well as the shear modulus and thickness of the upper crust.\nIn conclusion, a secondary zone of coseismic uplift due to megathrust earthquakes exists and it is mainly controlled by the difference between a rheologically strong elastic upper and weak ductile lower crust. Since a weaker lower crust is observed to affect surface displacements distinctly, ignoring this feature will have a profound impact on the estimated slip on the interface. Therefore we suggest including this unequivocal feature in geodetic-based source inversions, especially for settings with a warm, continental overriding plate.",

            "abstract": "Darkened glacier and ice sheet surfaces have lower albedos, absorb more solar radiation and consequently melt more rapidly. The increase in glacier surface darkening is an important positive feedback to warming global temperatures, leading to ever growing world-wide ice mass loss. Most studies focus primarily on glacial albedo darkening caused by the physical properties of snow and ice surfaces, and the deposition of dark impurities on glaciers. To date, however, the important effects of biological activity have not been included in most albedo reduction models. This study provides the first experimental evidence that microbial activity can significantly decrease the albedo of glacier surfaces. An original laboratory experiment, the cryoconite casserole, was designed to test the microbial darkening of glacier surface debris (cryoconite) under simulated Greenlandic summer conditions. It was found that minor fertilisation of the cryoconite (at nutrient concentrations typical of glacial ice melt) stimulated extensive microbial activity. Microbes intensified their organic carbon fixation and even mined phosphorous out of the glacier surface sediment. Furthermore, the microbial organic carbon production, accumulation and transformation caused the glacial debris to darken further by 17.3% reflectivity (albedo analogue). These experiments are consistent with the hypothesis that enhanced fertilisation by anthropogenic inputs results in substantial amounts of organic carbon fixation, debris darkening and ultimately to a considerable decrease in the ice albedo of glacier surfaces on global scales. The sizeable amounts of microbially produced glacier surface organic matter and nutrients can thus be a vital source of bioavailable nutrients for subglacial and downstream environments.",

            "abstract": "Several modeling approaches have been developed in the literature for simulating solute transport at the pore scale. This includes “direct modeling” where the fundamental equations are solved directly on the actual pore-scale geometry (obtained from digital images). These methods, even though very accurate, come at a high computational cost. A pore-network representation of the pore-scale geometry is a first step in reducing the computational cost. However, the geometric simplification is typically accompanied by a secondary simplification of the physics of the problem (contributing to their inaccuracy). This is seen in the widely-used “mixed-cell method” which has simplifications in two key components: 1) intra-pore mixing, and 2) inter-pore rate expressions. Nevertheless, the method is popular because it is computationally inexpensive, allowing for examining larger and more representative computational domains.\nIn this work, we explore two novel methods for circumventing the aforementioned limitations of the mixed-cell method (intra-pore mixing and inter-pore rate expressions); all while making an effort to keep the computational cost low. We show that while intra-pore mixing can be accurately taken into account, correcting for the inter-pore rate expressions has fundamental implications on the applicability of Eulerian pore-network models and the interpretation of the results obtained therefrom. Despite recent important progress in the development of accurate and robust direct modeling tools, there is a need in the literature for simple, accurate, and inexpensive models both from a scientific as well as a practical point of view.",

Our study focuses on the East and West Coast of the US during the 2012 TCAP (Two Column Aerosol Project) summer and the 2013 SEAC4RS (Studies of Emissions, Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys) campaigns. We define two main receptor regions: (1) ocean-column offshore of Cape-Cod during TCAP and (2) downwind area from Yosemite Rim fires over Nevada and Idaho during SEAC4RS. For each region, we perform forward trajectory simulations from two major emission sources - fires and urban/industrial centers - using FLEXPART Lagrangian analysis driven by WRF meteorology to assign their relative importance. We then compare WRF-Chem simulated column AOD, extinction profiles and ozone amounts for each receptor area with the airborne measurements made by the 4STAR (Spectrometer for Sky-Scanning, Sun-Tracking Atmospheric Research), as well as with space-borne measurement by MODIS and OMI. Finally, we investigate differences in total AOD, vertical distributions (when available), and ozone levels as they relate to source attribution, spatial averaging, and to modeling and measurement uncertainties.",

            "abstract": "The lunar regolith is derived from impact ejecta, and so understanding ejecta characteristics is a key element of regolith studies. Here we report on the physical properties of impact ejecta from Earth-based and orbital radar (Arecibo / Green Bank telescopes at 12.6- and 70-cm wavelengths, and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Mini-RF) and LRO Diviner thermal infrared observations. Diviner thermal IR data provide estimates of surface rock abundance, and the radar datasets reveal rocks buried beneath up to several meters of regolith. These four datasets represent a spectrum of observational wavelengths, and their intercomparison provides a means of constraining both ejecta block content and depth extent. We examine all craters on the lunar nearside that show evidence for blocky ejecta, whether buried or on the surface, in order to investigate spatial, crater size-, and time-dependent variations in ejecta block size distribution and spatial extent. Previous work has shown that it is possible to quantify the relationship between surface ejecta rock content and crater age for craters younger than ~1 Gyr; we will now present the results of our effort to extend the age range over which this relationship can be applied by investigating buried ejecta as well. Further, we report on the thermophysical characteristics of distal fine-grained ejecta that have previously been shown to exhibit unique radar characteristics (low radar return and circular polarization ratio). Our results constrain the physical properties of ejecta, and variations in those properties with time and depth, to an extent not possible from examination of visible-wavelength images and multispectral data alone.",

            "abstract": "Presenting Quaternary Environmental Change to students who fall into Widening Participation criteria at the University of Cambridge, gives a unique opportunity to present academic debate in an approachable and entertaining way. Literally by discussing the melting of our ice caps, melts the divide Cambridge has between its reputation and the reality for the brightest, underprivileged, students. There is a balance between presenting cutting edge research with the need to come across as accessible (and importantly valuable to “learning”). Climate change over the Quaternary lends itself well to this aim. By lecturing groups of potential students through the entire Quaternary in an hour, stopping to discuss how our ancestors interacted with past Interglacials and what are the mechanisms driving change (in generalized terms), you are able to introduce cutting edge research (such as the latest NEEM ice core) to the students. This shows the evolution and importance of higher education and academic research. The lecture leads well onto group discussions (termed “supervisions” in Cambridge), to explore their opinions on the concern for present Anthropogenic Climate Change in relation to Past Climate Change after being presented with images that our ancestors “made it”. Here discussion thrives off students saying obvious things (or sarcastic comments!) which quickly can lead into a deep technical discussion on their terms. Such discussions give the students a zest for higher education, simply throwing Ruddiman’s (2003) “The Anthroprocene Started Several Thousand Years Ago” at them, questions in a second their concept of Anthropogenic Climate Change. Supervisions lend themselves well to bright, articulate, students and by offering these experiences to students of Widening Participation criteria we quickly melt the divide between the reputation of Cambridge ( and higher education as a whole) and the day to day practice. Higher education is not for the privileged, but a free and open environment for the exchange of ideas. Quaternary Environmental Change lends itself, as an engaging and “fun” subject, well to potential students bridging the divide between ability and circumstance.",

            "abstract": "The Kilauea volcano, Hawaii Island, is one of the most active volcanoes worldwide. Its complex system including magma reservoirs and rift zones, provides a unique opportunity to investigate the dynamics of magma transport and supply. The relatively shallow magma reservoir beneath the caldera stores magma prior to eruption at the caldera or migration to the rift zones. Additionally, the temporally variable pressure in the magma reservoir causes changes in the stress field, driving dike propagation and occasional intrusions at the eastern rift zone. Thus constraining the time-dependent evolution of the magma reservoir plays an important role in understanding magma processes such as supply, storage, transport and eruption.\nThe recent development of space-based monitoring technology, InSAR (Interferometric synthetic aperture radar), allows the detection of subtle deformation of the surface at high spatial resolution and accuracy. In order to understand the dynamics of the magma chamber at Kilauea summit area and the associated stress field, we explored SAR data sets acquired in two overlapping tracks of Envisat SAR data during period 2003-2010. The combined InSAR time series includes 100 samples measuring summit deformation at unprecedented spatiotemporal resolutions. To investigate the source of the summit deformation field, we propose a novel time-dependent inverse modelling approach to constrain the dynamics of the reservoir volume change within the summit magma reservoir in three dimensions. In conjunction with seismic and gas data sets, the obtained time-dependent model could resolve the temporally variable relation between shallow and deep reservoirs, as well as their connection to the rift zone via stress changes. The data and model improve the understanding of the Kilauea plumbing system, physics of eruptions, mechanics of rift intrusions, and enhance eruption forecast models.",

            "abstract": "In 2015, NOAA's RISA program will celebrate its 20th year of exploration in the development of usable climate information. In the mid-1990s, a vision emerged to develop interdisciplinary research efforts at the regional scale for several important reasons. Recognizable climate patterns, such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), emerge at the regional level where our understanding of observations and models coalesce. Critical resources for society are managed in a context of regional systems, such as water supply and human populations. Multiple scales of governance (local, state, and federal) with complex institutional relationships can be examined across a region. Climate information (i.e. data, science, research etc) developed within these contexts has greater potential for use.\nAll of this work rests on a foundation of iterative engagement between scientists and decision makers. Throughout these interactions, RISAs have navigated diverse politics, extreme events and disasters, socio-economic and ecological disruptions, and advances in both science and technology. Our understanding of information needs is evolving into a richer understanding of complex institutional, legal, political, and cultural contexts within which people can use science to make informed decisions. The outcome of RISA work includes both cases where climate information was used in decisions and cases where capacity for using climate information and making climate resilient decisions has increased over time. In addition to balancing supply and demand of scientific information, RISAs are engaged in a social process of reconciling climate information use with important drivers of society.\nBecause partnerships are critical for sustained engagement, and because engagement is critically important to the use of science, the rapid development of new capacity in regionally-based science programs focused on providing climate decision support is both needed and challenging. New actors can bolster existing partnerships, but also impact trust developed through engagement. Examining other partnership-driven science initiatives, such as Digital Coast or NIDIS, can help identify critical elements of governance and network management that could be applied to the regional climate programs.",

Very little information on their historical fluctuations exists as much of the focus has been on the Greenland Ice Sheet. Now, we can for the first time present historic data that spans 110 years for more than 200 of the local glaciers and ice caps covering this large and important region of the Arctic.\nThe central- and north eastern part of Greenland is of particular interest as these areas are predicted to exhibit a more active behavior with higher mass loss in the future - simultaneously with an increase in precipitation. Our results show that the glaciers and ice caps in the region are responding very rapidly to changes in temperature and precipitation. The present retreat is the fastest observed within the last eight decades, only surpassed by the rapid post LIA retreat.\nThe 1930s was the golden era for scientific exploration in Central- and North East Greenland as several large expeditions visited the area and photographed from land, sea and air. We use historic recordings from Danish and Norwegian aerial missions and terrestrial recordings from the renowned American Explorer Louise Boyd. These unique pictures from the early 1930s form the backbone of the study and are supplemented the more recent aerial photographs the 1940s and onwards and satellite imagery from the mid-1960s and up until present. From high resolution aerial photographs we are able to map the maximum extent of the glaciers during the LIA (Little Ice Age), from which retreat in this area is estimated to commence in 1900. Using a new SMB (Surface Mass Balance) model and its components covering the entire observational period along with high resolution DEMs and historic sea-ice records we are now able to extract valuable information on the past and present triggers of glacial change.",

Because ice and liquid phase clouds have very different scattering and absorbing properties, an incorrect cloud phase decision can lead to substantial uncertainties in the cloud optical and microphysical property products such as cloud optical thickness or effective particle radius. Furthermore, it is well-established that ice and liquid clouds have different impacts on the Earth's energy budget and hydrological cycle, thus accurately monitoring the spatial and temporal distribution of these clouds is of continued importance.\nFor MODIS Collection 6 (C6), the shortwave-derived cloud thermodynamic phase algorithm used by the optical and microphysical property retrievals has been completely rewritten to improve the phase discrimination skill for a variety of cloudy scenes (e.g., thin/thick clouds, over ocean/land/desert/snow/ice surface, etc). To evaluate the performance of the C6 cloud phase algorithm, extensive granule-level and global comparisons have been conducted against the heritage C5 algorithm, CALIOP, and POLDER. A wholesale improvement is seen for C6 compared to C5. We will present an overview of the MODIS C6 cloud phase algorithm updates and their impacts on cloud retrieval statistics, as well as ongoing efforts to continue algorithm improvement.",

            "abstract": "The wintertime weather in the northern North Atlantic sector is characterized by a succession of intense storms and blocking distortions of the jet stream which cause strong surface fluxes and wind-driven forces. This is also a region of strong oceanic advection of heat northward from the Atlantic into the Nordic Seas and Arctic Ocean. In this study we examine year to year variations in these surface exchanges and advective contributions through analysis of 14 CMIP5 coupled climate models. All models exhibit decadal ocean variability of Nordic Seas that is comparable in amplitude and timescale to observations. However, the roles of heat advection and surface fluxes in producing this variability are different: some models are heat flux controlled models, while others are advection controlled. We find that the frequency of wintertime blocking events over Greenland is closely linked to these differences. Models with low event frequencies have ocean variability which is mainly flux-driven, while models with high event frequencies, have oceans in which ocean advection is key. Low frequency of these blocking events is also associated with a northeastward shift of the northern surface air pressure center of the model’s representation of the North Atlantic Oscillation, and this connection is discussed. Finally, we discuss connections of ocean variability to sea ice variability in the Arctic Basin and to the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation.",

            "abstract": "The new model of Yuan and Beghein (2013), hereafter YBaniSV13, is the first global model to constrain 3-D azimuthal anisotropy in the deep upper mantle. It is compatible with previous models in the uppermost 200km of the mantle, but also displays 1% anisotropy above, inside, and below the Mantle Transition Zone (MTZ). Another interesting characteristic of this model is the change in fast seismic direction detected, on average, at ~250km depth and at the MTZ boundaries. These results have important consequences for our understanding of mantle deformation and convection patterns in the mantle. It is therefore important to assess the robustness if these features. We already tested that the model does not strongly depend on the reference 1-D mantle model, on the presence of discontinuities in this reference model, or on the crustal model and Moho depth used to calculate the laterally varying partial derivatives.\nIn this work, we apply a model space approach, the Neighborhood Algorithm (NA) of Sambridge (1999), to determine quantitative model uncertainties and parameter trade-offs. First, the NA generates an ensemble of models with a sampling density that increases toward the best fitting regions of the model space, and then performs a Bayesian appraisal of the models obtained that allows us to determine the likelihood of azimuthal anisotropy in different region of Earth’s interior. Such approaches have the advantage of sampling the model null-space, and therefore provide more reliable model uncertainties than traditional inverse techniques. We use YBaniSV13 as initial model, and search the model space around it, allowing for large enough deviations to test the robustness of the anisotropy amplitude. We compare results from a model space search based on the chi-square misfit and from a model space search based on the variance reduction, which is another useful measure of data fit that is independent of data uncertainties. Preliminary results for the chi-square driven search show that most likely model that is close to YBaniSV13, but uncertainties are rather large even in the shallow mantle where azimuthal anisotropy is usually considered to be well-resolved.",

            "abstract": "High throughput methods for sample purification are required to effectively exploit new opportunities in the study of non-traditional stable isotopes. Many geochemical isotopic studies would benefit from larger data sets, but these are often impractical with manual drip chromatography techniques, which can be time-consuming and demand the attention of skilled laboratory staff.\nHere we present a new, fully-automated single-column method suitable for the purification of both Ca and Sr for stable and radiogenic isotopic analysis. The method can accommodate a wide variety of sample types, including carbonates, bones, and teeth; silicate rocks and sediments; fresh and marine waters; and biological samples such as blood and urine. Protocols for these isotopic analyses are being developed for use on the new prepFAST-MCTM system from Elemental Scientific (ESI). The system is highly adaptable and processes up to 24-60 samples per day by reusing a single chromatographic column. Efficient column cleaning between samples and an all Teflon flow path ensures that sample carryover is maintained at the level of background laboratory blanks typical for manual drip chromatography.\nThis method is part of a family of new fully-automated chromatographic methods being developed to address many different isotopic systems including B, Ca, Fe, Cu, Zn, Sr, Cd, Pb, and U. These methods are designed to be rugged and transferrable, and to allow the preparation of large, diverse sample sets via a highly repeatable process with minimal effort.",

            "abstract": "For slow to intermediate spreading rate mid-ocean ridge (MOR) segments, magma supply decreases from center to tip if magma propagates from a central magma chamber to segment ends. Along-axis variation of magma supply implies changes in the amount of lithospheric extension accommodated by diking, which in turn are responsible for a variety of faulting styles, thermal structures and topography. Recent 2D numerical studies expressed the ratio between rate of dike injection and tectonic extension as a factor M and have successfully explained many characteristics of MOR tectonics. While they proved useful for understanding tectonics across axis, 3D models are still necessary for studying tectonic consequences of along-axis variations in diking. Here, we carry out 3D numerical experiments for such variations in diking by introducing the M factor formulation into SNAC, an updated Lagrangian explicit finite element code for modeling elasto-visco-plastic solid in 3D. We validate the M factor formulation implemented in SNAC through benchmarks against previous 2D models and will show 3D models under various scenarios for along-axis variation in M. We will also compare the 3D models with field observations and discuss implication for a formation mechanism of oceanic core complexes.",

Conventional methods of pixel-based classification classify each pixel independently by only considering its spectral properties. These pixel-based techniques are most applicable to medium and coarse-scale remote sensing, but often become less accurate at high spatial resolutions (pixels <= 1m) as the scene objects become larger than a pixel. Contextual classification techniques use not only the spectral properties of the pixel, but also the local spatial information to improve pixel labeling and classification. In this study, we use a focal pixel as predictor variables to use with a machine learning classifier. We applied this technique to a set of remotely sensed, multispectral hyperspatial imagery (Worldview-2) to map the type, distribution, and structure of vegetation in a Sierra Nevada forest.",

            "abstract": "The prediction of bed load transport is relevant to many aspects of river management such as river engineering, channel stability, and stream ecology. However, given that the functions used to predict bed load transport are very sensitive to input values, the uncertainty associated with estimates of transport at a specific place or point in time can be quite large. In addition, if the goal is to predict annual loads, a distribution characterizing the frequency of sediment-transporting flows must also be known. In this work we develop a model to predict annual bed load transport in ungauged catchments by computing the sediment movement associated with discharge levels between ½ of bankfull and bankfull flow. The model incorporates both the prediction of daily flows based on a power function, and a field-based parameterization of the spatial-temporal distribution of boundary shear stress based on two-dimensional flow modelling. The data inputs for the model are channel geometry (depth, width, and slope), grain size distribution, and drainage area. We will present the results sites in Colorado and Idaho. The model can be used to explore how changes in the frequency of extreme events impacts the total annual bed load and the spatial-temporal disturbance regime of aquatic ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "The seismic velocity structure of the lower mantle is dominated by two large, nearly antipodal low shear velocity structures, known as the African and Pacific LLSVPs (Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces). Recent work on the interpretation of tomographic images of the lowermost mantle has identified a smaller region of low shear velocities beneath Eurasia, dubbed the Perm Anomaly. The nature, origin, and dynamics of these low shear velocity anomalies remain obscure; an important outstanding question is how these structures interact with mantle flow. Observations of seismic anisotropy in the lowermost mantle can help to shed light on mantle dynamics in the vicinity of low shear velocity anomalies, and recent work by several groups has produced evidence for strong anisotropy in D\" along the boundaries of the African LLSVP. Here we interrogate the anisotropic structure of the lowermost mantle in the vicinity of the Perm Anomaly using SKS-SKKS splitting discrepancies measured at 18 long-running broadband stations in Europe. We selected stations for which the upper mantle anisotropy signal beneath the receiver has been well characterized and is simple enough to remove, isolating any contribution to splitting from the lowermost mantle. SK(K)S phases from earthquakes in the southwest Pacific subduction zones sample the lowermost mantle surrounding the Perm Anomaly, while phases from earthquakes in South America and Scotia sample the northernmost portion of the African LLSVP, allowing for a straightforward comparison between the two structures. Preliminary results indicate lowermost mantle anisotropy in both regions, with clear evidence for well-constrained discrepancies in SKS-SKKS splitting for the same event-station pairs measured at several different stations. Comparisons between observations of lowermost mantle anisotropy and the geometry of low shear velocity anomalies deduced from tomographic models shed light on the spatial relationship between the anomalies' edges and strong anisotropy, and on the dynamics of the mantle in and around these anomalous regions.",

Symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi play a role in weathering by targeting required plant nutrients, such as phosphorus (P) and calcium (Ca), that are contained in minerals. Field experiments coupled with geochemical analyses provided insights on two important symbioses: arbuscular-mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal fungi. In-growth bags containing different rock types (granites of varying P content as well as carbonate bedrock) were fabricated to create an in-situ geologic gradient for deployment in the two different symbioses. We targeted the temperate mixed hardwood forest site of Hubbard Brook as well as the subarctic birch forests of Abisko, Sweden. Both sites contained vegetation with known ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal symbioses. Weathering productivity under varying fungal type and mineral substrate, determined via elemental and isotopic proxies, was assessed in terms of mineral decomposition reactions (particularly apatite and biotite breakdown). Forthcoming metagenomic analyses will help to further illuminate impacts of bedrock composition on the fungal community and could provide greater insight into the influence of these factors on weathering processes.",

            "abstract": "The particles from aeolian or fluvial origin are a useful proxy for the reconstruction of atmospheric condition patterns in the past. Changes in continental aridity and the atmospheric condition determine the composition and amount of lithogenic material and the way of transport from the continent. Here we present a record of laminated sediments (core B040506) retrieved in the continental shelf off Peru. Wind long-term suspension (regional) and local aeolian transport during the last millennium (transition from Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) to Little Ice Age (LIA) and the current warm period (CWP)) at centennial to decadal resolution are characterized. The particle provenance and grain size components are discussed using a mathematical model of fractionation. This model assumes that lithological composition of the sediment is an assemblage of several log-normally distributed particle populations. In this way, an interactive least square fitting routine is used to fit the particle grain size collected with the mathematical expression. This allows inferring the spatial and temporal variation of particle populations and thus the transport mechanisms involved. Our results showed a decrease in aeolian transport from the MCA - LIA transition and during the LIA with except of the local aeolian transport that shows peaks during the LIA. This decrease during LIA is accompanied by an enhanced fluvial transport. During the CWP the aeolian transport (Paracas dust storm and wind long-term suspension) display a high variability and tendency to increase in detriment of runoff. Comparison with other South American records indicates that those changes are linked to change in the shift of the ITCZ and Pacific high at the centennial time resolution. Finally the great increase of the fluvial transport within the transition of the LIA to the CWP is synchronous to severe drought period recorded in the Indo-Pacific region indicating higher frequency of El Niño events. Hence these factors indicate an unambiguous change in the atmospheric regime in relationship with climate changes in the last millennium over the Peruvian continental shelf.",

            "abstract": "A standard approach to predict hydrologic fluxes in a changing climate is to downscale climate model output and feed it into a process-based hydrologic model. However, it has been demonstrated that 1) uncertainty in climate model projections often overwhelms uncertainties in the structure and parameterization of hydrologic models and 2) multiple parameter sets and structures can be used to make a hydrologic model match historical discharge (implying actual processes are not always known). Thus, it makes sense to attempt to use the simplest hydrologic model possible, both to focus on better quantifying uncertainty in climate model input and to try to ensure that the described hydrologic processes can actually be confirmed with some confidence. In addition, the use of a simple model increases the transparency of the science and can be helpful in building public consensus in making decisions regarding climate adaptation.\nAs a case study, the Genesee River watershed was examined. The Genesee River is a 6475 sq km watershed extending from Northern Pennsylvania to Lake Ontario, running south to north. We focused on an important but simple measure of hydrologic function: the annual runoff ratio (annual average streamflow/annual average precipitation). The annual runoff ratio varies between 0.3 and 0.8 from 1927 to 2013. The obvious explanation for higher runoff ratio years – high precipitation in seasons with little evapotranspiration – does not readily explain the variations. Three simple attempts to explain this variation were explored: a statistical regression model, the Budyko Curve, and a hydrologic “bucket” model. All models were compared based on ability to replicate annual variations in runoff ratios. Preliminary analyses suggest that although the “bucket” model most closely predicts the annual runoff ratio values, none of the simple models sufficiently explain the annual runoff ratio variability. This indicates that a more complicated hydrologic model may be necessary, with work still remaining to determine an appropriate model for common use.",

To illustrate this method we use data acquired during aircraft flight tests of a set of simple stereo imagers that are well suited to this purpose. Each of these imagers has three linear arrays on the focal plane, one looking forward, one looking aft, and one looking down. Push-broom images from each of these arrays are constructed, and then a spatial correlation analysis is used to deduce the delays and displacements required for wind and cloud height determination.\nWe will present the algorithms necessary for the retrievals, as well as the methods used to determine the uncertainties of the derived cloud heights and winds. We will apply the retrievals and uncertainty determination to a number of image sets acquired by the airborne sensors. We then generalize these results to potential space based observations made by similar types of sensors.",

            "abstract": "Dense Nonaqueous-Phase Liquids (DNAPLs) are a group of organic compounds that have been a serious problem for groundwater pollution in karst. The industrial production and utilization of these chemicals spread since 1940, and are present at tens of thousands of contaminated sites worldwide. The physic-chemical properties of DNAPLs in conjunction with the hydraulic properties of the karst systems create the perfect condition for DNAPLs to penetrate the epikarst, reach the groundwater, and more within the karst system to zones of potential exposure, such as wells, streams and wetlands. Trichloroethylene (TCE) is the most common DNPAL found in the subsurface environment. This research studies the fate and transport of TCE DNAPL in a karstified limestone physical model (KLPM).\nExperiments are carried out in KLPM. The KLPM is an enclosed stainless steel tank packed with a rectangular limestone block (15cm x 15cm x 76cm) that simulates a saturated confine karst aquifer. DNAPL experiment involve the injection of 40 ml of pure TCE into steady groundwater flow at the upstream boundary of the KLPM model, while sampling spatially and temporally along the block. Samples are analyzed for TCE on the pure and dissolved phase. Pure TCE is analyzed volumetrically and dissolved phase concentrations are analyze using a High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). TCE data is used to construct temporal distributions curves (TDCs) at different spatial locations. Results show that pure TCE volumes are collected at the beginnings of the experiment in sampling ports located near the injection port and along preferential flow paths. TCE concentration TDCs show spatial variations related to the limestone block heterogeneously. Rapid response to TCE concentrations is associated with preferential flow paths. Slow response and long tailing of TCE of TCE concentration are associated with diffusive transport in rock matrix and mass transport rates limitations. Bimodal distributions are associated with multiple flow path connectivity. Overall, results show that karstified limestone has a high capacity to rapidly transport, as well as store and slowly release TCE pure and dissolved phase. Response times to TCE concentrations depend on the mode of transport, and region of flow paths.",

This region is expected to experience significant climatic change, and associated impacts, in the coming decades. To better understand the spatiotemporal variability of vegetation in the Southwest and the expected climatic controls on timing and spatial extend of vegetation growth, we compared GIMMS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI, 1981-2011) against temperature and precipitation data. Spatial variations in vegetation seasonality and the timing of peak NDVI are linked to spatial variability in the precipitation regimes across the Southwest. Regions with spring NDVI peaks are dominated by winter precipitation, while late summer and fall peaks are in regions with significant summer precipitation driven by the North American Monsoon. Inter-annual variability in peak NDVI is positively correlated with precipitation and negatively correlated with temperature, with the largest correlation coefficients at one-month lags. The only significant long-term trends in NDVI are for northern Mexico, where agricultural productivity has been increasing over the last 30 years.",

Here we take three different statistically downscaled methods applied to CMIP5 global climate models and analyze their extreme precipitation events, hindcasted and projected, for the location of NASA Ames Research Center, in South San Francisco Bay. The downscaling methods analyzed are: i) Bias Correction Spatial Disaggregation (BCSD), ii) Bias Correction Constructed Analogs (BCCA), and iii) Extreme-value model based on synoptic climate predictors. We fit a generalized extreme value distribution (GEV) to datasets i and ii and use statistical tests to determine the significance of differences in the fitted GEV parameters. We explore the implications of the GEV parameter differences by comparing the daily precipitation values corresponding to 100-year, 500-year and 1,000-year return periods in the three datasets. The implications of how extreme daily values are assumed to change with spatial scale, from the gage location (a point location), to a small grid cell (1 km) or a larger grid cell (12 km), are explored.\nFrom our preliminary results, BCCA and BCSD projections predict that extreme precipitation events will be on the rise, and may have the potential to cause flooding at NASA Ames, and in the surrounding Bay Area. These downscaling methods can be studied in further detail in different regions of the contiguous US, and be used by local water resource management agencies in planning infrastructural adaptations.",

            "abstract": "We have created a global map of Io’s volcanic heat flow from 245 thermal sources indicative of ongoing or recent volcanic activity, and 8 additional outbursts [1,2]. We incorporate data from both spacecraft and ground-based instruments that have observed Io primarily at infrared wavelengths. This map provides a snapshot of Io’s volcanic activity and distribution during the Galileo epoch. Io’s volcanic activity, in terms of thermal emission from individual eruptive centres, spans nearly six orders of magnitude, from Surt in 2001 (78 TW) [3] to a faint hot spot in patera P197 (0.2 GW) [1]. We account for ≈54% of Io’s yearly volcanic heat flow, which emanates from ≈2% of Io’s surface [1]. Averaged heat flow from the non-active surface is 1 ± 0.2 W m2. This quantification of volcanic heat flow map provides constraints for modelling the magnitude and location of the internal heating of Io by tidal dissipation. The observed heat flow distribution is the result of interior heating and volcanic advection, the delivery of magma to the surface regardless of its depth of origin. As noted previously [1, 2] the distribution of heat flow is not uniform, which is not unexpected. The volcanic heat flow does not match the expected distributions from end-member models for both the deep-seated (mantle) heating model (which predicts enhanced polar heating) and the shallow (aesthenospheric) heating model, which predicts enhanced thermal emission at sub-jovian and anti-jovian longitudes. Intriguingly, heat flow curves using a bin size of 30 degrees show a longitudinal offset from the shallow heating model prediction of some tens of degrees [2], suggesting a more complex mixture of deep and shallow heating. Future work includes refinement of thermal emission by including temporal variability of thermal emission at individual volcanoes, and comparing the heat flow map with the Io Geological Map [4] and global topography [5].

The Arctic basin is divided into 14 different regions and we study how the Arctic wide observations emerge from these regional trends. In order to capture all possible time scales, the temporal dynamics within each spatial region, and in the basin as a whole, are treated as a multifractal. Our approach is Multi-Fractal Temporally Weighted Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-TWDFA), which captures long time scales that are not accessible by standard DFA or MF-DFA and are by definition not part of a procedure that assumes the dynamics are described by an order one auto-regressive process. We examine how the eastern, western, central and the marginal seas control the longest time scales and what processes are responsible for the responses found in the data. Of particular interest is how regions with substantial seasonality contribute to the basin-wide dynamics of the system. The importance of this is intertwined with the general problem of how and when the Arctic may pass on to a state in which the ice cover is seasonal. The transition from a perennial state to a seasonal ice cover is the persistent state of affairs in the marginal regions of the ice cover, which constitute 10 of the 14 subregions, whereas the remaining 4 are in various stages of partial ice cover at various times of the year. In this manner, we use sub-basins as laboratories for the entire basin.",

Effect of 3D local inhomogenities on MT data can be described by a real 2x2 distortion matrix. In this project we develop a method of simultaneous inversion of the full MT impedance data for 3D conductivity distribution and for the distortion matrix. Tikhonov regularization is employed to solve the resulting inverse problem. Integral equations method is used to compute MT responses. Minimization of the cost functional is achieved via conjugate gradient method. The inversion algorithm is tested on the synthetic data from Dublin Secret Model II (DSM 2) for which multiple inversion solutions are available for comparison. Inclusion of the distortion matrix provides faster convergence and allows coarser discretization of the near-surface while achievingsimilar or better data fits as inversion for the conductivity only with finely discretized shallow regions. As a field data example we chose a subset of the EarthScope MT dataset covering Great Basin and adjacent areas of the Western United States. Great Basin data inversion identified several prominent conductive zones which correlate well with areas of tectonic and geothermal activity.",

Model inputs and outputs such as precipitation and surface runoff are spatially aggregated over approximately 6,600 forecast basins with an average area of 1,200 square kilometers. In contrast, the NHDPlus dataset, which represents the geospatial fabric of the country, defines over 3 million catchments with an average area of 3 square kilometers. Downscaling the NWS land surface model outputs to the NHDPlus catchment scale in real-time requires the development of cyberinfrastructure to manage, share, compute and visualize large quantities of hydrologic data; streamflow computations through time for over 3 million river reaches. Between September 2014 and May 2015, the National Flood Interoperability Experiment (NFIE), coordinated through the Integrated Water Resource Science and Services (IWRSS) partners, will focus on building a national flood model for the country. This experiment will work to seamlessly integrate data and model services available on local and cloud servers (e.g. Azure) through disparate data sources operating at various spatial and temporal scales. As such, this paper will present a scalable information model that leverages the Routing Application for Parallel Computation of Discharge (RAPID) model to produce real-time flow estimates for approximately 67,000 NHDPlus river reaches in the NWS West Gulf River Forecast Center region.",

            "abstract": "Dust emission schemes in climate models are relatively simple and are tuned to represent observed background aerosol concentrations. Representations of dust emission in the models were developed from idealized experiments such as those conducted in wind tunnels. Improvement of current model dust emission schemes is hampered by a paucity of observations from key dust sources. The Dust Observations for Models project (DO4Models) was aiming on gathering data from source regions at a scale appropriate to climate model grid box resolution.\nHere we present (1) the results of 1D box model simulations using three commonly used parameterizations for the horizontal and vertical dust emission ﬂux, (2) using a newly proposed stochastic dust emission scheme for turbulent wind conditions, and (3) HadGEM3 regional climate model simulations using the current model setup for dust emissions. We are comparing box and RCM model results with DO4Models ﬁeld campaign data retrieved over a typical dust source in Botswana during two consecutive dry seasons (2011 and 2012).\nThe box model performance is further tested using observed soil moisture content, aerodynamic surface stress, shear velocity, and soil size properties. The results suggest that current dust emission schemes do not capture the observed emission ﬂux well. The saltation ﬂux is hugely overestimated, whereas the vertical ﬂux is moderately overestimated. The choice of the sand transport, soil moisture and roughness correction scheme is important but insufﬁcient to bring modeled ﬂuxes into agreement with observed dust ﬂuxes. The stochastic scheme does not suffer from this flux disparity, but cannot be used in cases of strong surface saltation. Potential reasons for the diagnosed mismatch are discussed and the impact of spatial averaging over the 11 ﬁeld sites within the 12x12km grid is evaluated.\nHadGEM3 is tested with regard to its capability to reproduce the observed meteorological conditions. Very good agreement with regard to the magnitude of the diurnal cycle in 10m wind speed, wind gusts and surface shear stress is found. overall, the performance of the model regarding the dynamics is sufﬁcient to focus on the shortcomings of the deployed dust emission scheme which is found to be the largest source of uncertainty in terms of dust emission ﬂux.",

            "abstract": "One of the challenges involved in learning earth science is the visualization of processes which occur over large spatial and temporal scales. Shaping Watersheds is an interactive 3D exhibit developed with support from the National Science Foundation by a team of scientists, science educators, exhibit designers, and evaluation professionals, in an effort to improve public understanding and stewardship of freshwater ecosystems. The hands-on augmented reality sandbox allows users to create topographic models by shaping real “kinetic” sand. The exhibit is augmented in real time by the projection of a color elevation map and contour lines which exactly match the sand topography, using a closed loop of a Microsoft Kinect 3D camera, simulation and visualization software, and a data projector. When an object (such as a hand) is sensed at a particular height above the sand surface, virtual rain appears as a blue visualization on the surface and a flow simulation (based on a depth-integrated version of the Navier-Stokes equations) moves the water across the landscape. The blueprints and software to build the sandbox are freely available online (\nhttp://3dh2o.org/71/\n) under the GNU General Public License, together with a facilitator’s guide and a public forum (with how-to documents and FAQs). Using these resources, many institutions (20 and counting) have built their own exhibits to teach a wide variety of topics (ranging from watershed stewardship, hydrology, geology, topographic map reading, and planetary science) in a variety of venues (such as traveling science exhibits, K-12 schools, university earth science departments, and museums). Additional exhibit extensions and learning modules are planned such as tsunami modeling and prediction. Moreover, a study is underway at the Lawrence Hall of Science to assess how various aspects of the sandbox (such as visualization color scheme and level of interactivity) affect understanding of earth science concepts.",

            "abstract": "MgO crystals grown under most reducing conditions from the melt in a carbon arc fusion furnace contain peroxy defects, normally a hallmark of highly oxidizing conditions [Freund and Wengeler (1982), J. Phys. Chem. Solids, 43, 129-145]. The peroxy defects are introduced into the MgO matrix by a redox conversion (RC) of OH– pairs, OH– x HO– <=> O22– + H2, where x stands for an Mg2+ vacancy. The RC occurs in a temperature window, below 500°C, where all major diffusional processes are frozen and the system has left the realm of thermodynamic equilibrium. This RC is not limited to MgO, however, but can be shown to take place in igneous rocks, the minerals of which also acquire peroxy concentrations during cooling. In the case of silicates the peroxy defects are of the form O3Si-OO-SiO3 [Freund (1987), Phys. Chem. Minerals, 15, 1-18].\nWe used a Y-doped ZrO2 amperometric O2 sensor (Rapidox 3000 Cambridge SensoTec) to record the O2 evolution from crushed MgO and granite from Barre VT, USA, during heating at 10ºC/min (see Fig.1). The granite powder was heated in a stream of 20 ml/min pure N2, united after the heating zone with a parallel stream of N2 + 100 ppm O2, needed to keep the 700ºC hot ZrO2 sensor operational. Between 250-550ºC the O2 partial pressure decreases, due to the fact that, in this temperature interval, granite releases reduced gases, in particular H2, which “burn” part of the premixed 100 ppm O2 inside the ZrO2 sensor. Upon further heating O2 evolves from the granite powder, consistent with the disproportionation of peroxy defects: O3Si-OO-SiO3 => O3Si-O-SiO3 + ½ O2.\nEvidence for peroxy defects in rocks exposed at the Earth surface has far-reaching consequences for the Earth’s evolution. During weathering, peroxy defects hydrolyze, O3Si-OO-SiO3 + 2 H2O => O3Si-OH HO-SiO3 + H2O2, with H2O2 decomposing to H2O + ½ O2. Hence, weathering is a process by which oxygen is delivered to the Earth’s surface environment. On the young Earth, where most surface rocks were certainly mafic or ultramafic, O2 produced through weathering was consumed to oxidize Fe2+ to Fe3+, leading to precipitation of the Banded Iron Formations over the first 1-2 GYrs of Earth’s history, and to oxidize other reduced sinks. As the continents became more granitic, some of the O2 produced through weathering became available as free O2 to enter the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Carbon uptake from the atmosphere during basalt weathering is an important control on global carbon cycling on geologic time scales. Indeed, the use of crushed olivine or basalt has been proposed as a geoengineering solution to provide a mechanism to offset human emissions. We present carbon sequestration, gas and solution phase, data collected in a landscape-scale (11 x 30 m hillslope, 1 m depth) experiment with crushed basalt under ambient conditions. The Landscape Evolution Observatory (LEO) provides a landscape scale – but highly controlled – experimental system that enables quantification of carbon dioxide consumption during initial weathering of a granular basaltic substrate. We found that simulated rainfall induces an immediate depletion of the CO2 concentration within the soil pore network and that the overall inorganic carbon content within the matrix is well predicted by initial inorganic carbon content, that added from the atmosphere and that exported by seepage flow. Rates of CO2 uptake are comparable to global estimates for basalt, but lower than those currently predicted by advocates for using olivine to sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "How will the distributions of precipitation and vertical velocity change in response to global warming? Global-average rainfall increases more slowly than extreme rain rates with warming, implying a change in the shape of the rainfall distribution. At the same time, the tropical vertical velocity distribution weakens, particularly its asymmetric component (the Walker circulation). Recent work by the author shows that the distribution of daily rainfall shifts to heavier rain rates in response to global warming and ENSO phases in climate models. Observations confirm the shift in response to ENSO phases. \nUsing an heuristic model relating the distributions of rainfall and vertical velocity, we show that an increase in skewness of the vertical velocity distribution replicates the shift of the precipitation distribution to heavier rain rates with warming. The skewness is the third moment of a statistical distribution, which measures its asymmetry. Implications of the increase in skewness of vertical velocity include and increase in dry days and a corresponding decrease in rain falling at moderate rain rates. When increased moistening that occurs with warming is also accounted for, the projected increase of extreme rainfall faster than the increase in the mean emerges. In contrast, broadening the vertical velocity distribution fails to replicate salient characteristics of the projected change in the rainfall distribution like the increase in dry day frequency. Climate models also show an increase in the skewness of daily-average vertical velocity in global warming simulations in most models.",

            "abstract": "Thermodynamic calculations of the fo2 on modeled bulk silicate Earth mantle composition predict the formation of Fe-Ni metal alloy at about 250-300 km in depth. At such conditions the speciation of subducted carbon will be mainly affected by the local Fe(Ni)/C ratio, with diamond, Fe3C and C-bearing Fe-Ni alloys being the most likely stable phases. To date however, no data are available to determine the effect of pressure and temperature on 1) the transport of carbon by diffusion in iron metal and 2) the kinetics of formation of carbide phases.\nWe performed multianvil experiments between 3 and 10 GPa and temperatures of 700-1200 ºC with the aim of measuring C diffusion in γ-Fe. Glassy carbon and synthetic diamond were used as diffusants, placed directly in contact with pure iron rod rods with a thickness of 800-1400 μm. FE-SEM was used for accurate analyses of the Fe-C interface and concentration profiles of carbon in iron were measured by electron microprobe.\nResults show that the diffusion coefficient for carbon in iron metal (~3x10-11 m2s-1) and the activation energy (~62 kJ/mol) are similar to previous data from 1 atm and suggest a small pressure effect. The activation volume (~1.5x10-6 m3/mol) determined from isothermal runs is in agreement with that determined for other elements for which an interstitial diffusion mechanism in iron has been established. At the interface between carbon and Fe the growth of a reaction rim was often observed. Time series experiments were therefore performed, to investigate the growth kinetics of iron carbide (Fe3C). Results will be used to 1) determine a model for the storage of C in metallic phases in the Earth's interior and 2) provide an experimental constraint on the formation of carbide phases during subduction, with implications for the deep carbon cycle and isotopic fractionation.",

Some of these sprites occurred in rapid succession - a few sprites within a 1-second interval. We have analyzed their ELF electromagnetic signatures recorded at the Hylaty ELF station, which we operate in a sparsely populated area of Poland. The station is equipped with two orthogonal magnetic antennas, one facing north-south and the other east-west. The thunderstorm was located only a few hundred kilometers away from the ELF station, which allowed us to obtain high quality waveforms. The video images were registered even closer, in Nydek, Czech Republic. \nBased on the recorded signal we have reconstructed the current moment waveforms and calculated the charge moment changes of the most interesting cases of sprites in rapid succession. We have divided them into two categories depending on the evolution of their current moment waveform, that is, sprites in sequences and dancing sprites. In this work we present examples that illustrate the difference between these two categories. We also show evidence of an ultra low frequency waveform associated with each sprite event that, surprisingly, was observed in the antenna that was practically parallel to the direction of the sprite associated discharges and could not have recorded the electromagnetic waves generated directly by the discharge current.",

            "abstract": "The Indianapolis Flux Experiment (INFLUX) aims to use a top-down inversion methodology to quantify sources of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions over an urban domain with high spatial and temporal resolution. This project is an experimental test bed which is intended to establish reliable methods for quantifying and validating GHG emissions independently of the inventory methods typically used for Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) of pollution sources. Analyzing the contribution of different source types or sectors is a fundamental step in order to achieve an accuracy level desired for such MRV applications. This is especially challenging when attempting to determine anthropogenic emissions during the growing season since biological GHG fluxes reach a maximum at this time.\nTo this end, the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF-ARW) version 3.5.1 was used along with a modified version of the Green House Gases chemistry module for simulating the CO2 mole fraction transport during September and October 2013. Sectoral anthropogenic CO2 emissions were obtained from Hestia 2012 and from Vulcan 2002 beyond the spatial coverage of Hestia. Biogenic CO2 emissions were simulated by using an augmented version of the “Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model” (VPRM) included in WRF-CHEM. An implementation of the unconstrained nonlinear global optimization method of Nelder and Mead was employed to find the optimum values for the VPRM parameters for each vegetation category by using data from Ameriflux eddy covariance flux towers.\nHere we present a preliminary assessment of the relative contribution of biological vs sectoral anthropogenic CO2 fluxes on the INFLUX measurements network. The simulations are compared to tower and aircraft measurements that include trace gases with the capacity to distinguish observationally anthropogenic and biogenic CO2 sources and sinks. In addition, an evaluation of the sensitivity of the sectoral attribution to meteorological errors is discussed.",

            "abstract": "Dunites produced by orthopyroxene (opx) dissolution in high porosity channels could provide pathways for opx-undersaturated melt to reach shallow levels [1]. Previous studies have considered these compacting-dissolution channels in the presence of a uniform upwelling mantle flow. In this study, the analysis of dunite channel formation and orthopyroxene dissolution was extended by introducing shearing on horizontal planes, as could be present in flowing mantle beneath spreading centers.\nA numerical experiment was formulated using the finite element library deal.II[3] applying a high order Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method to examine melt flow in a deforming, porous matrix. The conditions are similar to those in [2] with an additional prescribed horizontal shear rate component in the solid matrix. A Gaussian perturbation in the porosity at the base extends vertically through the domain, defining a melt channel. By varying the upwelling and shear rate, opx dissolution was examined to determine the behavior of dunite formation and interaction.\nModels of dissolution channels in upwelling mantle show that shearing deformation introduces several important effects for dunite formation. Shearing tilts the developing dunite, introducing an asymmetry in the opx gradient between the dunite channels and the surrounding harzburgite. The downwind gradient is sharp, nearly discontinuous; whereas the upwind gradient is gradual. Shearing limits the formation of dunite channels because increased shearing broadens the region of lower opx dissolution.\nThe dunite tilting causes buoyant, nearly vertically flowing melt to move across rather than along the dunite, preventing the dunite from providing an opx-free pathway. Our numerical experiments are continuing to determine conditions that may allow melt to move along a tilted dunite channel. Alternatively, minimal shearing in upwelling mantle may be required for dunite to act as a channel for vertical melt transport. This could imply that the deformed dunites observed in ophiolites may have undergone shearing subsequent to transporting melt at greater depth. [1]. Suhr et al. (2003) Geochem. Geophys.

The extent to which emerging water conservation alternatives impact flows or habitat quality (e.g. temperature, DO) for salmonids remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the proximal drivers of salmonid mortality over a range of connectivity conditions during summertime intermittency in Salmon Creek watershed, Sonoma County, CA. Through extensive sampling in paired subwatersheds over a period of two years, we tested the hypothesis that accumulation of readily bioavailable DOC in poorly flushed pools drives DO decline associated with loss of salmonids. We then traced the origin and flow pathways of DOC throughout the watershed using Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC). We obtained samples for DOC and stable isotope analyses at monthly intervals from 20 piezometers and surface water in the study reaches and from private wells and springs distributed throughout the watersheds. We also obtained in situ DO, conductivity and pH readings within stream study reaches. We determined DOC quality by SUVA (specific UV absorbance) and fluorescence index. We calculated stream metabolism rates using the single station method. In pools instrumented with DO sensors, we compared changing DOC quality during the summer months to changes in DO concentrations and stream metabolism. Our results show that the duration of complete disconnection of pools during the summer months and stream metabolic rates are positively correlated with salmonid mortality. Furthermore, our results indicate that salmonid mortality is greatest in disconnected pools with low DOC fluorescence indices and high SUVA values, indicative of terrestrially derived DOC and little or no groundwater inflow. Conversely low salmonid mortality was found in disconnected pools with high fluorescence index and low SUVA, indicative of microbially derived DOC. These pools showed clear signs of hyporheic inflow during summertime drying despite complete surficial disconnection. PARAFAC analysis pinpointed groundwater sources of hyporheic flow in the watershed, suggesting that targeted aquifer recharge may contribute to salmonid recovery by augmenting flow in summer refugia.",

Relationships between dune height, width and spacing, and the spatial variation in these parameters have been widely employed to provide quantitative information that can be used to describe dune patterns and make comparisons between dunes in widely separated areas, as well as to identify different generations of dunes. Digital elevation models (e.g. ASTER GDEM) provide a rich resource of data for analyses of dune patterns at landscape scales in several ways, including: (1) more extensive analyses using traditional measures, such as relationships between dune height and spacing, and the spatial variation in these parameters; and (2) estimation of sediment thickness on a regional scale. Analyses of data for Arabian and Namibian sand seas and dune fields show that dune height and spacing relationships are much more variable than previously reported and call into question existing models. Regional patterns of sediment thickness reveal areas of erosion, bypass, and accumulation that can be related to transport pathways and wind regimes. The widespread occurrence of complex dune patterns as well as the magnitude of the newly available data sets however requires more sophisticated analyses than simple extraction of dune morphometric parameters using GIS approaches. Geostatistical analyses using spatial autocorrelation, Fourier, and Wavelet methods have been employed in analyses of sub-aqueous bedforms and show promise for dune systems. Automated or semi-automated identification of dune length, width, spacing, and trends using advanced image analysis techniques such as linear segment detection is a potentially transformative approach. The strengths and weaknesses of these methods to provide pertinent geomorphic information are currently being evaluated, but they have the potential to provide new insights into the nature of dune patterns.",

            "abstract": "The evaluation of the global atomic oxygen loss rate and its changes over geologic time is necessary for a better understanding of the evolution of the Martian atmosphere. The recent surface geomorphological evidence suggests that water has played a key role in forming the present atmospheric environment. Throughout the planet’s history, the inventory of water has been affected in part by changing solar radiation and solar wind conditions. In this study, we investigate the evolution of the oxygen atom inventory by simulating the hot oxygen corona for solar conditions appropriate to about 2.5 Gyr ago (about 3 times the current solar EUV flux). Dissociative recombination of O2+ion is assumed to remain as the dominant source of hot atomic oxygen at ancient times.\nTo describe ancient Mars, we present the 3D self-consistent simulations of the Martian hot oxygen corona by one-way coupling our Adaptive Mesh Particle Simulator (AMPS) with the ancient thermosphere and ionosphere as simulated by the 3D Mars Global Ionosphere Thermosphere Model (M-GITM), a newly developed atmospheric model. The structure and composition of the Martian upper atmosphere and the hot oxygen corona during early solar conditions are compared with those at the current epoch to study the evolution of the macroscopic parameters and their effects on the hot oxygen corona. The coupled framework provides the density and escape probabilities of hot oxygen and estimates the global atmospheric loss rates for the conditions considered. These results are also being used as input into calculations of the global solar wind interaction with Mars’ atmosphere, ionosphere and exosphere.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that Mars contains more potentially life-supporting habitats (either in the present or past), than once thought. The key to finding life on Mars, whether extinct or extant, is to first understand which biomarkers and biosignatures are strictly biogenic in origin. Studying ancient habitats and fossil organisms of the early Earth can help to characterize potential Martian habitats and preserved life. This study, which focuses on the preservation of fossil microorganisms from the Archean Eon, aims to help define in part the science methods needed for a Mars sample return mission, of which, the Mars 2020 rover mission is the first step.\nHere is reported variations in the geochemical and morphological preservation of filamentous fossil microorganisms (microfossils) collected from the 2.5-billion-year-old Gamohaan Formation of the Kaapvaal Craton of South Africa. Samples of carbonaceous chert were collected from outcrop and drill core within ~1 km of each other. Specimens from each location were located within thin sections and their biologic morphologies were confirmed using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Raman spectroscopic analyses documented the carbonaceous nature of the specimens and also revealed variations in the level of geochemical preservation of the kerogen that comprises the fossils. The geochemical preservation of kerogen is principally thought to be a function of thermal alteration, but the regional geology indicates all of the specimens experienced the same thermal history. It is hypothesized that the fossils contained within the outcrop samples were altered by surface weathering, whereas the drill core samples, buried to a depth of ~250 m, were not. This differential weathering is unusual for cherts that have extremely low porosities. \nThrough morphological and geochemical characterization of the earliest known forms of fossilized life on the earth, a greater understanding of the origin of evolution of life on Earth is gained. This study allows a unique insight into the complex nature of microfossil preservation, even between samples taken from similar depositional environments. These investigations also may aid in our knowledge of where and how to search for possible life on Mars and how to plan the scientific requirements of the proposed Mars sample return missions.",

            "abstract": "As sea ice model grid resolution moves to shorter length scales, we enter a scale regime where the continuum assumption breaks down and is no longer mechanically equivalent to the physical system. We present a sea ice dynamics model based on the discrete element method (DEM), as an alternative numerical framework for high-resolution modeling of sea ice dynamics. The CRREL Sea Ice DEM model treats the ice pack and floes as a collection of ice “grains” to describe the sea ice as a system where the effects of element-to-element interaction significantly influence the mechanical behavior of the bulk material. Our modeling approach has been successfully applied to model sea ice processes such as pressure ridging (Hopkins 1998), aggregation due to wave-ice interaction (Hopkins & Shen 2001), and the mesoscale evolution of the floe size distribution (Hopkins & Thorndike 2006). These ice elements have sufficiently small length scales to capture meter scale heterogeneity of the ice pack, which may govern the bulk behavior at the scale of interest (10-1000 km scale). We will present simulations of ice motion for the Beaufort Sea for the summer 2014 that are initialized and validated from high-resolution synthetic aperture radar acquired from the RADARSAT-2 and TerraSAR-X (200 to 1 m pixel resolution, respectively) satellite platforms to evaluate the ability of a DEM sea ice model to provide accurate forecasts of the ice pack evolution.",

            "abstract": "Most faults have not ruptured once historically, let alone repeatedly. Estimating future rupture length of an earthquake source has been a challenge since the 1970s when concepts of full and half fault lengths were employed. In the 1980s paleoseismic event timing and observations of slip, coupled with geometric and other physical fault changes, led to concepts of fault segmentation and it’s modeling for hazard. The Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast 3 (UCERF 3, Field et al., 2014) relaxed segmentation, guided by rules in which a separation distance of ≤5km and orientation to Coulomb stress changes at fault junctions are prime factors for allowing fault-to-fault jumps. A set of ~350 fault sections produced ~250K ruptures ranging in length from 15 km-1200 km. An inversion provided the rates of these, which range from 102-108 years. Many of the long ruptures have exceedingly low individual rates within the UCERF 3 geologic model but are sufficient in number to release cumulative moment that brings the long-term (Myr) and historical (since 1850) MFDs for the California region into close agreement.\nDoes UCERF 3 have too many multi-fault ruptures? Since 1850 there have been ~260 surface ruptures worldwide in shallow continental crust. 77% are 0-49km; 6% exceed 150km, and the longest is 1906 San Francisco (435-470 km). In California since 1857 there have been 31 surface ruptures. 77% are shorter than 49 km. The longest are 1906, 1857 Fort Tejon (297km), and 1872 Owens Valley (108 km). Most long historical strike-slip ruptures are continuous and geomorphically well-defined traces with limited geometric changes. In contrast, UCERF3 modeling of the south Hayward, as an example, allows it to participate in ruptures that extend to the south ends of the San Andreas or San Jacinto faults (900 km). These include branching (Hayward-Calaveras, San Andreas-San Jacinto) and jumps (Calaveras-San Andreas) on creeping sections of these faults. 5km is the connectivity threshold in UCERF 3 but only 40% of historical ruptures have negotiated this distance. There are other controls of rupture propagation: frictional properties, rupture dynamics, creep, and, as shown by the 2002 Denali-Totschunda rupture, the timing of the prior event and level of stress accumulation on adjacent fault sections. Time will be the tester.",

            "abstract": "There are several stages in any hydrological modeling campaign, including: formulation and analysis of a priori information, data acquisition through field campaigns, inverse modeling, and prediction of some environmental performance metric (EPM). The EPM being predicted could be, for example, contaminant concentration or plume travel time. These predictions often have significant bearing on a decision that must be made. Examples include: how to allocate limited remediation resources between contaminated groundwater sites or where to place a waste repository site. Answering such questions depends on predictions of EPMs using forward models as well as levels of uncertainty related to these predictions.\nUncertainty in EPM predictions stems from uncertainty in model parameters, which can be reduced by measurements taken in field campaigns. The costly nature of field measurements motivates a rational basis for determining a measurement strategy that is optimal with respect to the uncertainty in the EPM prediction. The tool of hypothesis testing allows this uncertainty to be quantified by computing the significance of the test resulting from a proposed field campaign. The significance of the test gives a rational basis for determining the optimality of a proposed field campaign.\nThis hypothesis testing framework is demonstrated and discussed using various synthetic case studies. This study involves contaminated aquifers where a decision must be made based on prediction of when a contaminant will arrive at a specified location. The EPM, in this case contaminant travel time, is cast into the hypothesis testing framework. The null hypothesis states that the contaminant plume will arrive at the specified location before a critical amount of time passes, and the alternative hypothesis states that the plume will arrive after the critical time passes. The optimality of different field campaigns is assessed by computing the significance of the test resulting from each one. Evaluating the level of significance caused by a field campaign involves steps including likelihood-based inverse modeling and semi-analytical conditional particle tracking.",

The purpose of this study is to accomplish the following: 1) identify the factors controlling algal bloom the development and propagation using Aqua-MODIS satellite data products (from 07/2002 to 07/2012), (2) identify the spatial and temporal variations in Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) production in relation to the controlling factors; and 3) develop conceptual and predictive models (using in-situ and satellite-based datasets) that account for reported historical blooms and can successfully predict algal bloom proliferation in space and time. To achieve these goals, the following tasks were accomplished: 1) in-situ Chl-a data was correlated with satellite-based (MODIS and MERIS) Chl-a data products (OC3M, GIOP, GSM, and OC4E); 2) Chl-a concentration (from OC3M) were correlated spatially and temporally with potential controlling factors (SST, Turbidity, Euphotic Depth, Precipitation, Photosynthetically Available Radiation, Wind Vectors etc.); 3) the stepwise regression method was applied to identify the most significant controlling factors and to determine their order of importance; and 4) a back-propagation artificial neural network (ANN) was constructed to predict the bloom occurrences in time (first layer process) and space (second layer process). Findings include: 1) the Aqua-MODIS OC3M Chlorophyll-a algorithm correlated best with in-situ measurements (RMSE: 2.42, Mean Bias: 32.2%); (2) maximum OC3M Chl-a concentration was observed throughout the months of August through October (Temp. range: 18.4° to 22.3 °C); 3) the stepwise regression identified SST, secchi disk depth, wind direction, OC3M and wind speed as the most indicative temporal factors (SST: most significant R2: 80.1%) and the OC3M, distance to shore, GSM, SST and GIOP as the most indicative spatial variables; 4) the ANN model showed an excellent prediction performance (area under receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve: 0.99), and (5) findings are being utilized for the development of an early warning system in the Kuwait Bay.",

For example, recent work has identified carbon-concentrating mechanisms in coccolithophores—in which the organisms actively enhance the abundance of CO2 in the chloroplast by pumping in bicarbonate—as the source of vital isotope effects in coccolith calcite. Understanding the record for and consequences of this management in the geologic record remains challenging. Here we examine the geometry and geochemistry of coccoliths in surface sediments from the deep ocean to relate these measurements to the modern growth environment in the surface ocean. In this core-top dataset that spans a wide range of environmental and oceanographic settings, we measure the size and thickness of coccolith plates, the trace metal and stable isotopic carbon in coccolith calcite, as well as determine alkenone biomarker fluxes and alkenone carbon isotopic composition (εp). This holistic approach aims to elucidate the carbon acquisition and allocation strategies employed by modern coccolithophores and ultimately provide a better framework for interpreting paleoproductivity. This method may provide insight into the growth rate and carbon allocation of coccoliths in the past, and may improve our understanding of the influence of atmospheric CO2 on coccolithophore communities.",

Examples of such feedbacks include increased upper ocean warming though absorption of solar radiation, elevated internal wave energy and mixing that may entrain heat stored in subsurface watermasses (e.g. the relatively warm Pacific Summer (PSW) and Atlantic (AW) waters) and elevated surface wave energy that acts to deform and fracture sea ice, all of which grow in importance with increasing open water extent.\nInvestigations of MIZ dynamics must resolve the short spatial and temporal scales associated with the processes that govern the exchange of momentum, heat and freshwater near the atmosphere-ice-ocean interface while also achieving the spatial scope and temporal persistence required to characterize how the balance of processes shifts as a function of evolving open water fraction and open water fetch to the south. The recent Office of Naval Research (ONR) Marginal Ice Zone program provides an example of how autonomous platforms can be applied to provide high-resolution measurements that extend from open water, through the MIZ and deep into ice-covered regions while providing persistence to quantify evolution over an entire summertime melt season. This talk will provide an overview of the strategy developed by the ONR MIZ team and highlight early results from the 2014 field program.",

Potentially hazardous air pollution episodes result when meteorological conditions facilitate the accumulation and/or formation of airborne pollutants in the near-surface atmosphere and may persist if ventilation, vertical escape, and/or scavenging of the pollutants fails to occur. Here, we analyze particulate matter (PM) observations from a suite of globally-distributed locations, characterize the intensity and persistence of extreme duration above-EPA/WMO-standard PM2.5 pollution events, and examine the role of meteorological factors in their occurrence. We focus on the atmospheric phenomenon of air stagnation and its constituent meteorological components (dry day occurrence and light surface and upper air wind speed occurrence) and characterize the role of each on observed extreme duration episodes. Based on this observational analysis, we then use an ensemble of CMIP5 historical and high-emission scenario simulations to examine the occurrence of model-simulated stagnation and stagnation component persistence. We characterize extreme duration stagnation episodes within the multi-model ensemble and assess the response of stagnation persistence to enhanced mid-twenty first century radiative forcing.",

            "abstract": "Delineating the climate processes governing precipitation variability in drought-prone Texas is critical for predicting and mitigating climate change effects, and requires the reconstruction of past climate beyond the instrumental record. Presently, there are few high-resolution Holocene climate records for this region, which limits the assessment of precipitation variability during a relatively stable climatic interval that comprises the closest analogue to the modern climate state. To address this, we present speleothem growth rate and δ18O records from two central Texas caves that span the mid to late Holocene, and assess hypotheses about the climate processes that can account for similarity in the timing and periodicity of variability with other regional and global records. A key finding is the independent variation of speleothem growth rate and δ18O values, suggesting the decoupling of moisture amount and source. This decoupling likely occurs because i) the often direct relation between speleothem growth rate and moisture availability is complicated by changes in the overlying ecosystem that affect subsurface CO2 production, and ii) speleothem δ18O variations reflect changes in moisture source (i.e., proportion of Pacific- vs. Gulf of Mexico-derived moisture) that appear not to be linked to moisture amount. Furthermore, we document a 1,500-year periodicity in δ18O values that is consistent with variability in the percent of hematite-stained grains in North Atlantic sediments, North Pacific SSTs, and El Nino events preserved in an Ecuadorian lake. Previous modeling experiments and analysis of observational data delineate the coupled atmospheric-ocean processes that can account for the coincidence of such variability in climate archives across the northern hemisphere. Reduction of the thermohaline circulation results in North Atlantic cooling, which translates to cooler North Pacific SSTs. The resulting reduction of the meridional SST gradient in the Pacific weakens the air-sea coupling that modulates ENSO activity, resulting in faster growth of interannual anomalies and larger mature El Niño relative to La Niña events. The asymmetrically enhanced ENSO variability can account for a greater portion of Pacific-derived moisture reflected by speleothem δ18O values.",

            "abstract": "Dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) are an important class of groundwater contaminants. Their migration pathways are particularly difficult to locate in fractured rock aquifers, which are abundant in North America. Over one million people in Southern Ontario alone obtain their drinking water from the Silurian dolostone bedrock. Once a DNAPL is trapped in an aquifer, it becomes a long-term threat to the source water quality. It is imperative to be able to locate and quantify trapped DNAPL to implement appropriate remedial strategies.\nThis study quantifies volumetric DNAPL entrapment utilizing an invasion percolation (IP) approach to simulate the imbibition of water in a DNAPL-saturated fracture. The relationship between the volumetric fraction of trapped DNAPL, aperture field statistics and fracture orientation was investigated by varying a number of parameters; overall, 34,560 simulation were completed. The standard deviation (σb) and mean (μb) of the apertures were varied from 0.01-0.3 mm and 0.5-1.5 mm, respectively. The standard deviation (σz) and correlation length (λz) of the mid aperture field were varied from 0.01-10mm and 5-50mm, respectively. Fracture orientation was varied from 60o above (super-horizontal) to 60o below (sub-horizontal) horizontal.\nThe results demonstrate that: 1) fractures oriented sub-horizontally permit the complete drainage of DNAPL, though this does not occur for horizontal and super-horizontal fractures; 2) when the coefficient of variation (COV) is larger than 0.1 the fracture orientation has little effect on the volumetric ratio of DNAPL entrapped; and 3) increasing standard deviation of the mid aperture field increases the range of the volumetric ratio of trapped DNAPL.",

            "abstract": "Land-atmosphere coupling strength indicates the degree of feedbacks between soil moisture anomaly and precipitation, playing an important role in local and regional weather and climate. The U.S. Midwest and Great Plains are global hot spots with strong coupling strength reported by many climate models and some observations. However, few models used in these studies have included or analyzed effects from irrigation in these regions, where 10% of croplands are irrigated. Irrigation could substantially increase soil moisture and growing season crop leaf area index, thereby altering water and energy cycles and ultimately precipitation. In this study, we used a regional climate model that incorporated dynamic crop growth and precision irrigation (WRF3.3-CLM4crop) to investigate irrigation effects on land-atmosphere coupling strength. We quantify the coupling strength using two recently developed indices. Both indices showed a significant decline in coupling strength with irrigation in the Midwest and Northern Great Plains. Decreases were highly correlated with the degree of increase in soil moisture in irrigated cropland. For non-irrigated areas, the correlation between changes in soil moisture and coupling strength are nonlinear, with some areas increasing and some decreasing in coupling strength although they all have increased soil moisture on average. Our study suggests climate models that do not incorporate an irrigation scheme may overestimate the land-atmosphere coupling strength in irrigated regions.",

            "abstract": "Faulting in the Inner California Borderlands is complex. In the past, this region has undergone various deformational events such as extensional and rotational deformation to variable strike-slip deformation; this has imparted the geomorphology and fault structures observed offshore Southern California. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the current fault structures and the hazards they pose to populated coastal regions. The geometry and architecture of these structures can have significant implications for ground motions in the event of a rupture, and therefore impact working models of hazard assessment. Here, focusing on the Newport-Inglewood/Rose Canyon (NI/RC) and Palos Verdes (PV) fault zones, we use new and existing multibeam, CHIRP and Multi-Channel Seismic (MCS) data to describe the geometry of the fault system. We interpret reprocessed (prestack time migration) MCS data collected in 1979, 1986, and 2006 as well as newly acquired high-res MCS datasets collected offshore San Diego County. Combining these high and intermediate resolution datasets with very high resolution CHIRP data, we define structures that show distinct changes in the style of deformation through time, and place constraints on the segmentation of faults in this system.\nThe timing of the most recent deformation on the NI/RC appears to vary along-strike. Likewise, the NI/RC fault’s dip direction and angle appears to vary along-strike, and these changes in dip seem to mark the boundaries of restraining and releasing bends. Additionally, the NI/RC fault appears to die away to the north, possibly partitioning its strain on to the PV fault. We will present interpretations of the faults’ current deformational activity as well as likelihood of rupture propagating across releasing/restraining bends, and discuss how this impacts current fault models that are employed for hazard assessment for Los Angeles and San Diego counties.",

MC3E was a collaborative campaign led by the National Aeronautic and Space Administration’s (NASA’s) Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission and the U.S. Department of Energy ARM program.\nMC3E provided a unique opportunity to compare in-situ data from aircraft based microphysical probes with data from polarimetric radars in the radar bright band region or melting layer. One of the primary objectives of this study was to understand how riming and aggregation affect polarimetric signatures. In depth case study analysis of cloud and precipitation microphysics was performed for two specific cases, April 27th, 2011 (A27) and May 20th, 2011 (M20). Both these cases provided coincident aircraft and radar data in extensive stratiform cloud regions.\nMeasurements from the University of North Dakota (UND) Citation aircraft and polarimetric data from the ARM CSAPR data reveal interesting details of cloud scale processes. Observations based on data from cloud probes (2DC, CIP and HVPS) along with in-situ observations of environmental variables provide remarkable details of particle growth and cloud dynamics for both case studies. For the A27 case study, UND aircraft measurements from two successive spiral profiles through the stratiform cloud region showed a transition from a riming dominated region to an aggregation dominated region. This is supported by polarimetric data from the C-Band ARM Precipitation Radar (CSAPR ). An extensive region of trailing stratiform precipitation was sampled in the M20 case study, where the aggregation, melting, and evaporation processes were measured in detail with the in-situ microphysical instruments. Latest findings from MC3E based on this combined aircraft and polarimetric radar study will be presented at the conference.",

The present study focuses on the application of geostatistical methods to examine the land cover and population density dynamics in the river basin. The geostatistical methods include spatial autocorrelation, overlapping neighborhood statistics with Pearson’s correlation coefficient, Moran’s I index analysis, and indicator variogram analysis with rose diagram. The land cover and land use maps were constructed from USGS Landsat images and Globcover images from the European Space Agency. The target years of the analysis are 1970, 1986, 2000, 2005, and 2009. The calculation of net changes in land cover indicates significant variation in the changes of rainfed cropland, mosaic cropland, and grassland. Spatial autocorrelation analysis and Moran I index analysis showed that the distribution of land cover is highly clustered. A new GIS geostatistical tool was designed to calculate the overlapping neighborhood statistics with Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the land use/land cover and population density datasets. The 10x10 neighborhood cell unit showed a clear correlation between the variables in certain zones of the study area. The ranges calculated from the indicator variograms of land use and land cover and population density showed that the cropland and sparse vegetation are most closely related to the spatial change of population density.",

            "abstract": "The extraction of tightly bound natural gas and oil raises environmental concerns regarding shallow drinking water resources. These concerns include impacts of migration of contaminants through induced and natural fractures, drilling imperfections, wastewater discharge and accidental spills. Improved understanding of the fate and transport of contaminants through long-term monitoring, and sharing of data between industry, regulators and researchers will help to effectively manage risks for shallow water resources associated with the unconventional gas and oil industry. Based on the North-American experiences related to unconventional oil and gas resources and monitoring approaches developed in the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) context, we suggest conceptual models for monitoring the potential contamination of shallow aquifers overlying production zones. The strength of sensitive geochemical tracers is demonstrated based on conceptual approaches (e.g. diffusion model) and field and tracer studies (e.g. geochemical and isotopic monitoring) with three objectives: 1) characterize subsurface derived contaminants as direct geochemical and isotopic indicators; 2) assess geochemical processes enhanced by the fluid intrusion; 3) understand parameters and processes which could impact or alter the geochemical and isotopic signatures of the contaminants (e.g. microbial oxidation, migration or transport processes etc.) to determine indirect indicators of potential contaminant leakage. This comprehensive geochemical and isotope approach using direct and indirect indicators with the analyses of major and minor ions, trace elements, and δ11B, δ7Li, δ34SSO4, δ18OSO4, 87Sr/86Sr, δ18OH2O, and δ2HH2O values in the CO2FIELDLAB project (Humez et al., 2014) allowed discriminating reactive mechanisms from non-reactive mixing processes associated with gas leakage within a shallow aquifer. These and other results indicate that this conceptual approach is promising for monitoring strategies related to unconventional oil and gas resources.\nHumez et al., 2014. Chem. Geol., 368, 11-30.",

The specific fraction of heat that is throughput varies inversely with the normal optical thickness as\nf∼0.41−0.024τ.\n\nThe total emitted flux from the B ring varies linearly with\nsin\nB\n′\nas expected, and appears to be dominated by isotropic emission both on the lit and unlit sides. There is no indication of non-isotropic emission from the unlit side, while on the lit side there is an additional emission from a low-phase hot spot with a width of\n50\n∘\n, which accounts for approximately 2-10\\% of the total emission. Accounting for wake orientation affects only the inner B Ring, decreasing the absorbed incident radiation by 5-10\\% there. \nUsing a simple model for thermal transport, we derive high effective conductivity of the ring of\n0.5W\nm\n−1\nK\n−1\n, together with a heat flux through the midplane of the rings that is about\n1.5W\nm\n−2\nat high solar elevations. This conductivity is at the high end of plausible values derived using only radiative and conductive heat flux, but can easily be explained if particle diffusion carries heat across the midplane of the rings. We briefly examine the manner in which radiative conduction enhances the conductivity of a static medium, and present a study of the effective emissivity of the B ring that might help to resolve whether mechanical diffusion is necessary to explain the data.",

            "abstract": "To investigate mechanisms of explosive basaltic volcanism, we studied the ca. 1085 AD Sunset Crater eruption in the San Francisco Volcanic Field (SFVF) of northern Arizona. This eruption, the youngest in the SFVF, first featured fissure eruptions (explosive phases 1-2) and a small lava flow, and then activity narrowed to a central vent producing explosive phases 3-8 and two additional lava flows. While the first two phases were Strombolian-style explosions, middle phases (3-5) were subplinian in character and produced an anomalously large tephra deposit. The final phases (6-8) are poorly characterized at this stage. The total erupted volume of lava and tephra is >0.7 km3 DRE of alkali olivine basalt with a large proportion of crystal-free glass and low phenocryst content.\nWe studied 82 primary melt inclusions (MIs) in the largest tephra units (explosive phases 3, 4) to investigate magma volatiles and storage conditions. To prioritize primary volatile contents, we picked rapidly quenched free olivine crystals (Fo 81-85; 0.5-2 mm) and selected large volume MIs (50-180 µm) located near crystal cores for analysis. We observed vapor bubbles in all MIs and also noted rare occurrences of CO2-rich gas inclusions. MIs show little major element variability suggesting little crystal fractionation (K2O 0.8-1.1 wt.%). Post-entrapment crystallization is also minor (2-9%). The MI compositions from the two phases largely overlap, with phase 4 skewed to slightly higher K2O. FTIR spectroscopy shows that the MIs are relatively dry and CO2-rich. Water abundances vary 0.8-1.6 wt.% with a median of 1.25 wt.%, while most MIs have CO2 abundances 1,600-3,400 ppm. Phases 3 and 4 are essentially identical in water content. CO2 contents of phases 3 and 4 show considerable overlap, however the phase 4 MIs are skewed toward high CO2 (>2,500 ppm). These results require a minimum MI entrapment depth of ~11 km from fluid saturation constraints. Overall, the MIs indicate a largely homogeneous magma stored at mid-crustal depths. These two highly explosive phases (3 & 4) are quite similar, though the latter phase tapped a slightly deeper portion of the magma storage zone.",

For example, winter snow thickness, ice layers formed within and, more particularly, at the base of the snowpack, have all been linked to fluctuations in in High Arctic animal populations in Svalbard. At a field site in northwestern Svalbard, measurements of snow and snow properties (e.g. ice layers) have been made along a series of transects around the peninsula Brøggerhalvøya. These measurements are typically made over a 1-2 day period in April/May, and have been performed annually since 2002. The typical procedure is to sound at 100-200 m intervals along the transects, digging snow pits at regular intervals to determine the snowpack stratigraphy, in particular the basal ice layer thickness, if present. In a few years these measurements have been supplemented with 900 MHZ ground-penetrating radar (GPR) profiles. In January-February 2012 there was an extreme warm period across all of Svalbard, with temperatures well above freezing (up to 7°C) across the entire archipelago and record-breaking precipitation (nearly 10 cm of rain falling in one day at Ny-Ålesund). This extreme event led to a pervasive ground-ice layer 5-20 cm thick across most of the low-lying terrain around Brøggerhalvøya. I compare measurements made in this year to those made in other years, including a comparison of GPR profiles made in 2012 and in 2007, a year with very little ground-ice.",

The UAV dataset is complemented by measurements from a suite of ship-based instrumentation, including a foremast MABL eddy covariance system, scanning and point lidar altimeters, a laser Doppler wind profiler, and a digitized X-band radar system (WaMoS). The combination of the unmanned aircraft and the ship instrumentation provides a novel and valuable dataset of many air-sea interaction phenomena, extending from 100s of meters below the surface to 1500 m above. Ocean surface displacements observed with the UAV lidar altimeter (coupled with a GPS/IMU) give evidence of high-frequency equatorial internal waves, with measurements consistent and coherent with those from ship-based X-band radar, the Hydrographic Doppler Sonar System (HDSS), and a theoretical model. UAV-based flux measurements at low altitudes (down to 30 meters) are consistent with ship-based eddy covariance measurements, but reveal differences between along- and crosswind sampling flight legs associated with longitudinal roll structures that are not captured by the ship measurements from tracks mainly in the upwind-downwind directions.",

This pilot project was presented to the public at the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology’s (SOEST) Biennial Open House weekend. An estimated 7,600 people attended the two-day event, including children and teachers from Hawaii’s schools, home school students, community groups, families, and science enthusiasts. Our exhibit demonstrated real-time sonar mapping of a cardboard volcano using a toy size research vessel on a fixed 2D model ship track suspended above a model seafloor. Sound wave travel times were recorded using an unltrasonic emitter/receiver attached to an Arduino microcontroller platform, while the same system measured displacement along the ship track. This data was streamed through a USB connection to a PC running MatLab, where a 3D model was updated as the ship collected data. Our exhibit demonstrates the practical use of complicated concepts, like wave physics and data processing, in a way that even the youngest elementary students are able to understand. It provides an accessible avenue to learn about sonar mapping, and could easily be adapted to talk about bat and marine mammal echolocation by replacing the model ship and volcano. The exhibit received an overwhelmingly positive response from attendees, and has inspired the group to develop a more interactive model for future exhibitions, using multiple objects to be mapped that participants could arrange, and a more robust ship movement system that participants could operate.",

These different measurement types have different response times and very different spatial averaging properties, both horizontally and vertically. Accounting for these different measurement properties and explicit propagation of associated uncertainties is necessary to test particular scientific hypotheses, especially in cases of detection of weak signals in the presence of natural fluctuations, and for process studies with small ensembles. This is also true where ancillary data from meteorological analyses are required, which have their own sampling limitations and uncertainties. This study will review two investigations pertaining to measurements of water vapor in the mid-troposphere and lower stratosphere that mix satellite observations with observations from other sources. The focus of the mid-troposphere analysis is to obtain improved estimates of water vapor at the instant of a sounding satellite overpass. The lower stratosphere work examines the uncertainty inherent in a small ensemble of anomalously elevated lower stratospheric water vapor observations when meteorological analysis products and aircraft in situ observations are required for interpretation.",

            "abstract": "Due to the role of water vapor and clouds in positive feedback mechanisms, water vapor is a key player in the future of Arctic climate. Ecosystems and human societies are vulnerable to climate change through even minor changes in precipitation patterns, including the occurrence of extreme events. It is therefore essential to monitor, understand and model correctly the mechanisms of transport of moisture, at the regional scale.\nWater isotopes – the relative abundance of heavy and light water in the atmosphere – hold the key to understanding the physical processes influencing future Arctic climate. Water isotope observations in the atmosphere are a modern analog to the Rosetta Stone for understanding the processes involved in evaporation, moisture transport, cloud formation and to track moisture origin.\nIndeed, technological progress now allows continuous, in situ or remote sensing monitoring of water isotopic composition. In parallel, a growing number of atmospheric circulation models are equipped with the explicit modeling of water stable isotopes, allowing evaluation at the process scale.\nWe present here data obtained through national or bi-national initiatives from stations onboard an icebreaker and land based stations in Greenland, Iceland, Svalbard, and Siberia – together forming an emerging international Arctic water vapor isotope network. Using water tagging and back trajectories we show water vapor of Arctic origin to have a high d-excess fingerprint. This show the potential of using water vapor isotopes as tracer for changes in the Arctic hydrological cycle. Using the network of monitoring stations we quantify using the isotopes advection of air masses and the key processes affecting the water vapor en-route between stations. We have successfully used the obtained atmospheric water vapor isotope observations to benchmark isotope-enabled general circulation models. This comparison allows us to address key processes of the atmospheric hydrological cycle for which their representation in the models should be improved.",

            "abstract": "We present the first high-resolution multiproxy reconstruction of the past 18,000 years of oceanic redox variability in the southeastern Gulf of California (GC) and eastern Pacific. The variation in oxygen content prove to be a crucial regulator responsible for changes in biota distribution, water chemistry, physicochemical transformations of dissolved and particulate phases for trace elements in the water column, and formation of authigenic minerals, among other effects. The gravity core DIPAL-III T2 collected aboard the R/V “El Puma” (UNAM) from Pescadero Basin, located within the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) of the southern GC, was thoroughly studied in terms of C, S, trace element and Fe speciation. After establishing the age-model of the marine sediments, the produced data revealed two clear episodes of peleoceanographic variability, associated with changes in hypoxia. The first period (18.0 - 11.6 cal kyr BP), represented by massive sediments, points to a time with an oxygenated water column and moderate productivity, elucidated by low Corg, high S and a relatively low redox sensitive trace element content (Mo and U). The second (11.6 cal kyr BP - present), easily perceived by a clear lamination pattern, indicates a suboxic/anoxic episode, evidenced by higher Corg, Mo and U, among others. A clear dramatic shift is distinctly observable between these periods for most of the redox-proxies. This shift is related to the changes in sea-level that immediately followed the Last Glacial Maximum, when the ice sheets began to melt. This transitioned Pescadero hydrochemistry from a shallow well-ventilated basin (prior to 11.6 cal kyr BP) to a deep OMZ system. When compared to renowned marine sedimentary records, such as Cariaco and Guaymas basins, some events became more eminent than others. In the particular case of the Younger Dryas (YD) stadial and Bolling Allerod (BA) interstadial, the Corg, S and some trace element patterns were similar among basins even from different climatic and oceanographic settings. The latter provides evidence that the mentioned paleoceanographic events had a wider influence than previously reported.",

            "abstract": "The injection of CO2 into CH4-hydrate-bearing sediments has the potential to drive natural gas production and simultaneously sequester CO2 by hydrate conversion. The process aims at maintaining the in situ hydrate saturation and structure and causing limited impact on soil hydraulic properties and geomechanical stability. However, to increase hydrate conversion yields and rates it must potentially be assisted by thermal stimulation or depressurization. Further, secondary formation of CO2-rich hydrates from pore water and injected CO2 enhances hydrate conversion and CH4 production yields [1]. Technical stimulation and secondary hydrate formation add significant complexity to the bulk conversion process resulting in spatial and temporal effects on hydraulic and geomechanical properties that cannot be predicted by current reservoir simulation codes. In a combined experimental and numerical approach, it is our objective to elucidate both hydraulic and mechanical effects of CO2 injection and CH4-CO2-hydrate conversion in CH4-hydrate bearing soils. For the experimental approach we used various high-pressure flow-through systems equipped with different online and in situ monitoring tools (e.g. Raman microscopy, MRI and ERT). One particular focus was the design of triaxial cell experimental systems, which enable us to study sample behavior even during large deformations and particle flow. We present results from various flow-through high-pressure experimental studies on different scales, which indicate that hydraulic and geomechanical properties of hydrate-bearing sediments are drastically altered during and after injection of CO2. We discuss the results in light of the competing processes of hydrate dissociation, hydrate conversion and secondary hydrate formation. Our results will also contribute to the understanding of effects of temperature and pressure changes leading to dissociation of gas hydrates in ocean and permafrost systems.\n[1] Deusner C, Bigalke N, Kossel E, Haeckel M.

            "abstract": "It is quite important to measure the ground tilt for geophysics research and great civil engineering projects. In application, the drift of the instrument should be carefully considered, and the ground tilt which is measured by a low drift tiltmeter will be more valuable for the earthquake prediction research and the high building safety evaluation. The electrostatic suspension two-dimension tiltmeter is a new style tiltmeter. The key part of this tiltmeter is a sandwich type sensor-head which is composed of a proof mass and six pairs of capacitor electrode plates. By six-degree-of-freedom control, the proof mass will be maintained motionless in the middle of electrode plates by the electrostatic force. In the vertical direction, a high control voltage is required to perform the electrostatic suspension of the mass under gravity condition. While in the horizontal direction, the control voltage can be relatively low because the electrostatic force is just used to balance the component of gravity in such direction, which is caused by the tilt of the instrument base. By measuring the control voltage of the two horizontal directions, the ground tilt in these two directions can be obtained. Comparing with the traditional pendulous tiltmeters, the mechanical drift, which is the main shortcoming of the traditional pendulous tiltmeters, can be overcome in this new tiltmeter, because the proof mass will be suspended by the electrostatic force, there will be no mechanical linkage between the proof mass and the frame. Because of the advantage of low drift, it is quite suitable to use this new tiltmeter for earthquake prediction research and high building safety evaluation.",

            "abstract": "Many models show that the relative intensity of stratification is a primary variable governing the sequestration and release of carbon from the ocean over ice ages. The wide-scale observations necessary to test these model-derived hypotheses are not yet sufficient, but sedimentary depth transects represent a promising approach for making progress. Here we present new glacial and late Holocene stable isotopic and trace metal data from benthic foraminifera collected from a detailed depth transect from the deep SE Atlantic. Following the approach developed in Lund et al. (2011) [1] for δ18O, we use conservative tracers (e.g. δ18O and Mg/Ca) to constrain the relative strength of meridional transport as compared to vertical diffusivity at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and during the late Holocene. We compare our new results from the SE Atlantic to a similar analysis of published depth profiles from other regions. These measurements, when combined with radiocarbon data for the same cores, provide insights into the relationship between alterations in deep/mid-depth stratification and changes in the ventilation of carbon in the deep ocean.\n[1] Lund, D.

            "abstract": "Synergies between the Visible Near Infrared/ Short Wave Infrared (VSWIR) and Thermal Infrared (TIR) spectra for identifying plant species’ foliar chemistry have been largely unexplored. Here we evaluate: 1) the capability of VSWIR and/or TIR spectra to predict levels of lignin, cellulose, nitrogen, leaf mass area, and water content; 2) whether these relationships between spectra and foliar chemistry can be extended to the reduced spectral resolution available in airborne and proposed spaceborne sensors, including the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), the Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES), and the Hyperspectral Thermal Imager (HyspIRI); and 3) how these predictive relationships might change seasonally and among plant functional types.\nIn the 2013 spring, summer, and fall seasons, fresh leaves from sixteen common shrub and tree species were sampled from the Sierra Nevada Mountains, the Central Valley, and coastal Santa Barbara. Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression analysis was used to relate spectral response at wavelengths from 0.3 µm to 15.4 µm to laboratory-measured biochemical properties. For each component, three PLS regression models were fit using different portions of the spectrum: VSWIR (0.3 - 2.5 µm), TIR (2.5 – 15.4 µm), and the entire spectrum (0.3 – 15.4 µm). Three additional models were fitted using spectra resampled to AVIRIS (0.4 - 2.5 µm), HyTES (7.5 – 12 µm), and HyspIRI (0.38 - 12 µm).\nThe majority of the highest performing models used either the TIR spectrum or entire spectrum. When using simulated sensor spectra, HyspIRI produced the highest performing models, followed by HyTES. From model results the combination of VSWIR and TIR increased the R2 of regression models compared to VSWIR alone, signifying that the inclusion of TIR data would improve predictions of foliar chemistry. Also, we found that model accuracy varied by seasons and across plant functional types. Models developed for all seasons resulted in a decreased R2 value or required twice the number of factors of a single season to explain the variance. These analyses provide a quantitative estimate of the full spectrum’s potential to predict plant chemistry as it fluctuates seasonally.",

Spectral bands designed for daytime imaging are particularly useful for detecting and characterizing fires, flares and industrial heat sources. By measuring combustion source emitted radiances across a range of wavelengths, the nightfire algorithm is able to model the Planck curve, which makes it possible to estimate temperature, size, and radiant heat of subpixel combustion sources. The algorithm fits two Planck curves for the sub-pixel fire and the background in a detected pixel and estimates the fire temperature, area and radiative power. Combining one day of data from the Suomi NPP VIIRS sensor, the Nightfire algorithm can detect and characterize more than 10,000 fires on the night side of the Earth with temperatures ranging from 500 K to 2,500 K and active burn areas down to several square meters. The temperature histogram for the detected fires has two distinct peaks discriminating gas flares from biomass burning. The Nightfire algorithm has been successfully applied to nighttime scenes from the Landsat 8 OLI sensor which has 30 m spatial resolution and higher dynamic range than VIIRS. Global Nightfire detection products are produced daily and are available from the NOAA NGDC web site.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic interactions between rivers and floodplains produce off-channel chutes, whose presence can increase the ecological diversity of the valley floor. Detailed studies of the hydrologic exchanges between channels and floodplains are usually conducted in laboratory facilities, and studies documenting chute development are generally limited to qualitative observations. In this study, we use a reconstructed, gravel-bedded, meandering river as a laboratory for studying these mechanisms at field scale. Using an integrated field and modeling approach, we quantified the flow exchanges between the river channel and its floodplain during an overbank flood, and identified locations where flow had the capacity to erode floodplain chutes. Hydraulic measurements and modeling indicated high rates of flow exchange between the channel and floodplain, with flow rapidly decelerating as water was decanted from the channel onto the floodplain due to the frictional drag provided by substrate and riparian vegetation. Peak shear stresses were greatest downstream of the maxima in bend curvature, along the concave bank, where terrestrial LiDAR scans indicate initial floodplain chute formation. A second chute has developed across the convex bank of a meander bend, in a location where sediment accretion, point bar development and plant colonization have created divergent flow paths between the main channel and floodplain. In both cases, the off-channel chutes are evolving slowly during infrequent floods due to the coarse nature of the floodplain, though rapid chute formation would be more likely in finer-grained floodplains. The controls on chute formation at these locations include the river curvature, cross-stream position of the high velocity core, erodibility of the floodplain sediment, and the density of riparian vegetation.",

Unlike the traditional budgeting method, which compares simulations with and without emissions of the source(s) in question to quantify its impacts, the CMAQ-ISAM technique assigns tags to emissions of each source and tracks their evolution through physical and chemical processes to quantify the final ozone product yield from the source. Model simulations were performed for two episodes in winter 2013 of low and high ozone to provide better understanding of source contributions under different weather conditions. Due to the highly nonlinear ozone chemistry, results obtained from the two methods differed significantly. The growing oil and gas industry in the Uintah Basin is the largest contributor to the elevated zone (>75 ppb) observed in the Basin. This study therefore provides an insight into the impact of oil and gas industry on the ozone issue, and helps in determining effective control strategies.",

Although the Stripmap footprints are small, compared to those of past SAR satellites, we are nonetheless able to track subsidence/uplift cycles of the ~50 x 80 km Yellowstone caldera using multiple strips. The Stripmap data are also useful for measuring deformation associated with the area of the North Rim anomaly, an area of repeated uplift and subsidence, ~30 km in diameter near the intersection of the north caldera rim, north-trending Mammoth-Norris Corridor, and west-northwest trending seismic belt east of Hebgen Lake. We measured ~45 mm of uplift associated with an episode that occurred mostly during the winter of 2013-2014 (as verified by GPS), and ~15 mm of subsequent subsidence in the early summer of 2014. The TSX Stripmap data have also proven effective at measuring small-scale deformation features. Because of the high-resolution of the TSX Stripmap data, we have also been able to measure many small-scale deforming features in Yellowstone National Park that are associated with apparent aquifer discharge/recharge cycles, unstable slope movement, geyser basin deformation, and deformation related to other hydrothermal features. We present an example of ~3 cm of seasonal deformation likely resulting from water movement in and out of an aquifer along the southwest caldera rim. We also document subsidence of ~1 cm/yr in a circular area nearly 0.5 km across near the vent from the Pitchstone Plateau, a thick rhyolite flow that erupted nearly 70 ka. TSX data are instrumental in identifying the seasonal variation found in some of these features, and in measuring the small spatial areas of deformation associated with other features.",

            "abstract": "The Cascadia subduction zone of the Pacific Northwest terminates in the south at the Mendocino Triple Junction, a region of elevated seismic activity. Here, tectonically driven uplift is likely responsible for the formation of Holocene-aged marine terraces. In 1992, a M 7.1 thrust mainshock and two ~M 6.5 aftershocks occurred offshore of Cape Mendocino, resulting in 1.4 meters of uplift, measured from stranded intertidal species on uplifted wave-cut platforms. However, it is unknown whether these marine terraces formed due solely to large episodic coseismic uplift caused by moderately large to large magnitude earthquakes, orwhether interseismic deformation plays a role in their formation. Moreover, detailed mapping of these terraces has not been done since Merits (1996). For this study, we map a suite of four terraces and bedrock wave cut platforms between Cape Mendocino and Punta Gorda on the northern California coast near the town of Petrolia. By mapping both exposed and buried Holocene marine terraces we aim to discern the pattern of deformation causing their uplift, and determine whether uplift is related solely to episodic coseismic events, or both coseismic and interseismic deformation. Detailed mapping of the extent and elevation of both exposed and buried terraces is achieved by using real time kinematic (RTK) GPS surveying on base maps compiled using the 2009-2011 California Coastal Conservancy LIDAR. Preliminary results indicate formation predominantly from coseismic uplift in moderate magnitude subduction earthquakes. This work offers insight into understanding the upper plate crustal response to seismic events and interseismic periods in tectonically complex areas like the southern end of the Cascadia Subduction zone.",

            "abstract": "The Nuclear Waste Management Organization (NWMO) is responsible for implementing Adaptive Phased Management, the approach selected by the Government of Canada for long-term management of used nuclear fuel generated by Canadian nuclear reactors. In May 2010, the NWMO published and initiated a nine-step site selection process to find an informed and willing community to host a deep geological repository for Canada’s used nuclear fuel. The site selection process is designed to address a broad range of technical and social, economic and cultural factors. The suitability of candidate areas will be assessed in a stepwise manner over a period of many years and include three main steps: Initial Screenings; Preliminary Assessments; and Detailed Site Characterizations.\nThe Preliminary Assessment is conducted in two phases. NWMO has completed Phase 1 preliminary assessments for the first eight communities that entered into this step. While the Phase 1 desktop geoscientific assessments showed that each of the eight communities contains general areas that have the potential to satisfy the geoscientific safety requirements for hosting a deep geological repository, the assessment identified varying degrees of geoscientific complexity and uncertainty between communities, reflecting their different geological settings and structural histories. Phase 2 activities will include a sequence of high-resolution airborne geophysical surveys and focused geological field mapping to ground-truth lithology and structural features, followed by limited deep borehole drilling and testing. These activities will further evaluate the site’s ability to meet the safety functions that a site would need to ultimately satisfy in order to be considered suitable. This paper provides an update on the site evaluation process and describes the approach, methods and criteria that are being used to conduct the geoscientific Preliminary Assessments.",

            "abstract": "Coastal foredunes arise from interactions between vegetation and aeolian sand transport. Two of the most important grasses that influence dune growth and formation along the barrier islands of the U.S. mid-Atlantic coast are Ammophila breviligulata and Spartina patens. Variations in topography, distance to the shoreline and the associated biotic and abiotic stressors (e.g., salt spray, sand burial, soil chemistry, and competition from other plants) affect the survival of both species. Additionally, differences between the grasses in response to these stressors may directly control foredune morphology. Although a relationship between the cross-shore vegetation limit and maximum dune height has been developed (Durán and Moore 2013) we do not yet quantitatively understand how each grass affects dune formation and shape. We carried out a field experiment on Hog Island, VA and complementary model experiments to address gaps in our understanding of species control on vegetated foredunes.\nWe transplanted 120 plants of each species along two cross-shore transects (from foredune crest to the shoreline) to investigate the effects of topography and distance to the shoreline on vegetation growth. Throughout the growing season, we monitored the longest leaf of each transplant, the frontal and basal area of each transplant, and elevation at each transplant site to quantify vegetative growth and aeolian accretion along the each transect. We used these data to improve the coastal dune model presented by Durán and Moore (2013) so that it includes two grasses which more closely represent the growth characteristics of A. breviligulata and S. patens, specifically, rather than a generic dune-building grass species. These additions allow us to conduct simulations of dune development under varying initial abundances of morphologically important species, ranging from a dune populated only with A. breviligulata to one populated only with S. patens. Results from this coupled field and model experiment can be used to quantitatively understand the role of dune-building species on coastal foredune morphology.",

            "abstract": "Managed wetlands provide valuable ecosystem services, including carbon storage. Management practices, such as water-level manipulation and prescribed fire, can have a profound effect on the carbon dynamics of these ecosystems. Fluxes of carbon dioxide have been measured by eddy covariance methods over a subtropical peat marsh in Florida, USA since 2009. During this 5-year period, the site has experienced hydroperiods ranging from nine to twelve months. Hydroperiod was found to affect net ecosystem productivity, which was relatively low (70-130 grams carbon per square meter) in years with periodic drying events and much higher (300-600 grams carbon per square meter) during years with constant marsh inundation. The site experienced a prescribed fire in Spring of 2014, which consumed approximately 80% of the aboveground biomass (800 grams carbon per square meter). In addition to the carbon released by the fire, photosynthetic uptake during what would normally be the most productive part of the year was reduced relative to previous years due to low leaf area. These results illustrate how management practices can affect carbon sequestration, which is important for both atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and maintenance of peat topography.",

            "abstract": "Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in the United States. The total surface area is 9920 square kilometers of which 7540 square kilometers are shallower than 10 m. These shallow systems provide vital habitats and nursery grounds for numerous species of fish, shellfish, and wildlife. In the Chesapeake the shallow water systems have deteriorated in terms of healthy ecosystem levels and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV). Restoration of the shallow water systems requires an understanding of their dynamics including wave-current interactions, shoreline erosion, sediment suspension, biological and biogeochemical processes, sediment diagenesis, sediment-water exchange, and diel cycles of temperature, salinity, turbidity, alkalinity, chlorophyll, nutrients, and dissolved oxygen (DO). To this end, an extensive shallow water monitoring program has been implemented in the Chesapeake since 2003. The program includes bi-weekly cruises of nutrient sampling, a continuous monitoring network with electronic sensors collecting data at a 15 minute interval, and a unique data flow survey from moving boats that collect underway observations with a datum frequency of seconds. The data reveal large diel cycles, with chlorophyll varying between a few mg/l to hundreds of mg/l, DO between 0 to 20 mg/l (with saturation from 0 to 250%), turbidity between 0 to 1500 NTUs, and pH from 6.0 to 9.5, which demonstrate the highly dynamic nature in physical and biological process of the shallow water systems . In order to better understand the key mechanisms and processes of these shallow-water systems and to explore the monitoring data, we applied a coupled physical and water quality model to the Chester and Corsica tributaries. The physical model is the Unstructured Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) and the water quality model is the Integrated Compartment Model (ICM) which has 36 state variables such as phytoplankton, zooplankton, DO, nutrients, and various organic matter and sediment-water interactions. The simulated results show high patchiness in water quality properties due to micro- and meso-scale eddies caused by the meandering of the coastal line, which contribute to in part the temporal variability at a fixed station. Detailed information on monitoring data, and simulated results will be presented at the conference.",

With these parameters, key atmospheric quantities associated with wave energy dissipation are estimated.

By using methods of error analysis, we have investigated the uncertainties in gravity wave parameters, modeling/measuring their magnitude for temporal/spatial wave scales frequently recorded in nightglow images. The uncertainty equations demonstrated can be easily implemented in parameter estimation schemes by other aeronomy groups observing gravity waves via nightglow imagery. ",

            "abstract": "Planktonic foraminifera are widely used proxy carriers in paleoceanography. The flux of foraminiferal shells to the sea floor is not even throughout the year, creating a seasonal bias in the surface conditions recorded in an average fossil sample. This bias, and its changes through time, may account for an important part of the variability in paleoclimate records, but it is often ignored because of limited knowledge on the determinants of flux seasonality. To address this issue we have compiled a global dataset on shell flux seasonality from sediment traps. The database contains 38 globally distributed time series of at least one year and covers >20 species. We use periodic regression to objectively determine peak flux timing and amplitude. Significant seasonality is observed in 80 % of the cases studied and we distinguish three distinct groups of foraminifera with different modes of seasonality. This division is independent of ocean basin or upwelling and appears to reflect three principle patterns of phenology.\nWarm-water and symbiont-bearing species change flux seasonality by concentrating a larger proportion of the annual flux in a shorter period in colder water. Peak flux timing appears random at high temperatures and shifts towards autumn at lower temperatures. Seasonal flux variability is small at high temperatures (within their optimal range) resulting in a negligible seasonal bias. In colder waters the timing appear constant and the strength of the peak flux can be predicted by temperature. Temperate and cold-water dwellers adjust their peak timing with average temperature. Peak flux in these species occurs later during the year at lower temperatures and follows chlorophyll maxima by approximately a month. The strength of peak flux is similar across the temperature range, but the association with productivity allows for prediction of the timing of peak flux. Peak flux of deep-dwelling seems to occur in spring independent of temperature, which may agree with a longer reproductive cycle, and show a tendency for increased peak prominence at higher temperatures. These observations shed new light on the factors explaining seasonal variability in the shell flux of planktonic foraminifera and will aid to improve paleoceanographic reconstructions by allowing prediction of temporal changes in seasonality.",

            "abstract": "We present microstructural, LPO, and misorientation data from EBSD analyses to interpret the deformation mechanisms of naturally deformed plagioclase in an amphibolite-facies extensional shear zone within oceanic crust. Textural data and mineral chemistry data for thermometry were acquired on samples of gabbro mylonite collected from the footwall of the Atlantis Bank oceanic core complex; we focus on a monophase plagioclase layer with a high ratio of recrystallized matrix grains to porphyroclasts.\nSample microstructures are subdivided into three regions: seven porphyroclasts, recrystallized grains immediately adjacent to those porphyroclasts, and the population of recrystallized matrix grains. All porphyroclasts exhibit subgrain development and show clustering of low-angle (3-10º) misorientation axes within the {010} plane, consistent with slip on {010}. However, only one porphyroclast is oriented for operation of the {010}<001> easy slip system. The small recrystallized grains immediately adjacent to the porphyroclasts do not show a host control relationship with their respective porphyroclasts, and these grains are also smaller than the subgrains of the porphyroclasts. Recrystallized matrix grains are fine-grained (mean grain size ~ 8 μm) and slightly elongate parallel to foliation, with local misorientations concentrated along grain boundaries and junctions. They exhibit a weak, nonrandom LPO suggesting the activity of the {111}<110> slip system, and their neighbor-pair misorientations are shifted towards higher angles.\nWe interpret the distinctive relationships between the three regions as evidence of a transition from dislocation creep to dislocation-accommodated grain boundary sliding (DisGBS). Porphyroclast subgrains and misorientation axes suggest the operation of dislocation creep, but the lack of host control in the adjacent recrystallized grains precludes grain size reduction through subgrain rotation recrystallization alone. High driving force bulge nucleation likely contributed to the grain size reduction and recrystallization of matrix grains, triggering the onset of grain size sensitive DisGBS. We suggest that the transition between deformation mechanisms is an effective weakening mechanism that contributed to development of the shear zone.",

We are testing an approach to automated, on-the-fly quality control (QC) to aid in the identification of poorly performing sensor channels prior to beam-forming in routine event detection or location processing. The idea stems from methods used for large computer servers, when monitoring traffic at enormous numbers of nodes is impractical on a node-by-node basis, so the dimensionality of the node traffic is instead monitored for anomalies that could represent malware, cyber-attacks or other problems. The technique relies upon the use of subspace dimensionality or principal components of the overall system traffic. The subspace technique is not new to seismology, but its most common application has been limited to comparing waveforms to an a priori collection of templates for detecting highly similar events in a swarm or seismic cluster. We examine the signal dimension in similar way to the method addressing node traffic anomalies in large computer systems. We explore the effects of malfunctioning channels on the dimension of the data and its derivatives, and how to leverage this effect for identifying bad array elements. We show preliminary results applied to arrays in Kazakhstan (Makanchi) and Argentina (Malargue).",

            "abstract": "Recent intensification of Arctic amplification can be strongly connected to positive feedback relating black carbon deposition to sea ice surface albedo. In addition to soot deposition on the ice and snow pack, ice algal chlorophyll is likely to compete as an absorber and redistributor of energy. Hence, solar radiation absorption by chlorophyll and some components of organic macromolecules in/under the ice column is currently being examined to determine the level of influence on predicted rate of ice loss.\nHigh amounts of organic macromolecules and chlorophyll are produced in global sea ice by the bottom microbial community and also in vertically distributed layers where substantial biological activities take place. Brine channeling in columnar ice can allow for upward flow of nutrients which leads to greater primary production in the presence of moderate light.\nModeling of the sea-ice processes in tandem with experiments and field observations promises rapid progress in enhancing Arctic ice predictions. We are designing and conducting global climate model experiments to determine the impact of organic macromolecules and chlorophyll on Arctic sea ice. Influences on brine network permeability and radiation/albedo will be considered in this exercise.\nAbsorption by anthropogenic materials such as soot and black carbon will be compared with that of natural pigments. We will indicate areas of soot and biological absorption dominance in the sense of single scattering, then couple into a full radiation transfer scheme to attribute the various contributions to polar climate change amplification. The work prepares us to study more traditional issues such as chlorophyll warming of the pack periphery and chemical effects of the flow of organics from ice internal communities. The experiments started in the Arctic will broaden to include Antarctic sea ice and shelves. Results from the Arctic simulations will be presented.",

However mathematical extrapolation combined with different measurement methods can provide realistic three-dimensional fields of highly heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity (K). This study demonstrates an approach to evaluate the time, cost, and efficiency of subsurface K characterization. We quantify the value of different data sets at the highly heterogeneous Macro Dispersion Experiment (MADE) Site in Mississippi, which is a flagship test site that has been used for several macro- and small-scale tracer tests that revealed non-Gaussian tracer behavior. Tracer data collected at the site are compared to models that are based on different types and resolution of geophysical and hydrologic data. We present a cost-benefit analysis of several techniques including: 1) flowmeter K data, 2) direct-push K data, 3) ground penetrating radar, and 4) two stochastic methods to generate K fields. This research provides an initial assessment of the level of data necessary to accurately simulate solute transport with the traditional advection dispersion equation; it also provides a basis to design lower cost and more efficient remediation schemes at highly heterogeneous sites.",

In the Beaufort Sea, deformation is dominated by thin-skinned folding and thrusting of Paleocene to Oligocene sediments that is sourced from the British Mountains. Onshore, Paleogene deformation overprints multiple older structural events. The low temperature time history of the onshore Paleogene structures will be determined through U-Th/He dating of apatites (AHe). The results will contribute to better understanding of the timing of the maturation and migration of hydrocarbons in the Beaufort Sea. Previous work on the thermal history of northern Yukon and the North Slope of Alaska provides a regional framework for the region’s low temperature-time history. These regional studies of the northern Yukon and Alaska yielded Paleocene to Eocene (60Ma – 40Ma) apatite fission track (AFT) cooling ages that progressively young to the north, consistent with geological evidence for northward propagating deformation. The British Mountains consist of Neoproterozoic to early Paleozoic marine sediments that are intruded by scattered Devonian plutons; both rock types will be included in the study.\nThis study aims to improve the understanding of the Paleogene tectonic activity of the British Mountains and the deformation history of the Beaufort fold belt. The two data sets, existing AFT and new AHe results, will be both be included in the interpretation of the study area. We will present AHe data to better constrain the onshore exhumation and deformation rates at low temperatures (~60-90°C). A sampled transect through the British mountains, along the Firth River valley will provide good resolution on these rates of the deformation. The results will be used to relate the onshore time-temperature history with the development of offshore structures in the Arctic Canadian Cordillera.",

            "abstract": "Addition of an organic substrate to provide an electron donor and carbon source can be very effective at stimulating enhanced reductive bioremediation (ERB) of chlorinated solvents, energetics, and other groundwater contaminants. However, the quantity of electron donor added is usually based on an individual’s or company’s “rule of thumb” rather than considering site-specific conditions such as groundwater velocity, carbon source, and upgradient electron acceptor concentrations, potentially leading to unnecessarily large amounts of carbon injected. Mass balance estimates indicate that over 99% of electrons donated go to electron acceptors other than the primary contaminants. Thus, injecting excessive amounts of organic carbon can lead to a persistent reducing zone, releasing elevated levels of dissolved manganese, iron, methane, and sometimes arsenic. Monitoring data on carbon injections and electron acceptors were collected from 33 ERB sites. Two approaches were then used to evaluate carbon longevity and the time required to return to near-oxic conditions at an ERB site. The first method employed a simple mass balance approach, using such input parameters as groundwater velocity, upgradient electron acceptors, and amount of carbon injected. In the second approach, a combined flow, transport and geochemical model was developed using PHT3D to estimate the impact of ERB on secondary water quality impacts (SWQIs; e.g., methane production, iron mobilization and transport, etc.) The model was originally developed for use in estimating SWQIs released from petroleum sites, but has since been modified for use at ERB sites. The ERB site to be studied is a perchlorate release site in Elkton, Maryland where 840 lbs of an emulsified vegetable oil was injected. The results from the simple mass balance approach and PHT3D model will be compared and used to identify conditions where the simplified approach may be appropriate.",

            "abstract": "The nocturnal low-level jet (LLJ) is a warm-season atmospheric boundary layer phenomenon common to the Great Plains of the United States and other places worldwide, typically in regions east of mountain ranges. Low-level jets develop around sunset in fair weather conditions conducive to strong radiational cooling, reach peak intensity in the pre-dawn hours, and then dissipate with the onset of daytime convective mixing. In this study we consider the LLJ as a diurnal oscillation of a stably stratified atmosphere overlying a planar slope on the rotating Earth. The oscillations arise from diurnal cycles in both the heating of the slope (mechanism proposed by Holton in 1967) and the turbulent mixing (mechanism proposed by Blackadar in 1957). The governing equations are the equations of motion, incompressibility condition, and thermal energy in the Boussinesq approximation, with turbulent heat and momentum exchange parameterized through spatially constant but diurnally varying turbulent diffusion coefficients (diffusivities). Analytical solutions are obtained for diffusivities with piecewise constant waveforms (step-changes at sunrise and sunset) and slope temperatures/buoyancies with piecewise linear waveforms (saw-tooth function with minimum at sunrise and maximum before sunset). The jet characteristics are governed by eleven parameters: slope angle, Coriolis parameter, environmental buoyancy frequency, geostrophic wind strength, daytime and nighttime diffusivities, maximum (daytime) and minimum (nighttime) slope buoyancies, duration of daylight, lag time between peak slope buoyancy and sunset, and a Newtonian cooling time scale. An exploration of the parameter space yields results that are broadly consistent with findings particular to the Holton and Blackadar theories, and agree with climatological observations, for example, that stronger jets tend to occur over slopes of 0.15-0.25 degrees characteristic of the Great Plains. The solutions also yield intriguing predictions that peak jet strength increases with attenuation of the minimum surface buoyancy, and that the single most important parameter determining jet height is the nighttime diffusivity, with weaker nightime diffusion associated with smaller jet heights. These and other highlights will be discussed in the presentation.",

            "abstract": "The carbonate compensation depth (CCD) is the depth below which negligible calcium carbonate is preserved in marine sediments. The long-term position of the CCD is often considered to be a powerful constraint on palaeoclimate and atmospheric CO2 concentration due to the requirement that carbonate burial balance riverine weathering over long timescales. The requirement that weathering and burial be in balance is clear, but it is less certain that burial compensates for changes in weathering via shoaling or deepening of the CCD. Because most carbonate burial occurs well above the CCD , changes in weathering fluxes may be primarily accommodated by increasing or decreasing carbonate burial at shallower depths, i.e., at or near the lysocline, the depth range over which carbonate dissolution markedly increases. Indeed, recent earth system modelling studies have suggested that the position of the CCD is relatively insensitive to changes in atmospheric pCO2. Additionally, studies have questioned the nature and strength of the relationship between the CCD, carbonate saturation state in the water column, and lysocline. To test the relationship between palaeoclimate and the location of the CCD, we reconstructed the global, long-term CCD behaviour across major Cenozoic climate transitions: the late Paleocene - early Eocene long-term warming trend (study interval ~58 to 49 Ma) and the late Eocene - early Oligocene cooling and glaciation (study interval ~38 to 27 Ma). We use Earth system modelling (GENIE) to explore the links between atmospheric pCO2 and the CCD, isolating and teasing apart the roles of total dissolved inorganic carbon, temperature, circulation, and productivity in determining the CCD.",

When Bw > 1, deposition and erosion derived from changes in flow depth that produce accelerations akin to a kinematic wave. When Bw < 1, shear stress is determined by changes in slope, which produces diffusional evolution. We conduct a survey of Bw for 41 alluvial bedform studies ranging in scale from dunes to river deltas, from both field and experimental studies. For field-scale measurements, we find that dunes have Bw > 140, braid bars range between 13 and 37, meanders wavelengths range between 13 and 18, river mouth processes range between 8 and 30, and delta avulsions cluster around 1, as predicted by theory. Importantly, Bw >> 1 for field-scale alluvial bedforms appears to be a rule. Further, bedforms that are traditionally simple to recreate in physical experiments have strong overlap between lab and field scales, while experimental meanders and river mouth processes, which have been difficult to recreate in the lab, have much smaller Bw in the lab than in the field. We present the theory of backwater scaling as a method for estimating sedimentary dimensions, and propose a potential solution to the difficulties of Bw scaling in the laboratory.",

            "abstract": "The presence of ferric iron (Fe3+) in the mantle plays a significant role in the oxygen fugacity (fO2) of the Earth’s interior. This has a wide range of implications for Earth related processes ranging from the composition of the atmosphere to magmatic phase relations during melting and crystallization processes [1]. A major source of Earth’s mantle magmas is spinel peridotite. Despite its low abundance, spinel (Fe3+/ƩFe = 15-34%, [2]) is the main contributor of Fe3+to the melt upon partial melting.\nAnalyses of Fe3+ on small areas of spinel and melt are required to study the Fe3+ behavior during partial melting of spinel peridotite. Fe K-edge X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) combines both high precision and small beam size, but requires standards with a wide range of Fe3+ content to obtain good calibration. Glasses with varying Fe3+ content are easily synthesized [3, 4]. Spinel, however, presents a challenge for experimental standards due to the low diffusion of Cr and Al preventing compositional homogeneity. Natural spinel standards are often used, but only cover a narrow Fe3+ range. Thus, there is a need for better experimental spinel standards over a wider range of fO2.\nOur study involves making experimental mantle spinels with variable Fe3+ content. We used a sol-gel auto-combustion method to synthesize our starting material [5]. FMQ-2, FMQ+0, and air fO2 conditions were established using a gas mixing furnace. Piston cylinder experiments were performed at 1.5GPa, and 1310 -1370°C to obtain solid material for XANES. To maintain distinct oxidizing conditions, three capsules were used: graphite for reduced, Re for intermediate and AuPd for oxidized conditions. The spinels were analyzed by Mössbauer spectroscopy. Fe3+/ƩFe ranged from 0.3 to 0.6. These values are consistent with the Fe edge position obtained using XANES analyses, between 7130 and 7132 eV, respectively. Our spinels are thus suitable standards for Fe3+ measurements in peridotite systems and can be used to determine Fe3+/ΣFe ratio of spinel during magma genesis from a peridotite source.\n[1] Canil et al.

Minerals such as columbite-tantalite (also referred to as COLTAN), wolframite, cassiterite and gold are important in electronics manufacturing and have a wide variety of other usages. Mining practices are frequently unsustainable and have significant impacts on the environment; moreover, in many locations, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo—the epicenter of the conflict mineral trade—major human rights violations are associated with the extraction and production of these minerals.\nBecause conflict minerals represent a relatively new issue, students in geology classes are frequently unfamiliar with the topic and commonly have little understanding of the concerns. In some cases they are completely unaware of the issues. In an introductory mineralogy class at the University of California, San Diego I have introduced a content module into my otherwise traditional curriculum that introduces students to conflict minerals, explains the issues, and delineates the problems our society will face with the continued uses of these natural resources. Most significantly, an assignment has been created and implemented in class that is paired with the content module and is designed to enhance and reinforce student learning. Its goal is to increase awareness of the societal and environmental issues surrounding conflict minerals.\nInitial results suggest (based on pre and post-tests) that our students have learned significantly from the combination of content, exercise, and assessment and that they are much better informed on the issues of conflict minerals. This model, including the exercise, can be modified and adapted for other introductory classes and learning settings.",

A common format of these data is as vegetation indices and of these; the most widely used is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). There are many examples where the NDVI has been assessed as a covariate in spatial models of ecosystem health, faunal habitat, faunal distribution and condition, forage quality and disease risk, to name but a few. Occasionally, such applications detach the NDVI from its theoretical underpinnings; there may be no consideration of surface phenomena affecting the radiation environment and causing change in red and near infrared (NIR) reflectance. In this paper, we revisit classic remote sensing research to determine for which environmental modeling applications the NDVI is likely to be meaningful. We collated data from multiple published research studies to characterize the relationships between NDVI and vegetation canopy variables (leaf area index, biomass, percentage cover and the fraction of absorbed radiation) over different vegetation types. Using these collated data sets, we discuss the physical basis of the relationships between NDVI and vegetation canopy variables, how and why these relationships differ and what this means for the usefulness of the NDVI as a proxy for Earth surface or climate variables. We conclude with a critique of the variables that NDVI has been used to replace as a proxy and show its success or failure as a proxy variable relates back to the simple relationships known to exist between NDVI and vegetation canopy variables.",

            "abstract": "Infiltration (spreading) basins are a central component of managed aquifer and recovery operations around the world. The concept is simple. Water is percolated into an aquifer where it can be withdrawn at a later date. However, managing infiltration basins can be complicated by entrapped air in sediments, strata of low permeability, clogging of the recharge surface, and biological growth, among other factors. Understanding the dynamics of percolation in light of these complicating factors provides a basis for making management decisions that increase recharge efficiency. As an aid to understanding percolation dynamics, fiber optic distribute temperature sensing (DTS) was used to track heat as a tracer of water movement in an infiltration basin. The diurnal variation of temperature in the basin was sensed at depth. The time lag between the oscillating temperature signal at the surface and at depth indicated the velocity of water percolation. DTS fiber optic cables were installed horizontally along the basin and vertically in boreholes to measure percolation behavior. The horizontal cable was installed in trenches at 0.3 and 1 m depth, and the vertical cable was installed using direct push technology. The vertical cable was tightly wound to produce a factor of 10 increase in spatial resolution of temperature measurements. Temperature was thus measured every meter across the basin and every 10 cm to a depth of 10 m. Data from the trenched cable suggested homogeneous percolation across the basin, but infiltration rates were a function of stage indicating non-ideal percolation. Vertical temperature monitoring showed significant lateral flow in sediments underlying the basin both during saturation and operation of the basin. Deflections in the vertical temperature profile corresponded with fine grained layers identified in core samples indicating a transient perched water table condition. The three-dimensional flow in this relatively homogenous surficial geology calls into question the relevance of simple wetting models for predicting percolation behavior in infiltration basins.",

Independent of climate change the population of the Indus basin will experience water scarcity due to demographic pressures [2]. Recent geophysical research focusing on the Karakoram has revealed patterns of change in both climate [3,4] and cryosphere [5,6] which diverge from the trajectories expected in a globally warming climate. Additional studies have underlined the influence of large-scale atmospheric circulation on glacier mass balance status [7,8].\nThis study identifies and quantifies a regional feature of atmospheric circulation, the latitudinal position of the westerly jet “immediately upstream” of the Karakoram, which has substantial influence of surface air temperature variability across the Himalayan Mountain Arc and adjacent Indo-Gangetic plains. Characteristics of this feature, and its correlation to local air temperatures, are compared amongst an ensemble of meteorological reanalyses: ERA-40, ERA-Interim, NCEP CFSR, NASA MERRA and JRA-55.\nCorrelations between the westerly jet position and local observations indicate a strong causal mechanism of short term near surface air temperature variability. Furthermore, the Karakoram and NW UIB respond differently during the Summer season to this circulation mode than both the plains of the lower Indus as well as the Central and Eastern Himalaya. This differentiated response provides a plausible explanation for differences in summer temperature trends along the Himalayan arc and by substantiating differences in melt season energy inputs provides a clear climatic mechanism to explain the “Karakoram anomaly.”\n[1] DOI:10.1126/science.330.6004.585-a\n[2] DOI:10.5194/hess-14-1669-2010\n[3] DOI:10.1175/JCLI3860.1\n[4] DOI:10.3354/cr00957\n[5] DOI:10.1038/ngeo1450\n[6] DOI:10.1038/nature11324\n[7] DOI:10.1038/nclimate1580\n[8] DOI:10.1038/nclimate2055",

Our SANS results show that scattering intensity of smaller pores (< 20 nm)/larger Q values of shale samples increase systematically as temperature increase during pyrolysis from 250 oC to 600oC (Fig.1a). These results in combination with hydrocarbon fractions measurements during the same process (Fig. 1b) provide a quantitative relation between pore characteristics and hydrocarbons generation. Our results indicate that hydrocarbon expulsion primarily causes the observed changes in smaller pores. They also demonstrate that due to its sensitivity to hydrogen, SANS locates all pores whether the pore is filled or not with hydrocarbons. Thus, SANS is particularly suited for probing hydrocarbon behavior in tight shale reservoirs and the factors that impact their pore dynamics for the petroleum industry.",

            "abstract": "Spectral Induced Polarization (SIP) is a geophysical method sensitive to water content, saturation and grain size distribution. It could be used as an alternative to nuclear probes to assess the compaction of soils in road works. To evaluate the potential of SIP as a practical tool, we designed an experiment for complex conductivity measurements on unsaturated soil samples.\nLiterature presents a large variety of sample holders and designs, each depending on the context. Although we might find some precise description about the sample holder, exact replication is not always possible. Furthermore, the potential measurements are often done using custom-made Ag/AgCl electrodes and very few indications are given on their reliability with time and temperature. Our objective is to perform complex conductivity measurements on soil samples compacted in a PVC cylindrical mould (10 cm-long, 5 cm-diameter) according to geotechnical standards. To expect homogeneous current density, electrical current is transmitted through the sample via chambers filled with agar gel. Agar gel is a good non-polarizable conductor within the frequency range (1 mHz -20kHz). Its electrical properties are slightly known. We measured increasing of agar-agar electrical conductivity in time. We modelled the influence of this variation on the measurement. If the electrodes are located on the sample, it is minimized. Because of the dimensions at stake and the need for simple design, potential electrodes are located outside the sample, hence the gel contributes to the measurements. Since the gel is fairly conductive, we expect to overestimate the sample conductivity.\nPotential electrodes are non-polarizable Ag/AgCl electrodes. To avoid any leakage, the KCl solution in the electrodes is replaced by saturated KCl-agar gel. These electrodes are low cost and show a low, stable, self-potential (<1mV). In addition, the technique of making electrode can be easily reproduced and storage and maintenance are simple. We measured a variation of less than 1 mS/m of the electrolyte conductivity during the time of measurement (~1h40) for a conductivity range 25-100 mS/m, showing no ionic contamination of the solution by the electrodes. An improvement to the cell design would be to control the internal temperature of the sample.",

            "abstract": "Any model of an ocean-terminating ice mass requires a frontal boundary condition, often referred to as a \"calving law\". The choice of this boundary condition can have complex and poorly-understood effects on the behaviour of the system. Despite this, calving laws are often chosen based on numerical convenience or fashions in the literature. This can often lead to predictions which have \"hidden dependencies\" on the particular choice of calving law.\nAs an attempt to alleviate this problem, I will show results from a wide variety of calving laws, applied to tidewater glacier scenarios. I will demonstrate how the decadal-scale stability of a tidewater system can put constraints on possible calving laws, and how certain observational phenomena, such as the presence of \"pinning points\" are largely independent of the choice of calving law.\nThese results can be used by practitioners to decide on appropriate calving laws for the specific problems at hand. They should also be useful to help direct research into new calving laws, and to guide our conception of what an ideal calving law should look like.",

            "abstract": "A forty-year climate record from the NOAA Global Monitoring Division’s (GMD) Barrow Observatory (BRW) in Alaska shows a trend toward earlier spring snowmelt and a lengthening snow-free season. The snow-free season is defined as the number of days between the date of snow disappearance in spring (snow-out date), and the first snow-in date in autumn. A longer snow-free season impacts biogeochemical cycles and habitats and influences permafrost temperatures. Vegetation appears to be thriving at BRW due an extended growing season, evidenced by recent higher peak NDVI values.\nThe timing of snow disappearance each year can influence the net energy budget for an entire season. Feedbacks involving the change in surface albedo may enhance or diminish any response, which may be manifested in the regional temperature regime. The most important factor determining snow-out date appears to be the amount of winter snow accumulation; however, changes in cloud properties, and adjacent sea ice and ground station conditions likely play a role in that date. Stone et al (2002) estimated an increase in total radiative energy of about 1% per day for each day the melt date advanced (became earlier) at BRW.\nAlthough the 40-year record shows a trend toward warming and earlier snowmelt, analyzing the time series for just the last 20 years reveals a tendency towards later melt in the spring; since 1990 it has been essentially flat, although still a few days earlier than the first two decades. Despite a significantly warmer winter and spring in 2014 at BRW, the melt was 11 days later than in 2013, due mostly to differences in snow accumulation, with 2014 having about 80% more snow than the year prior.\nAt BRW and two other Arctic locations where GMD monitors snow albedo, Alert, Canada, and Tiksi, Russia, snow-in dates are now occurring later, resulting in an increased length of the snow-free season. This appears to be a significant Arctic-wide phenomenon. Preliminary analyses of the corresponding surface radiation and temperature at these sites indicate that the temperature-albedo feedback is at play, with longer snow-free seasons resulting in enhanced net energy, warming the boundary layer air and impacting permafrost. Key factors controlling the annual snow cycle at BRW will be identified and an estimate of the radiative impact of the observed trend presented.",

            "abstract": "Significant changes in Arctic sea ice extent have been observed in recent years, particularly at the end of the summer. Climate models that have a reasonable late 20th century Arctic climate, forecast ice-free summers in the Arctic before the end of this century. While these models agree on the decline of sea ice extent and the likelihood of a largely seasonal Arctic sea ice cover, the pattern of the sea ice loss and marginal ice zone locations predicted by different models varies widely. Narrowing the uncertainty implicit in these model disagreements is an important contribution to the accuracy of global climate projections. To this end we track the boundary between first and multi-year ice (i.e. the minimum September sea-ice edge position) using Lagrangian back and forward trajectories in both the instrumental record and GCMs participating in the IPCC-AR5. We use the trajectories to quantify the magnitude and interannual variability in the thermodynamic and dynamic (ice export) ice loss, the amount and geographical distribution of multiyear ice melt and first year promotion to second year ice. Results clearly highlight the importance of pre-conditioning (previous winter ice export) on the following summer minimum ice extent. Assessing whether climate models reproduce the correct dynamics of the MIZ can increase our confidence in climate forecasts.",

            "abstract": "Microbial habitability in extreme environments on Earth is described by microscale geochemical conditions that constrain metabolic niches in concert with long-term habitat stability that is governed by dynamic geologic processes. Using terrestrial analogs to identify habitable martian environments requires correlating microscale geochemical constraints with reconstructions of past martian environments that are based on global-scale observations. While past martian environments can be characterized by primary parameters (e.g. pH, redox, mineralogy, thermal history), microbial habitability on Earth is a complex function of both primary and derived parameters (e.g. metabolic reaction energetics, chemical & thermal gradients, flow dynamics). In recent years we have been investigating acid-sulfate fumaroles at the Mars analog site, Cerro Negro Volcano, Nicaragua, where habitability is constrained by steep thermal gradients, spatially- and temporally-variable vent dynamics, and limited water and nutrient availability. The most common niche identified thus far is found in fumaroles that host mixed photosynthetic and chemosynthetic endolithic microbial communities. One such endolith is dominated by acidic red algae (Cyanidiales), aerobic bacterial heterotrophs (Ktedonobacteria), and archaeal thermoacidophiles (Hyperthermus, Caldisphaera, and Thermofilum). An analysis of the metabolic structure suggests that primary production by the red algae supports the growth of heterotrophic thermoacidophiles. Diversification among the chemoheterotrophs with respect to temperature and oxygen tolerance suggests community adaptation to environmental gradients or variable venting dynamics. Furthermore, individual cells within the endolith are silica-encrusted, providing the possibility for biosignature formation and preservation. Putative hydrothermal environments on early Mars with similar conditions could have supported endolithic communities with comparable metabolic strategies. Even on a generally cold and dry Mars, volcanic craters likely provided long-lived warm and wet conditions that could have supported diverse assemblages of thermoacidophilic organisms with various metabolic strategies adapted to environmental conditions of acid-sulfate fumaroles.",

            "abstract": "Across the Western U.S., declining snowpacks have resulted in increased water limitation, leading to reduced productivity in high elevation forests. While our current understanding of how forests respond to climate change is typically focused on measuring/modeling the physiological responses and climate feedbacks, our study aims to combine physiology with hydrology to examine how landscape topography modulates the sensitivity of forests to climate. In a forested watershed in Western Montana, we linked climate variability to the physical watershed characteristics and the physiological response of vegetation to examine forest transpiration and productivity rates. Across the entire watershed, we found a strong relationship between productivity and the topographic wetness index, a proxy for soil moisture storage. However, this relationship was highly dependent on the intensity of solar radiation, suggesting that at high elevations productivity was limited by temperature, while at low elevations productivity was limited by moisture. In order to identify the mechanisms responsible for this relationship, we then examined how different coniferous species respond to changing environmental and hydrologic regimes. We first examined transpiration and productivity rates at the hillslope scale at four plots, ranging in elevation and aspect across the watershed. We found trees growing in the hollows had higher transpiration and productivity rates than trees growing in the side slope, but that these differences were more pronounced at lower elevations. We then used oxygen isotope to examine water source use by different species across the watershed. We found that trees growing in the hollows used snowmelt for a longer period. This was most likely due to upslope subsidies of snowmelt water to the hollow areas. However, we found that trees growing at lower elevations used proportionally more snowmelt than trees at the higher elevations. This was most likely due to the trees at lower elevation depending on deeper, more reliable water when the upper soils dried down during midsummer. These observations suggest that landscape topography influences the availability of soil water, which influences tree transpiration and productivity rates, thereby leading to watershed patterns of productivity.",

Less climate research has been devoted to heat indices that consider the joint hazard posed by high temperatures and high humidity, even though heat indices are being prioritized by utility providers and public health officials. This paper evaluates how well CMIP5 models are able to reproduce the large-scale features and surface conditions associated with joint high heat and humidity events in the Northeast U.S. Projected changes in heat indices are also shown both for the full set of CMIP5 models and for a subset of models that best reproduce the statistics of historical high heat index events. The importance of considering the relationship between 1) temperature and humidity extremes and 2) projected changes in extreme temperature and humidity extremes, rather than investigating each variable independently, will be emphasized. Potential impacts of the findings on human mortality and energy consumption will be briefly discussed.",

            "abstract": "Evaporation and transpiration are the two main processes involved in water transfer from vegetated and non-vegetated areas to the atmosphere. Evapotranspiration (ET) from the Earth’s vegetation constitutes 88% of the total terrestrial ET, and returns more than 50% of terrestrial precipitation to the atmosphere (Oki and Kane, 2006); therefore it plays a key role in both the hydrological cycle and the energy balance of the land surface. In Arctic regions, surface-atmosphere exchanges due to ET are estimated from water balance computations to be about 74% of summer precipitation or 50% of annual precipitation. Even though ET is a significant component of the hydrologic cycle in this region, these bulk estimates do not accurately account for spatial and temporal variability due to vegetation type, topography, etc. (Kane and Yang, 2004).\nIn this work we present the implementation of the Two-Source Energy Balance method, TSEB (Norman et al., 1995), in two Alaska Arctic tundra settings, as a base-line to retrieve energy fluxes at the regional scale from remote sensing imagery. In order to calibrate and validate the model, four flux towers located at the Imanvait Creek and the Anaktuvuk river were used. The TSEB model mainly requires meteorological inputs as well as land surface temperature (LST) and leaf area index (LAI) data. In this study, TSEB was run from late May to early September from 2008 to 2011 in all sky conditions using half hour intervals of meteorological data from the flux tower, and the LST derived from the four component net radiation instrument. TERRA/AQUA MODIS LAI daily product (MOD15/MYD15) was used as LAI input data. Results show an acceptable agreement between the TSEB model and flux tower data. RMSE obtained in the case of net radiation, latent heat, sensible heat and soil heat fluxes was 12, 51, 60 and 27 W/m2. Further efforts will be focused on the daily energy flux integration through implementation of the DTD model (Norman et al., 2000).",

Mineral dust aerosol exert a strong influence on formation of cirrus clouds by acting as efficient ice nuclei. Giant aerosol larger than ~10 microns can dominate condensational growth inside warm clouds and affect precipitation rates. Airborne measurements of aerosol concentration and single particle composition were conducted inside smoke plumes from fires originating in North America, Asia, and Central American. Sub- and supermicron mineral dust concentrations were strongly correlated with biomass burning particle concentrations, both within strong fire plumes and in the background troposphere. Dust concentrations varied with fire intensity and vegetation type. In general, western US wildfires emitted more dust than eastern US and Central American fires. Dust concentrations inside plumes were strongly enhanced relative to background air, demonstrating that biomass burning can provide a significant source of potential ice nuclei to the free troposphere. However, dust particles emitted from fires were coated with more organic carbon material than dust from other sources, which may reduce their ability to act as ice nuclei. Giant aerosol particles up to several 100 microns in size were also observed within some fire plumes and could account for 50% of the particle volume. Particle images show irregular shapes and suggest ash and fibrous plant material. Giant aerosol persisted inside plumes in the free troposphere for 100’s of km downwind from fire sources, indicating that particles must have low density to remain aloft. This combination of direct injection above the boundary layer and reduced depositional loss provides a regional source of particles that may act as giant cloud condensation nuclei.",

            "abstract": "In the western Great Plains, where old upland trees are scarce, rings of riparian trees provide an important opportunity for reconstructing past river flow and climate. We present data from 489 plains cottonwood (Populus deltoides ssp. monilifera) trees along the Little Missouri River in western North Dakota. The trees are in randomly selected flood-plain locations within the North and South units of Theodore Roosevelt National Park. The two sites are separated by 160 river km. The Little Missouri watershed contains foothills but no mountains, and most annual high flows result from snowmelt in March or April. Cores were collected and processed using standard dendrochronological methods. The effect of tree age was removed from the chronology using a single relation for the site as a whole (age-curve standardization), which preserves century-scale variation.\nTrees were as old as 371 years. Given that cottonwood establishment depends upon channel migration, abundant establishment from 1864-1891 at both sites suggests that one or more large floods occurred prior to this period. At the North Unit, establishment continued at a lower rate during the next century, but upstream at the South Unit, tree establishment was greatly curtailed after the 1800s. Comparison of General Land Office Maps from 1907 to recent satellite imagery confirms that channel migration in the last century was much greater within the North Unit, a difference caused in part by a downstream increase in flood amplification by ice jamming. Ring widths show that even on the flood plain riparian trees were chronically drought stressed. At both sites growth was strongly positively correlated with flow and precipitation and weakly negatively correlated with temperature. Growth was most strongly correlated with flow and precipitation in April-July, which is consistent with dendrometer-band measurements showing growth cessation in August. Whereas cottonwood establishment decreased in the 1900s, ring widths indicated that annual growth increased, suggesting that a decrease in snowmelt peaks was contemporaneous with an increase in early summer precipitation. We are now using rings of riparian cottonwood to reconstruct past flows at several sites in the Upper Missouri Basin, including the Little Missouri, Yellowstone and Powder rivers.",

However, the contribution of specific recharge sources to stream water is not well understood in claypan-dominated watersheds. The purpose of this study was to estimate the recharge sources to Goodwater Creek Experimental Watershed (GCEW) in north-central Missouri and investigate their importance to contaminant transport. Samples were collected from 2011 to 2014 from streams, piezometers, seep flows, and groundwater in GCEW and analyzed for major ions (including nitrate and nitrite), trace elements, stable H and O isotopes, total nitrogen (TN) and herbicides. Using an endmember mixing analysis based on conservative tracers, recharge contributions to stream flow were an average of 25% surface runoff, 44% shallow subsurface water, and 31% groundwater. TN concentrations were, on average, <0.05 ppm, 0.5 ppm, and 5 ppm in surface runoff, shallow subsurface water, and groundwater, respectively. Atrazine concentrations were, on average, <0.001 ppb, 0.052 ppb and <0.0001 in surface runoff, shallow subsurface water and groundwater, respectively. The data indicated that TN in stream water was primarily from groundwater, while shallow subsurface water was the dominant source of atrazine in stream water. An improved understanding of claypan hydrology and contaminant transport could lead to crop management practices that better protect surface water and groundwater in claypan-dominated watersheds.",

            "abstract": "Physical and chemical associations with mineral surfaces may protect organic matter (OM) from oxidative degradation and allow its preservation in soils and sediments. This study evaluates the mechanism of mineral-based preservation (MBP) and the time scale on which MBP is operative by tracking the co-evolution of oxide minerals and associated OM during mineral precipitation and ripening. Scanning transmission X-ray microscopy coupled to near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (STXM-NEXAFS) as well as bulk NEXAFS demonstrate that, in laboratory systems using cell-free filtrate from pure bacterial cultures, an association between OM and biogenic manganese oxides is rapidly established. OM associated with freshly precipitated biominerals consists of proteinaceous carbon and nitrogen consistent with a microbial origin; this composition remains constant over the course of 96 hours, despite mineral aggregation and structural evolution from hexagonal to triclinic birnessite. We predict that, in natural systems, oxide minerals simultaneously drive remineralization and offer MBP. Different minerals will promote a different balance between the two, imparting a mineral-specific signature on the concentration and composition of preserved OM. We test this idea by conducting incubations of natural estuary waters spiked with compositionally and structurally diverse synthetic oxide minerals. The concentration and composition of mineral-associated OM were tracked by element analyzer-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (EA-IRMS) and STXM-NEXAFS in multiple experiments lasting between 4 weeks and 1 year. Results from incubation experiments are contrasted with natural sediment samples from a range of depositional environments in order to evaluate the potential for long-term sequestration of organic carbon in sediments facilitated by minerals.",

Other features may include the formation of a new microplates, rearrangement and aggregation of crustal fragments into new islands, and rotations of the microplates. Numerous issues regarding the nature and timing of formation of the features described above, their roles in regional tectonics and even whether they exist at all, remain unresolved. Our short-term goal is to better constraint lithospheric structure and identify active earthquake faults with a temporary broadband seismic network in the Dominican Republic. The oblique-subduction-to-strike-slip transition found in the NCPBZ is representative of numerous locales around the world, so lessons learned here may inform our understanding of plate tectonics broadly.\nIn 2013-2014 we installed sixteen broadband seismic stations in the Dominican Republic. The temporary network will remain in place for two years. Data acquired by the temporary network will be integrated with data recorded by existing seismic facilities in the region and the combined dataset will be used for a series of analyses that will, collectively, allow us to image lithospheric structure and aid seismic hazard assessment for the island of Hispaniola. Preliminary results will be presented from the deployment, including regional earthquake locations and improved 1D Earth structure as well as plans for collaborations between regional seismic networks and local capacity-building.",

More importantly, the wide range of experience helped me identify what worked for me. My favorite way to share my science now? Twitter.\nTo many, Twitter is a frivolous platform for sharing snippets 140 characters or less. To me, however, it is how I can connect directly with the elusive “wider public” and share my science.\nSpecifically, I use satellite imagery (mostly Landsat 8) to study glaciers around the world. I look at long-term change related to climate, and I also investigate new, innovative ways to use satellite imagery to better understand glaciers and ice sheets. Luckily for me, my research is very visual. Whether fieldwork snapshots or satellite data, images make for great, shareable, accessible tweets.\nIn this presentation, I propose to share my experience of tweeting as an early career researcher. I will include successful strategies (e.g. particular #hashtags, creating new content, using story-telling, timely tweets), as well as some not-so-successful attempts. I will also talk about how I built my Twitter network. In addition to anecdotes, I will include evaluation of my Twitter activity using available metrics and analytics (e.g. followers, favorites, re-tweets, Klout score, etc.).\nWhile misunderstood by many in the scientific community, Twitter is a platform increasingly being adopted by researchers. Used correctly, it can be a great tool for connecting directly with an interested, non-technical audience eager to learn about your research. With my experiences and evaluation, I will show how both scientists and the networks that they join and create can benefit by using Twitter as a platform for science communication.",

            "abstract": "Water resources are essential to development, not only economically but also socially, politically and ecologically. With growing demand and potentially shrinking supply, water scarcity is one of the most pressing socio–ecological problems of the 21st century. Considering implications of global change and the complexity of interrelated systems, uncertain future conditions compound problems associated with water stress, requiring hydrologic models to re-examine traditional water resource planning and management.\nThe Copiapó water basin, located in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile exhibits a complex resource management scenario. With annual average precipitation of only 28 mm, water intensive sectors such as export agriculture, extensive mining, and a growing population have depleted the aquifer´s reserves to near critical levels. Being that global climate change models predict a decrease in already scarce precipitation, and that growing population and economies demand will likely increase, the real future situation might be even worse than that predicted. A viable option for alleviation of water stress, water reuse and recycling has evolved through technological innovation to feasibly meet hydraulic needs with reclaimed water. For the proper application of these methods for resource management, however, stakeholders must possess tools by which to quantify hydrologic risk, understand its factors of causation, and choose between competing management scenarios and technologies so as to optimize productivity. While previous investigations have addressed similar problems, they often overlook aspects of forecasting uncertainty, proposing solutions that while accurate under specific scenarios, lack robustness to withstand future variations. Using the WEAP (Water Evaluation and Planning) platform for hydrologic modeling, this study proposes a methodology, applicable to other stressed watersheds, to quantify inherent risk in water management positions, while considering uncertainties in supply (climate change), demand (market variations), and measurement (risk definition). Applied to the Copaipó case study, this methodology proposes the solution of a 30% demand decrease within the agricultural sector through urban wastewater recycling and increased irrigation efficiency.",

            "abstract": "In the Sahel, the temperature is extremely high in Spring, with typical monthly-mean values of daily minimum, maximum and mean temperature of respectively 30, 40 and 35°C (Guichard et al. J. Hydrology 2009). Therefore, heat waves occurring at this period of the year can have particularly severe repercussions. Furthermore, current climate projections suggest that their frequency and intensity may increase in the future. Numerous heat-wave studies have focused on the mid-latitudes, but almost none on the Sahel. However, the specificities of the Sahelian climate imply that the mechanisms at play in this semi-arid region differ from those previously identified in the mid-latitudes. The influence of the Saharan Heat low is strong in this region; the soil is mostly dry in Spring, and soil-moisture feedbacks identified in mid-latitude studies are therefore unlikely to operate during Sahelian heat waves at this time of year. The present study is carried out within the ACASIS ANR project, which focuses on these Sahelian events. Here, we make use of complementary datasets (SYNOP and soundings data, high-frequency weather and flux stations, satellite data, meteorological reanalyses), together with models, to explore the importance of physical processes during a few selected heat-wave cases chosen from 2006 to 2014. These events are first identified with commonly-used indexes and the associated large-scale circulations are documented. The time-sequences of the surface energy budget and boundary layer diurnal and nocturnal states are then presented, with estimations of non-negligible cloud and aerosol effects on surface radiative fluxes. Our results imply in particular a major importance of the monsoon flow during the night, which induces dramatic changes in the surface-atmosphere couplings, namely a sharp increase of the net longwave flux involving water vapour radiative properties, accompanied by a strong night-time warming. These processes are diversely captured by models and reanalyses.",

            "abstract": "We report on the methods and results from the GPS data analysis part of the NSF Geodesy Advancing Geosciences and EarthScope (GAGE) project operated by UNAVCO. Current analyses include GPS data from the 1100 Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) sites and approximately 700 other sites used to densify the network in some locations and to provide spatial extent on the North America and Pacific plates. Analyses from 1996 to present collectively include approximately 2050 unique sites over the 18-year period. The results from these analyses are updated daily for rapid solutions (~1 day latency) and weekly for initial analyses using IGS final orbits (2-3 week latency). Analyses are also run with 12- and 26-week latencies to add sites that were not available (either telemetry failures or manual download sites) during the initial analyses. Raw data are processed using two different GPS analysis programs: GAMIT at New Mexico Tech and GIPSY at Central Washington University. Combined results are then produced with GLOBK at MIT. All results are available through the UNAVCO web site in the form of time series and velocity fields in the NAM08 (Altamimi et al.’s, 2012, ITRF2008 North America Euler pole) and IGS08 frames. Daily SINEX files are provided in fiducial free and NAM08 frames. Event files are generated within a few days of earthquakes in the GAGE analysis region that generate co-seismic displacements greater than 1 mm. The median weighted root-mean-square (WRMS) scatters of combined position time series are less than 1 mm in north and east (NE) and 4 mm for vertical (U) over monthly durations. For all results processed thus far (~18 years of data for the longest running sites), WRMS scatters of the position residuals about linear trends, with offsets for earthquakes and antenna changes removed, are ~1.5 mm NE and 4.5 mm U. The top 10% of sites have short period scatters (month duration) of 0.5 mm NE and 1.9 mm U, while the long-term scatters increase to 0.8 mm NE and 3.3 mm U. The noisiest sites are generally in volcanic areas and/or affected by snow and ice on antennas. We will present results from GAGE analyses in terms of secular rates across the Pacific/North America plate boundary and non-secular signals arising from earthquakes (co- and post-seismic deformation) and other natural and human-induced processes.",

            "abstract": "Understanding flow along faults and fractures in shales is important for better understanding of hydraulic stimulation in unconventional reservoirs. For example, the re-activation of faults and fractures during hydraulic stimulation appears to be an important process contributing to reservoir permeability. In this study, we examine the effect of shear slip on fault permeability in shale reservoir rocks. We perform shear experiments in a triaxial apparatus on two types of samples: 1) a sample sawcut at 30° to the cylindrical axis and 2) a naturally broken sample. Both samples are from 3481 m (11422 ft) depth within the Haynesville reservoir containing 22 wt.% clay. First, we hydrostatically load the samples to a confining pressure of 15 MPa (2176 psi), followed by triaxial loading in which a constant axial displacement rate of 1 μm/s is applied for increments in axial displacement of initially 0.25 mm and later 1 mm. After each shear increment, we perform measurements of fault permeability at a constant mean pore pressure of 2.1 MPa (300 psi) using the steady state Darcy flow method. Boreholes drilled parallel to the cylindrical axis on either side of the shale sample allow pore fluid to access the fault plane. The coefficient of friction increases with shearing from 0.53 to 0.61 for the sawcut sample and from about 0.60 to 0.74 for the naturally broken sample. The sawcut sample indicates stable sliding behavior whereas small stick-slip events occur in the naturally broken sample. Upon shearing, fault permeability decreases by about 2.5 and 1.5 orders of magnitude within the first mm of shear displacement for the sawcut and naturally broken sample, respectively. Fault permeability of both samples continues to slowly decrease up to a maximum axial displacement of 4 mm and 2 mm, respectively. Laser scanning images before and after shearing show the formation of small striations in the direction of slip for the sawcut sample and the break-off of several grain fragments and formation of gouge for the naturally broken sample. New flow pathways appear to develop during shearing of the naturally broken shale sample due to grains being plucked off of the sliding surfaces and crushed, resulting in a smaller fault permeability reduction than for the sawcut sample with smoother fault surfaces.",

            "abstract": "Thermal output from the magma chamber underlying Yellowstone National Park (YNP) can be estimated by monitoring Cl flux in major rivers draining the park. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Park Service have collaborated on Cl flux monitoring towards this end since the 1970s. Researchers collected water samples from the major rivers in YNP, but funding restrictions, winter travel, and the great distances between sites limits the number of samples collected annually. The use of electrical conductivity, which is relatively easy to measure and can be automated, as a proxy for Cl enables a more consistent monitoring of thermal output. To accomplish this, it is crucial to accurately quantify the relationship between electrical conductivity, Cl, and other geothermal solutes (SO4, F, HCO3, SiO2, K, Li, B, and As) along the Madison, Firehole, Gibbon, Snake, Gardner, and Yellowstone Rivers. Conductivity measurements were made every 15 minutes adjacent to USGS stream gages, allowing for the determination of solute fluxes. In addition, continuous conductivity measurements can be used to identify changes in river chemistry as a result of geysers eruptions, rain events, or changes in thermal inputs as a result of earthquakes or other natural events. Depending on the site, we have collected 2 to 5 years of conductivity measurements. Except for some trace elements (Fe and Hg), most solutes behave conservatively, and the ratio of geothermal solute concentrations are constant. Hence, dissolved concentrations of Cl, SO4, F, HCO3, SiO2, K, Li, Ca, B, and As correlate well with conductivity (R2 > 0.96). The use of conductivity to estimate solute concentrations and fluxes will provide a greater understanding of the systematics of the Yellowstone thermal output and allow for monitoring of many more solutes at a much higher temporal frequency.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost soils have received tremendous interest due to their importance as a global carbon store with the potential to be thawed over the coming centuries. Instead of being ‘frozen in time,’ permafrost contains active microbes. Most metagenomic studies have focused on Holocene aged permafrost. Here, we target Pleistocene aged ice and carbon rich permafrost (Yedoma), which can differ in carbon content and stage of decay. Our aim was to understand how microbes in the permafrost transform organic matter over geologic time and to identify physiological and biochemical adaptations that enable long-term survival. We used next-generation sequencing to characterize microbial communities along a permafrost age gradient. Samples were collected from the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) Permafrost Tunnel near Fox, AK, which penetrates a hillside providing access to permafrost ranging in age from 12 to 40 kyr. DNA was extracted directly from unthawed samples. 16S rRNA amplicon (16S) and shotgun metagenome sequencing revealed significant age-driven differences. First, microbial diversity declines with permafrost age, likely due to long-term exposure to environmental stresses and a reduction in metabolic resources. Second, we observed taxonomic differences among ages, with an increasing abundance of Firmicutes (endospore-formers) in older samples, suggesting that dormancy is a common survival strategy in older permafrost. Ordination of 16S and metagenome data revealed age-based clustering. Genes differing significantly between age categories included those involved in lipopolysaccharide assembly, cold-response, and carbon processing. These data point to the physiological adaptations to long-term frozen conditions and to the metabolic processes utilized in ancient permafrost. In fact, a gene common in older samples is involved in cadaverine production, which could potentially explain the putrefied smell of Pleistocene aged permafrost. Coupled with soil chemistry analysis, these processes show how a tightly linked microbial food web can survive over geologic time with no influx of new energy or materials. This web may also help to explain differences in Pleistocene carbon chemistry and why this carbon is highly bioavailable for microbial consumption post thaw.",

            "abstract": "Multiple methods of broadband seismometer emplacement are used on portable experiments. Techniques range from a typical IRIS PASSCAL vault (~1-m deep vault with a decoupled pier), to an EarthScope USArray Flexible Array (FA) vault (~1-m deep narrow vault with a cement plug in the bottom coupled to the vault), both using traditional vault (pier) sensors, as well as direct burial emplacement of both sensors purpose-built for direct burial and standard vault sensors. The selection of the appropriate sensor emplacement technique for a given environment has often relied on anecdotal assessment or personal preference. We have performed an inter-comparison of these various emplacement techniques, for diverse environments. Our goal is to provide quantitative information that will facilitate choosing deployment strategies that best meet an experiment’s scientific goals and logistical constraints.\nFor our analysis, a total of 15 networks (781 stations) from PASSCAL and FA are analyzed using SQLX, which utilizes the ambient noise analysis methods of McNamara and Buland*. Using this analysis, a comparison of the mean of the monthly mode (MMM) of each component of the networks is performed to evaluate the various emplacement methods currently used. We have used a total of 182 PASSCAL stations (5 networks using PASSCAL vaults and 1 network using direct burial installs) and 365 FA stations (5 networks with FA vaults, 2 networks using direct burial installs, and 2 networks with a mix of installation types). The installations span a variety of environments. For our analysis the MMM has been calculated for each component separately (Z, N and E) and these results are compared to similar results already computed for EarthScope USArray Transportable Array (TA) stations. To evaluate the relative network performance, we use three separate period bands: short period (< 1 s), microseism band (1-10 s) and long period (10 -100 s). Using the TA baseline as a reference, each network is ranked from quietest to noisiest. Results of this comparison will be presented.\n* (McNamara, D.E. and R.P.

New high resolution 3D models of the crust and uppermost mantle have been constructed recently across the US by inverting surface wave dispersion from ambient noise and earthquakes, receiver functions, and Rayleigh wave H/V ratios using USArray data [e.g., Shen et al., 2013]. These are mostly S-wave models of the lithosphere, however, which are not optimal for predicting regional P-wave travel times. We explore the use of observations of surface waves to improve regional event characterization because the new 3D models are constructed explicitly to model their behavior. In particular, we use measurements of group and phase time delays and the amplitude ratio between different periods of surface waves to estimate the moment tensor, the epicentral location and the earthquake depth. Preliminary estimates of these variables are determined through a simulated annealing algorithm. Afterward, a Bayesian Monte Carlo method is applied to estimate the posterior distribution of all variables in order to assess uncertainties in source characteristics. The reliability and limitations of the location method are tested by systematic relocation of earthquakes across the contiguous US.",

All data collected by these observatories are archived and publicly available through ONC's Oceans 2.0 data portal. Much of the data are related to marine geohazards, such as earthquakes, submarine landslides, and tsunamis and are delivered in real-time to various agencies, including early warning centers.\nThe NEPTUNE and VENUS cabled observatories consist of over 850 km of cable deployed inshore and offshore off Vancouver Island and covers the coastal zones, the northern part of the Cascadia subduction zone, Cascadia Basin, and the Endeavour Segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge. Geological evidence suggests that there is a 25–40% probability of a magnitude 8 or greater megathrust earthquake along the Cascadia subduction zone in the next 50 years and that the most recent great earthquake (estimated magnitude ~9.0) that occurred in 1700 caused widespread tsunami damage. However, most of the tsunamis that arrive in the area originate from distant sources around the Pacific. Over the last 100 years, numerous major tsunamis have occurred in the Pacific Ocean, killing many tens of thousands of people.\nThe NEPTUNE observatory includes high-precision bottom pressure recorders (BPRs) at each major nodes and a tsunami meter consisting of three BPRs arranged on a ~20 km radius circle around the flat Cascadia Basin site. On September 30, 2009, just days after the first NEPTUNE instruments were installed, the first tsunami waves of 2.5-6.0 cm amplitude generated by the Mw 8.1 Samoa earthquake were recorded by six BPRs. The Samoan tsunami was followed by several other events recorded by the network, including the 2010 Chilean tsunami, the 2011 Tōhoku-Oki earthquake and tsunami, and the 2012 Haida Gwaii tsunami. These open-ocean observations were uncontaminated by coastal effects, demonstrating that NEPTUNE records from future tsunami events can be effectively used as real-time input to regional numerical tsunami forecast models. In fact, real-time data from NEPTUNE seismometers and BPRs already feed into the NOAA operated tsunami early warning systems.",

The extended 2007-2013 period of MARCI daily global image maps reveals the widespread distribution of these high altitude clouds, which are somewhat paradoxically associated with specific surface regions. They appear as longitudinally extended (300-700 km) cloud trails with distinct leading plumes of substantial ice cloud optical depths (0.02-0.2) for such high altitudes of occurrence (40-50 km, from cloud surface shadow measurements). These plumes generate small ice particles (Reff~1 to <0.2 microns) that become entrained in the strong westward mesospheric zonal wind regime of the perihelion (southern summer ) season, although the specific dynamics and cloud microphysics for these plumes are not determined. They are clearly tied to maximum surface heating on Mars, in terms of season (perihelion), local time (early afternoon), and surface latitude/albedo/elevation. The most persistent expressions of these clouds are found in association with two Valles Marineris locations (Clancy et al., 2009). However, a broader survey of MARCI observations reveals many specific regions of occurrence over Ls=200-300. Furthermore, MRO CRISM limb observations indicate a haze of such fine water ice particles characterizes the full southern hemisphere mesosphere at this time. Hence, the behavior of perihelion cloud trails appears to reflect locally elevated mesospheric water ice formation that may impact the global expression of mesospheric water ice aerosols.",

            "abstract": "The NASA/DLR GRACE mission has delivered over a dozen years of time-variable gravitational information that has seen widespread use in the study of processes in hydrology, oceanography, the cryosphere, and is particularly critical to inform, improve, and validate computational models of the Earth system. Assimilation of GRACE products into land surface models has been investigated using the monthly smoothed and destriped gridded-mass (Level-3) datasets. However, the coarse spatial and temporal resolution of these fields limits their use for data assimilation. This study offers advances in (1) improving the signal content retained from the GRACE satellite observations via the use of sliding window solutions and (2) improvements of the error characterization and data assimilation procedure of GRACE TWS information into the Community Land Model (CLM).\nPresently, approximately thirty equally weighted days of data are used to estimate each gravity field. However, through differential weighting of the daily GRACE files used in each solution it is possible to optimize the desired signal characteristics while fulfilling the observability requirements. This differential weighting scheme creates a pseudo-daily “sliding window” product and increases the frequency retention by boosting the low frequency gain and providing gravity field solutions on shorter time scales. The effectiveness of the modified solutions is assessed through assimilation of both the sliding window and traditional monthly solutions into CLM using the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). The error characterization of the GRACE observations is expanded within the DA framework to show and accurately reflect the spatial and temporal error patterns present in the data. Furthermore, the transformation between model and observation space and the disaggregation of the update calculated by the Ensemble Kalman Filter to the finer resolution CLM state variable space bears further examination. The addition of improved frequency retention, error characterization and model state-observation transformation algorithmics offers increased effectiveness and new methods of data extraction from time-variable gravity datasets from the GRACE and future geodetic observing missions.",

            "abstract": "Cloud-based applications or apps are a promising medium through which water resources models and data can be conveyed in a user-friendly environment—making them more accessible to decision-makers and stakeholders. In the context of this work, a water resources web app is a web application that exposes limited modeling functionality for a scenario exploration activity in a structured workflow (e.g.: land use change runoff analysis, snowmelt runoff prediction, and flood potential analysis).\nThe technical expertise required to develop water resources web apps can be a barrier to many potential developers of water resources apps. One challenge that developers face is in providing spatial storage, analysis, and visualization for the spatial data that is inherent to water resources models. The software projects that provide this functionality are non-standard to web development and there are a large number of free and open source software (FOSS) projects to choose from. In addition, it is often required to synthesize several software projects to provide all of the needed functionality. Another challenge for the developer will be orchestrating the use of several software components. Consequently, the initial software development investment required to deploy an effective water resources cloud-based application can be substantial.\nThe Tethys Platform has been developed to lower the technical barrier and minimize the initial development investment that prohibits many scientists and engineers from making use of the web app medium. Tethys synthesizes several software projects including PostGIS for spatial storage, 52°North WPS for spatial analysis, GeoServer for spatial publishing, Google Earth™, Google Maps™ and OpenLayers for spatial visualization, and Highcharts for plotting tabular data. The software selection came after a literature review of software projects being used to create existing earth sciences web apps. All of the software is linked via a Python-powered software development kit (SDK). Tethys developers use the SDK to build their apps and incorporate the needed functionality from the software suite. The presentation will include several apps that have been developed using Tethys to demonstrate its capabilities.\nBased upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1135483.",

            "abstract": "A precise, time-efficient, cost-effective method for quantifying riverbed roughness and sediment size distribution has hitherto eluded river scientists. Traditional techniques (e.g., Wolman counts) have high potential for error brought about by operator bias and subjectivity when presented with complex facies assemblages, poor spatial coverage, insufficient sample sizes, and misrepresentation of bedforms. The application of LiDAR facilitated accurate observation of micro-scale habitats, and has been successfully employed in quantifying sediment grain size at the local level. However, despite considerable success of LiDAR instruments in remotely sensing riverine landscapes, and the obvious benefits they offer – very high spatial and temporal resolution, rapid data acquisition, and minimal disturbance in the field – procurement of these apparatus and their respective computer software comes at high financial cost, and extensive user training is generally necessary in order to operate such devices. Recent developments in computer software have led to advancements in digital photogrammetry over a broad range of scales, with Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques enabling production of precise DEMs based on point-clouds analogous to, and even denser than, those produced by LiDAR, at significantly reduced cost and complexity during post-processing. This study has employed both an SfM-photogrammetry and Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) approach in a comparative analysis of sediment grain size, where LiDAR-derived data has previously provided a reliable reference of grain size. Total Station EDM theodolite provided the parent coordinate system for both SfM and meshing of TLS point-clouds. For each data set, a 0.19 m moving window (consistent with the largest sediment clast b axis) was applied to the resulting point-clouds. Two times standard deviation of elevation was calculated in order to provide a surrogate measure of grain protrusion, from which sediment frequency distribution curves were drawn. Results through semi-variance analyses elucidated continuity of each data set. Where univariate statistics failed to reveal disparity between the two data sets, semi-variance analysis exposed considerable variability in roughness, thus revealing a greater degree of detail in SfM-derived data.",

Deciding how much should be included and just how it should be introduced in any single classroom subject area can be an obstacle for a teacher.\nThe Sea Level Rise Polar Explorer App developed through the PoLAR CCEP grant offers a guided tour through the many layers of science that impact sea level rise. This map-based data-rich app is framed around a series of questions that move the user through map layers with just the level of complexity they chose to explore. For a quick look teachers and students can review a 3 or 4 sentence introduction on how the given map links to sea level and then launch straight into the interactive touchable map. For a little more in depth look they can listen to (or read) a one-minute recorded background on the data displayed in the map prior to launching in. For those who want more in depth understanding they can click to a one page background piece on the topic with links to further visualizations, videos and data. Regardless of the level of complexity selected each map is composed of clickable data allowing the user to fully explore the science. The different options for diving in allow teachers to differentiate the learning for either the subject being taught or the user level of the student group.\nThe map layers also include a range of complexities. Basic questions like “What is sea level?” talk about shorelines, past sea levels and elevations beneath the sea. Questions like “Why does sea level change?” includes slightly more complex issues like the role of ocean temperature, and how that differs from ocean heat content. And what is the role of the warming atmosphere in sea level change? Questions about “What about sea level in the past?” can bring challenges for students who have difficulty with time scales, but sections on “Who is Vulnerable?” are very tangible to the students as they look at maps of population density, ocean island populations in danger of submersion, and what regions are most vulnerable to flooding. Teachers and students alike can explore a wealth of authentic science data in an engaging and accessible way.",

Microorganisms form the base of the food chain at cold seeps, and high rates of anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) are characteristic of these methane-rich environments. While sulfate is often the electron acceptor for AOM in cold seep environments, recent evidence suggests that AOM can also be coupled to nitrate reduction. Little is known about nitrogen cycling in these habitats, though recent work indicates that denitrification is an important process in oily and gassy seep sediments. The co-occurrence of nitrate reduction and AOM suggests a potential coupling between the two processes in our study area. We used stable isotope (15N) tracer techniques to measure the capacity of Northern Gulf of Mexico cold seep sediments to reduce nitrate by denitrification and anammox. These measurements were made in surface and sub-surface sediments in conjunction with measurements of AOM, and with quantification of various geochemical and molecular characteristics. Here, we present our measurements of denitrification and anammox capacity in the context of environmental characteristics. Additionally, we examine spatial trends in the co-occurrence of AOM and nitrate reduction in these sediments.",

            "abstract": "Imaging a high-resolution spatio-temporal slip distribution of an earthquake rupture is a core research goal in seismology. In general we expect to obtain a higher quality source image by improving the observational input data (e.g. using more higher quality near-source stations). However, recent studies show that increasing the surface station density alone does not significantly improve source inversion results (Custodio et al. 2005; Zhang et al. 2014). We introduce correlation structures between the kinematic source parameters: slip, rupture velocity, and peak slip velocity (Song et al. 2009; Song and Dalguer 2013) in the non-linear source inversion. The correlation structures are physical constraints derived from rupture dynamics that effectively regularize the model space and may improve source imaging. We name this approach pseudo-dynamic source inversion. We investigate the effectiveness of this pseudo-dynamic source inversion method by inverting low frequency velocity waveforms from a synthetic dynamic rupture model of a buried vertical strike-slip event (Mw 6.5) in a homogeneous half space. In the inversion, we use a genetic algorithm in a Bayesian framework (Moneli et al. 2008), and a dynamically consistent regularized Yoffe function (Tinti, et al. 2005) was used for a single-window slip velocity function. We search for local rupture velocity directly in the inversion, and calculate the rupture time using a ray-tracing technique. We implement both auto- and cross-correlation of slip, rupture velocity, and peak slip velocity in the prior distribution.\nOur results suggest that kinematic source model estimates capture the major features of the target dynamic model. The estimated rupture velocity closely matches the target distribution from the dynamic rupture model, and the derived rupture time is smoother than the one we searched directly. By implementing both auto- and cross-correlation of kinematic source parameters, in comparison to traditional smoothing constraints, we are in effect regularizing the model space in a more physics-based manner without loosing resolution of the source image. Further investigation is needed to tune the related parameters of pseudo-dynamic source inversion and relative weighting between the prior and the likelihood function in the Bayesian inversion.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the manner in which material is exchanged between the planetary boundary layer and the free troposphere is essential for evaluating many aspects of climate, including the distribution of trace gases, the transport of energy and water, cloud types, climate sensitivity, and the surface energy balance. However, neither observations nor parameterized numerical models constrain the interplay between moist processes and joint exchanges of water and heat adequately. Advance in understanding is limited in part by the complex controls on turbulence and, in the case of cloudy boundary layers, the interplay between turbulent mixing and latent heating, which is difficult to observe. Recent theoretical and observational advances now allow stable isotope ratios of water vapor and cloud condensate to be used to isolate the transport component from other thermodynamic controls, including condensation. Here we expose the role of latent heat exchanges that would be difficult to determine without a method to track water vapor transport. Analysis of case of a very stable boundary layer shows sustained downward latent heat fluxes during the development of a radiative inversion, and which establishes a new basis for parameterizing turbulence under stable conditions. The case of a capped convective marine boundary layer highlights the role of transport processes and condensation, which are critical for maintaining the temperature and humidity structure of the lower atmosphere over tropical oceans. While a variety of trace gases can be used to identify air mass exchange, water stable isotope ratios are particularly useful because they can identify latent heat exchanges, which are necessary to fully account for the coupling of water and energy in the boundary layer. The use of isotopic tracers explicitly captures this coupling even in the case of weak turbulence when important terms needed to resolve the local energy balance would otherwise be lost.",

            "abstract": "Land disturbance is known to contribute to carbon dioxide emission through accelerated decomposition of soil organic matter. Many soils also contain large stocks of potentially reactive inorganic C (Ci) in the form of carbonate minerals. Under strong acidification conditions, as can be generated by nitrification and other biogeochemical reactions, carbonate weathering has the potential to generate CO2 emissions on a short time scale; yet little is known about the contribution of this process to disturbance-related C emissions. Information is particularly scarce for high-latitude alkaline soils.\nThe objective of this study is to determine the contribution of Ci to total greenhouse gas emissions from soil following a land disturbance event. The perturbation consisted of the conversion of long-idled agricultural land to a woody bioenergy plantation. We hypothesized that this land use change would intensify acidification processes and increase the release of Ci. We tested this hypothesis by monitoring greenhouse gas emissions during the establishment of a poplar plantation on soils developed from limestone-derived glacial drift in northern Michigan, USA. We used 13C natural abundance to estimate the contribution of Ci to soil C emissions.\nWe found that carbonates were abundant in the soil profile despite the leaching associated with the humid climate. Carbonate-C concentration averaged 2 g/kg in the topsoil and 15 to 25 g/kg in the deep subsoil. The persistence of measurable carbonate concentrations above the expected weathering front was likely due to biological translocation processes. Using a Bayesian isotopic mixing model accounting for endmember uncertainties, we detected a significant contribution of Ci to total soil CO2 emissions at the plot scale. There was a significant interaction between disturbance and season. In the spring, Ci emissions were three times higher in newly established poplar plots than in control plots. In the summer, Ci emissions in control plots rose to levels similar to disturbed plots. The disturbance also affected the partition of Ci between the gas (CO2) and dissolved (bicarbonate) phase. Altogether, these results indicate that the soil carbonate pool is substantial and reactive, and makes a measurable contribution to disturbance-induced CO2 emissions.",

            "abstract": "Substantial spatial heterogeneity of methane flux has been recognized as a key uncertainty for estimating land-atmosphere exchange and further predicting the behavior of the climate system. Static-chamber method has been widely used to measure methane flux at plot-scale of tens of centimeter while it is unable for the scale beyond, and the eddy covariance technique has been used for in-situ measuring methane flux at a scale of tens of meters while it lacks of mechanistic representation of biogeochemical processes at smaller scale. How to link methane flux at these two scales while keeping primary spatial variations is critically important for accurate quantification of methane flux. A data-model integration approach is a valuable tool to scale-up methane flux while sustaining spatial heterogeneity.\nIn this study, we take advantage of a set of in-situ measurements of methane flux at plot-scale and a flux tower domain scale, and a high-resolution dataset of vegetation distribution and meteorology data, as well as a newly-developed microbial functional group-based methane module (incorporated in CLM4.5). A footprint model is used to characterize the domain of the eddy covariance tower in which high-resolution model simulations are carried out. The ecosystem model is first parameterized with plot-scale measurements of methane flux and ecosystem properties before it is used for regional simulations across the flux tower domain. The simulated regional methane flux will be weighted by spatial contribution of land surface methane flux estimated by the footprint model, and then compared with eddy covariance measurement. The low and high boundaries of the methane flux in the domain will be estimated for its potential uncertainties during this upscaling processes by comparing with empirical modeling method. The upscaling approach with data-model integration adopted in this study is valuable as it considers spatial heterogeneity of ecosystem properties and the dynamic representativeness of tower over the season and across the spatial domain.",

            "abstract": "The Bartlett Springs Fault is a major right-lateral component of the San Andreas fault system in northern California. Fault slip-rate models inferred from GPS data [Murray et al., 2013] and alignment array data [McFarland et al., 2009] both indicate that the Bartlett Springs fault experiences aseismic creep. We use the three-dimensional finite element computer code of Barall [2009] to conduct models of dynamic spontaneous rupture on this fault, both to determine characteristics of potential earthquakes, and to gauge the ability of rupture to propagate in the creeping regions. Within the framework of slip-weakening friction, we represent locked portions of the fault as regions of positive stress drop, and creeping regions as having zero or negative stress drop. Using the fault geometry and creep distribution from studies by Murray et al., we examine simulations that implement either homogeneous initial stresses or a regional stress field, along with several different parameterizations of the contrast in frictional properties between locked and creeping zones. We compare the earthquake source characteristics for the same fault geometry with and without the known creeping sections. These comparisons can be used to estimate the impacts of the creeping sections on ground motion predictions.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have suggested that chemical compositions of olivine phenocrysts can be used to distinguish between olivine-rich and olivine-poor lithologies (peridotite and pyroxenite) in the mantle sources of MORB and OIB (Sobolev et al, 2005, 2007, Herzberg, 2011). Olivine phenocrysts are also used for 3He/4He analyses, allowing us to address linkages between basalt source lithologies and primordial helium storage in the mantle. We report 3He/4He analyses of olivine phenocrysts from Iceland and Hawaii that were previously analyzed for major and minor elements (Sobolev et al., 2007, 2008). 3He/4He in Iceland samples vary between 7-26 (R/RA) and correlate negatively with Mn/Fe and positively with Ni/Mg of the olivine phenocrysts, as well as 187Os/188Os and Gd/Lu in host lavas. These relationships suggest mixing between a degassed and incompatible element depleted peridotitic source (MORB-type?), and a primordial 3He enriched plume source containing lithologies with lower modal olivine/garnet (pyroxenite?). Hawaiian samples, on the other hand, form a positive trend in 3He/4He vs Mn/Fe space, as compared to the negative trend of the Iceland samples. Thus, the Iceland and Hawaiian plumes give contrasting results for the high 3He/4He host lithology – more pyroxenite-rich for Iceland and peridotite-rich for Hawaii. Plotting the Iceland and Hawaiian plume data together for 3He/4He vs Mn/Fe, the two divergent trends intersect at the composition of Loihi, characterized by intermediate pyroxenite/peridotite and 3He/4He of 9–28 RA. Baffin Island and West Greenland picrites have the highest known magmatic 3He/4He and high olivine Mn/Fe (Starkey et al., 2009, 2012), indicating high 3He/4He peridotites as well as pyroxenites in the Iceland plume. When plotted with the Iceland-Hawaii samples, they lie on an extension of the Hawaiian trend. This raises the possibility (pending more data from other plumes) that there is a global trend showing high 3He/4He residing in peridotite.",

Begun as a research project in January 2000, it became quasi-operational in September 2008, and operational at NCEP in August 2014. The NLDAS development included Phase 1 to establish the NLDAS configuration, including collection of soil and vegetation data, selection of land-surface models (LSMs), generation of surface forcing data sets, and model runs for a 3-year period, with evaluation/validation of model output. Phase 2 involved 30-year (1979-2008) retrospective and near real-time runs (2009-present) of four improved LSMs and surface forcing to generate energy and water fluxes, and state variables from those LSMs. The anomalies and percentiles from the 30-year climatologies for evapotranspiration, soil moisture, runoff/streamflow, and snow water equivalent have been comprehensively evaluated against observations, and are used to support US operational drought monitoring and prediction tasks such as the U.S. Drought Monitor, NCEP Climate Prediction Center drought information, and activities of the National Integrated Drought Information System. More than 34 years of surface forcing and model output data have been distributed by the NCEP/EMC NLDAS website (www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/mmb/nldas), the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data Information Services Center (GES DISC, daac.gsfc.nasa.gov), the UCAR/NCAR Climate Data Guide (climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data), and the USGS Geo Portal (cida.usgs.gov/gdp). The operational implementation provides more reliable and timely access to NLDAS products. This presentation summarizes experiences of NLDAS, status and format of current NLDAS products, and the future plans for NLDAS.",

            "abstract": "Calibration of physically-based distributed hydrologic models has always been a challenging task and subject of controversy in the literature. This study is aimed to investigate how different physiographic characteristics of watersheds call for adaption of the methods used in order to have more robust and internally justifiable simulations. Haw Watershed (1300 sq. mi.) is located in the piedmont region of North Carolina draining into B. Everett Jordan Lake located in west of Raleigh. Major land covers in this watershed are forest (50%), urban/suburban (21%) and agriculture (25%) of which a large portion is pasture. Different hydrologic behaviors are observed in this watershed based on the land use composition and size of the sub-watersheds. Highly urbanized sub-watersheds show flashier hydrographs and near instantaneous hydrologic responses. This is also the case with smaller sub-watersheds with relatively lower percentage of urban areas. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) has been widely used in the literature for hydrologic simulation on daily basis using Soil Conservation Service Curve Number method (SCS CN). However, it has not been used as frequently using the sub-daily routines. In this regard there are a number of studies in the literature which have used coarse time scale (daily) precipitation with methods like SCS CN to calibrate SWAT for watersheds containing different types of land uses and soils reporting satisfying results at the outlet of the watershed. This is while for physically-based distributed models, the more important concern should be to check and analyze the internal processes leading to those results. In this study, the watershed is divided into several sub-watersheds to compare the performance of SCS CN and Green & Ampt (GA) methods on different land uses at different spatial scales. The results suggest better performance of GA compared to SCS CN for smaller and highly urbanized sub-watersheds although GA predominance is not very significant for the latter. Also, the better performance of GA in simulating the peak flows and flashy behavior of the hydrographs is notable. GA did not show a significant improvement over SCS CN in simulating the excess rainfall for larger sub-watersheds.",

The purpose of this study is to produce erosion susceptibility maps for an area that is polluted with mining tailings which are susceptible to erosion and can disperse the particles that contain heavy metals and other toxic elements. USLE method is based in the estimation of soil loss per unit area and takes into account specific parameters such as precipitation data, topography, soil erodibility, erosivity and runoff. The R-factor (rainfall erosivity) was calculated from monthly and annual precipitation data. The K-factor (soil erodibility) was estimated using soil maps available from the CONABIO at a scale of 1:250000. The LS-factor (slope length and steepness) was determined from a 30-m digital elevation model. A raster-based Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to interactively calculate soil loss and map erosion hazard. The results show that estimated erosion rates ranged from 0 to 4770.48 t/ha year. Maximum proportion of the total area of the Zacatecas mining district have nil to very extremely slight erosion severity. Small areas in the central and south part of the study area shows the critical condition requiring sustainable land management.",

            "abstract": "Thanks to significant advances in technology and modeling capabilities, the use of geophysical monitoring techniques in support of hydrological modeling showed a rapid growth over the last decades. However, at the catchment scale, the payoff in terms of model reliability has not always justified the increased experimental efforts needed in order to collect useful additional information. The objective of this work is to evaluate the advantage gained by coupling traditional hydrological data with unconventional geophysical information in inverse modeling of a complex hydrological system. In particular, we explored how the use of time-lapsed, spatially distributed micro-gravity measurements may improve the conceptual modeling of a complex catchment, allowing for an unambiguous identification of the more appropriate model and a general reduction of uncertainty.\nThe study area is the Vermigliana catchment, a small alpine watershed located in the South-Eastern Alps, Italy. The morphology is relatively complex, being characterized by several minor valleys and ridges with elevation ranging from 950 m a.s.l. to 3558 m a.s.l. The catchment has been monitored by 13 micro-gravity stations (part of a network covering a larger area), where extensive micro-gravity measurements have been performed during 6 field campaign between 2009 and 2011. Sub-daily streamflow data are available at the Vermiglio stream gauging station (with a contributing area of 79 km2) for the same period. Once corrected to remove the effect of ocean tides and instrumental drift, micro-gravity measurements have been used as proxy of changes in the total water storage, including soil moisture, groundwater and snowpack. These data have been combined with streamflow measurements in a multi-objective optimization approach, coupling a semi-distributed hydrological model (GEOTRANSF) with a gravity model. The inclusion of microgravity data resulted in a better constraint of the inversion procedure and an improved capability to identify limitations of concurring conceptual models to a level that would be impossible relying only on streamflow data. This permitted a more reliable description of hydrological processes, with a significant (up to 90%) drop in the uncertainty associated to the evaluation of water storage variations within the system.",

            "abstract": "Many quality factors for digital topographic models (DTMs) from stereo imaging can be predicted geometrically. For example, pixel scale is related to instantaneous field of view and to range. DTM resolution can be no better than a few times this pixel scale. Even vertical precision is a known function of the pixel scale and convergence angle, providedthe image quality is high enough that automated image matching reaches its optimal precision (~0.2 pixel). The influence of incidence angle is harder to predict. Reduced quality is expected both at low incidence (where topographic shading disappears) and high incidence (where signal/noise ratio is low and shadows occur). This problem is of general interest, but especially critical for the Europa Clipper mission profile. Clipper would obtain a radar sounding profile on each Europa flyby. Stereo images collected simultaneously would be used to produce a DTM needed to distinguish off-nadir surface echos (clutter) from subsurface features. The question is, how much of this DTM strip will be useful, given that incidence angle will vary substantially?\n We are using simulations to answer this question. We produced a 210 m/post DTM of the Castalia Macula region of Europa from 6 Galileo images by photoclinometry. A low-incidence image was used to correct for albedo variations before photoclinometry. We are using the image simulation software OASIS to generate synthetic stereopairs of the region at a full range of incidence angles. These images will be realistic in terms of image resolution, noise, photometry including albedo variations (based on the low incidence image), and cast shadows. The pairs will then be analyzed with the commercial stereomapping software SOCET SET (® BAE Systems), which we have used for a wide variety of planetary mapping projects. Comparing the stereo-derived DTMs to the input (“truth”) DTM will allow us to quantify the dependence of true DTM resolution and vertical precision on illumination, and to document the qualitative ways that DTMs degrade at high and low incidence angles.\nThis methodology is immediately applicable to other planetary targets, and in particular can be used to address how much difference in illumination can be tolerated in stereopairs that are not (as for Clipper) acquired simultaneously.",

            "abstract": "Providing publicly accessible high-quality and long-term satellite based solar resource datasets for the US reduces barriers to solar grid penetration. There are two widely used approaches to derive solar resource from satellites (a) an empirical approach that relates ground based observations with satellite measurements and (b) a physics based approach that considers the radiation received at the satellite and create retrievals to estimate clouds and surface radiation. While empirical methods have been traditionally used for computing surface radiation the advent of faster computing has made operational physical models viable. The Global Solar Insolation Project (GSIP) is an operational physical model from NOAA that computes GHI using the visible and infrared channel measurements from the GOES satellites. GSIP uses a two-stage scheme that first retrieves cloud properties and uses those properties in the Satellite Algorithm for Surface Radiation Budget (SASRAB) model to calculate surface radiation. NREL, University of Wisconsin and NOAA have recently collaborated to adapt GSIP to create a high temporal and spatial resolution dataset. The product initially generates the cloud properties through applying the AVHRR Pathfinder Atmospheres-Extended (PATMOS-x) algorithms on GOES data while the global horizontal radiation (GHI) and diffuse horizontal radiation (DHI) are calculated using SASRAB. Comparison with ground sites resulted in the finding that the satellite based surface radiation suffered from a significant low-bias. The most significant bias occurred in clear-sky situation. To remove this clear-sky bias we tested three new radiative transfer algorithms that required aerosol optical depth and precipitable water vapor as inputs. These experiments showed significant improvement in the clear sky radiation (Figure 1). We will present an outline of the development of this new version of the NSRDB, a validation of the product and future plans for enhancement and improvement.",

            "abstract": "Studies of the impact of renewables on the electrical transmission grid are needed as power production from renewable energy resources increases. These studies require estimates of high temporal and spatial resolution power output under various scenarios. Satellite-based solar resource estimates are the best source of long-term irradiance data but are generally of lower temporal and spatial resolution than needed and thus require downscaling. Likewise, weather forecast models cannot provide high spatial or temporal irradiance predictions. Downscaling requires information about solar irradiance variability in both space and time, which is primarily a function of cloud properties.\nIn this study, we analyze the relationships between the temporal variability of surface solar irradiance and satellite-based cloud properties. One-minute resolution surface solar irradiance data were obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Surface Radiation (SURFRAD) network. These sites are distributed across the United States to cover a range of meteorological conditions. Cloud information at a nominal 4 km resolution and half hour intervals was retrieved from NOAA’s Geostationary Operation Environmental Satellites (GOES). The retrieved cloud properties were then used to select and composite irradiance data from the measurement sites in order to identify the cloud properties that exert the strongest control over short-term irradiance variability. The irradiance variability was characterized using statistics of both the irradiances themselves and of irradiance differences computed for short time scales (minutes). The relationships derived using this method will be presented, comparing and contrasting the statistics computed for the different cloud properties. The implications for downscaling irradiance from satellites or forecast models will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Physics-based ground motion simulations can calculate the propagation of earthquake waves through 3D velocity models of the Earth. The Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) has developed the Unified Community Velocity Model (UCVM) framework to help researchers build structured or unstructured velocity meshes from 3D velocity models for use in wave propagation simulations.\nThe UCVM software framework makes it easy to extract P and S wave propagation speeds and other material properties from 3D velocity models by providing a common interface through which researchers can query earth models for a given location and depth. Currently, the platform supports multiple California models, including SCEC CVM-S4 and CVM-H 11.9.1, and has been designed to support models from any region on earth. UCVM is currently being use to generate velocity meshes for many SCEC wave propagation codes, including AWP-ODC-SGT and Hercules.\nIn this presentation, we describe improvements to the UCVM software. The current version, UCVM 14.3.0, released in March of 2014, supports the newest Southern California velocity model, CVM-S4.26, which was derived from 26 full-3D tomographic iterations using CVM-S4 as the starting model (Lee et al., this meeting), and the Broadband 1D velocity model used in the CyberShake 14.2 study. We have ported UCVM to multiple Linux distributions and OS X.\nAlso included in this release is the ability to add small-scale stochastic heterogeneities to extract Cartesian meshes for use in high-frequency ground motion simulations. This tool was built using the C language open-source FFT library, FFTW. The stochastic parameters (Hurst exponent, correlation length, and the horizontal/vertical aspect ratio) can be customized by the user.\nUCVM v14.3.0 also provides visualization scripts for constructing cross-sections, horizontal slices, basin depths, and Vs30 maps. The interface allows researchers to visually review velocity models . Also, UCVM v14.3.0 can extract isosurfaces of shear-wave velocities equal to 1 km/s (Z1.0) and 2.5 km/s (Z2.5) for any of the registered velocity models. We have also improved our open source distribution by including a user’s guide, an advanced user’s guide, and a developer’s guide so that users of all levels can get started using and extending the UCVM platform.",

As part of the overall project, we present high-resolution paleomagnetic and rock magnetic results from the top ~36 meters composite depth (mcd) of Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Site U1389 (36º 25.515’N; 7º 16.683’W, 644 m water depth) located approximately 90 km west of Cádiz. The sedimentary section is represented by a thick, rapidly accumulated (mean sediment accumulation rate of ~40 cm/kyr), and very uniform series of contouritic sediment. The age model was obtained by tuning the planktonic foraminifer oxygen isotope data to the NGRIP ice core record. Paleomagnetic and rock magnetic measurements were collected at 1-cm interval resolution on U-channel samples covering the top ~36 mcd, with the goal of extracting a high-resolution record of paleosecular variation, relative geomagnetic paleointensity change, and the variability of the paleoenvironmental conditions. Detailed demagnetization of the natural remanence (NRM) reveals the successful removal of a secondary magnetization and identification of a stable and strong primary magnetization carried by the sediment samples (average MAD associated with principal component analysis: 0.97º). Isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) acquisition curves and excellent behavior of the samples during alternating field demagnetization suggest magnetite as the main magnetic remanence carrier. Relative paleointensity estimates were calculated by normalizing NRM with ARM, IRM, as well as magnetic susceptibility. Time-frequency analyses of high-resolution concentration and grain-size dependent paleomagnetic proxy data and other physical properties are in progress and will be presented with the goal of identifying the driver of cyclic changes in the sedimentary section.",

These data are also an invaluable aid in strategic path planning, and are necessary for finding traverses to scientifically interesting locations while maintaining rover safety. Here we focus on predictions for Curiosity’s traverse to Mt. Sharp using along-track oversampled (ATO) Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) datasets. The high spectral and spatial resolution of this dataset provides important information about terrain physical properties and surface composition. We find that spectral variability along the route from Bradbury Landing to Mt. Sharp is dominated by variations in the flux of dark sand versus bright dust, and hypothesize spectral differences among aeolian material are likely due to variations in dust cover on darker aeolian material. We focus our investigation of CRISM data over the small-scale aeolian features along Curiosity’s traverse, and we couple this analysis with in situ data gathered during drives to determine the degree to which the variations in compositions and physical properties of aeolian materials influence the degree of rover slip and wheel sinkage when crossing these bedforms.",

From the beginning, these lessons were developed in close working relationships between scientists and educators, and the lessons geared towards middle school have been recently piloted with the intent to maximize sustained student interest in STEM topics. While teaching these units, educators used surveys, polls, group discussions, and interviews to shed light on correlations between student interest in STEM and their close proximity to exemplary and enthusiastic educators and student leaders who are active in STEM activities such as research projects and expeditions.

            "abstract": "Recent advances in techniques to measure carbon dioxide (CO2) in urban plumes show potential for validating and monitoring emission inventories at regional to urban scale. A major challenge remains the attribution of elevated CO2 in urban plumes to different fuel and biogenic sources. Stable isotopes are a promising source of additional information.\nHere, we report a full year of measurements of CO2 mixing ratios, δ13C and δ18O in CO2 in the urban boundary layer over Vancouver, Canada. The goal of the work is to link seasonally changing isotopic composition to dominant fuel sources and put the urban enhancement into the context of regional background concentrations.\nAtmospheric composition in the urban atmosphere was measured continuously using a tunable diode laser absorption system (TGA 200, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA). In addition, end member signatures were determined by means of bag samples from representative fuel emission sources (gasoline, diesel, natural gas). While δ13C depends on the fuel type and origin (for Vancouver in 2013/14: δ13C gasoline 27.2‰; diesel -28.8‰; natural gas -41.6‰), δ18O is fractionated in catalytic converters (d18O gasoline vehicles -12.5‰; diesel -18.6‰; natural gas -22.7‰) and exhibits higher variability between samples. Additional signatures were determined for human, soil and plant respiration.\nDuring the study year, monthly mean mixing ratios in the urban atmosphere ranged between 410.5 (Jul) and 425.7 ppm (Dec), which was on average 18 ppm elevated above the regional background. As expected, mean monthly δ13C was lower in winter than summer with seasonally changing intercepts between -33.6‰ (JJF) and -27.7‰ (MJJ). Making the simple assumption that natural gas and gasoline are the only major fuel sources, natural gas would contribute ~45% to emissions in winter and ~3% in early summer, which is lower than the downscaled Local Emissions Inventory (57% in winter and 20% in summer). Mean δ18O showed a clear annual cycle with higher monthly intercepts in summer (-15.6 ‰) than in winter (-20.2 ‰). Various mixing models were explored to characterize contributions to the urban enhancement and analyzed in combination with meteorological data.",

            "abstract": "The frictional stability of grains in a channel bed exerts a key control on sediment transport rates. The metric of grain stability, the particle friction angle, is observed in laboratory measurements to decrease with increasing grain size for a given substrate. This phenomenon, along with greater protrusion into the flow, tends to push channel beds towards the condition in which all grain sizes move at similar shear stresses. Qualitative observations of grain stability in mountain channels, however, suggest that a significant portion of the channel bed remains immobile during bankfull flood events. Steps composed of coarse grains sometimes span the channel width and are more resistant to erosion. In addition, size-selective transport is more common in these channels, and coarse grains tend to remain in place as finer grains are transported. This anomalous stability may be explained by the effects of grain sorting. To test this hypothesis we measured in-situ particle friction angles at eight steep sites in California with slopes ranging from 0.9% to 42%. The results indicate that in moderately steep beds (0.9% to 6.5%) particle friction angle is not a function of relative grain size, contrary to previous studies of particle friction angles. On steeper slopes (15% to 42%), however, the typical relationship is partially recovered, and coarser grains have lower particle friction angles than finer ones. Subtle textural differences between moderately steep and very steep channel beds suggest that incipient fluvial sorting into sub-meter-scale patches may be responsible for the grain-size-independent friction angles. In the very steep channel beds, where debris flows tend to dominate transport, grains appear randomly organized with respect to size. Downstream, in moderately steep channel beds, sorting into small clusters places particles next to those of similar size. Sorting into channel-spanning steps occurred at all slopes, however, and the grains within these steps were, on average, three-times harder to move than grains outside of steps when normalized by grain weight. These results suggest that sorting, and the resultant particle friction angles, is at least partially responsible for the stability of steps and coarse grains in moderately steep channels.",

            "abstract": "To fully understand controlling factors of organic compound generation during oil shale maturation, and systematically assess associated carbon isotope values, a series of hydrous pyrolysis experiments are performed. Kerogen was isolated from Green River shale by a set of acid treatment. Experiments are conducted at 350 °C and 300 bars of total pressure with running time of 24, 48 and 72 hours, respectively. In each experiment, the reactor contains 1.5 grams of kerogen and 30 grams of deionized water. After experiments, gaseous products are removed under cryogenic conditions for chemical and carbon isotope analyses (GC-IRMS). The bitumen product is retrieved and separated into saturated hydrocarbons, aromatics, resins, and asphaltenes (SARA) by HPLC before subsequent analyses (GC, GC-MS, and IRMS).\nThe gaseous compounds from experiments consisted of CO2 and C1 to C4 hydrocarbons. Semiquantitative analysis indicates the yield of n-alkanes decreases with carbon number, with CO2 being more abundant than all alkanes. The δ13C value of alkanes increases with molecular weight, with CO2 having the highest value. Methane and ethane become enriched in 13C with time.\nIn bitumen products, gravimetric analysis has shown that the abundance of aromatics increases with time, while that of asphaltenes decreases. After 72 hours, the weight percentages of saturated hydrocarbons, aromatics, resins and asphaltenes are 2.6, 42.3, 40.1, and 15.0, respectively. High resolution GC-MS results indicate low kerogen maturation after 72 hours using saturated biomarker compounds as thermal maturity indicator, such as 22S/(22S + 22R) of C31 to C35 homohopanes, tricyclics/17(H)-hopanes, and Ts/(Ts + Tm). Bulk carbon isotope value of bitumen decreases with time, with 2.5‰ lighter than original kerogen after 72 hours. In terms of different groups, saturated hydrocarbons and resins become depleted in 13C with longer reaction time, while aromatics and asphaltenes become enriched in 13C.\nExperiments with longer reaction time and under different physicochemical conditions are underway. That would facilitate a better understanding of oil and gas generation and carbon isotope systematics during kerogen maturation processes for effective conventional and unconventional exploration.",

            "abstract": "Arctic soil organic matter (SOM) mineralization processes are fundamental to the functioning of high latitude soils in relation to nutrients, stability, and feedbacks to atmospheric CO2 and climate. The arctic permafrost zone covers 25% of the northern hemisphere and contains 1672Pg of soil carbon (C). 88% of this C currently resides in frozen soils that are vulnerable to environmental change. For instance, arctic growing seasons may be lengthened, resulting in an increase in plant productivity and rate of below ground labile C inputs as root exudates. Understanding controls on Arctic SOM dynamics requires recognition that labile C inputs have the potential to significantly affect mineralization of previously stable SOM, also known as ‘priming effects’. We conducted a substrate addition incubation experiment to quantify and compare respiration in highly organic (42-48 %C) permafrost soils along a north-south transect in western Canada. Near surface soils (10-20 cm) were collected from permafrost peatland sites in the Mackenzie River Basin from 69.2-62.6°N. The surface soils are fairly young (Δ14C values > -140.0) and can be assumed to contain relatively reactive soil carbon. To assess whether addition of labile substrate alters SOM decomposition dynamics, 4.77-11.75 g of permafrost soil were spiked with 0.5 mg D-glucose g-1 soil and incubated at 5°C. A mass balance approach was used to determin substrate-induced respiration and preliminary results suggest a potential for positive priming in these C-rich soils. Baseline respiration rates from the three sites were similar (0.067-0.263 mg CO2 g-1 soil C) yet show some site-specific trends. The rate at which added substrate was utilized within these soils suggests that other factors besides temperature and soil C content are controlling substrate consumption and its effect on SOM decomposition. Microbial activity can be stimulated by substrate addition to such an extent that SOM turnover is enhanced, suggesting that soil C decay rates and processes are not constant, but depend on the inter-soil dynamics of other soil C pools. If these C rich soils contain ample C-resources to fuel extra microbial SOM decomposition, then possibly this enhanced use of SOM is not as a means of C acquisition, but to mobilize nutrients needed to meet microbial growth requirements.",

            "abstract": "The research was initiated as a part of the Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments (NGEE) in the Arctic and also as a part of the Integrated Ecosystem Model for Alaska. The presented project explores influence of climate (mean annual and summer temperatures, and snow cover depth and density) and physical properties, soil textures and moisture content on thawing and destabilization of ice wedges on the North Slope of Alaska.\nRecall that ice wedges formed many years ago, when ground cracked and the cracks were filled by water. The infiltrated water then became frozen and turned into ice. When the annual and summer air temperatures become higher, the depth of the active layer increases. Deeper seasonal thawing may cause melting of the ice wedges from their tops. Consequently, the ground starts to settle and a trough form above the ice wedge. Once the trough is formed, the winter snow cover becomes deeper above it and provides a potential feedback mechanism to the further degradation of permafrost.\nThe work deals with analysis of temperature regimes and moisture distribution and dynamics during seasonal cycles of freezing and thawing. The research focuses on the development of a computational approach to the study of seasonal temperature dynamics of the active layer, ice wedge and surrounding it permafrost. A thermo-mechanical model of the ice wedge based on principles of macroscopic thermodynamics and continuum mechanics is presented. The model includes the energy and mass conservation equations, a visco-poroelastic rheology for ground deformation, and an empirical formula which relates unfrozen water content to temperature. The complete system is reduced to a computationally convenient set of coupled equations for the temperature, pore water pressure, ground velocities and porosity in a two-dimensional domain. A finite element method and an implicit scheme in time were utilized to construct a non-linear system of equations, which was solved iteratively. The model employs temperature and moisture content data collected from a field experiment at the NGEE sites in Barrow, Alaska. The model describes seasonal dynamics of temperature, water and ground motion near ice wedges and helps to explain destabilization of the ice wedges north of the Alaska's Brook Range.",

            "abstract": "The Colorado Front Range is a unique geographical region for air quality studies, including research of surface level ozone. Not only does surface ozone play a critical role in regulating the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere, but is a primary contributor to local smog and leads to public health complications and altered ecosystem functioning. The high frequency of sunny days, increasing population and pollution, and Mountain/Valley air dynamics of this region provide atmospheric conditions suitable for production and accumulation of ozone at the surface. This region of Colorado is currently in an ozone non-attainment status due to an assortment of contributing factors. Precursor emissions from pollution, wild-fires, and gas and oil production; along with stratosphere-troposphere exchange, can all result in high ozone episodes over the Colorado Front Range. To understand the dynamics of ozone accumulation in this region, Thermo-Scientific ozone monitors have been continuously sampling ozone from 4 different altitudes since the early 2000s. Analysis of ozone data in relation to Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), Methane (CH4), Carbon Monoxide (CO), wind-conditions and back-trajectory air mass origins help to address local ozone precursor emissions and resulting high ozone episodes. Increased ozone episodes are scrutinized with regards to dominant wind direction to determine main precursor emission sources. Analysis of this data reveals a strong influence of precursor emissions from the North-East wind sector, with roughly 50% of ozone exceedances originating from winds prevailing from this direction. Further, correlation with methane is enhanced when prevailing winds are from the North-East; indicative of influence from natural gas processes and feedlot activity. Similar analysis is completed for the North-West wind sector exceedances, with strong correlation to carbon monoxide; likely related to emissions from biomass burning events and forest fires. In depth analysis of ozone exceedances allows for further understanding of variability in the long-term and seasonal trends. Knowledge of Colorado Front Range ozone dynamics is imperative for future regulations on this important pollutant.",

            "abstract": "Alpine and arctic tree line expansion relies on tree seedling survival above the tree line, where the environment is harsh and protection by snow during winter is essential. Above the tree line, bryophytes are dominant; they may act as thermal insulators but their insulating ability differs between species. Apart from these positive effects, both snow and bryophytes may have negative effects on seedlings via shortening of the growing season or competition, respectively. Snow depth and duration are expected to change due to climate change, leading in some places to more snow and in others to less. What is the role of bryophytes insulating properties for seedling establishment under changing winter conditions at the alpine tree line? We hypothesized that protecting effects of snow and bryophytes would be more important for seedling survival in harsh climate (high elevation) than in milder climate (low elevation) (interactions: bryophyte*elevation and snow*elevation) and that negative effects of less snow would be ameliorated by well-insulating bryophytes (interaction: bryophyte*snow). To test this, we transplanted cores of three bryophyte species of differing insulation capacity and bare soil (control) from the subarctic tree line (~600m asl.) to 700 and 350 m asl. We transplanted 10 seedlings of two common tree line tree species (Betula pubescens and Pinus sylvestris) into each core in late summer. Cores were subjected to one of three snow treatments: autumn and spring snow removal or addition, or no manipulation. After the winter we scored seedling survival. The snow treatments had different effects at the two elevations (elevation* snow: P<0.0001) whereas bryophytes did not (elevation*bryophyte: n.s). In the harsh climate, snow addition generally enhanced seedling survival. In contrast, at the milder climate site, snow addition only increased survival in the bare soil treatment but decreased survival of seedlings in the bryophyte cores (bryophyte*snow: P=0.053). Our data show that snow cover is the dominant, positive control on winter survival of tree seedlings above the current tree line, irrespective of the bryophyte cover. In a milder climate, however, the role of snow cover depends on the bryophyte cover, with negative effects of extra snow on seedling survival in the presence of bryophytes and vice versa.",

            "abstract": "True polar wander (TPW) is the motion of the crust and mantle relative to the spin axis due to changes in the Earth’s moment of inertia. Paleomagnetic studies assume that plate tectonic speeds have been relatively constant through time, and thus observations of large, rapid movements in paleomagnetic poles have been attributed to true polar wander. A large TPW event would result in a dramatic repositioning of the continents relative to the equatorial oceanic bulge and the ecliptic, causing changes in relative sea level, potentially altering the Earth’s global oceanic circulation patterns and biogeochemical cycles. Mantle density anomalies such as plumes, which are linked to large igneous provinces, can affect Earth’s moment of inertia and cause TPW. It has been suggested that a superplume triggered a ca. 800 Ma episode of large scale TPW (Li et al., EPSL, 2004). Additionally, the mantle plume associated with the ca. 615-535 Ma Central Iapetus Magmatic event and rifting of Laurentia’s eastern margin has been proposed as a possible trigger for TPW (Kirschvink et al., AGU, 2005). Here we combine plume advection and rotational dynamics models to investigate the hypothesis that Neoproterozoic TPW events were initiated by mantle plumes. For each plume event, we estimate plume radius and current location of the plume center from published geologic observations. The location of plume center is rotated using paleomagnetic data to obtain the paleolatitude of the plume at the time of eruption. Plumes consistent with the estimated sizes are advected from the core mantle boundary. The spherical flow fields are calculated using the propagator matrix method and advection is done via a flux-corrected transport algorithm. Using the output from the advection model and the estimated paleolatitude of eruption, the TPW is calculated using the quasi-fluid approximation to the nonlinear rotational dynamics equations. For each event investigated, we explore variations due to changing the viscosity contrast between the upper and lower mantle, adding a lithosphere, and changing the reference shape. The model-generated TPW is compared to paleomagnetic data. Current results suggest that the Ediacaran TPW seen in the paleomagnetic record may be consistent with that expected from the mantle plume associated with the Central Iapetus Magmatic event.",

            "abstract": "The Sawtooth batholith in south-central Idaho is one of the largest Eocene epizonal plutons that intrudes the Cretaceous Atlanta lobe of the Idaho batholith. The batholith is part of a suite of Eocene plutons associated with the voluminous Challis volcanic field in central Idaho. Intense hydrothermal systems within and surrounding this and other Eocene plutons have been likened in scale to the modern Yellowstone hydrothermal systems. The two-feldspar, subsolvus, granites are characterized by pink alkali feldspar, variable amounts of hornblende, biotite, and titanite, a lack of deformation, minor alteration to sericite and/or secondary muscovite, and porosity. The presence of miarolytic cavities and porosity together with additional constraints suggests P-T conditions near 650°C and 1.5 kbar. Previous K-Ar biotite ages suggested that the Sawtooth pluton was intruded at about 47-45 Ma, but no modern geochronology has been performed on the alkali feldspar-rich granites of the Sawtooth batholith.\nNew U-Pb zircon analyses (LA-MC-ICP-MS) of samples from the Sawtooth pluton have been challenging due to Pb loss and high common Pb likely associated with the hydrothermal alteration. Two spatially separated samples from the northern portion of the batholith, however, yield sufficient concordant zircons with low common Pb to indicate a crystallization age of 47.1 +/- 0.7 Ma and 46.6 +/- 0.6 Ma (2 s.e.m.), respectively. Ar/Ar analyses of biotite and muscovite from the Sawtooth plutons and metasedimentary country rocks yield cooling ages of about 47 to 45 Ma, consistent with very rapid post-crystallization cooling at shallow crustal levels. Other biotite Ar/Ar analyses, however, yield cooling ages as young as about 25 Ma, most of which have discordant age spectra. These samples suffer from chlorite intergrowths associated with the Eocene hydrothermal system and are less retentive than primary biotite. The Miocene cooling ages of the altered biotites are similar to U-Th/He ages of apatite from the Sawtooth Range, and suggest that exhumation associated with displacement on the Sawtooth normal fault commenced in early Miocene time. U-Pb ages of zircon xenocrysts and Lu-Hf isotopic data from Eocene magmatic zircons suggest the source of the Sawtooth magmas is dominated by Proterozoic crustal material.",

            "abstract": "The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) represents a prominent mode of intraseasonal tropical variability. It is manifest by coherent large-scale changes in atmospheric circulation, convection, and thermodynamic processes. Preconditioning of the environment prior to the active phase of the MJO has been noted, but the balance of theorized mechanisms to accomplish this process remains unresolved. Further, there is a lack of consensus on the means by which primary initiation of an MJO event occurs. Observational and modeling efforts have recently been undertaken to advance our understanding of the physical underpinnings governing MJO development. However these intensive studies are often limited in space and/or time and are potentially subject to model deficiencies. Satellite observations, especially those providing vertical resolution of temperature and moisture, provide an opportunity to expand our knowledge of processes critical to MJO initiation and preconditioning.\nThis work will provide an analysis of suppressed phase thermodynamics with an emphasis on the use of a complementary suite of satellite observations including AIRS/AMSU-A profiles, CERES radiative fluxes, and cloud properties observed by MODIS. Emphasis of this work will regard the distribution of cloud regimes, their radiative-convective effects, and their relationship to moist static energy during the recharge and suppressed stages of MJO initiation and eastward propagation. The analyses will make use of cloud regimes from MODIS observations to provide a compositing technique that enables the identification of systematic connections between different cloud regimes and the larger scale environment. Within these cloud regimes, the relationship between the associated cloud-radiative effects observed by CERES, vertically-resolved and vertically-integrated thermodynamics using AIRS/AMSU-A observations, and atmospheric boundary layer fluxes will be demonstrated.",

Current vegetation conditions were derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite observations, and potential vegetation over China was obtained from Ramankutty and Foley’s global potential vegetation dataset. Impacts of land cover changes on surface air temperature and precipitation are assessed based on the difference of the two experiments. Results suggest that land cover changes have a cold-season cooling effect in a large region of China, but a warming effect in summer. These temperature changes can be reconciled with albedo forcing and evapotranspiration. Moreover, impacts on atmospheric circulation and the Asian Monsoon is also discussed.",

            "abstract": "The surface of Europa is crisscrossed by tectonic features generally attributed to time-dependent tidal deformations. For a long time, the membrane theory of elastic shells (thin shell or flattening model) has been popular to predict tidal tectonic patterns because it provides simple analytical formulas for tidal stresses. More recently, the theory of viscoelastic-gravitational deformations (or thick shell model) was applied to tidal tectonics so as to include viscoelastic effects. This method, however, is not transparent to the user and relies on numerical algorithms that are not always publicly available or fully benchmarked. As an alternative, we propose here to extend membrane theory to viscoelastic shells with depth-dependent rheology. Viscoelasticity is taken into account by replacing elastic constants with effective viscoelastic parameters that are easily computed for a given rheology. The membrane approach thus leads to simple formulas for viscoelastic tidal stresses. Because of its formulation in terms of tidal Love numbers, the membrane approach has clear relationships with both thin and thick shell models. Benchmarking with the thick-shell software SatStress leads to the discovery of an error in that code that changes stress components by up to 40%. As an application, we show that different stress-free states account for the conflicting predictions of thin and thick shell models about the magnitude of tensile stresses due to nonsynchronous rotation.",

            "abstract": "In evaluating a future scenario for air quality, one can identify four major causal factors: (1) global emissions that alter atmospheric composition and thence baseline levels of surface ozone (O3); (2) global changes in climate that also alter these baselines (e.g., temperature, water vapor); (3) climate-driven changes in the meteorological regimes of polluted regions that lead to air quality extreme (AQX) episodes; and (4) changes in the efficacy of local emissions to produce pollution within a governance region. While these factors are all part of a coupled system, a model that combines all would be difficult to verify. Thus an assessment approach would be to evaluate each factor separately using observations and an ensemble of models. In this study, we focus on factor (3), evaluating the ability of the models in the Atmospheric Chemistry & Climate Model Intercomparison Project (ACCMIP) to reproduce the observed present-day climatology (e.g. diurnal/seasonal cycles, AQX episode size) of surface O3 in North America (NA) and Europe (EU). We then characterize future changes within these domains as well as south Asia (SA) for two experiments of RCP8.5 climate, one with O3 precursor emissions representative of the 2100s (RCP8.5) and one representative of the 2000s (Cl2100Em2000). We find that most models simulate the observed climatology well, albeit biased high over the range of each domain’s probability distribution (Fig. 1). For RCP8.5, the ensemble mean shows an increase of ~10% in the mean annual maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) over all domains, with the largest changes in winter months. For Cl2100Em2000, NA shows a small increase (+1%) in annual mean MDA8 while EU and SA show small decreases (-2% and -3%, respectively). Also for RCP8.5, most models show decreases in the mean size (S) and mean duration (D) of AQX episodes in EU (S = -28%, D = -17%) and increases in SA (+54%, +15%). The ensemble mean shows decreases in D (-7%) and increases in S (+21%) in NA, but the sign of the change in S is split between the models. For Cl2100Em2000, we find similar but smaller changes in EU (-10%, -11%) and SA (+16%, +5%), and small decreases in NA (-3%, -8%). Thus we conclude future changes in AQX episode size to be driven more so by changes in precursor emissions rather than climate. This also applies to changes in duration for SA but is reversed for NA and EU.",

            "abstract": "Polar Mesospheric Clouds (PMCs) are ice layers forming just below the mesopause in the summer polar region. Their frequency of occurrence and brightness have been shown to vary inversely with the solar cycle. This is not unexpected as increases in solar irradiance warm the atmosphere and increase the photolysis of water, both of which decrease the efficiency of ice layer formation. PMC frequency of occurrence and brightness have also been shown to have a long-term positive trend. It has been suggested that this trend is the result of increased greenhouse gas concentrations. The trends could be caused by increases in radiative cooling, but recent model results suggest that greenhouse gas increases in the stratosphere lead to a shrinking of the atmosphere which results in a small net cooling at PMC altitudes.\nIn May of 2007, the Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM) satellite mission began observing PMCs for the purpose of understanding the causes of their formation and variability. The Solar Occultation for Ice Experiment (SOFIE) on AIM measures both PMC ice properties and the temperature of the air in which the ice forms. SOFIE has shown that over the course of the AIM mission, the temperature at PMC altitudes has generally decreased, while PMC ice mass has generally increased. This result is supported by observations from AIM’s Cloud Imaging and Particle Size (CIPS) experiment. While this inverse relationship is as expected, the trends are opposite to expectations as solar activity has generally increased during the period of AIM observations. This suggests that another forcing is overwhelming the effects of solar activity, at least for this particular solar cycle. The two key candidate forcings are hemispheric teleconnections, which have been shown to influence polar mesospheric temperatures and PMCs, and greenhouse gas increases.\nIn this talk, we examine observations from SOFIE, the Sounding of the Atmosphere by Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER), and the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) to look at the decadal variation of polar mesosphere temperature at PMC altitudes and disentangle the relative effects of solar cycle and greenhouse gas forcings. We will also examine the possibility of trends in teleconnections.",

            "abstract": "Spectral wave models based on the wave action equation typically use a depth uniform current to account for the current effect on waves. The choice of this depth uniform current is formally arbitrary; recently, several studies have made use of the depth-weighted current due to Skop (1987) or Kirby & Chen (1989). These applications do not typically take into account the change in the expression for the wave action flux, which results from the dependence of the depth-weighted current on wavenumber k.  Recently, Dong and Kirby (2014) have derived a multiple-scale asymptotic theory for the case of wave-current interaction with strongly sheared mean flows. At leading order, the Rayleigh equation governs the wave motion, and a wave action equation (identical to that of Voronovich, 1976) follows from consideration of a solvability condition at second order. Incorporation of this result in existing wave models would require extensive code revisions and is left for future work. Instead, we investigate the suitability of the perturbation solutions by examining predictions of wave action density and flux in comparison to results from the full theory. To facilitate this, a revision to the perturbation solution of Kirby & Chen (1989) has been derived based on a strong current; weak shear approach. Wave action and action flux are evaluated using both depth averaged and depth-weighted approximations, and are compared with numerical solutions based on the Rayleigh equation. In particular, deriving an expression for group velocity as the derivative of frequency with respect to k suggests that an additional term k∂u/∂k should appear. This term has not been accounted for in existing extensions to the depth-uniform current equations. To illustrate the importance of this effect in the absolute group velocity, a comparison of group velocity with and without the additional term is made. The results show that significant errors are incurred in neglecting the additional term, pointing to the need for a more careful application of the approach in existing models.",

            "abstract": "A 62-story residential tower in San Francisco—the tallest all-residential building in California—was recently instrumented by the USGS’s National Strong Motion Project in collaboration with the Strong Motion Instrumentation Program of the California Geological Survey to monitor the motion of a tall building built with specifically engineered features (including buckling-restrained braces, outrigger columns and a tuned liquid damper) to reduce its sway from seismic and wind loads. This 641-ft tower has been outfitted with 72 uni-axial accelerometers, spanning through 26 different levels of the building. For damage detection and localization through structural health monitoring, we use local micro-earthquake and ambient monitoring (background noises) to define linear-elastic (undamaged) dynamic properties of the superstructure including its modal parameters (fundamental frequencies, mode shapes and modal damping values) and shear-wave propagation profile and wave attenuation inside the building, which need to be determined in advance of strong shaking. In order to estimate the baseline modal parameters, we applied a frequency domain decomposition method. Using this method, the first three bending modes in the reference east-west direction, the first two bending modes in the reference north-south direction, and the first two torsional modes were identified. The shear-wave propagation and wave attenuation inside the building were computed using deconvolution interferometry. The data used for analyses are from ambient vibrations having 20 minutes duration, and earthquake data from a local M4.5 event located just north east of Geyserville, California. We show that application of deconvolution interferometry to data recorded inside a building is a powerful technique for monitoring structural parameters, such as velocities of traveling waves, frequencies of normal modes, and intrinsic attenuation (i.e., damping). The simplicity and similarity of the deconvolved waveforms from ambient vibrations and a small magnitude event also suggest that a one-dimensional shear velocity model is sufficiently accurate to represent the wave propagation charactersistics inside the building.",

Instrumental and paleoclimate data indicate that hydroclimate varies more strongly at multidecadal to millennial time frequencies than at interannual frequencies. Multi-millennial control runs in both ESM2Mb and ESM2G reproduce strong temperature variance at multi-century to millennial scales in the Northern Hemisphere (20°N-90°N). However, ESM2Mb does not reproduce strong multi-decadal to millennial precipitation variance in the Northern Hemisphere, whereas ESM2G captures strong multi-century scale precipitation variance in the Northern Hemisphere. In the tropics (20°S-20°N), these models do not reproduce strong multi-decadal to millennial precipitation and temperature variance as compared to interannual variance. Our findings suggest that the latest IPCC AR5 climate models are likely to underestimate the background risk of multidecadal hydroclimatic variability (drought).

            "abstract": "As observations become more plentiful through remote sensing and numerical models become increasingly sophisticated, a clear priority of the ice sheet modeling community is to compare model simulations with observations. Temperature and velocity conditions within the Greenland ice sheet and at the bed remain largely unknown with the exception of sparse borehole measurements, but much can be inferred from rigorous thermo-mechanically coupled modeling. Surface velocities on the Greenland ice sheet are well constrained, both from satellite imagery and field observations. We take advantage of the observed surface velocities at the PARCA stakes around the 2,000m elevation contour of the ice sheet as modeling targets that represent a broad range of flow characteristics in different regions. Prescribing ice geometry, we use a two-dimensional thermo-mechanically coupled model to calculate ‘steady-state’ velocity and temperature profiles throughout the depth of the ice along flowlines from the main divide to the 2,000m elevation contour. Vertical velocity calculations are based on first principles of mass conservation, accounting for convergence and divergence of the streamtube width, and the enthalpy-based temperature calculations also incorporate the effects of liquid water content in temperate ice through the flow law parameter. Numerous insights from our simulations are presented for different regions, such as the influence of variable geothermal heat flux, the treatment of basal boundary conditions, and appropriate enhancement factors based on the age of ice. Results indicate that areas of temperate bed do exist in the high-elevation interior in certain sections of Greenland. Also highlighted is the importance of including temperature calculations in ice sheet modeling, particularly in regions with a temperate bed. For example, on the west coast, computations assuming a constant temperature of -5°C result in a 41% underestimation of the surface velocity at the 2,000m elevation location. In contrast, a full thermo-mechanical simulation produces surface velocities that agree well with observations.",

            "abstract": "The bi-directionality of ammonia (NH3) exchange in canopies is influenced by changes in the atmosphere, vegetation, and soils. Accurate simulation of exchange processes is challenging due to uncertainties in stomatal compensation point, soil resistances, and other key inputs. As part of a study to quantify NH3 emissions from fertilized maize in the Midwestern U.S., the SURFATM-NH3 model was used to simulate NH3 flux using measurement data (chemical flux, micrometeorology, and soil) collected over an entire growing season from May-September 2014. Initial simulations reveal that NH3 flux predictions display a statistically significant correlation with atmospheric variables that influence the transfer of moisture and energy (i.e. temperature, relative humidity, radiation). A function that describes the relationship between the emission potentials, meteorological data, and the vegetative canopy flux is also observed, which could be utilized by future studies to increase the accuracy of forecasting the source/sink behavior of the NH3 canopy flux.",

Soft electron precipitation serves as a heat source for the ambient F-region ionospheric electrons, which enhances the ambipolar electric field and induces upflowing ions.

            "abstract": "In semi-arid rangeland environments understanding how surface and subsurface flow processes and their interactions are influenced by watershed and rainfall characteristics is critical. However, it is difficult to resolve the temporal variations between mechanisms controlling these processes and challenging to obtain field measurements that document their interactions. Better insight into how these complex systems respond hydrologically is necessary in order to refine hydrologic models and decision support tools. We are conducting field studies integrating high resolution, two-dimensional surface electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) with variable intensity rainfall simulation, to quantify real-time partitioning of rainfall into surface and subsurface response. These studies are being conducted at the hillslope scale on long-term runoff plots on four different ecological sites in the Upper Crow Creek Watershed in southeastern Wyoming. Variable intensity rainfall rates were applied using the Walnut Gulch Rainfall Simulator in which intensities were increased incrementally from 49 to 180 mm hr-1 and steady-state runoff rates for each intensity were measured. Two 13.5 m electrode arrays at 0.5 m spacing were positioned on the surface perpendicular to each plot and potentials were measured at given time intervals prior to, during and following simulations using a dipole-dipole array configuration. The configuration allows for a 2.47 m depth of investigation in which magnitude and direction of subsurface flux can be determined. We used the calculated steady state infiltration rates to quantify the variability in the partial area runoff response on the ecological sites. Coupling this information with time-lapse difference inversions of ERI data, we are able to track areas of increasing and decreasing resistivity in the subsurface related to localized areas of infiltration during and following rainfall events. We anticipate implementing this method across a variety of ecological sites in the Upper Crow Creek in order to characterize the variable hydrologic response of this complex rangeland watershed. This information is being used to refine current physically based hydrologic models and watershed assessment tools.",

            "abstract": "Foreshock sequences have been observed to occur before large earthquakes. They may provide short-term information regarding the timing of the impending event. Our current understanding of stress states encouraging foreshock generation is limited. Geodetic data from Tohoku and north Chile sequences indicate that foreshocks occur on the frictionally locked section of the fault [Brodsky and Lay, 2014]. McLaskey et al. [2012] have shown that foreshocks can be simulated on frictional interfaces in the laboratory and demonstrate physics that scale directly to large regional earthquakes [McLaskey et al., 2014].\nWe present findings on a PMMA-PMMA frictional interface in a direct shear configuration, where a catalogue of 68 foreshocks preceding 8 large rupture events along the interface were studied at four levels of normal load. A pressure sensitive film was used to locate, size and measure normal stress on individual asperity. Slow slip was observed to nucleate from the free edge and grew (at rates between 3 to 12 mm/s) into a ‘locked’ section of the fault and was fully dependent on the applied normal load. Within the ‘locked’ region, an increase in size and densities of asperities were present. As the nucleation zone grew into the locked region, foreshocks were recorded using absolutely calibrated acoustic emission (AE) sensor and were modeled using a double-couple source mechanism. The source radius, approximated using the Brune [1970] relationship, ranged from 0.21 to 1.09 mm – similar to film estimates for larger asperity radii in that region. Spatio-temporal distributions of foreshocks showed decreasing recurrence times (~ 10 s to 0.001 s) as they clustered towards the eventual main shock hypocenter. We observed a pronounced dependence between the magnitude of foreshocks in a sequence and the energy released during full rupture; suggesting that foreshock size may be an indicator for potential magnitude of the main shock.",

            "abstract": "The mid-Pleistocene transition (MPT) marked a fundamental change in glacial-interglacial periodicity, when it increased from ~41- to 100-kyr cycles and developed higher amplitude climate variability. Because it took place without significant changes in the Milankovitch forcing, this fundamental change must reflect either non-linear responses of the climate system to these external forcings, or internal changes in the ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere system that led to longer periodicities and more intense glacial periods. We document using Nd isotopes a major disruption of the ocean thermohaline circulation (THC) system during the MPT between MIS 25-21 at ~950-860 ka, which effectively marks the first 100-kyr cycle, including an exceptional weakening through critical interglacial MIS 23 at ~900 ka. The data are from ODP Sites 1088 (41°8.163'S, 13°33.77'E, 2082m) and 1090 (42°54.82'S, 8°53.98E', 3702m) in the SE Atlantic Subantarctic Zone, near the upper and lower boundaries of NADW and Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW). Given evidence for nearly stable NADW and North Pacific Water (NPW) εNd-values over the last 2 Ma, we interpret the εNd variations to reflect changes in the NADW:NPW mixing fractions. During the studied pre-MPT 41-kyr world (MIS 31-25, 1,100–950 ka), at both sites the differences in glacial and interglacial εNd-values are small, indicating strong glacial as well as interglacial export of NADW. A major weakening of NADW export occurred during MIS 24-22, including MIS 23, which is unique as the only known interglacial in which the THC did not strengthen, and thus can be considered as a 'trans-glacial’ period. The recovery into the post-MPT 100-kyr world is characterized by continued weak glacial THC. We conclude that the MPT ocean circulation crisis 'rebooted' the pacing and intensity of ice ages and facilitated the coeval drawdown of atmospheric CO2 and high latitude ice sheet growth, generating the conditions that stabilized 100-kyr cycles.",

A promising method for reducing uncertainty in predictions of carbon-climate feedbacks is based on identifying an “emergent constraint\" that leverages correlations between mechanistically linked long-term feedbacks and short-term variations within the model ensemble. By applying contemporary observations to evaluate model skill in simulating short-term variations, we may be able to better assess the probability of simulated long-term feedbacks.\nWe probed the constraint on long-term terrestrial carbon stocks provided by climate-driven fluctuations in the atmospheric CO2 growth rate at contemporary timescales. We considered the impact of both temperature and precipitation anomalies on terrestrial ecosystem exchange and further separated the direct influence of fire where possible. When we explicitly considered the role of atmospheric transport in smoothing the imprint of climate-driven flux anomalies on atmospheric CO2 patterns, we found that the extent of temporal averaging of both the observations and ESM output leads to estimates for the long-term climate sensitivity of tropical land carbon storage that are different by a factor of two.\nIn the context of these results, we discuss strategies for applying emergent constraints for benchmarking biogeochemical feedbacks in ESMs. Specifically, our results underscore the importance of selecting appropriate observational benchmarks and, for future model intercomparison projects, outputting fields that most closely correspond to available observational datasets.",

In this region, the pristine air conditions over the Amazon regularly interacts with the pollution plume extending from Manaus. Observations from the AMF instrumentation are used to analyze the relationship between clouds and the thermodynamic environment in this rarely observed region. Pertinent AMF instruments for determining cloud properties include the 95—GHz W-band ARM Cloud Radar (WACR), micropulse lidar, and Vaisala ceilometer. Observations from these instruments are merged to determine cloud boundaries, and time-height fields of quality-controlled radar moments and linear depolarization ratios. Profiles of cloud frequency and occurrence for the first year’s deployment are examined in the context of the dry and wet seasons and through seasonal transitions. Additional context for cloud statistics are provided using sounding observations of convective indices including convective available potential energy, convective inhibition, and planetary boundary layer height.",

The sensitivity of SIP to bulk and interfacial physicochemical properties permits a wider range of hydrogeophysical and environmental applications, including monitoring of subsurface biogeochemical transformations. Improvements in instrumentation and experimental designs, along with faster acquisition capabilities and easy access to processing routines are encouraging novel applications of the method, and support quantitative interpretation of the data acquired.\nMotivated by recent research that focus on small scale changes, over large frequency ranges, we performed a series of experiments to identify the accuracy of common laboratory SIP experimental set ups. We performed measurements on resistor – capacitor (RC) networks, to identify the instrumentation accuracy, and also on standard laboratory columns filled with materials of known SIP response, primarily on well characterized fluids of different conductivity. Early results show small errors in the low frequency range, attributed to electrode polarization; in higher frequencies, typically above 1000 Hz, the errors may become significant limiting the meaningful interpretation of small phase angles at these frequencies. The data will be compared with published data using comparable experimental set ups, and could be used to set realistic expectations on future SIP experiments and applications. With this work we aim at developing a best practices document that can aid the SIP user in collecting meaningful and repeatable results.",

            "abstract": "Comprehensive knowledge of the oxygen fugacity of the upper mantle is critical to understanding the processes associated with melt production, interaction, and extraction. Thus, it is important to understand how fO2 changes during a peridotite’s thermal and petrologic history in the asthenospheric and lithospheric mantle, as metamorphic subsolidus reequilibration can result in changes to recorded fO2.\nA case study of Tongan forearc peridotites highlights the heterogeneity seen in mantle peridotites. We analyzed two dredges located 250 km apart along the trench: one dredge ranges in fO2 from 0.5 to 1 log unit above the QFM buffer, similar to analyses of supra-subduction zone xenoliths (e.g. Brandon and Draper, 1996; Wood and Virgo, 1989) while the other dredge ranges from QFM-0.75 to QFM+0.25 and exhibits high spinel Cr# (ranging from 0.45 to 0.75). Systematics between fO2, Ti concentration, olivine forsterite content, and Cr# within each dredge allow us to differentiate between the effects of melt extraction, melt interaction, and cooling.\nBecause the spinel oxybarometry equation is dependent on temperature, it is important to be able to accurately determine the temperature recorded by peridotites. Though many geothermometers are available for mantle rocks, we assert that geothermometers based on Fe-Mg exchange between olivine and spinel are the most applicable to fO2 calculations, because the oxygen fugacity recorded by a mantle assemblage is primarily controlled by this exchange. Additionally, preliminary analyses of diffusion profiles across olivine-spinel grain boundaries provide insight into the cooling of peridotite in the oceanic lithosphere and its effects on oxygen fugacity. Mg-Fe exchange between olivine and spinel is controlled by the distribution coefficient, KD, which is dependent on both temperature and the proportion of Cr to other trivalent cations in spinel. We see an increase in olivine forsterite content towards the olivine-spinel interface, consistent with an increase in KD as cooling occurs. Limited data indicate that while spinel Cr# decreases as the interface is approached, no change is seen in spinel Fe3+/ΣFe ratios. As a result, the increased Fo# in olivine dominates the oxybarometry equation, resulting in higher oxygen fugacity values near the interface as cooling occurs.",

            "abstract": "Chilika Lake, the largest Asian lagoon on the east coast of India, has a surface area of 1160 km2 or about 900 km2, respectively for the wet, monsoon vs. dry winter-spring season. The average depth is only about 1.2 m. It is separated from the Bay of Bengal by a 100 m to 1.5 km wide sand bar of about 30 km length, separating the outer channel that connects the lagoon naturally to the sea. Long-shore development of this sand bar as of the Late Holocene increasingly isolated the lagoon from the sea, until final closure in 1992. Given the population increase in the catchment and according changes in land use policies, agricultural practices, and water resource management, Chilika Lake has been subjected to increasing anthropogenic influence. As a consequence the unique biodiversity and also primary production within the lagoon decreased, while eutrophication and siltation increased. As a counter-initiative it was decided to artificially open the lagoon to the sea by dredging.\nTo help trace and quantify the anthropologic effects on Chilika Lake, a combined sedimentologic, chemical, and isotopic study of the lagoon and its sediments was is in progress. First results from a campaign during the monsoon season suggest that the large gradients in salinity, sediment and nutrient input, as well as primary productivity within the lagoon are controlled by variable fluxes of water, sediment, and nutrients from the three separate catchments to the lagoon. Trends in changes of salinity, H- and O-isotope compositions of waters, but also of concentrations and C- and/or N-isotope compositions of the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), particulate organic matter (POM), and aquatic plants indicate that mixing in the lagoon occurs between new freshwater inputs and evaporated water within the basin itself. Except for the outer channel, mixing with seawater is limited. In contrast, the C-isotope composition of the organic matter in the sediments either suggests a higher overall proportion of “marine” or of estuarine-derived POM during the past. The latter may be important during the dry season, coupling salinity increase to the changes in DIC and POM carbon isotope compositions. The salinity-DIC-H-, O-, C-isotope compositions of water are compatible with evaporation as the main driver for salinity increase, rather than admixtures with seawater.",

For the application of the Neural Network (NN) method, we use the magnitude of the horizontal (H) component of the magnetic field measured with magnetometers at Jicamarca and Piura (Peru). The data was collected between the years 2002 and 2013. In training the NN we use the difference between the magnitudes of the horizontal components (dH) measured at JRO (placed at the magnetic equator) and Piura (displaced 5° away). Additional parameters used are F10.7 and Ap indexes. The estimates obtained with the NN procedure are very good. We have an RMS error of 3.7 m/s using dH as an input of the NN while the error is 3.9 m/s when we use the component H of JRO as an input. The results are validated using the set of vertical drifts observations collected with the Jicamarca incoherent scatter radar. The estimated drifts can be accessed using the following website: http://jro.igp.gob.pe/driftnn. In the poster, we show the comparison of vertical drifts from 2002 to 2013 where we discuss the agreement between magnetometer and ISR data.",

As part of the recent studies that have focused on monitoring eruptive behavior for risk reduction in this heavily populated area, we are updating the Hazard Map (1995).\nHere we present the results of the new data for the northwestern sector of the volcano where large mudflows reached 40km from the volcano toward Mexico City (14Ka). The 5Ka mudflows are overlain by several flows that covered pre-Columbian pre-classic settlements at around 2Ka BP. Buildings with ceramics from the classic and postclassic periods (around 1.5Ka and 0.9Ka BP) also indicate that settlements were abandoned and resettled several hundred years later. So far, it seems that inhabitants fled at the beginning of these larger eruptions, since no bodies have been found in the excavations. Since the XVI century, several smaller mudflows have reached the towns, but many are related with secondary deposits (for example, the Nexapa 2010 mudflow reached 15 km from the crater). Although this area has been inhabited for thousands of years, increased population shows that risk is considerable.",

At large distances, ionospheric targets become overspread or susceptible to range-Doppler ambiguities (long range: > 1000 km and high velocity: ~1 km/s). Ionospheric radars, such as the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) radars employ the multiple-pulse technique to overcome these ambiguities at the expense of introducing self-clutter. The present study utilizes measurements of echo power to estimate self-clutter, which can be used to provide signal-derived estimates of the mean square error in radar observations.",

            "abstract": "The state of stress in forearc regions depends on two competing factors: stress coupling along the plate interface that generates margin-normal compression, and gravity which generates margin-normal tension. Studies of focal mechanisms of small earthquakes indicate that the 2011 Tohoku earthquake changed the stress state over much of the Japan Trench forearc from margin-normal compression to tension. That is, the plate coupling effect was dominant in controlling forearc stresses before the earthquake, but the gravitational effect has become dominant after the earthquake. This change requires either (1) a nearly complete stress drop on a strong megathrust (e.g., from 50 MPa to 10 MPa) or (2) a partial stress drop of a very weak megathrust (e.g., from 15 MPa to 10 MPa). Option 1 appears to be consistent with dramatic dynamic weakening observed in high-slip-rate rock friction experiments. Option 2 is consistent with seismological observations that large earthquakes are characterized by low average stress drop values. In this work, we demonstrate that the second option is correct. We show that a weak fault, represented by an apparent coefficient of friction of ~0.03 can put the Japan Trench forearc into margin-normal compression, and lowering this value by ~0.01 can switch the forearc into tension. For the Tohoku earthquake, we determine an average stress drop value from each of the 20 published coseismic slip distributions models that were constrained by seismic, geodetic, and tsunami data. Our results reconcile seismic observations that average stress drops for large megathrust events are quite low with laboratory work on high-rate weakening which predicts very high or complete stress drop. We find that, in all the rupture models, regions of high stress drop (20 – 80 MPa) corresponding to high-rate weakening can occur, but are surrounded by regions of stress increase, so that the average stress drop remains low (< 5 MPa). The very low average stress drop during the Tohoku earthquake, consistent with values reported for other large earthquakes, makes it unambiguous that the Japan Trench megathrust is very weak. Investigating the heterogeneity of coseismic stress change also helps us understand rupture mechanics of the megathrust.",

            "abstract": "Infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) is a technique typically used on potassium feldspar grains for dating sediment deposition. However, the apparent age of a deposit is not the only valuable piece of information a grain can provide. Recent developments in IRSL protocols, such as post-IR IRSL measurements (pIRIR) and the Super-K grain separation method, have shed new light on the mineralogic controls on luminescence behavior for both alkali and plagioclase feldspars. Preliminary results indicate that characteristics such as pIRIR brightness and change of decay shape with preheat temperature are correlated to relative abundance of Ca-Na-K, minor and trace elemental composition, degree of Al-Si order, and microstructures such as exsolution lamellae. The effects of weathering on luminescence behavior is also considered. Using this information, we investigate the feasibility of comparing IRSL responses of sediments to potential sources to identify the parent rock. While this study focuses on deposits derived from extant igneous and metamorphic bodies, future investigations will expand upon this research to include reworked sediments. Coupled with concurrent studies in using partial bleaching to identify multiple depositional episodes, this research brings us closer to understanding the provenance of a single grain.",

            "abstract": "One of the key goals of the Van Allen Probes mission is to understand the acceleration of the core radiation belt electron population (electrons with energy > 1 MeV). One important piece of this acceleration process are the 100's of keV seed electrons that originate as lower energy electrons in the plasma sheet, are transported into the inner magnetosphere and can be then be accelerated via wave-particle interactions to higher energies. The instrumentation of the Van Allen Probes mission offers an opportunity to make clear, simultaneous observations of both the seed and core populations in the heart of the radiation belts. These observations will allow us to better understand the role the seed population plays in the acceleration process and quantify the acceleration timescales. Here, we calculate phase space density (PSD) for nearly 18 months of observations from both the Magnetic Electron Ion Spectrometer (MagEIS) and Relativistic Electron Proton Telescope (REPT) instruments. Looking at fixed second invariant K and third invariant L* we examine how the electron PSD evolves for different values of first invariant μ (or equivalently energy). We are then able to clearly identify enhancements in the seed and core populations. For all the events in this 18 month time period, we quantify how well correlated enhancements to the core population are to enhancements to the seed population and what the acceleration timescales are as a function of energy.",

Most IODP expeditions sail dedicated education officers to lead outreach efforts, including live ship-to-shore video events. Expeditions conduct 30-90 events through close collaboration between the educators and science party members. In 2014, Expedition 349 collected cores in the South China Sea. Even though no educator sailed, the staff scientist filled this role, allowing the expedition to carry out an extensive program of 58 live events (led by scientists) with institutions in 13 countries, demonstrating that outreach is deeply engrained in IODP culture. Expedition 349 spoke to ~3700 people, including ~375 primary school students in China and the USA, ~1150 secondary school students in six countries, and ~1300 undergraduate and graduate students in seven countries. The scientists also conducted events with museums, science centers, and science conferences.\nOver the last six years of operations, we have gained significant insights that help us to capitalize on best practices and utilize the newest and most effective technology for live events from sea given bandwidth constraints. We currently conduct video events with an iPad using Zoom software. Educators and scientists work together to provide ship tours and educate audiences about expedition science, lab work, and life at sea, and also answer audience questions. One feature we use extensively is the ability to screen share with Zoom, which allows us to show images stored on the iPad. These images show the location of drill sites and provide background information about the expedition scientific objectives, the drilling and coring process, and more. Shipboard scientists are usually enthusiastic about outreach events and many contact friends and colleagues to schedule additional events. The audiences we connect with ask many great questions and often post photos and YouTube videos of the events to social media. In addition, we conduct surveys following each event to help us improve our outreach program. We apply these results to future expeditions, including Expedition 353 (Indian Monsoon), which will be at sea during AGU, giving us the opportunity to demonstrate our ship-to-shore capabilities.",

These experiences have been shown to help students learn content and skills, promote students' cognitive and affective development, and develop students' sense of self. Early exposure to research experiences has shown to be effective in the recruitment of students, improved retention and persistence in degree programs, motivation for students to learn and increase self-efficacy, improved attitudes and values about science, and overall increased student success. Just as departments at four-year institutions (4YCs) are increasingly integrating research into their introductory courses, two-year college (2YC) geoscience faculty have a great opportunity to ground their students in authentic research. The Undergraduate Research with Two-year College Students website developed by SAGE 2YC: Supporting and Advancing Geoscience Education at Two-year Colleges provides ideas and advice for 2YC and 4YC faculty who want to get more 2YC students involved in research.\nThe continuum of possibilities for faculty to explore includes things that can be done at 2YCs (eg. doing research as part of a regular course, developing a course specifically around research on a particular topic, or independent study), done in collaboration with other local institutions (eg. using their facilities, conducting joint class research, or using research to support transfer programs), and by involving students in the kind of organized Undergraduate Research programs run by a number of institutions and organizations. The website includes profiles illustrating how 2YC geoscience faculty have tackled these various models of research and addressed potential challenges such as lack of time, space, and funding as part of supporting the wide diversity of students that attend 2YCs, most of whom have less experience than that of rising seniors who are the traditional REU participant. The website also provides resources on effective strategies for developing REU programs for community college students, examples of successful multi-year programs, links to other projects working on undergraduate research in the first two years, and references for further reading.\nserc.carleton.edu/sage2yc/studentsuccess/ug-research/",

Intact tropical forests may contribute a substantial fraction of this. While current estimates are based on data from forest inventory plots, these plot studies have been criticized for failure to represent landscape scale processes especially the frequency of severe natural disturbances. Here we characterize the frequency distribution of disturbance events in natural forests from 0.01 ha to 2,651 ha size throughout Amazonia using a novel combination of forest inventory, airborne lidar and satellite remote sensing data. We find that small-scale mortality events are responsible for aboveground biomass losses of about 88.3% over the entire Amazon region. We also find that intermediate-scale disturbances account for losses around 12.7%, and that the largest-scale disturbances as a result of blow-downs only accounts for losses of around 0.02%. Stochastic simulation of growth and mortality based on data from the forest plot census network and the region-wide disturbance spectrum together indicate that rare large disturbances are outweighed by the net biomass gains measured, supporting the inference of a substantial carbon sink in old-growth Amazon forests.",

            "abstract": "The thermosphere exhibits pronounced annual and semi-annual cycles in neutral density, with the equinoxes higher than the solstices, and the December solstice higher than June. The electron density of the F-region ionosphere shows the same pattern, and it has long been presumed that these are linked. The underlying cause of this pattern is likely the variation of atomic/molecular neutral composition. This composition variation has long been observed through space-based in-situ and remote-sensing measurements, from Atmosphere Explorer to TIMED, and is captured by empirical models such as the MSIS series. However, the cause of the composition variation is not known. Various mechanisms have been proposed, including changes the general circulation of the thermosphere, the varying Sun-Earth distance, the inclination of the geomagnetic field, and atmospheric tidal and wave forcing. Hemispherical differences in atmospheric circulation, particularly at the solstices, and their interaction with the thermosphere through changes mesopause dynamics and turbopause mixing, are a prime candidate. In this paper, we present observational evidence demonstrating the linkage between seasonal/hemispheric changes in neutral density, ion density, and composition, and model simulations describing the interaction of seasonal variation in the lower atmosphere with the thermosphere/ionosphere system.",

            "abstract": "Sea ice in the Arctic is experiencing declines that are projected to result in a purely seasonal ice cover regime in the 22nd century. In regions of sea ice loss, this will lead to a local changes in the sensible and latent heat flux from the ocean to the atmosphere. Subsequent impacts on mid-latitude weather and climate may occur, for example through changes in air mass generation and properties, mass fields, and jet stream dynamics. The goal of this research is to examine the remote influences of sea ice loss on the atmosphere, with particular focus on loss in the western Arctic. Many studies have been conducted using atmospheric component models forced with specified (reduced) sea ice concentration and sea surface temperatures. These studies have the advantage of clearly separating the signal of sea ice loss from other changes in the climate system, however the experimental configuration neglects the inclusion of atmosphere-ocean feedbacks. The approach used in this study is to employ simulations of future climate using a fully coupled global climate model (GCM) from the Climate Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) and applies a self organizing maps technique to identify spatial and temporal patterns in air masses, mass fields and sea ice concentration. Relationships between the atmospheric self organizing map patterns and sea ice concentrations in the model are used to identify dynamical links between sea ice loss and atmospheric variability in the context of a fully coupled model. Causes of inter-annual variability in western Arctic winter sea ice are investigated, as they pertain to a potential mechanism for predictability of this atmosphere-ocean-sea ice interaction and it's impacts over North America.",

            "abstract": "Methane (CH4) is the third most important greenhouse gas after H2O and CO2. The effects of global warming on wetland hydrology have a strong impact on wetland CH4 production and emission, via both hydrologic and biogeochemical processes, presenting a challenge to accurate projection of CH4 responses to climate change. We are working on the development of CH4 module—including CH4 production, consumption and transport processes— in the Community Land Model (CLM4.5) in order to estimate CH4 fluxes in a regional and global scale. However, high uncertainties are still present in sensitivity of CH4 production to soil temperature, hydrology, pH and redox potential, rough treatment to vertical soil resolution and fractional inundation, and simplified parameterizing of CH4 transport and emissions. Our research aims to (1) use tower eddy covariance and aircraft measurements of CH4 concentration and surface flux to test the CH4 processes in CLM model; (2) obtain a better understanding and parameterization of the biogeochemical and biogeophysical processes of high latitude wetland CH4 production and emission; (3) assess impact of climate variability on wetland CH4 emission. Our analysis of CLM shows that the modeled predictions of the seasonal cycle of CH4 in high latitude wetlands is very sensitive to active layer hydrological cycle. The abrupt soil water increase in the period of soil thawing and snow melting leads to unrealistically large emissions of CH4 during the spring season. We present improvements required to generate realistic seasonal cycles of high latitude CH4 fluxes in the model.",

            "abstract": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) gas is among the major contributors to global warming and ozone depletion in stratosphere. Quantitative estimate of N­2O production in various pathways and N­2O fluxes across different reservoirs is the key to understanding the role of N­2O in the global change. To achieve this goal, accurate and concurrent measurement of both N2O concentration ([N2O]) and its site-specific isotopic composition (SP-δ15N), namely δ15Nα and δ15Nβ, is desired. Recent developments in Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) have enabled high precision measurements of [N2O] and SP-δ15N of a continuous gas flow. However, many N­­2O samples are discrete with limited volume (< 500 ml), and/or high [N2O] (> 2 ppm), and are not suitable for direct measurements by CRDS. Here we present results of a Small Sample Isotope Module 2 (SSIM2) which is coupled to and automatically coordinated with a Picarro isotopic N2O CRDS analyzer to handle and measure high concentration and/or small volume samples. The SSIM2 requires 20 ml of sample per analysis, and transfers the sample to the CRDS for high precision measurement. When the sample injection is < 20 ml, a zero gas is optionally filled to make up the volume. We used the SSIM2 to dilute high [N2O] samples and < 20 ml samples, and tested the effect of dilution on the measured SP-δ15N. In addition, we employed and tested a newly developed double injection method for samples adequate for two 20 ml injections. After the SSIM2 and the CRDS cavity was primed with the first injection, the second injection, which has negligible dilution of the sample, can be accurately measured for both [N2O] and SP-δ15N. Results of these experiments indicate that the precision of SSIM2-CRDS is similar to that of the continuous measurements using the CRDS alone, and that dilution has minimal effect on SP-δ15N, as along as the [N2O] is > 300 ppb after dilution. Overall, the precision of SP-δ15N measured using the SSIM2 is < 0.5 ‰.",

            "abstract": "Microbes drive processes in the Earth system far exceeding their physical scale, affecting crop yields, water quality, the mobilization of toxic materials, and fundamental aspects of soil biogeochemistry. The tools of synthetic biology have the potential to significantly improve our understanding of microbial Earth system processes: for example, synthetic microbes can be be programmed to report on environmental conditions that stimulate greenhouse gas production, metal oxidation, biofilm formation, pollutant degradation, and microbe-plant symbioses. However, these tools are only rarely deployed in the lab. This research gap arises because synthetically programmed microbes typically report on their environment by producing molecules that are detected optically (e.g., fluorescent proteins). Fluorescent reporters are ideal for petri-dish applications and have fundamentally changed how we study human health, but their usefulness is quite limited in soils where detecting fluorescence is challenging.\nHere we describe the construction of gas-reporting biosensors, which release nonpolar gases that can be detected in the headspace of incubation experiments. These constructs can be used to probe microbial processes within soils in real-time noninvasive lab experiments. These biosensors can be combined with traditional omics-based approaches to reveal processes controlling soil microbial behavior and lead to improved environmental management decisions.",

Previous research has shown that sediment erodibility is affected by biofilm concentration and that growth of benthic organisms, which produce biofilm, is affected by nutrient enrichment. However, researchers have not examined possible links between nutrient addition and sediment erodibility. We manipulated nutrient levels in the water column of 16 microcosms filled with homogenized sediment from a shallow coastal lagoon and artificial seawater to determine the effects on biofilm growth, measured through chlorophyll a and colloidal carbohydrate concentrations. Erosion tests using a Gust microcosm were conducted to determine the relationship between sediment erodibility and biofilm concentration. Results show that carbohydrate levels decreased with increasing nutrient enrichment and were unrelated to chlorophyll concentrations and erodibility. The nutrient levels did not predictably affect the chlorophyll levels, with lower chlorophyll concentrations in the control and medium enrichment treatments than the low and high enrichment treatments. Controls on biofilm growth are still unclear and the assumed relationship between carbohydrates and erodibility may be invalid. Understanding how biofilms respond to nutrient enrichment and subsequent effects on sediment erodibility is essential for protecting and restoring shallow coastal systems.",

            "abstract": "Soil and plant surfaces emit ice nucleating particles (INP) to the atmosphere, especially when disturbed by wind, harvesting, rain or fire. Organic (biogenic) INP are abundant in most soils and dominate the population that nucleate >-15°C. For example, the sandy topsoil of sagebrush shrubland, a widespread ecotype prone to wind erosion after fire, contains ~106 organic INP g-1 at -6°C. The relevance of organic INP may also extend to colder temperatures than previously thought: Particles of soil organic matter (SOM) have been shown to be more important than mineral particles for the ice nucleating ability of agricultural soil dusts to -34°C. While the abundance of ice nucleation active (INA) bacteria on plants has been established, the identity of the organic INP in and emitted by soils remains a 40-year-old mystery. The need to understand their production and release is highlighted by recent findings that INA bacteria (measured with qPCR) account for few, if any, of the warm-temperature organic INP that predominate in boundary layer aerosols and snow; organic INP lofted with soil dusts seem a likely source. The complexity of SOM hinders its investigation. It contains decomposing plant materials, a diverse microbial and microfaunal community, humus, and inert organic matter. All are biochemically complex and all may contain ice nucleating constituents, either by design or by chance. Indeed the smoothness of the INP temperature spectra of soils is indicative of numerous, overlapping distributions of INP. We report recent progress in identifying and quantifying the organic INP in soils and boundary layer aerosols representative of West Central U.S. ecosystems, and how their characteristics may affect their dispersal. Chemical, enzymatic and DNA-based tests were used to assess contributions of INP from plant tissues, INA bacteria, INA fungi, organic crystals, monolayers of aliphatic alcohols, carbohydrates, and humic substances, while heat- and peroxide-based tests were used to estimate total organic INP abundance.",

            "abstract": "Late summer streamflow for the Scott River in northern California has decreased approximately 50% since the mid 1960’s, resulting in increased water temperatures and disconnection of certain portions of the stream which negatively impacts aquatic habitat of fish species such as coho and fall-run Chinook salmon. In collaboration with local stakeholders, the Scott Valley Integrated Hydrologic Model has been developed, which combines a water budget model and a groundwater-surface water model (MODLFOW) of the 200 km2 basin. The goal of the integrated model is to better understand the hydrologic system of the valley and explore effects of different groundwater management scenarios on late summer streamflow. The groundwater model has a quarter-hectare resolution with aggregated monthly stress periods over a 21 year period (1990-2011). The Scott River is represented using either the river (RIV) or streamflow routing (SFR) package. UCODE was used for sensitivity analysis and calibration using head observations for 52 wells in the basin and gain/loss observations for two sections of the river. Of 32 model parameters (hydraulic conductivity, specific storage, riverbed conductance and mountain recharge), 13 were found significantly sensitive to observations. Results from the calibration show excellent agreement between modeled and observed heads and to seasonal and interannual variations in streamflow. The calibrated model was used to evaluate several management scenarios: 1) alternative water budget which takes into account measured irrigation rates in the valley, 2) in-lieu recharge where surface-water instead of groundwater is used to irrigate fields near the river while streamflow is sufficiently high, and 3) managed recharge on agricultural fields in gulches on the eastern side of the valley in the winter months. Preliminary results indicate that alternative water management scenarios (in-lieu and managed recharge) significantly increase late summer streamflow by keeping groundwater levels near the stream higher, and the stream gaining longer into the dry summer period.",

            "abstract": "North Carolina and Florida are likely the only two states on the US east coast that have practical access to energy extraction from the Gulf Stream. After leaving the Florida Straits, the Gulf Stream in the region offshore of Cape Hatteras, NC exhibits the least variability in position of any location on the east coast, while simultaneously being closest to land. These important characteristics have made this area the focus of observations to quantify the hydrokinetic energy that may be available from the Gulf Stream for the state of North Carolina. Three types of observations to quantify the energy resource off NC began in 2013. A 150 kHz Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) was moored on the 225 meter isobath at the location estimated to be best for energy extraction, and recovered after a 9-month continuous deployment. Another ADCP was moored in nearly the same location to continue observations, and will be retrieved this fall. Currents from the first deployment averaged 1.15 m/s, and the average Betz Power was 0.8 kW/m2 at a depth of 30 meters over the 9-month duration. Significant variability in current speed, and thus power, occurred over the deployment period. Additionally, current measurements from a vessel mounted 300 kHz ADCP were made from water depths of 100m to 1000 m on a cross-isobath transect that included the location of the ADCP mooring. Currents from the ship transects are still under evaluation and comparison with the 150 kHz ADCP mooring, and will provide valuable information about the spatial variability of the current and its dependence on depth. A coastal ocean radar was added to an existing radar network to provide hourly surface current measurements over the larger study area. Methods to use the relative vorticity in the surface currents to identify the shoreward front of the Gulf Stream are being developed and compared with existing frontal determinations such as Navy Gulf Stream frontal charts produced bi-daily. Frontal estimates are being used to determine the location of the Gulf Stream cyclonic shear zone during ADCP current measurements. Favorable comparisons between the three current observations will provide confidence that the available Betz power can be extrapolated from the radar surface currents alone over long time periods when ADCP information may not be available.",

The volcanism in the area is associated with tectonic extension over the last 500 ka, followed by subsidence and sedimentation at the surface level and dike emplacement in the lower crust. Although significant progress has been made describing the tectonic evolution and petrology of the erupted products of the Salton Buttes, their coupled control on the crustal heat transfer and feedback on the melt evolution remain unclear. To address these concepts, we develop a two-dimensional finite volume model and investigate the compositional and thermal evolution of the melt and crust in the Salton Sea Geothermal Field through a one-way coupled thermal model that accounts for tectonic extension, lower crustal magma emplacement, sedimentation, and subsidence. Through our simulations, we give quantitative estimates to the thermal and compositional evolution and longevity of the lower crustal melt source in the crustal section. We further compare the model results with petrologic constraints. Our thermal balance equations show that crustal melting is limited and the melt is dominated by mantle-derived material. Similarly, petrologic work on δ18O isotope ratios suggests fractional crystallization of basalt with minor crustal assimilation. In addition, we suggest scenarios for the melt fraction, composition, enthalpy release, geometry and depth of magma reservoirs, their temporal evolution, and the timescales of magmatic storage and evolution processes. These parameters provide the source conditions for the dynamics of surface volcanism and the presence of a geothermal system, which modify the thermal and mechanical structure of the crust.",

            "abstract": "Semiarid rangelands have a high level of both spatial and temporal vegetation heterogeneity due to slow net primary production rates and highly variable rainfall. Ecohydrological modeling in these ecosystems requires high resolution inputs of vegetation structure and function. We used the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) to create eight synthetic Landsat TM images across a growing season (April - September). STARFM fuses the high spatial resolution of Landsat TM with the high temporal resolution of Terra MODIS. Previous attempts to assess the accuracy and quantify model errors of STARFM have used pixel-based regression and difference image analysis, as well as examining the distribution of those errors across land cover types. However, those model errors have not previously been compared to a null model (i.e., using the nearest available Landsat scene). If there is very little change occurring, then you would expect the model to have artificially high correlation coefficients and low error estimates. Additionally, we examined several other potential sources of error: i) time of year or season, ii) vegetation height class from airborne LiDAR, iii) solar radiation (i.e., aspect), and iv) snow. We found that STARFM added new information when compared to the null model, yet the null model was highly accurate during large parts of the growing season (June through September, r2 = 0.95 - 0.97) suggesting that simply reporting r2 values from pixel-based regression is insufficient to assess model accuracy. We found that areas with snow in the preceding model input imagery (NDSI > 0.4) increased errors threefold (RMSE(snow) = 0.3223, RMSE(not-snow) = 0.1017). We also found that pixels with shrub or tree vegetation (height > 0.3 m) tended to have higher errors when compared to ground or grass pixels. Finally, our results indicate that during the middle of the growing season, there are patterns in the error that relate to solar radiation with the NDVI of tree and grass pixels being underestimated on south-facing slopes and overestimated on north-facing slopes. Shrub pixels show a more consistent overestimation of NDVI.",

            "abstract": "Non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), including the standing dead leaves and trunks of plants, is not only a crucial component of aboveground biomass in the dry ecosystems but also an effective indicator of drought, since the photosynthetic plants (PV) usually degrade to NPV after drought. With the multiple-endmember spectral mixture (MESMA) analysis, it is possible to extract the NPV coverage to a selected baseline date from MODIS MOD43 NBAR data. In this study, we used a baseline image derived based on JHU Spectral Library to obtain the NPV, PV and bare soil of southwest U.S. from 2000 to 2012. To investigate the response of NPV, we then calculated the lagged and non-lagged correlation between the anomalies of land cover and climate variables. The major land use categories are also employed to investigate the spatial pattern of the response. \nThe more significant correlation between NPV or PV and precipitation than temperature indicates the importance of moisture in the study site. In addition, there is an asymmetric response between NPV to the drought and the increased precipitation. In drier inland, the most significant response of NPV after a deficit of precipitation occurs later than after an increase. The increase of temperature, especially under the deficits of moisture, facilitates the presence of NPV with lag, which is due to the response time of detectable withering of PV. The response of NPV also varies between the different land cover categories. In southwest U.S., the NPV from shrubs and grassland have more sensitive feedbacks on the dynamics of climate than wetter region. The nature of the ecosystems can partly explain the difference, but finer scale studies are necessary for further investigation of specific regions. \nConsidering the increase of drought in southwest U.S., obtaining a better understanding on the response of vegetation is crucial to further evaluate its impacts on the dry ecosystems. This study provides a perspective by examining NPV, another direct indicator of drought. For further studies, temporal and spatial patterns of NPV response to the climate need more scrutiny, such as the spatial pattern of the lags, hotspots of change, and regional-specific feedbacks. Different indicators of extreme events, such as the U.S. Drought Monitor may also be employed to provide more direct evaluation.",

            "abstract": "The stressing conditions on faults continuously evolve due to several factors, such as tectonic stressing, fault interactions, pore-fluid perturbations, and viscoelastic relaxation. Initial stressing conditions have a profound effect on the rupture process, including rupture propagation through stepover regions. Knowledge of rupture behavior near fault stepovers is critically important to properly quantify and mitigate seismic hazards. Previous studies have shown that stepovers along faults can influence both the earthquake magnitude and recurrence interval when rupture either jumps across or is arrested at a stepover. Landmark investigations of en echelon fault interaction with uniform initial stresses that promote super-shear rupture reported successful jumps occur at step-over widths ≤ 2.5 and 5 km for compressional and extensional stepovers, respectively (Harris and Day, 1993).\nWe use the 3D quasi-dynamic, physics-based simulator RSQSim to investigate how stress evolution effects rupture propagation at fault stepovers over multiple earthquake cycles. Comparisons of single-event ruptures at fault stepovers between RSQSim and the dynamic finite element code FaultMod demonstrate nucleation locations on the receiver fault similar to those of Harris and Day (1993). These simulations use uniform initial stresses with rate- and state- and slip-weakening dependent friction for RSQSim and FaultMod, respectively. Here, we present results from multi-cycle event simulations on en echelon faults using evolved stress states that arise due to fault interaction and tectonic loading. Results indicate that successful rupture jumps only occur at stepover widths of 1-1.5 km for both fault step types. The spatial pattern of rupture re-nucleation locations is strongly influenced by the evolved stress state and is dissimilar to the pattern predicted by studies. Finally, initial rupture nucleation always occurs before the magnitude of the pre-stress reaches values high enough to cause super-shear rupture, due to the heterogeneity of stress and the rate- and state- frictional properties. These results suggest that mechanisms such as extreme weakening may play a larger role than initial stress on supershear ruptures, and that observations of rupture jumps > 1 km may be explained by fault connection at depth.",

            "abstract": "Simulation of anthropogenically induced land cover change impacts on climate has made significant progress over the last half century, starting with impacts of albedo and land cover change and evolving to include irrigation, urbanization and wood harvest carbon cycle impacts. However, many models still simulate these processes piece meal and the historical and Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) derived datasets used to drive these processes are not necessarily internally consistent in their implementation within Earth System Models. A further important question considers how anthropogenically driven feedbacks in the LULC-climate system will take place. In the future land cover change may be small given the lack of available arable land. However, land use intensification and political actions on energy consumption in urban systems may result in significant new indirect impacts on nutrient cycles and biogeophysical and biogeochemical processes.\nThis paper will review some of the land cover and land use (LCLU) processes simulated in ESMs and a review the sources of information used to define the geographical extent of LULC changes. One question to address is whether the current representation of these processes are adequate to simulate the totality of the anthropogenic climate impacts, given that in many cases there are differences in the intensity of land uses over space and time, and that a particular land cover class may actually encompass a wide variety of human activities. There also remain some land cover types/processes that are not well simulated in most models. For example the ill-defined land use class associated with pasture or grazing activities. Finally, it is important to consider which land cover types are most likely to change in the future. Perhaps more important than the spatial change is how processes within land cover types will change. For example, urban systems are likely to play a major role in determining LULC related influences on anthropogenic energy consumption and emissions. Any changes to how urban systems develop in the future will impact energy demand and constitute a human feedback, however, it potentially also impacts other land cover types. These processes need to be adequately linked in our simulations to ensure that we develop internally consistent scenario projections.",

Note from Webster, a tool is a device for doing work; it makes outcomes more realizable and more cost effective, and, in a word, better.\nPrior to the existence of CSCs, the university and federal scientific world certainly contained a large “set” of scientists with considerable strength in the physical, biological, natural, and social sciences to address the complexities and interdisciplinary nature of the challenges in the areas of climate variability, change, impacts, and adaptation. However, this set of scientists were hardly an integrated community let alone a focused team, but rather a collection of distinguished researchers, educators, and practitioners that were working with disparate though at times linked objectives, and they were rarely aligning themselves formally to an overarching strategic pathway. In addition, data, models, research results, tools, and products were generally somewhat “disconnected” from the broad range of stakeholders. I should note also that NOAA's Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments ( RISA) program is an earlier “Existence Theorem” for a Federal–University Partnership to Develop Actionable and Needs-Driven Science Agendas.\nThis contribution will discuss the important cultural shift that has flowed from Secretarial Order 3289.",

This geometry is directly relevant to the magnetic field mapping between different regions of near-Earth space.\nOne method to evaluate the instantaneous geomagnetic field configuration is by probing the isotropic boundaries (IB) of energetic particles measured at low altitudes. Those are interpreted as the boundary between the regions of adiabatic and stochastic particle motion in the equatorial magnetotail and used as a proxy for the degree of magnetic field stretching.\nWe investigate the topology and dynamics of the magnetotail current during active and quiet times as dependent on solar wind and IMF parameters based on NOAA/POES MEPED and DMSP SSJ/4 measurements in combination with global magnetospheric simulations using the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF). The extensive NOAA/POES MEPED low-altitude data sets give the locations of isotropic boundaries, which are used to extract information regarding particle distributions and field structure in the source regions in the magnetosphere.\nThis study presents a comparison between the magnetic field lines with the observed IB latitude and those computed from the SWMF using the theoretical relation for IB locations in the magnetotail, i.e. where the ratio between curvature radius and Larmor radius is close to 8. This investigation assesses the accuracy of the model magnetic field and the structure of the magnetotail. The results are examined in relation to the solar wind and IMF conditions to determine the corresponding configuration and dynamics of the magnetotail.",

It has been suggested that fast dispersive waves are responsible for the fast timescales of reconnection in both the high-β and low-β regimes. Here we show from two-fluid simulations that low-β reconnection is fast in cases with and without such waves. To understand this, we construct a quantitative model of the dissipation region (DR) and benchmark it against the fluid simulations. We find that the DR self-adjusts to give a rate that is independent of DR physics in both cases, and in good agreement with kinetic results.

The importance of stream-aquifer connectivity is evidenced by its influence in the hydrologic response and in the fate and transport of solutes at the watershed scale. To better understand the dynamics of stream-aquifer connectivity and the effects that intra-annual weather variability has on physical and chemical processes, a monitoring network was installed at a meander bend of the East Fork of the Jemez River in the Valles Caldera National Preserve (VCNP), a snow-dominated watershed in northern New Mexico. This work summarizes four years of observations of groundwater-surface water interaction. Spatio-temporal patterns of water level, temperature, and electrical conductivity were measured in meander-bend wells and vertical fluxes to/from the stream were estimated using in-stream piezometers, subsurface thermal records, and distributed temperature sensing in the channel. A three-dimensional numerical model was used to synthesize data and draw general conclusions. The observational network has been collecting data since the summer of 2010 to present, overlapping the Las Conchas fire in the VCNP (largest wildfire on record in New Mexico’s history), and therefore representing a valuable data set to evaluate the hydrological and biogeochemical implications of wildfire events.",

Apache OCW provides scientists and developers with tools for data manipulation, metrics for dataset comparisons, and a visualization suite. In addition to a powerful low-level API, Apache OCW also supports a web application for quick, browser-controlled evaluations, a command line application for local evaluations, and a virtual machine for isolated experimentation with minimal setup. This talk will look at the difficulties and successes of moving a closed community research project out into the wild world of open source.

The model describes the equatorial currents with a basis-function expansion approach, instead of custom-tailored current systems, allowing the equatorial currents to be inferred directly from data. This magnetometer data was binned using global storm parameters, allowing it to model the storm-time evolution of the magnetosphere during the March 2013 geomagnetic storm. It reconstructs the symmetric and asymmetric ring currents, including a westward ring current at R > 4 RE and a eastward ring current at R < 3 RE. The ring current is highly asymmetric during the main phase of the storm and returns to a symmetric ring current during the recovery phase. Other findings include a westward rotation and of the Region-2 ring current system during the main phase of the storm and a closed banana current in the inner-magenteosphere closing through asymmetries in the westward and eastward ring current system, both of which are consistent with first-principles kinetic models.",

            "abstract": "Geologic sequestration of CO2 in deep sedimentary formations is a promising means of mitigating carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants but the long-term fate of injected CO2 is challenging to predict. Reactive transport models are used to gain insight over long times but rely on laboratory determined mineral reaction rates that have been difficult to extrapolate to field systems. This, in part, is due to a lack of understanding of mineral reactive surface area. Many models use an arbitrary approximation of reactive surface area, applying orders of magnitude scaling factors to measured BET or geometric surface areas. Recently, a few more sophisticated approaches have used 2D and 3D image analyses to determine mineral-specific reactive surface areas that account for the accessibility of minerals. However, the ability of these advanced surface area estimates to improve predictions of mineral reaction rates has yet to be determined. In this study, we fuse X-ray microCT, SEM QEMSCAN, XRD, SANS, and SEM-FIB analysis to determine mineral-specific accessible reactive surface areas for a core sample from the Nagaoka pilot CO2 injection site (Japan). This sample is primarily quartz, plagioclase, smectite, K-feldspar, and pyroxene. SEM imaging shows abundant smectite cement and grain coatings that decrease the fluid accessibility of other minerals. However, analysis of FIB-SEM images reveals that smectite nano-pores are well connected such that access to underlying minerals is not occluded by smectite coatings. Mineral-specific accessible surfaces are determined, accounting for the connectivity of the pore space with and without connected smectite nano-pores. The large-scale impact of variations in accessibility and dissolution rates are then determined through continuum scale modeling using grid-cell specific information on accessible surface areas. This approach will be compared with a traditional continuum scale model using mineral abundances and common surface area estimates. Ultimately, the effectiveness of advanced surface area characterization to improve mineral dissolution rates will be evaluated by comparison of model results with dissolution rates measured from a flow-through column experiment.",

            "abstract": "Aerosols have the capability to alter regional-scale atmospheric circulations. A better understanding of the contribution of aerosols to multi-scale atmospheric phenomena and their transient changes is crucial for efforts to evaluate climate predictions using next generation climate models. In this study we address the following questions: (1) Is there a mechanistic relationship between variability of oceanic dust aerosol forcing and transient changes in the African easterly jet- African easterly wave (AEJ-AEW) system? (2) What are the long-term impacts of possible aerosol-wave interactions on climate dynamics of eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean and western African monsoon (WAM) region during boreal summer seasons? Our hypothesis is that aerosol radiative forcing may act as additional energy source to fuel the development of African easterly waves on the northern and southern sides of the AEJ. Evidence in support of this hypothesis is presented based on analysis of an ensemble of NASA satellite data sets, including aerosol optical thickness (AOT) observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) and the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS), as well as an atmospheric reanalysis from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) and a simulation of global aerosol distributions made with the Goddard Earth Observing System Model version 5 (GEOS-5) Earth system model with meteorology constrained by MERRA and an assimilation of MODIS AOT (MERRAero). We propose that the impacts of Saharan aerosols on the regional climate dynamics occur through contributions to the eddy energy of waves with 2—7-day and 7—11-day variability.",

While there is a growing educational and hobbyist community engaged in the STEM focused technical and intellectual challenges associated with 3D printing, there is unrealized potential for the earth science community to use 3D printing to communicate scientific research to the public. Moreover, 3D printing offers scientists the opportunity to connect students and the public with novel visualizations of real data. As opposed to introducing terrestrial measurements through the use of colormaps and gradients, scientists can represent 3D concepts with 3D models, offering a more intuitive education tool. Furthermore, the tactile aspect of models make geophysical concepts accessible to a wide range of learning styles like kinesthetic or tactile, and learners including both visually impaired and color-blind students.\nWe present a workflow whereby scientists, students, and the general public will be able to 3D print their own versions of geophysical datasets, even adding time through layering to include a 4th dimension, for a “4D” print. This will enable scientists with unique and expert insights into the data to easily create the tools they need to communicate their research. It will allow educators to quickly produce teaching aids for their students. Most importantly, it will enable the students themselves to translate the 2D representation of geophysical data into a 3D representation of that same data, reinforcing spatial reasoning.",

With varying range to the planet during the spacecraft’s elliptical, near polar orbit, VMC obtains views of the day side southern hemisphere ( ~ 72,500 km) and the limb when it is furthest away from the planet, and can see a fraction of the planet’s sun-lit limb northern latitudes when the spacecraft is closer to the planet ( >~ 25,000 km). We use these images to look at the temporal behavior of the normalized intensity and unit slant optical depth (location of the bright limb) at four wavelengths during April 2006 – March 2014. We detect correlated changes in the normalized brightness and the altitude of the unit optical depth over this period.\nImages were normalized using Minnaert function to account for the varying scattering geometry in order to detect changes in the reflectivity of the cloud cover at selected locations in local solar time. The unit optical depth was determined from the location of the planet's bright limb, taken to be where the brightness gradient is maximum along the bright limb azimuth. The changes observed appear to be quasi periodic.\n",

            "abstract": "Wind-driven movement of flexible vegetation has been an overlooked mechanism in wetland gas models. To understand the magnitude of this effect, a laboratory experiment was conducted. An array of plastic tubes, representing vegetation, was mechanically forced at a range of frequencies and amplitudes matching those observed in the field. Starting from deoxygenated water, we measured dissolved oxygen at mid-depth in the water column using a YSI ProODO as the water re-equilibrated with the atmosphere. From this DO timeseries, we calculated the gas transfer velocity, k, using the thin film gas transport model. This measurement of k was independent of the water-wall interactions, which can be significant in laboratory-scale tanks. Our experiments have shown that the movement of vegetation stirs the water column and thus contributes to the transfer of dissolved gases across the air-water interface. Increased transfer was observed with movements of higher frequency and amplitude. To estimate the occurrence of this phenomena in natural systems, data (e.g. velocity profiles) from a long-term monitoring project in the Florida Everglades will be analyzed. The results can help improve current gas budgets and predict biogeochemical processes.",

            "abstract": "The ability to couple rutile crystallization temperatures using the Zr-in-rutile thermometer with U-Pb age data makes this mineral an outstanding ‘petrochronometer’. However, the relatively low closure temperature of Pb diffusion in rutile (~450°C) compared with the high closure temperature for Zr diffusion suggests we should see a decoupling of these systems. This talk will present two examples from high- to ultrahigh-temperature (HT/UHT) metamorphic terranes in which the timing of rutile crystallization recorded by Zr thermometry is decoupled from cooling ages recorded by U-Pb geochronology.\nIn example 1, from the Gruf Complex of the European Central Alps, rutile grains in different metapelitic assemblages preserve Zr-in-rutile temperatures indicating prograde metamorphic growth (500-880°C from inclusions in garnet), growth during garnet-breakdown to Spr + Opx ± Crd at UHT conditions (>900°C), and subsequent growth during a lower granulite facies overprint during exhumation (~750°C). This cycle of growth is interpreted to have occurred during a single P-T loop between >35 Ma and ~30 Ma. However, the U-Pb system in rutile only preserves evidence for cooling through Pb-closure at ~21-24 Ma, indicating cooling rates above 30°C/m.y. during assembly of the Gruf Complex geological units and partial exhumation.\nIn example 2, from the Rayner Complex of the East Antarctic Shield, rutile grains in metasedimentary rocks occur in textural equilibrium with HT-UHT metamorphic assemblages formed at ~930-900 Ma. Zr-in-rutile temperatures typically range from 720-780°C (up to ~850°C) across a range of mineral assemblages, indicating growth prior to peak conditions. However, U-Pb ages lack evidence for the older event, recording a thermal overprint that cooled through closure at ~520-510 Ma, despite large grain diameters up to 500 µm. This younger age is inferred to reflect moderate reheating of the crust in the absence of significant dynamic recrystallization, and can be linked to more intense Pan-African tectonism elsewhere in the region.\nThese two examples illustrate the decoupled nature of rutile thermometry and geochronology. Zr-in-rutile thermometry can reveal complex thermal histories of polycyclic terranes, whereas U-Pb geochronology typically records only the timing of cooling in HT/UHT rocks.",

The Ross Sea is the primary area of the Southern Ocean where sea ice is expanding, an expansion shown to be due to the earlier advance and later retreat of the ice. It is suggested that the ASL is the primary large/regional scale atmospheric circulation feature contributing to the variability of sea ice in the Ross Sea during the advance and retreat periods of the ice. Using observed sea ice concentration data, geopotential height, and indices describing the depth and location of the ASL this research establishes statistical links between the variability of the ASL during the advance and retreat periods of the ice. The results clarify which characteristic of the ASL exerts the strongest influence on the variability of ice in the Ross Sea and also in the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas. The ASL is projected to deepen in future decades and the effect of this deepening on sea ice in the Ross is also examined.",

            "abstract": "The collision of Eurasia with Arabia has given rise to intracontinental shortening in SE Turkey and development of large scale fault zones. The East Anatolian Fault Zone (EAFZ), a major active fault zone over 700 km in length with NE-striking, defines the boundary zone between Eurasia plate and Anatolian micro-plate. Although the northeastern continuation of the zone merges into the North Anatolian Fault Zone at Karliova region, the southwestern continuation has been the subject of some debate. The zone is characterized by numerous, complex faults and segmented surface ruptures. It cuts and offsets several distinctive units in east and southeast Turkey.\nThe portion of the EAFZ examined in this study extends from Celikhan to Turkoglu. Active fault strands in this portion of the EAFZ is termed the Erkenek and Golbasi segments. The zone is made of several NE-SW closely spaced strands cut across Mesozoic-to-Tertiary variable rock units and structures, indicating inception of strike-slip motion in Quaternary and characterized by a series of basins.\nFault-related several morphological features have been mapped are within the study area, suggesting the left-lateral motion of fault strands along this part of the EAFZ. Offset streams, beheaded channels, pressure and shutter ridges, linear valleys and ridges and sag ponds are prominent morpho-tectonic features. Offset streams have been measured as few meters to hundreds of meters and show sinistral displacement along the fault zone. Fault scarps, several tens of metres high, are developed in fan deposits along the length of the fault strands. Forming the set of linear sag ponds in Golbasi reveals extentional activity of the EAFZ in this area. Motion of fault strands formed linear valleys and ridges parallel to the faults which is most remarkable features. Our geomorphic studies demonstrated the ongoing activity of the the EAFZ between Celikhan to Turkoglu regions.",

            "abstract": "Pyrite (FeS2), a Pa3 space group non-magnetic semiconductor, is the most abundant iron sulfide in nature, yet the high cosmic abundance of sulfur is not reflected in the terrestrial crust, implying it is either sequestered in the Earth’s interior or was volatilized during accretion. As it has widely been suggested that sulfur could be one of the contributing light elements leading to the density deficit of Earth’s core, a robust thermal equation of state of FeS2 is vital for understanding the evolution and properties of Earth’s interior. We performed X-ray diffraction measurements on FeS2 at the GSECARS sector 13-ID-D and HPCAT sector 16-ID-B beamlines at the Advanced Photon Source. Pressures from 17 to 85 GPa and temperatures up to 2400 K were achieved using laser-heated diamond anvil cells. Pressures were determined from the lattice parameters of KBr [1], which served as an insulator and pressure medium, and temperatures were determined by spectroradiometry. No phase transitions were observed in the pyrite structure over the pressure and temperature ranges investigated. By combining our new P-V-T data with previously published room temperature compression data [2], we have determined a thermal equation of state for FeS2, with bulk modulus K=182.6(74) GPa, pressure derivative K’=3.82(25), and αKT=0.00329(45). Our revised equation of state for pyrite is consistent with a core density deficit satisfied by 9-10 wt.% sulfur. We compare these findings to previously published ab intio equation of state parameters for pyrite under a similar range of pressures [3]. [1] Fischer et al. (2012) EPSL 357-358, 268-276.

            "abstract": "We present the results of the last GPS campaign conducted over the Djiboutian part of Eastern Afar. A large and dense geodetic network has been measured regularly since the 90’s, and allows an accurate determination of the velocity field associated with the western tip of the Arabia-Somalia divergent plate boundary. Within the Tadjoura Gulf, the Aden ridge consists of a series of 3 en échelon, submerged spreading segments, except for the Asal segment, which is partly above water. The repetition of 6 to 7 measurements together with 6 permanent continuous GNSS stations allow an opportunity to study the spatial distribution of the active extension in relation to these 3 segments, but also to study time variations of the displacements, which are greatly expected to be transitory because of the occurrence of dyking events, small to intermediate seismic events, and volcanic activity. The divergent motion of the two margins of the Gulf occurs at ~15 mm/yr, which is consistent with the long-term estimates of the Arabia-Somalia motion. Across the Asal segment, this value confirms that the effect of the dyking event in 1978 has ended. The velocity gradients show that the deformation is distributed from the southern to the northern rift shoulder. As revealed by the InSAR data however, the along-axis variations of the deformation pattern, i.e. clear superficial active faults in the SE part of the rift and deep opening in the NW part, suggests the remaining influence of the previous dyke intrusions within the segment inner floor. The time series show that the velocity field was more heterogeneous before 2003, when the micro-seismic activity was significant, particularly around the volcanic center. The striking feature of the time evolution of the velocity field consists in the transition from an extension mainly localized across the Asal segment before 2003 to an extension more distributed, implying the influence of the southern Quaternary structures forming the Gaggade and Hanle Basins. This results in a decrease of the opening velocity across the Asal segment. This crucial change suggests that the activity of the volcanic/geothermal centre in the segment is a determining factor in the spatial organization of the deformation, by affecting the activity of the normal faults and thereby favoring the concentration of the extensive deformation.",

Of these graduates, 37% were Hispanic or African-American and 26% were women. Our graduates are high-achievers with 13% also graduating from the Honor’s College (campus-wide rate is less than 1.5%) and that included three women and two Hispanic graduates. Two of these recent graduates are doctoral candidates and eleven are master’s candidates at major universities. Of these, three master’s candidates are Hispanic, including two women, and one doctoral candidate is a Hispanic woman.\nThe recent productivity and quality changes in this program are attributed to our shift toward an undergraduate, student-centered focus. The increases in productivity resulted from the development of strong relationships with community colleges across the state and significant efforts in recruitment and retention. The major changes in quality included implementation of a strong field-oriented focus with full faculty participation, a strong undergraduate research program, a well-developed recruitment and retention plan, a GIS Certification incorporated into the geology degree, and a culture change to further student professional development. We have maintained over 50 majors in our program for the past three years through increased faculty presentations at high-schools and community colleges, a good University recruiting staff, and quarterly newsletters, focused on student achievements, sent to all prospective students and parents inquiring about the geology major.\nThe resurgence of the oil and gas industry and the retirement of geoscientists have provided a steady stream of job opportunities for our graduates. The 79% that are not pursuing a graduate education accepted jobs after graduation. These include oil and gas entry level jobs, mining jobs, teaching jobs, and geospatial jobs. Our graduates are in high demand due to their strong field skills, research and/or GIS background and professional development, which includes a required two-credit course led by local industry professionals.

In this study, we investigate the sensitivity of simulated low clouds (i.e. shallow cumulus and stratocumulus) to selected tunable parameters of CLUBB in the both single column and global version of CAM5. A quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling approach is adopted to effectively explore the high-dimensional parameter space and a generalized linear model is adopted to study the responses of simulated cloud fields to tunable parameters. Based on the assembled tests, our results show that most of the variance in simulated cloud fields can be explained by a small number of tunable parameters. For the single column version, the parameters related to Newtonian and buoyancy-damping terms of total water flux are found to be the most influential parameters for stratocumulus, while the parameters related to skewness of vertical velocity are found to be the most influential ones for shallow cumulus. The influential parameters in global simulations are generally consistent with those identified in the single column simulations, although significant regional deviations can be found. These regional deviations are related to particular cloud regimes and cloud microphysics scheme. The sets of parameters that perform favorably against observations are further identified and analyzed. This study improves understanding of the CLUBB behaviors associated with parameter uncertainties and provides valuable insights for other high-order cloud schemes.",

S Historical Climatology Network (HCN) , the Historical Canadian Climate Database (HCCD), and Precipitation Regression on Independent Slopes Method (PRISM) has been assembled over the Great Lakes and Midwest region from 1915-2012 at daily time step. These data were then used as inputs to the macro-scale Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrology model, implemented over the Midwest and Great Lakes region at 1/16 degree resolution, to produce simulated hydrologic variables that are amenable to long-term trend analysis. Trends in precipitation and temperature from the new meteorological driving data sets, as well as simulated hydrometeorological variables such as snowpack, soil moisture, runoff, and evaporation over the 20th century are presented and discussed.",

            "abstract": "Mountains areas are increasingly susceptible to wildfires because of warming climates. Although knowledge of the hydro-geomorphological impacts of wildfire has advanced in recent years, much is still unknown regarding how environmental fluxes move through burned watersheds. Because of the loss of vegetation and hydrophobic soils, flash floods often accompany elevated runoff events from burned watersheds, making direct process measurements challenging. Direct measurements are also only partly successful at capturing the spatial variations of post-fire effects. Coupled with short temporal windows for observing such responses, opportunities are often missed for collecting data needed for developing predictive models. Terrestrial LiDAR scanning (TLS) of burned areas allows detailed documentation of the post-fire topography to cm-level accuracy, providing pictures of geomorphic responses not previously possible. This paper reports a comparative study of hillslope-channel interactions, using repeat TLS, in two contrasting environments. Burned by the 2012 Waldo Canyon Fire and 2013 Springs Fire, in Colorado and California respectively, the study sites share many similarities including steep erosive slopes, small drainage areas, and step-pool channel morphologies. TLS provided a tool to test the central hypothesis that, dry ravel, distinct in the California Mediterranean environment, would prompt a greater sedimentological response from the Springs Fire compared to the Waldo Canyon Fire. At selected sites in each area, TLS documented baseline conditions immediately following the fire. Repeat scanning after major storms allowed detection of changes in the landscape. Results show a tendency for sedimentation in river channels in the study sites interacting with dry ravel on hillslopes, whereas erosion dominated the response from the Waldo Canyon Fire with an absence of dry ravel. These data provide clues to developing generalizations for post-fire effects at regional scales, which could assist with managing hazards from wildfires. TLS provides a promising tool to expand the range of studies concerning environmental responses through burned landscapes.",

            "abstract": "The tectonics of northwestern South America are controlled by the complex interactions of the South American, Nazca, and Caribbean plates. In order to better understand subduction within the region, we utilize data recorded by the Colombian National Seismic Network to calculate P-to-S receiver functions at a range of frequencies across the nation of Colombia. Where the station spacing was dense enough, receiver functions were stacked using the Common Conversion Point (CCP) method in order to better image lateral changes in crustal and upper mantle structure. Along the Pacific margin of Colombia, where the Nazca plate is subducting beneath South America, the subducting slab dips too steeply to image it with receiver functions. However, layering and strong negative arrivals are observed in the crust above the subducting slab where active volcanoes are present. The presence of these arrivals is possibly indicative of slab dehydration and the presence of partial melt within the crust. In northeastern Colombia, the Caribbean plate is subducting beneath South America at an oblique angle. Along the direction of convergence, the slab extends ~500 km inland with a relatively shallow dip before steepening. Preliminary receiver function images from this region show a shallowly-dipping negative arrival, interpreted as the top of the slab. This arrival is underlain by a positive conversion, interpreted as the down-going oceanic Moho. As the dip of the seismicity associated with the subducting slab steepens, these arrivals are no longer observed within the receiver function stacks. These cross sections of the Caribbean plate subduction are consistent with the idea that phase changes within the downgoing oceanic crust and mantle are controlling the slab buoyancy and, as a result, the angle of subduction. As the receiver functions are refined and further combined with local earthquake locations, we will better be able to understand the location of earthquakes within the subducting slab and the role of slab hydration and subsequent dehydration in the region’s seismicity.",

At the national level we have had estimates of the abundance of GIWs, but no spatially explicit calculations or data, frustrating efforts to quantify the presence and effects of connectivity at significant and relevant scales. Using the National Wetland Inventory and the National Hydrography Dataset, we quantified the abundance and spatial extent of GIWs across the coterminous United States.

            "abstract": "Galveston Bay (Texas) is characterized by the unique and complex mixing of waters allowing the bay to produce more seafood than any bay in the United States with the exception of Chesapeake Bay (Maryland). The concentration of Chlorophyll-a plays a key role in ecosystem productivity. Since field measurements are complicated and expensive, satellite remote sensing provides an opportunity to observe real-time variations of Chlorophyll-a at a large spatial scale. However, because of the notable influences caused by the absorption and scattering of other substances (such as total suspended solids, dissolved organic matters and tripton), the use of ocean color remote sensing images to estimate Chlorophyll-a in coastal waters is usually limited. In order to monitor the variation of Chlorophyll-a with high accuracy (and at a high temporal resolution), an algorithm was developed using Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance data, Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images, and in-situ measurements. This approach mainly contains two steps. First, based on the relatively high spatial resolution of Landsat images (30m), an exponential regression relationship was found between the Landsat reflectance ratio (i.e., band 3/band 4) and the in-situ measured Chlorophyll-a concentrations (R2 = 0.81) during the two-year sampling period (2005- 2006). By using an automatic outlier detection technique for quality control, a Landsat Chlorophyll-a concentration product from 2000- 2011 was generated. Second, in order to improve the temporal resolution over the bay area, an 8-day MODIS product at 500 m spatial resolution from 2000 to 2013 was created. Landsat results from the first step were employed to calibrate the parameters used in NASA’s existing operational product algorithm. This way, the MODIS product from this study can best represent the phytoplankton productivity in Galveston Bay. Using the remotely sensed Chlorophyll-a product, further comparisons were made among phytoplankton productivity, climate indices, and inflows.",

            "abstract": "Arctic tundra ecosystems will play an important role in the global carbon cycle in coming decades and centuries. Amplified climate warming at high northern latitudes has stimulated carbon uptake via plant productivity, while thawing permafrost is releasing carbon to the atmosphere. Accurately quantifying the effect of changing tundra ecosystems on global climate will require detailed understanding of both of these processes. In this context, accounting for the spatial variation of landscape features is critical to creating carbon budgets for ecosystems and regions, and for forecasting the effects of climate change in the tundra. Water tracks and other areas that feature channelized subsurface water flow are landscape features with distinct differences in carbon stocks and fluxes relative to adjacent upland tundra areas. Numerous studies have shown that water tracks and flowpaths have greater water and nutrient availability that leads relatively high carbon stocks and rates of carbon uptake. However a clear understanding of the relative proportion of tundra ecosystems that are comprised of these landscape features is lacking.\nRecently developed fine-scale remote sensing technology allows for the spatial analysis of tundra landscapes and specifically water tracks. This study automates process of distinguishing water tracks through the use of image classification and segmentation techniques on high-resolution satellite imagery. Both supervised and unsupervised classification techniques identify water tracks as distinctive and tundra landscape features. Unlike the unsupervised classification, edge detection and region-thresholding algorithms in the supervised classification differentiates water tracks from locations with high productivity by assessing connectivity shape.\nDepending on the area of inquiry, water tracks comprise roughly 10%-25% of the landscape. Field observations indicate that water tracks have greater plant productivity, and rates of carbon cycling. Failing to account for these landscape features will lead to errors in regional carbon and methane budgets.",

This easy-to-use hands-on activity focuses on questions such as “How do environmental conditions control decomposition of organic matter in soil?” and “Why do some areas accumulate organic matter and others do not?” Soil organic matter is important to local ecosystems because it affects soil structure, regulates soil moisture and temperature, and provides energy and nutrients to soil organisms. It is also important globally because it stores a large amount of carbon, and when microbes “eat”, or decompose organic matter they release greenhouse gasses such as carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere, which affects the earth’s climate. The protocol describes a commonly used method to measure decomposition using a paper made of cellulose, a component of plant cell walls. Participants can receive pre-made cellulose decomposition bags, or make decomposition bags using instructions in the protocol and easily obtained materials (e.g., window screen and lignin-free paper). Individual results will be shared with all participants and the broader public through an online database. We will present decomposition bag results from a research site in Alaskan tundra, as well as from a middle-school-student led experiment in California. The GDP demonstrates how scientific methods can be extended to educate broader audiences, while at the same time, data collected by students and the public can provide new insight into global patterns of soil decomposition.

            "abstract": "Despite the simplified notion of erosion as a top down process, landforms evolve by both vertical and horizontal migration of surface features. Low-temperature thermochronometry has the potential to resolve laterally migrating features if vertical relief is the same scale as the closure depth of the thermochronometer. In actively eroding landscapes this is about 2 km for (U-Th)/He thermochronometry. The issue of migrating surface topography has been addressed at a large scale in the cases of mountain divide migration and plateau retreat, but not for glacial and fluvial valley formation. Here we show that valley walls will have distinct ‘C’ shaped patterns of cooling age vs. elevation in valleys formed by retreating escarpments. The other end-member, a prograding escarpment will exhibit a distinct ‘7’ shaped age-elevation profile. Our schematic model simulates propagation of an escarpment in a valley for a range of vertical rock velocities and horizontal escarpment velocities and cooling ages are predicted for a range of isotherms. High temperature isotherms are essentially flat and the exhumation rate determined from the cooling age-elevation profile is exactly equal to the vertical rock velocity regardless of the horizontal velocity of the migrating feature. Very low temperature isotherms are highly perturbed by the overlying topography and the magnitude and direction of the horizontal rock velocity towards the surface greatly influence the shape of the cooling age-elevation profile. We show that valleys carved by headward erosion have relatively older low temperature cooling ages at low elevations, characterized by a ‘C’ shaped cooling age-elevation profile. This pattern of cooling ages is also expected for landscapes that have undergone a decrease in topographic relief, highlighting the potential of misinterpretation of low-temperature thermochronometric data. Traditional analysis of thermochronometric data collected along vertical transects has focused on evaluating the resulting age distribution in terms of exhumation rate and changes in topographic relief. We show its potential use for reconstructing headward valley erosion through geologic time.",

            "abstract": "Estimation of the effective permeability tensor is an essential part of Darcy-scale representations of flow in porous media. The permeability tensor itself is a property of the medium, and depends only on the microscale geometry of the system. Determining the functional relationships between effective permeability (or conductivity in the general sense) and the structure of the medium is an old problem, with the earliest results for ordered porous media dating the 1920's.\nIn this presentation, we report on the results of (1) detailed theory development, and (2) computations for the effective permeability tensor in fully-saturated random sphere packs, with a focus on the computational results. The theory is developed by volume averaging the Stokes equations, and using developing appropriate closures via potential theory, and has been reported on previously. For the computations, we have adopted an immersed boundary method to fully resolve the pore-scale velocity field. From our results, we compute the hydraulic permeability for both ordered and random media, and we compare these results with existing analytical solutions for the hydraulic conductivity in periodic arrays.",

            "abstract": "Grasslands in the Southern Great Plains of the United States are sensitive to drought. Previous studies have utilized a variety of methods and indices to monitor drought and assess the impacts. These drought indices were based on climate data such as precipitation and surface air temperature. However, water-related vegetation indices such as land surface water index (LSWI) have not been widely used as an indicator of drought severity at large scales. In this study, we analyzed land surface temperature (LST) data (MYD11A2) and LSWI data (MOD09A1) from 2006 and 2007 (H10V05, covering parts of Oklahoma and Kansas) to assess drought. First, LST data from an entire year were used to define and map the temperature-defined plant growing season (start and end dates as well as duration of LST > 5 °C). Second, LSWI data from within the LST-based growing season were used to assess vegetation growing condition and delineate the LSWI-based growing season (between the first date and the last date when LSWI > 0). The number of days with LSWI < 0 within the LSWI-based growing season is around zero in a year without summer droughts (e.g. 2007), but increases substantially in a year with severe summer droughts (e.g. 2006), varying between 100 to 150 day. Four levels (severe drought, moderate drought, abnormally dry, and no drought) of drought indicators were used to define the drought severity of grasslands based on the length of the LSWI-based growing season and the total number of LSWI < 0. Preliminary results revealed that the frequency of LSWI < 0 within the LSWI-defined growing season corresponded well with the drought condition in 2006. The LSWI-based approach developed in this study, at a spatial resolution of 500-m and a temporal resolution of 8-day, may provide an additional drought indicator in the Southern Great Plains.",

            "abstract": "Solubility and partitioning of elements during early planetary history is critical in understanding element concentrations and distribution in the terrestrial planets. Nitrogen is the most depleted element in the bulk silicate Earth relative to CI chondrites [1], which may be explained by its high pressure behavior under reduced conditions relevant to planetary accretion and differentiation. Under oxidized conditions N dissolves in silicate melts as N2, but as fO2 decreases N-H species become the dominant form of dissolved N and the solubility increases [2-7]. DNmetal/melt (the N partition coefficient between metal and melt) is affected by pressure, fO2, fH2, and metal composition [3-5] but with less than 20 published experiments over a wide pressure range, these dependencies have been poorly constrained. Here we present new N-bearing experiments on graphite-saturated silicate melts in equilibrium with Fe-rich metallic melts. Experiments were performed at 1.2 GPa and 1400 ˚C in a piston cylinder apparatus, with N added as Si3N4, FexN, and urea [(NH2)2CO] to basaltic starting compositions. Glassy and metallic run products were gold coated and analyzed by EMPA. Detection limits and standard errors in N concentrations were improved (e.g. better than 1% for > 0.4 wt% N) relative to previous studies [2-5] by fitting non-linear backgrounds to wavelength-scans on standards and unknowns. Preliminary experiments with fO2 of IW-2 to IW-4 produced glasses with a maximum of 0.6 wt% N and metals with a maximum of 1.1 wt% N. DNmetal/melt are comparable to values at a similar pressure determined in the LH-DAC [5]. Further experiments will explore the effects of fO2 and H content on DN and N solubility. ",

            "abstract": "Solar nebular models suggest that magnetic fields are central to the redistribution of mass and angular momentum in the protoplanetary disk. Using individual chondrules with patches of dusty olivine the strength of these magnetic fields can be measured due to presence of nanoscale Fe inclusions. Since chondrules formed by rapid heating and cooling in the early solar nebula, individual chondrules have the potential to record the magnetic field that was present during their formation, and retain this signal for several billion years. Recently the first robust paleointensity measurement of nebular fields was compleated by measureing dusty olivine grains from the Semarkona LL3.0 ordinary chondrite meteorite in a SQUID microscope. (Fu et al. this meeting) Extracting quantitative information from the paleomagnetic meaurements requires a full understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms producing the measured magnetic signal.\nHere we characterise the magnetic behaviour of the same dusty olivine chondrules, using a variety of electron microscopy techniques. Electron holography and Lorentz imaging confirm the dominance of single vortex (SV) states in the majority of the remanence carriers. In-field measurements demonstrate the high stability of this SV state, making them suitable carriers of paleomagnetic information. We present a 3D volume reconstruction of the dusty olivine using Focussed-Ion-Beam (FIB) slice-and-view tomography. Combining the selective milling properties of FIB with the high spatial resolution of the Scanning Electron Microscope we are able to capture images as we make successive slices through a selected region of the sample. For this initial study we present a collection of 400 images taken every 10 nm as we slice through an 10 µm x 10 µm x 4 µm volume of the dusty olivine patch within a single chondrule. Each image possesses resolution around 10 nm allowing us to resolve particles in both the single domain and single vortex size ranges. Once assembled the full data provies quantitative statistics on particle-size distribution, shapes and interparticle spacing. The information is then used to model the macroscopic paleomagnetic properties. This work further extends the central role of electron microscopy in determining the underlying physics of the remanence acquisition process.",

            "abstract": "During IODP Expedition 348 from October 2013 to January 2014, Site C0002 was drilled to more than 3000 meters’ depth into the inner accretionary wedge at the Nankai Trough, setting a new depth record for scientific ocean drilling. It is the first hole to access the deep interior of an active convergent margin. Site C0002 is part of the NanTroSEIZE project off the Kii-Kumano region of Japan, designed to shed light on plate boundary fault zone processes near the up-dip edge of seismogenic locking and slip. The zone from 865 – 3056 meters below the sea floor was sampled via logging-while-drilling measurements, continuous sampling of drill cuttings, and limited coring. This interval was composed of lithified middle to late Miocene hemipelagic sediments and turbidites that are markedly deformed and dip steeply. P-wave speeds from sonic logs increase with depth to ~ 1600 meters, but are constant to slightly decreasing with depth from 1600 to 3050 meters. We hypothesize that this change in trend indicates the onset of elevated pore fluid pressure, but structural and lithologic factors may also play a role. We explore several methods for quantitative estimation of sonic-derived fluid pressure conditions in the inner wedge. A borehole leak-off test (LOT) and a series of borehole pressurization and injection tests were also performed, which we synthesize to estimate the least principal stress, or Shmin. Furthermore, downhole pressure while drilling (PWD) measurements recorded during borehole packoff events provide information on the maximum principal stress, SHmax. Taken together, the LOT and PWD observations suggest that the inner wedge at ~ 2000 meters depth is currently in a strike-slip stress regime, despite its position as the hanging wall of a main plate boundary thrust. This may be a transitional stress regime between shallow normal and deep thrust, controlled by depth-dependent magnitude of the tectonic convergence-related principal stress. Our results document for the first time the stress conditions and material properties in the deep interior of the upper plate to the shallow seismogenic zone.",

            "abstract": "While interactions between atmospheric waves and mean zonal flows have been the focus of extensive research, the same cannot be said of the dynamics of waves in the presence of purely meridional background flow. In the deep tropics, though, where the mean zonal flow nearly vanishes, such dynamics are of central importance. Based on the Intraseasonal Multiscale Moist Dynamics (IMMD) system of Biello and Majda (2010), a simplified set of equations describing the behavior of equatorial atmospheric waves in the presence of a planetary-scale overturning meridional-vertical circulation were derived. The IMMD's scaling is appropriate to describe zonally-long anomalies around a mean climatology and thus provides a framework to study the Madden-Julian oscillation. The result of the present derivation is a coupled two-layer equatorial shallow water system, the solutions of which--planetary and equatorially trapped Rossby waves--do not interact in the absence of the background circulation but resonate under certain conditions for nonzero meridonal/vertical background flow; this coupling suggests a mechanism for energy exchange between the tropical atmosphere and that of the middle latitudes. In the absence of diffusion the coupled system is Hermitian, and therefore all solutions are stable; in contrast to wave stability in the presence of zonal shear flow this point is particularly striking. For all numerical computations the prescribed background circulation mimics the vertical and meridional components of the Hadley cell, the dominant structure of large-scale equatorial atmospheric flow. Numerical results for small diffusion include the slowing, but lack of dissipation, of equatorial Rossby waves and the robustness of the equatorial Kelvin wave.",

CyberShake integrates large-scale parallel and high-throughput serial seismological research codes into a processing framework in which early stages produce files used as inputs by later stages. Scientific workflow tools are used to manage the jobs, data, and metadata. The Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) developed the CyberShake platform using USC High Performance Computing and Communications systems and open-science NSF resources.\nCyberShake calculations were migrated to the NSF Track 1 system NCSA Blue Waters when it became operational in 2013, via an interdisciplinary team approach including domain scientists, computer scientists, and middleware developers. Due to the excellent performance of Blue Waters and CyberShake software optimizations, we reduced the makespan (a measure of wallclock time-to-solution) of a CyberShake study from 1467 to 342 hours. We will describe the technical enhancements behind this improvement, including judicious introduction of new GPU software, improved scientific software components, increased workflow-based automation, and Blue Waters-specific workflow optimizations.\nOur CyberShake performance improvements highlight the benefits of scientific workflow tools. The CyberShake workflow software stack includes the Pegasus Workflow Management System (Pegasus-WMS, which includes Condor DAGMan), HTCondor, and Globus GRAM, with Pegasus-mpi-cluster managing the high-throughput tasks on the HPC resources. The workflow tools handle data management, automatically transferring about 13 TB back to SCEC storage.\nWe will present performance metrics from the most recent CyberShake study, executed on Blue Waters. We will compare the performance of CPU and GPU versions of our large-scale parallel wave propagation code, AWP-ODC-SGT. Finally, we will discuss how these enhancements have enabled SCEC to move forward with plans to increase the CyberShake simulation frequency to 1.0 Hz.",

            "abstract": "Soil erosion is a serious environmental problem in Nozhian Watershed, which is located in Lorestan province of western Iran. Relatively steep slope, heavy precipitation, lack of dense vegetation cover and geological properties of the soil have been attributed as the main factors affecting erosion in the region. The aim of this study is to apply both radar interferometry and empirical methods to evaluate soil erosion pattern in Nozhian and its impact on surface deformation.\nFor the empirical model the following factors were applied to calculate erosion rate: rainfall-runoff erosivity (R), soil erodibility (K), slope length and steepness (LS), cover management (C) and support practice (P). The R-factor was produced from annual precipitation data, K-factor was developed from soil maps and geological information, LS-factors were calculated from digital elevation model (DEM) and C-factor was created from Landsat-7 ETM images and land cover maps. All factors were then integrated in a GIS environment to derive soil erosion map. For the radar interferometry we utilized 9 PALSAR images acquired by the ALOS satellite between 22 July 2007 and 9 November 2009 and processed them using the Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) technique to obtain time-series maps of surface deformation.\nThe results of InSAR time-series analysis are compared with the information obtained from empirical modeling for quantitative and qualitative assessment of different factors contributing to the erosion. We show that the information obtained by these two independent methods are complemnatry and help us gain a comprehensive and better evaluation of soil loss rate and spatial erosion pattern.",

            "abstract": "Climate changes over the past few million years have been driven by a variety of concurrent forcings, such as changes in orbit, greenhouse gas concentrations, and growth and decay of ice sheets, among others. However, understanding the precise roles of each of these forcings in driving aspects of the climate system, such as tropical precipitation, can be difficult to determine from snapshot simulations or proxy records alone. To better investigate the roles of each forcing in influencing tropical precipitation, and to investigate the degree to which past changes may be regarded as a linear combination of responses to individual forcings, idealized simulations are run with the GFDL CM2.1, a coupled atmosphere-ocean GCM, to isolate the climate response to each forcing. By scaling and combining these idealized simulations, linear reconstructions of past climate can be made. Comparison of these linear reconstructions with snapshot simulations at the mid-Holocene and last glacial maximum show that the linear reconstructions do a reasonable job approximating many aspects of tropical precipitation change in the model, although some mismatches do exist. In regions where a linear reconstruction does a good job replicating precipitation changes, the components of the reconstruction can offer insight into the mechanisms driving the change. Monsoons are well captured by the linear reconstructions, and respond strongly to precession at the mid-Holocene and greenhouse gases and ice sheets at the LGM. The idealized simulations help isolate the influence of each forcing so that cause and effect relationships may be more easily explored. Linear reconstructions can also be compared against tropical proxy records to help test hypotheses of past precipitation change.",

            "abstract": "Many studies have been done regarding performance of hydraulically fractured horizontal wells in the Bakken Shale Play (Wiley et. al., 2004; Mille et. al., 2008; Tabatabaei et. al., 2009). It’s of great interest that whether the invaded brine causes the gas shale layer to behave differently in seismic profile due to potentially important application on reservoir monitoring and management for gas shale reservoirs. Because gas shale formations are generally much thinner than their adjacent layers (usually less than 100 meters), it’s usually difficult to pick the reflection wave response of gas shale layer from in-situ seismic profile. Therefore, we have designed a workflow to investigate the effects of hydraulic fracture in gas shale reservoir by using synthetic seismic survey on simplified subsurface model. The simplified model mainly consists of several horizontally homogeneous layers of sand and shale, whereas the hydraulic fracture occurs in the middle thin gas shale formation and causes brine invasion in part of it. The goal of the synthetic seismic investigation is to see how the response of the reflection wave from this layer behaves differently due to the hydraulic fracture. Due to the thickness and complex nature of shale reservoir, the greatest challenge would be to pick the seismic response of this formation from the background noise and to study the range of thickness and the depth of burial for this layer to be seismically detectable for the purpose of hydraulic fracture study. Seismic investigation is rarely used in the reservoir monitoring of gas shale reservoir due to seismic resolution limit. Thus, this study will help to explore potential seismic applications for gas shale reservoirs and improve understanding of seismic response of hydraulic fracture on unconventional reservoirs.",

            "abstract": "Source Time Functions (STFs) describe how the seismic moment (Mo) is released with time. In addition to moment magnitude Mw, they carry information on more detailed rupture properties, such as static stress drop Δσ and radiated energy Er. Here we systematically analyze a set of 1500 STFs extracted from the SCARDEC method (Vallée et al 2011), containing the Mw>5.8, shallow (z<70 km) earthquakes with normal or inverse mechanisms that occurred in the past 20 years. At the global scale, we confirm the scale-invariance of Δσ with magnitude, while the apparent stress µEr/Mo slightly increases with seismic moment. In a second step, the source parameters distribution is investigated in light of the tectonic context of the earthquakes: we find that subduction interplate earthquakes have lower stress drop and apparent stress relative to all other earthquakes (e.g. crustal earthquakes), in agreement with other approaches (Houston, 2001; Allmann and Shearer, 2009). This observation may reflect the fact that subduction plate boundaries host a very large number of earthquakes, making the fault zone “mature”; or, it may be the consequence of the hydrated subducted materials leading to specific frictional properties. This finding may explain why damages observed after crustal earthquakes tend to be larger than the ones due to subduction earthquakes of the same magnitude. We finally focus on subduction interplate earthquakes (approximately 700 earthquakes) by considering 18 regional segments of subduction zones. We find that these segments do not have the same signature in terms of dynamic rupture properties, which means that large scale plate convergence properties influence rupture behavior. In a given segment, local heterogeneities of stress drop or radiated energy can be associated with local features of the subduction zone: in particular, we find that low coupled zones generate earthquakes with low stress drop and apparent stress.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the relationship between slip and tremor during multiple recent slow slip events in northern Cascadia. While the relationship of geodetically detectable slow slip and nonvolcanic tremor appears to be broadly coincident, the exact spatial and temporal characteristics remain unclear at a finer scale. Typical GPS derived slip distributions tend to be spatially and temporally smoothed and offset slightly updip of tremor distributions. These discrepancies may be real, or they may be a consequence of the resolution of GPS data or an artifact of the inversion methodology. Borehole strainmeters provide additional independent geodetic constraints for characterizing slip, provide greater temporal resolution, and greater precision than GPS. However, various non-tectonic artifacts and other sources of error have limited the number of usable stations and made deriving reliable information from strainmeters during slip events difficult.\nWe utilize strainmeters with low levels of noise and minimal observable artifacts to constrain forward models and to provide additional independent observations in joint geodetic inversions with GPS data. A series of slip distributions are derived by inverting strainmeter and GPS data using the Kalman-filter-based Extended Network Inversion Filter. To compare the tremor distributions to the geodetically derived slip we also construct slip distributions using tremor occurrences as a proxy for localized slip on the plate interface. The magnitude of slip per tremor occurrence is then scaled to best match the observed surface displacements. Separate slip distributions informed by GPS and tremor are then used to predict strain time series. The comparisons between strain predictions and observations produce mixed results. This may indicate that that tremor and slip are not always coincident. This is particularly evident during the Aug. 2010 event, where the peak GPS-derived slip is located in a region with decreased tremor activity. Preliminary results also show that shifting the peak tremor-derived slip updip a few kilometers decreases the overall misfit of the displacements, supporting the conclusion that the peak tremor activity occurs slightly downdip of the peak slip.",

            "abstract": "Recovery of riverine ecosystems following disturbance is driven by a variety of interacting processes. Wildfires pose increasing disturbances to riverine landscapes, with rising frequencies and magnitudes owing to warming climates and increased fuel loads. The effects of wildfire include loss of vegetation, elevated runoff and flash floods, erosion and deposition, and changing biological habitats and communities. Understanding process interactions in post-fire landscapes is increasingly urgent for successful management and restoration of affected ecosystems. In steep channels, steps and pools provide prominent habitats for organisms and structural integrity in high energy environments. Step-pools are typically stable, responding to extreme events with recurrence intervals often exceeding 50 years. Once wildfire occurs, however, intensification of post-fire flood events can potentially overpower the inherent stability of these systems, with significant consequences for aquatic life and human well-being downstream. This study examined the short-term response of step-pool streams following the 2012 Waldo Canyon Fire in Colorado. We explored interacting feedbacks among geomorphology, hydrology, and ecology in the post-fire environment. At selected sites with varying burn severity, we established baseline conditions immediately after the fire with channel surveys, biological assessment using benthic macroinvertebrates, sediment analysis including pebble counts, and precipitation gauging. Repeat measurements after major storm events over several years enabled analysis of the interacting feedbacks among post-fire processes. We found that channels able to retain the step-pool structure changed less and facilitated recovery more readily. Step habitats maintained higher percentages of sensitive macroinvertebrate taxa compared to pools through post-fire floods. Sites burned with high severity experienced greater reduction in the percentage of sensitive taxa. The decimation of macroinvertebrates closely coincides with the physical destruction of the step-pool morphology. The role that step-pools play in enhancing the ecological quality of fluvial systems, therefore, provides a key focus for effective management and restoration of aquatic resources following wildfires.",

A twenty-four member physics ensemble of climate simulations using the state-of-the-art Weather Research and Forecasting Model at sufficient resolution to capture high-impact weather has been run over an extended North American domain of approximately 25° S to 70° N and from the African coast to the East Pacific. A diverse set of approaches are being applied to examine the impact of the different physics parameterizations on the simulated climate and high-impact weather statistics and to determine the physics combinations that result in physically realistic scenarios.\nIn this paper we explore one such approach that evaluates the performance of the ensemble using Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs). The SOMs are used to: 1) identify the ensemble members that are able to capture current climate weather patterns and their relative frequencies, and 2) investigate the underlying interactions between the different physics components that leads to differences in these patterns across the ensemble.

            "abstract": "In current climate models, the model resolution is too coarse to explicitly resolve deep convective systems. Parameterization schemes are therefore needed to represent the physical processes at the sub-grid scale. Recently, an approach based on assumed probability density functions (PDFs) has been developed to help unify the various parameterization schemes used in current global models. In particular, a unified parameterization scheme called the Cloud Layers Unified By Binormals (CLUBB) scheme has been developed and tested successfully for shallow boundary-layer clouds. CLUBB’s implementation in the Community Atmosphere Model, version 5 (CAM5) is also being extended to treat deep convection cases, but parameterizing subgrid-scale vertical transport of hydrometeors remains a challenge. To investigate the roots of the problem and possible solutions, we generate a high-resolution benchmark simulation of a deep convection case using a cloud-resolving model (CRM) called System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM). We use the high-resolution 3D CRM results to assess the prognostic and diagnostic higher-order moments in CLUBB that are in relation to the subgrid-scale transport of hydrometeors. We also analyze the heat and moisture budgets in terms of CLUBB variables from the SAM benchmark simulation. The results from this study will be used to devise a better representation of vertical subgrid-scale transport of hydrometeors by utilizing the sub-grid variability information from CLUBB.",

            "abstract": "Forests influence local climate through biophysical processes. It is well established that boreal forests have a warming effect by reducing albedo and tropical forests have a cooling effect due to increased evapotranspiration. However the influence of temperate forests on climate is less certain. Previous model experiments have shown the average effect of temperate forests as a whole to be a weak warming effect. However, some non-model studies that examine these effects at the sub-biome level show a latitudinal gradient of effects presumably due to differences in climate; while other studies show variation in biophysical effects due to forest type that is independent of latitude. Using the Community Earth System Model, we explore spatial variation in the direction and magnitude of the climate response to simulated deforestation in temperate forests. Our analysis focuses on the relative importance of pre-deforestation temperature, pre-deforestation precipitation, and the percentage of a grid cell occupied by needle-leaf evergreen trees as factors explaining how deforestation influences climate. We use results from deforestation simulations where forests are subdivided into temperature and precipitation clusters to develop a statistical model that predicts the change in regional air temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity based on climate. To examine the sensitivity of results to the plant-type we repeated the simulations of deforestation in the climate clusters using two pre-deforestation forest compositions: 100% needle-leaf evergreen trees (0 % broad-leaf deciduous) and 0% needle-leaf evergreen trees (100 % broad-leaf deciduous). Overall, we found that within the temperate forests warmer, wetter forests cooled climate while cooler, wetter forests warmed climate. The influence of plant-type was most pronounced in cooler regions. Our results help better understand how land-cover change in the temperate region influences climate and highlights how changes in climate alter the ability of temperature forests to have a biophysically cooling influence on climate.",

In an earlier statistical study using THEMIS-ASI observations, we have shown that the PPA mainly drift eastward after midnight and westward before midnight suggestive of the drift velocity of the patches is tied to convection (E × B\ndrift\n). Comparing patch velocities inferred from THEMIS-ASI image sequences and ionospheric convection inferred from SuperDARN data, we found out that in four events, the PPA patches were moving at the local convection velocity, within experimental error. Due to uncertainties in inferring convection velocity from the SuperDARN measurements, we need to check this result. Here, we compare patch velocities inferred from THEMIS-ASI data with drift velocities in the topside ionosphere measured by the ESA Swarm satellites. Our results corroborate those of our earlier studies, and we assert that PPA motion is EXB convection. Given that the processes that define the shape of PPA patches occur near the magnetospheric equator, our results indicate that cold magnetospheric plasma plays a key role in determining patch shape and evolution. Further, our results point the way to remote sensing equatorial convection in the inner magnetosphere from images of PPA.",

            "abstract": "Multi-angle spectro-polarimetry holds great potential as a remote sensing technique to derive aerosol information. A consortium of Dutch research institutes has developed a multi-angle spectro-polarimeter that is based on a novel method for measuring the state of linear polarization: spectral modulation.\nThrough a series of carefully selected birefringent crystals, the polarization state of scattered sunlight is encoded in a sinusoidal modulation in the intensity spectrum.The technique is entirely passive. As consequence of the method is that spectral flux and state of polarization are measured simultaneouslyin a single measurement of a target scene.\nThe technique has been employed in two instrument realizations, that are both referenced by the name SPEX: SPectro-polarimeter Experiment. A compact prototype SPEX instrument for space-based observations operates in the 400-800nm wavelength range and consists of nine fixed viewing apertures with a swath of 7 degrees each and an angular resolution of 1deg x 1deg. The space-SPEX instrument is currently being made fit to perform aerosol characterization campaigns on-board an ER-2 research aircraft together with NASA’s Research Scanning Polarimeter. Another realization is groundSPEX, that was developed specifically for air-quality observations made from the ground.\n Both instruments were calibrated using 100% polarized light, assuming a bias-free linear response. This was validated in different ways. Using a recently developed polarization calibration stimulus we demonstrate the excellent polarimetric performance of the SPEX prototype: a polarimetric accuracy better than 0.002 + 0.01*DoLP. The overall random polarization error of groundSPEX was determined to be 0.005 by fitting the angular dependence of principle plane polarization measurements.\nWe will present results of ground-based measurements with both SPEX instruments. We will intercompare aerosol characterization parameters such as Aerosol Optical Thickness, refractive index, and effective radii, and also compare SPEX retrievals with products of the co-located Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) station. The results indicate that the SPEX measurement concept has the power to deliver high quality aerosol parameters.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater recharge is the primary source of aquifer replenishment, an important source of freshwater for human consumption and riparian area sustainability in semi-arid regions. It is critical to understand the current groundwater recharge regimes in groundwater basins throughout the Western U.S. and how those regimes might shift in the face of climate change, land use change and management manipulations that impact the availability and composition of groundwater resources. Watersheds in the Basin and Range Province are characterized by a variable precipitation regime of wet winters, and variable summer precipitation. The horst-graben structure of these basins lends itself to orographic and continental precipitation effects that make mountain block and mountain front recharge critical components of annual recharge. The current assumption is that the relative contributions to groundwater recharge by summer and winter precipitation vary throughout the province, with winter precipitation dominating in the northern parts of the region, and summer monsoonal precipitation playing a more significant role in the south, where the North American Monsoon extends its influence. To test this hypothesis, stable water isotope data of groundwater and precipitation from sites in Sonora, Mexico and the U.S. states of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas were examined to characterize and compare groundwater recharge regimes throughout the region. Preliminary stable water isotope results from the southernmost Rio San Miguel Basin in Sonora, Mexico indicate that groundwater is composed of 64%±14% summer monsoon precipitation, in contrast to more northern basins where winter precipitation is the source of 79-90% of basin groundwater.",

            "abstract": "Aizawl, the capital city of Mizoram, India, is highly susceptible to deep-seated landslides. Weak and porous shale and sandstone bedrock, high levels of precipitation during the monsoon season, steep hillslopes, and unregulated development contribute to this problem. M > 7 earthquakes along megathrusts beneath the Burma Fold Belt could trigger over 1,100 landslides and endanger over 300,000 people, increasing the severity of the landslide risk. In this study, we surveyed two slides in the south and east parts of Aizawl and from crack orientations we have inferred ground motion and created vector maps of the two slides. A shallow slope stability analysis (SHALSTAB) for the Aizawl area enabled us to map zones of relative hazard in Aizawl and the vicinity. Our SHALSTAB analysis suggests that 44% of our study area in Aizawl is unconditionally unstable. Similarly, preliminary results from a Newmark Deformation Analysis indicate that nearly 50% of our study area would result in landslide-inducing displacement under seismic loading from a magnitude 7 event. Both results indicate unconditionally unstable conditions in the south and east sides of Aizawl, which agree with our field investigation. We are analyzing Interferometry synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data collected between 1998 and 2010 that we hope will demonstrate a seasonal time series of slope deformation for the region and determine slide velocities. With data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) we expect to confirm a correlation between slope movement and landslide occurrence with seasonal and annual precipitation.",

            "abstract": "Riparian systems across the American southwest region are under threat from a growing and intertwined cast of natural and anthropogenic stressors, including flooding, drought, invasion by non-native plants, wildfire, urban encroachment, and land- and water-use practices. In relatively remote and unregulated systems like the upper Gila River in Arizona, riparian habitat value has persisted reasonably well despite much of it being densely infested with non-native tamarisk (salt cedar). A new concern in the watershed, however, is the eventual arrival of the tamarisk leaf beetle that is expected to soon colonize the tamarisk-infested riparian corridor as the beetle continues to spread across the southwest region. While there are numerous potential benefits to tamarisk suppression (e.g., groundwater conservation, riparian habitat recovery, fire-risk reduction), short-term negative consequences are also possible, such as altered channel hydraulics and canopy defoliation during bird nesting season (e.g., the endangered southwestern willow flycatcher). In preparation for anticipated impacts following beetle colonization, we developed a holistic restoration framework to promote recovery of native riparian habitat and subsequent local increases in avian population. Pivotal to this process was an ecohydrological assessment that identified sustainable restoration sites based on consideration of natural and anthropogenic factors that, together, influence restoration opportunities—flood-scour dynamics, vegetation community structure and resilience, surface- and groundwater availability, soil texture and salinity, wildfire potential, and land-use activities. Data collected included high-resolution remote-sensing products, GIS-based delineation of geomorphic activity, and vegetation field mapping. These data along with other information generated, including pre-biocontrol vegetation monitoring and flycatcher-habitat modeling, were synthesized to produce a comprehensive restoration plan that highlights those areas of the river best suited for active restoration and, ultimately, assist watershed managers in development and prioritization of ecologically appropriate restoration strategies.",

The pool of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the Delta and SFE represents a mixture of river-derived material — the integration of watershed catchment processes — and locally derived wetland DOM. Physical, biological, and chemical transformation and removal processes influence the composition of this DOM pool on timescales ranging from seconds to hours. Measuring DOM composition and concentration in estuarine environments on scales at which they are forced is impractical using traditional grab sampling and laboratory-based analysis. To better accomplish this, we deployed in-situ instrumentation to provide high frequency measurement of velocity and optically based biogeochemical proxies (absorbance, fluorescence) to investigate DOM dynamics over spring neap tidal cycles in the main slough of Brown’s Island, a natural tidal wetland in the Delta. Descriptive statistics and multivariate classification of both the laboratory and in situ optical measurements (absorbance and EEMs) were obtained using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), principle component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to obtain useful high frequency optical parameters that describe DOM dynamics qualitatively and quantitatively. In this presentation we report findings from this study designed to derive and use optical indicators to continuously measure cumulative fluxes and chemical composition of wetland-derived DOM.",

            "abstract": "This paper will present the results of large-scale three-dimensional calculations simulating the hydrological-mechanical behavior of a CO2 injection reservoir and the resulting effects on wellbore casings and sealant repair materials. A critical aspect of designing effective wellbore seal repair materials is predicting thermo-mechanical perturbations in local stress that can compromise seal integrity. The DOE-NETL project “Wellbore Seal Repair Using Nanocomposite Materials,” is interested in the stress-strain history of abandoned wells, as well as changes in local pressure, stress, and temperature conditions that accompany carbon dioxide injection or brine extraction.\nTwo distinct computational models comprise the current modeling effort. The first is a field scale model that uses the stratigraphy, material properties, and injection history from a pilot CO2 injection operation in Cranfield, MS to develop a stress-strain history for wellbore locations from 100 to 400 meters from an injection well. The results from the field scale model are used as input to a more detailed model of a wellbore casing. The 3D wellbore model examines the impacts of various loading scenarios on a casing structure. This model has been developed in conjunction with bench-top experiments of an integrated seal system in an idealized scaled wellbore mock-up being used to test candidate seal repair materials. The results from these models will be used to estimate the necessary mechanical properties needed for a successful repair material.\nThis material is based upon work supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) under Grant Number DE-FE0009562.

            "abstract": "Understanding how complex terrain affects ecohydrological processes is increasingly important as we attempt to understand how water and carbon fluxes are integrated across relatively large domains. Spatial variations of incoming solar radiation are well understood and quantified, but the understanding their impacts on ecohydrologic processes is primarily qualitative. We provide detailed, extensive data quantifying the effects of contrasting slope/aspect on the soil physical environment and document the implications of those differences on ecohydrological processes. The study site, Johnston Draw, is located in the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed and CZO in southwest Idaho, USA (43° latitude). Johnston Draw flows over granitic bedrock nearly due east, resulting in steep (25 to 40°) side slopes oriented north-south. At the study elevation (1600 m) approximately 50% of the annual precipitation is snow. We measured meteorological variables, snow depth, soil water (SW) and temperature (ST) at three paired locations for two years. Each soil pair consisted of depth profiles from 5 cm to bedrock measured hourly which were supplemented with periodic extensive measurements. Hourly photographs were taken at two of the pairs for one year. Streamflow is monitored at the Johnston Draw outlet and precipitation was measured at stations at the topographic bottom and top of the watershed. Geophysical data were collected in a transect across both slopes. The ST was warmer all year on the south-facing slope, with a mean annual difference of 5°C. This ST difference is effectively equivalent to a 1000 m elevation difference in Reynolds Creek. Despite clear differences in evaporative demand and the timing of spring “green up”, the timing of summer SW decline is similar on both slopes. Deeper soil on north-facing slopes resulted in more plant available water and a longer growing season, which is reflected in the vegetation. Geophysical data indicate much deeper weathering on the north-facing slope. As a result of these varying conditions, there are effectively two different: hydrologic regimes, soil types, plant communities and weathering regimes within the single small watershed. These effects are predictably related to solar radiation, and so can potentially be incorporated in larger-scale models of water and carbon flux.",

Here we showed that such relation is highly hampered by internal variability associated with oceanic mesoscale turbulence in a high-resolution 1/54° idealized model of the North-West Atlantic. We used a seasonally-repeating atmospheric forcing such that there was no external source of interannual variability. At the scale of moorings, our experiment suggested that internal variability was responsible for interannual fluctuations of the subpolar phytoplankton bloom reaching 80% in amplitude and 2 weeks in timing. Over broader scales, the largest impact occurred in the subtropics with interannual variations of 20% in new production. The full strength of this variability could not be captured with the same model run at coarser resolution, suggesting that submesoscale resolving models are needed to fully disentangle the major drivers of biogeochemical variability at interannual time scales.",

            "abstract": "Composition discernment, fraction calculation and morphological analysis of a shallow core retrieved from Barrow, AK as part of the Next Generation Ecosystem Experiments in the Arctic (NGEE-Arctic) were conducted to give a quantitative description of the core. Imaging of the core was performed using a medical X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner, which gives a 3D image with a resolution of 0.195×0.195×0.625mm3. The core consists mainly of mineral, ice, organic matter and air and composition discernment and fraction calculation focus on the first three materials. Four scans with different energies were performed because materials with different density show different responses on scans with varying energies. A calibration curve showing the relationship between density and CT value was built by scanning standard materials having a wide range of density. CT value of the three compositions under four energies was determined by the calibration curve and the core scan. Composition fraction was calculated on the assumption that the core CT value is linearly proportional to the composition fraction and by solving linear least-squares problems with bounds. Comparison of the estimated and measured core CT value shows that the correlation coefficient is more than 0.99, indicating the accuracy of the calculation. Two regions with relatively high fraction of organic matter (10%) were distinguished, which are located at the top of the core and ice filled fractures at the bottom of the active layer. Morphological analysis was applied to the mineral and ice because of low fraction of organic matter. Three segmentations corresponding to ice-rich (with a density of 0.86 to 1.24 g/cm3), transition from ice to mineral (1.24 to 1.47 g/cm3) and mineral-rich (1.47 to 2.65 g/cm3) were applied to the core, and two area (area and area standard deviation) and three morphological (circulatory, roundness and rectangularity) parameters were analysed. By conducting Principle Component Analysis and Cluster Analysis, two principle components were distinguished from the five parameters, giving a quantitative description of the core. The study provides an innovative approach to quantitatively describe the arctic core, which may provide help in understanding geomorphological changes as a result of climate variation in the arctic.",

            "abstract": "In many geologic processes, hydrologic properties, such as porosity and permeability, may change due to various processes. Because these hydrologic properties and constitutive relationships are required in numerical models based on continuum approaches, a better understanding and accurate description of these changes is an issue critical for reducing uncertainties in large-scale numerical modeling. While much progress has been made to understand the effects of the physicochemical processes on hydrologic properties, the composition of the solid phase has received little attention. Natural rocks usually consist of multiple minerals with different dissolution rates. Significant difference in the dissolution rate will greatly affect the geometrical evolutions of the rocks which in turn affect the reactive transport processes and hydraulic properties.\nIn the present study, a pore-scale numerical model for reactive transport processes based on the Lattice Boltzmann method is used to study the dissolution-induced changes in hydrologic properties of a fractured medium and a porous medium. The solid phase of both media consists of two minerals, and a structure reconstruction method called quartet structure generation set is employed to generate the distributions of both minerals. Emphasis is put on the effects of undissolved minerals on the changes of permeability and porosity under different Peclet and Damkohler numbers. The simulation results show that porous layers formed by the undissolved mineral remain behind the dissolution reaction front. Due to the large flow resistance in these porous layers, the permeability increase is insignificant although the porosity increases by a large amount. Besides, due to the heterogeneous characteristics of the dissolution, the chemical, mechanical and hydraulic apertures are very different from each other. Further, simulations in complex porous structures demonstrate that the existence of the porous layers of the nonreactive mineral suppresses the wormholing phenomena observed in the dissolution of mono-mineralic rocks.",

            "abstract": "Many large earthquakes on natural faults are preceded by smaller events, often termed foreshocks, that occur close in time and space to the larger event that follows. Understanding the origin of such events is important for understanding earthquake physics. Unique laboratory experiments of earthquake nucleation in a meter-scale slab of granite (McLaskey and Kilgore, 2013; McLaskey et al., 2014) demonstrate that sample-scale nucleation processes are also accompanied by much smaller seismic events. One potential explanation for these foreshocks is that they occur on small asperities – or bumps – on the fault interface, which may also be the locations of smaller critical nucleation size.\nWe explore this possibility through 3D numerical simulations of a heterogeneous 2D fault embedded in a homogeneous elastic half-space, in an attempt to qualitatively reproduce the laboratory observations of foreshocks. In our model, the simulated fault interface is governed by rate-and-state friction with laboratory-relevant frictional properties, fault loading, and fault size. To create favorable locations for foreshocks, the fault surface heterogeneity is represented as patches of increased normal stress, decreased characteristic slip distance L, or both.\nOur simulation results indicate that one can create a rate-and-state model of the experimental observations. Models with a combination of higher normal stress and lower L at the patches are closest to matching the laboratory observations of foreshocks in moment magnitude, source size, and stress drop. In particular, we find that, when the local compression is increased, foreshocks can occur on patches that are smaller than theoretical critical nucleation size estimates. The additional inclusion of lower L for these patches helps to keep stress drops within the range observed in experiments, and is compatible with the asperity model of foreshock sources, since one would expect more compressed spots to be smoother (and hence have lower L). In this heterogeneous rate-and-state fault model, the foreshocks interact with each other and with the overall nucleation process through their postseismic slip. The interplay amongst foreshocks, and between foreshocks and the larger-scale nucleation process, is a topic of our future work.",

However it remains difficult to estimate its volume, and we still cannot answer the question; will there be enough for everybody? In many places of the world groundwater abstraction is unsustainable: more water is used than refilled, leading to decreasing river discharges and declining groundwater levels. It is predicted that for many regions in the world unsustainable water use will increase in the coming decades, due to rising human water use under a changing climate. It would not take long before water shortage causes widespread droughts and the first water war begins.\nImproving our knowledge about our hidden water is the first step to prevent such large water conflicts. The world’s largest aquifers are mapped, but these maps do not mention how much water these aquifers contain or how fast water levels decline. If we can add thickness and geohydrological information to these aquifer maps, we can estimate how much water is stored and its flow direction. Also, data on groundwater age and how fast the aquifer is refilled is needed to predict the impact of human water use and climate change on the groundwater resource. Ultimately, if we can provide this knowledge water conflicts will focus more on a fair distribution instead of absolute amounts of water.",

            "abstract": "To provide continuous flash flood situational awareness and to better differentiate severity of ongoing individual precipitation events, the National Weather Service Research Distributed Hydrologic Model (RDHM) is being implemented over Hawaii and Alaska. In the implementation process of RDHM, three gridded precipitation analyses are used as forcing. The first analysis is a radar only precipitation estimate derived from WSR-88D digital hybrid reflectivity, a Z-R relationship and aggregated into an hourly ¼ HRAP grid. The second analysis is derived from a rain gauge network and interpolated into an hourly ¼ HRAP grid using PRISM climatology. The third analysis is derived from a rain gauge network where rain gauges are assigned static pre-determined weights to derive a uniform mean areal precipitation that is applied over a catchment on a ¼ HRAP grid. To assess the effect of different QPE analyses on the accuracy of RDHM simulations and to potentially identify a preferred analysis for operational use, each QPE was used to force RDHM to simulate stream flow for 20 USGS peak flow events. An evaluation of the RDHM simulations was focused on peak flow magnitude, peak flow timing, and event volume accuracy to be most relevant for operational use. Results showed RDHM simulations based on the observed rain gauge amounts were more accurate in simulating peak flow magnitude and event volume relative to the radar derived analysis. However this result was not consistent for all 20 events nor was it consistent for a few of the rainfall events where an annual peak flow was recorded at more than one USGS gage. Implications of this indicate that a more robust QPE forcing with the inclusion of uncertainty derived from the three analyses may provide a better input for simulating extreme peak flow events.",

            "abstract": "Amplified warming and related environmental changes in the high latitudes have a complex geographic pattern, with the Western Antarctic Peninsula experiencing one of the fastest rates of recent warming globally. To better understand the response of terrestrial Antarctic ecosystems to polar change, we applied a paleoscience approach to organic soil profiles from 13 aerobic peatbank ecosystems on 7 islands along the peninsula from 67.6 to 64.2°S. Peatbank ecosystem ages were obtained by Radiocarbon measurements of organic matter from the base of these profiles and cluster in three groups: older than 1000 years old (as old as 2750 years old), 400-500 years old, and younger than 65 years with fixed bomb-spike carbon. Three of these peatbank profiles were studied in detail, and show growth rates over the last 65 years of ~2.5 mm yr‑1. This rate is faster than those observed during previous periods but is similar to other recent nearby studies that report recent growth rates of ~2.6 mm yr‑1. Organic carbon storage ranged from 6.1 to 21.3 kgC m-2. Values of moss bank organic matter δ13C show progressively more depleted δ13C values; in which depletion increases 3.0‰ over recent decades. Overall increase in source-independent discrimination is 1.7‰, consistent with published records from other locations and an increase in photosynthetic activity at the regional scale. Source-independent discrimination displays substantial variations corresponding negatively to variation of organic matter C:N values. Our results imply several recent changes in Antarctic peat forming ecosystem processes including formation of new moss banks, increased accumulation rates, and high variability in source-independent discrimination. These changes are complex but affected by contemporary climate changes of the region including increasing temperatures over the past century.",

            "abstract": "The role of volatiles in the petrogenesis of alkaline intra-plate magmas has been the subject of an increasing number of experimental studies. The study of naturally occurring rocks and their volatile contents is often complicated by syn- and post-eruptive degassing and alteration processes. Minerals that incorporate volatiles into their structure such as apatites are often more faithful recorders of the pre-eruptive volatile budget.\nThe Hegau volcanic field in Southwest Germany is part of the Central European Volcanic Province, lies around 60-70 km to the east of the Upper Rhine graben and of Miocene age. Three main lithological units can be distinguished (1) olivine melilites (2) phonolites and (3) the \"Deckentuff\" series referring to a series of diatreme-filling pipe breccias and lapilli tuff layers. Carbonatites occur subordinately in the Hegau province. Earlier radiometric age dating suggested distinct phases of volcanic activity of Deckentuffs, melilites and phonolites with little overlap, but new apatite fission-track and (U-Th)/He age data suggest a synchronous activity.\nApatite is an abundant accessory phase in the Deckentuff and phonolite series and we investigated its major, trace and volatile element composition by EPMA, SIMS and cathodoluminescence imaging. Pronounced core-rim zoning of apatite in places attests that diffusional equilibration was very limited and they likely retained their primary compositions. This allows us to trace the entire magmatic evolution of the Hegau province from its most primitive to most evolved products as well as resolve it in time by combining age dating with compositional analysis.\nApatite compositions fall along the OH-F join with low Cl-contents (<0.5 wt%). Volatile contents (Cl, OH, S) are highest in most primitive compositions and decrease with further evolution while F increases. Multiple magmatic cycles can be discerned with a general trend to the more evolved phonolite compositions toward the end of volcanic activity.",

            "abstract": "The 2012 Mw8.6 East Indian Ocean earthquake ruptured multiple planes in an orthogonal conjugate fault system, about 100 km west of the Sumatra subduction zone. It is the largest intra-plate strike-slip event ever recorded. We processed time series of more than twenty continuous GPS stations in the region between the Andaman Islands and southern Sumatra. These GPS stations recorded up to ~30 cm coseismic displacements and up to ~10 cm cumulative postseismic displacements in the first year after the earthquake. The significant postseismic deformation provides a unique opportunity to better constrain the viscosity structure in the Indian Ocean asthenosphere across the subduction slab, to test the contribution of afterslip following the earthquake, and to better understand the interaction between the intra-plate fault system and subduction zone systems. We develop three-dimensional viscoelastic finite element models of the 2012 Sumatra earthquake to study these problems. In our model, we assume that the upper mantle is characterized by a bi-viscous Burgers rheology that is able to describe slow long-term deformation as well as very rapid short-term transient deformation. Our preliminary model indicates that the transient and steady-state viscosities of the oceanic mantle are about one order of magnitude higher than that of the mantle wedge whose long-term viscosity of ~10^{19} Pa s was estimated in a number of studies of deformation following recent subduction zone earthquakes in 2004, 2005 and 2007 along the Sumatra subduction zone.",

            "abstract": "When did the continents form? Peaks in the distributions of zircon U-Pb ages around 2.7, 1.9 and 1.2 Ga have been used as evidence for increased crustal growth rates at these times (growth pulses). The pulses appear linked to the formation of super-continents, with fundamental implications for the thermal evolution of the mantle. However, the age peaks could also be produced by variations in preservation/destruction rates, in which case the implications for the deep Earth are less direct.\nHere I use the novel approach of examining U-Pb zircon age spectra as a function of the age of the sediment in which the zircons are preserved. This produces time-lapse sequences of zircon age distributions, and presumably, crustal evolution. The database [1] is large enough (n>200,000) that time-lapse sequences can be constructed for each continent. To my knowledge, this approach has only been applied to the Australian zircon record [2].\nThe results are quite clear (Figure 1; circles are positions of peaks (x-axis) in detrital zircon U-Pb age spectra in different age sediments (y-axis), size of circle is proportional to the height of the peak). There are no major zircon U-Pb age peaks in the ranges 2.2-2.4 Ga and 1.3-1.6 Ga in any sediment of any age on any continent. While some crust was produced at these times, there is no evidence in the zircon record that substantial amounts of crust of these ages ever existed, suggesting that the troughs in the age spectra are due to substantial decreases in (though not cessation of) crustal production.\nIn contrast, U-Pb age peaks between 2.5 and 2.7 Ga appear in sediments immediately after these times and persist in subsequent sedimentary records. The peak heights decrease steadily through time, indicating that crustal destruction is a significant process in modifying the zircon record, but is not responsible for producing the peaks. The same pattern is seen for age peaks at 1.6-2.1 and 1.0-1.3 Ga. Comparing the time-lapse results with Hf isotopes in zircons and Os isotopic ages of lithospheric mantle suggests continental growth largely occurred in pulses between 2.8 and 1 Ga. Subsequent to 1 Ga, the zircon record seems to be dominated by crustal reworking.\n[1] Voice et al (2011) J Geology 119:109-126. [2] Hawkesworth et al (2010) J Geol Soc Lon 167: 229-248.",

            "abstract": "Elves are optical emissions in the D-region ionosphere that are a result of collisional heating from the intense lightning electromagnetic pulse (EMP). The shape of elves is determined by the EMP radiation pattern at D-region altitudes, which is in turn controlled by the geometry and current propagation properties of the return stroke channel. In particular, numerical simulation of the EMP-ionosphere interaction shows a strong relationship between the elve \"hole\" radius and the current return stroke speed. During the summer of 2013, hundreds of elves were observed from Langmuir Laboratory, in New Mexico, with the PIPER high-speed photometer. Of these, 55 had an appropriate viewing geometry in which the elve hole is observable and is not corrupted by cloud flashes or sprites. An “emission profile”, characterizing the elve emissions versus radius and time, is fit to each of these events using a constrained least squares reconstruction, allowing easy extraction of the elve hole radius. Using these measured radii in conjunction with the numerical EMP model, we perform Bayesian inference to estimate the distribution of return stroke speeds. The MTLL engineering model is assumed for the current propagation with reasonable priors for the parameters. The results show a maximum a posteriori probability return stroke speed estimate of 0.64c for elve producing lightning.",

            "abstract": "This work is a continuation of the development and analysis of the Global ecosystem Production in Space and Time (GePiSaT) model. The development of the GePiSaT model was prompted due to inconsistencies found amongst the more complex global vegetation and biogeochemical models that are focused more on prediction rather than explanation. GePiSaT takes a simplistic approach to modelling terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) by making the best use of in situ observations while defensibly representing the principal ecophysiological processes that govern GPP, including (1) the eddy-covariance method of partitioning net CO2 and solar radiative fluxes into monthly quantities of GPP and respiration and (2) the optimality principle of vegetation minimizing the summed costs associated with maintaining carbon fixation and water transport capabilities. The free and fair-use FLUXNET archive provided the half-hourly in situ observations and were screened for outliers using Peirce's criterion. The limitations of the observational data (i.e., missing or invalid data points) were overcome by means of gap-filling based on modelled half-hourly extraterrestrial solar radiation with daily magnitudes scaled to match WATCH global modelled data products of shortwave downwelling solar radiation and converted to photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). Monthly totals of GPP and PPFD, together with MODIS-based estimates of fractionally absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR), are used in a new theoretically-based light-use efficiency model. Estimates have been made for the intrinsic quantum efficiency and carbon to water cost ratio at individual flux sites to the global terrestrial scale. Analyses of meteorological variables and soil moisture conditions have revealed that vapor pressure deficit and moisture availability (i.e., the Cramer-Prentice bioclimatic moisture index) are important for explaining the deviation from the expected in the light-use efficiency. The new insights on modelling GPP from first principles are useful in developing next-generation vegetation and land-surface models for the characterization and prediction of future climate change impacts.",

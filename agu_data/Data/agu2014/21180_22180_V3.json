            "abstract": "Water scarcity due to climate changes and growing human population is a major concern for the world. Adaptation and mitigation strategies should be developed for water scarcity in the future. Previous studies assessed the future water availability by hard technology (e.g., reservoirs, reclaimed and desalinated water plants) as adaptation strategies. On the other hand, soft path such as water law and policy would also be important for adaptation strategies. Water transfers is reallocation of water among water users. For example, distribution of the amount of available water is often heterogeneous especially during drought periods. If water transfers are permitted in these areas, water can be moved from surplus areas/sections to critical need areas/sections. There are several studies which describe the water transfer at the local scales (i.e., water bank in California), however the factors that determined the establishment of water transfer are not clear. If we can detect the factors, it could be used to estimate in which areas the water transfer would come into existence. This in turn would reduce the water stress.\nHere, we focus on historical interaction between human activity and water environments. Generally, rules of water use are developed by repeated discussion among water users. The frequency of these discussions would be related with their land use, frequency of drought and water resource sizes. For example, people in rice crop area need to discuss about water allocation compared to wheat crop area. Therefore, we examine the relationship between the permission of water transfer and factors such as water environment and human activity in the world.",

            "abstract": "Floods due to gradual dam breach can lead to devastating disasters with tremendous loss of life and property. Hence it is important to identify the potential risk areas for natural hazard problem such as dam failure. A numerical modeling approach is often used to build a flood hazard map caused by dam failure. The two primary tasks in the analysis of a dam breach are the prediction of the reservoir outflow hydrograph and the routing of the hydrograph through the downstream valley. The hydrograph to be routed downstream may be prescribed, and parametric models could be used to build a outflow hydrograph once breach parameters capturing breach formation and progress are specified. Even though breach growth is one of the most important parameter in building the reservoir outflow hydrograph, observations are rarely available. In the mean while lake level data is often measured during the dam failure on the real time basis and they may capture the characteristics of breach formation and progress. Thus a simple method is developed to reproduce breach formation. The breach formation is retrieved from lake level data as a function of time during dam failure event. The new method uses an optimization scheme as a primary tool. Because observation for breach formation doesn’t exist, it is hard to validate the performance of the new method. Alternatively the retrieved breach formation curve is linked with a parametric dam failure model to give outflow hydrograph. Then FLO-2D is run to route the outflow hydrograph through the downstream valley for the test site. To validate the new method the simulation of FLO-2D is relatively compared with the on-site investigation for the inundation zone. The new method is promising in that it provides reasonable accuracy in the test site.\nKeywords: Dam failure, Natural hazard, Breach, Hydrograph\nAcknowledgement\nThis research was supported by a grant (13SCIPS01) from Smart Civil Infrastructure Research Program funded by Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport(MOLIT) of Korea government and Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement(KAIA).\n ",

            "abstract": "To estimate the role of sediments controlling the water quality, many studies have adopted nutrient leaching experiments. However, the experiments were mostly performed under air-open condition, which is different from the actual condition at the bottom of fairly stagnant water body. Therefore, the results may not properly reflect the capability of the sediments supplying the nutrients to the water column. In this study, nutrient leaching experiments were conducted using various sediment samples under two different oxygen supplying conditions: one open and the other closed to the air. For this study, 5 sediment samples were collected from lakes and rivers around Kunsan, Korea. Air-closed leaching experiments were carried out using conventional BOD glass bottles (355 mL) without any head spaces. All the experiments were performed at a solid:solution ratio of 1:7.3. Each reactor was incubated at 25 ℃ for 72 hours or 120 hours. The solution was analyzed for pH, DO, Eh, NO3-N, NH4-N, and PO4-P after the incubation. Silt+clay fraction, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and COD of the sediments showed close correlations with each other. Air-closed condition showed much higher leached concentrations for NH4-N and PO4-P (up to 60 times) than the air-open condition and the concentrations increased with the incubation time. However, the differences were very small in the experiments using sandy sediments (<0.13 mg/L and < 50 ug/L for NH4 and PO4 concentrations, respectively). In general, the leached NH4 and PO4 concentrations from the air-open experiments were not correlated well with the fine fractions due to nitrification and suppression of Fe-oxide reduction in aerobic condition, respectively. Because of this reason, some air-open results showed NO3-N concentrations higher than the concentrations obtained from the air-closed experiments. The experiments closed to air showed NO3-N concentrations substantially decreasing with the incubation time due to denitrification. During the stratified period, it is well known that the lake bottoms are generally under anoxic condition and, thus, the air-closed leaching may reflect the actual nutrient releasing from sediments more closely.",

            "abstract": "Decadal variability of the subtropical gyre in the South Pacific is investigated with satellite altimeter data from 1992 to 2013 and Argo data from 2004 to 2013. Sea surface height in most region of the South Pacific exhibits an increasing trend, and the significant signal is mainly located in the western part. Argo data shows that sea surface height increase north of 30ºS is primarily caused by thermohaline variation in the upper 500 m, while that south of 30ºS is determined by the variation of the whole water column from 0 to 1800 m, with signals below 1000 m accounting for about 50 % of the total variance. Correspondingly, the subtropical gyre in the South Pacific is strengthened. The South Equatorial Current transport increased by 20-30% from 2004 to 2013, and the transport of the deep gyre at 1000 m increased by 10-30%. Further analysis shows these variations are mainly caused by the wind stress curl variation at basin scale, which is closely related to climate modes in the South Pacific.",

            "abstract": "The West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is one of the Earth’s regions with a fastest warming signal since the 1950’s with an increase of over +2.5 ºC in MAAT. Significant changes have been reported for glaciers, ice-shelves, sea-ice and also for the permafrost environment. Mapping and monitoring the ice-free areas of the WAP has been until recently limited by the available aerial photo surveys, but also by the scarce high resolution satellite imagery (e.g. QuickBird, WorldView, etc.) that are seriously constrained by the high cloudiness of the region. Recent developments in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV’s), which have seen significant technological advances and price reduction in the last few years, allow for its systematical use for mapping and monitoring in remote environments. In the framework of projects PERMANTAR-3 (PTDC/AAG-GLO/3908/2012 - FCT) and 3DAntártida (Ciência Viva), we complement traditional terrain surveying and mapping, satellite remote sensing (SAR and optical) and D-GPS deformation monitoring, with the application of an UAV. In this communication, we present the results from the application of a Sensefly ebee UAV in mapping the vegetation and geomorphological processes (e.g. sorted circles), as well as for digital elevation model generation in a test site in Barton Pen., King George Isl.. The UAV is a lightweight (ci. 700g) aircraft, with a 96 cm wingspan, which is portable and easy to transport. It allows for up to 40 min flight time, with application of RGB or NIR cameras. We have tested the ebee successfully with winds up to 10 m/s and obtained aerial photos with a ground resolution of 4 cm/pixel. The digital orthophotomaps, high resolution DEM’s together with field observations have allowed for deriving geomorphological maps with unprecedented detail and accuracy, providing new insight into the controls on the spatial distribution of geomorphological processes. The talk will focus on the first results from the field surveys of February and March 2014 and will also include some test data from the mountains of serra da Estrela, Portugal. New surveying is planned for the season of 2014-15 with mapping to be conducted in Livingston and King George Islands.",

Based on this grain size data, we produced typical three kinds of sandy sediments as standard sediments, i.e., (1) silty sand, (2) sandy silt, and (3) clayey silt, respectively.

            "abstract": "A reliable mean sea surface (MSS) is essential to derive a good mean dynamic topography (MDT) and for the estimation of short and long-term changes in the sea surface. The lack of satellite radar altimetry observations above 82 degrees latitude means that existing mean sea surface models have been unreliable in the Arctic Ocean.\nWe here present the latest DTU mean sea surface and mean dynamic topography models combining conventional altimetry with retracked CryoSat-2 data to improve the reliability in the Arctic Ocean. For the derivation of a mean dynamic topography the ESA GOCE derived geoid model have been used to constrain the longer wavelength.\nWe present the retracking of C2 SAR data using various retrackes and how we have been able to combine data from various retrackers under various sea ice conditions.\nDTU13MSS and DTU13MDT are the newest state of the art global high-resolution models including CryoSat-2 data to extend the satellite radar altimetry coverage up to 88 degrees latitude and through combination with a GOCE geoid model completes coverage all the way to the North Pole. Furthermore the SAR and SARin capability of CryoSat-2 dramatically increases the amount of useable sea surface returns in sea-ice covered areas compared to conventional radar altimeters like ENVISAT and ERS-1/2. With the inclusion of CryoSat-2 data the new mean sea surface is improved by more than 20 cm above 82 degrees latitude compared with the previous generation of mean sea surfaces.",

In this pop-up I will show how the combination of hard and soft data in drought research has improved our knowledge of drought in cold climates and the impacts of drought on agriculture. We used data from historical archives and modern drought impact databases and used this information side-by-side with hydrometeorological observations and outcomes of large-scale hydrological models.

            "abstract": "Type III radio bursts are produced near the local electron plasma frequency and/or near its harmonic by fast electrons ejected from the solar active regions and moving through the corona and solar wind. These bursts have dynamic spectra with frequency rapidly falling with time. This paper presents two new methods developed to detect type III bursts automatically in the data from High Frequency Receiver (HFR) of the STEREO/WAVES radio instrument onboard the STEREO spacecraft. The first technique is applicable to the low-frequency band (HFR-1: 125 kHz to 1.975 MHz) only. This technique can possibly be implemented in onboard satellite software aimed at preliminary detection of bursts and identification of time intervals with relatively high solar activity. In the second technique the bursts are detected in both the low-frequency band and the high-frequency band (HFR-2: 2.025 MHz to 16.025 MHz), with the computational burden being higher by 1 order of magnitude as compared with that for the first technique. Preliminary tests of the method show that for the first technique the pobability to detect is quite high, Pd L = 72% ± 3%. The performance of the second technique is considerably higher, Pd L+H = 81%±1%, while the number of false alarms does not exceed 10% for one daily spectrum.",

            "abstract": "Tsunamigenic deposits preserved in the offshore, shallow (<30msl) uppershelf environment has been suggested as a possible resource for improving the understanding of tsunami sedimentological dynamics and producing a more detailed paleotsunami record. On one hand, this zone is advantageous due to its relatively lower susceptibility to anthropogenic disturbance and certain types of erosion. However, the added complications of collection difficulties, marine dynamics and disturbance, and heterogeneity may prove this archive less desirable and accessible. Recent results of a multitude of offshore shallow coring efforts in the eastern Mediterranean and northern Red Sea will be presented and discussed with regard to the question of the usefulness, limitations, and advantages of these offshore records. Broadly summarized, like their terrestrial counterparts, the offshore archive requires extensive attention to the local background conditions and characteristics of the surrounding contributing sources in order to recognize, interpret, and mine the information contained within them. While some tsunami indicator criteria remain the ‘rule’, their expression and appearance inter and intrasite can vary considerably and therefore the ability to recognize them challenging. Ultimately, as more results are shared from recent modern analogues and compared with sedimentological anomalies with possible tsunamigenic characteristics within the offshore sedimentological record, the better and more precisely these deposits will be defined and interpreted.",

            "abstract": "The melting curve of Ni has been determined to 125 GPa using laser-heated diamond anvil cell (LH-DAC) experiments and two melting criteria: the appearance of liquid diffuse scattering (LDS) during in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and simultaneous plateaux in temperature vs. laser power functions [1]. Our melting curve (Fig. 1) is in good agreement with most theoretical studies [e.g. 2] and the available shock wave data (Fig. 2). It is, however, dramatically steeper than the previous off-line LH-DAC studies in which the determination of melting was based on the visual observation of motion aided by the laser speckle method [e.g. 3]. We estimate the melting point of Ni at the inner-core boundary (ICB; 330 GPa) to be 5800±700 K (2σ), ~2500 K higher than the estimate based on the laser speckle method [3] and within error of Fe (6230±500 K) as determined in a similar in situ LH-DAC study [4]. We find that laser speckle based melting curves coincide with the onset of rapid sub-solidus recrystallization, suggesting that visual observations of motion may have misinterpreted dynamic recrystallization as melt convection. Our new melting curve suggests that the reduction in ICB temperature due to the alloying of Ni with Fe is likely to be significantly smaller than would be expected had the earlier experimental Ni melting studies been correct.\nWe have applied our methodology to a range of other transition metals (Mo, Ti, V, Cu). In the case of Mo, Ti and V the melting curves are in good agreement with the shock compression and theoretical melting studies but hotter and steeper than those based on the laser speckle method, as with Ni. Cu is an exception in which all studies agree, including those employing the laser speckle method. These results go a long way toward resolving the the long-standing controversy over the phase diagrams of the transition metals as determined from static LH-DAC studies on the one hand, and theoretical and dynamic compression studies on the other.\n[1] Lord et al.

            "abstract": "Fault and fractures properties are responsible of a large part of the fluid transfer properties and associated seismicity, at all scales. Multiple reactivations can deeply modify the initial fracture properties all along the rocks diagenetical history, leading to complex alternate periods of fractures sealing and seismic instability. For instance, each reactivation step may be associated with cementation/dissolution processes that can be traced through combined geophysical and geochemical analyses.\nFor that purpose, we studied a parallelepiped (2.5x1.5x1.1m) carbonate quarry block with a detailed structural and diagenetical characterization (fractures, karsts and stylolites digitalization; thin section and plug porosity). The block is affected by two en-échelon fracture clusters, the first one being simply formed in mode 1 and cemented, the second one being polyphased (multiple reactivations, cementation and karstification phases). We performed 1298 acoustic P-wave velocity measurements on a vertical cross section along with geochemical analyses of carbon and oxygen isotopes ratios on fracture fillings/cements.\nPreliminary key results show that the fracture diagenetical evolution induces an anisotropic Vp variation regarding the dip angle of the raypaths:\n- Fracture initial cementation, likely related to meteoric diagenesis during eogenetic event, leads to the obliteration of facies initial acoustic heterogeneity.\n- Multiple reactivations phases relate both to burial mesogenetic geochemical signature leading to angular anisotropy, Vp crossing the reactivated fractures being in average 500m/s lower compared to non-reactivated fractures.\n- Fracture meteoric karstification leads to a dramatic decrease of Vp, but slightly increases the overall Vp anisotropy.\nThus, ultrasonic anisotropy evolution may help detecting the degree of fracture sealing which is a crucial point in better understanding fluid natural and induced movements in the sub-surface fracture networks.",

Correctly modeling this response on a continental scale will require high-resolution modeling of the coupled ice-ocean system. We describe the computational and modeling challenges in our simulations of the full Southern Ocean coupled to a continental-scale Antarctic ice sheet model at unprecedented spatial resolutions (0.1 degree for the ocean model and adaptive mesh refinement down to 500m in the ice sheet model).\nThe POPSICLES model couples the POP2x ocean model, a modified version of the Parallel Ocean Program (Smith and Gent, 2002), with the BISICLES ice-sheet model (Cornford et al., 2012) using a synchronous offline-coupling scheme. Part of the PISCEES SciDAC project and built on the Chombo framework, BISICLES makes use of adaptive mesh refinement to fully resolve dynamically-important regions like grounding lines and employs a momentum balance similar to the vertically-integrated formulation of Schoof and Hindmarsh (2009). Results of BISICLES simulations have compared favorably to comparable simulations with a Stokes momentum balance in both idealized tests like MISMIP3D (Pattyn et al., 2013) and realistic configurations (Favier et al. 2014). POP2x includes sub-ice-shelf circulation using partial top cells (Losch, 2008) and boundary layer physics following Holland and Jenkins (1999), Jenkins (2001), and Jenkins et al. (2010). Standalone POP2x output compares well with standard ice-ocean test cases (e.g., ISOMIP; Losch, 2008) and other continental-scale simulations and melt-rate observations (Kimura et al., 2013; Rignot et al., 2013). For the POPSICLES Antarctic-Southern Ocean simulations, ice sheet and ocean models communicate at one-month coupling intervals.",

            "abstract": "The last millennia are suitable to understand the variability arising from external forcings and internal climate variability. Numerous studies reconstructed global and/or Northern Hemisphere temperature variability and agree well with the simulation for the period. When comparing the spatial distributions of simulated and reconstructed field, however, there are some discrepancies, which stem from the uncertainties of forcings, reconstructions and GCMs. To validate the model we directly compare the simulated isotopes with that of climate proxies in this study. For that purpose we implemented stable water isotopes (HDO, and H218O) into MIROC5A, which consists of atmospheric and land surface components of MIROC5 developed jointly by University of Tokyo, NIES, and JAMSTEC. The implementation manner of isotopes is based on the previous version of isotope enabled MIROC [Kurita et al., 2011] for its atmospheric component and on iso-MATSIRO [Yoshimura et al., 2006] for its land surface component. Using the model, time slice experiments for warm climate anomaly (WCA; 950-1250) and little ice age (LIA; 1450-1850) were conducted. The simulations were forced by simulated sea surface temperature and sea ice from the last millennium experiments of CMIP5-PMIP3. For the other boundary conditions (e.g. orbital parameters, concentrations of GHGs, solar irradiance, etc.), we follow the protocol of CMIP5-PMIP3. Both simulations are 30 years long with a spin-up of one year. At the presentation, the comparison results of simulated isotopes with that of proxies are presented.",

            "abstract": "Subduction zone earthquakes are often discussed as potential triggers for the sudden release of hydrocarbons from marine sediments. However, a causal link that goes beyond theoretical considerations is difficult to establish because of the inaccessibility of offshore epicentral areas, and the infrequent occurrence of large earthquakes. The Central Chile margin is known to host marine gas hydrates and gas-bearing sediments, and for some locations methane seeps have been reported. In February 2010 a 500 km long stretch of this margin ruptured during the Mw 8.8 Maule earthquake. In order to investigate the impact of the Maule earthquake on hydrocarbon seepage we combine geophysical (seismic reflection and Parasound profiles, swath bathymetry), modeling (Coulomb stress estimates) geochemical (methane, sulfate, sulfide, alkalinity) and visual (ROV surveys) data and observations from the rupture area. Essential parts of the data base were collected on R/V SONNE Cruise 210 six months after the earthquake. Results from Coulomb stress calculations suggest that co-seismic slip on the subduction interface was sufficient to cause extensional fractures and normal faults at the seafloor, as spectacularly documented in some ROV videos. First results from geochemical analyses indicate highest methane concentrations in the water column as well has high sulfide concentrations in surface sediments in the vicinity of these fractures. This, together with the consideration that in a forearc setting under horizontal extension only small overpressures in the forearc cover sediments are needed to cause natural hydrofracturing, indicates that seismic shaking during the 2010 Maule earthquake may have increased or even triggered hydrocarbon seepage offshore Central Chile.",

To this end, 42 cases equally distributed under the six most frequent upper air synoptic conditions, which are associated with convective activity in the region of interest, were utilized considering two different soil moisture scenarios. In the first scenario, the model was initialized with the surface soil moisture of the ECMWF analysis data that usually does not take into account the modification of soil moisture due to agricultural activity in the area of interest. In the second scenario, the soil moisture in the upper soil layers of the study area was modified to the field capacity for the irrigated cropland. Three model domains, covering Europe, the Mediterranean Sea and northern Africa (d01), the wider area of Greece (d02) and central Greece – Thessaly region (d03) are used at horizontal grid-spacings of 15km, 5km and 1km respectively. The model numerical results indicate a strong dependence of convective spatiotemporal characteristics from the soil moisture difference between the two scenarios.   ",

In this study, we use the Receiver Functions technique that constrain the presence of impedance contrasts at depth, caused by lithology changes, and seismic anisotropy, possibly related to fluid-filled cracks or alignment of orientated mineral grains. We present some examples from broadband seismic stations located in the Vienna basin, on the horst structures and in the deep depocenters, which characterize the sedimentary basin.\nPreliminary analysis of the high frequency (4Hz) RF data-set, show the presence of two close impedance contrasts, which presumably are related to the occurence of a thick sedimentary layer overlying a thinner limestone layer. Seismic anisotropy is recognized around the interface between sediments and limestones; the anisotropy is NE directed reflecting the NE alignment of the strike-slip fault system, which characterizes the area. The comparison of passive seismology with direct exploration improves the knowledge of the subsurface and adds new constraints on its geodynamical interpretation.",

            "abstract": "Changes in stable carbon isotopes (δ13C) recorded in benthic foraminiferal calcite reflect that of the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) of ambient seawater, and thus are used to reconstruct past changes in water mass mixing. Records of benthic foraminiferal δ13C from the Atlantic Ocean have revealed the development of a sharp vertical δ13C gradient between 2300-2500m water depth during successive glacial periods throughout the Late Quaternary, with extremely negative δ13C values recorded below this depth. It had been hypothesised that this gradient resulted from an increased stratification of water masses within the glacial Atlantic Ocean, and that these extreme δ13C values originated in the Southern Ocean. However the mechanisms behind the formation of this gradient and extreme δ13C depletion have remained unclear. This is in part due to the poor preservation of calcareous microfossils in the corrosive waters below 2500-3000m found in the Southern Ocean, which hampers our understanding of this key region.\nHere we present a unique new δ13C deep water record measured on benthic foraminifera (Cibicidoides spp.) from a sediment core recovered from 2100m water depth in the Amundsen Sea, south-eastern Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. The site is bathed in Lower Circumpolar Deep Water (LCDW) today, and combined palaeomagnetic and oxygen isotope stratigraphy show that the sediments continuously span at least the last 890 ka. A comparison of this new δ13C data with other LCDW records from ODP Sites 1089/1090 in the South Atlantic and ODP Site 1123 in the Southwest Pacific demonstrate a clear spatial gradient in circum-Antarctic LCDW during glacial periods. The pool of extremely depleted glacial deep marine δ13C is restricted to the Atlantic Sector of the Southern Ocean, with increasingly positive δ13C values found in the Southwest Pacific and the south-eastern Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. This implies that the δ13C depletion in the deep glacial Atlantic was sourced in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, and remained limited to this sector. This finding indicates either increased supply of relatively more positive δ13C deep waters or increased vertical mixing in the Indian and Pacific sectors of the glacial Southern Ocean.",

            "abstract": "We present results of detailed partitioning of soil organic carbon (SOC) and phytomass carbon (PC) from two study sites in Siberia. The study sites in the Tundra (Kytalyk) and the Taiga (Spasskaya Pad) reflect two contrasting environments in the continuous permafrost zone. In total 57 individual field sites (24 and 33 per study site respectively) have have been sampled for SOC and PC along transects cutting across different land covers. In Kytalyk the sampling depth for the soil pedons was 1 m depth. In Spasskaya Pad where the active layer was significantly deeper, we aimed for 2 m depth or tried to include at least the top of the permafrost. Here the average depth of soil profiles was 152 cm. PC was sampled from 1x1 m ground coverage plots. In Spasskaya Pad tree phytomass was also estimated on a 5x5 m plot. The SOC storage was calculated separately for the intervals 0-30 cm, 30-100 cm and 100-200 cm (the latter only for Spasskaya Pad), as well as for organic layer vs. mineral soil, active layer vs. permafrost and for cryoturbated soil horizons. Landscape partitioning was performed by thematic up-scaling using a vegetation based land cover classification of very high resolution (2x2 m) satellite imagery.\nNon-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) was used to explore the relationship of SOC with PC and different soil and permafrost related variables. The results show that the different land cover classes can be considered distinct storages of SOC, but that PC is not significantly related to total SOC storage. At both study sites the 30-100 cm SOC storage is more important for the total SOC storage than the 0-30 cm interval, and large portions of the total SOC are stored in the permafrost. The largest contribution comes from wetland pedons, but highly cryoturbated individual non-wetland pedons can match these. In Kytalyk the landscape partitioning of SOC mostly follows large scale geomorphological features, while in Spasskaya pad forest type also has a large influence.",

            "abstract": "Effects of forest fires and implications are one of the most important natural disasters all over the world. Statistical data observed that forest fires had a variable structure in the last century in Turkey, but correspondingly the population growth amount of forest fires and burn area increase widely in recent years. Depending on this, erosion, landslides, desertification and mass loss come into existence. In addition; after forest fires, renewal of forests and vegetation are very important for land management. Classic methods used for detection of burn area and severity requires a long and challenging process due to time and cost factors. Thanks to advanced techniques used in the field of Remote Sensing, burn area and severity can be determined with high detail and precision.\nThe purpose of this study based on blending MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectradiometer) satellite images and spatial autocorrelation techniques together, thus detect burn area and severity absolutely. In this context, spatial autocorrelation statistics like Moran’s I and Get is-Ord Local Gi indexes were used to measure and analyze to burned area characteristics. Prefire and postfire satellite images were used to determine fire severity depending on spectral indexes corresponding to biomass loss and carbon emissivity intensities.\nSatellite images have used for identification of fire damages and risks in terms of fire management for a long time. This study was performed using prefire and postfire satellite images and spatial autocorrelation techniques to determining and analyzing forest fires in Antalya, Turkey region which serious fires occurred. In this context, this approach enables the characterization of distinctive texture of burned area and helps forecasting more precisely. Finally, it is observed that mapping of burned area and severity could be performed from local scale to national scale.\n Key Words: Spatial autocorrelation, MODIS, Fire, Burn Severity",

            "abstract": "In the solar wind turbulent cascade, the energy partition between fluid and kinetic degrees of freedom, in the vicinity of plasma characteristic scales, i.e. ion and electron Larmor radius and inertial lengths, is still under debate. In a neighborhood of the ion scales, it has been observed that the spectral shape changes and fluctuations become more compressible. Nowadays, a huge scientific effort is directed to the comprehension of the link between macroscopic and microscopic scales and to disclose the nature of compressive fluctuations, meaning that if space plasma turbulence is a mixture of quasi-linear waves (as whistler or kinetic Alfvèn waves) or if turbulence is strong with formation of coherent structures responsible for dissipation.\nHere we present an automatic method to identify compressible coherent structures around the ion spectral break, using Morlet wavelet decomposition of magnetic signal from Cluster spacecraft and reconstruction of magnetic fluctuations in a selected scale range. Different kind of coherent structures have been detected: from soliton-like one-dimensional structures to current sheet- or wave-like two-dimensional structures. Using a multi-satellite analysis, in order to characterize 3D geometry and propagation in plasma rest frame, we recover that these structures propagate quasi-perpendicular to the mean magnetic field, with finite velocity. Moreover, without using the Taylor hypothesis, the spatial scales of coherent structures have been estimated.\nOur observations in the solar wind can provide constraints on theoretical modeling of small scale turbulence and dissipation in collisionless magnetized plasmas.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen isotopic compositions of upper Permian to lowermost Triassic rocks were analyzed at Chaotian, Sichuan, China, to clarify changes in the oceanic N cycle around the Permian-Triassic boundary (P-TB) including the entire Changhsingian (Late Late Permian) prior to the extinction. The analyzed ca. 40 m thick interval across the P-TB at Chaotian consists of three stratigraphic units: the upper Wujiaping Formation, the Dalong Formation, and the lowermost Feixianguan Formation, in ascending order. The upper Wujiaping Formation is composed of dark gray limestone with diverse shallow-marine fossils, such as calcareous algae, deposited on the shallow shelf. In contrast, the overlying Dalong Formation, ca. 25 m thick, is mainly composed of thinly bedded black mudstone and siliceous mudstone containing abundant radiolarians, deposited on the relatively deep slope/basin. Absence of bioturbation, substantially high TOC contents, and abundant occurrence of pyrite framboids in the Dalong Formation indicate deposition under anoxic conditions. The lowermost Feixianguan Formation is composed of thinly bedded gray marl and micritic limestone with minor fossils, deposited on the relatively shallow slope. δ15N values are in positive values around +1 to +2‰ in the upper Wujiaping Formation implying denitrification and/or anammox in the ocean. δ15N values gradually decrease to -1‰ in the lower Dalong Formation and are consistently low (around 0‰) in the middle Dalong to lowermost Feixianguan Formation. No clear δ15N shift is recognized across the extinction horizon. The consistently low δ15N values suggest the enhanced N fixation in the ocean during the Changhsingian at Chaotian. Composite profiles based on previous and the present studies demonstrate the substantial δ15N variation on a global scale in the late Permian to earliest Triassic; a systematic δ15N difference by low and high latitudes is particularly clarified. Although the enhanced N fixation throughout the Changhsingian at Chaotian was likely a regional event in northwestern South China, the composite δ15N profiles imply that the sea area in which fixed N is depleted has gradually developed worldwide in the Changhsingian, possibly acting as a prolonged stress to the shallow-marine biota.",

It is mandatory to monitor this part of the earth’s energy balance, and thus gain insights on the state and variability of the climate system. In addition, data sets of the surface solar radiation have received increased attention over the recent years as an important source of information for the planning of solar energy applications.\nThe EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) is deriving surface solar radiation from geostationary and polar-orbiting satellite instruments. While CM SAF is focusing on the generation of high-quality long-term climate data records, also operationally data is provided in short time latency within 8 weeks.\nHere we present SARAH (Solar Surface Radiation Dataset – Heliosat), i.e. the new CM SAF Solar Surface Radiation data set based on Meteosat satellite observations. SARAH provides instantaneous, daily- and monthly-averaged data of the effective cloud albedo (CAL), the direct normalized solar radiation (DNI) and the solar irradiance (SIS) from 1983 to 2013 for the full view of the Meteosat satellite (i.e, Europe, Africa, parts of South America, and the Atlantic ocean). The data sets are generated with a high spatial resolution of 0.05 deg allowing for detailed regional studies, and are available in netcdf-format at no cost without restrictions at www.cmsaf.eu.\nWe provide an overview of the data sets, including a validation against reference measurements from the BSRN and GEBA surface station networks.",

A measure has been proposed to quantify this influence, called the fraction of attributable risk (FAR). FAR estimates are either model-based or solely based on statistical analyses of observed time series. In both cases untested assumptions underly the methodologies. In model-based estimates, climate models are used to estimate the probability of the event in a world that could have been without anthropogenic climate change with assumptions about the world that could have been given the lack of the detailed state of the climate system in the pre-industrial era. These estimates are affected by model error. In observation-based estimates assumptions are made about the cause of observed changes and the stationarity of statistical relations.\nWe test the different approaches to calculate the FAR in a perfect model context, where we regard an ensemble of 16 simulations with the EC-Earth climate model under the RCP8.5 scenario as truth. Proposed methods to calculate the FAR are benchmarked against the true FAR value estimated directly from the ensemble.",

In the present, a lot of N-S striking active faults dominated by dip-slip are found along the backbone range in the E-W compressive stress perpendicular to the arc. Some large (~M7) crustal earthquakes of reverse faulting has occurred under the backbone range in the last century. On the other hand, it is known that the NE Japan arc used to be pulled away from the Asian continent by back arc rifting in the middle Miocene. Consequently many normal faults along the arc and some strike slip faults oblique to the arc had been initially formed in this stage. Some of the ancient normal faults are seemed to reactivate as reverse faults in the present E-W compression.\nWe carried out a dense arrayed micro-earthquake observation with 30 temporary stations in the Ou backbone range during 2011-2012. A seismic tomography analysis using the acquired data with the surrounding seismic network clearly shows heterogeneity of the velocity structure. The results indicate 1) a remarkable heterogeneity (discontinuity) in NW-SE direction along the strike slip faults oblique to the arc, 2) an apparent change of the distribution and the activity of the present reverse faults across the discontinuity, 3) a good correspondence between the end of the source area of the large earthquakes in this century and the discontinuity. We discuss a possibility that the present fault behavior is controlled by the heterogeneous structure formed by the ancient faults.",

Paleomagnetic study of the properties of these sediments provide a detailed trace the changes in the paleoenvironment. However, there are factors such as landslides, earthquakes, the presence of gas in the sediments affecting the disturbing sediment stratification. Seismic profiling allows to investigate in detail the bottom relief and get information about the thickness and structure of the deposits, which makes this method ideally suited for determining the configuration of the lake basin and the overlying lake sediment stratigraphy. Most seismic studies have concentrated on large and deep lakes containing a thick sedimentary sequence, but small and shallow lakes containing a thinner sedimentary column located in key geographic locations and geological settings can also provide a valuable record of Holocene history. Seimic data is crucial when choosing the optimal location of core sampling. Thus, continuous seismic profiling should be used regularly before coring lake sediments for the reconstruction of paleoclimate. We have carried out seismic profiling on lakes Balkhash (Kazakhstan), Yarovoye, Beloe, Aslykul and Chebarkul (Russia).

Therefore it understands various natural phenomena to study physical properties of water. Oodo et al study physical properties of water confined in silica gel [1]. They indicate that melting point of water confined in silica gel decrease with decreasing pore size of silica gel. Also in case that pore size is less than 2 nm, water confined in silica gel is unfreezing water at low temperature. It is considered that effect of pore size prevent crystal growth of water. Therefore we are interested in water confined in clay minerals. Clay minerals have a number of water conditions. Also it is thought that water confined in clay minerals show different physical behavior to exist the domain where change with various effect. Therefore we studied a thermal properties and phase behavior of absorption water in clay minerals. In addition, we analyzed the changes in the thermal behavior of absorption water due to the effect of earth pressure that was an environmental factor in the ground.\n[1] Oodo & Fujimori, J.

It is reported lately that AGWs(atmospheric gravity waves) generated by meteorological phenomena in the troposphere such as typhoons and tornadoes, large earthquakes and volcanic eruptions propagate to the mesosphere and thermosphere. We observe them in various forms(e.g. airglows, ionospheric disturbances and TEC variations). We are proposing the following model. AGWs caused by atmospheric disturbances in the troposphere propagate to the ionospheric E-layer, drive dynamo action and generate field-aligned currents. The satellites observe magnetic fluctuations above the ionosphere. In this presentation, we focus on cases of tropical cyclone(hurricanes in North America, typhoons in North-West Pacific).",

            "abstract": "Acceleration of solar energetic particles (SEPs) is one of the key problems to be tackled by both Solar Probe Plus and Solar Orbiter missions as they will carry out in-situ measurements closer to the Sun than ever before. The data obtained will be used to validate numerical models of the acceleration processes. A suitable approach in this, especially in the case of shock-accelerated SEPs, is Monte Carlo simulations. Being based on consideration of individual particles interacting with the turbulence, Monte Carlo simulation models can provide detailed information on particle and turbulence distributions in the vicinity of the shock. However, the existing Monte Carlo models, relying on the quasi-linear approximation for interactions of particles with Alfvénic turbulence, often use a simplified way (neglect the pitch-angle dependence in the resonance conditions) to model the interactions. Earlier we showed that the effect of retaining the pitch-angle dependence on the Alfvén wave growth is important for self-consistent modeling of the acceleration process and developed a more accurate Monte Carlo treatment. In this presentation, we will mainly focus on the results of our Monte Carlo simulations on energy spectra of particles observed in large gradual SEP events. We have found that often-observed broken power-law spectra can result from stochastic re-acceleration of energetic (shock-accelerated) protons by enhanced Alfvénic turbulence in the shock's downstream region. Specifically, the resulting spectral form (power law or broken power law) is determined by the ratio of the energy density of shock-accelerated protons to the Alfvén wave energy density in the shock’s downstream region. Additionally, we will show results of our recent simulations of the foreshock evolution and compare them with the results obtained with other shock acceleration models. Finally, we will discuss implications of our results for the upcoming Solar Probe Plus and Solar Orbiter missions.",

            "abstract": "Freeze/thaw (F/T) related surface processes in the Arctic are important as they bracket negative and positive modes in the flux of CO2 and CH4 between the surface and atmosphere. The Carbon in the Arctic Vulnerability Experiment (CARVE) monitors carbon gas cycling in Alaskan using aircraft-deployed gas sampling instruments along with remote sensing observations of the land surface condition. A nadir-pointed, forward looking infrared (FLIR) imager mounted on the CARVE aircraft is used to measure upwelling mid-infrared spectral radiance at 3-5 microns. The FLIR instrument was operated during the spring, summer and fall seasons of 2013 and 2014 during clear sky conditions and targeting ecosystem components affecting the carbon cycle. The instantaneous field of view (IFOV) of the FLIR instrument allows for a resolution of ~36 cm from a height of 500 m. This high resolution data allow for the discrimination of individual landscape components such as soil, vegetation and surface water features in the image footprint. We assess the effectiveness of the FLIR thermal images in monitoring thawing and inundation processes of individual ecosystem components of importance in biogeochemical cycling. We also observe how these individual components scale using coarse resolution satellite observations of land surface temperature (LST) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Freeze/thaw state determined from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR2) on JAXA’s Shizuku (GCOM-W1) satellite.\nPortions of the work were carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract with the National Aeronautic and Space Administration.",

            "abstract": "Coignimbrite deposits form as fine-grained ash (< 250 microns) is lofted into the atmosphere from the top of pyroclastic density currents, producing convective plumes. Such material can be transported over continental sized areas and the fine-grained nature of this ash means that it poses great hazard, in respect to health, infrastructure and air traffic. To date, few coignimbrite deposits have been studied in detail, mainly due to their poor preservation potential, and difficulty distinguishing these deposits from Plinian deposits. As such, there is little in the published record regarding the physical characteristics of coignimbrite deposits.\nDeposits from Lago Grande di Monticchio, a maar lake 120 km east of the Campanian Volcanic Zone, Italy were analysed for this study. These lake sediments contain more than 340 distinct tephra layers, of which more than 300 are thought to have originated from the Campanian region. The physical characteristics of deposits from eruptions from within the past 50 kyrs are studied with particular emphasis placed on those with a known pyroclastic density current phase. Results show that in most cases, stratigraphy is comparable to proximal stratigraphy, and in the case of the Campanian Ignimbrite (Phlegrean Fields, 39.3 ka) and Monte Epomeo Green Tuff (Ischia, 55 ka) particularly, the coignimbrite contribution is easily identified. These coignimbrite deposits are composed of glass shards, with very small lithic and expanded pumice contents. Grainsize data from these coignimbrite events show remarkably similar characteristics, typically described by a very fine-grained mode (~50 microns), and poor sorting. This fine grain size implicates aggregation as the dominant process by which this ash is deposited. Similar trends are identified in the literature, for different types and scales of eruptions indicating the grainsize of these deposits is controlled by current dynamics rather than primary eruptive conditions at the vent. The results highlight the importance of lacustrine environments for deciphering eruption dynamics, specifically those from coignimbrite forming events. In addition, the distinct difference in grainsize trends between Plinian and coignimbrite events highlights the need to model coignimbrite events and ash dispersal separately from Plinian events.",

Using a subset of CMIP5 models that provide anthropogenic aerosol only experiments, we identify several regions where there is a correlation between water cycle changes in historical all forcing experiments, and those in experiments forced only by changes in anthropogenic aerosol. Analysis of shortwave and latent heat fluxes identifies regions that are collocated with the major aerosol emission regions, and areas with persistent stratocumulus coverage. However, analysis of near-surface temperature suggests that areas without local aerosol perturbations may also be sensitive to anthropogenic aerosol forcing.\nWe quantify the role of aerosol in climate change in these regions for a larger set of CMIP5 models. In regions where aerosol is shown to have a strong influence on regional climate, we quantify the inter-model diversity in both the aerosol perturbation, and the climate response, and suggest physical mechanisms for the differences.",

            "abstract": "The exposed Glarus thrust displays mid-crustal deformation with tens of kilometers of displacement on an ultra-thin layer, the principal slip zone (PSZ) as shown in Figure 1. Geological observations indicate that this structure resulted from repeated stick-slip events in the presence of highly over-pressured fluids. Here we show that the major characteristics of the Glarus thrust movement (localization, periodicity and evidence of pressurized fluids) can be reconciled by the coupling of two processes, namely shear heating and fluid release by carbonate decomposition. During this coupling, slow ductile creep deformation raises the temperature through shear heating and ultimately activates chemical decomposition of carbonates. The subsequent release of highly over-pressurized fluids forms and lubricates the PSZ, allowing a ductile fault to move tens of kilometers on millimeter-thick bands in episodic stick-slip events. This model identifies carbonate decomposition as a key process for motion on the Glarus thrust and explains the source of over-pressured fluids accessing the PSZ.",

The TERN AusCover Facility comprises a national expert network that provides remote sensing data such as satellite-derive biophysical products, advanced remote sensing products and ground-validation information free and online to the research community.\nTERN and AusCover have collected in situ data for a number of 5 km x 5 km supersites from nearly every state and territory in Australia. These data include spectrophotometer data, sun photometer and ozonometer data, airborne and terrestrial LIDAR data and airborne hyperspectral data.\nAs part of the AusCover facility and in conjunction with Landgate, Western Australia, Curtin University has modified the atmospheric correction and surface reflectance processing scheme from Landgate to process 12 extra MODIS bands to surface reflectance, thus providing 19 bands. This processing scheme uses the Simple Method for Atmospheric Correction (SMAC) to produce reflectance data.\nUntil recently, only the first 7 MODIS bands were available with the MODIS institutional algorithm for surface reflectance, MOD09, but this has altered to now also provide 9 extra bands. MOD09 is based around 6S to produce reflectance data.\nThis case study makes use of hyperspectral airborne data captured over the Credo TERN supersite to compare the surface reflectance products from MOD09 and the SMAC-based 19-band reflectance process.\nThis work required validating the airborne data against a set in situ reflectance measurements of large calibration targets. The validated airborne data were resampled spatially and spectrally to MODIS bands and both the airborne and MODIS data were mapped to the same spatial grid.\nDirect pixel comparisons have been made between the airborne data and the two algorithms, and between the algorithms themselves.\nThe algorithms show good agreement to the airborne data and to each other with RMS errors less than 0.025 and r2 values greater than 0.95. This would indicate both algorithms are viable methods to produce surface reflectance data over the Credo supersite and provides a roadmap to extend the comparison to the other AusCover sites.",

Developers have created tools for data management, collaborative writing, social networking, data access and visualization, project management and many more; either for free or as paid premium services with additional or extended features. Scientists have begun to incorporate tools that fit their needs into their daily work. To satisfy specialized needs, some cloud applications specifically address the needs of scientists for sharing research data, literature search, laboratory documentation, or data visualization. Cloud services may vary in extent, user coverage, and inter-service integration and are also at risk of being abandonend or changed by the service providers making changes to their business model, or leaving the field entirely.\nWithin the project Academic Enterprise Cloud we examine cloud based services that support the research lifecycle, using feature models to describe key properties in the areas of infrastructure and service provision, compliance to legal regulations, and data curation. Emphasis is put on the term Enterprise as to establish an academic cloud service provider infrastructure that satisfies demands of the research community through continious provision across the whole cloud stack. This could enable the research community to be independent from service providers regarding changes to terms of service and ensuring full control of its extent and usage. This shift towards a self-empowered scientific cloud provider infrastructure and its community raises implications about feasability of provision and overall costs. Legal aspects and licensing issues have to be considered, when moving data into cloud services, especially when personal data is involved.\nEducating researchers about cloud based tools is important to help in the transition towards effective and safe use. Scientists can benefit from the provision of standard services, like weblog and website creation, virtual machine deployments, and groupware provision using cloud based app store-like portals. And, other than in an industrial environment, researchers will want to keep their existing user profile when moving from one institution to another.",

            "abstract": "The rapidly changing climate and environment in polar regions in the 20th and 21st centuries are well documented by scientists. Yet, this understanding is not well disseminated to students and the general public because the language of science is often inaccessible to these groups. To increase participation in science about the changing Polar regions, we organized a series of interdisciplinary events at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, in 2013/14 called “Polar Perspectives on Art and Science”. This series brought five artist/scholars to Rutgers and reached a broad audience of students, faculty and the general public. Accompanying this series were two high-profile events. First, the Zimmerli Art Museum’s academic-year-long exhibit, “Glacial Perspectives,” displayed paintings and photographs by Diane Burko documenting rapidly changing glacial, and polar landscapes. Second, the “Let Us Talk About Water” event included a screening of the documentary “Chasing Ice” followed by a panel discussion at the Rutgers Cinema. Financial support was provided by Zimmerli Art Museum’s Andrew W. Mellon Endowment Fund, Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrological Sciences, Inc., Rutgers Centers for Global Advancement and International Affairs, GAIA, and many other Rutgers institutes and departments. Student feedback on the “Polar Perspectives on Science and Art” suggest that art was effective in enhancing engagement and understanding of contemporary polar change. Furthermore, the many events created a forum for reoccurring and stimulating discussions among people with their academic home in widely different disciplines, including humanities, and physical and social sciences.",

During Expedition 348, the drilling vessel Chikyu advanced the ultra-deep riser hole at Site C0002, located 80 km offshore of the Kii Peninsula, from a depth of 860 meters below sea floor (mbsf) to 3058.5 mbsf, the world record for the deepest scientific ocean drilling, and cased it for future deepening. The drilling operation successfully obtained data on formation physical properties from logging while drilling (LWD) tools, as well as from lithological analyses of cuttings and core from the interior of the active accretionary prism at the Nankai Trough. IODP Site C0002 is the currently only borehole to access the deep interior of an active convergent margin.\nPreliminary scientific results of Expedition 348 are as follows: (1) Fine-grained turbiditic mudstones with coarser silty and sandy interbeds, exhibiting steep dips (between ~60 and 90 degrees) are predominant in the prism down to ~3000 mbsf. The biostratigraphic age of the sediments in the lowermost part of the hole is thought to be 9–11 Ma, with an assumed age of accretion of 3–5 Ma. (2) Slickenlined surfaces, deformation bands and mineral veins are present throughout the drilled interval, while well-developed scaly clay fabrics are increasingly observed below ~2200 mbsf. A substantial fault zone with well-developed foliation was successfully cored from the deep interior of the prism at ~2205 mbsf. (3) Porosity generally decreases from ~60% to ~20% from the seafloor to 3000 mbsf. However, physical properties including grain density, electrical conductivity and P-wave velocity suggest fairly homogeneous properties in the interior of the prism between ~2000 and 3000 mbsf. (4) Mud gas analysis during the riser drilling indicates that a source of methane gas shifts from microbial origin to thermogenic at around 2325 mbsf. (5) The maximum horizontal principal stress at ~2200 mbsf is in the NE-SW direction. The inner wedge at ~ 2000 mbsf is currently in a strike-slip stress regime.",

            "abstract": "Since 1950, observations show a robust negative trend of the seasonal rainfall associated with the South Asian summer monsoon over India coinciding with a continuous decrease in surface solar radiation (“dimming”) over South Asia due to an increase of local aerosol emissions. On the intraseasonal timescale the summer monsoon fluctuates between periods of enhanced and reduced rainfall. The frequency of occurrence of these active and breaks monsoon phases affects directly the seasonal monsoon rainfall.\nThis study investigates the regional pattern and changes of the South Asian monsoon for the period 1979-2012 using the regional atmospheric model HIRHAM5 with a horizontal resolution of 0.25° forced at the lateral and lower boundaries with ERA-Interim reanalysis data. Despite the dry bias in the mean summer monsoon rainfall over the Indian landmass, the simulated temperature and atmospheric circulation patterns are in agreement with the ERA-Interim reanalysis indicating a realistic representation of important dynamical summer monsoon features. In addition, mechanisms which controls active and break phases within the summer monsoon season are analyzed using daily outgoing longwave radiation model data as an identification tool of monsoon breaks as proposed by Krishnan et al. (2000). Model results reveal an increasing trend of the cumulative monsoon break days of around 1.4 days per year during the last 30 years. The possible link between this increasing of cumulative monsoon break days and the observed decrease of seasonal South Asian monsoon rainfall will be the scope of further investigations.",

This teamwork is integral to the success of real-time science results and often allows for unmanned operations which are both cost-effective and safer. The CPS program utilizes a variety of communications networks, services and technologies to support researchers and instruments throughout the Arctic, including Iridium, VSAT, Inmarsat BGAN, HughesNet, TeleGreenland, radios, and personal locator beacons. Program-wide IT and communications limitations are due to the broad categories of bandwidth, availability, and power. At these sites it is essential to conserve bandwidth and power through using efficient software, coding and scheduling techniques. There are interesting new products and services on the horizon that the program may be able to take advantage of in the future such as Iridium NEXT, Inmarsat Xpress, and Omnispace mobile satellite services. Additionally, there are engineering and computer software opportunities to develop more efficient products.

There are, however, large temporal and spatial variations in the CMB in this region, due to interannual changes in winter snow accumulation and summer melt. Previous mass-balance modelling efforts have mainly focused on individual glaciers or ice caps, with atmospheric forcing data obtained from either point measurements or coarse-resolution reanalyses. Here we present an 11-year simulation of the climatic mass balance of all Svalbard glaciers, performed with the coupled atmosphere and glacier model, WRF-CMB. The atmospheric component is the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF), which is used to dynamically downscale ERA-Interim reanalysis data to a resolution of 3 km for direct forcing of the simulation of glaciated grid cells by the CMB model. The results are evaluated with in situ mass-balance and meteorological observations from Austfonna, Northeast Svalbard, which covers an area of ~8000 km2and is the largest ice cap in the archipelago, as well as from glaciers in the Ny-Ålesund region, western Svalbard.",

            "abstract": "The change of atmospheric circulation over the North Hemisphere from decade to decade during the XX century until recent decade was studied. The Fourier series expansion of fields of pressure at the middle level of the troposphere is used in the analysis of change of atmospheric circulation in time and space. The shift of the atmospheric circulation from decade to decade at ± 20 degrees from its position of the 1930-1939 was found. The period of shift between the east (+20 degrees) and the west (-20 degrees) positions is about 50-60 years.\nThe displacement of circulation to the west corresponds to the cold winters over the Northern Hemisphere (as it was at the middle of the 20th century) and displacement to the east corresponds to the warming (as it was at the end of the century). The displacement of the large-scale circulation of atmosphere to the east at the end of the century over the Northern Hemisphere corresponds to the warming. In the beginning of the twenty-first century large-scale atmospheric circulation again shifted to the west to the circulation with the colder winters. That is the reason for appearance of the frosty winters in the recent years. Continuing displacement of the circulation over the North Hemisphere to the west direction will correspond to the colder winters in future.\nThe influence of new factors of the climate change of the hemisphere is also shown. They are the “bands of heat” (elongated positive anomaly of surface temperature) which have appeared on the background of the general atmospheric circulation in last decades. They have the permanent geographical position during the month and more. These “bands of heat” differ from moving warm air flows from the south and also they caused increasing of temperature in the troposphere. The synoptic conditions along the bands form the dangerous weather events.",

            "abstract": "Shear zones channelize fluid flow in the Earth’s crust. A number of mechanisms have been suggested to control fluid migration pathways in upper- and mid-crustal shear zones, amongst them creep cavitation, which is well-known from deforming metals and ceramics. However, little is known on deep crustal fluid migration and on how fluids are channelized and distributed in actively deforming lower crustal shear zones.\nThis study investigates the deformation mechanisms, fluid-rock interaction, and development of porosity in a monzonite ultramylonite from Lofoten, northern Norway. The rock was deformed under lower crustal conditions (T=700-730° C, P=0.65-0.8 GPa). The ultramylonite consists of feldspathic layers and of domains of amphibole + quartz + calcite, which represent the products of hydration reactions of magmatic clinopyroxene. The average grain size in both domains is <25 μm. Microstructural observations and EBSD analysis are consistent with diffusion creep as the dominant deformation mechanism in both domains. In feldspathic layers, isolated quartz grains without a crystallographic preferred orientation occur along C’-type shear bands. All microstructures suggest that quartz precipitated in cavities. The orientation of such quartz bands overlaps with the preferred orientation of pores in the ultramylonites, as evidenced from synchrotron X-ray microtomography. Such C’-type shear bands are interpreted as high-strain cavitation bands resulting from diffusion creep deformation associated with grain boundary sliding. Mass-balance calculation indicates a 2% volume increase during the protolith-ultramylonite transformation. The volume increase is consistent with a synkinematic formation of cavities.\nThus, this study presents clear evidence that high-strain cavitation bands may control deep crustal porosity and fluid flow. Nucleation of new phases in cavitation bands inhibits grain growth and enhances the activity of grain-size sensitive creep, thereby maintaining strain and fluid flow localized in the fine-grained polymineralic ultramylonites.",

            "abstract": "Melt inclusions hosted in olivines from single Icelandic eruptions of basalt have highly variable compositions, particularly in terms of their incompatible element concentrations, concentration ratios and Pb-isotopes. This compositional diversity reflects variation in the composition of mantle melts supplied to individual volcanic plumbing systems. The variance of inclusion compositions decreases as the forsterite content of the host olivine decreases: a relationship that is readily understood in terms of concurrent mixing and crystallisation of primitive melts. The availability of a large number of melt inclusion analyses from Icelandic olivines (>500) allows for robust quantification of the relative rates of melt cooling and passive tracer mixing in the lower crustal chambers where inclusion entrapment occurred. This coupling of cooling and mixing is likely to reflect convection in the melt layer of the chambers. The fact that the Icelandic observations preserve a record of both mixing and cooling indicates that the characteristic timescales of these processes are similar. A simple 1D model of convection in a basaltic sill was developed, with the cooling either controlled by temperature dependence of viscosity of the melt or by the rate of conduction of heat through the rocks of the chamber roof. The timescales of cooling of melt and mixing of passive tracers are proportional to different powers of the Rayleigh number of the sill. Therefore, models that match the Icelandic observations involve sills with a surprisingly small range of thicknesses: the model timescales of mixing and cooling are similar only if the thickness of the sill is <10 m. These sill thicknesses are similar to those proposed for the lower oceanic crust based on observations from ophiolites, and may indicate that small sills play a dominant role in the evolution of basaltic melts.",

            "abstract": "We present an InSAR analysis of slow moving landslide in the Northern Appennines, Italy, and assess the dependencies on the choice of DEM. In recent years, advanced processing techniques for synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) have been applied to measure slope movements. The persistent scatterers (PS-InSAR) approach is probably the most widely used and some codes are now available in the public domain. The Stanford method of Persistent Scatterers (StamPS) has been successfully used to analyze landslide areas. One problematic step in the processing chain is the choice of an external DEM that is used to model and remove the topographic phase in a series of interferograms in order to obtain the phase contribution caused by surface deformation. The choice is not trivial, because the PS InSAR results differ significantly in terms of PS identification, positioning, and the resulting deformation signal. We use four different DEMs to process a set of 18 ASAR (Envisat) scenes over a mountain area (~350 km2) of the Northern Appennines of Italy, using StamPS. Slow-moving landslides control the evolution of the landscape and cover approximately 30% of the territory. Our focus in this presentation is to evaluate the influence of DEM resolution and accuracy by comparing PS-InSAR results. On an areal basis, we perform a statistical analysis of displacement time-series to make the comparison. We also consider two case studies to illustrate the differences in terms of PS identification, number and estimated displacements. It is clearly shown that DEM accuracy positively influences the number of PS, while line-of-sight rates differ from case to case and can result in deformation signals that are difficult to interpret. We also take advantage of statistical tools to analyze the obtained time-series datasets for the whole study area. Results indicate differences in the style and amount of displacement that can be related to the accuracy of the employed DEM.",

            "abstract": "Decisions resulting in land use change (LUC) or land management change (LMC) rarely consider the changes to surface biophysical properties that lead to immediate land-atmosphere feedbacks and subsequent local- to regional-scale climate changes. This is likely because the sign and magnitude of the various feedback mechanisms depend largely on a multitude of highly site-specific meteorological, eco-physiological, structural, and topographic factors, making them difficult to quantify in the absence of sophisticated models with high spatial and temporal resolution.\nIn a world increasingly dependent on biomass (and thus land) resources for energy and materials, it is unacceptable to continue ignoring important biogeophysical factors linked to land use activities in climate impact assessment studies. Although a number of useful land-atmosphere impact assessment methodologies and metrics have been proposed in recent years, they are rarely applied in the decision making process. Over the last 10-15 years, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has emerged as a prominent decision-support tool that relies on well-established IPCC climate metrics, yet land-atmosphere climate metrics are rarely applied.\nHere, we present a review of the literature enveloping methods and metrics for quantifying or characterizing climate change impacts in terrestrial ecosystems. We highlight their merits and discuss practical limitations with respect to their integration into the LCA framework. We conclude by proposing some solutions for overcoming the integration barrier and suggest some practical ways forward for both climate modelers/metric developers and LCA practitioners.",

            "abstract": "The meridional overturning circulation (MOC) is a planetary-scale oceanic flow that is of direct importance to the climate system because it transports heat, salt and nutrients to high latitudes and regulates the exchange of CO2 with the atmosphere. The Atlantic Ocean plays a strong role in the modern day MOC however, it is unclear what role it may have played during extreme climate conditions such as those found in the early Eocene ‘greenhouse’.\nIn order to resolve the Atlantic’s role in the MOC during the early/middle Eocene, we present a multi-proxy approach to investigate changes in ocean circulation, water mass geometry, sediment supply to the deep oceans and the physical strength of deep waters from four different IODP drill sites. Neodymium isotopes (εNd), REE profiles and cerium anomalies measured in fossilised fish teeth help to characterise geochemical changes to water masses throughout the Atlantic whilst bulk sediment εNd and XRF-core scan data documents changes in sediment supply to the region. Sortable silt data provides a physical constraint on the strength of deep-water movements during the extreme climatic conditions of the early Eocene. We utilise expanded and continuous sequences from two sites in the North west Atlantic spanning the early to middle Eocene recently recovered on IODP Exp. 342 (1403, 1409) that are located on the Newfoundland Ridge, directly in the flow path of today’s Deep Western Boundary Current. We also present data from equatorial Demerara Rise (IODP site 1258) and from further north at the mouth of the Labrador Sea (ODP Site 647).",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have pointed out that the upward mass transport due to heating is important for the thermospheric mass density anomalies in the cusp. The cusp is not a single area of anomalies, and there is another neutral mass density enhancement on the nightside. Density depletions also occur on the dawn- and duskside, as has been shown by the CHAMP satellite observations. In the present study, in order to understand the mechanism of the enhancement or depletion of the neutral mass density, we have studied the effect of ion drag due to ionospheric convection, which can give momentum to the neutral air over the whole area of the polar thermosphere. We have used a three-dimensional numerical model in which heat transfer from plasmas to neurals is not included. The result of the model calculations shows that the neutral mass density is enhanced at the cusp. Besides the cusp enhancement, another enhancement occurs on the sunlit side of the terminator. This terminator enhancement then spreads to the nightside due to thermal expansion, so that density enhancements can occur on the nightside. On the dawn- and duskside the ion drag drives neutral wind circulations, which make depletions in those regions. These dawn- and duskside depletions would make the cusp enhancement more prominent.",

            "abstract": "Mesoscale eddies are one of the major conduit for nutrient transport into the upper ocean which may subsequently induce significant biogeochemical responses. It has been hypothesized that cyclonic eddies may stimulate export productivity whilst anticyclonic eddies would not induce any significant biological responses. Here, we showed complex submesoscale circulations associated with the eddy in one case study that examined 234Th-based particle fluxes associated with three coherent anticyclonic eddies in the largest marginal sea of the Pacific, northern South China Sea (SCS). Notably, there occurred dynamic interactions at submesoscales which might induce advection into the eddy core from the edge where the deficit of 234Th was elevated owing to higher particle production and export likely stimulated by the upwelling at the edges. Indeed, by integrating the entire anticyclonic eddy system, the export level was 1.6-fold higher compared to that from the reference sites. Submescale variability was also shown to be important in another case study associated with two cyclonic eddies in western SCS. We concluded thus that consideration of submesoscale interactions within eddy systems are essential in estimating export fluxes using 234Th deficit, and resolving the 3-D circulation structure of an eddy system is ideal.",

            "abstract": "Interoperable data management platforms play an increasing role in the advancement of knowledge and technology in many scientific disciplines. Through high quality services they support the establishment of efficient and innovative research environments.\nWell-designed research environments can facilitate the sustainable utilization, exchange, and re-use of scientific data and functionality by using standardized community models. Together with innovative 3D/4D visualization, these concepts provide added value in improving scientific knowledge-gain, even across the boundaries of disciplines.\nA project benefiting from the added value is the Integrated Plate boundary Observatory in Chile (IPOC). IPOC is a European-South American network to study earthquakes and deformation at the Chilean continental margin and to monitor the plate boundary system for capturing an anticipated great earthquake in a seismic gap. In contrast to conventional observatories that monitor individual signals only, IPOC captures a large range of different processes through various observation methods (e.g., seismographs, GPS, magneto-telluric sensors, creep-meter, accelerometer, InSAR).\nFor IPOC a conceptual design has been devised that comprises an architectural blueprint for a data management platform based on common and standardized data models, protocols, and encodings as well as on an exclusive use of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) including visualization components. Following the principles of event-driven service-oriented architectures, the design enables novel processes by sharing and re-using functionality and information on the basis of innovative data mining and data fusion technologies. This platform can help to improve the understanding of the physical processes underlying plate deformations as well as the natural hazards induced by them.\nThrough the use of standards, this blueprint can not only be facilitated for other plate observing systems (e.g., the European Plate Observing System EPOS), it also supports integrated approaches to include sensor networks that provide complementary processes for dynamic monitoring. Moreover, the integration of such observatories into superordinate research infrastructures (federation of virtual observatories) will be enabled.",

We compute atmospheric loading effects using surface pressure provided by the latest reanalysis (ERA interim) and the operational models of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). A model describing the ocean response to the pressure forcing is required:\n- The inverted barometer (IB) hypothesis is usually chosen, but this approximation is valid for periods exceeding typically a week.\n- However at higher frequencies, the dynamics of the ocean response cannot be neglected. We use a global barotropic ocean model forced by air pressure and winds, namely the Toulouse Unstructured Grid Ocean model (TUGO-m).\nThe latest (ECMWF+TUGO-m) computation is incompatible with non-tidal ocean loading estimates with bottom pressure computed with classical baroclinic ocean GCMs (such as ECCO) forced by atmospheric winds, heat and fresh-water fluxes.\nWe combine the atmospheric loading with the induced oceanic loading estimated from the two models filtering out short and long periods of the ECMWF+IB and EMCWF+TUGO-m loading time series, respectively, and summing the resulting time series; then non-tidal oceanic loading effects can be included in the modeling.\nAs hydrological loading effects also cause a large part of the seasonal displacements, we add to our loading estimates the modeled displacements using different global hydrology models.\nWe compare our loading models to a global set of reprocessed GPS observations, and investigate how they can be reduced with the different hypotheses, for example IB vs TUGO-m, looking at different frequency bands (from seasonal to a few days).",

            "abstract": "The generation of reliable precipitation products that explicitly account for spatial and temporal structures of precipitation events requires a combination of data with a variety of error structures and temporal resolutions. In-situ measurements are relatively accurate, but available only at sparse and irregularly distributed locations, whereas remote measurements cover areas but suffer from spatially and temporally inhomogeneous systematic errors. Besides gauge measurements are available on coarser spatial and temporal resolution in contrast to remote sensing measurements which are given on a fine spatial and temporal resolution. In our study we use precipitation rates from the composit of two X-band radars in Bonn and Jülich in Germany. Our aim is to formulate a statistical space-time model that aggregates and disaggregates precipitation rates from radar and gauge observations. We model a Gaussian random field as underlying process, where we face the task of dealing with a large non-Gaussian data set. To start the analysis of the unadjusted radar rainfall rates, we follow the work of D. Allcroft and C. Glasbey (2003) and transform the data to a truncated Gaussian distribution. The advantage of the latent variable approach is that it takes account of the occurence of rainfall and the intensity using a single process. We proceed by estimating the empirical correlation from these transformed values with maximum likelihood methods and fit a parametric correlation function that gives rise to a Gaussian random field. Since the transformation gives censored values to dry locations, we simulate values for this area that lie below some threshold and extend the Gaussian field to the whole domain. In order to merge gauge and radar data for precipitation, we first aggregate the data to a scale on which the comparison is reasonable and then disaggregate again back to smaller desirable scales. The disaggregation step consists of calculating the difference between radar aggregate and small scale measurements and the difference between gauge aggregate and derived small scale measurements. Then the spatial structure of the radar anomalies is used to simulate the gauge anomalies on the whole field. In the end we add the simulation to a combined estimator of the radar and gauge aggregates and obtain the small scale merging product.",

            "abstract": "Hydrologic connectivity within headwater fluvial networks depends largely on subsurface patterns of moisture. Dynamic subsurface properties that control those patterns can vary widely and are poorly constrained in many systems. However, subsurface conditions change seasonally in a predictable way in catchments underlain by permafrost due to increasing thaw throughout the summer season, and those changes can be systematically measured. Zero-order linear flow features known as water tracks are found in upland permafrost hillslopes and occupy up to 35% of the landscape. Water tracks often connect to downstream fluvial systems via subsurface pathways, but those connections are poorly understood. We present data from six water tracks underlain by permafrost in northern Alaska. We improve our understanding of water tracks and their connections to downstream fluvial systems in two ways. First, we compare the fraction of snow and rain comprising flows in water tracks and the downstream systems to which they connect, and we discuss the resulting constraints on biogeochemical fluxes in these systems. Second, we examine the subsurface controls on water track connectivity patterns by characterizing the water tracks’ thermal signatures. We demonstrate that a shallow unfrozen layer permits subsurface flow to continue below a surface frozen layer for up to 6 months after air temperatures drop below freezing, enhancing fall and winter water track downstream connectivity. Because winter air temperatures are projected to increase and become more variable, we examine the role of freeze-thaw events on hydrologic connectivity: some water tracks are less responsive to rapid air temperature changes than surrounding hillslopes. At these sites, soils inside the water tracks remain frozen and impermeable for ~10 more days each year and cycle through fewer freeze-thaw cycles than the same soils outside water tracks. Some shallow soils outside some water tracks freeze and thaw up to 3-fold more times per year than water track soils. We discuss how thermal responses of water tracks influence downstream biogeochemical fluxes in the dynamic freeze-thaw periods.",

As part of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Com-Part project, emissions from a diesel engine dynamometer rig representative of the EURO 4 standard were studied. The exhaust was passed to the Manchester aerosol chamber, which consists of an 18 m3 teflon bag and by injecting a sample of exhaust fumes into filtered and chemically scrubbed air, a controllable dilution can be performed and the sample held in situ for analysis by a suite of instruments. The system also allows the injection of other chemicals (e.g. ozone, additional VOCs) and the initiation of photochemistry using a bank of halogen bulbs and a filtered Xe arc lamp to simulate solar light.\nBecause a large volume of dilute emissions can be held for a period of hours, this permits a wide range of instrumentation to be used and relatively slow processes studied. Furthermore, because the bag is collapsible, the entire particulate contents can be collected on a filter for offline analysis. Aerosol microphysical properties are studied using a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) and Centrifugal Particle Mass Analyser (CPMA); aerosol composition using a Soot Particle Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (SP-AMS), Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2), Sunset Laboratories OC EC analyser and offline gas- and high performance liquid chromatography (employing advanced mass spectrometry such as ion trap and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance); VOCs using comprehensive 2D gas chromatography; aerosol optical properties using a Cavity Attenuated Phase Shift Single Scattering Albedo monitor (CAPS-PMSSA), 3 wavelength Photoacoustic Soot Spectrometer (PASS-3) and Multi Angle Absorption Photometer (MAAP); particle hygroscopcity using a Hygroscopicity Tandem Differential Mobility Analyser (HTDMA) and monodisperse Cloud Condensation Nuclei counter (CCN); and measurements of ozone, NOx and CO2.

Here, we report a newly discovered Cryogenian tillite (in Aksu section), and a diamictite and cap-carbonate couplet (DCC) (in Wushi section) from the northwestern margin of Tarim Craton, NW China. The Aksu tillite is represented by reddish conglomerates, comprising angular to subrounded, poorly sorted clasts with diameters of 5-30 cm. Notably, the glaciogenic features, such as striations on clasts can be observed. The DCC member in Wushi section, sits atop an angular unconformity, and represents the end-Cryogenian strata according to the regional sequence stratigraphy (at the base of the Sugetbrak Fm, redbeds with interbedded 615-Ma mafic magmatism). The upper cap-carbonate of the DCC member consists of a < 2m-thick pink dolomite, which directly and conformably overlies the lower red diamictite. Given the striking similarity in both sedimentological characteristics and stratigraphic positions, the Aksu tillites and the Wushi DCC member may represent the same glaciation, most likely the Marinoan glaciation. To further test the correlation, high-resolution C-O isotopes and representative samples for geochemistry (Strontium isotope and trace element ratios) from the cap-dolomite are measured. As for the Sr isotope analyses, an incremental leaching technique was employed to extract the information about the chemical compositions of post-glacial ocean water.\nThe δ13CPDB results consistently show moderate negative values of ca. -2.5‰. The minimum 87Sr/86Sr ratio from the leachates of each sample defines the contemporaneous seawater value, with the Mg/Ca ratio close to 1 (0.8). The 87Sr/86Sr ratios of all representative samples vary from 0.70680 to 0.70855. All the chemostratigraphic and cap-dolomite characteristics may suggest that our newly discovered Aksu diamictite and the Wushi DCC member represent the ending of the Cryogenian Marinoan glaciation.",

            "abstract": "With a warming climate, the world has experienced frequent droughts during the past few decades. A remotely sensed Drought Severity Index (DSI), which integrates both vegetation growth condition and evapotranspiration, has been recently proposed for drought monitoring at the global scale. However, there has been little research on its utility for regional application, especially on agricultural drought. As an important winter wheat producing region, the North China has suffered from frequent droughts in recent years. In this study, the capability of the DSI for drought monitoring and impact analysis in five wheat producing provinces of North China was investigated. First, the DSI was compared with precipitation and soil moisture to show its ability for characterizing moisture status. Then specifically for agricultural drought, the DSI was evaluated against agricultural drought severity and the impacts of drought on crop yield during the growing season were also explored using the 8-day DSI data. The main conclusions are: (1) The DSI shows generally good ability for characterizing moisture conditions at the province level with varying ability during winter wheat main growing season (March-June), and the best relationship was found in April. (2) Despite varying capability, the DSI is quite effective in characterizing agricultural drought severity at the province level. (3) Drought shows generally increasing agricultural impacts during winter wheat main growing season (March-June), with little impacts in March (green-up stage), emerging impacts in April (jointing and booting stages) and significant drought impacts in May (heading and filling stages). (4) Based on the spatial pattern of agricultural drought impacts, densely winter wheat planted areas such as South Hebei, Central/West Shandong and North/East Henan are identified as drought vulnerable regions and comprehensive monitoring in these hotspots is highly recommended.",

            "abstract": "Hydrology plays a pivotal role for the sustainability of the permafrost carbon reservoir in the Northern high latitudes under climate change. Changes in moisture conditions may significantly carbon pools and fluxes, and in addition trigger secondary shifts in biogeochemical and biogeophysical ecosystem properties, with feedbacks to the carbon cycle. The net impact of hydrologic disturbance, e.g. as a result of changes in drainage conditions, on the links between carbon processes and climate is therefore highly uncertain.\nThis study presents findings from an interdisciplinary experiment established on the floodplain of the Kolyma River near Chersky, Northeast Siberia. Parts of our study site have been artificially drained by ditches since 2004, simulating the formation of a channel system triggered by the thawing of ice wedges in ice-rich permafrost. Observations from this area are directly compared to data from a nearby undisturbed reference site. CO2 and CH4 flux measurements are available from 2 eddy-covariance towers operated year-round, and a distributed array of soil chambers. Additional observations target e.g. microbial and vegetation community structures, radiocarbon signals, nutrient availability and seasonal dynamics in phenology.\nDrainage has lowered average soil water levels by about 20cm, resulting in systematic shifts in e.g. soil temperature regime and snow cover. These dryer and warmer conditions have shifted the vegetation structure away from the formerly dominating cotton grasses towards tussock-forming sedges and shrubs. Microbial communities were found to have adapted to the new environment, e.g. concerning the dominating orders of methanogenetic archaea. Radiocarbon signals indicate that the drainage has unlocked older carbon pools from deeper layers. The combined effects of these changes reduce the CO2 uptake and significantly lower the CH4 emissions in the drained area, resulting in a higher net carbon sink compared to the reference. Seasonal dynamics of these shifts were found to be complex, particularly concerning the role of the shoulder seasons. Based on the altered functional relationships between environmental drivers and carbon fluxes, we expect that drainage will systematically affect the trajectories of carbon pools and fluxes under future climate change.",

            "abstract": "The elevation history of the Andes is highly debated. Rapid, substantial pulses of diachronous surface uplift in the middle to late Miocene have been claimed in the northern and southern Bolivian Altiplano. The interpretation is based on clumped isotope (Δ47) and oxygen isotope (δ18O) data and usually either (a) disregards climate change, or (b) applies arbitrary “climate corrections” that contrasts paleoclimate observations and climate model results. Here, we present new paleoelevation estimates from previously published Δ47-temperatures and δ18O data and demonstrate how paleoclimate modeling results from GCMs can be applied to Δ47-temperature estimates and how it affects paleoelevation assessments in the Andes.\nIn the southern Bolivian Andes, we find: (1) Δ47-derived temperatures reflect peak summer air temperatures (PSAT). Modern PSAT – elevation relationships imply Andean paleoelevation estimates of <2000m at 16 Ma, ~3000m at 13 Ma, and ~4000m at 8Ma. (2) Regional GCMs indicate a non-adiabatic PSAT change of 2.1°C/1000m. Taking regional cooling into account, estimated paleoelevations reach ~2300m at 16 Ma and ~3300m at 13Ma. (3) Assuming the middle Miocene Climatic Optimum caused a global mean temperature increase of 3°C, the newly estimated maximum paleoelevation for 16Ma would be ~2850m. In the northern Bolivian Andes, no modern Δ47-temperature estimates exist to ensure a correct correlation between modern elevation and clumped isotope temperatures. In addition, δ18O data exist only for elevations <1700m and >4000m. To establish the relationship between δ18O and elevation we use observations together with simulated δ18O at 4000m, 3000m, and 2000m from our GCM. Based on mean carbonate δ18O compositions, late Miocene paleoelevations are estimated to be ~3100m at 11Ma and ~4100m at 7Ma.\nWe anticipate to highlight the importance of a thoughtful interpretation of climate and climate change when inferring paleoelevations from isotopes. Our results demonstrate that middle to late Miocene carbonate clumped isotopes and δ18O data from the northern and southern Bolivian Altiplano may be interpreted to show synchronous uniform surface uplift.",

            "abstract": "The deep Indian Ocean’s role in the global overturning circulation is to upwell abyssal waters to deep and thermocline waters. This requires diapycnal diffusion of buoyancy downwards. The required diapycnal diffusivity (\"kappa\") is on the order of the Munk value 10ˆ-4 mˆ2/sec, but the spatial variability of kappa is enormous, ranging from greater than 10^-3 to less than 10^-6 mˆ2/sec. Moreover, large diapycnal mixing does not necessarily result from large diffusivity. We use the finescale parameterization for diapycnal diffusivity with WOCE CTD/LADCP profiles to map dissipation, diffusivity, and diapycnal mixing of heat, salt and buoyancy relative to topography, isoneutral surfaces that span the water column, and monsoon phase (northern Indian). Largest diapycnal mixing is found in the most energetic regions: downstream of Kerguelen Plateau, in the Agulhas, in the complex of western boundary currents along Madagascar, Somalia and the Arabian Sea, and along the eastern boundary (throughflow, Australian coast and Andaman Sea). Broad mid-basin diapycnal mixing occurs in the Madagascar and Mascarene Basins. Regions of high deep diffusivity but low diapycnal mixing include the Central Indian and West Australia Basins where the deep waters have low stratification. Regions of lowest mixing and lowest diffusivity, top to bottom, are the Bay of Bengal and central Arabian Sea. Upper ocean diffusivities are much lower than in the deep ocean, and match published estimates from Argo profiles (Whalen et al., GRL 2012). Diapycnal diffusivities and mixing from the high resolution POP general circulation model, which includes some but not all physical processes responsible for diapycnal mixing, are compared with these observations, providing insight into the multiple mechanisms controlling diapycnal mixing.",

This new information reveals that some areas of the globe are more sensitive to land cover change than others, with implications for global land use planning. The new information also reveals that there are fundamental land cover characteristics that affect ET variability with land cover type at the global scale, with implications for uncertainty analysis.",

            "abstract": "Temporal and spatial changes in monogenetic volcano morphology and internal architecture can determine eruption style and location. However, the relationships between the external and internal characteristics of volcanoes, and sub-volcanic intrusions, are often difficult to observe at outcrop or interpret uniquely from geophysical and geodetic data. This compromises our understanding of the birth, life and death of monogenetic basalt volcanoes. To address this, we use high-quality 2D seismic reflection data from the Ceduna Sub-basin, offshore southern Australia, to quantitatively analyse 46, pristinely-preserved, Eocene-age volcanoes and a genetically-related network of sub-volcanic sills and laccoliths. Detailed seismic mapping has allowed the 3D geometry of each volcano to be reconstructed and distinct seismic facies within them to be recognised. The volcanoes have average flank dips of <10.3°, basal diameters of 1.94–18.89 km, central summits that are 0.02–1 km above the contemporaneous palaeosurface, and volumes that range from 0.06–57.21 km3. Parallel, outward-dipping seismic reflections within the shield volcanoes are interpreted to represent interbedded volcanic and clastic material, suggesting that a series of temporally separate eruptions emanated from a central vent. The shield volcanoes typically overlie the lateral tips of sills and we suggest that the intermittent eruption phases correspond to the incremental emplacement of discrete magma pulses within the laterally extensive sill-complex. This work highlights that deformation patterns preceding volcanic eruptions may: (i) be offset from the eruption site; and (ii) attributed to intrusions with complex morphologies.",

            "abstract": "Topography in river channels reflects the time integral of streamflow-driven sediment flux mass balance. In dryland basins, infrequent and spatially heterogeneous rainfall generates a nonuniform sediment supply to ephemeral channels from hillslopes, and this sediment is subsequently sorted by spatially and temporally discontinuous channel flow. Paradoxically, the time integral of these interactions tends to produce simple topography, manifest in straight longitudinal profiles and symmetrical cross sections, which are distinct from bed morphology in perennial channels, but the controlling processes are unclear. We present a set of numerical modeling experiments based on field measurements and scenarios of uniform/nonuniform streamflow to investigate ephemeral channel bed-material flux and net sediment accumulation behavior in response to variations in channel hydrology, width, and grain size distribution.\nCoupled with variations in valley and channel width and frequent, yet discontinuous hillslope supply of coarse sediment, bed material becomes weakly sorted into coarse and fine sections that then affect rates of channel Qs. We identify three sediment transport thresholds relevant to poorly armored, dryland channels: 1) a low critical value required to entrain any grain sizes from the bed; 2) a value of ~4.5τ*c needed to move all grain sizes within a cross section with equal mobility; and 3) a value of ~50τ*c required to entrain gravel at nearly equivalent rates at all sections along a reach. The latter represents the ‘geomorphically effective’ event, which resets channel topography. We show that spatially variable flow below ~50τ*c creates and subsequently destroys incipient topography along ephemeral reaches and that large flood events above this threshold apparently dampen fluctuations in longitudinal sediment flux and thus smooth incipient channel bar forms. Both processes contribute to the maintenance of topographic simplicity in ephemeral dryland channels.",

However, a comprehensive understanding of the magnitude and dynamics of CH4 turnover and flux in developing soil ecosystems such as glacier forefields is still lacking. Glacier forefields progressively formed as a result of glacier recession feature various landforms with different physicochemical properties, which may affect CH4 turnover and flux. In addition, CH4 turnover and flux depend on a variety of environmental factors including soil-water content and -temperature, which typically follow seasonal patterns. In this study we investigated the variability in atmospheric CH4 turnover and associated soil-atmosphere flux in a Swiss glacier forefield during the snow-free season and on different landforms including sandhill, terrace, and floodplain. Turnover and soil-atmosphere CH4 flux was quantified using the soil-profile method and static flux chambers. To achieve high temporal resolution, nine sampling campaigns were performed. Turnover and flux measurements indicated substantial CH4 uptake on the sandhill (up to -0.69 mg CH4 m-2 d-1), with highest uptake observed early in the season. There was a noticeable trend for decreasing CH4 uptake with ongoing season. Conversely, CH4 flux on terrace and floodplain (avg. < -0.1 mg CH4 m-2 d-1) was substantially smaller than on the sandhill, and some individual flux chambers on terrace and floodplain even indicated intermittent CH4 emission. Our findings indicate that CH4 turnover and soil-atmosphere flux in glacier forefields may vary substantially during the snow-free season, and that there are substantial differences in CH4 flux between different glacier-forefield landforms.",

            "abstract": "We report the development and deployment of a remotely-controlled underwater robotic vehicle capable of being teleoperated under ice under real-time human supervision. The Nereid Under-Ice (Nereid-UI or NUI) vehicle enables exploration and detailed examination of biological and physical environments including the ice-ocean interface in marginal ice zones, in the water column of ice-covered seas, at glacial ice-tongues, and ice-shelf margins, delivering realtime high definition video in addition to survey data from on board acoustic, optical, chemical, and biological sensors. The vehicle employs a novel lightweight fiber-optic tether that will enable it to be deployed from a ship to attain standoff distances of up to 20 km from an ice-edge boundary. We conducted NUI’s first under-ice deployments during the July 2014 F/V Polarstern PS86 expedition at 86° N 6 W° in the Arctic Ocean - near the Aurora hydrothermal vent site on the Gakkel Ridge approximately 200 km NE of Greenland. We conducted 4 dives to evaluate and develop NUI’s overall functioning and its individual engineered subsystems. On each dive, dead-reckoning (Ice-locked Doppler sonar and north-seeking gyrocompass) complemented by acoustic ranging provided navigation, supporting closed-loop control of heading, depth, and XY position relative to the ice. Science operations included multibeam transects of under-ice topography, precision vertical profiles for the bio-sensor suite and IR/radiance sensor suite, IR/radiance/multibeam transects at constant depth interlaced with vertical profiles and upward-looking digital still-camera surveys of the ice, including areas rich with algal material. The fiber-optic tether remained intact throughout most of all 4 dives.

            "abstract": "With a total area of more than 50000 km^2 Lake Urmia basin in northwest of Iran was once one of the biggest salt lakes in the world. The lake has been shrinking in the recent years, losing in turn dramatically its area. A lot of factors have been attributed to this shrinking including construction of dams on the rivers feeding the lake and overexploitation of groundwater for agricultural and industrial purposes. In this study we first utilized time-series analysis of Landsat images to precisely quantify surface changes in the region between 1984 and 2013. We then analyzed a number of SAR images from 2002 to 2014 including 30 ASAR images from Envisat, 10 PALSAR images from ALOS, and more than 35 TerraSAR-X (TSX) in both Stripmap and Spot modes to assess surface ground deformation. Ground deformation was evaluated for both agricultural regions around the lake and Lake Urmia Causeway (LUC), connecting two provinces of East and West Azerbaijan on both sides of the lake. The InSAR results of the LUC embankments is further investigated using Finite Element approach to better understand the relation between soil parameters, lake level changes and settlement of the LUC.\nThe classification results using optical imagery analysis show that human and anthropogenic activities have resulted in shrinking of Lake Urmia by more than 60% over the past 30 years. The agricultural areas around the lake are dominated by ground subsidence reaching to 10 cm/yr in places. The LUC embankments also show large deformation with peak settlement of more than 5 cm/yr over the last decade. FEM simulation shows that consolidation due to dissipation of excess pore pressure in embankments can satisfactorily explain its surface deformation.",

            "abstract": "The overflow of dense water from the Nordic Seas to the North Atlantic across the Greenland-Scotland Ridge forms a major component of the deep branch of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and influences the climate system in Northwest Europe. Research has focused on deep convection of the Iceland Scotland Overflow Water (ISOW) and its links to climate variability in the North Atlantic. Our understanding of the history of the Denmark Strait Overflow Water (DSOW) is significantly less constrained and yet it accounts for half of the total overflow production today. We focus on the Eirik Drift south of Greenland in the vicinity of the DSOW. Down-core 230Thxs derived sediment focusing factors (Ψ) and measurements of the mean size of sortable silt reveal winnowed sediments during the Last Glacial Maximum and Heinrich 1 suggesting an influx of vigorous southern sourced waters and restricted DSOW production. Reduced overflow may be due to glacial isostatic processes which shoaled the Denmark Strait sill combined with a southward shift of deep convection sites in response to enhanced ice cover in the Nordic Seas. Intensification of the DSOW is evident between 9 and 13ka BP indicating initial deepening of the Denmark Strait sill and northward migration of the locus of deep water production. Ψ values for the Holocene suggest an active DSOW with a shift in the flow regime at 6.8 ka BP indicated by a reduction and subsequent stabilization of mean size sortable silt during the mid-late Holocene. This is corroborated by other studies showing a reorganization of the deep water after 7ka. An establishment of the Labrador Sea Water at intermediate depths altered the density structure of the deep western boundary current and weakened the ISOW. Changes in deep water circulation occur as North Atlantic climate entered Neoglacial cooling determined by Mg/Ca derived sea surface temperatures and abundances of the polar planktic foraminifera species N. pachyderma. They indicate a southward shift of the polar front in response to declining solar insolation during the late Holocene. Combined, our results suggest intimate links between the deep and surface ocean of the Labrador Sea.",

Simulations are performed at 0.1 degree (~5 km) ocean resolution and ice sheet resolution as fine as 500 m using adaptive mesh refinement. A comparison of fully-coupled and comparable standalone ice-sheet model results demonstrates the importance of two-way coupling between the ice sheet and the ocean.\nThe POPSICLES model couples the POP2x ocean model, a modified version of the Parallel Ocean Program (Smith and Gent, 2002), and the BISICLES ice-sheet model (Cornford et al., 2012). BISICLES makes use of adaptive mesh refinement to fully resolve dynamically-important regions like grounding lines and employs a momentum balance similar to the vertically-integrated formulation of Schoof and Hindmarsh (2009). Results of BISICLES simulations have compared favorably to comparable simulations with a Stokes momentum balance in both idealized tests like MISMIP3D (Pattyn et al., 2013) and realistic configurations (Favier et al. 2014). POP2x includes sub-ice-shelf circulation using partial top cells (Losch, 2008) and boundary layer physics following Holland and Jenkins (1999), Jenkins (2001), and Jenkins et al. (2010). Standalone POP2x output compares well with standard ice-ocean test cases (e.g., ISOMIP; Losch, 2008) and other continental-scale simulations and melt-rate observations (Kimura et al., 2013; Rignot et al., 2013).\nA companion presentation, \"Present-day circum-Antarctic simulations using the POPSICLES coupled land ice-ocean model\" in session C027 describes the ocean-model perspective of this work, while we focus on the response of the ice sheet and on details of the model.\nThe figure shows the BISICLES-computed vertically-integrated ice velocity field about 1 month into a 20-year coupled Antarctic run.

Various international organizations (ISC, EMSC, etc.) have produced “standard” exchange procedures to merge parametric data from different observatories. Nevertheless, this does not exist for events back to the year 60th despite they are of first importance for seismic hazard assessment.\nSeveral initiatives are regularly done to produce upgraded catalogs covering such period but they are most of the time “only merging” available parametric data and using, for magnitude homogenization, regressions between various datasets.\nThe SI-Hex project provides a catalogue of seismicity for metropolitan France related to the years 1962-2009 by taking into account the contributions of the various seismological networks. In contrast with all the previous French catalogs of seismicity, this collaborative project makes use of the original data coming from all regional and national seismic networks operating in metropolitan France, together with parametric data coming from the surrounding European networks.\nHypocenter locations are based on preferential solutions extracted from a multi-origin database. For each event from 1962 to 2009, one origin is computed using a single 1D velocity model covering metropolitan France and by merging arrival times coming from French and European stations. In order to improve the accuracy in hypocenter location, solutions calculated by regional observatory with regional velocity models, are taken as preferential solution when available.\nWe provide for the first time a Moment magnitude Mw. It was computed from coda-wave for most of the Mw>3.4 events, and from converted local magnitudes ML for the smaller events.\nSpecial attention was paid to the discrimination between natural and artificial seismic events.

This large observational evidence motivates the development of process-based models for improving global and regional inventories of contemporary CH4 and CO2 fluxes from lacustrine systems and future predictions of these fluxes in coupled Earth System models. For the thermo-hydrodynamic part of such models 1D (in vertical) lake parameterizations widely used in numerical weather prediction and climate modelling (Stepanenko et al., 2013)⁠ seem to be the best candidates. However, a bulk of observations demonstrates a large horizontal heterogeneity of bubble and diffusive methane fluxes in lakes, that may pose a principal difficulty to be simulated in a framework of 1D lake models. Are we able to retain the simplicity of 1D models and realistically capture the difference of carbon fluxes between deep and shallow parts and the total lake flux? Opportunities to solve this problem are discussed in this contribution based on the experience with 1D LAKE model (Stepanenko, Machul’skaya, Glagolev, & Lykossov, 2011)⁠ and 3D Large Eddy Simulation of lake and the atmospheric boundary layer above.\nBastviken, D., Tranvik, L.

            "abstract": "Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a technology that has the capacity to mitigate anthropogenic carbon dioxide release. However, the environmental impact of a leak of carbon dioxide gas from a sub-seabed CCS facility is, as yet, only partially understood. A field scale experiment was set up to simulate such a leak and investigate the environmental, geophysical and biogeochemical responses to a loss of containment in a CCS facility. Many findings were presented at the AGU Fall Meeting 2013 by Blackford et al, Lichtschlag et al, Cevatoglu et al and Taylor et al, among others. These new data add further to our understanding of the environmental impact of a sub-sea bed leak of carbon dioxide.\nDuring the simulated loss of containment from a CCS facility, carbon dioxide migrated through the sea floor sediments, reducing sediment pH and increasing the dissolved inorganic carbon content of the pore water. Both of these factors can change the solubility of trace metals in the sediment pore water, increasing their mobility and potentially affecting the flux between the sediment and the overlying sea water. Over-abundance of certain trace metals in the natural environment, such as Cu, As or Pb could have severe long-term implications for the fauna exposed to such an environment, due to their toxicity. During the release experiment, Diffusive Gradient in Thin-film (DGT) probes were deployed into the sediment. These gel and resin probes were placed across the sediment – water interface for 24 hours. They were then analysed using mass spectrometry with laser ablation, producing a high resolution vertical profile of metal concentration in the sediment and into the overlying water. On every deployment occasion, probes were deployed at the carbon dioxide release epicentre and at a reference zone, some 450 m distant. Probes were deployed numerous times during the experiment, providing information on the baseline conditions, the impact of carbon dioxide release and the rate of recovery to more normal conditions. The results from these deployments will be displayed, showing the impact of carbon dioxide migration on the mobility of dissolved metals in sediment pore water during the simulation of a leak from a CCS facility in the natural environment",

            "abstract": "We investigate the possibility of a stably stratified layer through core surface flow modelling. Motivated by the results of Buffett (2014), we seek a constant background flow, with time-varying flow which is both zonally and equatorially symmetric. Part of the time-varying flow includes an zonal, azimuthal (poloidal) motion. This feature is novel, as the standard flow non-uniqueness assumptions (for example, tangential geostrophy and toroidal flow) exclude this flow component. Indeed, a steady flow in a stably stratified medium does not allow such a flow; however, a poloidal flow is expected through wave motion in the stably stratified layer. The resulting flow is well able to explain features of the magnetic secular variation (for example, geomagnetic jerk signatures that are not explained by purely torsional motion). That a particular flow model can explain the data is not of particular significance - many different flow assumptions can provide such a fit. However, when a simple harmonic wave is fit to each flow component, then good variance reduction is achieved for a 50 year period, and the different modes display strong coherence in phase - broadly, successive toroidal modes are 180 degrees out of phase, and the poloidal components generally lag the toroidal by about 6 years. These coherent properties provide evidence in favour of this interpretation. We use a simple physical model of wave motion to relate the toroidal and poloidal components of flow, and interpret the strong phase coherence in terms of the properties of the layer, including the layer thickness and strength of stratification.\n Buffett, B., 2014.

            "abstract": "In seismic oceanography, the processed images show where small temperature changes (as little as 0.03°C) occur, although they do not give absolute temperatures. To get a 2-D temperature map, the data must be inverted for sound speed, which is then converted to temperature using equations of state.\nFull waveform inversion requires a starting model that is iteratively updated until the residuals converge. Global search algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm do not require a starting model close to the true model, but are computationally exhausting. Local search inversion is less expensive, but requires a reasonably accurate starting model. Unfortunately, most marine seismic data has little associated hydrographic data and so it is difficult to create starting models close enough to the true model for convergence throughout the target area. In addition, the band-limited nature of seismic data makes it inherently challenging to extract the long wavelength sound speed trend directly from seismic data. Laplace domain inversion (LDI) developed by Changsoo Shin and colleagues requires only a rudimentary starting model to produce smooth background sound speed models without requiring prior information about the medium. It works by transforming input data to the Laplace domain, and then examining the zero frequency component of the damped wavefield to extract a smooth sound speed model – basically, removing higher frequency fluctuations to expose background trends. This ability to use frequencies below those effectively propagated by the seismic source is what enables LDI to produce the smooth background trend from the data.\nWe applied LDI to five synthetic data sets based on simplified models of oceanographic features. Using LDI, we were able to recover smoothed versions of our synthetic models, showing the viability of the method for creating sound speed profiles suitable for use as starting models for other methods of inversion that output more detailed models.",

            "abstract": "CO2 increase in the atmosphere stimulates plant growth, and hence promote carbon uptake by land ecosystems (so called “CO2 fertilization effect”). This process forms a negative feedback loop between atmospheric CO2 concentration and terrestrial carbon amount (CO2 – land carbon feedback). This feedback can have a major impact on climate projections with an uncertain magnitude. This research focuses on the CO2 – land carbon feedback, and analyze the mechanisms how the feedback magnitude is determined in earth system models (ESMs).\nBy examining the simulation results from ESMs, we confirmed that multiple ESMs driven by a common scenario show a large spread of the feedback strength among models. By analyzing the behavior of the carbon fluxes and pools of the models in detail, we found that the sensitivity of plant productivity to elevated CO2 is the dominant factor to determine the strength of the CO2–carbon feedback, although increasing CO2 stimulates other carbon cycle processes. This result suggest that intensive research for plant production response to increasing CO2 is very important for making precise projection for long-term climate change.\nSimulations with a single ESM driven by different CO2 pathways demonstrated that carbon accumulation increases in scenarios with slower CO2 increase rates. Using both numerical and analytical approaches, we showed that the difference among CO2 scenarios is a time-lag of terrestrial carbon pools in response to atmospheric CO2 increase—a higher rate of CO2 increase results in smaller carbon accumulations than that in an equilibrium state of a given CO2 concentration. These results demonstrate that we cannot ignore the dependence of the CO2 – land carbon feedback on the carbon storage state, and suggest that the concentration feedback can be larger for future scenarios where the CO2 growth rate is reduced.",

We reviewed existing active structure databases, and obtained new information for structures that have not been thoroughly analyzed before. For example, the Central Geological Survey of Taiwan has published a comprehensive database of active faults in Taiwan, including all of the historically ruptured faults. Many other active structures, such as blind faults or folds that can be identified from geomorphic or structural analysis, have also been mapped and reported in several previous investigations. We have combined information from these existing databases to build an updated and digitized three-dimensional active structure map for Taiwan. Furthermore, for detailed information of individual structure such as long-term slip rates and potential recurrence intervals, we have collected the data from existing publications, as well as calculated from results of our own field surveys and investigations. We hope this updated database would become a significant constraint for the calculations of seismic hazard assessments in Taiwan, and would provide important information for engineers and hazard mitigation agencies.",

            "abstract": "Long-term and secure geological storage of CO2 through technologies such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) within reservoirs is seen as a technological means to reduce anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The long-term viability of this technology is reliant on the structural and secondary trapping of supercritical CO2 within heterogeneous reservoirs. Secondary trapping, primarily through the dissolution of CO2 into ambient reservoir brine to produce a denser fluid, is capable of retaining CO2 in the subsurface and thus reducing the risks of storage. To model secondary trapping we need to understand how the flow of CO2 through heterogeneous reservoir rocks enhances dissolution of supercritical CO2 in reservoir brines.\nHere we experimentally investigate the dissolution of CO2 in reservoir brines in layered, heterogeneous geological formations. Using analogue experiments, designed to approximate an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) setting, the processes of mixing, dispersion and dissolution are examined. These are compared against test results from non-layered, homogeneous porous media experiments. We find that heterogeneities significantly enhance mixing, particularly between adjacent porous layers. During fluid propagation, pore-scale viscous fingers grow and retreat, thereby providing an increased surface area between the flow and the ambient reservoir fluid. This enhanced mixing is predicted to substantially increase the dissolution of CO2 in reservoir brines. Both permeability and viscosity differences are found to have a significant effect on the interface between the two fluids, and therefore the likely amount of dissolution of CO2.",

            "abstract": "The eWaterCycle project works towards running an operational hyper-resolution hydrological global model, assimilating incoming satellite data in real time, and making 14 day predictions of floods and droughts.\nA problem encountered in the eWatercycle project is that the computer memory needed to store a single ensemble member becomes so large that storing enough ensembles to run the EnKF is impossible, even when using mitigating strategies such as covariance inflation or localization.\nReduction of Used Memory Ensemble Kalman Filtering (RumEnKF) is introduced as a variant on the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). RumEnKF differs from EnKF in that it does not store the entire ensemble, but rather only saves the first two moments of the ensemble distribution. In this way, the number of ensemble members that can be calculated is less dependent on available memory, and mainly on available computing power (CPU). RumEnKF is developed to make optimal use of current generation super computer architecture, where the number of available floating point operations (flops) increases more rapidly than the available memory and where inter-node communication can quickly become a bottleneck. In this presentation, two simple models are used (auto-regressive and Lorenz) to show that RumEnKF performs similar to the EnKF. Furthermore, it is also shown that increasing the ensemble size has a similar impact on the estimation error from the two algorithms\nIn this preliminary results, RumEnKF reduces the used memory compared to the EnKF when the number of ensemble members is greater than half the number of state variables. Future research will focus on strategies to further reduce the memory burden of running non-linear data assimilation on very large models.",

            "abstract": "New oceanic lithosphere is formed at slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges by a combination of eruption and intrusion of magma and by tectonic exhumation and alteration of lower crustal and mantle rocks. We look at the relationship between these two processes and how their relative contributions vary at non-transform ridge-segment offsets (NTOs). Models of mantle upwelling predict magmatic input and heat flux to be relatively low at NTOs, yet many host high-temperature hydrothermal systems, which are difficult to explain without the presence of a crustal magmatic source. We analyzed newly acquired swath bathymetry, gravity and magnetic data from the MARINER experiment together with archived data from the Rainbow NTO (36º10’ N) on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This NTO is currently experiencing both mantle exhumation and magmatic input as evidenced by the active Rainbow high-temperature hydrothermal field. We calculate mantle Bouguer gravity anomalies and crustal magnetization to constrain the lithospheric structure and tectonic evolution of the NTO during the past ~2 Myr. The swath bathymetry data are used to map faults, extrusive volcanic terrain and tectonized blocks and show that the style of crustal accretion varies along the adjacent ridge segments. Spatial changes in the style of extensional faulting are indicative of variations in the mechanical properties and the state of stress of the lithosphere. We suggest that the availability of magma to drive hydrothermal activity at Rainbow and other similar settings is controlled not only by the thermal regime and the structure of the lithosphere but also by the effect of local stress conditions on magma migration. Models of magma migration and dyking show that changes in the direction of minimum compressive stress affect the propagation of magmatic intrusions. We argue that stress rotation can explain the formation of crustal magma chambers at NTOs despite a reduced magmatic flux. These constraints help determine the role of stress in favoring or inhibiting magma supply at NTOs and the mechanisms affecting the availability of magmatic heat to drive hydrothermal circulation.",

Using the retrospective forecasts of six-state-of-the-art coupled models and their multi-model ensemble (MME) for December–January–February during the period of 1972–2005 along with corresponding observed and reanalyzed data, we examine the climate regime shift that occurred in the winter of 1988/1989 and how the shift affected interannual variability and predictability of two types of ENSO for the two periods of 1972–1988 (hereafter PRE) and 1989–2005 (hereafter POST). The result first shows substantial interdecadal changes of observed sea surface temperature (SST) in mean state and variability over the western and central Pacific attributable to the significant warming trend in the POST period. In the POST period, the SST variability increased (decreased) significantly over the western (eastern) Pacific. The MME realistically reproduces the observed interdecadal changes with 1- and 4-month forecast lead time. It is found that the CP-type ENSO was more prominent and predictable during the POST than the PRE period while there was no apparent difference in the variability and predictability of the EP-type ENSO between two periods. Note that the second empirical orthogonal function mode of the Pacific SST during the POST period represents the CP-type ENSO but that during the PRE period captures the ENSO transition phase. The MME better predicts the former than the latter. We also investigate distinctive regional impacts associated with the two types of ENSO during the two periods.",

            "abstract": "Production of odd nitrogen species (NOx = NO + NO2) in the polar middle atmosphere by energetic electrons and protons, and its effect in chemically perturbing stratospheric ozone distributions, is well established. NOx is likely to be produced frequently and persistently in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere by energetic electrons. However the electron processes are less well understood than those involving solar protons. Uncertainties include which electron energy ranges have the greatest impact on NOx concentrations either by direct production or indirectly via transport. We have investigated the effect of energetic electron precipitation on nitric oxide (NO) and ozone abundances in the Antarctic middle atmosphere close to solar maximum. During 2013 low to moderate geomagnetic activity occurred, with minimum Dst index of - 132 nT, driven primarily by sub-storms associated with coronal mass ejections. Near-continuous ground-based observations were made by a semi-autonomous 230-250 GHz passive microwave radiometer at Halley station (75°37’S, 26°14’W, L = 4.6, geomagnetic latitude -62°), Antarctica. This location is directly under the region of radiation belt electron precipitation, equator-ward of the auroral zone, and deep within the polar vortex during the Austral winter. We observe enhanced mesospheric NO volume mixing ratio reaching 1.6 ppmv at 65-80 km on 2013 day 158 (7 June). Co-located 30 MHz riometer absorption increased when Kp index ≥ 4, indicating increased ionisation due to geomagnetic activity at 75-90 km directly above Halley. NOx production by energetic electron precipitation is discussed in the context of Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellites electron count rates for the second generation Space Environment Monitor - Medium Energy Proton and Electron Detector. In order to evaluate the in situ production of NOx versus transport, we have incorporated in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) a reduced version of the Sodankylä Ion-Neutral Chemistry Model. The reduction procedure using the normalised Jacobian method, and initial WACCM results, will be briefly presented.",

As(V) was adsorbed to a similar extent with As(III) at low pH under competitive conditions.

            "abstract": "Geophysical methods have gained much interest in hydrology over the past two decades because of their ability to provide estimates of the spatial distribution of subsurface properties at a scale that is often relevant to key hydrological processes. Because of an increased desire to quantify uncertainty in hydrological predictions, many hydrogeophysical inverse problems have recently been posed within a Bayesian framework, such that estimates of hydrological properties and their corresponding uncertainties can be obtained. With the Bayesian approach, it is often necessary to make significant approximations to the associated hydrological and geophysical forward models such that stochastic sampling from the posterior distribution, for example using Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) methods, is computationally feasible. These approximations lead to model structural errors, which, so far, have not been properly treated in hydrogeophysical inverse problems.\nHere, we study the inverse problem of estimating unsaturated hydraulic properties, namely the van Genuchten-Mualem (VGM) parameters, in a layered subsurface from time-lapse, zero-offset-profile (ZOP) ground penetrating radar (GPR) data, collected over the course of an infiltration experiment. In particular, we investigate the effects of assumptions made for computational tractability of the stochastic inversion on model prediction errors as a function of depth and time. These assumptions are that (i) infiltration is purely vertical and can be modeled by the 1D Richards equation, and (ii) the petrophysical relationship between water content and relative dielectric permittivity is known. Results indicate that model errors for this problem are far from Gaussian and independently identically distributed, which has been the common assumption in previous efforts in this domain. In order to develop a more appropriate likelihood formulation, we use (i) a stochastic description of the model error that is obtained through principal component analysis (PCA) on temporally and spatially distributed training data, and (ii) an additional expression to consider normally distributed data noise.",

            "abstract": "The study of fractured rocks is extremely important in a variety of research fields and applications such as hydrogeology, hydrocarbon extraction and long-term storage of toxic waste. As fractures are highly conductive structures in comparison to the surrounding rock, their presence can be either an advantage or a drawback. For hydrocarbon extraction, fractures allow for quick and easy access to the resource whereas for toxic waste storage their presence increases the risk of leakage and migration of pollutants. In both cases, the identification of fracture network characteristics is an essential step.\nRecently, we have developed an approach for modeling electric current flow in 2D fractured media. This approach is based on a discrete-dual-porosity model where fractures are represented explicitly, the matrix is coarsely discretized into blocks, and current flow exchange between the fractures and matrix is analytically evaluated at the fracture-scale and integrated at the block-scale [1]. Although this approach has shown much promise and has proven its efficiency for 2D simulations, its extension to 3D remains to be addressed. To this end, we assume that fractures can be represented as two-dimensional finite planes embedded in the surrounding matrix, and we express analytically the distribution of electric potential at the fracture scale. This fracture-scale expression takes into account the electric-current-flow exchange with the surrounding matrix and flow conservation is enforced at the fracture intersections. The fracture-matrix exchange is then integrated at the matrix-block scale where the electric current flow conservation at the block boundaries is formulated with a modified finite volume method.\nWith the objective of providing a low-computational-cost modeling approach adapted to 3D simulations in fractured media, our model is (i) validated and compared to existing modeling approaches and, (ii) used to evaluate the impact of the presence of fractures on equivalent properties and synthetic simulations of electrical surveys.\n[1] Roubinet, D., and J.

We make measurements of the phase at periods from 25 to 100 s using a two-station method that assumes a great-circle arrival path for Love waves, and uses the estimated arrival angle for Rayleigh waves to correct the two-station calculation. Arrival-angle estimates are made with a mini-array method that employs a grid search to select the back-azimuth to the source that best predicts the phase observed on a local subset of stations. The two-station phase data with inter-station path lengths between 350 and 750 km are inverted to produce phase-velocity models at discrete periods. The new data set expands the modeled area, covering the entire contiguous United States.\nThe mini-array method also produces an estimate of the local phase-velocity. We calculate this local phase-velocity for both Love and Rayleigh waves, and compare the measurements with the maps resulting from the inversion of the two-station measurements. The local phase velocities, two-station phase velocities, and two-station phase-velocity models are all examined for bias resulting from overtone interference. Based on previous work, we expect overtone interference to affect Love wave measurements but not Rayleigh wave measurements, and to affect the local measurements more than the two-station models.",

            "abstract": "  The Chingshui geothermal field is located in the valley of Chingshui stream, where is about 27 km SW of Ilan, northeastern Taiwan.  It is a tectonically complex area occurred by the Philippine Plate subducting beneath the Eurasian plate in the south with Okinawa Trough opening in the Ilan Plain. Owing to complicated geological structure, the heat source of Chingshui geothermal field is still controversial. For understanding hot fluid sources and tectonic evolution, this study focuses on field survey of veins and scaling in the Chingshui geothermal field, and the results inferred from the data of SEM, XRD, carbon and oxygen isotope, and Uranium-thorium dating.\nThe Chingshui hot fluid contains both high concentrations of SiO­2 and HCO3-, therefore, temperature and pressure both drop when the hot fluids inject into shallower fractures, and calcite and quartz both could be precipitated with competition or simultaneously.\n  In Chilukeng River, many euhedral quartz crystals occurred in large damage zone of Xioananao fault that indicated the temperature drop played the dominated role when the hot fluids injected into the shallow. It inferred that the quartz crystal precipitated under compression stress, evidenced by the Xioananao thrust fault with no surface rupture. Whiles, there are gouges in normal fault with abundant calcite or calcite with quartz veins cropped out in the confluence of Chingshui River and Chilukeng River. The results indicate that those veins occurred in more recent period by U-Th dating data, because of degassing CO2 occurred in open fractures by normal faulting or the stress changing from compression to extension.\n The standard oxygen isotopes range from 1.29 to 20.73 permil of SMOW and the clumped isotope of Δ47 outcrop is 0.385 in calcite veins, suggest that the highest temperature of thermal fulids with calcite precipitations is 222℃±9℃ by calibrated equation of Passey and Henkes 2012. Meanwhile, it also indicates that the oxygen isotope of initial water is 6.31 permil of SMOW which is totally different from the values of -5.36 and -6.5~-7.1 in the meteoric water of Chingshui area and the scaling of Well IC-13, respectively. This result infers that the compositions of hot fluids may be changed with different source in the Chingshui geothermal field.",

            "abstract": "Pulverized fault zone rocks have been observed in the damage structure of several large bimaterial faults. They appear to have been shattered in situ, are associated with significant grain size reduction, and may be produced in response to dynamic reduction of normal stress during earthquake ruptures. Here we present results of a detailed microstructural analysis of pulverized granitoids from samples of ~40 m deep borehole near the San Andreas Fault (Wechsler et al., 2011). The study makes extensive use of optical and electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) and associated techniques. The host rock is a coarse-grained biotite granite slightly metasomatised collected about 1 km from the San Andreas fault. The pulverized rocks have fine to very fine grain sizes, heterogeneously distributed in thin-sections, with some grains as small as <5 µm. Nevertheless the mineralogical composition is essentially the same as the host granodiorite. All minerals, regardless of their composition, are fractured, and in most cases do not show evidence of rotation/translation. Shattered grains are highly angular and still preserve the high-temperature microstructures of the undeformed granodiorite, such as subgrains in quartz and feldspars. While quartz crystals have more anhedral shapes with few recognizable faces, plagioclase and K-feldspar fragments are more euhedral, suggesting that the pulverization process in feldspars is initiated and facilitated along their mechanical anisotropies. In some samples feldspar are mildly sericitized. Biotite grains might show intense kink-band development, typical of low-temperature deformation, and might be partially transformed to chlorite. When present, calcite grains have a very high twin density, suggesting relatively high stress conditions for their development. Further results (still in acquisition process) at µm-to-nm scale will be presented at the conference.",

(2006)] flows along the northern part of the Kuroshio/Oyashio mixed water region in the western Pacific Ocean. Observations (Isoguchi et al. 2006, Wagawa et al. 2014) have shown that the jet transports saline water in the subtropical Pacific Ocean to the subpolar region. To investigate how the subtropical water is transported through the quasi-stationary jet, numerical particle were tracked using a high resolution ocean reanalysis dataset, the Japan Coastal Ocean Predictability Experiment (JCOPE2). Particle released from the region near the quasi-stationary jet (152-158°E, 42-45°N) are tracked for one year from 15th day of every month and every year (1993-2013) with daily velocity of the JCOPE2 reanalysis at 30 m depth. Backward particle tracking shows that the particles near the jet come from wide southward area, which suggests that eddies are important in the transport process of the saline subtropical water. The number of particles that go back to the region south of 36°N within one year varies greatly in time, from 0.002% to 20% of the total particles. Forward particle tracking shows that the part of particles flows northeastward, which indicates the western subpolar gyre, while part of the particles are trapped in another jet-like current [referred to as J2 in Isoguchi et al. (2006)].",

            "abstract": "The melting temperatures of lower mantle minerals under high-pressure conditions are of importance for understanding the evolution of the interiors of the Earth and other planets, and to constrain whether deep melts exist in the Earth now. The melting temperatures of the Mg-end-member perovskite and periclase phases are very high under deepest lower mantle conditions and so experimental data are difficult to obtain and somewhat uncertain. We have, therefore, investigated the melting behaviour of MgSiO3-perovskite and MgO-MgSiO3 at pressures of 25 and 120 GPa via molecular dynamics simulations. All the simulations are performed adopting a liquid-solid (2-phase) model of about 750-900 atoms and using a combination of ab-initio and empirical pair-potential approaches. As expected, we find that the time required for the MgSiO3 system to melt increases substantially near the melting temperature. This requires, therefore, very long simulations times (hundreds of picoseconds) to melt the system near its melting temperature. These times are too long for ab initio simulations, but we are able to use the empirical potentials to correct the ab initio results to the true melting temperature. We find that the melting temperature of MgSiO3 at 25GPa is in very good agreement with previous experimental data (~2800 K). At 120 GPa the melting T is about 5500 K, again in agreement with previous shock-wave results. We also calculate the melting temperature depression at an approximately eutectic composition (MgO-MgSiO3). We find that the melting temperature decreases by about 100 K at 25 GPa, and 500 K at 120 GPa.",

            "abstract": "Seismological observations show that the presence of a small fraction of partial melt at the base of the mantle. The knowledge of chemical composition of such partial melt is key to understand its buoyancy and stability in the lowermost mantle. Recent melting experiments performed in the deep lower mantle conditions demonstrated that 1) MgSiO3-rich perovskite (bridgemanite) is the first phase to crystallize from melts with a wide range of (Mg + Fe)/ Si ratios in the middle to deep lower mantle and 2) iron is preferentially partitioned into melt rather than solid [Nomura et al., 2011 Nature; Tateno et al., 2014 JGR], suggesting that melts evolves towards a FeO-rich / SiO2-poor composition upon crystallization.\nHere we carried out melting experiments under both shallow and deep lower mantle pressures using a laser-heated diamond-anvil cell (DAC), in order to determine melting phase equilibria in the MgO-FeO-SiO2 ternary system. Several different starting materials were used. After heating at high pressure, sample was recovered from a DAC, and then examined with dual beam scanning microprobe (FIB + FE-SEM) (Versa 3DTM, FEI) and field-emission-type electron probe microanalyzer (FE-EPMA) (JXA-8530F, JEOL). On the basis of X-ray maps and quantitative point-analyses, quenched partial melt with non-stoichiometric composition was found at the center of the sample (the hottest part) and surrounded by a liquidus phase. The partial melts were sometimes in direct contact with more than one solid phases such as bridgemanite + ferropericlase or bridgemanite + stishovite, which can tightly constrain the locations of cotectic lines. These results imply that eutectic melt is strongly enriched in FeO in the MgO-FeO-SiO2 ternary system in a wide range of lower mantle pressures.",

The objective of this study is to assess the skill of the current and downscaled products of APCC’s seasonal forecast of 6-month lead-time for predicting ASO precipitation over the fire-prone regions. First, seasonal forecast skill by six individual models (MSC_CANCM3, MSC_CANCM4, NASA, NCEP, PNU, POAMA) and simple composite model (SCM) ensemble was assessed by considering available each ensemble members. Second, three different statistical downscaling methods including simple bias-correction (SBC), moving window regression (MWReg), and climate index regression (CIReg) were applied and the forecast sill were compared. Both current and downscaled seasonal forecast showed higher predictability over Sumatra regions compared to the Kalimantan regions. Statistical downscaling of forecasts showed the skill improvement over the Kalimantan region where current APCC’s forecast shows low predictability. Study also shows that temporal correlation coefficient (TCC) between observed and forecasted ASO precipitation increases as lead-time decrease.",

            "abstract": "Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is used to measure the functional group composition of organic aerosols (Russell et al., 2011). However, certain functional groups are not directly detected by FTIR spectroscopy, either due to fundamental limitations of the technique (e.g. tertiary carbons), or specific limitations of commonly employed methods of sample collection and analysis (e.g. ester and ether groups, Takahama et al., 2013). In addition, FTIR does not probe the size of molecules comprising an organic aerosol mixture, which prevents the direct calculation of organic aerosol volatility from FTIR measurements. In this study, primary organic aerosol concentrations in mixtures corresponding to different ambient scenarios have been extracted from previous GC-MS studies (Rogge et al., 1993). Secondary organic aerosol concentrations for different scenarios are simulated with an explicit chemistry model (Master Chemical Mechanism, http://mcm.leeds.ac.uk/MCM ; Jerkin et al. 1997; Saunders et al., 2003; Jerkin et al., 2003) and partitioning model (SIMPOL.1, Pankow et al., 2008). For each of the different scenarios the concentrations of functional groups that are typically accessible by FTIR are calculated and analyzed in relation to the extra information not easily accessible by FTIR (e.g. volatility, tertiary carbons, ester and ether). The ability to predict the unknown quantities from FTIR measurements and thereby reduce the uncertainty in OM concentrations and OM/OC ratios measured by FTIR is examined and discussed.",

The system consists of a cascade of two models, where the surface and sub-surface runoffs are computed by the Hydrology revised Tiled ECMWF Scheme for Surface Exchange over Land (HTESSEL) while the runoff routing and other hydrodynamic components are modeled by the LISFLOOD model. Since its set up in July 2011, GloFAS has been producing probabilistic discharge forecasts on daily basis at 0.1o spatial resolution with global coverage. The system is undergoing some updates that focus on the improvement of the hydrodynamic model, which include incorporation of an updated river network and river width maps, inclusion of lake and reservoir modules and a better representation of transmission losses. Additionally, a new web interface and web service for communication and visualization of the discharge forecast has been developed. Finally, the use of ECMWF re-forecasts as reference climatology to derive flood warning thresholds in comparison to those of ERA-Interim has also been assessed. In this work we present: 1) an overview of recent advances of GloFAS, 2) the results of an evaluation study which used ECMWF re-forecasts to derive global flood warning thresholds and 3) the role of the GloFAS in the recently launched Global Flood Partnership (GFP).",

            "abstract": "Modeling studies have indicated that global warming, in many regions, will increase the exposure of major crops to rainfall and temperature stress, leading to lower crop yields. Climate variability alone has a potential to decrease yield to an extent comparable to or greater than yield reductions expected due to rising temperature. For India, where agriculture is important, both in terms of food security as well as a source of livelihoods to a majority of its population, climate variability and climate change are subjects of serious concern. There is however a need to distinguish the impact of current climate variability and climate change on Indian agriculture, especially in relation to their socioeconomic impact. This differentiation is difficult to determine due to the secular trend of increasing production and yield of the past several decades. The current research in this aspect is in an initial stage and requires a multi-disciplinary effort. In this study, we assess the potential differential impacts of environmental stress and shock across different socioeconomic strata of the rural population, using village level survey data. The survey data from eight selected villages, based on the Project on Agrarian Relations in India conducted by the Foundation for Agrarian Studies, indicated that income from crop production of the top 20 households (based on the extent of operational land holding, employment of hired labour and asset holdings) is a multiple of the mean income of the village. In sharp contrast, the income of the bottom 20 households is a fraction of the mean and sometimes negative, indicating a net loss from crop production. The considerable differentials in output and incomes suggest that small and marginal farmers are far more susceptible to climate variability and climate change than the other sections. Climate change is effectively an immediate threat to small and marginal farmers, which is driven essentially by socioeconomic conditions. The impact of climate variability on smallholder agriculture in the present can therefore provide important insights into the nature of its vulnerability to future climate change.",

            "abstract": "We performed an analysis of the first tracer experiment at the Landscape Evolution Observatory (LEO) of the Biosphere 2 facility in Oracle, Arizona. The experiment involved multiple periods (four) of water/tracer injection and produced a hydrological response characterized by water and solute (deuterium isotope tracer) outflow along the lower lateral boundary (seepage face) of LEO. The collected data consist of spatially integrated and point-scale responses for both flow and transport, measured at fine temporal resolution. The simulations were performed with the CATHY (CATchment HYdrology) model, a finite element based model for the solution of the three-dimensional Richards equation for variably saturated flow and advection-dispersion equation for solute transport. The analysis looked at the impact of the unsaturated zone, initial water storage, soil heterogeneity, and other factors on the water and solute dynamics over the hillslope, and it examined some numerical issues connected to mass conservation, velocity field accuracy, advection-dominated processes, and solute exchange across the soil/atmosphere boundary. The overall aim is to address, based on a very detailed laboratory and modeling study, the many challenges of simulating multivariate hydrological responses. To give one example, it is found that water balance partitioning between seepage face and total storage and the average concentration at the seepage face are well reproduced with a parameterization that is not overly complex, while for the point-scale (internal state) response it is necessary to make the model more complex by augmenting the degree of heterogeneity of the soil hydraulic parameters.",

            "abstract": "Observations of in-situ cloud properties are an essential aspect of cloud microphysics studies. UAVs readily provide a platform from which high resolution cloud measurements can be made, both in the vertical and horizontal directions. Currently, however, one limiting factor in the use of UAVs for cloud studies is the lack of availability of lightweight, low power sensors. This work describes a number of small, disposable sensors for cloud droplet detection and electrical charge measurements, which have been flown on both free balloon and UAV platforms. The cloud droplet detector utilises optical reflection, combining a low power, high brightness LED as the optical source with a semiconductor photodiode as the detector. During daylight conditions, the photodiode detector also provides a measurement of broadband solar radiation, allowing an estimate of extinction within the cloud to be derived. The current consumption of the sensor is <30mA, and it has worked reliably in both day and night time conditions. Multiple flights of these sensors onboard UAVs with wingspan <2m (including Funjet and Easystar aircraft), made from southern France through a variety of cloud types will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Ambient optical properties of aerosols strongly depend on the particles' hygroscopicity and the relative humidity (RH) of the surrounding air. The key parameter to describe the influence of RH on the particle light scattering is the scattering enhancement factor f(RH), which is defined as the particle light scattering coefficient at defined RH divided by its dry value. Knowledge of this hygroscopicity effect is of crucial importance for climate forcing calculations and is needed for the comparison or validation of remote sensing with in-situ measurements.\nWe will present results of an intensive field campaign carried out in summer 2013 at the SMEAR II station in Hyytiälä, Finland, which was part of the EU-FP7 project PEGASOS (Pan-European Gas-Aerosols-climate interaction Study). Ground-based and airborne measurements of aerosol optical, chemical and microphysical properties were conducted. The f(RH) measured at ground by a humidified nephelometer was found to be significantly lower (1.53 ± 0.24 at RH=85% and wavelength λ=450 nm) than observed at other European sites (Zieger et al., 2013). One reason is the high organic mass fraction of the boreal aerosol as measured by an aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM). A closure study using Mie theory showed the consistency of the ground based in-situ measurements.\nOur measurements allowed to determine the ambient particle light extinction coefficient. Together with intensive aircraft measurements (lasting one month) of the particle number size distribution and ambient humidity, different columnar values were determined and compared to direct measurements and inversions of the AERONET Sun photometer (e.g., the columnar aerosol volume size distribution). The aerosol optical depth strongly correlated (R2≈0.9 for λ=440 nm to R2≈0.6 for λ=1020 nm) with the in situ derived values, but was significantly lower compared to the direct measurements of the Sun photometer (slope ≈0.5). This was explained by the loss of coarse mode particles within the in-situ measurements and by elevated aerosol layers (>3 km) from long-range transport layers that were observed using an aerosol LIDAR at Kuopio, Finland, about 210 km east of Hyytiälä.\nZieger, P., Fierz-Schmidhauser, R., Weingartner, E. and Baltensperger, U.

            "abstract": "We propose a revised magma chamber model for fast-spreading mid-ocean ridges based upon a synthesis of new data from a complete section of lower crust from the East Pacific Rise, reconstructed from samples collected from the Hess Deep rift valley during cruise JC21. Our investigation includes detailed sampling across critical transitions in the upper part of the plutonic section, including the inferred axial melt lens (AML) within the dyke-gabbro transition.\nWe find that an overall petrological progression, from troctolite and primitive gabbro at the base up into evolved (oxide) gabbro and gabbronorite at the top of the lower crustal section, is mirrored by a progressive upward chemical fractionation as recorded in bulk rock and mineral compositions. Crystallographic preferred orientations measured using EBSD show that the downward increase in deformation of mush required in crystal subsidence models is not observed. Together these observations are consistent only with a model in which crystallisation of upward migrating evolving melts occurs in situ in the lower crust.\nOver-enrichment in incompatible trace element concentrations and ratios above that possible by fractional crystallisation is ubiquitous. This implies redistribution of incompatible trace elements in the lower crust by low porosity, near-pervasive reactive porous flow of interstitial melt moving continuously upward through the mush pile. Mass balance calculations reveal a significant proportion of this trace element enriched melt is trapped at mid-crustal levels.\nMineral compositions in the upper third to half of the plutonic section are too evolved to represent the crystal residues of MORB. Erupted MORB therefore must be fed from melts sourced in the deeper part of the crystal mush pile, and which must ascend rapidly without significant modification in the upper plutonics or AML. From physical models of mush processes we posit that primitive melts are transported through transient, high porosity channels generated by gravitational instabilities that periodically overturn and drain crystallising melt bodies (sills) from deeper levels of the lower crustal mush.\nWe conclude that magma chambers are characterised by melt delivery to the deep crust, followed by in situ crystallisation of melts transported upwards via a dual-porosity system.",

Indeed tsunamis of height 2cm and more in open ocean were detected with GPS (Rolland et al. 2010). We present a new method to retrieve the tsunami height from GPS-derived Total Electron Content observations.\nWe present the case of the Mw 7.8 Haida Gwaii earthquake that occured the 28 october 2012 offshore the Queen Charlotte island near the canadian west coast. This event created a moderate tsunami of 4cm offshore the Hawaii archipelago. Equipped with more than 50 receivers it was possible to image the tsunami-induced ionospheric perturbation.\nFirst, our forward model leading to the TEC perturbation follows three steps : (1) 3D modeling of the neutral atmosphere perturbation by summation of tsunami-induced gravity waves normal modes. (2) Coupling of the neutral atmosphere perturbation with the ionosphere to retrieve the electron density perturbation. (3) Integration of the electron density perturbation along each satellite-station ray path. Then we compare this results to the data acquired by the Hawaiian GPS network. Finally, we examine the possibility to invert the TEC data in order to retrieve the tsunami height and waveform. For this we investigate the link between the height of tsunamis and the perturbed TEC in the ionosphere.",

            "abstract": "Increases in the amounts of available data as well as computational power opens the possibility to tackle ever larger and more complex problems. This comes with a slew of new problems, two of which are the need for a more efficient use of available resources and a sensible organization and storage of the data. Both need to be satisfied in order to properly scale a problem and both are frequent bottlenecks in large seismic inversions using ambient noise or more traditional techniques.\n\nWe present recent developments and ideas regarding a new data format, named ASDF (Adaptable Seismic Data Format), for all branches of seismology aiding with the aforementioned problems. The key idea is to store all information necessary to fully understand a set of data in a single file. This enables the construction of self-explaining and exchangeable data sets facilitating collaboration on large-scale problems. We incorporate the existing metadata standards FDSN StationXML and QuakeML together with waveform and auxiliary data into a common container based on the HDF5 standard. A further critical component of the format is the storage of provenance information as an extension of W3C PROV, meaning information about the history of the data, assisting with the general problem of reproducibility.\n\nApplications of the proposed new format are numerous. In the context of seismic tomography it enables the full description and storage of synthetic waveforms including information about the used model, the solver, the parameters, and other variables that influenced the final waveforms. Furthermore, intermediate products like adjoint sources, cross correlations, and receiver functions can be described and most importantly exchanged with others.\n\nUsability and tool support is crucial for any new format to gain acceptance and we additionally present a fully functional implementation of this format based on Python and ObsPy. It offers a convenient way to discover and analyze data sets as well as making it trivial to execute processing functionality on modern high performance machines utilizing parallel I/O even for users not familiar with the details.

Our records reveal that episodes of ice rafting typically occurred after abrupt cooling at the site. Because the site is sensitive to the earliest phases of ice rafting as recorded by other sites across the wider Atlantic, this suggests that icebergs were not the trigger for North Atlantic cold events. Moreover we find a different relationship between cooling and the arrival of rafted ice at a site ~750km to the SE of ours. We suggest that asynchronous cooling between these locations can be explained by the more gradual southward migration of the North Atlantic polar front. We describe a mechanism that can explain the occurrence of abrupt stadial events over Greenland as a non-linear response as regional cooling continues beyond the threshold necessary for sustaining ocean circulation in its ‘warm’ mode with active convection north of Iceland. Thus while the freshwater derived from melting icebergs may provide a positive feedback for enhancing and prolonging stadial conditions, it is probably not the trigger for northern stadial events.",

The newly collected data, including both physical and chemical components, provide a unique way to test and validate the parameterisation used to date.\nThe observed salinity of surface and blowing snow is very low; on average more than an order in magnitude smaller than column mean value. Here we apply a low salinity of 0.27 PSU (representing an average of the top 10cm of snow plus blowing snow samples) in the p-TOMCAT model to test its effect on sea salt concentrations reaching the Antarctic. The comparison with previous model output (using column mean salinity) shows that SSA concentration in central Antarctica is insensitive to change in snow salinity, due to the compensating effect of increasing fine SSA partitioning upon reducing the salinity. We also investigate the impact of changing the number of SSA particles formed from each snow particle on SSA concentration and size distribution. Applying a ratio of 10 SSA particles per blowing snow particle, rather than one as assumed to date, greatly increases the amount of sub-micrometer SSA reaching central Antarctica. Without applying blowing snow related SSA production in the p-TOMCAT model, the observed elevated SSA in the Weddell Sea could not be reproduced.",

            "abstract": "An adequate description of soil hydraulic properties is essential for a good performance of hydrological forecasts and soil water fluxes. So far, several studies showed that data assimilation could reduce the parameter uncertainty by considering soil moisture observations. However, these observations and also the model forcings were recorded with a specific measurement error. It seems a logical step to base state updating and parameter estimation on observations made at multiple time steps, in order to reduce the influence of outliers at single time steps given measurement errors and unknown model forcings. Such outliers could result in erroneous state estimation as well as inadequate parameters. This has been one of the reasons to use a smoothing technique as implemented for Bayesian data assimilation methods such as the Ensemble Kalman Filter (i.e. Ensemble Kalman Smoother).\nIn this contribution we present a Particle Smoother (SIR-PS) with sequentially smoothing of particle weights for state and parameter resampling within a time window as opposed to the single time step data assimilation used in filtering techniques. This can be seen as an intermediate variant between a parameter estimation technique using global optimization with estimation of single parameter sets valid for the whole period, and sequential Monte Carlo techniques with estimation of parameter sets evolving from one time step to another. The aims are i) to improve the soil moisture forecast by estimating hydraulic parameters, ii) to reduce the impact of single erroneous model inputs/observations by a smoothing method, and iii) to evaluate the performance of the SIR-PS as opposed to the SIR-PF using different ensemble and smoothing window sizes. In order to validate the performance of the proposed method for real world conditions, experimental data obtained from a two year lysimeter study were used.",

            "abstract": "The volcanoes of the Central Andean Subduction Zone are characterized by mostly explosive eruptions. This makes them especially hazardous and their eruptions have a high potential to affect the aviation safety over extensive areas. Láscar Volcano, in specific, has had explosive eruptions at intervals of 3-5 years within the last decades. Similarly, the volcanoes Lastarria and Putane show signs of activity. To unravel the processes causing the unrest and gain insight into eruption precursors these volcanoes need to be studied in spatial and temporal detail.\nHere we present new results on the state of activity of the Central Andean Subduction Zone volcanoes and investigate modes of complex interaction of these volcanoes to their surrounding environment. We generate a very high resolution digital elevation map from terrestrial laser scanner data and combine it with TerraSAR-X satellite data in order to analyse small-scale surface deformation over time. The results allow us to identify localized zones of strain accumulation. Results are compared to the spatial pattern of fumarole sites and their chemical characteristics as recorded by infrared and in situ stations. By means of time lapse camera records, levels of fumarole activity were recorded and compared to the time records of the other data. Integration of all these data into statistical models reveals a complex coupling of volcanic activity to intrinsic and extrinsic processes, including tidal forcing and large tectonic earthquakes. Our results show that the Central Andean Subduction Zone is a prime laboratory location that allows the investigation of how volcanoes and their environment are interacting.",

            "abstract": "In the past decade, a set of methods of parameterizing large-scale dynamics in limited area models have been developed based on our physical understanding of the tropical atmosphere. One of the methods, the weak temperature gradient (WTG) is to derive the large-scale circulation from the assumption that its action counteracts the local buoyancy anomaly and thus, maintains the horizontal variations of potential temperature close to zero in thedeep tropics. Another method, the damped-gravity wave (DGW) is to derive the large-scale circulation directly from the momentum equation. Other methods of parameterizing large-scale dynamics have been developed but this study considers only the WTG and DGW methods.\nThese methods of parameterizing large-scale dynamics offer a computationally cheap way to study a range of problems in which two-way interactions between tropical convection and large-scale dynamics are essential. They have been applied in both Cloud-Resolving Models (CRMs) and Single Column Models (SCMs). From such studies, much insight has been learned on what controls large-scale variation of tropical deep convection. However, both agreement and discrepancies between different studies are seen in the published results.\nThe GASS-WTG international intercomparison project was initiated in early 2014 to compare the WTG and DGW methods with a consistent implementation in a number of CRMs and SCMs, and to compare the behaviour of CRMs and SCMs under consistent parameterizations of the large-scale dynamics. Here, we discuss some of the main differences that have emerged between the models and methods. For instance, the WTG simulations produce a wider range of behaviour either comparing models against each other or against their own radiative convective equilibrium state. In addition, they are more sensitive to the choice of the initial states than the DGW simulations. In contrast to the DGW simulations, two distinct equilibria corresponding to either a persistent, precipitating state or a non-precipitating state are shown to exist in most models that applied the WTG methods. Furthermore, some models show a strong SST dependence in their behaviour, and finally some models produced\nincreased precipitation from the dry initial states.",

            "abstract": "About a half of soil carbon is stored in subsurface soil horizons, their dynamics have the potential to significantly affect carbon balancing in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the main factors regulating subsurface soil carbon mineralization are poorly understood. As affected by mountain humid monsoon, the subtropical mountains in central China has an annual precipitation of about 2000 mm, which causes strong leaching of ions and nutrition. The objectives of this study were to monitor subsurface soil carbon mineralization and to determine if it is affected by nutrient limitation. We collected soil samples (up to 1 m deep) at three locations in a small watershed with three soil layers (0-10 cm, 10-30 cm, below 30 cm). For the three layers, soil organic carbon (SOC) ranged from 35.8 to 94.4 mg g-1, total nitrogen ranged from 3.51 to 8.03 mg g-1, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) ranged from 170.6 to 718.4 μg g-1 soil. We measured carbon mineralization with the addition of N (100 μg N/g soil), P (50 μg P/g soil), and liable carbon (glucose labeled by 5 atom% 13C, at five levels: control, 10% MBC, 50% MBC, 100% MBC, 200% MBC). The addition of N and P had negligible effects on CO2 production in surface soil layers; in the deepest soil layer, the addition of N and P decreased CO2 production from 4.32 to 3.20 μg C g-1 soil carbon h-1. Glucose addition stimulated both surface and subsurface microbial mineralization of SOC, causing priming effects. With the increase of glucose addition rate from 10% to 200% MBC, the primed mineralization rate increased from 0.19 to 3.20 μg C g-1 soil carbon h-1 (fifth day of glucose addition). The magnitude of priming effect increased from 28% to 120% as soil layers go deep compare to the basal CO2 production (fifth day of 200% MBC glucose addition, basal CO2 production rate for the surface and the deepest soil was 11.17 and 2.88 μg C g-1 soil carbon h-1). These results suggested that the mineralization of subsurface carbon is more sensitive to nutrient addition, and carbon mineralization in this layer is likely limited by carbon availability. Thus, any changes in environment conditions (global warming, nitrogen deposition, precipitation pattern change etc.) that affect the distribution of fresh carbon in soil profiles could then stimulate the release of deep soil carbon.",

            "abstract": "Wave-particle interactions play an important role in influencing the Earth´s inner magnetosphere dynamics. We study the whistler wave generation with an implicit particle-in-cell code (iPIC3D) within unstable equatorial regions identified by the kinetic ring current model RAM-SCB. During storm time, RAM-SCB shows that hot electrons on the dayside demonstrate high temperature anisotropy, implying that it is unstable to whistler wave excitation. By using plasma parameters from RAM-SCB results, we carry out iPIC3D simulations assuming a bi-Maxwellian distribution for electrons. We found that with an electron temperature anisotropy of 4, electron density of 6 cm−3 , and parallel temperature T|| of 1keV on the dayside around L of 5.5, whistler waves are rapidly excited and propagate along the background magnetic field line. Comparisons with linear theory show good agreements on the wave mode and frequency at which the whistler waves are excited, as well as on the linear growth rate of the maximum wave mode. The electron velocity distribution is significantly changed after the wave generation, towards a smaller anisotropy due to the pitch-angle scattering transport process. Furthermore, test particles are tracked in the whistler wave environment developed during the linear growth phase (with an amplitude of 0.05 B0) to examine the pitch angle diffusion. The diffusion coefficient is calculated and found to be one to two orders of magnitude smaller than the quasi-linear theory, which implies that the quasi-linear theory may predict a much faster loss of the radiation belts. In addition, in contrast to the quasi-linear theory that shows monotonic dependence on the electron pitch angle, the coefficient calculated from iPIC simulations are rather insensitive to the pitch angle.",

            "abstract": "The water stored in the various compartments of the terrestrial ecosystem (in snow, canopy interception, soil and litter) controls the exchange of the water and energy between the land surface and the atmosphere. Therefore, measurements of the water stored within these pools are critical for the prediction of e.g. evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge.\nThe detection of cosmic-ray neutron intensity is a novel non-invasive method for the quantification of continuous intermediate-scale soil moisture. The footprint of the cosmic-ray neutron probe is a hemisphere of a few hectometers and subsurface depths of 10-70 cm depending on wetness. The cosmic-ray neutron method offers measurements at a scale between the point-scale measurements and large-scale satellite retrievals.\nThe cosmic-ray neutron intensity is inversely correlated to the hydrogen stored within the footprint. Overall soil moisture represents the largest pool of hydrogen and changes in the soil moisture clearly affect the cosmic-ray neutron signal. However, the neutron intensity is also sensitive to variations of hydrogen in snow, canopy interception and biomass offering the potential to determine water content in such pools from the signal.\nIn this study we tested the potential of determining canopy interception and biomass using cosmic-ray neutron intensity measurements within the framework of the Danish Hydrologic Observatory (HOBE) and the Terrestrial Environmental Observatories (TERENO). Continuous measurements at the ground and the canopy level, along with profile measurements were conducted at towers at forest field sites. Field experiments, including shielding the cosmic-ray neutron probes with cadmium foil (to remove lower-energy neutrons) and measuring reference intensity rates at complete water saturated conditions (on the sea close to the HOBE site), were further conducted to obtain an increased understanding of the physics controlling the cosmic-ray neutron transport and the equipment used.\nAdditionally, neutron transport modeling, using the extended version of the Monte Carlo N-Particle Transport Code, was conducted. The responses of the reference condition, different amounts of biomass, soil moisture and canopy interception on the cosmic-ray neutron intensity were simulated and compared to the measurements.",

            "abstract": "Quasi-decadal hydrographic sections of the GO-SHIP program cross the world’s oceans with the highest accuracy measurements, documenting temporal variability in physical and chemical properties. The central southern Pacific and Ross Sea have been surveyed regularly along GO-SHIP sections P16S (150W) and S4P (67S) since the first occupation in WOCE in 1992. Observed changes are consistent with anthropogenic forcing. The central Ross Sea gyre’s bottom 1000 m is nearly adiabatic (well mixed), and well-ventilated based on chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and sulfur hexafluoride observations (see Figure), and can be easily compared from one survey to the next. This Ross Sea bottom layer observed in March, 2014, on P16S continued to warm, with a monotonic increase over the 4 WOCE/GO-SHIP surveys thus far: 1992, 2005, 2011, and now 2014 (see Figure). Deep temperature has increased by 0.1°C since 1992, continuing the trend of enhanced global ocean deep warming in the Southern Ocean documented by Purkey/Johnson (2010) and IPCC AR5 WG1. The abyssal central Ross Sea waters also continued to freshen slightly. The upper ocean in the Ross Sea warmed, became more stratified, had higher nutrients and total carbon, and was less ventilated in terms of apparent oxygen utilization than in 2005. North of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current along 150W, the upper ocean’s Subantarctic Mode Water became saltier, also continuing the subtropical trend of the past several decades (Durack/Wijffels 2010), with an apparently stronger incursion of saline subtropical waters that render it more salt and temperature stratified, ruling out a local deep mixed layer formation mechanism, with an increasing tendency towards double diffusive processes. The Antarctic Intermediate Water salinity minimum continued to freshen. The arrival in 2014 of CFC’s at the ocean bottom between 32S and 40S indicates that the Antarctic Bottom Water there is about 40-50 years old. CFCs in the ocean’s surface layer decreased, in accord with decreasing atmospheric concentration, while CFCs in the deep subtropical pycnocline continued to increase as the upper ocean’s transient moved downwards into the ocean.",

The fine scale field wind of 100 m spatial resolution is required for the CALPUFF modeling in the complex terrain near the coastal area.\nThe objective of this paper is to provide information how to calculate the fine scale wind field using recent advances in the meteorological model. The diagnostic model of CALMET has been used to generate fine grid scale wind field by interpolating output of mesoscale prognostic weather models of MM5 (short for Fifth-Generation Penn State/NCAR Mesoscale Model) and WRF (Weather Research and Forecast). The MMIF(The Mesoscale Model Interface Program) interfacial program directly converting WRF meteorological output to formats appropriate for CALPUFF modeling without diagnostic interpolations is recently developed.\nThe modeling comparison between WRF/CALMET and WRF/MMIF was carried out to find out a best way in generating fine wind field in the complex geological conditions. For the WRF/CALMET modeling, WRF model output of 900m grid resolution was provided to CALMET model and CALMET then calculated the fine grid resolution of 100m by diagnostically interpolating the WRF output. For the WRF/MMIF modeling, the WRF model directly calculate the fine grid of 100m and the MMIF program was used to convert WRF data.\nIn order to validate model performance of two methods, simulated variables of meteorological fields were compared with observations at the landfill site near the coast in KOREA. It is found that WRF/MMIF is in better agreement with observations than CALWRF/CALMET in respect to the statics of RMSE and IOA. CALPUFF modeling with landfill emission data of H2S was performed and compared with monitoring data to identify effects on meteorological data on the final outcome of CALPUFF dispersion modeling.",

            "abstract": "Check-dam systems have been the most widespread and effective engineering structures for conserving water and soil in the Loess Plateau in the recent 30 years. Hydrologic response in Wangmaogou, a representative small catchment with 7 different kinds of land use types and 22 existing check dams (including newly-built, partial-destroyed, fully-deposited) in the Loess Plateau, is investigated via field data analysis and numerical simulation. Field data collected in this study include rainfall, discharge, and saturated soil hydraulic conductivity and soil water content and soil water characteristic curves at different depths, and surface water depth in front of check-dams during extreme rainfall events. A physics-based distributed model, the Integrated Hydrology Model (InHM) is employed to execute both seasonal rainfall-SWC (soil water content) simulation and event based rainfall-runoff simulation. Validation results show that InHM simulated SWC matches well with the measured SWC in the 18 TDR burial spots and it can successfully grasp extreme low discharge at the outlet of the catchment when most of the rainwater is blocked by the dam system. The study leads to the following results for the region: 1) the surface flow is dominated by the Horton overland flow occurring in most of the slopes covered by crusted grass; 2) the check dams built in the gullies can effectively prevent the valuable rainwater from running out of the catchment (about 90%) by terrain blocking and increasing infiltration of the sedimentary fields; 3) some nearly fully-deposited check-dams built on the end of the gully are under high risk of dam break during the extreme rainfall events because of the high water depth in front of the dam. The study confirms the applicability of InHM in the Loess Plateau, and the results expand our understanding about the hydrologic response in check-dam systems.",

            "abstract": "Seven gravity cores (2.5~8-m long) from southern Drake Passage were analyzed for magnetic susceptibility, grain size distribution, total organic carbon, and total inorganic carbon content to reconstruct paleoceanographic changes in late Quaternary. Glacial sediments from southern Drake Passage are distinguished from interglacial sediments by their higher magnetic susceptibility and lower total organic carbon, due to the increased influx of magnetic minerals from nearby source areas (South Shetland Islands and northern Antarctic Peninsula) during glacial periods and increased marine productivity during interglacial periods. Correlation among the cores based on magnetic susceptibility indicates that sedimentation rates are higher in northeastern cores than in southwestern cores. Northeastern cores record paleoceanographic changes since the last glacial period, whereas a southwestern core of the lowest sedimentation rate show records of last ~900 thousand years. Carbonate content is higher in interglacial sediments than in glacial sediments prior to mid-Pleistocene transition (MPT), reflecting higher productivity during interglacial periods. Since the MPT carbonate dissolution occurs widely, and carbonates are preserved only in some glacial sediment. Absence of carbonate in post-MPT interglacial sediments suggests an invasion of corrosive deep water, possibly from Weddell Sea, since the MPT. Influence of Weddell Deep Water decreased during glacial periods due to extensive ice sheets and weakened current from the Weddell Sea, and carbonates are preserved in some post-MPT glacial sediment.",

            "abstract": "The project „Sustainable Land Management“ (SuLaMa) aims at the participatory development and implementation of alternative land-use management practices to protect the ecosystem and its biodiversity and improve the livelihood of the local population in a sustainable manner. One critical aspect within this project is the availability of sustainable water resources. To approach reliable estimates about the availability and dynamics of the water resources, we started a study to understand in detail the hydrogeology of the South-West of Madagascar. As this area has an extend of about 40000 square kilometers, the study is based on a multi-scale approach. Rough large scale estimates are utilized to develop a general understanding of the hydrogeology in the South-West of Madagascar, which allows for large scale estimates of hydrogeology under changing boundary conditions like climate change. Detailed investigations at target villages of the SuLaMa project, combined with boundary conditions derived from the large scale hydrogeological model, allows for estimates of the local hydrogeology under changing boundary conditions like enhanced water abstraction.\nAlthough several governmental and nongovernmental institutions have been working on the water resources of the South-West of Madagascar in the past, only few sources on the hydrogeology of this area can be found in literature. To improve the data base we installed five automatic loggers in the area to measure groundwater levels as function of time and investigated in detail about one hundred wells in terms of geometry, groundwater level, electrical conductivity and pH.\nFirst preliminary results of the study show that the hydrogeology in the study area is dominated by four major hydrogeological units (fractured crystalline basement, karstic plateau, porous perched aquifers and a porous coastal area) and can be analyzed effectively by assuming a radial symmetric geometry. Ongoing efforts are the development of a model for a spatially variable groundwater recharge estimates and advanced hydrogeological models. The latter consisting of high resolution small scale and low resolution large scale estimates. Based on these models, we will develop numerical flow models to evaluate water resources as function of changing boundary conditions at multiple scales.",

            "abstract": "An extensive set of in situ water vapor (H2O) measurements obtained by the CARIBIC passenger aircraft at cruise altitude from 2005 to 2013 is presented. A description of the vertical distribution of H2O from the upper troposphere (UT) via the extra-tropical tropopause mixing layer (exTL) into the lowermost stratosphere (LMS) is given. H2O was found to undergo considerable seasonal variation, with maxima in summer and remaining in phase from the UT up to about 4 km above the tropopause. The transport and dehydration pathway of air starting at the Earth’s surface and ending at 10-12 km altitude is reconstructed based upon (i) potential temperature, (ii) relative humidity w.r.t. ice (RHi), and (iii) back trajectories as a function of altitude relative to the tropopause. RHi of an air mass is found to be primarily determined by its temperature change during recent vertical movement, i.e. cooling during ascent/expansion and warming during descent/compression. The data show with great clarity that H2O and RHi at 10-12 km altitude are controlled by three dominant transport/dehydration pathways: (i) the Hadley circulation, i.e. convective uplift in the tropics and pole-ward directed subsidence drying from the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) with observed RHi down to 2%, (ii) warm conveyor belts and mid-latitude convection transporting moist air into the UT with observed RHi usually above 60%, and (iii) the Brewer-Dobson shallow and deep branches with observed RHi down to 1%.",

Consequently, suitable and accurate methods for concentration as well as stable isotopic composition analysis of carbon and nitrogen in waters and aqueous solutions play a significant role.\nTraditionally dissolved carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis (SIA) is performed using either offline sample preparation followed by elemental analysis isotope ratio mass spectrometry (EA/IRMS) or modified wet chemical oxidation based device coupled to IRMS. Recently we presented a high temperature combustion system (HTC), which significantly improves upon these methods for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) SIA.\nThe analysis of δ15N of dissolved nitrogen still has large limitations. Its low concentration makes EA/IRMS laborious, time and sample consuming. Systems based on wet chemical oxidation-IRMS bare the risk of sensitivity loss as well as of fractionation due to incomplete mineralization. In addition, the high solubility of molecular nitrogen in water remains a technical challenge, as it requires additional separation steps to distinguish between physically dissolved nitrogen and bound nitrogen.\nFurther development of our HTC system lead to the implementation of the δ15N determination which now coupled, into a novel total organic carbon (TOC) analyzing system, especially designed for SIA of both, carbon and nitrogen. Integrated, innovative purge and trap technique (peak focusing) for nitrogen with aluminosilicate adsorber and peltier element based cooling system, in combination with high injection volume (up to 3 mL) as well as favorable carrier gas flow significantly improves sensitivity. Down to 1ppm and less total nitrogen can be measured with precision of ≤ 0.5‰. To lower the background caused by physically dissolved nitrogen new, membrane-vacuum based, degasser was designed for online separation of physically dissolved nitrogen.\nThis novel HTC system, “iso TOC cube”, provides an innovative tool with large potential in investigation of biogeochemical carbon and nitrogen cycles.",

            "abstract": "A coupled modeling approach is applied to simulate the long-term (1961-2012) surface mass balance and subsurface evolution of the Kongsvegen and Holtedahlfonna glacier systems in western Svalbard. Principle aims are: 1) to quantify and analyze the distributed surface mass balance evolution, 2) to estimate the contribution of melt water refreezing and internal accumulation to the mass balance, and 3) to detect changes in firn conditions over the simulation period. In order to achieve this, HIRLAM regional climate model output for 1961-2012 is projected onto the 100-m model grid and serves as input for a coupled model surface energy balance – firn model. Available stake measurements since 1987, together with weather station data and snow profiling observations, are used for parameter estimation, as well as validation of the model results. Extensive spin-up is performed to provide initialized subsurface conditions at the start of the experiments. Results indicate a slightly positive area-averaged surface mass balance of 0.08 m w.e. yr-1, which only fractionally compensates for mass loss by calving. Melt water refreezing (spatial mean 0.30 m w.e. yr-1) provides a strong buffer for mass loss, whereas substantial internal accumulation (up to 0.22 m w.e. yr-1) adds uncertainty to mass balance observations in the accumulation zone. An increasingly negative surface mass balance over the last two decades has led to a retreat of the firn line and a substantial reduction of the firn air content. Together with a negative trend in the albedo and elevated runoff this could mark the onset of accelerated near-future mass loss.",

            "abstract": "The growth, composition, and evolution of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) are governed by properties of individual compounds and ensemble mixtures that affect partitioning between the vapor and condensed phase. There has been considerable recent interest in the idea that SOA can form highly viscous particles where the diff usion of either water or semivolatile organics within the particle is suffi ciently hindered to aff ect evaporation and growth. Despite numerous indirect inferences of viscous behavior from SOA evaporation or “ bounce”  within aerosol instruments, there have been no bulk measurements of the viscosity of well-constrained model aerosol systems of atmospheric signifi cance. Here the viscous behavior of a well-defi ned model system of 9 dicarboxylic acids is investigated directly with complementary measurements and model predictions used to infer phase state. Results not only allow us to discuss the atmospheric implications for SOA formation through this representative mixture, but also the potential impact of current methodologies used for probing this aff ect in both the laboratory and from a modeling perspective. We show, quantitatively, that the physical state transformation from liquid-like to amorphous semisolid can substantially increase the importance of mass transfer limitations within particles by 7 orders of magnitude for 100 nm diameter particles.

To better understand the cause of the density depletions, we investigate the solar wind parameters and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) data related to the solar wind density depletion events during the period from 1996 to 2013 that are obtained with the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) and the WIND satellite. As a result, we found that the solar wind density has an anti-correlation with IMF strength during all events of solar wind density depletion, regardless of the presence of IP shocks. We thus argue that IMF strength is an important factor in understanding the nature of solar wind density depletion. Since IMF strength varies with solar cycle, we also investigate the characteristics of solar wind density depletion events in different phases of solar cycle as an attempt to find its connection to the sun.",

The record has excellent age control from C-14 and correlation of Np(s) to Greenland ice cores (NGRIP GICC05 scale) (Hibbert et al., 2010, JQS, Austin & Hibbert, 2012, QSR). The record displays a slowdown in deep circulation from 20 to 17.5ka, a faster H-1a and slower H-1b (16.4-14.7 ka), a faster B-A with evident slowing at Older Dryas and IACP, and slow YD. The Holocene shows slower flows around 8.4-7.5, 6.3-5.5 and 3.5 -2.7 ka as well as the Little Ice Age. The a/b differentiation of the Heinrich event is mirrored by changes in d18O at NGRIP with boundaries at 17.8 and 16.3 ka on GICC05 tentatively correlated with H-1b.\nBenthic Carbon isotope (d13C) variations and values are very similar to those found at 3150 m water depth off Portugal (Skinner & Shackleton, 2004, PaleO), where Shackleton et al (2000, PaleO) show that the water mass is strongly SSW influenced in both warm and cold periods. At the present day there is evidence of SSW (LDW of McCartney, 1992 Progr in O) in Rockall Trough from silicate values greater than those of NE Atlantic Deep water of northern overflow origin. We suggest that bottom water in the Trough during deglaciation contained a major component of southern origin. This is consistent with suggested upper bounds of SSW at ~2000 m elsewhere in the N. Atlantic. This water appears to have responded dynamically to northern hemisphere climatic forcing, although supplied from around Antarctica. In this, its behaviour is similar to the changes in circulation vigour recorded by Pa/Th at 4500 m on Bermuda Rise that must also have been dominated by SSW (McManus et al., 2004, Nature)\nThe κARM/κ grain size parameter reflecting fine magnetite grain size proxy which is sensitive to grain sizes well below the SS range indicates progressive fining of magnetic grain size across the Termination, in contrast to the highly variable sortable silt mean size changes. The magnetic grain-size parameter probably reflects deglacial variations in sediment source from Scotland and Ireland and is not related to flow vigour as some have contended.",

Even though the plate is surrounded by seismic zones of deep- and intermediate-depth earthquakes (originating from the Philippines, Banda Sea, Mariana and New Britain Island), available seismic dataset of source-receiver pair is limited due to the scarcity of land-based seismic stations. In particular, seismic stations are limited in the western and eastern sides of the Caroline Plate. In this study, we perform investigations on the seismic resolution using waveform inversion approach. Earthquake data sets in the last decade obtained from publicly available seismic stations were used to examine the presumed mantle transition zone (MTZ), whose depth ranges from 410 to 660 km in three dimensions. Our analysis shows that, although the current coverage may be marginally sufficient to assess the presence or absence of stagnant slab, the number of ray paths, especially towards the equator, is too limited to obtain high-resolution three-dimensional structure. Hence, it is important to install additional seismic stations (most likely, in the form of the broadband ocean bottom seismometers) around the Caroline Plate. A number of optimal sites are suggested based on our resolution tests. It is hoped that by placing additional ocean bottom seismometers several important issues regarding the nature of MTZ beneath Caroline Plate can be explored that could not be addressed by global tomography models alone such as its origin.",

A multi-source data processing middleware in the backend is linked to MODIS data from Land Processes Distributed Archive Center (LP DAAC) and Google Earth Engine as well as daily climate station data from NOAA National Climatic Data Center.\nOGC Web Processing Services are used to integrate datasets from linked data providers or external OGC-compliant interfaces to the EOM. Users can either use the web portal (webEOM) or the mobile application (mobileEOM) to execute these processing services and to retrieve the requested data for a given point or polygon in userfriendly file formats (CSV, GeoTiff). Beside providing just data access tools, users can also do further time series analyses like trend calculations, breakpoint detections or the derivation of phenological parameters from vegetation time series data. Furthermore data from climate stations can be aggregated over a given time interval. Calculated results can be visualized in the client and downloaded for offline usage.\nAutomated monitoring and alerting of the time series data integrated by the user is provided by an OGC Sensor Observation Service with a coupled OGC Web Notification Service. Users can decide which datasets and parameters are monitored with a given filter expression (e.g., precipitation value higher than x millimeter per day, occurrence of a MODIS Fire point, detection of a time series anomaly). Datasets integrated in the SOS service are updated in near-realtime based on the linked data providers mentioned above. An alert is automatically pushed to the user if the new data meets the conditions of the registered filter expression.

The elevation of the reclamation land is about 3m lower than the lake water level. It suggests water flow in the underground between the lake and land would have the stable direction from the lake to the land. Because the eutrophication often occurs in Hachiro-gata Lake, the nutrient would be accumulated in sediment. We installed three piezometers at the bankside of the lake and reclamation land, respectively. The water levels were monitored from September to December in 2013 and May to August in 2014. In addition, water samples were collected in September and December in 2013, May in 2014. We confirmed water flow from the lake to the land with the hydraulic gradient from 0.05 to 0.1. In addition, DOC and phosphorus concentrations of groundwater were higher in the land than in the lake water. The lake water has recently eutrophic condition, and so many organic matter originated from phytoplankton are deposited. The porewater in the lake sediment near the bank had the high nutrient and DOC concentrations. Based on this research, we can make a hypothesis of nutrient transport from the lake to the land with groundwater flow.",

            "abstract": "The major problem of classical Wilson Cycle concept is the suggested conversion of the passive continental margin to the active subduction zone. Previous modeling studies assumed either unusually thick felsic continental crust at the margin (over 40 km) or unusually low lithospheric thickness (less than 70 km) to simulate this process.\nHere we propose a new triggering factor in subduction initiation process that is mantle suction force. Based on this proposal we suggest a modification of Wilson Cycle concept. Sometime after opening and extension of oceanic basin, continental passive margin moves over the slab remnants of the former active subduction zones in deep mantle. Such slab remnants or deep slabs of neighboring active subduction zones produce a suction mantle flow introducing additional compression at the passive margin. It results in the initiation of a new subduction zone, hence starting the closing phase of Wilson Cycle. In this scenario the weakness of continental crust near the passive margin which is inherited from the rifting phase and horizontal push force induced from far-field topographic gradient within the continent facilitate and speed up subduction initiation process.\nOur thermo-mechanical modeling shows that after a few tens of million years a shear zone may indeed develop along the passive margin that has typical two-layered 35 km thick continental crust and thermal lithosphere thicker than 100 km if there is a broad mantle down-welling flow below the margin. Soon after formation of this shear zone oceanic plate descends into mantle and subduction initiates. Subduction initiation occurs following over-thrusting of continental crust and retreating of future trench. In models without far-field topographic gradient within the continent subduction initiation requires weaker passive margin. Our results also indicate that subduction initiation depends on several parameters such as magnitude, domain size and location of suction mantle flow, thickness of continental crust and lithosphere and water content of the asthenosphere.\nWe propose that a new subduction is about to form along the Argentina passive margin as a result of mantle suction flow produced by remnants of Farallon and Phoenix slabs in deep mantle below Argentinean passive margin.",

            "abstract": "The isotopic composition of helium is often considered to be one of the key elements in resolving deep mantle plume vs. upper mantle origin of hotspot-related volcanic rocks. High 3He/4He values, greater than 10 times atmospheric (Ra), are generally thought to indicate plume-related sources in the lower mantle. The use of helium isotopes in continental flood basalt (CFB) provinces has been limited by the lack of fresh rock material, poor exposures, time-integrated ingrowth of radiogenic 4He, and strong lithospheric overprinting.\nVestfjella mountain range at western Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica, is comprised of lava flows and intrusive rocks that belong to the Jurassic (~180 Ma) Karoo continental flood basalt province, the bulk of which is exposed in southern Africa. The Karoo CFBs and related rocks show strong lithospheric influence in their geochemistry in general, but some high-Mg dikes from Vestfjella show geochemical evidence of derivation from sublithospheric sources.\nIn an attempt to determine the first estimate for the helium isotopic composition of the Karoo mantle sources, we performed He isotopic measurements on six primitive Vestfjella dike samples collected from variably exposed nunataks. Helium was extracted by in-vacuo stepwise crushing and melting of separated and carefully hand-picked olivine phenocrysts (Ø = 0.25–1 mm; ~10 000 grains in total; abraded and unabraded fractions).\nThe results of coupled crushing and melting measurements show evidence of both cosmogenic and radiogenic helium contributions within the olivines (i.e. by having high He contents and anomalously low or high 3He/4He released by melting), which complicates interpretation of the data. As a best estimate for the mantle isotopic composition, we use the sample with the highest amount of He released (> 50%) during the first crushing step of an abraded coarse fraction, which gave 3He/4He of 7.03 ± 0.23 (2σ) Ra. This value is indistinguishable from those measured from Southwest Indian Ridge MORBs (Ra = 6.3‒7.3), the modern successor of the Africa-Antarctica rift zone. These new helium data are compatible with previous trace element and Sr, Nd, Pb, and Os isotopic analyses that indicate the involvement of a depleted upper mantle source in Karoo CFB petrogenesis.",

Tremor is commonly detected associated with slow slip event on the subducting plate interface at the downdip part of the megathrust seismogenic zone. Spatio-temporal distribution of tremor has been well investigated to get a general feature of tremor activity. However, more detailed characteristics may be revealed by estimating tremor energy through densely observed seismic traces, which considerably contribute for understandings of megathrust earthquakes.\nTo estimate total tremor energy as accurate as possible, we first measured time duration segment of tremor by systematic multi-station analysis. The tremor element was located every one minute by using the envelope correlation method and the duration segment was searched around each origin time of the tremor element. The duration with amplitude simultaneously higher than the noise level at some stations was extracted. If the duration continued longer than two hours, it was separated. Then one or two source location was determined by applying clustering process to each duration segment using hypocenters of tremor elements. Finally, we estimated tremor energy for each duration segment.\nBy analyzing continuous seismograms at western Shikoku area in southwestern Japan for 1 year in 2012, we obtained characteristic spatial distribution of tremor energy. Larger energy was concentrated with a length of about 20km at the updip part of tremor zone. It has been already known that there are two peaks of the number of tremor along the dip direction. The spatial distribution of energy of tremor is different with that of the number of tremor. Concentrated energy at the updip part suggests that the updip part is relatively more brittle in the brittle-ductile transition zone.",

The contribution of the surface momentum forcing to the ocean vertical baroclinic mode is important. We examined the changes in the relationship of oceanic vertical baroclinic mode-ENSO, and recent changes in warm pool SST and its linkage with ocean stratification. The mean SST over the western Pacific warm pool, where the wind stress variation is small, has experienced a shift from cool state to warm state in recent decades. Increased SST enhances the vertical stratification at the upper level. The warm pool SST variability is highly correlated with the change in maximum buoyancy frequency which is captured by the wind stress variations projecting onto the first baroclinic mode over the warm pool region. The ocean stratification change over the warm pool region, which is related to the changes in wind stress forcing projecting onto the oceanic baroclinic modes, might contribute to change in El Niño structure in the observation during recent decades.",

Using the Korean icebreaker R/V Araon, the multi-disciplinary research team collected bathymetry, gravity, magnetics, and rock and water column samples. In addition, Miniature Autonomous Plume Recorders (MAPRs) were deployed at wax-core rock sampling sites to detect the presence of active hydrothermal vents. Here we present a detailed analysis of a 300-km-long supersegment of the AAR to quantify the spatial variations in ridge morphology and robust axial and off-axis volcanisms. The ridge axis morphology alternates between rift valleys and axial highs within relatively short ridge segments. To obtain a geological proxy for regional variations in magma supply, we calculated residual mantle Bouguer gravity anomalies (RMBA), gravity-derived crustal thickness, and residual topography for seven sub-segments. The results of the analyses revealed that the southern flank of the AAR is associated with shallower seafloor, more negative RMBA, thicker crust, and/or less dense mantle than the conjugate northern flank. Furthermore, this north-south asymmetry becomes more prominent toward the KR1 supersegment of the AAR. The axial topography of the KR1 supersegment exhibits a sharp transition from axial highs at the western end to rift valleys at the eastern end, with regions of axial highs being associated with more magma supply as indicated by more negative RMBA. We also compare and contrast the characteristics of the AAR supersegment with that of other ridges of intermediate spreading rates, including the Juan de Fuca Ridge, Galápagos Spreading Center, and Southeast Indian Ridge west of the Australian-Antarctic Discordance, to investigate the influence of ridge-hotspot interaction on ridge magma supply and tectonics.",

The eruption was one of the largest of the Holocene and has been recorded in ice cores in both hemispheres from sulfate and acidity measurements. The estimate of its sulfate load varies from 2 to 8 times that of Tambora. This is also the only volcano for which tephras have been assigned in ice cores from both Antarctica and Greenland (GISP2). Due to this unique assignment of a bipolar tephra layer in ice cores, the origins of the sulfate and tephras have been disputed and it has been proposed that at least one of the tephras was due to an additional volcanic eruption local to either Greenland or Antarctica.\nWe have re-evaluated the acid and tephra deposition from the 1257 AD volcano in two ice cores, one from Greenland (NGRIP. 75.1° N, 42.3° W) and one from Antarctica (RICE, Roosevelt Island. 79.36° S, -161.71° W). Annually-resolved continuous flow analysis (CFA) measurements determined relevant parameters such as melt water conductivity, sulphate and acidity. The acidity peak at RICE (~20 uM H+) is approximately double that found at NGRIP (10 uM H+). The only visible tephra layer found in the corresponding depth range was deposited at 1250 AD, 9 years before the acidity peak. The high resolution of the data offers a precise evaluation of the delay between the deposition of tephra and acid (sulfate) in each hemisphere. The comparison between poles allows some evaluation of the spread of deposition from the volcanic eruption.",

To make physical concepts more accessible and relevant to students majoring in environmental science, an environmental physics course was developed at Cornell University and offered for the first time during spring 2014. Principles of radiation, thermodynamics, and mechanics were introduced and applied to the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere to describe energy and mass transfers in natural and built environments.\nEnvironmental physics was designed as a flipped course where students viewed online material outside of class and worked in groups in class to solve sustainability problems. Experiential learning, just-in-time teaching, and peer collaboration strategies were also utilized. In-class problems were drawn from both local and global environmental sustainability concerns. Problems included an investigation of Cornell’s lake source cooling system, calculations on the energy consumed in irrigation with groundwater in the southwestern United States, and power generated by wind turbines at various locations around the world.\nClass attendance was high, with at least 84% of students present at each meeting. Survey results suggest that students enjoyed working in groups and found the in-class problems helpful for assimilating the assigned material. However, some students reported that the workload was too heavy and they preferred traditional lectures to the flipped classroom. The instructors were able to actively engage with students and quickly identify knowledge and skill gaps that needed to be addressed. Overall, the integration of current environmental problems and group work into an introductory physics course could help to inspire and motivate students as they advance their ability to analyze problems quantitatively.",

            "abstract": "Future water availability is one of key social issues under ongoing climate change. Since 70% of human water abstraction is for irrigational use, accurate evaluation of irrigational water is highly desirable for reliable estimation of water demand. However, recent studies on future hydrological environments projected by different impact models showed that there are substantial differences in their results between the models. A large part of the differences is considered to be attributable to different calculation schemes implemented by different impact models and input data driving the models. To obtain more reliable future projections, it is crucial to identify possible sources of these differences in both meteorological data sets and the impact models.\nWe investigated possible sources of uncertainty in quantitative evaluation of irrigational water with a global hydrological model, H08. Since irrigational water is primarily lost from croplands via evapotranspiration, we focus on uncertainties in data of the atmospheric humidity, a major determinant of evapotranspiration, generated by general circulation models (GCMs). In fact, although great attention has been paid for GCM biases in the temperature and precipitation in most climate impact studies, less attention has been paid for GCM biases in the humidity. To evaluate propagation of uncertainty in humidity data into irrigational water withdrawal, we used bias-corrected meteorological data, for all meteorological elements but for the humidity, of five GCMs (GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-LR, MIROC-ESM-CHEM and NorESM1-M).  \nWe detected differences of over 10%RH between the GCMs in monthly humidity data averaged over irrigated croplands over the world. Estimation of annual global irrigational water withdrawal from the five GCMs ranges 1,218-1,341 km3/yr. We made sensitivity analysis by adding hypothetical humidity biases of 5%RH to the GCM humidity data; annual global irrigational water withdrawal would be changed by 3-4 %, corresponding to 40-50 km3/yr, at largest. In regions where water availability is limited, small uncertainties in water withdrawal may cause significant uncertainties in water scarcity levels. To improve future projections of irrigational water, we should pay much attention in accuracy in humidity data generated by GCMs.",

            "abstract": "Analogue models predict that multiphase rifts which have experienced a change in extension direction between stretching phases will typically develop non-colinear normal fault sets and hence will display a greater frequency and range of styles of fault interactions than single-phase rifts. We test these model-based predictions by studying a natural fault network in the northern Horda Platform, northern North Sea using an integrated 3D seismic reflection and borehole dataset. We focus on the >60 km long, N-S-striking Tusse fault that has over 500 m of throw and was active in the Permian-Triassic and again in the Late Jurassic-to-Early Cretaceous. The Tusse Fault forms part of a non-colinear fault network that also comprises numerous smaller (2-10 km long), lower throw (<100 m) and predominantly NW-SE-striking faults that were only active during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous. We examine how the second-stage NW-SE-striking faults have grown and interacted with the N-S-striking Tusse Fault, noting a range of end-member styles of interaction including: i) no interaction; ii) hanging-wall abutting; iii) footwall abutting; iv) cross-cutting; and v) hybrid. To constrain the nucleation and growth history of each of these interaction styles, we systematically apply throw-versus-length (T-x) plots, throw-versus-depth plots (T-z) and 3D throw contouring. This quantitative 3D analysis of the fault network demonstrates: i) pre-existing (first-stage) faults can act as sites of nucleation for second-stage faults; ii) abutting relationships are common and can develop by second-stage faults nucleating either at, or away from pre-existing faults; iii) the throw distribution on reactivated first-stage faults will be modified in a predictable manner if they are intersected or influenced by second-stage faults; and iv) fault segment boundaries, and fault kinks or corrugations along first-stage faults, can act as preferential nucleation sites for second-stage faults, and facilitate the development of complex cross-cutting relationships. In addition to furthering our fundamental understanding of the geometric and kinematic evolution of rift-related normal faults, our results also have broader implications for understanding the physiographic and tectono-stratigraphic evolution of multiphase rift basins.",

            "abstract": "Agricultural droughts are defined as water storage deficit in the soil. They have the potential to diminish crop yields causing economic damage or even threatening the livelihood of societies. State-of-the-art drought forecasting systems incorporate seasonal meteorological forecasts to estimate future drought conditions. Meteorological forecasting skill, however, in particular that of precipitation, is limited to a few weeks because of the chaotic behaviour of the atmosphere. One of the most important challenges in drought forecasting is to understand how the uncertainty in the atmospheric forcings (e.g., precipitation and temperature) is further propagated into hydrologic variables such as soil moisture. In this study, we analyse the skill of the North-American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME), which provides the latest collection of a multi-institutional seasonal forecasting ensemble, for correctly estimating the major drought events (in a retrospective mode) over Europe.\nThe monthly NMME forecasts are downscaled to daily values to force the mesoscale hydrological model (mHM). The forecasts provided by these dynamical models using mHM are then compared to that of a simple statistical forecasting model. This statistical model uses geo-potential height and antecedent soil moisture conditions to provide future soil moisture estimates and is used here as a benchmark. Both forecasts are compared against reference soil moisture conditions obtained by observation based meteorological forcings for the period from 1981 to 2010. The study area ranges roughly from 10°W to 40°E and 35°N to 55°N, and covers large parts of the Pan-European domain.\nResults indicate that the drought forecast by most dynamic models is underestimating the observed drought extent for the most severe events (e.g., 2003), but are outperforming the statistical model. The spatial pattern is in general well represented by the NMME models with anomaly correlations higher than 0.6 for lead times up to seven months. The forecast issued by the NCEP-CFSv2 model shows the highest skill among all models for lead times up to five months. In summary, this study shows the potential of NMME seasonal forecasts for skilful predictions of drought events over Europe.",

            "abstract": "The relative movement between two divergent rigid plates on a sphere can be described using a Euler pole and an angular velocity. On Earth, this typically results in extensional velocities increasing linearly as a function of the distance from the pole (for example in the South Atlantic, North Atlantic, Woodlark Basin, Red Sea Basin, etc.).\nThis property has strong implications for continental rifting and the formation of passive margins, given the role that extensional velocity plays on both rift style (wide or narrow), fault pattern, subsidence histories, and magmatism.\nUntil now, this scissor-style opening has been approached via suites of 2D numerical models of contrasting extensional velocities, complimenting field geology and geophysics. New advances in numerical modelling tools and computational hardware have enabled us to investigate the geodynamics of this problem in a 3D self-consistent high-resolution context. Using Underworld at a grid resolution of 2 km over a domain of 500 km x 500 km x 180 km, we have explored the role of the velocity gradient on the strain pattern, style of rifting, and decompression melting, along the margin.\nWe find that the three dimensionality of this problem is important. The rise of the asthenosphere is enhanced in 2D models compared to 3D numerical solutions, due to the limited volume of material available in 2D. This leads to oceanisation occurring significantly sooner in 2D models. The 3D model shows that there is a significant time and space dependent flows parallel to the rift-axis. A similar picture emerges from the stress field, showing time and space partitioning, including regions of compression separating areas dominated by extension. The strain pattern shows strong zonation along the rift axis, with increasingly localised deformation with extension velocity and though time.",

            "abstract": "Land subsidence in Shanghai caused by overly exploitation of ground water has been 93 years since 1921, with the largest cumulative land subsidence of 2.6m. Studies on controlling and alleviating land subsidence have been 53 years since 1961. Control on ground water exploitation, change in pumping aquifers, increase in artificial recharge have been used as the three measures to mitigate land subsidence. The amount of ground water exploitation decreased from 0.2 billion m3 in 1963 to 13 million m3, which meant the amount decreased by 93.5%. The amount of artificial recharge increased from 1.9 million m3 in 1963 to 18 million m3 in 2011, which meant it increased by 9.5 times. The amount of recharge was even 6 million m3 larger than the discharge. The main pumping aquifers were shift from the second and third confined aquifers to the fourth and fifth confined aquifers. With the application of the three measures, ground water levels in second and third confined aquifers increased from -20m in 1965 to -1m in 2011 and that in the fourth confined aquifer increased from -36m in 1998 to -9m in 2011. Some regional ground water drawdown cones disappeared. Land subsidence rate reduces from 38mm/year before 1965 to 7mm/year by now and some areas even rebound. The details of measures taken to control land subsidence between 1961 and 2011, and the responses in ground water flows and land subsidence characteristics are introduced. It concludes that decrease in ground water pumping is the most effective way to control land subsidence, increase in artificial recharge is a good assistant measure, and changing in pumping aquifers is not always show good results. Shanghai got increased land subsidence rate from 1990 to 2000 when changing pumping aquifers from the second and third to the fourth and fifth ones without properly evaluating the amount of exploitation in advance. It must be very careful when take the measure of changing pumping aquifers, and the proper amount of pumpage in the new aquifers should be evaluated by land subsidence models. Analysis of measures taken to control land subsidence in Shanghai and the final results could be valuable experience to refer for other areas with land subsidence problems.\nAcknowledgement: Funding supported by NSF of China No. 41272259 and NSF of Jiangsu Province No. BK2012730 is appreciated.",

The hypocenter parameters determined by the Indian Meteorological Department shows that the epicentre is at 27.7°N, 88.2°E and focal depth of 58Km, located closed to the north-western terminus of Tista lineament. The reported aftershocks are linearly distributed in between Tista and Golapara lineament. The microscopic and geomorphologic studies infer a dextral strike-slip faulting, possibly along a NW-SE oriented fault. Landslides caused by this earthquake are distributed along Tista lineament . On the basis of the aftershock distribution, Kumar et al. (2012), have suggested possible NW orientation of the causative fault plane. The epicentral region of Sikkim bordered by Nepal, Bhutan and Tibet, comprises a segment of relatively lower level seismicity in the 2500km stretch of the active Himalayan Belt. The north Sikkim earthquake was felt in most parts of Sikkim and eastern Nepal; it killed more than 100 people and caused damage to buildings, roads and communication infrastructure.\nThrough this study we focus on the earthquake source parameters and the kinematic rupture process of this particular event. We used tele-seismic body waveformsto determine the rupture pattern of earthquake. The seismic-rupture pattern are generally complex, and the result could be interpreted in terms of a distribution of asperities and barriers on the particular fault plane (Kikuchi and Kanamori, 1991).The methodology we adopted is based on the teleseismic body wave inversion methodology by Kikuchi and Kanamori (1982, 1986 and 1991). We used tele-seismic P-wave records observed at teleseismic distances between 50° and 90° with a good signal to noise ratio. Teleseismic distances in the range between 50° and 90° were used, in order to avoid upper mantle and core triplications and to limit the path length within the crust. Synthetic waveforms were generated gives a better fit with triangular source time function duration, in order to determine the components of the moment tensor and the focal depth of the main shock. we will discussing the average stress drop and the possible mechanisms on the depth of the event at a region well known for events beyond moho transsion zone.",

In this study, we show how Arctic sea-ice loss and cold winters in extra-polar regions are dynamically connected through the polar stratosphere. We find that decreased sea-ice cover during early winter months (November– December), especially over the Barents–Kara seas, enhances the upward propagation of planetary-scale waves with wavenumbers of 1 and 2, subsequently weakening the stratospheric polar vortex in mid-winter (January–February). The weakened polar vortex preferentially induces a negative phase of Arctic Oscillation at the surface, resulting in low temperatures in mid-latitudes.",

            "abstract": "The response of benthic foraminifera to the Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/Pg) impact event is key to reconstruct paleoenvironmental changes and the specific mechanisms triggering faunal turnover in the marine realm, especially because this group did not suffer significant extinction (thus shows a continuous record across the boundary), and because its faunal turnover shows paleobiogeographic differences that remain to be explained.\nThe K/Pg transition was cored along a depth transect on ODP Leg 208 (Walvis Ridge, eastern South Atlantic Ocean), where the K/Pg boundary is marked by a sharp transition from Maastrichtian clay-bearing nannofossil ooze to Danian dark reddish to brown, clay-rich nannofossil-ooze and clay. We analysed the benthic foraminiferal turnover at Sites 1262 (upper abyssal paleodepth; present depth 4755 m) and 1267 (lower bathyal; present depth 4355 m). The record at 1267 appears to be more complete than at 1262, especially the interval just at the K/Pg boundary (Westerhold et al. 2008).\nThe percentage of infaunal taxa (living buried within the sediment) was slightly lower at Site 1262 than at Site 1267, as expected for a deeper, more oligotrophic setting where the scarce food available is preferentially taken up by epifaunal morphogroups. The dominance of calcareous taxa suggests that both sites were located above the CCD throughout the K/Pg transition. Benthic assemblages from both sites are similar, but the species Tappanina eouvigeriniformis is common at Site 1267, as at lower bathyal Southern Ocean Site 690, but is absent at Site 1262.\nExtinction rates across the K/Pg boundary were very low at both sites. Morphogroup composition did not significantly change across the boundary at Site 1262, but the increase in % infaunal morphogroups and benthic foraminiferal accumulation rates at Site 1267 point to an enhanced food supply immediately after the impact. These results suggest that a short interval is missing from the lowermost Danian at Site 1262.",

Such large scale fluid relocation would cause similar modifications of the associated deep electrical resistivity structure. In this paper, we examine feasibility to detect such changes in the deep hydraulic system with magnetotelluric monitoring. Continuous magnetotelluric (MT) data have been recorded above the subduction zone in northern Chile as part of the Integrated Plate Boundary Observatory Chile (IPOC) with an array of 9 stations since 2007.\nWith the MT method, electrical resistivity and lateral changes of the resistivity structure are estimated from so called transfer functions (TF). If the subsurface resistivity structure is stable, these TFs vary only within their statistical significance intervals over time. Any statistically significant deviations, particularly when observed over the network of sites, must be originated from a change in the subsurface resistivity structure. We simulate the effects of such changes on the TFs using 3D forward modelling studies. The background model is based on 3D inversion of the IPOC MT stations. The results show that detectable differences in the TFs are obtained if the resistivity decreases by 5 times of its original value in the lower continental crust over the rupture zone. The implications of these results are compared with observed changes in the TFs after the 2007 Mw 7.7 Tocopilla and 2014 Mw 8.2 Pisagua earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Laser ranging is an emerging technology for tracking interplanetary missions, offering improved range accuracy and precision (mm-cm), compared to existing DSN tracking. The ground segment uses existing Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) technology, whereas the space segment is modified with an active system. In a one-way system, such as that currently being used on the LRO spacecraft (Zuber et al., 2010), only an active detector is required on the spacecraft. For a two-way system, such as that tested by using the laser altimeter system on the MESSENGER spacecraft en route to Mercury (Smith et al., 2006), a laser transmitter system is additionally placed on the space segment, which will asynchronously fire laser pulses towards the ground stations. Although the one-way system requires less hardware, clock errors on both the space and ground segments will accumulate over time, polluting the range measurements. For a two-way system, the range measurements are only sensitive to clock errors integrated over the the two-way light time.\nWe investigate the performance of both one- and two-way laser range systems by simulating their operation. We generate realizations of clock error time histories from Allan variance profiles, and use them to create range measurement error profiles. We subsequently perform the orbit determination process from this data to quanitfy the system's performance. For our simulations, we use two test cases: a lunar orbiter similar to LRO and a Phobos lander similar to the Phobos Laser Ranging concept (Turyshev et al., 2010). For the lunar orbiter, we include an empirical model for unmodelled non-gravitational accelerations in our truth model to include errors ihe dynamics. We include the estimation of clock parameters over a number of arc lengths for our simulations of the one-way range system and use a variety of state arc durations for the lunar orbiter simulations.\nWe perform Monte Carlo simulations and generate true error distributions for both missions for various combinations of clock and state arc length. Thereby, we quantify the relative capabilities of the one- and two-way laser range systems. In addition, we study the optimal data analysis strategies for these missions, which we apply for LRO orbit determination. Finally, we compare the performance of the laser ranging systems with typical DSN tracking.",

            "abstract": "The roughness of subducting plates is one of the most important parameters controlling the seismogenic behavior of subduction megathrusts, but in most regions the distribution of subducting relief is inferred from structure seaward of trenches. Spectral averaging techniques developed to remove the steep topographic gradients across forearcs are shown to improve resolution of local trench-slope uplift, that may be diagnostic of subducting relief. This interpretation is locally calibrated where the Louisville Ridge subducts at the Tonga trench. From a global extension of these techniques, >200 residual bathymetric anomalies are identified, enabling links between subducting relief, slip behavior and seismicity to be reconsidered. We interpret >150 potential subducting seamounts, 36 of which have height ≥1 km and area ≥500 km2. These anomalies are similar in wavelength, amplitude and morphology with unsubducted seamounts, are associated with aseismic regions in Tonga and Mariana, and prevented along strike rupture propagation in large recent earthquakes in Java (2006) and Japan (2011). Subducting aseismic ridges in Peru, Ecuador and Costa-Rica are associated with uplift and steepening of the outer-forearc and a local increase in the width and elevation of the volcanic-arc. Associations with complex large earthquakes, higher frequencies of small events, and creep suggest aseismic ridges may also subduct via the development and evolution of an adjacent fracture network. Megathrust complexity is expected to be greatest on subducting ridge flanks. The bathymetric expression of subducting relief is strongest near the trench (<70 km) and above shallow slab depths (<~17 km). Dip-parallel transitions in the surface expression of aseismic ridges may reflect physical transitions in megathrust slip-behavior and/or material properties in the overthrusting wedge. Aseismic ridges and seamounts represent seafloor roughness over different wavelengths and are associated with contrasting modes of isostatic compensation. Consideration of these differences, coupled with improved knowledge of where subducting bathymetric features are likely within seismogenic zones, may reconcile some debated aspects of the mechanics and seismological consequences of bathymetric relief subduction.",

In this paper, we present a clear evidence that the magnetic fluctuations are the spatial structures of small scale field-aligned currents along satellite orbit. By using the data obtained during initial one month when the SWARM-A and SWARM-B were flying on almost the same orbit with gradually increasing separation, we try to estimate the temporal scale of variation of the field-aligned currents. We compare the period with the possible magnetic signature of the field-aligned current system observed on the ground.",

            "abstract": "PM2.5 has become one of the most important aspects in recent air pollution issues. In Japan, the achievement rate of the environmental quality standard for PM2.5 is in a worse situation so far (43.3% for ambient air monitoring station, 33.3% for roadside air pollution monitoring station in FY2012). Therefore, source apportionment will be essential to policy and decision making for improving the PM2.5 pollution.\nSince 2011, we started the field monitoring study called “Current Status Elucidation and Source Contribution Assessment of PM2.5 Pollution in Collaboration with Environmental Research Institutes across Japan” which was granted by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (5B-1101) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan. PM2.5 samples were collected at 14 sites during four campaigns. Chemical analyses of carbonaceous compounds, ionic species, and elements were conducted.\nSource apportionment was performed by using Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF, EPA PMF 3.0) and Chemical Mass Balance (CMB, EPA CMB 8.1) models. PMF model resolved a six-factor solution. Each of these factors has a distinctive grouping of species that can be associated with a specific source sector (F1: Biomass burning, F2: Sulfate + Oil combustion, F3: Industry, F4: Nitrate, F5: Sulfate + Coal combustion, and F6: Chloride). In the winter campaign (Jan. 24 to Feb. 7) in 2013, F5 accounted for 50% of total PM2.5 mass at Tsushima (34.2°N 129.3°E, the westernmost remote site). The contribution of F5 tended to decrease toward the eastern sites (27% at Fukuoka (33.5°N 130.5°E, urban site), 22% at Higashi-Osaka (34.7°N 135.6°E, urban site)). CMB model showed similar results in the same campaign. Coal combustion accounted for 49%, 30%, and 22% of total PM2.5 mass at Tsushima, Fukuoka, and Higashi-Osaka, respectively (Fig.1). On the other hand, at urban sites, higher contributions from local sources such as secondary nitrate (16% at Fukuoka, 21% at Higashi-Osaka), diesel fuel automobile (11% at Fukuoka, 12% at Higashi-Osaka), and waste incineration (7% at Fukuoka, 14% at Higashi-Osaka) were observed. This study clearly shows that the effects from the local sources are also important at the urban sites in Japan, while the impact of transboundary pollution from the Asian Continent has attracted a lot of attention in recent years.",

            "abstract": "The surface reflectance is crucial for the quantitative analysis of land surface properties in geological, agricultural and urban studies. The first requirement for a reliable surface reflectance estimation is an accurate atmospheric correction obtained by an appropriate selection of aerosol loading and type. The aerosol optical thickness at 550nm is widely used to describe the aerosol loading. Recent works have highlighted the relevant role of the aerosol types on the atmospheric correction process defined by their micro-physical properties. The aim of this work is to evaluate the radiative impact of the aerosol type on the surface reflectance obtained from CHRIS (Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) hyperspectral data over land. CHRIS on PROBA satellite is an high resolution multi-angular imaging spectrometer, operating in the visible near-infrared spectral domain (400 to 1000 nm). As test case the urban site of Brussels has been selected. The physically-based algorithm CHRIS@CRI (CHRIS Atmospherically Corrected Reflectance Imagery) has been developed specifically for CHRIS data by using the vector version of 6S (6SV) radiative transfer model. The atmospheric data needed for the atmospheric correction were obtained from CIMEL CE-318 of the Brussels AERONET station. CHRIS images were selected if simultaneous AERONET data were available. Other specific requirements for imagery acquisition were high aerosol loading and high solar irradiation. The aerosol radiative impact has been investigated comparing the reflectance obtained by applying the CHRIS@CRI algorithm with different aerosol types: the three aerosol standard of 6SV and two characterized by specific microphysical properties provided by the AERONET station and calculated with FlexAOD code (a post-processing tool of the chemical transport model GEOS-Chem), respectively. The results show a clear dependence of the atmospheric correction results on the aerosol absorption properties.",

            "abstract": "The Improved Hodograph Method (IHM below) and the Amplitude-Phase Gradient Method (APGM below) are both applied to data from two ground magnetometers latitudinally separated by ~100km and yield the field-line-resonance (FLR) frequency and the ionospheric resonance width as functions of the latitude; from the FLR frequency we can estimate the magnetospheric plasma mass density, and from the resonance width we can estimate the damping rate of FLR, which is related to how much of the FLR-generated ULF waves are absorbed by the ionosphere.\nThe both methods apply FFT to the two magnetometers' data, and calculate the amplitude ratio and the cross phase from the two stations' data as functions of the frequency. From there the two methods use different approaches: IHM fits a curve to the obtained ratio (as a complex number including both the amplitude ratio and the cross phase) on the complex plane to separate out the non-FLR signal in the data, while APGM assumes that the obtained amplitude ratio and cross phase include the FLR signal only and obtains the FLR frequency and the resonance width in an algebraic manner.\nIn this paper we apply the two methods to simultaneously observed data from ground station pairs of WAD (CGM latitude and longitude: 61.3 and 318.3) - WEYB (58.6, 320.9), LGRR (61.8, 332.4) - PINA (60.0, 331.8), and PINA - THRF (57.8, 331.5), where WAD belongs to MAGDAS/CPMN while the other four belong to CARISMA. We show that IHM can properly estimate the latitudinal profile of the resonance width (which is the improved point of IHM over the original Hodograph Method) by comparing the results of applying IHM to the LGRR-PINA and PINA-THRF pairs, located along the same meridian. We also compare the IHM and APGM results to support the above-stated advantage of IHM over APGM. In addition, comparing the results of applying IHM and APGM to WAD-WEYB and LGRR-PINA-THRF, having similar latitudes but different longitudes, we discuss the longitude dependence of the FLR frequency (from which we can estimate the magnetospheric plasma density on the meridional plane including the ground station pair) and the resonance width.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic is warming dramatically, with potentially catastrophic impacts on climate change through rapid mobilization of labile carbon reservoirs sequestered presently in permafrost. Increasingly, Arctic feedbacks are recognized as key contributors to climate change, including cycles associated with the powerful greenhouse gas methane, whose atmospheric concentration has more than doubled since the pre-industrial epoch. Sustained methane release to the atmosphere from thawing Arctic permafrost and delivery to the coastal ocean through groundwater or riverine discharge or expulsion from the seabed is a positive and likely highly significant feedback to climate warming. Microbially-mediated methane oxidation provides a key sink and effective biofilter that can limit methane fluxes from coastal environments to the atmosphere. We examined methane dynamics on the East Siberian Arctic Shelf by determining concentrations and oxidation rates at a series of stations near the Lena River Delta and moving offshore. Methane concentrations and oxidation rates were highly elevated in and near the river mouth compared to offshore waters, except when the offshore waters were impacted by seabed methane seepage. The regulation of methane oxidation in Arctic waters appears two-fold: first, rates are strongly related to methane availability and second, in the presence of methane, nutrient availability strongly regulates methane consumption. Along the Lena river delta, elevated concentrations of both nutrients and methane create ideal conditions to support high rates of pelagic methanotrophy. Offshore, where nutrient concentrations are lower and more limiting, methane oxidation rates are considerably lower. These data suggest that, at present, nearshore waters are fairly efficient methane sinks while in offshore waters, pelagic methanotrophy is inefficient, allowing methane to escape to the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "To quantify impact of the climate change on a specific pest (or any weather-dependent process) in a specific site, we may use a site-calibrated pest (or other) model and compare its outputs obtained with site‑specific weather data representing present vs. perturbed climates. The input weather data may be produced by the stochastic weather generator. Apart from the quality of the pest model, the reliability of the results obtained in such experiment depend on an ability of the generator to represent the statistical structure of the real world weather series, and on the sensitivity of the pest model to possible imperfections of the generator.\nThis contribution deals with the multivariate HOWGH weather generator, which is based on a combination of parametric and non‑parametric statistical methods. Here, HOWGH is used to generate synthetic hourly series of three weather variables (solar radiation, temperature and precipitation) required by a dynamic pest model SOPRA to simulate the development of codling moth.\nThe contribution presents results of the direct and indirect validation of HOWGH. In the direct validation, the synthetic series generated by HOWGH (various settings of its underlying model are assumed) are validated in terms of multiple climatic characteristics, focusing on the subdaily wet/dry and hot/cold spells. In the indirect validation, we assess the generator in terms of characteristics derived from the outputs of SOPRA model fed by the observed vs. synthetic series.\nThe weather generator may be used to produce weather series representing present and future climates. In the latter case, the parameters of the generator may be modified by the climate change scenarios based on Global or Regional Climate Models. To demonstrate this feature, the results of codling moth simulations for future climate will be shown.\nAcknowledgements: The weather generator is developed and validated within the frame of projects WG4VALUE (project LD12029 sponsored by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of CR), and VALUE (COST ES 1102 action).",

            "abstract": "Chemical Abrasion Isotope-Dilution Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry (CA-ID-TIMS) is known as a high precision technique for resolving lead loss and improving the interpretation of U–Pb zircon age data. We argue that combining CA with the widely applied Laser Ablation-Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) improves the precision and accuracy of zircon dates, while removing the substantial parts with lead loss, reducing data scatter, and providing meaningful geological interpretations. The samples are magmatic rocks chosen from diﬀerent geological time periods (Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic time). All zircon separates are analysed by LA-ICP-MS before and after CA, and all age data are compared with CA-ID-TIMS 206Pb/238U dates that are considered as the most accurately age. All CA-treated zircon crystals show up to 50% less data scatter compared to the non-CA treated zircon grains and thus a reduction of the calculated uncertainties is apparent. The obtained wt average LA-ICP-MS 206Pb/238U ages of the CA-treated zircon grains are up to 4–6% higher than those of the non-CA treated crystals, exceeding the analytical uncertainties of the LA-ICP-MS dating technique of 1–2%. The damaged crystal parts, caused by U-decay, with lead loss are removed, so that we can exclude younging from the possible geological scenarios. CA-LA-ICP-MS age data are in good agreement with the CA-ID-TIMS dates and suggest advantages of using CA-LA-ICP-MS in order to deﬁne accurate ages. The use of the CA technique for very young zircons (~0.2 Ma, Kos rhyolitic tuﬀ, Greece) seems optional; as the obtained mean 206Pb/238U ages of non-CA and CA treated zircons coincide within the uncertainty. The negligible time to produce the lattice damage (based on alpha decay or spontaneous ﬁssion) makes lead loss less important for age dating and data interpretation of very young zircons (<1 Ma).\nVon Quadt, A. et al., 2014, JAAS, doi: 10.1039/c4ja00102h.",

During T-I, the Sulawesi speleothem δ18O shows a few millennial-scale events, possibly a drier climate during the Younger Dryas (YD) and Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1), but a relatively wet climate during the last glacial maximum (LGM) and the Bolling-Allerod (B-A). The pattern resembles those registered in the speleothem records from eastern China and Borneo. However, the Sulawesi d18O varies from ~ -5.8‰ to ~ -7.3‰ during the last termination, which is much smaller than the magnitudes shown in China and Borneo cave samples (~ 4‰). On the other hand, the Sulawesi cave record is anti-correlated with the Flores speleothem record in terms of their millennial-scale events. Yet, the two Indonesian records share a similar, small d18O variation (~1.5‰). Such observations therefore suggest that the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) probably became narrower when responding to the northern high-latitude climatic forcing during the T-I, and it centered zonally between the two Indonesian locations.\nInterestingly, Sulawesi speleothem d18O has a larger magnitude of shift during T-V, from ~ -5.7‰ in MIS12 to ~ -8.7‰ at the peak of MIS11. Given that Sulawesi cave d18O is not sensitive to sea level change and orbital forcing, we suspect that a much lower d18O observed in MIS11 could be attributed to a higher temperature in the IPWP accompanying with a regional higher rainfall.",

            "abstract": "The coseismic deformation due to the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake (M9.0) is characterized essentially by tremendous east-west extension, which is completely opposite from the strain field in the inter-seismic period in Northeastern Japan Arc. The postseismic deformation is still dominant at present even though more than 3 years have passed. These cataclysms result in the induced seismic activity and the minor unrest of some volcanoes in the arc. The detailed study on the postseismic deformation, therefore, is a key to unravel the physical process ongoing beneath the area.\nThe continuous GNSS data obtained by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (GSI) and Tohoku University were analyzed using the Precise Point Positioning strategy of GIPSY-OASIS II (Zumberge et al., 1997, JGR) to produce daily site coordinates, which were then converted to strain components utilizing the method of Shen et al. (1996, JGR).\nResulting areal strain distribution in 2013 is characterized by the 2 contractile areas: the Pacific coastal area south of 39.5 degrees N, and the Ou Backbone Range (OBR) south of 40 degrees N, while the other area demonstrates expansion. The former may represent the viscoelastic deformation caused by the 2011 event, and the latter may be related to the local structural anomalies, such as the seismic velocity (Nakajima et al., 2001, Tectonophys; Brenguier et al., 2014, Sci.), and the P wave attenuation (Nakajima et al., 2013, JGR). The OBR is also proposed as a strain concentration zone based on the interseismic strain field obtained by GNSS data (Miura et al., 2004, EPS).\nInvestigating the time evolution of the postseismic strain field, we notice that the coastal contraction decreases with time, while the OBR contraction keeps its magnitude and extends its area in the north-south direction; the OBR contraction was limited between 38 and 39 degrees N in 2011, between 37.7-39.5 degrees N in 2012. These characteristics suggest the difference in the physical process.",

Since then, it has been joined by Aquarius in June 2011, and will be joined by SMAP in October 2014.\nWithin these 4 years, earth observation at L-band has gone from historical curiosity to highly repetitive constellation.\nStill, since all these instruments do not share the same technology and even principle of acquisitions, direct comparison and synergistic use of their measurements is not straightforward.\nThe objective of this paper is to propose a method to make them inter-comparable, down to a common reference. The proposed method uses SMOS as a transfer radiometer.\nThis method can be applied over different types of surfaces:\nmaking use of a stable target to assess the consistency and stability of both data sets. This is done over the area surrounding Dome Concordia in Antarctica. After careful selection and filtering, statistics of the comparison are retrieved along with long term trends in both data sets.\nOnce every so often, satellites overpass the same area within a very short time period. Due to different inclinations these alignments occur essentially along the equator, but over different surfaces, giving access to wide dynamic range in brightness temperature. These collocation will be happening at about the same frequency for Aquarius and SMAP.\nAfter careful selection, SMOS measurements is used in an innovative way - taking advantage of it accessibility to wide areas with a large range of incidence angles - to make it directly comparable to other instruments. Accounting for instrument characteristics such as real antenna patterns is also done at this step. This presentation will completely describe the method, along with examples of results when applied to compare SMOS and Aquarius measurement. Although these methods have already been presented and demonstrated, this presentation will include demonstration of use for the SMAP mission, potential benefits to all three missions. Building blocks of of a long term brightness temperature record, spanning the lifetime of the three missions will also be presented.",

Previous results have demonstrated a significant advance in our ability to determine the ocean’s general circulation. The improved gravity models provided by the GOCE mission have enhanced the resolution and sharpened the boundaries of those features and the associated geostrophic surface currents reveal improvements for all of the ocean’s current systems.\nIn this study, gravity models from GOCE are combined with the DTU13MSS mean sea surface to derive models for the Mean Dynamic Topography (MDT). Then regional analyses are carried out using in-situ observations of the geostrophic surface currents. The aim of those analyses is to evaluate the GOCE derived MDT in detail at regional scales. Subsequently, the in-situ observations are used in a regional enhancement of the estimated MDT and its associated currents. The data are combined using an optimal estimation technique such as least squares collocation, that is based on the functional relationship between the gravity field and the MDT as well as their a-priori statistical characteristics. Subsequently the results are used to derive error characteristics of the GOCE gravity models and to identify the major challenges in the recovery of the gravity field for ocean circulation studies.",

            "abstract": "Isotopic variation in ocean island basalts (OIB) is commonly explained by mixing of distinct and isolated reservoirs in the Earth’s interior (White, 1985; Zindler and Hart, 1986; Hofmann, 1997; Stracke, 2012). In early research on mantle reservoirs, the isotopic composition of OIBs was mainly explained by the mixing of depleted Mid Ocean Ridge Basalt (MORB) mantle (DMM) and three enriched reservoirs: high-µ (HIMU; µ = 238U/204Pb), Enriched Mantle 1 (EM1) and Enriched Mantle 2 (EM2) with isotopic compositions that are enriched extremes. In addition to these enriched/depleted reservoirs, the importance of reservoirs with isotopic compositions that are common and intermediate has been pointed out; these are the Focal Zone (FOZO; Hart et al., 1992), the Common component (C; Hanan and Graham, 1996), Prevalent Mantle (PREMA; Zindler and Hart, 1986) and Primitive Helium Mantle (PHEM; Farley et al., 1992). As these intermediate reservoirs could be characterized by high 3He/4He ratios, which might be suggestive of their lower mantle origin, origin(s) of these reservoirs should the important for better understanding of chemical evolution of Earth.\nIn this study, geochemical modeling of the origin of PREMA, FOZO and HIMU was conducted from the perspective of chemical fractionation at mid-ocean ridges and subduction zones. Chemical fractionation at a mid-ocean ridge, i.e., crystal fractionation, was estimated by comparing the chemical composition of common and differentiated MORBs, which are determined based on the magnesium number of MORBs from the Mid-Atlantic ridge and East Pacific Rise. The results suggest that the common MORBs could evolve to have isotopic signatures of the PREMA after 1-2 Ga since they have recycled back into the mantle. In contrast, high degree of dehydration of common MORBs at a subduction zone can produce FOZO isotopic signatures. Thus, the FOZO-PREMA isotopic array can be explained by the recycling of common MORBs that release various amount of water during subduction, which is consistent with the ubiquitous occurrence of OIBs on the PREMA-FOZO array. The differentiated MORBs can only produce HIMU if the amount of dehydrated water is large (~4 %). As the frequency of differentiated MORBs is much less than that of common MORBs, the rare occurrence of HIMU is reasonably well understood.",

This region presents extensive wetlands that may play an important role on the hydrology, carbon and ecological dynamics of the Congo. However, previous studies indicate that these wetlands behave differently from the Amazon, other major rainforest basin, and how water enters and leaves the Cuvette Centrale wetland is still to be quantified. We investigate the sources and sinks of water to the Congo’s wetlands. Our analyses range from simple examinations of precipitation and evaporation historical data to remote sensing datasets and 2 D hydrodynamic modelling of Congo wetlands. Early results show that water levels at wetlands are usually higher than adjacent Congo River water levels and amplitude of variation is considerably smaller. Also, floodplain channels are not observed in this region indicating that surface flows are diffusive. Mean annual precipitation range from 1600 to 2000 mm/year, evapotranspiration estimates are approximately 1100 mm/year while some estimates of groundwater recharge indicate values larger than 300 mm/year. These assessments suggest that volumes coming from local water balance could flood the wetlands to depths of only a few centimeters. Preliminary 2D hydrodynamic simulations show that water coming from main rivers produces at upstream areas can flood only a small part of wetland, mainly alongside these rivers.",

            "abstract": "The Breiðamerkurjökull glacier flows down from the Vatnajökull ice cap and it has a marine terminus in a lagoon connected to the North Atlantic Ocean. The lagoon waters have characteristics determined by the Atlantic water, subglacial run-off and the local melting of ice calved from the glacier. The lagoon is not a fjordic environment, but many similar physical processes are operating. We conducted four hydrographic sections within the lagoon to determine the effects of the ocean on the glacier. Three of the sections across the lagoon allow us to determine the pathway of Atlantic water towards the glacial ice. One hydrographic section of 16 stations along the Breiðamerkurjökull glacier face was always within 3 to 30m from the ice face. This very near ice section showed both the warmest and coldest water sampled in the lagoon. The coldest water was close to the maximum depth of our measurements and was formed through contact with the ice. A heat and salt conservation model has enabled the relative contributions of the inflowing Atlantic derived saline water, the sub glacial fresh water run-off and the melt from the ice face to be determined. Overall the dominant freshwater contribution to the lagoon in the upper 20 m is from the sub-glacial freshwater. Beneath 20 m the dominant factor is modified North Atlantic water. The contribution from melting ice is observed below 10 m, and below 40 m depth this is in layers. Individual CTD measurements show that within the layers of higher ice melt there are strong peaks of increased melt, and so there is a 3 dimensional structure to the melt. The highest resolution data we obtained show that the water at these depths is in places statically unstable.",

            "abstract": "Physical and chemical weathering govern rocks and chemical elements cycles at the Earth surface. The importance of climate and tectonics has been identified but their relative influence still needs to be investigated. We address this question by studying neodymium (Nd) isotopic composition time series in two sediment cores located on the eastern and western sides of New Zealand. The current and past climatic and oceanographic settings of this region have been already well studied, providing the underlying framework. Both detrital and authigenic phases of the sediment can be measured to decouple oceanic from continental contributions. The results show glacial-interglacial variations of the authigenic signal, with larger amplitudes for the eastern core. We propose that continental erosion on the South Island controls Nd isotopes records in both cores. Mixing calculations show that Nd discharge was 2 to 10 times higher during glacial times than during interglacials on the eastern side, whereas these variations are almost negligible on the western side. We suggest that higher physical erosion during glacial on the East, with sediments characterized by higher specific area that can be easily weathered, are due to larger ice volumes and fluxes during glacial periods. The steady rates on the western side imply that they are rather controlled by rock uplift rates. The temporal relationship between climatic indicators like oxygen isotopes and the Nd isotopic composition shows non linear response of the erosion-weathering to climate forcing. Those results contrast with previous studies using the same tracer, that showed stronger erosion and weathering over Himalaya during interglacial periods. This study illustrates the complexity of erosion and weathering responses to climatic and tectonic forcings.",

            "abstract": "Coccolithophores, a prominent group of marine calcifying unicellular algae, are widely studied in context of current and past climate change. We know that marine phytoplankton are sensitive to climatic changes, but the complex interplay of several processes such as warming, changes in nutrient content, and ocean acidification, makes future scenarios difficult to predict. Some taxa may be more susceptible to environmental perturbations than others, as evidenced by significantly different species-specific sensitivities observed in laboratory experiments. However, short-term plastic responses may not translate into longer-term climatic adaptation, nor should we readily extrapolate the behavior of single strains in the laboratory to natural, multi-species assemblages and their interactions in the ocean. The extensive fossil record of coccolithophores (in the form of coccoliths) reveals high morphological and taxonomic diversity and allows reconstructing the cell size of individual taxonomic groups. In a suite of deep-sea drilling sites from the Atlantic Ocean, we document distinct latitudinal gradients in phytoplankton composition and cell size across major climate transitions of the late Eocene – earliest Oligocene, and the middle – late Miocene. With these data we test hypotheses of species migration, phenotypic evolution, as well as the rates of species extinction and speciation in relation to concurrent paleoenvironmental changes during the Cenozoic.",

            "abstract": "High resolution ice-loading reconstructions are a vital tool not only for palaeoclimate studies, but also for providing a palaeoenvironmental context to human development. Here we present a global ice-loading history developed using the high resolution, Red Sea relative sea-level (RSL) record. (Siddall et al. 2003, Rohling et al. 2009, Grant et al. in submission)\nWe use glacial isostatic adjustment modelling to determine a set of corrections to the Red Sea RSL record, which is then translated into a global mean sea level. This global mean sea level allows us to calculate a global ice volume. Global ice volume is geographically distributed within our ice-loading history according to currently available data regarding ice margins, their timing, and constraints on maximum ice load. Where constraints are sparse we use a combination of ICE-5G (Peltier, 2004) and the de Boer coupled ice sheet model (de Boer et al, 2014) as a template for ice distribution. Although an ice-loading history for the past 5 Myr exists, this is the first time that geographic constraints have been applied to global ice volumes over 5 glacial cycles. Our ice-loading reconstruction is further supported by the high resolution of our source RSL data.\nOur ice-loading history is tested against a global compilation of coral sea-level indicators (Hibbert et al., in prep.), and compared with ice histories developed from alternate ice volume reconstructions or RSL records, including a global ice history based on that developed by de Boer et al. (2014), the sea-level record of Waelbroeck et al. (2002) and a simple ice history based on the δ18O stack of Lisiecki and Raymo (2005).",

The monthly ASR anomalies are obtained over the Arctic Ocean (65°N–90°N) from the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System during 2000–2013. The ASR anomaly changes primarily with cloud variation that determines relative contributions of cloud and surface albedo to the ASR. We found that the ASR anomaly in early summer is significantly negatively correlated with the SIC anomaly in late summer (correlation coefficient, r ≈ –0.8 with a lag of 1 to 4 months). The region exhibiting high (low) ASR anomalies and low (high) SIC anomalies varies yearly. This intimate delayed ASR-SIC relationship is not represented in most of current climate models. Rather, the models tend to over-emphasize internal sea ice processes in summer. Implication of the observed results for ice-albedo feedback will be presented.",

            "abstract": "There is a requirement for low cost in-situ measurements of environmental parameters such as air quality, meteorological data, and water quality in remote areas. Currently available solutions for such measurements include remote sensing from satellite and aircraft platforms, and in-situ measurements from mobile and aircraft platforms. Fixed systems such as eddy covariance networks, tall towers, and the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) are providing precision greenhouse gas measurements.\nWithin this context, the HUMSAT system designed by the University of Vigo (Spain) will complement existing high-precision measurement systems with low cost in-situ ground based sensors in remote locations using a constellation of CubeSats as a communications relay. The HUMSAT system standardizes radio communications in between deployed sensors and the CubeSats of the constellation, which act as store and forward satellites to ground stations for uploading to the internet. Current ground stations have been established at the University of Vigo (Spain) and California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly).\nUsers of the system may deploy their own environmental sensors to meet local requirements. The sensors will be linked to a low-cost satellite data transceiver using a standard HUMSAT protocol. The transceiver is capable of receiving data from the HUMSAT constellation to remotely reconfigure sensors without the need of physically going to the sensor location.\nThis transceiver uses a UHF channel around 437 MHz to exchange short data messages with the sensors. These data messages can contain up to 32 bytes of useful information and are transmitted at a speed around 300 bps. The protocol designed for this system handles the access to the channel by all these elements and guarantees a correct transmission of the information in such an scenario.\nThe University of Vigo has launched the first satellite of the constellation, the HUMSAT-D CubeSat in November 2013 and has deployed sensors in Spain and Brazil. Sensors will be also deployed by Cal Poly in the near future. In the following months, the SERPENS CubeSAT Mission, a joint project of the University of Brasilia and the University of Vigo will launch the second CubeSat of the constellation.",

            "abstract": "We present the first high-resolution, multichannel, seismic-reflection image for the base of an oceanic plate. Our image is based on an 85 km-long, ~ 900 station deployment across the lower North Island of New Zealand. 12 x 500 kg dynamite shots were used as seismic sources. Strong reflections at a two way travel time of 9-12 s define the top of the plate that dips to the NW at ~ 12-15 degrees. Between 27-32 s we identify a pair of reflections on some shot gathers that are interpreted to come from a reflection 90-100 km deep, that dips to the NW at 15 degrees. We interpret the reflection pair as marking a Lithosphere-Asthenosphere Boundary (LAB) zone at the base of the Pacific plate. Using all 12 shots we made a CDP-stacked image (maximum fold = 15) that shows the LAB as a double event (2-3 s apart) dipping roughly parallel to the top of the plate and Benioff zone. Shot quality varies but the highest frequencies we record from the base of the plate are ~ 18 Hz, suggesting a boundary zone < 1 km thick. Seismic amplitude attributes, calibrated to the reflection from the top of the plate, indicate P-wave speed drops off at least 8% across the LAB boundary. The double reflection at the LAB is interpreted to be a 10 km-thick layer of low seismic wave speed. Because it is so sharp it cannot be a thermal boundary and must represent some form of mechanical change. Previous attempts to explain the abruptness of seismic wave speed changes at the LAB have appealed to layered zones of ponded melt, or anelastic relaxation due to water accumulating beneath the LAB. Both mechanisms may explain our observations and both would point to low viscosity below the LAB. However, the fact we see a ~ 10 km thick channel, with strong acoustic impedances each side of the channel, suggests a shear zone where plate motion ( ~ 9 cm/y in hotspot reference frame) is taken up and strain rates of ~3 x 10-13 s-1 are generated. This interpreted, low wave-speed, low-viscosity, shear zone appears to be a key factor in allowing plates to slide with little resistance and therefore to allow plate tectonics to work.",

            "abstract": "Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) has been used in numerous fields especially related to satellite- based radio navigation system for a long time. Ionosphere, one of the upper atmosphere layers ranges from 60 km to 1500 km, is a dispersive medium and it includes a number of free electrons and ions. The ionization is mainly subject to the sun and its activity. Ionospheric activity depends also on seasonal, diurnal variations and geographical location.\nTotal Electron Content (TEC), which is also called Slant Total Electron Content (STEC), is a parameter that changes according to ionospheric conditions and has highly variable structure. Furthermore, Vertical TEC (VTEC) can be explained as TEC value in the direction of zenith. Thanks to VTEC, TEC values can be modelled. TEC is measured in units of TECU and 1TECU= 1016 electrons/m2.\nIonospheric modelling has a great importance for improving the accuracies of positioning and understanding the ionosphere. Thus, various models have been developed to detect TEC value in the last years. Single Layer Model (SLM) which provides determining TEC value and GPS positioning in the ionosphere accurately is one of the most commonly used models. SLM assumes that all free electrons are concentrated in a shell of infinitesimal thickness.\nIn this paper SLM model was used to derive TEC values by means of Bernese 5.0 program developed by the University of Bern, Sweden. In this study, we have used regional ionosphere model to derive TEC value. First of all, GPS data have been collected from 10 stations in Turkey and 13 IGS stations for 7 days from 06.03.2010 to 12.03.2010. Then, Regional Ionosphere Model (RIM) is created with the reference of the GPS data. At the end of the process, the result files are stored as IONEX format. TEC results for those days are obtained with two hours interval. TEC variation related to the research area ranges from nearly 6 TECU to approximately 20 TECU. The obtained results show that TEC values start increasing until mid-days and reach peak value at 12:00 UT. After 12:00 UT it begins decreasing gradually towards night because of recombination of the ions. As a result, SLM is an effective model for mapping TEC values and determination of TEC variation can be used to identify many studies such as precursor of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and launching site determination etc.",

            "abstract": "It has become widely acknowledged that the Cretaceous – Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary mass extinction (~66Ma) is related to the environmental consequences of an impact of a large extraterrestrial body. This impact likely invoked exceptionally rapid and profound global climate change, which occurred superimposed on ongoing, long-term environmental changes. The interplay between impact-related and long-term environmental changes is still poorly documented. In a recent study, we showed that a TEX86 based Sea Surface Temperature (SST) K-Pg record from Brazos River (USA) indeed shows evidence for rapid short-term cooling following the K-Pg impact. This confirmed for the first time the hypothesis of a so-called ‘impact winter’ invoked by dust and aerosols produced by the impact, blocking incoming solar radiation.\nThis short-lived cold phase has so far not been confirmed by other studies. To verify the record from Brazos River and to reveal ongoing, long-term climate change, we performed a high resolution marine palynological and organic geochemical study on four stratigraphically expanded cores from the New Jersey Shelf, eastern USA, spanning the K-Pg boundary, using the TEX86 sea surface temperature (SST) proxy. Indeed, our new composite record confirms the brief cooler episode immediately following the K-Pg impact. Here we present these impact-related sea surface temperature changes in the context of the long term climate changes across the K-Pg boundary interval.",

            "abstract": "The tidal forcing of ice streams at their ocean boundary can serve as a natural experiment to gain an insight into their dynamics and constrain the basal sliding law. A 3-D visco-elastic full Stokes model of coupled ice-stream ice-shelf flow is used to investigate the response of ice streams to the ocean tide. In agreement with previous results based on flow-line modeling and with a fixed grounding line position, we find that a non-linear basal sliding law alone can qualitatively reproduce long period modulation of tidal forcing found in field observations. Matching the large amplitude of these modulations with the inclusion of lateral drag however requires the addition of either grounding line migration or tidally modulated changes in till strength due to sub-glacial pressure variations. Further analysis of modeled ice stream flow shows a varying stress-coupling length scale of boundary effects upstream of the grounding line. We derive a visco-elastic stress coupling length scale from ice stream equations that depends on the forcing period and closely agrees with model output. To date, the modeling of an ice stream’s response to tidal forcing appears to be the only approach capable of giving quantitative information about the basal sliding law from in-situ observations.",

            "abstract": "Cloud droplet effective radius (re) and optical thickness (τc) of liquid water cloud retrieved from multi-spectral measurement of satellite-borne sensors such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are important parameters for understanding of cloud microphysics and droplet growth process. Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) is scheduling to launch a new earth observation satellite, the Global Change Observation Mission - Climate (GCOM-C), in Japan fiscal year 2016. The GCOC-C consists the Second Generation Global Imager (SGLI) instrument, which is a radiometer providing near-ultraviolet-to-thermal-infrared multi-spectral measurements at 250m-1km resolution with 1150-1400km swath. Motivated by the importance of re and τc retrievals, the GCOM-C/SGLI cloud product also provides them. However, it is pointed out by previous studies that multi-spectral-retrieved re and τc are impacted by cloud vertical and horizontal inhomogeneity. This study investigates the impacts by using A-Train and Landsat-8 data. First, we interpret three re retrievals from 1.6, 2.1, and 3.7µm-band measurements (re,1.6, re,2.1, and re,3.7) in terms of cloud vertical inhomogeneity by using synergistic measurements from the CloudSat/CPR and Aqua/MODIS. For this interpretation, we use an approach called Contoured Frequency by Optical Depth Diagram (CFODD), which is a joint frequency diagram of CloudSat/CPR radar reflectivity profile as a function of in-cloud optical depth profile as classified according to retrieved re (Nakajima et al., 2010; Suzuki et al., 2010). The CFODD approach visualizes the linkage of re,1.6, re,2.1, and re,3.7 to cloud droplet vertical profile. Second, we simulate the biases in re and τc retrievals at 1km resolution from the MODIS and SGLI induced by cloud horizontal inhomogeneity by using high-spatial resolution measurements of Landsat-8. And then we suggest two inversion models which estimate the biases in re and τc retrievals by using co-variance matrices of multi-spectral radiances: one model explains the bias due to clear-region-contamination based on a classical mixed pixel model which is parameterized by cloud fraction. The other explains the bias due to horizontal inhomogeneity of re and τc at subpixel scale in no clear-region-contamination case.",

The element ratios (Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca) in marine carbonates have been used as proxies for reconstruction of the past environment. Recently several studies suggested that the study for the isotopic fractionation of the alkaline earth metals in marine carbonates has a potentially significant influence in geochemical research fields (e.g. Eisenhauer et al., 2009).\nThe aim of this study is to explore the influence of carbonate polymorphs (Calcite and Aragonite) and environmental factors (e.g., temperature, precipitation rate) on the level of isotopic fractionation of the alkaline earth metals. We also examined possible correlations between the level of isotopic fractionation of Ca and that of other alkaline earth metals during carbonate precipitation.\nIn order to determine the isotope fractionation factor of Mg, Ca and Sr during carbonate precipitation, calcite and aragonite were synthesized from calcium bicarbonate solution in which the amount of magnesium was controlled based on Kitano method. Calcium carbonates were also prepared from the mixture of calcium chlorite and sodium hydrogen carbonate solutions. The isotope fractionation factors were measured by MC-ICPMS.\nResults suggested that the level of isotopic fractionation of Mg during carbonate precipitation was correlated with that of Sr and that the change of the carbonate crystal structure could make differences of isotopic fractionations of Mg and Ca, however no difference was found in the case of Sr. In this presentation, the possible mechanism will be discussed.",

Because the pressure reduced in the process of upwelling, the hot spring from the reservoir will scaling CaCO3 immediately by large CO2 escape. This result will cause the space of pipeline reduced. On the other hand, as the temperature decreases, the SiO2 scaled in the part of heat exchanger. This study chose the Hongchailin and Qingshui IC-21 well as objects to simulate, and the Szeleng sandstone and the Lushan slate are the target layer of drilling well, respectively. We use pure water and saturated water pressure in our experiments. Besides, the previous studies showed that temperature of reservoir in Qingshui site was not over 300℃, so we set 300℃ as the upper limit temperature. The pressure was less than 800 bar by calculated the rock density of target layer. The original rock sample were placed in first autoclave, and added pure water in the second autoclave. Then we heat the first autoclave to reach the target temperature, and make the pressure saturated over water vapor pressure. After 72 hours the saturated water were leaked into the second autoclave. As the temperature cooling down, we removed the water from second autoclave and diluted the water. Finally, the Na+, K+, Mg+2, Ca+2 ions were analyzed by ICP. We want to get the maximum solubility of calcite and amorphous silica in equilibrium with sandstone and slate, and then check whether the method of geothermometer calculated is reasonable or not by calculated the concentration of Na+, K+, Si+4 in hot spring.",

            "abstract": "Typical studies on natural resources from a social science perspective tend to choose one type of resource—water, for example— and ask what factors contribute to the sustainable use or wasteful exploitation of that resource. However, climate change and economic development, which are causing increased pressure on local resources and presenting communities with increased levels of tradeoffs and potential conflicts, force us to consider the trade-offs between options for using a particular resource. Therefore, the transdisciplinary approach that accurately captures the advantages and disadvantages of various possible resource uses is particularly important in the complex social-ecological systems, where concerns about inequality with respect to resource use and access have become unavoidable. Needless to say, resource management and policy require sound scientific understanding of the complex interconnections between nature and society, however, in contrast to typical international discussions, I discuss Japan not as an “advanced” case where various dilemmas have been successfully addressed by the government through the optimal use of technology, but rather as a nation seeing an emerging trend that is based on a awareness of the connections between local resources and the environment. Furthermore, from a historical viewpoint, the nexus of local resources is not a brand-new idea in the experience of environmental governance in Japan. There exist the local environment movements, which emphasized the interconnection of local resources and succeeded in urging the governmental action and policymaking. For this reason, local movements and local knowledge for the resource governance warrant attention. This study focuses on the historical cases relevant to water resource management including groundwater, and considers the contexts and conditions to holistically address local resource problems, paying particular attention to interactions between science and society. I will argue the research design to enhance the holistic view of local stakeholders on local resources as the key to effective transdisciplinary approach through the on-going research project focusing on the water-energy-food nexus.",

            "abstract": "We studied the development of shallow faults in the Jandaíra Formation, a Turonian-Campanian carbonate platform in the Potiguar Basin, northeastern Brazil. Our main goal was to characterize fault geometry and properties such as porosity and permeability, and associate these results with fluid flow in shallow conditions. We used an integrated multidisciplinary approach, which combined Quickbird satellite and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV, drone) imagery, structural and sedimentary-facies mapping, and petrographic and petrophysical analyses. The Jandaíra Formation presents a variety of carbonate facies, which include mudstones to bioclastic, peloidal, intraclastic, and oolitic grainstones. We modeled our remote sensing and structural data using a finite element analysis system for 2D deformation modeling. We applied the magnitudes and directions of the present-day stress field to simulate depths as deep as 500 m. These stress data were derived from borehole breakout data and drilling-induced tensile fractures observed in resistivity image logs. Our results indicate the occurrence of dilation processes along three sets of joints that were reactivated as faults in the upper crust: N-S, NE-, and E-W-striking faults. These faults provided preferential leaching pathways to fresh water percolation, contributing to localized dissolution and increased secondary porosity and permeability. The results also indicate that the tectonic stresses are concentrated in preferred structural zones such as fault intersection and termination, which are sites of increased fracturing and dissolution. Dissolution by fluids increased permeability in carbonate rocks from primary values of 0.0–0.94 mD to as much as 1370.11 mD. This process is mostly Cenozoic.",

            "abstract": "In a series of simulation studies we have reported that vortices formed at Saturn's dawn magnetopause in simulations when IMF was northward. We interpreted these vortices as resulting from the Kelvin Helmholtz (K-H) instability. Thanks to recent advances in computer performance, we have been able to perform high resolution global MHD simulations of the Kronian magnetosphere with 0.1 Rs grid spacing. In these simulations we obtained the signature of the field-aligned currents from the K-H vortices in Saturn's auroral ionosphere and found small patchy regions of upward field-aligned current which may be related to auroral emissions. These patchy aurorae resembling our results have been reported from Cassini observations.\nIn our previous simulations we have used the constant and simple solar wind conditions to understand the basic behavior of Kronian magnetosphere. In this study we have used Cassini observations of the solar wind upstream of Saturn to drive a massively parallel simulation. Using these solar wind data we simulated the Kronian magnetosphere from 2008-02-12/14:00:31 to 2008-02-13/01:59:31 when the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observed Kronian UV auroral emissions. For these solar wind conditions there are several enhancements of the solar wind dynamic pressure (shocks) and a polarity reversal in the IMF components.\nFrom these simulations we obtained the dynamically changing shape and convection pattern of the Kronian magnetosphere in response to the variation of solar wind dynamic pressure and IMF direction. In particular, a layered convection pattern formed between the corotation region and magnetopause. The layers in this convection system interacted with each other, forming large vortices. We calculated the configuration of field aligned currents from the simulation and found layered and patchy distributions in the ionosphere. The pattern of these upward field aligned currents in the dawn side ionosphere resembles the configuration of auroral emission observed by HST well.",

One key parameter for the description of groundwater flow and transport is hydraulic conductivity (K). In every day practice, K is often estimated based on literature values or ex-situ laboratory measurements. The calculation of K based on grain size distribution data is a very prominent example of a well-established but unsuitable method for the characterization of heterogeneous sedimentary deposits. Even though concerns about the suitability of this method for detailed aquifer characterization have been raised in several publications, this approach is still widely used by both, scientists and practitioners – mainly due to its simplicity. Hence, a vast number of different empirical and semi-empirical formulas already exist and even more adapted formulas are proposed, although reliable alternatives are available. With this contribution we want to raise awareness about the intrinsic limitations of using grain size data for the determination of K and show direct push-based alternatives for reliable and efficient high resolution aquifer characterization.",

It has been found that CB are heavily concentrated in the eastern hemisphere, while MORB, OIB and AB are broadly distributed in the eastern and western hemispheres evenly. Using the multivariate analysis “Independent Component Analysis (ICA)”, three independent components (ICs) are identified, as have been deduced in the previous studies on the oceanic and arc basalts, which account for 99 % of the sample variance. Of these, the two independent components (IC1 and IC2) span a compositional plane that concentrates most of the data (95%). Therefore, the young basalts from almost all tectonic settings on Earth mostly plot on a single compositional plane. The geochemical nature and the statistical properties (mean, standard deviation and skewness) of the ICs suggest that IC1 is related to variability of a long-term ‘melt component’ inherited in the mantle, whereas IC2 corresponds to a long-term ‘aqueous fluid component’ in the mantle, likely produced by melting and aqueous fluid-rock interactions at ridge, plume and subduction zone. Material recycling and multiple processing in these tectonic settings allows IC1 and IC2 to overlap and create the major compositional plane. On the other hand, the third component (IC3) accounts for 4% of the sample variance and exhibits unique features (e.g., a large positive skewness), suggesting that it represents minor and incomplete mixing of continental components from outside the mantle recycling system. In addition, IC2 shows global geographical discrimination, irrespective of the type of basalts, indicating presence of east-west geochemical hemispheres in the mantle. We have also found a striking geometrical similarity between the IC2 hemispheres and the inner core hemispheric structure: the eastern hemisphere shows positive IC2 in the mantle and high seismic velocities in the inner core. Combining these constraints, we propose top-down hemispherical dynamics involving both the mantle and the core.",

These models are based on different physics-based numerical models of the near-Earth space environment and employ different data assimilation techniques. All models are capable of assimilating a variety of ground- and space-based global observations. For this presentation, MEPS has been used to study the March 2013 geomagnetic storm, which was driven by a coronal mass ejection. The results of this study with an emphasis on two of the MEPS models will be presented. The two models are the Global Assimilation on Ionospheric Measurements Gauss-Markov (GAIM-GM) and Full Physics (GAIM-FP) models. The GAIM-GM model is a simpler model that uses the physics-based Ionosphere Forecast Model (IFM) as a background model but uses a statistical process in the Kalman filter. The GAIM-FP model is a more sophisticated model that uses a physics-based ionosphere-plasmasphere model (IPM) and an Ensemble Kalman filter technique. The similarities and differences of these models to specify the ionosphere before and during the storm will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) arisen from phosphoric acid digestion of carbonates has been noticed since the beginning of stable isotope geochemistry. However, the molecular level details of this reaction have not been fully understood yet. Equilibrium 13C-18O clumped isotope distribution in carbonates has been suggested as a new thermometer for surface temperature systems; nevertheless, existing Δ47-T relationships calibrated by several different groups are incompatible, generating substantial confusions and debates about those variations. Here we propose a new molecular-level mechanism with three parallel pathways for the phosphoric acid digestion of carbonates. We show that the KIE of such reaction can be different if the relative contributions of the three parallel pathways are changed. This new mechanism abandons completely a previously proposed molecular mechanism (i.e., Guo et al., 2009) and can explain (at least partly) why the Δ47-T relationships provided by different groups are different. Together with a re-calculated equilibrium clumped isotope fractionation factors of carbonate minerals using a new volume-variable-cluster-model method with higher theoretical-level treatments and higher-order anharmonic corrections, we present a theoretical (equilibrium + KIE) Δ47-T relationship for carbonates. Our theoretical calibration line is with large variations due to considering possible changes of relative contributions of the three parallel pathways and different carbonate mineral used. For minimizing the variation, we suggest using the same amount of sample, the same mineral and the same temperature of phosphoric acid digestion for this experiment.",

            "abstract": "Natural hazards can trigger major industrial accidents, which apart from affecting industrial installations may cause a series of accidents with serious impacts on human health and the environment far beyond the site boundary. Such accidents, also called Na-Tech (natural – technical) accidents, deserve particular attention since they can cause release of hazardous substances possibly resulting in severe environmental pollution, explosions and/or fires. There are different kinds of natural events or, in general terms, of natural causes of industrial accidents, such as landslides, hurricanes, high winds, tsunamis, lightning, cold/hot temperature, floods, heavy rains etc that have caused accidents. The scope of this paper is to examine the coastal flooding as a parameter in causing an industrial accident, such as the nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan, and the critical role of this parameter in industrial site selection.\nLand use planning is a complex procedure that requires multi-criteria decision analysis involving economic, environmental and social parameters. In this context the parameter of a natural hazard occurrence, such as coastal flooding, for industrial site selection should be set by the decision makers. In this paper it is evaluated the influence that has in the outcome of a multi-criteria decision analysis for industrial spatial planning the parameter of an accident risk triggered by coastal flooding. The latter is analyzed in the context of both sea-and-inland induced flooding.",

However, Hg ocean cycling is not yet completely understood, partly because many regions remain undersampled. During UK-GEOTRACES sampling campaign GA10 water has been collected along the 40° parallel in the South Atlantic Ocean.\nTotal mercury (THg), monomethylmercury (MeHg), dissolved gaseous mercury (DGM) concentrations were determined at very high vertical frequency of 20-24 depths per station. THg was uniformly distributed throughout the water column with an average of 1.6 ± 0.99 pM. Surface waters were depleted in comparison to deep and intermediate waters, where concentrations increased slightly westwards from Mid-Atlantic Ridge.\nAn increase of MeHg (up to 0.15 pM) in surface waters from 0°W to 20°W was observed, co-occurring with increased Chlorophyll a abundance. MeHg was locally increased also at depths corresponding to North Atlantic Deep Water, which may be carrying anthropogenic signal of intensive Hg use on northern hemisphere.\nDGM was strongly depleted in surface waters, indicating they are source of Hg0 to the atmosphere. Concentrations ranged from 0.01 pM to 0.55 pM and represented between 0.9% and 56% of THg. Highest concentrations were found in Antarctic Intermediate Water and Antarctic Bottom Water.

            "abstract": "This paper presents a 3D inversion result of the magnetotelluric soundings over the caldera regions in the central part of NE Japan arc. The 181 MT stations in total were located around the Naruko volcano with ~3km grid covering the area of 40km (EW) x 80km (NS). We have used the full tensor components of impedance tensors at representative eight periods (0.4~1300s). The inversion code of WSINV3DMT was used. The initial model had a uniform earth of 100 ohmm with surrounding oceans (0.25 ohmm). The final model gave rms of 2.5 with error floor of 10%. Significant features of the model are the thick resistive upper crust in the caldera regions and sub-vertical conductors arising from the lower crust to the geothermal manifestations. The top of such sub-vertical conductor coincides with the cutoff depth of the shallow seismicity. In particular, the sub-vertical conductor at Naruko volcano has a deep root in the mid-to-lower crust underneath the Mukaimachi Caldera, which is located 20km west of the Naruko volcano. The supply of the high salinity fluid may be originated sideways and may imply the path of the fluids, which is presumably blocked by the impermeable consolidated volcanic rocks directly above the lower crustal conductor. The resistivity of the mid-to-lower crustal conductors is significantly low at the Naruko volcano, compared with those at Sanzugawa caldera to the north. The difference may be due to the salinity as well as the porosity of the fluid, because seismic tomography result does not show such differences. A helium isotope anomaly at Naruko volcano may support that the flux from the upper mantle is large.",

            "abstract": "The responses of the terrestrial carbon cycle to its natural and anthropogenic driving factors are considered to be altered substantially by nitrogen dynamics. In this study, we use a land surface model coupling the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles to quantify the effect of nitrogen cycle on the sensitivity of terrestrial carbon cycle to atmosphere CO2 and concurrent climatic change. The model is Common Land Model (CoLM) updated by adopting the plant and soil C and N scheme from the Dynamic Nitrogen Scheme (DyN). We forced the model with reconstructed historical climate fields of CRUNCEP data and observed rising atmospheric CO2 concentration from 1900 to 2012. The simulated sensitivity of carbon fluxes by our carbon only (CoLM-C) and carbon nitrogen cycles model (CoLM-CN) to climate variability and atmospheric CO2 trends are compared with other independent studies. Global-scale results of CoLM-CN show that the model produces realistic estimates of current period C and N stocks, despite some regional biases. In response to rising atmospheric CO2 concentration, the simulated Gross Primary Production (GPP) and Net Primary Production (NPP) increases are suppressed by N limitations by 30% and 20%, respectively. The relative response of NPP to CO2 (12% per 100 ppm) when N is accounted for compares well with the sensitivity derived from Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiments (13% per 100 ppm). For the last 30 years, N limitation decreases the Net Biosphere Production (NBP) sensitivity to atmosphere CO2 by 16%. In response to the climatic changes, our results show that the interannual variability of C fluxes (GPP, NPP, NBP) is more closed controlled by precipitation in tropical and temperate ecosystems, while temperature is more important in boreal ecosystems. Including N cycle did not change the phase but reduce the magnitude of interannual variability of these fluxes. Globally, the model simulated a positive correlation between NBP and precipitation (2.2±1.5 Pg C per 100 ppm of interannual precipitation change by CoLM-C, and 1.6±1.2 PgC per 100 ppm of interannual precipitation change by CoLM-CN). Our results highlight the importance of including N cycle to reduce the uncertainties of climate sensitivity of carbon fluxes and understand the responses of terrestrial carbon cycle to climate system.",

            "abstract": "On September 21, 2013, a Mw4.8 earthquake occurred at more than 70 km deep in the Wind River Range (western Wyoming). Moment tensor inversions show dominant strike-slip faulting with a small reverse component, with nodal planes striking nearly ENE and NW. While intermediate-depth earthquakes are common in a subduction context, there have been very few upper-mantle intraplate events. The 2012 Mw8.6 off-shore Sumatra event is an example of a « deep » intraplate strike-slip earthquake which occurred in the low ocean crust or mantle. The Wyoming event is thus a very unique example of deep intracontinental earthquake. The physical mechanism responsible of intermediate-depth earthquakes remains under debate. This work aims at determining robust source parameters to investigate any distinct characteristic from that for shallow earthquakes or subduction zone intermediate-depth events.\nWe adopt the empirical Green’s function (EGF) approach to empirically correct for path and site effects. The nearby Ml3.0 aftershock which occurred 2 hours after the mainshock and at similar depth, is considered as EGF earthquake. This only aftershock is located at ~5 km from the mainshock and turns out to be a good EGF since both earthquakes generate high-correlated waveforms. Using the multitaper approach we are able to deconvolve the EGF from the mainshock with robust spectral and temporal representations. We use both the spectral (spectral ratio) and the temporal (source time function) information to obtain a more robust estimate of the source duration and the corresponding corner frequency, but require an adaptive window in order to have good signal to noise ratios in as wide a frequency band as possible. We propose a semi-automatic, adaptive time window approach, that allows for a robust measurement at each single station, thereby enhancing the analysis of the azimuthal distribution of corner frequencies.\nWe additionally investigate the radiated seismic energy of the Mw4.8 earthquake, in order to test whether the seismic efficiency provides additional constraints to explain any differences with respect to crustal earthquakes or other intermediate-depth earthquakes.",

As the photospheric boundary to that model we employ data from several instruments, namely the Wilcox Solar Observatory, NSO's Kitt Peak Vacuum Telescope, the Michelson Doppler Imager onboard the SOHO spacecraft and its successor, the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager onboard SDO. Instead of the harmonic function approach commonly used, we employ a three dimensional computational grid and methods of computational fluid dynamics to solve the governing equations in order to easily incorporate more complex phenomena if the need for doing so arises during the course of our work. Another advantage of the grid approach is the possibility to outsource the computational work to a parallel computing architecture like NVIDIA's CUDA, which we employ to speed up processing time and increase data throughput significantly. The obtained magnetic field data is utilized in several ways. First it is compared with in-situ data from several spacecraft like Ulysses to validate the employed PFSS model. We further use the expansion geometry of the magnetic field as an input to a 1D-solar-wind model developed by Cranmer et al. (2007) to determine characteristics of the solar wind in several magnetic flux tubes. We can then infer the theoretical charge-state composition inside these flux tubes, which in turn can be employed to test our hypotheses on the origin of the slow solar wind.",

The vast majority of systems importantly include desktop-based clients with a graphical user interface (GUI) for the operators in early warning centers. However, in times of cloud computing and ubiquitous computing the use of concepts and paradigms, introduced by continuously evolving approaches in information and communications technology (ICT), have to be considered even for early warning systems (EWS).\nBased on the experiences and the knowledge gained in three research projects – 'German Indonesian Tsunami Early Warning System' (GITEWS), 'Distant Early Warning System' (DEWS), and 'Collaborative, Complex, and Critical Decision-Support in Evolving Crises' (TRIDEC) – new technologies are exploited to implement a cloud-based and web-based prototype to open up new prospects for EWS. This prototype, named 'TRIDEC Cloud', merges several complementary external and in-house cloud-based services into one platform for automated background computation with graphics processing units (GPU), for web-mapping of hazard specific geospatial data, and for serving relevant functionality to handle, share, and communicate threat specific information in a collaborative and distributed environment.\nThe prototype in its current version addresses tsunami early warning and mitigation. The integration of GPU accelerated tsunami simulation computations have been an integral part of this prototype to foster early warning with on-demand tsunami predictions based on actual source parameters. However, the platform is meant for researchers around the world to make use of the cloud-based GPU computation to analyze other types of geohazards and natural hazards and react upon the computed situation picture with a web-based GUI in a web browser at remote sites. The current website is an early alpha version for demonstration purposes to give the concept a whirl and to shape science’s future.

            "abstract": "The development of quantitative models that describe physical processes from the Solar corona to the Earth’s upper atmosphere opens the possibility of numerical space weather forecasting with a lead time of a few days. We will describe our work with community models to develop ionospheric forecasts starting with the solar wind driver. Our current focus is the daytime ionospheric response to high-speed solar wind streams that are prevalent during the declining phase of the solar cycle. A number of challenges are addressed, including high latitude energy deposition and its impact on global thermospheric circulation patterns and composition. The degree to which forecasts are successful depends on the manner in which Alfvenic solar wind variability drives the ionospheric response. Large-scale and small-scale magnetospheric processes are important to consider, including the role of particle precipitation in depositing energy into the thermosphere and in changing ionospheric conductivities through increased ionization. Accurate forecasts require that we address the following question: what are the impacts of (less predictable) small-scale processes in determining the large-scale daytime ionospheric response, versus the role of larger scale magnetospheric processes that may be easier to predict? We will compare model-based forecasts with a variety of satellite and ground-based data sources to assess the fidelity of physical processes represented in the models. Outstanding science questions that are relevant to forecasts are described.",

            "abstract": "With seed funds from the Sloan Foundation, the International Continental Drilling Program (ICDP) approved a proposal by 39 international proponents for scientific drilling in the Oman ophiolite. Via observations on core, geophysical logging, fluid sampling, hydrological measurements, and microbiological sampling in a series of boreholes, we will address long-standing, unresolved questions regarding melt and solid transport in the mantle beneath oceanic spreading ridges, igneous accretion of oceanic crust, mass transfer between the oceans and the crust via hydrothermal alteration, and recycling of volatile components in subduction zones. We will undertake frontier exploration of subsurface weathering processes in mantle peridotite, including natural mechanisms of carbon dioxide uptake from surface waters and the atmosphere, and the nature of the subsurface biosphere.\nSocietally relevant aspects include involvement and training of university students, including numerous students from Sultan Qaboos University in Oman. Studies of natural mineral carbonation will contribute to design of engineered systems for geological carbon dioxide capture and storage. Studies of alteration will contribute to fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of reaction-driven cracking, which could enhance geothermal power generation and extraction of unconventional hydrocarbon resources.\nWe hope to begin drilling in late 2015. Meanwhile, we are seeking an additional $2M to match the combined Sloan and ICDP funding from national and international funding agencies. Matching funds are needed for operational costs of drilling, geophysical logging, downhole fluid sampling, and core description. Information on becoming part of the named investigator pool is in Appendix 14 (page 70) of the ICDP proposal, available at https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/gpg/projects/icdp-workshop-oman-drilling-project. This formal process should begin at about the time of the 2014 Fall AGU Meeting.

Using Cluster data, from the WHISPER and CIS instruments for the interval spanning 2000-2012, the field-aligned variations in the electron density and average ion mass are examined. The combination of the resulting models are used to infer an empirical model for the plasma mass density along closed geomagnetic field lines in the outer plasmasphere and plasmatrough (5.9 ≤ L < 9.5), including dependences with L shell and MLT (Magnetic Local Time). The findings indicate some key features concerning the variations in number density and ion composition in this region. This includes a previously unconsidered localised peak in electron density at the magnetic equator, at least within the plasmatrough.\nThe study is extended further by examining variations in the data with geomagnetic activity, and including these dependences in the electron density and average ion mass models. The resulting model for the inferred plasma mass density spatial distribution provides information on the mass loading processes in this region during different levels of geomagnetic activity. In addition, the mass density model is utilised to investigate corresponding variations in the properties of magnetospheric ULF (Ultra Low Frequency) pulsations, demonstrating a possible application of the model.",

            "abstract": "Great advances have been made in recent years to better understand and model the processes that occur in Plinian plumes. However, comparatively little work has been conducted on modeling coignimbrite plumes, which form as fine-grained material is lofted from the top of pyroclastic density currents, rising into the atmosphere due to buoyancy. This fundamental difference in source condition (gas thrust vs. buoyancy) means that the parameters used to describe Plinian plumes, for example initial source radius, upwards velocity, temperature, gas mass fraction and grain-size distribution are not appropriate for modeling coignimbrite events.\nIn this study, the ash flow model of Bursik and Woods (1996) is coupled with a plume model (Bursik 2001, Barsotti et al. 2008) to investigate the controls on coignimbrite plume formation, and once formed, the height and dynamics of the plume. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using DAKOTA software and results show that source temperature and gas mass fraction play a key role in controlling when ‘lift-off’ occurs. Once formed, maximum plume height is controlled by the source radius, the temperature at ‘liftoff’ and the entrainment assumption.\nFinally, we use the May 18th 1980 Mount St. Helens co-blast eruption to test the application of an ash dispersion model, specifically VOLCALPUFF (Barsotti et al., 2008), to the coignimbrite problem, with the specific aim of distinguishing differences in application for coignimbrite and Plinian events. The results highlight the importance of coignimbrite events when considering ash fall hazard and a requirement to treat such events separately to Plinian events.\nAndrews, B.J. and Manga, M..

            "abstract": "Multispectral land surface classification methods are widely used for mapping glacier outlines. Significant post-classification manual editing is typically required, and mapping glacier outlines over larger regions remains a rather labour intensive task. In this contribution we introduce a novel method for mapping glacier outlines from multispectral satellite imagery, requiring only minor manual editing.\nOver the last decade GLIMS (Global Land Ice Measurements from Space) improved the availability of glacier outlines, and in 2012 the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI) attained global coverage by compiling existing and new data sources in the wake of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR5). With the launch of Landsat 8 in 2013 and the upcoming ESA (European Space Agency) Sentinel 2 missions, the availability of multispectral imagery may grow faster than our ability to process it into timely and reliable glacier outline products. Improved automatic classification methods would enable a full exploitation of these new data sources.\nWe outline the theoretical basis of the proposed classification algorithm, provide a step by step walk-through from raw imagery to finished ice cover grids and vector glacier outlines, and evaluate the performance of the new method in mapping the outlines of glaciers, ice caps and the Greenland Ice Sheet from Landsat 8 OLI imagery. The classification output is compared against manually digitized ice margin positions, the RGI vectors, and the PROMICE (Programme for Monitoring of the Greenland Ice Sheet) aerophotogrammetric map of Greenland ice masses over a sector of the Disko Island surge cluster in West Greenland, the Qassimiut ice sheet lobe in South Greenland, and the A.P.

The regional imprints of rapid climate shifts, their timing and hence connection to local vs. large-scale mechanisms are however still poorly understood owing to a limited number of records with usually large age uncertainties and low sampling rates.\nIn this study we examine the spatiotemporal evolution of rapid climate shifts over central Europe and Scandinavia during Bølling-Allerød (14.7-12.7kyr BP) and Younger Dryas (~12kyr BP) by means of pollen data and climate simulations. For a better understanding of physical mechanisms behind regional imprints of climate shifts, time slice experiments with the Community Earth System Model (CCSM1.0.5) are set up at high resolution (1°x1°) using different topographies and ice sheets (ICE-5G and a new version of GLAC). Matching these time slice experiments with the spatial temperature pattern derived from pollen records, we estimate the extent to which environmental conditions (pollen) represent the direct large-scale influence of climate over the Euro-Atlantic sector vs. regional-scale climate effects e.g. caused by shrinking ice sheets and coastal transgression due to sea-level rise.",

These instruments have a resolution of 10-9 rad and a stability better than 10-8rad/month (Boudin & al., 2008, 2013). We present here the associated records and their interpretation in terms of a possible succession of moderate slow slip events before the mainshock. The instrument was installed in July 2012 in order to detect low amplitude strain transients in the northern chile subduction gap, as part of the IPOC project. Removal of earth tide and correlation with temperature and atmospheric pressure were investigated to reduce the noise level. After a first 10 months recording phase, interruptured by temporary mining works, the recording restarted mid-December 2013. After stabilization, the westward tilt rate took a stable value, about 7.10-7 rad/yr, corresponding to the interseismic loading After the 5-7 january earthquake sequence, it jumped to a higher, stable value (phase A) until early February. The 2-4 February, the tilt rate changed to a smaller value, and stayed stable (phase B) until the 16 of March, M=6.8 major foreshock. The latter, with the following foreshocks, produced large tilt steps, but the tilt rate between these events kept stable (phase C), close to that of phase A. Finally, the north component shows a fast tilt rate change starting the 5 of March. The coincidence betwen the start of seismic swarms and the change in tilt rate lead us to associate the latter to the activation of moderate slow slip events. Incidentally, we also show that the large slow slip source concentrated in the epicentral area proposed by Ruiz et al. (2014) from their GPS analysis is not supported by our tilt records.",

Atmospheric methane has contributed about 20% of the climate forcing by long-lived greenhouse gases since pre-industrial times but also influences the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere. With a lifetime of 9-10 years in the atmosphere, methane is an important target for climate change mitigation. Observations of atmospheric methane began in 1978, reached global coverage after 1983, and now include a large variety of in-situ and remote-sensed observations. After the loss of SCIAMACHY (2002-2012), two space missions are currently producing methane weighted-columns, GOSAT (since 2009) and METOP-IASI (since 2007).\nAlthough sources and sinks of methane are identified, large uncertainties remain in their spatio-temporal quantification. Here, we present a synthesis of methane emissions and sinks since 2000 using an integrated approach to combine: atmospheric measurements, chemistry-transport models, ecosystem models, emission inventories, and climate-chemistry models. The results of an ensemble of atmospheric inversions (top-down) and of process-based models (bottom-up) are presented and compared in order to propose scenarios for the increase of atmospheric methane since 2007, after almost a decade of stagnation. Global and regional methane budgets and their changes are presented and discussed for the period 2000-2012.

            "abstract": "The winter of 2013/2014 brought severe cold events over the northern North America. Here, we analyze the air-sea interaction over the Arctic and subarctic regions that is attributed to provide favorable condition for the outbreak of cold surges. In order to assess the arctic impact on the subarctic and midlatutude regions, we designed an ocean-atmosphere coupled model experiment that is forced by observational sea surface temperature (SST) over the Arctic region and climatological SST elsewhere. When the sea ice over the Chukchi and Beaufort Sea reduced below normal during summer, warm anomaly appeared over the arctic region during late fall to early winter. The atmospheric response to this arctic warming induces anticyclonic circulation, which brings SST warming over the north Pacific subarctic region. The local atmospheric response to the warm SST anomaly acts to reinforce the arctic warming by warm advection, and the ensuing atmospheric response further enhances the SST anomaly. This feedback process between the Arctic and subarctic atmosphere and ocean enables the arctic warming and the anomalous SST over the northern north Pacific to persist and develop until late winter and early spring. It is supposed that the quasi-stationary high over the northwestern North America during 2013 winter that contributed to the development of severe weather events over the adjacent regions was closely linked with the persistent SST anomaly over the northern North Pacific which was resulted from the arctic-subarctic feedback.",

            "abstract": "The recent work by Kagan and Jackson (2013) has awakened us to the possibility that there may be five M9 earthquake occurring per century for a long time. The co-seismic inertia perturbation associated to global seismicity from 1977 to 2013 (CMT earthquake catalogue) yields a total displacement of the rotation axis towards the Pacific ocean of about 35 cm, corresponding to almost 1 cm/yr. This significant result, although smaller by one order of magnitude compared to the observed True Polar Wander (TPW) velocity of 10 cm/yr, has motivated us to refine the simulations including the viscoelastic relaxation of the Planet. The viscoelastic relaxation, indeed, is responsible for the rotational instability of the Earth on geological timescales, the hydrostatic bulge being able to readjust to new positions of the rotation axis, and amplifies the earthquake-induced inertia perturbations during the transient phase. In this vein, we develop a time-dependent model of global seismicity on the million years timescale based on (i) plate reconstruction data from, here we have employed G-plates, (ii) the momentum conservation principle relating the seismic moment rate at plate boundaries to the relative velocity between plates and (iii) using the Anderson’s theory of faulting. Simulations based on this time-dependent model well agree with the result from the earthquake catalogue in the elastic limit and show that the TPW excursion may reach several degrees and that TPW velocity are only triggered by changes in global seismicity through the million year timescale. Key parameters of our simulations are (a) the viscosity of the lithosphere which controls the timescales at which each earthquake still perturbs the inertia of the planet, (b) the stabilizing rotational effect associated to the non-hydrostatic bulge from mantle density anomalies and (c) the nature of the major density discontinuities in the mantle.",

            "abstract": "The long, high-resolution and largely undisturbed depositional record of polar ice sheets is one of the greatest resources in paleoclimate research. The vertical profile of isotopic and other geochemical tracers provides a full history of depositional and dynamical variations. Numerical simulations of this archive could afford great advances both in the interpretation of these tracers as well as to help improve ice sheet models themselves, as show successful implementations in oceanography and atmospheric dynamics. However, due to the slow advection velocities, tracer modeling in ice sheets is particularly prone to numerical diffusion, thwarting efforts that employ straightforward solutions. Previous attemps to circumvent this issue follow conceptually and computationally extensive approaches that augment traditional Eulerian models of ice flow with a semi-Lagrangian tracer scheme (e.g. Clarke et al., QSR, 2005).\nHere, we propose a new vertical discretization for ice sheet models that eliminates numerical diffusion entirely. Vertical motion through the model mesh is avoided by mimicking the real-world ice flow as a thinning of underlying layers (see figure). A new layer is added to the surface at equidistant time intervals (isochronally). Therefore, each layer is uniquely identified with an age. Horizontal motion follows the shallow ice approximation using an implicit numerical scheme. Vertical diffusion of heat which is physically desirable is also solved implicitly. A simulation of a two-dimensional section through the Greenland ice sheet will be discussed.",

In Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) project, Capillary number becomes key-issue, because it is strongly related the accessibility of total pore space of the reservoir. In this study, we conducted two different types of investigations to discuss the effect of capillary number for high-permeable Mt. Simon sandstone (Φ:26.4%). First, we performed a CO2 injection experiment and measure P-wave velocity and strain during injection. The Mt. Simon sandstone has high absolute-permeability (105 mD) and single modal pore-size distribution (peak size: 23 mm). The sample was cut into column shape (d:50mm, L50mm). In this study, we set three Vp-measurement lines by each 10 mm and two strain gages (vertical and horizontal) at same height (center of core). During CO2 injection (drainage), we kept a constant flow-rate at 0.5ml/min and differential pressure under 120 kPa and injected totally 7.7 PV (200ml ) of CO2. All Vp-measurement lines indicated small reduction (< 2%), simultaneously after 7.7PV CO2 injection. It is obviously lower value. Some previous studies reported over 10 % Vp-reduction in drainage. On the other hand, both of strains data indicated the expansions over 2000με and 1400με, respectively. In generally, Vp-reduction is directly related the increasing of CO2-saturation and it consider that there are no large-change of CO2 saturations in the samples. However, strains indicate the existence of injected CO2 in pore space. Thus, we assumed that the CO2 makes a channel out of the Fresnel zones of all Vp-measurements lines. To elucidate this assumption, we discussed the CO2 flow pattern by using TOUGH-2 simulation and confirmed the strong effect of flow–rate on the CO2 flow pattern channels.",

            "abstract": "Tropical savanna covers a large fraction of the global land area and thus may have a substantial effect on the global soil-atmosphere exchange of nitrogen. The pronounced seasonality of hygric conditions in this ecosystem affects strongly microbial process rates in the soil. As these microbial processes control the uptake, production, and release of nitrogen compounds, it is thought that this seasonality finally leads to strong temporal dynamics and varying magnitudes of gaseous losses to the atmosphere. However, given their areal extent and in contrast to other ecosystems, still few in-situ or laboratory studies exist that assess the soil-atmosphere exchange of nitrogen. We present laboratory incubation results from intact soil cores obtained from a natural savanna site in Northern Australia, where N2O, NO, and N2 emissions under controlled environmental conditions were investigated. Furthermore, in-situ measurements of high temporal resolution at this site recorded with automated static and dynamic chamber systems are discussed (N2O, NO). This data is then used to assess the performance of a process-based biogeochemical model (LandscapeDNDC), and the potential magnitude and dynamics of components of the site-scale nitrogen cycle where no measurements exist (biological nitrogen fixation and nitrate leaching). Our incubation results show that severe nutrient limitation of the soil only allows for very low N2O emissions (0.12 kg N ha-1 yr-1) and even a periodic N2O uptake. Annual NO emissions were estimated at 0.68 kg N ha-1 yr-1, while the release of inert nitrogen (N2) was estimated at 6.75 kg N ha-1 yr-1 (data excl. contribution by pulse emissions). We observed only minor N2O pulse emissions after watering the soil cores and initial rain events of the dry to wet season transition in-situ, but short-lived NO pulse emissions were substantial. Interestingly, some cores exhibited a very different N2O emission potential, indicating a substantial spatial variability of potential N release. For most soil moisture and temperature settings, N2 emissions dominated the release of gaseous nitrogen loss (82-99% of total gaseous N loss).",

            "abstract": "Ostracod shells have widely been used as source material for geochemical analysis of stable isotope and trace element composition in paleolimnological reconstruction of lake hydrochemistry and climate as they provide insight into past water balance and solute evolution of lakes. During five fieldtrips to the Tibetan Plateau, taking place between 2008 and 2012, we collected live and sub-recent ostracods from 333 sites. Hydrochemical parameters, such as temperature, electrical conductivity, pH as well as major and minor ion concentrations were measured at each site and show high variability between sites. Adult intact individuals from the most common ostracod taxa were selected and their shell chemistry analyzed. The trace elemental data for the living ostracods compared to the hydrological data provides a calibration dataset for further hydrological and thus climatological reconstruction. Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios in ostracod shells provide information about past water temperature and salinity resulting from changes in precipitation vs. evaporation ratios and monsoon activity. Furthermore, Mn/Ca, Fe/Ca and U/Ca ratios are being explored as redox indicators to reconstruct oxygenation cycles.\nTo reconstruct the monsoon dynamics on the Tibetan Plateau, sediment cores from different lakes on an east-west transect were taken: two long sediment cores from lakes Nam Co and Tangra Yumco, covering the past 20,000 years, and a short core from Lake Taro Co. The lakes feature an alkaline environment but show significant differences in their electrical conductivity ranging from 0.99 mS/cm (Taro Co) and 1.8 mS/cm (Nam Co) to 12 mS/cm (Tangra Yumco). The chemical composition of valves of the most common ostracod species in these lakes, Leucocytherella sinensis, was analyzed using laser ablation ICP-MS. The reconstruction provides a more extensive insight in past precipitation – evaporation balance and lake level change and provides clues about the interaction between the different air masses (Indian Ocean Summer Monsoon, East Asian Summer Monsoon and Westerlies) and thus monsoonal dynamics.",

We performed temporal and spatial analysis to the stresses before and after the mainshock from static stress change and focal mechanism solutions. We derived a tectonic stress field model in the vicinity of the source area of the M9.0 North-eastern Japan Earthquake from modeling seismicity and analyzing earthquake focal mechanisms before and after the mainshock. The results show that the stress field in source region barely had any change before and after each large earthquake prior to the M9.0 mainshock. The stress state did not change in the places where are distant away from the rupture center of the M9.0 mainshock during its occurrence, with the azimuth of the maximum principal stress to be 290º, which is perpendicular to the strike of the Japan trench, and dip angle to be 19º. In comparison, the static stress has significant change in the central part of the source region after mainshock, with the occurrence of numerous normal fault type events. There exists an area with negative stress change in the source area of the M9.0 earthquake after the mainshock, with the P axis rotated from horizontal to vertical, which are responsible for numerous normal faulting events, where was dominated by thrust faulting prior to the mainshock. This pattern indicates a complete stress and strain release or locally stresses regime change. Our results provide a constrain to the stress accumulation- release pattern spatially and temporally for the source region of 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake. We suggested that the seismicity pattern, may provide some valuable information on the stages of stress accumulation, and thus may be used for estimation of earthquake risk.\nKEYWORDS\nSource Region, Stress Change, 2011 Tohoku Earthquake, Earthquake Prediction.",

The MDB is the country’s primary agricultural area with scarce water resources impacted by climate change and extensive zones with degrading riparian vegetation.\nWe advance our understanding of the relationship between climate-driven flooding dynamics and vegetation response at the sub-continental to local and inter to intra-annual scale based on two decades of Landsat and one decade of MODIS imagery.\nWe Landsat TM and ETM+ data to synoptically map spatially detailed dynamics of flooding with an internally consistent machine learning algorithm. We derived riparian phenology (Fig 1) from MODIS data and attributed differences in vegetation response to flooding dynamics, vegetation types and sub-basin land use.\nVegetation community response to flooding varied in space and time and with vegetation types, densities and location relative to areas frequently flooded. Phenological degradation trends were observed over riparian forests and woodlands in the middle and lower parts of the basin that are primarily farmed and were we identified flooding regimes to have changed the most to less frequent and smaller inundation extents. Conversely, herbaceous vegetation phenology followed primarily a boom and bust cycle related to less extensive flooding dynamics. This pattern was found across different areas of the basin. As expected, flooding regimes and vegetation response patterns were fine grained confirming the choice of a spatially explicit, internally consistent analysis leading the path for ongoing monitoring.\nRemote sensing-based monitoring of the response of riparian vegetation to flooding can be used to quantify spatially explicit changes in vegetation community response as the result of climate variability and change and outcomes of land and water management decisions with applicability to other areas globally such as the Nile river basin and Okavango River delta in Africa or the Mekong River Basin in Southeast Asia).",

The latter extends from southern Siberia into northern Mongolia, and contains one of the word’s larger mining regions, for instance with mining of gold, silver, copper and coal. Recognizing that changing hydro-climatic conditions in the basin may lead to changed loading pattern of anthropogenic substances to Lake Baikal and Yenisei, we aim at identifying long-term historic and projected future hydro-climatic trends in this basin and their (possible) impacts. The analyses are based on hydro-climatic observations and the output 22 Earth System Models (ESMs) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 5 (CMIP5). Observations show that warming rates of the basin were twice as high as the global average during past 70 years. Decreased intra annual variability of river discharge over this period indicates basin-scale permafrost degradation. CMIP5 ensemble projections show further future warming, implying continued permafrost thaw. Most individual models as well as the CMIP5 ensemble mean result indicate increased runoff in the future. However the spread of individual model results is large. Parallel results show that such increased runoff can considerably increase the annual riverine sediment loads and consequently the loading of contaminants that are attached to the sediments, in particular downstream of mining sites. More generally, this exemplifies how long-term hydro-climatic changes, permafrost thaw, and industrial pressures may interact in increasing the bioavailability of contaminants in downstream recipients.",

We have built up an efficient procedure which incorporates with parallel computing to accomplish the above goal. We adopted the nonlinear search algorithm (Neighborhood Algorithm, NA) to explore the parameter space and construct a source model to calculate the theoretical waveform simulation by adopting the three dimensional numerical calculation. By minimizing the misfit between synthetic and observed seismograms, through the nonlinear search algorithm, we are able to obtain more precise fault plane solutions by using the less station distribution. Combining all these methods with parallel computer clusters, it allows us to perform the waveform inversion with less time consuming. Therefore, we applied the above procedures to investigate the microearthquakes that occurred in the Chukou fault, which is the main collision front in the West Foothills, Taiwan. Our results indicate that the highly agreement between the observed and the synthetic waveforms suggest the reliability of the focal mechanism. The results are not only giving better understanding the seismogenic structure beneath the West Foothills in Taiwan , but also can allow us to identify waveform characteristics caused by the source heterogeneity or fluid effect. Due to the valve action on the fault plane may exhibit variation in fault strength, the large fluid pressure around the valve area would also take effect to the microearthquakes. Thus, the derived source parameters obtained from this study can serve as a detail physical status to investigate the seismongenic structures beneath the fault zone for future research.",

            "abstract": "Reliable climate-change projections of extreme precipitation events are of great interest to decision makers, due to potentially important hydrological impacts such as floods, land slides and debris flows. Low-resolution climate models generally project increases of heavy precipitation events with climate change, but there are large uncertainties related to the limited spatial resolution and the parameterized representation of atmospheric convection. \nHere we employ a convection-resolving version of the COSMO model across an extended region (1100 km x 1100 km) covering the European Alps to investigate the differences between parameterized and explicit convection in climate-change scenarios. We conduct 10-year long integrations at resolutions of 12 and 2km. Validation using ERA-Interim driven simulations reveals major improvements with the 2km resolution, in particular regarding the diurnal cycle of mean precipitation and the representation of hourly extremes. In addition, 2km simulations replicate the observed super-adiabatic scaling at precipitation stations, i.e. peak hourly events increase faster with temperature than the Clausius-Clapeyron scaling of 7%/K (see Ban et al. 2014).\nConvection-resolving climate change scenarios are conducted using control (1991-2000) and scenario (2081-2090) simulations driven by a CMIP5 GCM (i.e. the MPI-ESM-LR) under the IPCC RCP8.5 scenario. Comparison between 12 and 2km resolutions with parameterized and explicit convection, respectively, reveals close agreement in terms of mean summer precipitation amounts (decrease by 30%), and regarding slight increases of heavy day-long events (amounting to 15% for 90th-percentile for wet-day precipitation). However, the different resolutions yield large differences regarding extreme hourly precipitation, with the 2km version projecting substantially faster increases of heavy hourly precipitation events (about 30% increases for 90th-percentile hourly events). \n\nBan, N., J.

            "abstract": "The interaction between ocean waves and nearshore topography, such as submarine canyons that extend close to shore, can - through wave interference - introduce fast (intra-wave scale) spatial variability in the mean wave statistics (e.g., the significant wave height). These variations are associated with refraction-induced cross-correlations in the wave field and cannot be resolved with conventional statistical wave models. To capture these effects, the evolution of the complete second-order statistics is required, as shown by Smit & Janssen (2013, J Phys Oceanogr, 43, 1741-1758) who consider an integro-differential equation to transport the complete correlation matrix. Their model captures spatial cross-correlations, thus identifying standing wave patterns affecting wave-induced momentum fluxes (radiation stresses) and circulation, and thus providing an additional level of information that was not available before in statistical wave models. In this work we apply the new quasi-coherent model to study the influence of Scripps Canyon (near San Diego) on nearshore wave statistics for different offshore wave conditions. Thereto we compare model results to observations near Scripps Canyon collected during the ONR Nearshore Canyon Experiment (NCEX), in the fall of 2003 (Magne et al., J Geophys Res, 2007). The focus of this paper is on the inhomogeneous wave effects near the Canyon, which we analyze by considering the spatial cross-correlation functions as predicted by the model and observed by arrays of sensors. The cross-correlations demonstrate that during swell conditions, partially standing wave patterns emerge in the vicinity of the canyons, which has important implications for nearshore modeling of circulation and transport processes.",

            "abstract": "Exposure to extreme temperatures during the grain filling stage of winter wheat may lead to reduction in the yield. Over the last decade, there has been an increasing trend of exposure to extreme temperature conditions, particularly during crop growing season. The Indo Gangetic plain (IGP) is a particular concern since an optimal temperature for wheat production already exists in the region. This is also a major concern for global wheat production since the region accounts for about 15% of the global wheat production. Previous studies conducted in this region have found a strong impact of extreme temperatures causing an early occurrence of senescence, defined as the last developmental stage of the plant. The early occurrence of senescence period induces shortening of growing season length, which is a critical grain filling stage. However, the direct effect of extreme temperatures on the yield data has not yet been looked at, which reflects the impact of extreme temperature at different growth stages including anthesis (flowering) and the grain-filling stage. Here in this study, we explore the relationship of extreme heat conditions on the yield using fixed-effect panel data model for the districts in the IGP region. The first result indicates approximately 16% reduction in wheat yield with 1˚C rise in mean growing season temperature. There is a significant negative trend between the yield and the fourth quartile of extreme temperature (>34˚C) days. Furthermore, we establish a scope of existence of a nonlinear relationship between temperature and yield, which needs to be further examined.",

            "abstract": "The first oxidation of a deep ocean in Earth history is considered to have occurred in the Neoproterozoic, coincident with the metazoan diversification; however, the Neoproterozoic geological record has so far been limited to only continental shelves, slopes, or basins at the deepest. Here, we document Neoproterozoic pelagic deep-sea sediments in reconstructed oceanic plate stratigraphy (OPS) in accretionary complexes (ACs) in Anglesey and Lleyn, Wales, UK. The OPS mostly consists of mid-ocean ridge basalts, pelagic red-bedded cherts, hemipelagic siliceous mudstones and turbidite sandstones, in ascending order. Only at Porth Felen in Lleyn Peninsula does the OPS contain black mudstones (ca. 10 m-thick) instead of pelagic red-bedded cherts. Based on the tectonic reconstruction of these ACs, the OPS at Porth Felen has the oldest depositional age. Our new U-Pb date of detrital zircons separated from the turbidite sandstones at Porth Felen has the youngest age of 580±13 Ma. These results suggest that the black mudstones at Porth Felen were deposited no later than the early Ediacaran. We have analyzed these black mudstones by 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy, and found that about a quarter of their iron content is contained in pyrite, while the other components are paramagnetic Fe2+ or occasionally paramagnetic Fe3+ in clay minerals. The red cherts in the younger OPS contain hematite as the main iron mineral, paramagnetic Fe3+, and paramagnetic Fe2+. The occurrence of hematite in a deep-sea chert essentially indicates a primary oxidizing depositional condition, whereas pyrite is indicative of a reducing environment. The present data confirm that a reducing deep-sea existed in the early Ediacaran during the black mudstone deposition, and that an oxidizing deep-sea had been established by the late Ediacaran. In conclusion, our results provide the first direct evidence of an actual deep open-ocean in the Ediacaran to clarify the timing and extent of the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event.",

In coupled subduction zones, tensional earthquakes are occasionally observed post a megathrust rupture, as tensional stress from slab pull is temporarily transmitted to the outer-rise. In this study we analyze some of the significant outer-rise events along the Sumatra-Andaman margin post 26 December 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake, like those occurred on January 2005 (Mw=6.5), July 2005 (Mw=7.1), August 2009 (Mw=7.5 ), March 2010 (Mw=6.6) and June 2010 (Mw=7.5). We will be discussing the source parameters,kinematic rupture process, directivity and the average stress drop of these events which are derived using seismic body wave inversion. We adopted teleseismic body wave inversion methodology of Kikuchi and Kanamori (1982, 1986 and 1991). We will be discussing the stress drop patterns and a possible asperity model for this margin and compare with other major outer-rise events post Tohoku-Oki (2011) and Maule (2010) events. The stress regimes inferred from the P & T axis orientations and its temporal evolution from inter-seismic to post-seismic phase also will be discussed.",

In the paradigm of crowdsensing, the crowd becomes a distributed network of sensors that allows us to understand real life events at a quasi-real-time rate. The SoS-Social Sensing project [http://socialsensing.it/] exploits the opportunistic crowdsensing, involving users in the sensing process in a minimal way, for social media emergency management purposes in order to obtain a very fast, but still reliable, detection of emergency dimension to face. First of all we designed and implemented a decision support system for the detection and the damage assessment of earthquakes. Our system exploits the messages shared in real-time on Twitter. In the detection phase, data mining and natural language processing techniques are firstly adopted to select meaningful and comprehensive sets of tweets. Then we applied a burst detection algorithm in order to promptly identify outbreaking seismic events. Using georeferenced tweets and reported locality names, a rough epicentral determination is also possible. The results, compared to Italian INGV official reports, show that the system is able to detect, within seconds, events of a magnitude in the region of 3.5 with a precision of 75% and a recall of 81,82%. We then focused our attention on damage assessment phase. We investigated the possibility to exploit social media data to estimate earthquake intensity. We designed a set of predictive linear models and evaluated their ability to map the intensity of worldwide earthquakes. The models build on a dataset of almost 5 million tweets exploited to compute our earthquake features, and more than 7,000 globally distributed earthquakes data, acquired in a semi-automatic way from USGS, serving as ground truth. We extracted 45 distinct features falling into four categories: profile, tweet, time and linguistic. We run diagnostic tests and simulations on generated models to assess their significance and avoid overfitting. Overall results show a correlation between the messages shared in social media and intensity estimations based on online survey data (CDI).",

            "abstract": "Solute transport in porous media may be structured at various scales by geological features, from connectivity patterns of pores to fracture networks. This structure impacts solute repartition and consequently reactivity. Here we study numerically the influence of the organization of porous volumes within diffusive porosity zones on different reactions. We couple a mobile-immobile transport model where an advective zone exchanges with diffusive zones of variable structure to the geochemical modeling software PHREEQC. We focus on two kinetically-controlled reactions, a linear sorption and a nonlinear dissolution of a mineral. We show that in both cases the structure of the immobile zones has an important impact on the overall reaction rates. Through the Multi-Rate Mass Transfer (MRMT) framework, we show that this impact is very well captured by residence times-based models for the kinetic linear sorption, as it is mathematically equivalent to a modification of the initial diffusive structure; Consequently, the overall reaction rate could be easily extrapolated from a conservative tracer experiment. The MRMT models however struggle to reproduce the non-linearity and the threshold effects associated with the kinetic dissolution. A slower reaction, by allowing more time for diffusion to smooth out the concentration gradients, tends to increase their relevance.\nFigure: Left: Representation of a mobile-immobile model with a complex immobile architecture.

            "abstract": "Increasing interest in peatlands for prediction of environmental changes requires an understanding of its geographical distribution. West Siberia Plain is the biggest peatland area in Eurasia and is situated in the high latitudes experiencing enhanced rate of climate change. West Siberian taiga mires are important globally, accounting for about 12.5% of the global wetland area. A number of peatland maps of the West Siberia was developed in 1970s, but their accuracy is limited. Here we report the effort in mapping West Siberian peatlands using 30 m resolution Landsat imagery. As a first step, peatland classification scheme oriented on environmental parameter upscaling was developed. The overall workflow involves data pre-processing, training data collection, image classification on a scene-by-scene basis, regrouping of the derived classes into final peatland types and accuracy assessment. To avoid misclassification peatlands were distinguished from other landscapes using threshold method: for each scene, Green-Red Vegetation Indices was used for peatland masking and 5th channel was used for masking water bodies. Peatland image masks were made in Quantum GIS, filtered in MATLAB and then classified in Multispec (Purdue Research Foundation) using maximum likelihood algorithm of supervised classification method. Training sample selection was mostly based on spectral signatures due to limited ancillary and high-resolution image data. As an additional source of information, we applied our field knowledge resulting from more than 10 years of fieldwork in West Siberia summarized in an extensive dataset of botanical relevés, field photos, pH and electrical conductivity data from 40 test sites. After the classification procedure, discriminated spectral classes were generalized into 12 peatland types. Overall accuracy assessment was based on 439 randomly assigned test sites showing final map accuracy was 80%. Total peatland area was estimated at 73.0 Mha. Various ridge-hollow and ridge-hollow-pool bog complexes prevail here occupying 34.5 Mha. They are followed by lakes (11.1 Mha), fens (10.7 Mha), pine-dwarf-shrub sphagnum bogs (9.3 Mha) and palsa complexes (7.4 Mha).",

            "abstract": "Reactive nitrogen loading from municipal sewage discharge provides point sources of nitrate (NO3-) to rivers and streams. Through microbially-mediated denitrification, NO3- can be converted to dinitrogen (N2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) gases, which are released to the atmosphere. Preliminary observations made throughout summer 2011 near a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) outfall in the Finger Lakes region of New York indicated that NO3- concentrations downstream of the discharge pipe were lower relative to upstream concentrations. This suggested that nitrate processing was occurring more rapidly and completely than predicted by current models and that point “sources” can in some cases be point “sinks”.\nMolecular assays and stable isotope analyses were combined with laboratory microcosm experiments and water chemistry analyses to better understand the mechanism of nitrate transformation. Nitrite reductase (nirS and nirK) and nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ) genes were detected in water and sediment samples using qPCR. Denitrifcation genes were present attached to stream sediment, in pipe biofilm, and in WWTP discharge water. A comparison of δ18-O and δ15-N signatures also supported the hypothesis that stream NO3- had been processed biotically. Results from microcosm experiments indicated that the NO3- transformations occur at the sediment-water interface rather than in the water column. In some instances, quantities of denitrification genes were at higher concentrations attached to sediment downstream of the discharge pipe than upstream of the pipe suggesting that the wastewater discharge may be enriching the downstream sediment and could promote in-stream denitrification.",

            "abstract": "The Lena River in central Siberia is one of the major pathways translocating terrestrial organic matter (OMterr) from its southernmost reaches near Lake Baikal to the coastal zone of the Laptev Sea and the Arctic Ocean. Permafrost soils from its vast catchment area store huge amounts of pre-aged OM, which is expected to be remobilized due to climate warming. To characterize the composition and vegetation sources of OM discharged by the Lena River, we analyzed the lignin phenol and carbon isotopic composition (δ13C and ∆14C) in total suspended matter (TSM) from surface waters collected in spring and summer, surface sediments from the Buor Khaya Bay along with soils from the Lena Delta. A simple linear mixing model based on the lignin phenol distributions indicates OM in TSM samples from the delta and Buor Khaya Bay surface sediments contains comparable contributions from gymnosperm sources, which are primarily from the taiga forests south of the delta, and angiosperm material typical for tundra vegetation. Considering the small area covered by tundra (~12% of total catchment), the input of tundra-derived OM input is substantial and likely to increase in a warming Arctic. Radiocarbon compositions (∆14C) of bulk OM in TSM samples varied from -55 to -391‰, i.e. 14C ages of 395 to 3920 yrs BP. Using δ13C compositions to estimate the fraction of phytoplankton-derived OM and assuming that this material has a modern 14C signature, we inferred the ∆14C compositions of OMterr in TSM exported by the Lena River to range between -190 and -700‰. Such variability in the ages of OMTERR (i.e. 1640 to 9720 14C yrs BP) reflects the heterogeneous composition and residence time of OM in the Lena River catchment soils (Holocene to Pleistocene ages).\nLignin phenol and ∆14C compositions of surface sediments from the adjacent Buor Khaya Bay suggest that OMTERR deposited there is older and more degraded than materials present in river particles and catchment soils. Stronger diagenetic alteration in Lena Delta TSM and marine sediments relative to soils may reflect degradation of more labile components during permafrost thawing and transport. Despite the high natural heterogeneity in catchment soils, the lignin biomarker compositions and radiocarbon ages of OMTERR exported by the Lena River reflect catchment characteristics such as vegetation and soil type.",

            "abstract": "On April 1st, 2014 at 23:46:50 UTC, a powerful earthquake of magnitude Mw 8.1 occurred offshore the Northern Chile in the region of the North Chilean seismic gap. The epicenter of the earthquake was approximately 50 km offshore the Chilean coast, near the town of Pisagua. Two days after the main event a Mw 7.6 aftershock struck approximately the same area. In order to identify spatio-temporal changes of source parameters and stress before and after the mainshock, we analyzed in detail the local seismicity above magnitude Mw 3.0 within the time period 01/01/2013-30/04/2014 and estimated long term trends in b-values and earthquake productivity. We used data from the IPOC (Integrated Plate boundary Observatory Chile) regional seismic network, consisting of 20 “in land” broadband station deployed and managed by the GFZ-Potsdam. The recorded earthquake catalog shows an intense foreshock activity consisting of more than 1000 M3+ events in the source region. Full waveform techniques are used to derive both locations and focal mechanisms of about 435 seismic events. The location process has been performed by using a waveform stacking method (Grigoli et al 2013, 2014) with a layered velocity model based on CRUST 2.0 (see the attached figure for the location results of one of these events). Moment tensor inversion has been performed by using the KIWI tool software (Cesca et al. 2010), which is based on a two-step inversion approach. The first step consists in the inversion of the amplitude spectra to retrieve the best fitting focal planes, while the second inversion step is carried out in time domain to solve the focal mechanism polarity and to obtain the centroid location and time. Both location and moment tensor inversion resulted in agreement with the geodynamical settings of the region. Mapping the b-value reveals a spatiotemporal anomaly of low b-values characterizing the frequency-magnitude distribution of the foreshocks in the source area of the mainshock. Finally, clustering analysis of the retrieved focal mechanism and a stress tensor inversion has been performed in order to analyze the spatio-temporal evolution of the stress, before and after the mainshock. This work has been funded by the German BMBF “Geothecnologien” project MINE (BMBF03G0737A) and by Hazard and Risk Team (HART) and PBO-Chile of GFZ.",

The volatile composition\nof the OIB reservoir - assumed to preserve a higher proportion of primordial noble gases than\nthe degassed MORB reservoir – is a strong constraint for those models. However, the correct\nvalues of the neon and argon isotopic ratios in OIBs are still a subject of debate, because of\nthe contamination of the samples by air-derived noble gases.\nAlthough there is no consensus on the origin of this contamination – is it empty vesicles or\ncracks in volcanic glasses filled with seawater; air dissolution in the magma at the timing of\nmagma eruption; assimilation of oceanic crust in the magma chamber?- targeting directly\nwith a laser the vesicle to analyse in volcanic glasses is an efficient way to reduce this\ncontamination.\nHere we present analyses of individual vesicles of an Icelandic volcanic glass, DICE 11,\nthat was extensively studied in the past by crushing pieces of the volcanic glass under\nvacuum, because it was considered to have a pure plume origin. The mm-sized sample was\nimaged tomographically with a 5μm resolution. For opening bubbles, we used a 193nm\nExcimer laser to avoid diffusion of noble gases by local heating. CO2 contents were estimated\nby pressure measurement in the laser cell using a sensitive manometer. We analysed He and\nAr isotopes, plus 22Ne abundance on a Helix SFT mass-spectrometer. We also present new\nHe, Ne and Ar compositions obtained by step crushing on similar samples (DICE 10 and\nDICE 11).\n3He/4He isotopic ratios are homogeneous in all the vesicles and consistent with analyses\nby crushing, about 18Ra. Precise 40Ar/36Ar isotopic ratios were obtained on the largest\nvesicles only, due to high blank contribution to the smallest vesicles, and are about 9000,\ni.e. the highest values obtained by step-crushing. Considering that the Ar and He isotopic\ncompositions obtained on individual vesicles represent the mantle source values, not\ncontaminated by air, we can precisely correct the Ne isotopic analyses obtained by crushing\nfrom air contamination; the corrected values are consistent with the value of neon-B, i.e.\nfavour the hypothesis that the neon in OIB has an irradiated meteorite origin rather than\npurely solar.",

            "abstract": "Microbial iron cycling plays an essential role in biogeochemistry, but iron-cycling microbial ecosystems are mainly studied in situ, making it difficult to apply well-controlled perturbations. The iron cycle is strongly coupled to other biogeochemical cycles (particularly the sulfur cycle) and thus its response to perturbations has wide significance. The microbial iron cycle in glacial environments is important as glacial runoff is thought to contribute significant concentrations of free iron to the global iron cycle annually. We have used iron-cycling sediment-water microbial microcosms (Winogradsky columns) as a controlled experimental model in which to study the response to perturbations of iron-cycling microbial ecosystems, using sediment from a high altitude glacial meltwater stream. The microbial iron cycle in glacial environments is important as glacial runoff is thought to contribute significant concentrations of free iron to the global iron cycle annually. We analyse ecosystem state by measuring detailed depth profiles of free iron and oxygen. Upon adding organic matter we observe a sudden transition to a reduced state (dominated by Fe2+) . We hypothesize that this occurs because higher concentrations of organic matter stimulate the microbial reduction of ferrihydrite (the iron source), by providing increased availability of electron donors for the reduction of iron. Using high-throughput sequencing we also analyse how the microbial community changes with the perturbation. As well as providing insight into present-day biogeochemical cycles, our results may also have implications for ancient environments, such as ferruginous Proterozoic oceans.",

            "abstract": "In June and July 2013 the Saharan Aerosol Long-range Transport and Aerosol-Cloud-Interaction Experiment (SALTRACE) took place at Barbados to investigate long-range transported dust after its transport over the Atlantic Ocean. Ground-based lidar measurements were performed to characterize the optical properties of long-range transported dust, and to investigate possible changes of the optical properties during transport. Measurements of the particle linear depolarization ratio (PLDR) at 355 nm and 532 nm and of the vibrational Raman signals at 387 nm and 607 nm were conducted with the small portable lidar system POLIS of the Meteorological Institute (MIM) of the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München in cooperation with the Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IPA) of the German Aerospace Centre (DLR). The measurements were performed in a routine manner every day for 3 hours starting at sunrise and another 3 hours starting at sunset (combined Raman and PLDR). During heavy dust events or during the formation of tropical storm Chantal measurements were performed continuously up to 48 hours.\nDuring SALTRACE the vertical aerosol distribution was dominated by a three layer structure. The boundary layer was dominated by marine air masses in most of the cases. Above the boundary layer a mixing layer with very variable structure was found up to heights of 1.5 km to 2 km. This layer was often affected by cumulus clouds. The Saharan dust layer was observed in a height range of about 2 km to about 3.5 km. In some cases the upper boundary was even 5 km.\nIn our presentation we will give an overview over the general measurement situation and the POLIS measurements. We will present first results of the PLDR and the lidar ratio of long-range transported dust, as well as of the marine dominated air masses in the boundary layer. Furthermore we will compare our findings with results found for fresh Saharan dust and dust at the beginning of the long-range transport investigated during the Saharan Mineral Dust Experiment (SAMUM).",

This event nucleated in Northern Chile and broke the southern ~100 km of the ~500 km Northern Chile Southern Peru seismic gap, which had not seen an earthquake of this magnitude since the M~9 event of 1877. TE activated two main co-seismic slip patches: one around the epicenter and another north-east of the Mejillones Peninsula. We have applied the Lin and Shearer approach [1] to the aftershock sequence of TE. In this approach, the relative time shift between the S phases of a pair of nearby events at one station are plotted as function of the time shift between the P phases of the same pair. The process is repeated for a set of events. If the events are close enough to assume a uniform local Vp/Vs and the P-reciprocal wavefront can be approximated as planar, the points lay on a line, whose slope is an estimation of the local Vp/Vs. The technique is extended to a set of stations demeaning the time shifts from each pair of events. The time shifts are inferred maximizing the cross-correlation function between the event pairs. The technique has been applied to clusters of events sharing similar waveforms and spatially clustered hypocentres. We have adopted a robust linear L2 regression and have assigned a statistical error to the best fit. Most clusters are identified within a sub-vertical branch of the subduction interface hosting a major aftershock (Michilla earthquake, 16/12/2007, Ml 6.8) and its aftershocks. This branch falls inside the subducted Nazca Plate at depths of 40-50 km, north-east of the Mejillones Peninsula, and shows Vp/Vs mostly in the range 1.8-1.9. Clusters close to the Mejillones Peninsula and to the epicenter displays Vp/Vs around 1.7 and 1.8, respectively. ",

Traditionally, it was obtained by calculating equilibrium temperatures for the mantle xenoliths using thermometers based on major element compositions of coexisting minerals. A REE-in-two-pyroxene thermometer developed by Liang et al. (2013) is able to extract near-solidus temperatures，which can deduce the thermal histories of mantle rocks in combination with major-element-in-two-pyroxene temperatures (Tmaj). We calculated REE temperatures (TREE) for mantle samples from the NCC including ancient refractory peridotites entrained by Early Cretaceous high-Mg diorites from the central NCC (Fushan), Mantle pyroxenites entrained by Early Cretaceous basalts from the eastern NCC (Feixian and Fangcheng), and fertile/moderately depleted peridotites entrained by <100 Ma basalts from the central and eastern NCC. The Fushan peridotites have low Tmaj (<880°C) and mismatched high TREE (780-1150°C), indicating that the ancient mantle was subjected to melt-rock reactions. The Feixian and Fangcheng pyroxenites have both high Tmaj (>890°C) and high TREE - Tmaj values (80-220°C), suggestive of a hot and fast-cooled mantle in Early Cretaceous. The peridotites in <100 Ma basalts have similar TREE and Tmaj, characteristics of well-equilibrated mantle.\nBased on the thermometric data, we suggest that the transition of nature of the NCC lithospheric mantle is marked by the interaction between ancient lithospheric mantle and hot melt derived from recycling lower crust in Early Cretaceous. After that a fertile mantle was accreted from upwelling asthenosphere, which accomplished the replacement of the NCC lithsospheric mantle.\n",

            "abstract": "The Paleogene-Neogene sedimentary rocks in the Katawaz remnant ocean basin, Pakistan were thought to be a product of a fan-deltaic system, analogous to the modern Indus River and delta. A preliminary detrital zircon U-Pb study (Carter et al 2010) supported materials derived from the nascent western Himalaya and associated magmatic arc but that study was based on too few samples to fully characterize the whole series. Moreover, the chronology in the Katawaz basin was previously not well constrained, which impedes accurate comparison to other Himalaya foreland records.\nHere, we present a densely sampled study of detrital white mica 40Ar/39Ar. This study aims to: (1) constrain sedimentary ages of major lithostratigraphic units, (2) understand the exhumation history of the source region, and (3) reconstruct the paleodrainage system in NW Himalayan foreland. New 40Ar/39Ar data, together with a complementary study of detrital zircon U-Pb, constrain the sand-rich, fluvial-dominated Shaigalu Member to span from <34-36 Ma (basal sample) to <22 Ma (uppermost sample). The basal Shaigalu Member demonstrates similarity of ages of detrital zircon U-Pb and detrital white mica 40Ar/39Ar; both are characterized by a dominant peak of ca. 37 Ma. The dominant 37 Ma peak of detrital white mica 40Ar/39Ar ages has also been identified in the late Eocene Balakot Formation (Najman et al. 2001), the oldest terrestrial unit in the Himalayan peripheral foreland basin, and which is Himalayan-derived. We interpret the similarity in youngest age peak (37 Ma) between U-Pb and 40Ar/39Ar as a signal of rapid exhumation related to a rising western Himalaya. Our new 40Ar/39Ar data also reveal that sediment sources changed through time, as demonstrated by the disappearance of the 37 Ma population up-section and re-occurrence at the top. This could be related to either migration of the drainage system and/or changes in sediment sources. Finally, our study indicates that the latest Eocene rapid exhumation in the western Himalaya was coeval with its eastern counterpart, as observed in sedimentary records in Bengal Basin, Bangladesh (Najman et al 2008). Both reveal that detritus that reached the remnant ocean basins in west and east were archives of early orogenesis of the Himalaya.",

We used Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) terrestrial water storage observations and a global forest cover change product to investigate trends in terrestrial water storage associated with land use conversion in Indonesian peatlands between 2002 and 2012. Our initial analysis indicated that secular trends in GRACE terrestrial water storage were consistent with the spatial distribution of peatlands drained for the establishment of oil palm plantations. A decreasing trend in GRACE terrestrial water storage measurements over the observation period indicated a substantial decrease in water table heights. Combining this information with measurements of bulk density and carbon content of surface peat layers, we estimated potential emissions from carbon stocks now vulnerable to oxidation. Independent measurements of fire carbon emissions were used to estimate the fraction of committed emission that was combusted. Our research represents the first known application of GRACE data to assess loss of soil carbon storage associated with depletion of soil water.",

Using SDO/HMI vector magnetic field measurements we calculate vertical electric currents and discuss their role in the flare energy release. We argue that the observed fine structuring of the flare ribbons can be associated with dissipation of electric currents in the partially ionized chromospheric plasma. We also discuss the role of electric currents in two flares with sunquakes: C7.0 flare of Febrary 17, 2013, and M9.2 flare of July 30, 2011. We find that the observed sunquake impacts do not spatially correlate with the strongest HXR emission sources but coincide with the intensive electric currents. These observations suggest that the primary energy release can be connected with rapid dissipation of electric currents in the low atmosphere. We also conclude that the fine structuring of the electric currents may play a very important role, as it leads to enhanced and fast magnetic energy release, especially in the case of turbulent and ambipolar resistivity which can take place in the low solar atmosphere.",

Possibly increasing magnitude and area of oxygen depletion in these regions, might endanger rich pelagic fish habitats in the future threatening the global marine food supply. By the use of a quantitative redox proxy in OMZs, reconstruction of the temporal variation in OMZ extension eventually providing information about past and future changes in oxygenation and the anthropogenic role in the recent trend of expanding OMZs(2).\nRecent work has shown that iodine/calcium (I/Ca) ratios in marine carbonates are a promising proxy for ambient oxygen concentration(3). Our study explores the correlation of I/Ca ratios in four benthic foraminiferal species (three calcitic, one aragonitic) from the Peruvian OMZ to bottom water oxygen concentrations ([O2]BW) and evaluates foraminiferal I/Ca ratios as a possible redox proxy for the ambient water masses. Our results show that all species have a positive trend in the I/Ca ratios as a function of [O2]BW. Only for the aragonitic species Hoeglundina elegans this trend is not significant. The highest significance has been found for Uvigerina striata (I/Ca = 0.032(±0.004).[O2]BW + 0.29(±0.03), R² = 0.61, F = 75, P < 0.0001). Although I/Ca ratios in benthic foraminifera appear to be a robust redox proxy there are some methodical issues which have to be considered. These “pitfalls” include: (i) the volatility of iodine in acidic solutions, (ii) a species dependency of the I/Ca-[O2]BW relationship which is either related to a strong vital effect or toa species dependency on the calcification depth within sediment, and (iii) the inter-test variability of I/Ca between different specimens from the same species and habitat.\n(1): FAO FishStat: Fisheries and aquaculture software.

Several studies have demonstrated that using complementary remotely sensed datasets such as soil moisture for model calibration have led to improvements. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of remotely sensed signal of the Global Flood Detection System (GFDS) as a proxy for stream flow data to calibrate a global hydrological model used in operational flood forecasting. This is done in different river basins located in Africa, South and North America for the time period 1998-2010 by comparing model calibration using the raw satellite signal as a proxy for river discharge with a model calibration using in situ stream flow observations. River flow is simulated using the LISFLOOD hydrological model for the flow routing in the river network and the groundwater mass balance. The model is set up on global coverage with horizontal grid resolution of 0.1 degree and daily time step for input/output data. Based on prior tests, a set of seven model parameters was used for calibration. The parameter space was defined by specifying lower and upper limits on each parameter. The objective functions considered were Pearson correlation (R), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency log (NSlog) and Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE’) where both single- and multi-objective functions were employed. After multiple iterations, for each catchment, the algorithm generated a set of Pareto-optimal front of solutions. A single parameter set was selected which had the lowest distance to R=1 for the single-objective and NSlog=1 and KGE’=1 for the multi-objective function. The results of the different test river basins are compared against the performance obtained using the same objective functions by in situ discharge observations. Automatic calibration strategies of the global hydrological model using satellite data as a proxy for stream flow data are outlined and discussed.",

Izumi et al (2013, GRL) and Li et al (2013, GRL) showed that several relationships and robust patterns occur in climate simulations across different climate states (i.e. past (cold), present, and future (warm)), and used paleo- and modern environmental data to provide some independent evidence for those relationships and patterns. Izumi et al (2014, Clim Dyn) examined the possibility that a small set of common mechanisms controls large-scale responses using a simple energy-balance model to decompose the temperature changes shown in multiple simulations. These and other studies demonstrate the way in which paleoclimate simulations are useful adjuncts to analyses of modern-day climates in understanding the fundamental mechanisms of climate changes.\nHere, we further investigate change in the surface clear-sky longwave downward radiation, which is a key control of large-scale temperature responses such as land-ocean contrast and high-latitude amplification, by decomposing the this component into to direct longwave feedback, water vapor effect, and CO2 effect in a simple energy balance model. We also discuss the residual term in the decomposition, which measures the difference between the simulated CMIP5 surface temperature and surface temperature estimated by the energy balance model. In addition, we investigate the key mechanisms in mid-Holocene vs piControl climates in order to compare the responses from orbitally induced changes in insolation with the responses induced by changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration. Finally, we explore other large-scale climate responses under different climate states, in particular precipitation and water-balance variables over land, focusing on the large-scale atmospheric circulation of moisture variations.",

For the latter source, atmospheric waves such as tides and planetary waves are generated in the moist convection, which propagate through the middle atmosphere affected by various dynamical processes such as their interactions with the mean zonal wind and other waves, and reach the lower thermosphere where they induce dynamo electric fields. According to the recent satellite and ground-based observations, the characteristics of tides and planetary waves in the lower thermosphere are becoming known more clearly, such as the seasonal and latitude variations of major tides, planetary wave-like oscillations, and irregular variations during stratospheric sudden warming, and so on. In this paper, we use a whole atmosphere-ionosphere coupled model called GAIA, and have carried out a simulation from 1996 to 2013 with realistic forcing from the lower atmosphere by nudging the meteorological reanalysis (JRA) into the model. By analyzing the long-term model data, we investigate how the tidal variability and planetary waves in the lower thermosphere produce the seasonal and day-to-day variations in the dynamo electric field as well as the origin of the variations in the lower and middle atmospheres.",

It has been proposed that artificially increasing ocean albedo could restore sea ice, but the climate impacts of such a strategy have not been previously explored. Motivated by this, in this study we investigate the effects of ocean albedo alteration on Arctic sea ice recovery and Northern Hemisphere climate.\nUsing a Community Earth System Model, in a set of idealized model simulations with altered ocean albedo values, we show that partial sea ice recovery is possible even in very warm climates. However, our simulations reveal that there is only modest impact on Arctic temperatures indicating that this method cannot substantially offset the overall effects of human induced warming. Moreover, in our simulations, the effects of sea ice changes are not limited to the Arctic, but also affect precipitation distribution over the continental United States. For example, following sea ice recovery, wetter and milder winter conditions are expected in the North American southwest.",

            "abstract": "Evaporation sources and meteorological conditions at the source of evaporation are important variables affecting the stable isotopes in water vapour. Isotopes therefore provide complimentary information to more conventional techniques used in land-atmosphere exchange studies. Augmenting in-situ water vapour isotope measurements, soil and plant water isotopic analysis, and meteorological measurements collected during a 2 week field campaign to a semi-arid grassland site in NSW, Australia, the relationship between land-atmosphere exchange processes and the water vapour isotopic composition was investigated. Back-trajectory analysis was used to provide insight into the role of large scale hydrological processes on the water vapour isotopic composition. During the campaign clear dry conditions were observed leading to strong diurnal cycles for the evapotranspiration fluxes. For diurnal times, the d-excess of the water vapour showed a strong relationship with the evapotranspiration fluxes. During the morning transition period when the convective boundary layer was being established and evapotranspiration fluxes were increasing, the d-excess increased sharply. Plant and soil water samples indicated non-steady state transpiration fluxes led to these higher values. In the afternoon when the evapotranspiration fluxes decreased and the humidity approached saturation, the d-excess of water vapour declined approaching values approximately in equilibrium with the soil water. On the other hand, the diurnal cycle of the δ2H did not show a consistent trend with the local meteorology, but showed a stronger relationship with the sea surface temperature of the oceanic moisture source and dehydration pathways during transport of atmospheric moisture to the site. The interpretation from these results indicates that the d-excess variable may be a better variable for investigating local land-atmosphere exchange as the δ2H is strongly influenced by changes in the synoptic scale meteorology.

            "abstract": "Ship engine emissions are important regarding lung and cardiovascular diseases in coastal regions worldwide. Bio mass burning is made responsible for adverse health effects in many cities and rural regions. The Virtual Helmholtz Institute-HICE (www.hice-vi.eu) addresses chemical & physical properties and health effects of anthropogenic combustion emissions. Typical lung cell responses to combustion aerosols include inflammation and apoptosis, but a molecular link with the specific chemical composition in particular of ship emissions has not been established. Through an air-liquid interface exposure system (ALI), we exposed human lung cells at-site to exhaust fumes from a ship engine running on common heavy fuel oil (HFO) and cleaner-burning diesel fuel (DF) as well as to emissions of wood combustion compliances. A special field deployable ALI-exposition system and a mobile S2-biological laboratory were developed for this study. Human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549 etc.) are ALI-exposed to fresh, diluted (1:40-1:100) combustion aerosols and subsequently were toxicologically and molecular-biologically characterized. Advanced chemical analyses of the exhaust aerosols were combined with transcriptional, proteomic and metabolomic profiling to characterise the cellular responses. The HFO ship emissions contained high concentrations of toxic compounds (transition metals, organic toxicants) and particle masses. The cellular responses included inflammation and oxidative stress. Surprisingly, the DF ship emissions, which predominantly contain rather “pure” carbonaceous soot and much less known toxicants, induced significantly broader biological effects, affecting essential cellular pathways (e.g., mitochondrial function and intracellular transport). Therefore the use of distillate fuels for shipping (this is the current emission reduction strategy of the IMO) appears insufficient for diminishing health effects. The study suggests rather reducing the particle emissions by secondary measures (filters) than shifting the fuel. In the case of wood combustion the reduction of soot and carcinogenic aromatic compounds is suggested. However, for both sources (wood and ship diesel) we found that effects of the gaseous pollutants (e.g. aldehydes) are potentially problematic.",

            "abstract": "Here we present two well-resolved, calcite δ18O records on Myanmar speleothems. The samples were collected from a coastal site in southeastern Myanmar and a plateau site in central Myanmar, respectively. Chronologically determined by high-precision U/Th dating techniques, both records span a large portion of the past 40,000 years. The two records show similar millennial-scale oscillations during the last glacial period, which are also in-phase with the speleothem records from Chinese cave sites located in the downstream of Indian Monsoon trajectories.\nThe δ18O values between the two profiles are virtually the same, ~ -7.5‰, during late Holocene, in concert with the numbers in modern rainfall at the two sites. However, in glacial time, the δ18O value of the central Myanmar record shifts from -6.5‰ to -8‰, approximately 2‰ lower than that in the coastal dataset, which varies from -4.5‰ to -6‰. We interpret the similarly low δ18O values during Holocene in both records as a result of strong monsoonal rainfall and water recycling particularly through forest transpiration. However in glacial time, with a possibly drier and less forested land, water recycling is weaker. Therefore, rainfall δ18O and subsequently speleothem δ18O appear a stronger geographical gradient, possibly dominated by the continental rainout effect.\nOur interpretation can be supported by the speleothem δ13C records from the two sites. Calcite δ13C from the coastal site varies slightly from ~-7‰ in the last glacial to ~-9‰ in Holocene. Whereas it shares a similar value to the coastal record during Holocene, the δ13C profile from the plateau site shows a much higher value, up to -0.7‰, during the glacial time. This suggests that the mountainous region in central Myanmar was likely dominated by C4 plants (e.g., grass) during the glacial time, while the same region is covered by forests today. Such change on vegetation type and coverage may influence the δ18O of recycling moisture transported further inland.",

            "abstract": "Debris avalanches derived from the flanks of volcanic islands are among the largest on Earth. Debris avalanches are rare, catastrophic destabilizations that still keep geologists debating about the mechanisms that initiate them and make them travel huge runout distances.\nTo shed light on the trigger of such destabilizations, we studied the inland scar of a debris avalanche deposit cropping out at Piton des Neiges, a dormant and eroded basaltic volcano of La Réunion Island. The avalanche deposit rests on a pile of 50-70 sill intrusions with a shallow northward dip, i.e. toward the sea. We measured the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility in a transect across the uppermost sill of the pile in contact with the avalanche deposit. This transect reveals a strongly asymmetric magnetic fabric, consistent with a north-directed shear movement of the upper intrusion wall. This suggests that the upper sill induced a co-intrusive shear displacement of the volcano flank toward the sea.\nThe upper sill margin in contact with the avalanche is striated, showing that this intrusion is older than the avalanche. Striae indicate a northward direction of avalanche runout. The upper sill margin also displays a magmatic lineation consistent with a magma flow in the intrusion toward the north. There is thus a striking kinematic consistency between the directions of intrusion propagation and avalanche runout, both oriented toward the sea.\nFrom the above results, we propose that repeated sill intrusions, such as observed on Piton des Neiges, increase the instability of a volcanic edifice. Each injection induces an incremental slip of the overlying rock mass, which may eventually end up into a landslide. Sill intrusions associated with seaward displacements of volcano flank, such as inferred for the April 2007 eruption of Piton de la Fournaise (also in La Réunion), should therefore be considered as a potential trigger of debris avalanches.",

            "abstract": "The state of solar wind ions is generally described by a small set of state variables. In detail these are\ntotal density (or flux), center of mass (or bulk) velocity, and temperature. These variables are obtained\nfrom measured velocity distributions either by fitting a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution or by calculating\nthe zeroth, first, and second order moments of the distribution. Obviously the first approach requires a\nthermalized distribution to yield meaningful results, while the second approach is universally valid.\nHowever, in both cases the shape of the distribution can not be reproduced by the derived parameters.\nFrom observations of solar wind protons and alpha particles it is known that the assumption of a thermalized\ndistribution is not valid, at least for the majority of observations. For heavy solar wind ions most observations\nare severely limited by statistics and do not even allow to distinguish whether the distribution is thermal or not.\nThis often insufficient characterization of the solar wind VDF severely limits the information which can be\nobtained for more detailed studies, especially about microscopic kinetic physics and the associated\nwave-particle interactions. These naturally yield deviations from Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions.\nTo address this problem we have analyzed ten years worth of data from the Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer (SWICS)\nand the Magnetometer (MAG) on the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE). From our analysis we obtained reduced 1D\nvelocity spectra in 12 minute cadence for some 40 solar wind ions, from protons and alpha particles up to iron.\nUsing the magnetic field vector information we were able to study periods where the reduced 1D spectra represent\nthe parallel and perpendicular shape of the velocity distributions. We present our results and discuss\nthem in the aforementioned context.",

The review and update was conducted by an international team, drawn from both the biological science and Mars exploration communities, to understand when and where Special Regions could, and likely do, occur. The study applied recently available data about Mars environments and about Earth organisms, building on a previous analysis of Mars Special Regions (2006) undertaken by a similar team. Since then, a large new body of highly relevant data has been generated from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (launched 2005), Phoenix (2007), and from Mars Express and the twin MER landers (all 2003). Additional results were also gleaned from the Mars Science Laboratory (2011). In addition to Mars data, there is a considerable body of new data regarding the known environmental limits to life on Earth—including the potential for terrestrial microbial life to survive and replicate under martian environmental conditions.\nThe analysis of Mars Special Regions included:\n1. An extensive analysis of both new and previously unavailable data regarding the environmental limits of life on Earth, including both experimental results and environmental observations;\n2. An examination of extensive post-2006 observational data sets, including high spacial and temporal resolution data from orbit and new data from landed spacecraft;\n3. New models of Mars relevant to natural environmental variation in water activity and temperature;\n4. Review and reconsideration of the current parameters used to define Special Regions; and\n5. Updated maps and descriptions of the Mars environments that are recommended for treatment as “uncertain,” or “special”, including the identification of locations on Mars for which we cannot demonstrate are not special.\nSeveral significant changes in our appreciation of the capabilities of Earth organisms and the availability of Mars environments have led to a new appreciation of the potential for Mars Special Regions to be identified and protected.",

            "abstract": "Among Filipinos, a meal is most often considered incomplete without rice. There is a high regard for rice in the entire archipelago that in 2012, the country’s rice production was accounted to more than 18 million tons with an equivalent harvested area of 4.7 million hectares. This means that from the 5.4 million hectares of arable land in the Philippines, 11 percent are found and being utilized for rice production in Cagayan Valley (CV). In the same year, more than 13 percent of the country’s total annual rice production was produced in CV. Rice production also provides employment to 844,000 persons (out of 1.4 million persons) which suggest that occupation and livelihood in Cagayan Valley are strongly anchored in rice production.\nThese figures outline the imaginable vulnerability of rice production in CV amidst varying issues such as land conversion, urbanization, increase in population, retention of farming households, and climate change. While all these issues are of equal importance, this paper is directed towards the understanding the projected changes in seasonal rainfall and mean temperature (2011-2040). It is envisioned by this study that a successful climate change adaptation starts with the provision of climate projections hence this paper's objective to investigate on the changes in climate patterns and extreme events.\nProjected changes are zonally limited to the Provinces of Cagayan, Isabela, Nueva Vizcaya, and Quirino based on the statistical downscaling of three global climate models (BCM2, CNCM3, and MPEH5) and two emission scenarios (A1B and A2). With the idea that rainfall and temperature varies with topography, the AURELHY technique was utilized in interpolating climate projections. Results obtained from the statistical downscaling showed that there will be significant climate changes from 2011-2040 in terms of rainfall and mean temperature. There are also indications of increasing frequency of extreme 24-hour rainfall and number of dry days (especially in Tuguegarao City).\nThis study was forged in a partnership of PAGASA and FAO AMICAF. Further efforts to improve climate change adaptations in CV are directed towards provision of climate projections as input to crop and water resources modeling, market modeling, hunger and poverty reduction, and policy formulation.",

            "abstract": "Understanding potential risk of river flooding under future climate scenarios might be helpful for developing risk management strategies (including mitigation, adaptation). Such analyses are typically performed at the macro scales (e.g., regional, global) where the climate model output could support (e.g., Hirabayashi et al., 2013, Arnell and Gosling, 2014). To understand the potential benefits of infrastructure upgrading as part of climate adaptation strategies, it is also informative to understand the potential impact of different flood protection standards (in terms of return periods) on global river flooding under climate change. In this study, we use a baseline period (forced by observed hydroclimate conditions) and CMIP5 model output (historic and future periods) to drive a global river routing model called CaMa-Flood (Yamazaki et al., 2011) and simulate the river water depth at a spatial resolution of 15 min x 15 min. From the simulated results of baseline period, we use the annual maxima river water depth to fit the Gumbel distribution and prepare the return period-flood risk relationship (involving population and GDP). From the simulated results of CMIP5 model, we also used the annual maxima river water depth to obtain the Gumbel distribution and then estimate the exceedance probability (historic and future periods). We apply the return period-flood risk relationship (above) to the exceedance probability and evaluate the potential risk of river flooding and changes in the benefits of flood protection standard (e.g., 100-year flood of the baseline period) from the past into the future (represented by the representative concentration pathways). In this presentation, we show our preliminary results.   ",

            "abstract": "Effective adaptation to climate variability and change in the next few decades may require a probabilistic quantification of various possible outcomes. As such, quantifying the irreducible uncertainty due to chaotic climate variability in projections of near-term regional climate is essential. Here we use large initial condition ensembles of the FAMOUS global climate model with a 1%/year compound increase in CO2 levels to explore the role of both atmospheric and oceanic initial conditions in quantifying the range of future temperature projections. These simulations are the largest such ensembles to date - a total of over 17,000 simulated years. It is shown that short-term trends in global temperature can be very diverse, and cooling periods are more likely followed by more rapid rates of change. However, inter-annual temperature variability declines as the climate warms, especially over Europe, likely due to Arctic sea-ice retreat. In addition, a case study of the regional consequences of atmospheric initial condition uncertainty for Europe shows that at every land location, trends in temperature over the first 20 years of the transient simulation range from a cooling of more than 1K to a warming of more than 1K. However, on longer timescales, the signal of a warming climate becomes more clear. An ensemble using a range of oceanic initial conditions produces a larger spread in temperature trends than an ensemble using a single ocean initial condition for all lead times and seasons. Although FAMOUS likely exhibits too strong temperature variability, these results highlight the need for climate simulations to be performed with many more ensemble members than at present if the uncertainty in near-term climate is to be adequately quantified.",

            "abstract": "The Northern portion of the Chilean margin is considered to be a mature seismic gap based on the magnitude and time of the last great earthquake (Mw~8.8 in 1877), and the assumed long-term slip deficit accumulation rate (67mm/yr). The central fraction of the gap was affected by the April 1st 2014 Pisagua-Iquique earthquake (Mw=8.1), which was preceded by a long-lasting series of foreshocks with increasing magnitudes. The seismic gap has been extensively monitored by the Integrated Plate Boundary Observatory Chile (IPOC) with various geophysical and geodetic techniques . The excellent temporal and spatial coverage of the IPOC GPS network along the entire gap enable us to analyze the kinematics of the plate interface leading up to the mainshock with unprecedented resolution.\nWe use Finite-Element Modelling (FEM) to investigate the subduction zone mechanisms that are responsible for the observed GPS deformation field during the interseismic, coseismic and early postseismic periods. Furthermore, we separate the relative contributions of aseismic and seismic plate interface slip to the short-term elastic deformation leading up to and following the mainshock. GPS time-series show a trenchward acceleration between the March 16th Mw 6.7 foreshock and the mainshock. The cumulative continuous-GPS transient signals can be explained by the elastic displacement of the foreshocks suggesting the dominance of seismic slip leading up to the mainshock.\nBoth the slip distribution of the Pisagua-Iquique event, and its largest aftershock, correlate well with areas that were previously highly locked, and both were enclosed by creeping interface zones. Our model suggests that the plate interface geometry varies the fault normal stress distribution, which influences stress concentration and release in the central part of the gap. The first three months of postseismic ground surface displacement is greatest along the rupture area and in the northern adjacent segment with cumulative displacements of about 10 cm diminishing to the south of the rupture. The early postseismic displacement only accounts for less than 20 % of the total coseismic displacement. Slip deficit calculation shows that the unbroken locked regions of the remaining seismic gap could release an earthquake with a magnitude of 8.5.",

            "abstract": "For event attribution we need probability distributions of the quantity under consideration for both current conditions and pre-industrial conditions. These distributions will typically be calculated from large ensembles produced by a climate model and require large computational resources. Here we discuss an alternative based on a simple algorithm to produce ensembles of surrogate fields based on observations or a few climate model experiments.\nThis method can be seen as a field extension of bootstrapping as it produces surrogate fields with the same spatial and temporal structure (as measured with lagged cross-correlations) as the target field. We have previously used this method in tests of paleo-reconstruction methods and in a study of the significance of warm records.\nIn this study the method will be used for event detection. We will in particular be interested in recent European extreme warm events and cold spells. The method allow us to address issues such as the relative effects of the two aspects of climate change: the change in the mean and the change in the variance. We will also address the selection problem. Some studies consider a single geographical site where an extreme event has been observed and investigate the probabilities for such an event at that particular site. However, considering the probability for a similar event in an extended area will give different probabilities and may result in different conclusions regarding the attribution.",

            "abstract": "China has conducted series of air pollution control policies to reduce the pollutant emissions. Although not specifically for mercury (Hg), those policies are believed to have co-benefits on atmospheric Hg emission control. On the basis of field-tests data and updated information of energy conservation and emission control, we have developed multiple-year inventories of anthropogenic mercury emissions in China from 2005 to 2012. Three scenarios (scenario 0(S0), scenario 1(S1), scenario 2(S2)) with different emission controls and energy path are designed for prediction of the future Hg emissions for the country. In particular, comprehensive assessments has been conducted to evaluate the evolution of emission factors, recent emission trends, effects of control measures as well as the reliability of our results. The national total emissions of anthropogenic Hg are estimated to increase from 679.0 metric tons (t) in 2005 to 749.8 t in 2012, with the peak at 770.6 t in 2011. The annual growth rate of emissions can then be calculated at 2.1% during 2005-2011, much lower than that of energy consumption or economy of the country. Coal combustion, gold metallurgy and nonferrous metal smelting are the most significant Hg sources of anthropogenic origin, accounting together for 85% of national total emissions. Tightened air pollution controls in China should be important reasons for the smooth emission trends. Compared with 2005, 299 t Hg were reduced in 2010 from power plants, iron and steel smelting, nonferrous-smelting and cement production, benefiting from the improvement of control measures for those sectors. The speciation of Hg emissions is relatively stable for recent years, with the mass fractions of around 55%, 9% and 6% for Hg0, Hg2+ and Hgp respectively. Integrating the policy commitments on energy saving, different from the most conservative case S0, S2 shares the same energy path with S1, but includes more stringent emission control. Under those scenarios, we predict China’s atmospheric Hg emissions are 814, 805, and 620 t for 2015, 844, 823, and 621t for 2020, and 869, 813t, and 579t for 2030. Compared to levels of energy consumption and industrial production, policies on emission control would have greater benefits for Hg abatement for the country.",

            "abstract": "Delineation of changes in eolian sources recorded in deep-sea sediment cores provides valuable insight into past atmospheric circulation and global climate change. Inorganic silicate fractions of samples from ODP Leg 199, Hole 1215A, located in the central Pacific Ocean (26°N, 147.5°W), were investigated for 143Nd/144Nd compositions, in order to constrain the sources of eolian dust and determine the latitudinal position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) recorded in the core. 143Nd/144Nd values of eolian dust show a close agreement with those of Asian dust for the last 20 million years, but are much higher than those of Asian dust for the most of 20 - 30 Ma period. Drastic shift in 143Nd/144Nd values at ~20 Ma is associated with changes in compositions of other geochemical attributes (Eu anomaly and La/Sc, Ziegler et al., 2007, EPSL, v. 254, 416-432), indicating changes in sources of eolian dust at ~ 20 Ma. Geochemical compositions of eolian dust in the 20-30 Ma section resemble those of southeast equatorial Pacific surface and down-core dust records. The observed changes, thus, are attributed to the shift of its eolian dust sources from South/Central American to Asian dust due to the southward movement of the ITCZ over the study site. Our results indicate paleolocation of the ITCZ at ~ 20°N at 20 Ma. An exceptional 143Nd/144Nd value at ~28 Ma revealing Asian dust signal might indicate that the ITCZ had fluctuated in a wide latitudinal range during the 20 - 30 Ma period characterized by a series of glacial episodes.",

Many aftershocks occurred following the mainshock in the southern part of Japan Trench. To obtain a precise aftershock activity is important for understanding the mechanism of earthquake generation, and the recovery of plate coupling at a ruptured plate boundary. However, it is difficult to determine the precise aftershock distribution by land seismic station data. In order to study the aftershock activity, we had deployed 66 long-term ocean bottom seismometers(LTOBS) off the coast of Ibaraki and the Boso Peninsula from October 2011 to November 2012.\nMost of the hypocenter locations have a depth shallower than 40km. The earthquakes form a plane dipping landward in the study area. Comparing the hypocenter locations with crustal structures obtained by active seismic studies (e.g. Miura et al., 2003). Many events occurred along the plate boundary. We also compared the hypocenter locations with aftershock distribution of the seismic observation conducted immediately after 2011 Tohoku Earthquake (Shinohara et al., 2012). Shinohara et al., (2012) reported that the low seismicity region has seen at the shallow part of the plate interface in the off-Fukushima. On the other hand, our results showed the seismicity is not low at the same region. This difference may reflect the change of stress fields at a ruptured plate boundary.",

This region has also been designated as a federal ozone non-attainment area by the U.S. EPA. High ozone levels are a significant health concern, as are potential health impacts from chronic exposure to primary emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) for residents living near wells. Here we present observations of ambient atmospheric VOC present in residential areas located in close proximity to wells in Erie, Colorado, and show that the C2-C5 alkanes are enhanced by a factor of 18 – 77 relative to the regional background, and present at higher levels than typically found in large urban centers. These data are combined with VOC observations from downtown Denver and Platteville, as well as with measurements conducted this summer in conjunction with the FRAPPE and DISCOVER-AQ flight campaigns, to investigate the spatial distribution of VOC enhancements in correlation with proximity to oil and gas production areas. We show that these compounds, including the BTEX aromatics, are elevated across the NFR, with highest levels in communities within the Greater Wattenberg Gas Field. These analyses demonstrate that VOC emissions from oil and gas operations represent a large area source for ozone precursors in the NFR.",

            "abstract": "We live in an age where the volume of content available online to the general public is staggering. Integration of data from new technologies gives us amazing educational opportunities when appropriate narratives are provided. We prepared a distance learning credit bearing module that showcased many currently available data sets and state of the art technologies. It has been completed by many thousands of students with good feedback. Module highlights were the wide ranging and varied online activities which taught a wide range of STEM content. For example: it is well known that on Captain Scott’s Terra Nova Expedition 1910–13, three researchers completed the “the worst journey in the world” to study emperor penguins. Using their primary records and clips from location filmed television documentaries we can tell their story and the reasons why it was important. However using state of the art content we can go much further. Using satellite data students can trace the path the researchers took and observe the penguin colony that they studied. Linking to modern Open Access literature students learn how they can estimate the numbers of animals in this and similar locations. Then by linking to freely available data from Antarctic Automatic Weather Stations students can learn quantitatively about the climatic conditions the animals are enduring in real time. They can then download and compare this with the regional climatic record to see if their observations are what could be expected. By considering the environment the penguins live in students can be taught about the evolutionary and behavioural adaptations the animals have undergone to survive. In this one activity we can teach a wide range of key learning points in an engaging and coherent way. It opened some students’ eyes to the range of possibilities available to learn about our, and other planets. The addition and integration of new state of the art techniques and data sets only increases the opportunities to teach STEM in ways that truly grab attention.",

            "abstract": "Plate tectonics is based on a concept that a rigid lithosphere moves over a weaker asthenosphere. Understanding of the plate tectonics is important to understand the Earth's system. However, the nature of the lithosphere and asthenosphere boundary (LAB) is not yet well determined. To understand the physical condition for the LAB, we have conduct a seafloor observation called \" Normal Oceanic Mantle (NOMan) Project\". We focused on the oceanic plate because the nature and evolution history of the oceanic plate is simpler than the continental plate so that it is easier to investigate its nature.\nTo analyze the upper mantle structures around the LAB, we conducted a seismic explosion experiments as a part of NOMan project.\nSeismic explosion experiments were conducted at four shot sites with ten broadband ocean bottom seismometers and the size of explosions is 400 kg at two sites, and 200 kg at other sites. The profile lengths are about 700 and 400 km, respectively. Previous studies in this area revealed the azimuthal anisotropy in the uppermost lithosphere (Shinohara et al., 2008), a sharp LAB at a depth of ~ 80 km (Kawakatsu et al. 2009), small-scale heterogeneities in the lithosphere (Shito et al., 2013).\nAfter explosion experiments, we recovered five BBOBSs. Rest of them will be recovered at this September.",

            "abstract": "The volcanic El Quemado Complex was deposited during the breakup of Gondwana during the Middle and Late Jurassic. It is part of a large silicic igneous province, which includes the Chon Aike Province in Southern Patagonia and related rocks from the Antarctic Peninsula [1]. The Complex consists of rhyolitic and dacitic ignimbrites and air-fall tuffs, intercalated with andesitic to rhyolitic lava flows. New LA-ICPMS U/Pb-dates of zircons from the Fitz Roy area yield ages between 148 and 153Ma. No inherited zircons were found, suggesting that the temperature of 850°C calculated from zircon saturation is a minimum temperature. Lava flows are typically rich in quartz phenocrysts, which preserved magmatic trace element zoning, as revealed by cathodoluminescence (CL): light cores are surrounded by several darker and lighter zones towards the rim. The δ18O-values for quartz of between 11 to 14 ‰ are compatible with a crustal source for the magma and the SIMS analyses of phenocrysts reveal no zoning in O-isotope compositions.\nHigh-resolution Ti-profiles were obtained by NanoSIMS with a beam size of ~200 nm and a minimum step size of ~120 nm. Several lines perpendicular to the magmatic zoning of the quartz-phenocrysts were measured. The profiles show sharp changes in the 48Ti/29Si-ratio over a distance of 5 μm, which correlate with CL-intensity changes. The profiles can be used for diffusion chronometry. The distances obtained from NanoSIMS profiles were used to calculate maximum diffusional relaxation times. Assuming a step function as initial condition and extrusion temperatures from zircon saturation of 850°C, we obtain a maximum residence time for the quartz-phenocrysts of 3.5 years.\n[1] Pankhurst R.J., Riley T.R., Fanning C.M., Kelley S.P., 2000.

            "abstract": "Direct in-situ measurements of the velocity distributions of plasma particles in the solar wind reveal two distinct components: a Maxwellian (thermal) core, and a less dense but hotter halo in the high-energy (suprathermal) tails of the distribution, which are well-described by Kappa power-laws. Despite these evidences, the present attempts to parameterize the observed anisotropy and the resulting plasma wave instabilities are limited to idealized models of the distributions. These are, for instance, simplified models which ignore the suprathermal populations, or minimize the role of the core, assuming this component is cold, and model only the suprathermal tails with a Kappa distribution function. It is worthwhile to asses to which extent these models are relevant in realistic situations. Here, we present a comparative analysis with more realistic approaches, which combine a Maxwellian core, and one or two Kappa distributed components (the halo and the field-aligned strahl in the fast wind). A comparison is provided for the particular case of the cyclotron instabilities, which enables us to emphasize the effects produced by the thermal spread of plasma particles from the core, and extend approaching complex situations frequently observed in the solar wind, when both the core and halo populations are anisotropic. Correlated with the radial profile of Kappa components in the heliosphere, these effects help us to build a realistic picture on the role played by these instabilities in major processes like heating and energy dissipation in the solar wind.",

            "abstract": "The Tista River, a major tributary of the Brahmaputra drainage system (Eastern Himalaya -Sikkim) has recently incised its megafan at the topographic front of the mountain range by 30 meters. Neither the timing of deposition/incision of the megafan sediments, nor the erosion rates of the source areas have yet been investigated in detail.\nTo constrain erosion rates in the hinterland at different temporal scales, we report cosmogenic nuclide (10Be) and thermochronological (apatite fission-track) data on modern river sands and map the results to evidence spatial variations of erosion/exhumation rates in Sikkim. Millennial erosion rates are significantly higher than geological exhumation rates, display stronger spatial variability and a contrasting pattern, suggesting that the processes controlling these rates are decoupled. Strong exhumation rates at geological timescales in southwest Sikkim (1.2 mm.yr-1) may be structurally controlled by uplift of the Lesser Himalayan duplex, while strong erosion rates at millennial scales in north Sikkim (5-6 mm.yr-1) suggest a climatic control.\nCosmogenic nuclides were also used to date the onset of incision of the megafan. In addition, isotope geochemistry (εNd, 87Sr/86Sr) on modern river sands and late-Quaternary megafan sediments allows characterizing the isotopic signature of the different source areas and constraining variations in provenance of the Tista megafan deposits through time. Results show that the Tista fan deposits are mainly sourced from the High Himalayan Crystalline domain with excursions more influenced by the Lesser Himalaya domain. These results are consistent with the higher erosion rates identified in north Sikkim at millennial timescale.\nThese data provide a new comprehensive view on modern erosion and long-term exhumation of the Sikkim Himalaya. This study will help our knowledge and understanding of erosional processes and sediment fluxes in mountainous environments as a function of climate and tectonics.",

            "abstract": "Water supply sources for irrigation (e.g. rivers and reservoirs) are critically important for agricultural productivity. The current rapid increase in irrigation water use is considered unsustainable and threatens food production. In this study, we estimated the time-varying dependence of irrigation water requirements from water supply sources, with a particular focus on variations in irrigation area during past (1960–2001) and future (2002–2050) periods using the global water resources model, H08. The H08 model can simulate water requirements on a daily basis at a resolution of 1.0° × 1.0° latitude and longitude. The sources of irrigation water requirements in the past simulations were specified using four categories: rivers (RIV), large reservoirs (LR), medium-size reservoirs (MSR), and non-local non-renewable blue water (NNBW). The simulated results from 1960 to 2001 showed that RIV, MSR and NNBW increased significantly from the 1960s to the early 1990s globally, but LR increased at a relatively low rate. After the early 1990s, the increase in RIV declined as it approached a critical limit, due to the continued expansion of irrigation area. MSR and NNBW increased significantly, during the same time period, following the expansion of the irrigation area and the increased storage capacity of the medium-size reservoirs. We also estimated future irrigation water requirements from the above four water supply sources and an additional water supply source (ADD) in three future simulation designs; irrigation area change, climate change, and changes in both irrigation area and climate. ADD was defined as a future increase in NNBW. After the 2020s, MSR was predicted to approach the critical limit, and ADD would account for 11–23% of the total requirements in the 2040s.",

            "abstract": "The frequent and, as yet, unpredictable transition from effusive to explosive volcanic behaviour is common to active composite volcanoes, yet our understanding of the processes which control this evolution is poor. The rheology of magma, dictated by its composition, porosity and crystal content, is integral to eruption behaviour and during ascent magma behaves in an increasingly rock-like manner. This behaviour, on short timescales in the upper conduit, provides exceptionally dynamic conditions that favour strain localisation and failure. Seismicity released by this process can be mimicked by damage accumulation that releases acoustic signals on the laboratory scale, showing that the failure of magma is intrinsically strain-rate dependent.\nThis character aids the development of shear zones in the conduit, which commonly fracture seismogenically, producing fault surfaces that control the last hundreds of meters of ascent by frictional slip. High-velocity rotary shear (HVR) experiments demonstrate that at ambient temperatures, gouge behaves according to Byerlee’s rule at low slip velocities. At rock-rock interfaces, mechanical work induces comminution of asperities and heating which, if sufficient, may induce melting and formation of pseudotachylyte. The viscosity of the melt, so generated, controls the subsequent lubrication or resistance to slip along the fault plane thanks to non-Newtonian suspension rheology. The bulk composition, mineralogy and glass content of the magma all influence frictional behaviour, which supersedes buoyancy as the controlling factor in magma ascent.\nIn the conduit of dome-building volcanoes, the fracture and slip processes are further complicated: slip-rate along the conduit margin fluctuates. The shear-thinning frictional melt yields a tendency for extremely unstable slip thanks to its pivotal position with regard to the glass transition. This thermo-kinetic transition bestows the viscoelastic melt with the ability to either flow or fracture: velocity-dependence then acts as an important feedback mechanism on the slip plane, accentuating stick-slip cycles that bring the magma, step-wise, to the surface accompanied by characteristic repetitive seismic events.",

            "abstract": "The last glacial-interglacial fluvial archive of the Upper Thames catchment, UK has received much attention over the past 50 years. Extensive exposures within the Pleistocene sequence have yielded a vast array of field observations, constrained by a substantive, but still inadequate, geochronological dataset. This catchment was not glaciated during this period, lying well beyond the Devensian (MIS2) ice margin, and thus landscape morphological evolution progressed largely in response to variation in fluvial and slope processes forced primarily by climate-driven hydrological and vegetation change. Furthermore, there is no evidence to support any significant tectonic-driven change, albeit fluvial system evolution progressed within the context of long-term regional uplift. The relative simplicity of process interactions within this catchment over the timeframe of interest, taken together with its comprehensive sedimentary record, makes the Upper Thames archive a good candidate for comparison with landscape evolution model outputs.\nIn this paper we present a ‘first look’ at the performance of PARALLEM, a new, parallel-coded, landscape evolution model, with results presented from an initial 50,000-year simulation. In this instance PARALLEM was deployed in annual, steady-flow mode. The model is driven by changing precipitation and temperatures. A pre-determined precipitation input data series was used, based upon a simple transfer function which utilises an up-sampled North Atlantic SST record, together with a modified temperature series based upon palaeoecological data. PARALLEM explicitly models mass-movement processes (i.e. creep, gelifluction) and surface erosion by flowing water (i.e. diffuse and concentrated erosion) using formulae derived from empirical modern-day process data. The model also deploys a simple logistic growth/die-back model for vegetation driven by hydrological and temperature change. Sediment transport is modelled using a modified transport-distance approach.\nComparison of the two datasets is problematical as there are few, if any, attributes that can directly be compared. As a consequence we will discuss some of the obstacles which limit comparison of the field and model data and suggest how some of these might be overcome.",

            "abstract": "Ocean waves change alongshore topographies and their effects reach to ecological systems and coastal infrastructures. Ocean waves are mainly formed by sea surface wind, then variations in sea surface winds can cause changes in ocean waves. Under the condition of global warming, atmospheric motion will change in future climate and they will give changes in wave climates. However, effects of global warming on wave climate have not yet investigated in detail. In this study, a dynamic downscaling method by a weather prediction model (WRF developed by NCAR) is applied to obtain detail information of sea surface wind in the present and future climates. The ocean wave is simulated by a wave model (WaveWatch-III developed by NOAA) with the downscaled wind in the present and future climate, then variations in wave climate in future are investigated. For future climate, climate projections in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) are used. For future scenario, the representative concentrate pathways 4.5 (RCP4.5) is selected. Variations of ocean waves in the Sea of Japan is focused in this work. Over the Sea of Japan, the strong northwesterly blows from the Eurasian Continent to the Japan islands in winter and causes high waves, and sometimes it causes marine accidents and breaks in coastal civil structures. The results of WaveWatch-III showed that the maximum value of significant wave height becomes smaller in the northern and central part of the Sea of Japan, however, clear increases are found in the southern part in future. In some regions, the maximum wave heights in future become 4 meter larger than in present. On the other hand, there are variations in frequency distribution of significant wave height. The frequency of modestly high waves increases and the low wave frequency decreases mainly in January and February (even in areas with smaller maximum significant wave height in future). Without extremely high ocean waves, variations in frequency distribution on ocean wave will affect alongshore sediment transport and topography.",

            "abstract": "Natural ammonia emissions are difficult to address because most measurement sites are influenced by nearby anthropogenic ammonia sources. Furthermore, measuring the net exchange of ammonia is challenging due to bi-directionality of the flux and the high reactivity of ammonia. In this study we present two months of half-hourly ammonia fluxes and concentrations measured above the remote forest site Morgan-Monroe State Forest (MMSF) in the central Midwest in USA. Measurements are conducted during the late summer and autumn 2013 using the Relaxed Eddy Accumulation Method with the purpose is to quantify the baseline concentration and exchange of ammonia in a natural forest ecosystem and to understand the controlling processes. Combined with additional ammonia studies for MMSF a seasonal baseline of the ammonia concentration above the forest of spring = 0.39±0.39, summer = 0.30±0.39, autumn = 0.20±0.26, and winter = 0.26±0.1 μg m-3 was concluded. The mean concentration of ammonia measured in this study was 0.23 μg m-3 but shorter periods with concentration higher than 1 μg m-3 were also seen. The fluxes were mainly upward (emission) of up to 0.11 μg m-2 s-1, however, when the atmospheric concentration was higher, downward fluxes (deposition) up to -0.07 μg m-2 s-1 occurred. Air mass back trajectories from the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model did not identify any specific source area causing the higher ammonia concentrations measured affirming that the atmospheric ammonia is surface controlled. The largest fluxes was found shortly after rain events indication that the humidity of the forest ecosystem in crucial in controlling both deposition and emission of atmospheric ammonia. Measurements of size resolved aerosol concentrations and nitric acid gas concentrations and fluxes indicated that gas-particle phase partitioning occurred and influenced the exchange of ammonia. At last, a clear diurnal pattern in the ammonia concentration and fluxes was observed. Higher concentrations during nighttime and lower concentrations during daytime were found to some extent to be related to the diurnal development of the atmospheric boundary layer.",

            "abstract": "To improve the knowledge of secular variation of the geomagnetic field in southwestern Europe, 38 lava flows were investigated in Tenerife and Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, Spain). One flow is an historical one (1706 AD) and 28 flows are dated by radiocarbon between 1550 AD and about 13200 BC. Nine other flows are not dated but they have stratigraphic links with the other flows. Thermomagnetic curves, unblocking temperatures and coercivities suggest that the main carrier of the remanent magnetization is titanomagnetite with various Titanium contents and in the pseudo-single domain range as an average grain size. Paleomagnetic directions were obtained by thermal demagnetization on more than 400 specimens and alternating field demagnetization on about 150 twin specimens. The original Thellier and Thellier method was applied for each of the 400 cores and, with PICRIT-03, allowed to determine absolute paleointensity values. Combined with the data previously published for the last 500 years, this new dataset is the first long PSV record available for the Canary Islands.\nComparison with model predictions indicates that, on the long-term, models account for most of the data but during short time intervals, more variable paleomagnetic directions and intensities suggest a faster variability of the earth magnetic field than predicted by the models. In particular, around 600 BC and 1200 BC, very high paleointensity values (~ 150 ZAm^2) are consistent with data obtained previously in Portugal, Azores, Hawaii and Israel. Also, around 4650 BC, variability in paleomagnetic directions could reflect short-term changes of the geomagnetic field.\nThese paleomagnetic results are consistent with the field derived stratigraphic position of the undated sites and confirm that the eruption rate of the Gran Canaria volcanic system was high around 600 BC, 1000 BC and 4650 BC.",

However, the absolute importance of this process for bulk seismicity within accretionary wedges undergoing severe shortening over millions of years has remained enigmatic. In this study, we infer the conditions of brittle rock failure throughout the formation and growth of the Paleogene accretionary wedge of the central European Alps. We find the predominance of disparate fracture modes within the outer and inner wedge. By combining our dataset with a dynamic Mohr-Coulomb wedge analysis, we show that the observed fracture patterns could only be formed under transient stress fields occurring during co- to postseismic times. We conclude that also over geological timescales wedge internal brittle deformation is linked to the subduction earthquake cycle and seismic hazard within the upper plate is highest following great megathrust earthquakes.",

The contribution of the atmosphere is one of the major error sources in repeat-pass InSAR in general. For time-series analysis spatial and temporal \u0007filtering \bof the interferometric phase can be used to address atmospheric signals. This however might be at the cost of smoothing and removal of the \u0007tectonic deformation\b. We applied a tropospheric correction to each interferogram based on estimates of the ERA-Interim weather model, provided by the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF). This approach is part of the InSAR Atmospheric Correction Toolbox (Bekaert et al, in prep) and converts the tropospheric water vapor content into the phase-delay of the radar line-of-sight. For the analysis we used 49 descending and 58 ascending Envisat SAR images, which cover the time period from 2003 until 2010. In addition, we have processed 30 SAR images of RADARSAT-2 for the period between 2010-2012. Furthermore, we used the different viewing geometries and the integration of GPS data to decompose the single line-of-sight velocities into a 3-dimensional field vector by applying the SISTEM approach (Guglielmino et al. 2011).\nFirst results reveal that the atmospherically corrected data retain the deformation signal along geological structures like the Scicli-Ragusa fault whilst the standard filtering approach is canceling out these very slow deformation patterns. Simultaneously, the variability of the signal in space is diminished and thus gives more confidence on the deformation patterns observed by the SAR. Consequently, the decomposition of the line-of-sight velocities and the integration with the GPS data allows us to retrieve a more realistic deformation field.",

            "abstract": "Over the past 150 years the Rhône River has been heavily altered by human infrastructures. The first wave (1860 - 1930) of modifications consisted of dikes and groynes designed to narrow the channel and promote incision in order to facilitate navigation. A second period (1948 - 1986) involved the construction of a series of canals and dams for hydroelectricity production. These works bypass multiple reaches of the original channel and drastically reduce the discharge and sediment load reaching them. A comprehensive study underway is aimed at describing the present-day morphology of the Rhone along its 512 km length from its source at Lake Geneva to its sink at the Mediterranean Sea and quantifying the role of management works in the evolution to its current state.\nGrainsize distributions and armour ratios were determined using a combination of Wolman counts on bars and in shallow channels and dredge samples collected from a boat in navigable reaches. Long profiles were constructed from historical bathymetric maps and bathymetric data collected between 1950 – 2010. Differential long profiles highlighting changes in bed elevation due to sediment storage and erosion were analyzed for three different periods: post-channelization, post-dam construction, and a recent period of major floods.\nResults show a complex discontinuous pattern in grainsize associated with hydraulic discontinuities imposed by dams. The D50 for bypass reaches is 45 mm compared to a D50 of 34 mm in the non-bypass reaches. The lower D50 as well as a finer tailed distribution in non-bypass reaches reflects fining associated with storage upstream of dams. Armour ratios are on average around 2 but are notably higher for reaches in the middle section of the Rhone.\nThe average incision rate was 1.8 cm/yr for the period of post-channelization and 1.2 cm/yr following dam construction, suggesting the post-dam Rhone was already partially armoured due to incision associated with channelization preceding dam construction. A period marked by large floods between 2001 – 2003 had an average incision rate of approximately 3 cm/yr. Changes in bed elevation for this period highlight destocking and restocking of fine sediments in reservoirs upstream of dams. Only a few downstream reaches where floods were most intense and grainsize is finer were truly active.",

            "abstract": "Climate change over the next century is expected to substantially alter Arctic ecosystem structure and function, resulting in important feedbacks to global climate. Representing Arctic landscapes in the carbon cycle and climate models, however, is challenging because vegetation and soils vary over small spatial scales. Robust approaches are needed for identifying distinct plant communities for fine-scale model parameterizations, and for mapping the distribution of these communities to enable scaling from plot to grid-cell.\nHere, we demonstrate how a novel technique using LiDAR-derived metrics to delineate micro-topographic features can also be applied to mapping plant community distribution in a polygonal tundra landscape on the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO), Alaska. We recorded species composition in 48, 1 x 1 m plots located across contrasting ice-wedge polygon types on the BEO in July 2012. One-way cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling identified four major plant communities, namely i) tall Carex (sedge) dominated communities, ii) mixed tall graminoid-forb-moss communities, iii) dry graminoid-lichen communities and iv) low-stature, lichen dominated-communities. These communities were strongly linked to micro-topography, corresponding with i) low centers ii) troughs, iii) rims and transitional polygon centers, and iv) high centers. We therefore combined plant community type with geomorphological analyses using high-resolution LiDAR-derived metrics (e.g. slope, curvature, flowpath distances) to delineate micro-topographic features to produce a vegetation map. The map was verified using 24 field survey transects in which plant community boundaries were mapped using DGPS. The approach performed well, with only a small (5%) over-estimate of the extent of trough communities and a corresponding under-estimate of rim and transitional center communities.\nOverall, these analyses provide a framework which can be used for parameterizing fine-scale ecosystem models of the tundra at Barrow, including the vital component of determining fractional coverage of vegetation communities within the broader landscape. Future work will include incorporating soil variables, and determining the extent to which soil and vegetation classifications are coupled.",

            "abstract": "Currently there are more than ~225 identified multiple asteroid systems (MASs). These systems exhibit a large diversity in physical and orbital characteristics indicating that multiple formation mechanisms are likely responsible for their formation. The hypothesized formation mechanisms, however, still require observational evidence for their testing and refinement. The critical piece of evidence required for this task is the internal structure, or porosity, of the MASs. In turn, the estimation of internal structure requires both the density of the MAS and the identification of an appropriate meteorite analog or mineral composition. With the aim to identify the mineralogy and meteorite analogs for MASs, we present the results of a visible and near infrared (NIR) reflectance spectral (0.45 – 2.45 µm) survey and analysis of 42 Main Belt MASs. The NIR reflectance spectra for S- and V-type asteroids contain two broad absorptions centered near 1- and 2-µm (Band I and II) due to olivine and pyroxene. Through a parameterization of these two bands coupled with laboratory measurements to serve as a calibration, it is possible to measure the mineralogy and identify meteorite analogs. Using a custom band parameter analysis code, the Spectral Analysis Routine for Asteroids (SARA), we perform an analysis of the S- and V-type MASs in our sample to determine the relative/modal abundances, as well as ordinary chondrite and HED meteorite analogs. Using the results of previous studies and presence/absence of the 0.7 µm absorption feature associated with CM chondrites, we also assign meteorite analogs for C-type MASs. Using the MAS density estimates from Marchis et al. (2012) and measured meteorite bulk and grain porosities from Consolmagno et al. (2008), we are able to estimate the porosity for 13 MASs. We find all porosities to be commensurate with the predications based upon the MAS formation hypotheses.",

Several recent researches suggest that East Asian stalagmites δ18O represents neither surface air temperature nor precipitation, but an integral variation of Asian monsoon circulation systems. It reflects a ratio of different water vapor sources. Since large-scale atmospheric-oceanic patterns such as Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) show significant effects on the Asian monsoon circulation systems, in this work we explored the relationships between these atmospheric-oceanic patterns and the East Asian stalagmites δ18O during the last three centuries by using several reconstructed dataets together with instrumental records. Considering the human activities exert extraordinary impacts on climate, we compared the two separated periods, before and after the industrial revolution. The results show significant lead-lag connections between the East Asian stalagmites δ18O and the large-scale atmospheric-oceanic patterns. One positive correlation peaks when PDO leads the East Asian stalagmites δ18O by 3 years. This PDO-stalagmite connection is robust through the whole recent centuries. In comparison, the relations between AMO, NAO and the East Asian stalagmites δ18O exhibit significant differences in the post-industrial period and the pre-industrial period. Thus, the East Asian stalagmites δ18O may be a reflector of the signals of PDO.",

Due to vast land reclamation along the Tarim River to grow cotton, native plant species are facing a severe competition for water, which is essential for their survival. Decreasing river runoff and inefficient water use practices by agriculture and industry has exacerbated already serious situation even worse. In addition, a large influx of migrant famers from Eastern China is being settled in this region to cultivate new agricultural lands that consumed even more water. Under those conditions, the natural riparian vegetation and the irrigation agriculture, especially along the lower reaches, suffers water shortage leading the degradation and economic losses, respectively. Along with the enlargement of irrigation area and periods of water shortage, soil salinization has become a major concern for farmers in the area.\nAlternative cash crops are much needed to reduce water use, so both native vegetation and human demand for water would be fulfilled. We hypothesized Apocynum Pictum, perennial herb species with multiple uses as potential substitute. Multidisciplinary approach is being used in this study to investigate three related issues to offer a basis for Apocynum’s role in sustainable agriculture, such as Biomass production of Apocynum; Water budget of Apocynum; and Economic utilization of Apocynum. A.Pictum is perennial plant distributed in Central Asia and China, which its roots are perennial, while the stems die every year. Thus, A.pictum grow under the arid climate of Central Asia and provide utilization options without irrigation. We initially estimate water requirement for this plant is much less than cotton. In order to validate our hypothesis, we have measured water consumption of the plant. Mean while, leaves of A.pictum can be used to produce tea and stems can be used to produce fiber. It could compensate farmer’s loss from potential land use switch. Finally we believe that A.pctum offers viable alternative to reduce water demand and ensure long-term sustainability of oasis along the Tarim River.",

Second, group and phase velocities are measured for 3-30 second using ambient noise data from 30 broadband stations. Lastly, phase velocity dispersions of teleseismic data are measured for longer periods (~20-100 s) using the two-station method. We check the reliability of the dispersion measurements by comparisons between the results of different datasets within overlapping wave periods. To construct a three-dimensional model, a series of one-dimensional inversion is performed using the dispersion data extracted from tomographic dispersion maps. We use a recently developed method of the Bayesian inversion, in which S-wave velocity and thickness of each layer are searched. The obtained three-dimensional S-wave velocity model shows that the variation of velocity agrees with the major tectonic regions at shallow depths (< 5 km). In the middle crust, high velocity anomaly is found in the southeastern part of the Peninsula where the particularly low velocity is estimated at the shallow depths. At around Moho depth, the pattern of velocity variation indicates isostatic equilibrium of the Korean Peninsula. In the uppermantle, low velocity anomaly is imaged along the eastern margin of the Peninsula. The estimated model provides evidence of that the Korean Peninsular is generally homogeneous but locally modified, particularly in the southeastern part.",

            "abstract": "For a sound monitoring of the global distribution of atmospheric CO2 concentrations and their sources and sinks and the improvement of our ability to model those, precise measurements of atmospheric CO2 concentrations with global coverage and high spatial and temporal resolution are needed. The new NASA OCO-2 satellite, launched in July 2014, offers the capability to meet these needs. However, for the uptake of the OCO-2 data products by the science community, a profound analysis of the data quality and robust knowledge of the occurring retrieval errors is required.\nTherefore, the RemoTeC algorithm, previously applied for the retrieval of column-averaged dry air mole fractions of carbon dioxide (XCO2) from measurements by the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT), is adapted to enable the retrieval of XCO2 from OCO-2 measurements. As the OCO-2 measurements are sensitive for the polarization of the reflected sunlight, the algorithm is expanded for polarization sensitive measurements by making use of a vector radiative transfer model. Furthermore, the algorithm is adjusted to deal with OCO-2 instrument specific aspects, such as data format and instrumental line shape. We compare the results with the OCO-2 Level 2 data product. Here, we report on first results.",

            "abstract": "NUVEM (New methods to Use gnss water Vapor Estimates for Meteorology of Portugal) is a collaborative project funded by the Portuguese National Science Foundation (FCT) aiming to implement a multi-disciplinary approach in order to operationalize the inclusion of GNSS-PWV estimates for nowcasting in Portugal, namely for the preparation of warnings of severe weather. To achieve such goal, the NUVEM project is divided in two major components:\na) Development and implementation of methods to compute accurate estimates of PWV (Precipitable Water Vapor) in NRT (Near Real-Time);\nb) Integration of such estimates in nowcasting procedures in use at IPMA (Portuguese Meteorological Service).\nMethodologies will be optimized at SEGAL to passive and actively access to the data; the PWV estimations will be computed using PPP (Precise Point Positioning), which permits the estimation of each individual station separately; solutions will be validated using internal and external values; and computed solutions will be transferred timely to the IPMA Operational Center.\nValidation of derived estimations using robust statistics is an important component of the project. The need for sending computed values as soon as possible to IPMA requires fast but reliable internal (e.g., noise estimation) and external (e.g., feedback from IPMA using other sensors like radiosondes) assessment of the quality of the PWV estimates.\nAt IPMA, the goal is to implement the operational use of GNSS-PWV to assist weather nowcasting in Portugal. This will be done with the assistance of the Meteo group of IDL. Maps of GNSS-PWV will be automatically created and compared with solutions provided by other operational systems in order to help IPMA to detect suspicious patterns at near real time. This will be the first step towards the assimilation of GNSS-PWV estimates at IPMA nowcasting models.\nThe NUVEM (EXPL/GEO-MET/0413/2013) project will also contribute to the active participation of Portugal at the COST Action ES1206 - Advanced Global Navigation Satellite Systems tropospheric products for monitoring severe weather events and climate (GNSS4SWEC).\nThis work is also carried out in the framework of the Portuguese Project SMOG (PTDC/CTE-ATM/119922/2010).",

            "abstract": "The climate of the last glaciation was interrupted by numerous abrupt millennial scale temperature fluctuations between cold stadials and warm interstadials, the so-called Greenland Dansgaard-Oeschger events. During the warm interstadials the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) was active and warm water flowed north into the Nordic seas. During the cold stadials the northern oceans were partially ice covered and the AMOC disrupted. So far, very little is known of changes in the surrounding ice sheets and in the discharge of meltwater in response to abrupt warmings even though variation in meltwater production is regarded to be a major factor in the instability. Here we present results from sediment cores from the western slope of Svalbard in order to reconstruct the delivery of sediments and meltwater from the archipelago as in response to stadial/interstadial shifts during MIS 3. During interstadials the normal greenish silt was replaced by laminated, pink clay originating from Devonian Red Beds on Svalbard and transported in suspension by meltwater to the coring site. The large distance from the ice margin to the site indicates the outpourings of meltwater were substantial, probably comparable to some of the largest outbursts during the deglaciation. The concentration of ice rafted debris decreased as the meltwater production increased signifying that the ice margin retreated from the coastal area. In the study, we establish the precise chronology for eight major meltwater discharges during MIS 3 corresponding to Dansgaard-Oeschger warmings DO-11 to DO-3. The results are based on the Svalbard-Barents Sea ice sheet, but it is likely that the Scandinavian ice sheet reacted concurrently. Our observations indicate that the Eurasian ice sheet was much more dynamic than previously recognized with retreat and advances closely linked to the Greenland interstadials and stadials .Our findings also provide clear evidence of a significant northern component to the rapid global sea-level changes that several lines of evidence suggest occurred during MIS 3. The results also show that the Dansgaard-Oeschger events strongly affected the water exchange in the Fram Strait between the Nordic seas and the Arctic Ocean.",

            "abstract": "The boundary between the Caribbean plate and the North American plate is transpressive due to the oblique collision between these two plates. The transpressive movement is partitioned and accommodated in the Hispaniola region along two left-lateral strike-slip structures surrounding a fold-and-thrust belt. New multibeam bathymetry data and multichannel seismic reflection profiles have been recently collected during the Haiti-SIS and Haiti-SIS 2 cruises, along part of the northern Caribbean plate boundary between Cuba, Jamaica and Hispaniola. From the north to the south, three types of deformations are observed. In the Windward Passage, the analysis of the data set reveals that the movement on the Oriente fault between Cuba and Hispaniola is purely left-lateral strike-slip according to the GPS measurements. In the Gonave basin, west of Hispaniola, the deformation is compressive. A series of folds is identified and moves toward the southwest. The Enriquillo-Plantain-Garden Fault (EPGF) is localized in the Jamaica Passage, between Jamaica and Hispaniola. The analysis of the data set reveals that the left-lateral EPGF recently intersects inherited basins from the eastern Cayman Trough margin. The study of the actual EPGF active trace shows that this fault moves with a pure strike-slip component, at least in its western part: the presence of a little push-up structure and a set of three en echelon folds is highlighting in the western part of the Jamaica Passage. The shortening rate in the inherited basins crossed by the EPGF increases from west to east (5.8% to 8.5%), indicating that a thrusting component is also accommodated around the EPGF.",

            "abstract": "East and Southeast Asia and Western Pacific have extreme topography and both the youngest and oldest oceanic basins in the world, and are ideal places to understand oceanic basin evolution and continent-ocean interactions. Crustal structure is critical to understand the regional geodynamic processes. We present our recent inversion of Moho depths of East/Southeast Asia and Western Pacific from satellite gravity data. Because the marginal basins have experienced different cooling histories, we perform thermal correction after the simple Bouguer correction based on the plate cooling model. The model parameters are tested by varying the input plate thickness and mantle temperature with 5 km and 50°C steps, respectively. The evaluation criteria of thermal correction is that the regions with similar water depths have similar Moho depths. We find the best-fit plate thickness and mantle temperature are 95 km and 1300°C, respectively. The Moho undulations are then estimated from residual Bouguer gravity based on the Parker-Oldenburg algorithm. Because the study area convers distinct geological settings, we implement two gravity inversion strategies. In the first strategy, we use a constant density contrast of 0.38 g/cm3 across the Moho and a reference depth of 25 km for the entire study area. Using just one density contrast results in an obvious shallow Moho in continental region. In the second strategy, the study area is divided into four blocks, each covering either the continents or oceans mainly. Moho depths range approximately between 5 and 65 km. The average Moho depths of continental and continental shelf domains are about 35 and 23 km, respectively. Moho depths beneath the marginal basins are averaged at about 16 km. This large mean Moho depth is attributed to numerous seamounts, volcanic chains and ridges, where the Moho depths can be up to ~35 km. We find that the density contrast across the Moho varies between 0.33 and 0.40 g/cm3, approximately 0.40 g/cm3 in most continental domains and between 0.33 and 0.37 g/cm3 in oceanic domains.",

In particular we study the behavior of a fluid-saturated fault under shear, based on the assumption that the fabric presents rate- and temperature dependent response to shear loading. A creeping fault of this type can, under certain conditions, produce excess heat due to shear heating, reaching temperatures which are high enough for triggering endothermic chemical reactions. We focus on the decomposition reactions and incorporate excess pore pressure generation and variations of the porosity due to the chemical effects (a process called chemical pressurization). After deriving the corresponding system of equations in the region of the ultra-cataclastic core, we study the influence of the model parameters, namely the frictional, hydraulic and chemical properties of the material, along with the boundary conditions of the problem, on the behavior of the fault and through a non-linear bifurcation analysis we provide regimes of stable-frictional sliding and pressurization. Furthermore, the system is integrated in time to extract its temporal behavior, providing regimes of stable creep, non-periodic and periodic seismic slip events due to chemical pressurization, depending on their frictional properties. It is shown that this chemically induced seismic slip is an ultra-localized event in the post failure regime. It takes place in an extremely narrow band, 2 orders of magnitude narrower than the initial one, verifying the field observations.",

            "abstract": "An adequate quantification of groundwater recharge is required for sustainable water resource management and robust hydrological model predictions. However, estimation of the future temporal evolution of groundwater recharge rates at annual, seasonal or daily time scales remains a challenging task due to the strong linkage of infiltration processes with predicted changes of the frequency distribution of precipitation. While many studies have addressed recharge processes under climate change scenarios, only limited work has been carried out systematically focusing on the impact of precipitation variability.\nThus, we simulated groundwater recharge in the Swiss pre-Alpine Rietholzbach research catchment based on a water balance model, that was calibrated to daily direct recharge measured at a weighting lysimeter. Three approaches, employing different degrees of complexity, were utilized to obtain future climatic forcing functions. First, a relatively simple delta change factors approach for three stationary time periods was applied. For this scenario 10 different climate model chains were used to determine the predictive uncertainty accompanied with the different GCM (Global Circulation Model) x RCM (Regional Climate Model) combinations. Second, these delta change values were combined with a stochastic weather generator, which allows for a more realistic simulation of climatic variability compared to the simple delta change downscaling approach. Further, additional uncertainty, linked to natural climate variability in the climatic forcing functions, can be determined more efficiently. Finally, the frequency distribution of precipitation events was artificially adjusted to account for a larger amount of extreme events, thus simulating what is expected for the future.\nThe first simulations indicate that annual recharge is less affected by changes of the frequency distribution of precipitation, however there was a marked impact on the seasonal signal. All approaches demonstrated that the uncertainty of projected recharge rates were relatively large. Preliminary results of the third modeling approach indicate that the impact of extreme precipitation events seems to be underestimated in many climate change impact studies.",

            "abstract": "In many coastal regions around the world climate change will lead to a sea level rise and an increase in extreme weather conditions. This prospect has resulted in a new focus on coastal protection in the Netherlands, resulting in the initiation of an innovative coastal defence project called the Sand Motor. In this project a large body of sand or so-called mega-nourishment has been constructed along the Dutch coast. This body of sand will be distributed slowly along the coastline by wind, waves and currents. Keeping the coastal defence structures in place and creating a unique, dynamic environment with changing morphology over time. Because of the large size of the body of sand (21.5 million m3) and the position at the coastline and near coastal dunes, the Sand Motor might cause a substantial increase of the fresh water availability by increasing the volume fresh water lens underneath the dunes. This creates an opportunity to combine coastal protection with an increase of fresh water resources in coastal regions. With a three dimensional, density dependent, groundwater model the effects of changing morphology over time and the potential increase in fresh water availability have been studied.",

            "abstract": "Using palaeocology and in particular palaeoentomology to understand climate, environmental change and impacts by indigenous groups in the North Atlantic Arctic fringe provides the opportunity to obtain refined details about both the rates of impact and the timing of the change from hunting and gathering to farming. In northern Norway and Sweden the Sami coastal fisher-hunters and inland reindeer herders shared the landscape with incoming agriculturalists and were often assimilated or marginalised. While inside their settled areas there is a palaeoentomological record for the Sami and often information about resource use and seasonality is evident from the fossil insect record, their footprint on the wider landscape tends to be slight and difficult to discern. The diverse and often intermittent nature of Sami activities, which may range from reindeer herding, fishing and even some agricultural activities, makes the task of firmly identifying impacts and differentiating these from climate change a complex task. On the other hand, the transition from a diverse subsistence to intensified pastoralism leaves a clear record in the fossil insect assemblages, both from midden deposits and natural profiles. To add to the complexities of the interpretation, farmers in northern Norway for example, were actively involved in fishing and the fur trade, and introduced grain faunas found in the farm mounds attest to the returns on this, but there is no way to be certain whether the occupiers of the farms were Sami or Norse, or a mixture of both. For a group where both archaeological and historical evidence is sparse, the insect record may unfold the poorly known ecological impact of the Sami.\n  ",

            "abstract": "In the last decades, Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) has been proven to be one of the most valuable techniques to improve our understanding of the Earth's shape, gravity field and rotational motion. Apart from the ''traditional'' tasks of SLR, in the recent past the portfolio has been considerably widened. Especially the SLR-based orbit determination and orbit prediction of space debris objects is gaining increasing attention. The reliable and accurate orbit determination/prediction of debris objects is of crucial importance for any effort towards debris collision avoidance. Hitherto, this task is performed by space surveillance networks using ground-based radar tracking and passive optical tracking with telescopes. These methods, however, are characterized by low accuracy, ranging from several hundreds of meters to a few kilometers for low-Earth orbiting objects. As demonstrated successfully, SLR has the potential to considerably improve these numbers, and hence to improve debris surveillance.\nOne of the most severe limitations of the technique is the sparse network of SLR stations, and hence the sparseness of tracking data. Against this background, we propose to extend the existing SLR network by passive telescopes in combination with multi-static observations. Multi-static observations means that an object is tracked by only one active SLR station, but the diffusely reflected photons are detected at several passive stations (in case of only one passive station the measurements are referred to as bi-static). In order to demonstrate the performance of the principle, we analyzed (i) two-way laser ranges from Graz (3 passes), and (ii) two-way laser ranges from Graz (3 passes) in combination with bi-static measurements between the SLR stations Graz and Wettzell (3 passes); our investigations focus on the defunct ENVISAT satellite. We found the orbit determination/prediction results including bi-static observations to outperform single-station results by about one order of magnitude. For scenario (ii), our orbit prediction error ranges from 40m (prediction age 1 day) to 450m (prediction age 7 days). From our first experiments we conclude that bi-/multi-static SLR is capable to meet the requirements for debris surveillance, but might also be beneficial for more ''traditional'' applications.",

Koklass Pheasant (Pucrasia macrolopha) species is distributed from Afghanistan and Pakistan in the east along the Himalayas to southeastern Tibet, western China and southeastern Mongolia.This species is grouped under endangered species in Red Data Book of Zoological Survey of India and also classified as least concern species according to IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.Conservation biologists and managers need a range of both classical analyses and specific modern tools to face the increasing threats to biodiversity. Among these tools, habitat-suitability modeling has recently emerged as a relevant technique to assess global impacts to define wide conservation priorities.The present study is carried out using remote sensing satellite imagery and GIS modeling technique for assessing habitat suitability of Koklass Pheasants and finding out the habitat factors influencing the Koklass distribution in Churdhar Wildlife Sanctuary, India. Effective management and conservation of wildlife populations and their habitats largely depend on our ability to understand and predict species-habitat interactions. Different thematic maps viz., land use/cover, forest types, drainage buffer, multiple ring buffers of sighting locations and multiple ring buffers of roads have been prepared to support the objective of the study. The Weighted Overlay Analysis model is used for identifying different potential areas of habitat for this endangered species. The most suitable area for Koklass Pheasant within the Wildlife Sanctuary is found to be about 23.8 percent of the total area which is due to favourable habitat conditions for the survival of the species. The moderately high, moderate and least suitable areas come about 45.4, 24.9 and 5.9 percent, respectively. Identification of habitat potential areas for Koklass Pheasant species could be considered as one of the most important steps towards the conservation and management.",

            "abstract": "Observations of volcanically induced seismicity are essential for eruption forecasting and for real-time and near-real-time warnings of hazardous volcanic activity. Studies of volcanic seismicity and of seismic wave propagation also provide critical understanding of subsurface magmatic systems and the physical processes associated with magma genesis, transport, and eruption. However, desipite significant advances in recent years, our ability to successfully forecast volcanic eruptions and fully understand subsurface volcanic processes is limited by our current understanding of the source processes of volcano-seismic events, the effects on seismic wave propagation within volcanic structures, limited data, and even the non-standardized terminology used to describe seismic waveforms. Progress in volcano seismology is further hampered by inconsistent data formats and standards, lack of state-of-the-art hardware and professional technical staff, as well as a lack of widely adopted analysis techniques and software. Addressing these challenges will not only advance scientific understanding of volcanoes, but also will lead to more accurate forecasts and warnings of hazardous volcanic eruptions that would ultimately save lives and property world-wide. Two recent workshops held in Anchorage, Alaska, and Oxford, UK, represent important steps towards developing a relationship among members of the academic community and government agencies, focused around a shared, long-term vision for volcano seismology. Recommendations arising from the two workshops fall into six categories: 1) Ongoing and enhanced community-wide discussions, 2) data and code curation and dissemination, 3) code development, 4) development of resources for more comprehensive data mining, 5) enhanced strategic seismic data collection, and 6) enhanced integration of multiple datasets (including seismicity) to understand all states of volcano activity through space and time. As presented sequentially above, these steps can be regarded as a road map for galvanizing and strengthening the volcano seismological community to drive new scientific and technical progress over the next 5-10 years.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that rainfall during the East African Long Rains season has declined over recent decades, whereas the majority of climate models predict an increase due to anthropogenic carbon emissions. This raises questions about either the reliability of the model projections, or when we might expect this drought to turn to more abundant rainfall and perhaps more frequent flooding.\nWe first list all hypotheses that may conceivably explain this paradox, our aim being to include all possibilities regardless of preconceptions as to their likelihood:\n• A: The recent observed trend is due to poor quality data.\n• B: The projected trend arises from poor modelling of key processes.\n• C: Trends are due to natural variability.\n• D: The balance between competing forcings is changing, with the past trend driven by aerosol emissions and the future trend driven by carbon emissions.\n• E: The past trend has been driven by land-use changes.\n• F: The mechanistic response to CO2 emissions is non-linear.\n• Some combination of the above.\nRegarding A, there is good observational evidence for a recent downward trend in rainfall. Regarding B, careful and substantial further research is essential to confidently refute or accept this idea.\nThe possibility that the observed trend is due to natural variability (C) is assessed using two approaches. Both suggest that the recent Long Rains droughts are either due to a very unusual natural event of the climate system, or (more likely) are at least partly due to anthropogenic forcing. Hypothesis D, that the recent observed rainfall trend may be due to anthropogenic aerosol emissions, eg. from Asia, is investigated using CMIP5 sensitivity experiments. These reveal a significant, but highly model-dependent, impact on SST trends over the Indian and Pacific Oceans, which are thought to have caused the recent Long Rains droughts. Other CMIP5 experiments suggest that land-use changes are unlikely to have caused the recent droughts, and that the response to CO2 forcing over East Africa is not substantially non-linear (Hypotheses E and F).\nFurther work should therefore focus on improving the modelling of aerosol impacts on regional rainfall changes and on providing a well-considered ‘expert judgement’ of the reliability of the model’s projections for the coming century.",

On the other hand, using nine borehole strainmeters of Geological Survey of Japan, AIST, we estimated a fault model with Mw 8.7 for the earthquake on the boundary between the Pacific and North American plates. This model can be estimated about seven minutes after the origin time, and five minute after wave arrival.\nIn order to grasp the magnitude of a great earthquake earlier, several methods are now being suggested to reduce the earthquake disasters including tsunami (e.g., Ohta et al., 2012).

            "abstract": "Water discharge and suspension load of a river are potentially recorded in sediments in the drainage and / or the river mouth, which could provide us useful proxies for paleoclimatic study. Sediment load from the Yangtze River to the East China Sea (ECS) from the delta to the Okinawa Trough have been widely used to reconstruct the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) in the past since the water discharge from the Yangtze would be highly affected by monsoon rain, which could deliver much fresh water and sediment to the ECS. Theoretically, sediment provenance and its yield could be changed from time to time depending on the distribution of precipitation which would control the balance of water discharges from the tributaries. Therefore, we need to know the sediment budget along the Yangtze main stream with regards to the inputs from its major tributaries in order to understand the potential effects from the change in the distribution of the EASM precipitation. For this purpose, we have conducted a systematic sampling of the Yangtze River water to determine the concentration and mineral composition of suspension loads during summer in 2011 and winter in 2012. Water samples were taken at main junctions of the major tributaries. The mineral composition of suspended material were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses as well as amount of suspended solids (SS: mg/L) . Abundances of clay minerals relative to quartz tend to decrease from upstream to downstream, while feldspars and calcite increases downstream. Since clay minerals are generally finer than feldspars and calcite, it is suggested that the relatively coarse minerals were removed due to the grain size fractionation during transportation of the suspended particles. Mineral composition in winter is overridden by higher suspension load from upper to middle reaches in summer, which is characterized by higher plagioclase / K-feldspar, higher calcite and dolomite, and wider half-height widths of smectite and illite in summer. Kaolinite is only dominant in the southeastern drainage. These features enable us to distinguish suspended materials from the upper reaches from those from the lower reaches, which could be useful to estimate the dominant area of high precipitation and erosion within the large Yangtze drainage.",

            "abstract": "Saharan dust falls are frequently observed in the Alpine region and are easily recognized by the unique yellowish coloration of the snow surface. Such Saharan dust events contribute to a large part to the total mineral dust deposited in snow and impact the surface energy budget by reducing the snow and ice albedo. In this study we investigate the long-term effect of such Saharan dust events on the surface albedo and the glacier's mass balance. The analysis is performed over the period 1914-2013 for two field sites on Claridenfirn, Swiss Alps, where an outstanding 100-year record of seasonal mass balance measurements is available. Based on the detailed knowledge about the mass balance, annual melt and accumulation rates are derived. A firn/ice core drilled at the glacier saddle of Colle Gnifetti (Swiss Alps) provides information on the impurity concentration in precipitation over the last century. A mass balance model combined with a parameterization for snow and ice albedo based on the specific surface area of snow and the snow impurity concentration is employed to assess the dust-albedo feedback. In order to track the position and thickness of snow layers a snow density model is implemented. Atmospheric dust enters the system of snow layers by precipitation and remains in the corresponding layer as long as there is no melt. When melt occurs, the water-insoluble part of the dust of the melted snow is supposed to accumulate in the top surface layer. The upper site has experienced only positive net mass balance and dust layers are continuously buried so that the impact of strong Saharan dust events is mainly restricted to the corresponding year. In the case of the lower site, the surface albedo is more strongly influenced by dust events of previous years due to periods with negative mass balances. Model results suggest that the enhanced melting in the 1940s yield even higher dust concentrations in 1947 compared to years with exceptional high Saharan dust deposition due to the accumulation of dust at the surface as the corresponding site migrates from accumulation to ablation area.",

            "abstract": "The Radiative Forcing Model Intercomparison Project (RFMIP): Assessment and characterization of forcing to enable feedback studies\nAn enormous amount of attention has been paid to the diversity of responses in the CMIP and other multi-model ensembles. This diversity is normally interpreted as a distribution in climate sensitivity driven by some distribution of feedback mechanisms. Identification of these feedbacks relies on precise identification of the forcing to which each model is subject, including distinguishing true error from model diversity.\nThe Radiative Forcing Model Intercomparison Project (RFMIP) aims to disentangle the role of forcing from model sensitivity as determinants of varying climate model response by carefully characterizing the radiative forcing to which such models are subject and by coordinating experiments in which it is specified. RFMIP consists of four activities:\n1) An assessment of accuracy in flux and forcing calculations for greenhouse gases under past, present, and future climates, using off-line radiative transfer calculations in specified atmospheres with climate model parameterizations and reference models\n2) Characterization and assessment of model-specific historical forcing by anthropogenic aerosols, based on coordinated diagnostic output from climate models and off-line radiative transfer calculations with reference models\n3) Characterization of model-specific effective radiative forcing, including contributions of model climatology and rapid adjustments, using coordinated climate model integrations and off-line radiative transfer calculations with a single fast model\n4) Assessment of climate model response to precisely-characterized radiative forcing over the historical record, including efforts to infer true historical forcing from patterns of response, by direct specification of non-greenhouse-gas forcing in a series of coordinated climate model integrations\nThis talk discusses the rationale for RFMIP, provides an overview of the four activities, and presents preliminary motivating results.",

            "abstract": "We compare the forecasting performance of several statistical models, which are used to describe the occurrence process of earthquakes, in forecasting the short-term earthquake probabilities during the occurrence of the L’Aquila earthquake sequence in central Italy, 2009. These models include the Proximity to Past Earthquakes (PPE) model and different versions of the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model. We used the information gains corresponding to the Poisson and binomial scores to evaluate the performance of these models. It is shown that all ETAS models work better than the PPE model. However, when comparing the different types of the ETAS models, the one with the same fixed exponent coefficient α = 2.3 for both the productivity function and the scaling factor in the spatial response function, performs better in forecasting the active aftershock sequence than the other models with different exponent coefficients when the Poisson score is adopted. These latter models perform only better when a lower magnitude threshold of 2.0 and the binomial score are used. The reason is likely due to the fact that the catalog does not contain an event of magnitude similar to the L’Aquila main shock (Mw 6.3) in the training period (April 16, 2005 to March 15, 2009). In this case the a-value is under-estimated and thus also the forecasted seismicity is underestimated when the productivity function is extrapolated to high magnitudes.\nThese results suggest that the training catalog used for estimating the model parameters should include earthquakes of similar magnitudes as the main shock when forecasting seismicity is during an aftershock sequences.",

            "abstract": "Monin-Obukhov similarity theory was initially developed for atmospheric boundary layer flows over flat and statistically homogeneous terrain, and verified with flux and profile measurements over such terrain. Even though ‘flat and statistically homogeneous terrain’ implies a very strict classification for real terrain to satisfy, Monin-Obukhov similarity theory has been shown to hold for a variety of flow situations outside of the narrow terrain categorizations of flows initially proposed. Furthermore, through the use of extended stability functions, it has been shown to hold even for specialized events in the stable boundary layer such as nonbreaking internal gravity waves and low-level jet formation over relatively flat terrain. The fact that it typically works, is one reason why Monin-Obukhov similarity scaling is so widely used in meteorological and hydrological modeling for real terrain, even when theoretically it should break down. Another reason why it is so widely used (potentially when it is inappropriate) is due to a lack of alternative, or more accurate, methodologies to relate the land surface forcing (boundary conditions) to the atmosphere in models. One such example for which Monin-Obukhov similarity theory has been shown to breakdown is steep slope flows. These steep slope flows are characterized by a very shallow jet layer, over which the fluxes vary by more than 10%, and the traditional ‘constant-flux’ surface layer is not observed. However, thermally driven slope flows exhibit a jet-like velocity profile. This suggests a ‘universal’ functionality, which could be revealed with the proper similarity scaling. The current work seeks to evaluate the validity of Monin-Obukhov similarity theory, with and without the extended stability functions and more recent similarity theories, proposed specifically for steep slope flows, using field data taken over a steep (35.5°) slope in Val Ferret, Switzerland. In addition, alternative, empirically driven, flux-gradient relationships are proposed and evaluated using the field data. The scalings associated with these relationships imply that they may be transferrable to other slope sites, and therefore may be used in place of traditional similarity theories.",

            "abstract": "Geochemical investigations on paleotsunami deposits have mainly focused on inorganic proxies. Organic geochemistry has been used to distinguish between terrestrial and marine matter within the sediments, reflecting the mixture and transport of marine and terrestrial matter. The approach using organic substances with indicative properties (anthropogenic and xenobiotic compounds) for recent tsunami deposits is novel, but the approach of using specific bio- and anthropogenic markers indicators to determine (pre)historic and recent processes and impacts already exists.\nThe Tohoku-oki tsunami in March 2011 showed the huge threat that tsunamis pose to society and landscape, including flooding of coastal lowlands and erosion/deposition of sediments. The mainly sandy tsunamites reach more than 4.5 km inland as there were run-up heights of ca. 10 m in the Sendai plain near the Sendai airport. The destruction of infrastructure by wave action and flooding was accompanied by the release of environmental pollutants (e.g. fuels, fats, tarmac, plastics, heavy metals, etc.) contaminating the coastal areas and ocean over large areas. To detect and characterize this process, we analyzed several sedimentary archives from the Bay of Sendai area (by using the same sample material as Szczucinski et al., 2012 from rice paddies of the Sendai Plain, Japan). The layers representing the tsunami deposits have been compared with pre-tsunami samples (supposedly to be unaffected) by means of organic-geochemical analyses based on GC/MS.\nNatural compounds and their diagenetic transformation products have been tested as marker compounds and proxies. The relative composition of fatty acids, n-alkanes, sesquiterpenes and further substances pointed to significant variations before and after the tsunami event. Additionally, anthropogenic marker compounds (such as soil derived pesticides, source specific PAHs, halogenated aromatics from industrial sources) have been detected and quantified. Concentration profiles of distinct terrestrial pollutants revealed shifts either to increasing but for selected compounds also to decreasing contamination levels. We will extend and test the approach in future on paleotsunami deposits of the 869 AD Jogan event and others.\nSzczucinski et al. 2012, Sed. Geol., 282:40-56.",

            "abstract": "In the last decade, temporal variations of the gravity field from GRACE inter-satellite observations have become one of the most ubiquitous and valuable sources of information for environmental studies. In order to bridge the likely gap between the present GRACE and the upcoming GRACE follow-on projects, we investigate the potential of gravity field information derived from orbit analysis for surface mass variation detection. The Swarm mission - launched on November 22, 2013 - is the most promising candidate to directly acquire large-scale mass variation information on the Earth's surface in the absence of GRACE. Although the magnetometry mission Swarm has not been designed for gravity field purposes, its three satellites have the appropriate orbit characteristics for such an endeavour. Hence, from an orbit analysis point of view the Swarm satellites are comparable to the CHAMP, GRACE and GOCE spacecraft.\nIn a first study, we assess the stand-alone capability of the Swarm mission for mass variation detection in a real-case environment. For this purpose, we ''approximate'' the Swarm scenario by the GRACE+CHAMP constellation. In a second study, we incorporate tracking observations from a series of additional satellites (e.g., GOCE, MetOp, TanDEM-X, Swarm) and extend the length of the time series according to data availability. We will demonstrate to what extent these measures improve the inference of time-variable features from orbit information. For both studies, in the first step, kinematic orbits of the individual satellites are derived from GPS observations. From these orbits, we compute monthly combined time-variable gravity fields. Finally, we infer mass variation in selected areas from the gravity signal. These results are compared to the findings obtained from mass variation detection exploiting CSR-RL05 gravity fields (the latter serve as ''benchmark solutions'').",

            "abstract": "The effect of Earth tides on earthquake timings has been widely investigated for many years. However, the evidence of tidally triggered seismicity is often variable and inconclusive. Tidal modulation of earthquake timings is based on the assumption that a critically-stressed seismic fault can be tidally activated only if tidal stresses are oriented along the faults natural slipping direction and therefore, enhance an existing tectonic stress. In this situation, the accuracy of tidal calculations is essential and depends greatly on the quality of earthquake focal mechanism solutions. The focal parameters provide necessary information about the geometry and kinematics of the fault. At the same time, they can be sensitive to numerous factors (e.g. the accuracy of the earthquake location, distribution of seismic stations, assumed velocity model) and thus, the fault-plane orientation and slip direction will always carry some degree of uncertainty. In this project, we conduct a sensitivity test to see how the orientation variability of the fault planes can affect the statistical significance of results on tidally-induced seismicity. We use a Monte Carlo simulation to generate a number of synthetic catalogues with the same properties as the original catalog. However, fault plane parameters of the synthetic catalogs are randomly drawn from the bounded range of uncertainties associated with an earthquake focal mechanism solution. The significance of correlation between Earth tides and earthquake occurrence is then evaluated separately for each catalog using the Shuster test. Firstly, we assign the tidal phase angle at the earthquake occurrence time. The phase angle is measured from the time series of the tidal stress calculated at the location of each event. The value is assigned by linearly dividing the time interval from 0° to 180° or from 180° to 0°, where 0° and ±180° corresponds to the maximum and the minimum of the tidal stress immediately before or after each earthquake respectively. After determining the phase angles for all the earthquakes in a data set, we statistically test whether they concentrate near some particular angle. A comparison of the original and synthetic catalogs is conducted for different qualities of focal mechanisms to identify any significant variation.",

            "abstract": "The increase of atmospheric greenhouse gases has caused noticeable climate change. The increased temperature by climate change could dramatically change in the decomposition rate and greater losses of carbon from soil organic matter. Decomposition of organic carbon regulates both the amount of organic material which is stored in soils, as well as the amount of mineralized carbon that can be released into the atmosphere as greenhouse gases (CO2 and CH4). In addition, the largest increase in the N-deposition was expected in Asia due to the dramatic increase in anthropogenic activities. Previous results from N-deposition experiments led to apparently contradictory hypotheses regarding the decomposition of organic carbon in soil. N-deposition has been found to decrease the decomposition of chemically complex carbon compounds, while increasing decomposition rates of labile carbon pools. Combined changes in temperature increase and N-deposition have considerable potential to affect soil carbon sequestration/loss and soil nutrient cycling. This study investigated how the combined changes of temperature increase and N-deposition influence mineralization processes and C dynamics of two soil systems (wetlands and forest). For this objective, we conducted a growth chamber experiment to examine the effects of combined changes in temperature increase and N-deposition on the decomposition of organic carbon and emission of greenhouse gases from two different soil systems. The samples were collected in wetland and forest around Gyeongan stream of South Korea. Incubator experiment was conducted under the enhanced air temperature (controlled 20 ℃, 25 ℃ and 30 ℃) and nitrogen addition (low and high condition by using ammonium nitrate). GHGs (CO2, N2O, and CH4) were measured gas chromatograph. Results of experiment show that CO2 flux decrease with time at forest soil and increase at wetland. Moreover high temperature (25 ℃, 30 ℃) and high concentration of nitrogen cause emission more than 20 ℃. As time goes on, N2O flux decrease at low concentration of nitrogen, increase at high concentration in both of the soils. But cases of N2O flux have a lot of fluctuation. While CH4 flux was not detected at all of temperatures and soils.",

            "abstract": "Jordan faces an archetypal combination of high water scarcity, with a per capita water availability of around 150 CM per year significantly below the absolute scarcity threshold of 500 CM, and strong population growth, especially due to the Syrian refugee crisis. This poses a severe challenge to the already strained institutions in the Jordanian water sector. The Stanford-led G8 Belmont Forum project “Integrated Analysis of Freshwater Resources Sustainability in Jordan” aims at analyzing the potential role of water sector institutions in the pursuit of a sustainable freshwater system performance. In order to do so, the project develops a coupled hydrological and agent-based model, allowing for the exploration of physical as well as socio-economic and institutional scenarios for Jordan’s water sector.\nThe part of this integrated model in focus here is the representation of household behavior in Jordan’s densely populated capital Amman. Amman’s piped water supply is highly intermittent, which also affects its potability. Therefore, Amman’s citizens rely on various decentralized modes of supply, depending on their socio-economic characteristics. These include water storage in roof-top and basement tanks, private tanker supply, and the purchase of bottled water. Capturing this combination of centralized and decentralized supply modes is important for an adequate representation of water consumption behavior: Firstly, it will affect the impacts of supply-side and demand-side policies, such as reductions of non-revenue water (including illegal abstractions), the introduction of continuous supply, support for storage enhancements, and water tariff reforms. Secondly, it is also necessary to differentiate the impacts of any policy on the different socio-economic groups in Amman.\nIn order to capture the above aspects of water supply, our model is based on the tiered supply curve approach, developed by Srinivasan et al. in 2011 to model a similar situation in Chennai, India. To tailor our model to the situation in Amman, we rely on sectoral data, existing literature analyses and expert discussions with Jordanian water sector representatives. Our modeling approach allows us to directly compare policies affecting both centralized and decentralized elements of the system within a common framework.",

            "abstract": "Hundreds of organic species are emitted into the atmosphere mostly from biogenic processes. The rapid breakdown by reactions with OH radicals prevents most of them from reaching the stratosphere. Hence, the omnipresent layer of OH in the troposphere shields the stratosphere from these emissions and is particularly relevant for those species that do not photolyse efficiently. Reactions involving ozone are a strong source of OH in clean tropical air. Hence the OH concentration is closely coupled to ozone abundances. The Western Pacific warm pool is key for troposphere to stratosphere exchange. We report measurements of 14 ozonesondes launched during the Transbrom ship cruise through the center of the warm pool. During a 2500km portion of the ship track between 10S and 15N we found ozone concentrations below the detection limit of the sondes throughout the troposphere. We will discuss the uncertainties of ozonesonde measurements at very low ozone concentrations, the robustness of our observations and the upper limit of the ozone concentration that would be consistent with our raw data. Based on modelling and measurements of OH on the ER-2 during the STRAT campaign we suggest that there also is a pronounced minimum in the tropospheric column of OH over the tropical West Pacific. We show that this increases the lifetime of chemical species and has the potential to amplify the impact of surface emissions on the stratospheric composition. Specifically, we discuss the role of emissions of biogenic halogenated species from this geographic region for stratospheric ozone depletion. Also, we discuss the potential role of increasing anthropogenic emissions of SO2 in South East Asia or from minor volcanic eruptions for the stratospheric aerosol budget.",

            "abstract": "Scientific assessments of future climate change tend to focus on central estimates and may understate or ignore the significance of low probability outcomes that may have extremely severe consequences. This relative neglect of tail risks is partly a result of traditions in prediction and forecasting, and conservatism about phenomena for which few data and information exist.\nThe misinterpretation of such scientific assessments can have adverse results. Even though the central estimates of high emissions scenarios present obvious dangers, the tails of lower emissions scenarios still contain very serious risks which may be overlooked by policy-makers. Economic analyses may omit the possibility of catastrophic impacts, leading to substantial under-estimates of damage caused by climate change.\nSo how do we avoid these shortcomings and achieve more effective communication about the risks of climate change?\nThe scientific assessments of climate change differ in significant ways from the formal risk assessment methods successfully employed in other fields. We outline a ‘good practice’ approach to the identification, assessment and communication of potentially catastrophic risks based on examples from sectors such as civil engineering, national security and insurance.\nWe illustrate how this ‘good practice’ approach could be applied to provide a better presentation of some catastrophic tail risks that are outlined in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The risks we consider include the possibility of ‘extreme’ rises in temperature and sea level lying outside the central projections described in the report, and the plausibility of significant releases of methane from the thawing of permafrost.\nUsing these illustrations, we examine how scientific researchers can improve their communication about climate change to assist decision-making, and how policy-makers and politicians might respond differently to alternative presentations of information about the tail risks.",

            "abstract": "The estimation of design rainfall is generally done by applying a regional frequency analysis that uses hydrologic data from a large number of rainfall sites in the region. In this study, index flood method was applied to estimate the quantile of annual maximum rainfall data in Han River basin using cluster analysis. It is important to determine hydrologically homogeneous regions using cluster analyses in regional frequency analysis. The cluster analysis is performed by using precipitation related variables at 104 rainfall observation stations in Han-River basin and regional frequency analysis is applied to estimate rainfall quantile using annual maximum rainfall data of Han River Flood Control Office. Many variables relevant to precipitation can be used for grouping a region in regional frequency analysis. For the regionalization of Han River basin, 4 cluster analyses such as average linked method, WARD method, two-step method, and k-means method are applied for grouping regions by using the results of factor analysis and variables of meteorology and geomorphology. The results of cluster analysis showed that mean annual precipitation, seasonal mean precipitation and geographic information were the main variables affecting to decide the precipitation region. The study area was divided into four regions based on the k-means method of clustering approach. In the final step of the regional scaling-factors analysis, scaling is used to evaluate the accuracy of regional scaling factors. And then, rainfall quantiles by regional scaling factors are compared based on the applied index flood method for rainfall data of Han River basin in South Korea. The relative root mean square error (RRMSE) measure was used to evaluate the accuracy of index flood method and estimation of quantile using regional scaling factors method.",

            "abstract": "Aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) is an important water management option in water-scarce regions. During wet periods surplus water is injected into suitable aquifers for storage and later recovery. ASR sites are, however, also ideal natural laboratories that provide opportunities for studying coupled physical and geochemical processes and water quality evolution at field-scale under well-controlled hydrological conditions. In this study, we use reactive transport modelling to assess the impacts of physical and chemical heterogeneities on the water quality evolution during the injection of oxic surface water into the anoxic, pyrite-bearing Leederville aquifer in Perth, Western Australia. Physical heterogeneity was identified from geophysical well logs and time lapse temperature logs. Those data were used to define the spatial, depth-varying alternation of three lithofacies (sandstone, siltstone and clay). Chemical heterogeneity was incorporated through distinct chemical zones, based on data derived from a comprehensive pre-trial geochemical characterization and from dedicated laboratory respirometer experiments. Calibration of flow and conservative transport parameters was constrained by the spatially varying measured chloride breakthrough behavior. Subsequent reactive transport modeling discerned the key geochemical processes that affected the water quality evolution during ASR. Clearly identified processes included oxidation of pyrite, mineralization of sedimentary organic carbon, ion exchange, dissolution of calcite and precipitation of ferrihydrite and siderite. We use the calibrated model to analyze the individual and the combined effects of the physical and chemical heterogeneities on the chemical composition of the recovered water during ASR.",

We compare the characteristics of the 2013 sequence with those of the 2008, and calculate the static stress changes to identify the interactions between adjacent segments. The WSW-ESE strike of the earthquake epicenters of the 2013 sequence is in accordance with the strike of the major normal faults of the area that as a rule dip to the NNE. On the contrary, the focal mechanisms of the 2013 events identify a seismogenic fault of normal type that dip to the south and stands as an antithetic fault. In addition, the extensional stress regime is further investigated using the information provided from the focal mechanisms of the two sequences.",

This third aspect is especially valid for the data repositories, as they manage data through machine agents. So checks for homogeneity and consistency in early parts of the workflow become essential to cope with today's data volumes.\nSelected parts of the workflow in the model intercomparison project CMIP5 and the archival of the data for the interdiscipliary user community of the IPCC-DDC AR5 and the associated quality checks are reviewed. We compare data and metadata checks and relate different types of checks to their positions in the data life cycle.\nThe project's data citation approach is included in the discussion, with focus on temporal aspects of the time necessary to comply with the project's requirements for formal data citations and the demand for the availability of such data citations.\nIn order to make different quality assessments of projects comparable, WDCC developed a generic Quality Assessment System. Based on the self-assessment approach of a maturity matrix, an objective and uniform quality level system for all data at WDCC is derived which consists of five maturity quality levels.",

            "abstract": "Gas flaring is one of the most controversial energetic and environmental issues the Earth is facing, moreover contributing to the global warming and climate change. According to the World Bank, each year about 150 Billion Cubic Meter of gas are being flared globally, that is equivalent to the annual gas use of Italy and France combined. Besides, about 400 million tons of CO2 (representing about 1.2% of global CO2 emissions) are added annually into the atmosphere.\nEfforts to evaluate the impact of flaring on the surrounding environment are hampered by lack of official information on flare locations and volumes. Suitable satellite based techniques could offers a potential solution to this problem through the detection and subsequent mapping of flare locations as well as gas emissions estimation.\nIn this paper a new methodological approach, based on the Robust Satellite Techniques (RST), a multi-temporal scheme of satellite data analysis, was developed to analyze and characterize the flaring activity of the largest Italian gas and oil pre-treatment plant (ENI-COVA) located in Val d’Agri (Basilicata) For this site, located in an anthropized area characterized by a large environmental complexity, flaring emissions are mainly related to emergency conditions (i.e. waste flaring), being the industrial process regulated by strict regional laws. With reference to the peculiar characteristics of COVA flaring, the RST approach was implemented on 13 years of EOS-MODIS (Earth Observing System – Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) infrared data to detect COVA-related thermal anomalies and to develop a regression model for gas flared volume estimation. The methodological approach, the whole processing chain and the preliminarily achieved results will be shown and discussed in this paper. In addition, the possible implementation of the proposed approach on the data acquired by the SUOMI NPP – VIIRS (National Polar-orbiting Partnership - Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) and the expected improvements will be also discussed.",

            "abstract": "Tidal river and estuary are the transition zone between freshwater and seawater with high biological production. These areas have characteristics of water level fluctuation which causes surface water-groundwater interaction and the associated change in dynamics of nitrogen. Generally in coastal megacities, severe groundwater depression and high contaminants load influence on the environment of tidal river. However, these effects on the nitrogen dynamics and its load from a river to sea have not been fully evaluated in previous studies. Therefore, we aimed to clarify the characteristics of the nitrogen dynamics with the surface water-groundwater interaction in the tidal river zone of Osaka metropolitan city, western Japan. We conducted the field survey from the river mouth to the 7km upstream area of Yamato River, which has a length of 68km and a watershed area of 1,070 km2. Spatial variations in radon (222Rn) concentrations and the difference of hydraulic potential between river waters and the pore waters suggest that the groundwater discharges to the river channel in the upstream area. In contrast, the river water recharged into the groundwater near the river mouth area. It may be caused by the lowering of groundwater level associated with the excess abstraction in the urban area. The spatial and temporal variations in nutrient concentration indicate that nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentration changed temporally and it was negatively correlated with dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) concentration. Based on the mass balance estimation in winter and summer periods, nitrogen was removed in tidal river zone in both periods which was estimated to be about 10 % of total nitrogen (TN) load from the upstream. However, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and DON was re-produced in winter and summer periods, respectively. NO3-N concentrations were negatively correlated with velocity of river water, which suggests the progress of denitrification in the tidal river zone under low discharge condition. Nitrogen and oxygen stable isotope ratios (δ15N, δ18O) of nitrate (NO3-) suggests the possibility of nitrification progress in the winter periods.",

            "abstract": "Seismic studies report the presence of regions below Africa and the Pacific, which exhibit shear-wave velocity reductions of about 3 percent. These so-called large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs), cover approximately half of the core-mantle boundary, making them an important interface between the core and lowermost mantle. The fact that they exhibit different seismic properties indicates that they are different from surrounding mantle, either in temperature and/or composition. The reported sharpness of the boundaries of large low shear velocity provinces suggests that they are at least in part compositional anomalies. One potential explanation is that they comprise the relics of subducted slabs, and thus have mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB). The high temperature and pressure seismic properties of MORB phases, needed to compare with seismic observations, are unknown. Here we report the high temperature and pressure elastic properties of several aluminous phases, which comprise about 20 percent of MORB material. In particular, we have looked at MgAl2O4, NaMg2Al5SiO12, and KMg2Al5SiO12, with the calcium ferrite (CF) and new aluminous (NAL) structure. These should provide further constraints to aid the interpretation of seismic observations, contributing to the thermal vs compositional anomaly debate.",

            "abstract": "In the European Alps lateral extrusion is traditionally viewed as a lithospheric scale process that is related to northward indentation of a weak orogenic wedge (the eastern Alps) by a rigid indenter in upper plate position (the Adriatic plate). Critical for the efficiency of the extrusion process is the presence of a ‘free boundary’ at high angle to the indentation direction. The ‘free boundary’ in the eastern Alps is the result of the eastward extending Pannonian realm synchronous to indentation. However, indentation has become debatable as recent high-resolution tomography suggests that the Adriatic mantle lithosphere subducted under the extruding Alps. These findings raise first order questions related to: (a) the partitioning of deformation between lateral extrusion of the upper plate and coeval subduction of Adria, (b) the rheology of the lower and upper plates, and (c) the rheology of the plate contact controlling the amount of extrusion on the upper plate vs. accretion on the lower plate.\nIn this analog modeling study, we couple for the first time lateral extrusion tectonics to subduction of the lower plate; thus, extrusion taking place in the upper plate. Within the lithospheric scale models, the lithospheres of the two plates are weakly coupled along an inclined boundary and have contrasting mantle lithosphere strength (stronger in the subducting plate). The interplay of extrusion vs subduction is inferred by varying the mechanical boundary conditions, e.g. the degree of resistance at the ‘unconstrained’ margin, the strength contrast between the upper and the lower plates and the width of the indented region.\nThe experimental results emphasize that extrusion in the eastern Alps is compatible with coeval subduction of the Adriatic plate. The first experimental series suggests that the following mechanical conditions play a key role in the interplay between extrusion and subduction: (a) the extruding plate is weaker than the subducting plate, (b) the plate contact is weak in order to trigger the subduction of the lower plate, and (c) the eastern boundary is weak and thus allows for accommodating the extruding upper plate.",

In this region, the Caribbean plate is characterized by a well-consolidated, high velocity framework material beneath the slope sediments, but the nature of the upper plate material is yet unknown. During Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 334 and 344, the unconformity between the slope sediments (Unit 1) and upper plate material (Units 2 and 3) consisting of lithic sedimentary units was penetrated at mid-slope Site 1380. In the current study, to characterize the compaction behavior of the upper plate material, we investigate the physical properties, texture and composition of the sediments at Site 1380 by conducting microstructural observations, resistivity measurements, particle size analyses, X-ray fluorescence and X-ray diffraction analyses.\nThe microstructures of sediments observed through the microscope tend to develop dense and cohesive textures in low porosity sediments, and particle size changes across several unconformities. In particular, the small particle-sized lithic fragments compose larger bodies and form cohesive structures. The cross correlation between measured particle size and shipboard porosity show negative correlation especially at Unit 2, indicating that larger sized particles form smaller or fewer pores. From the results of XRF and XRD analyses, we found that Al, K, Ti tend to concentrate in the higher porosity sediments of Unit 1, whereas Si, Ca, P, Mg, Na, and Mn concentrate in the lower porosity sediments of Unit 2 and 3. The higher concentration in Mg, Na, Mn, Si may be due to minerals such as chlorite, serpentine, amphibole, and sodium manganese. The crossplots between porosity and element concentration show negative correlations in Mg, Na, and Mn with porosity, suggesting that the minerals rich in these elements may relate with the consolidation in Unit 2 and 3.",

            "abstract": "Using centimeter-sized rock specimens, friction experiments have been carried out. Ohnaka and Kuwahara (1990) showed a stably propagating shear strain drop (nucleation phase) followed by its accelerated propagation. Such process was reproduced by numerical simulations considering heterogeneous fault strength and the weakening (e.g., Dieterich, 1992; Matsu'ura et al., 1992). However, in previous studies, the rupture propagation was measured only with 1-D array of strain gauges along in-plane direction. In addition, very few nucleation phenomena were observed in natural earthquakes. We performed friction experiments using a pair of meter-sized Indian gabbro specimens. The fault plane was 1.5 m long and 0.5 m wide. The specimens were loaded at a speed as low as 0.0025 m/s. We continuously observed shear strains and elastic waves with 2-D array of piezoelectric sensors and strain gauges to improve our knowledge about rupture nucleation process. Sensors and gauges were installed at 24 sites located 60 mm below the fault plane at intervals of 150 mm and 75 mm for in-plane and anti-plane directions, respectively. The stick-slip events were extracted using wave amplitudes and the ratio of share and normal stresses. Two typical stable phases (nucleation phases) of decrease in shear strain were recognized followed by the dynamic rupture. The first decrease was initiated around the edge in anti-plane direction (northern side). The decreasing rate was lower than 10-6 s-1, and the decrease preferably propagated in anti-plane direction at a speed slower than 100 m/s. The second decrease was initiated about when the first one reached the opposite end (southern side). The decreasing rate was higher (~10-4 s-1) than that of the first one, and the decrease preferably propagated in anti-plane direction at a higher speed (an order of 100 m/s). About when the second phase got back to the northern end, the rapid decrease (~10-3 s-1) was initiated at the western edge, and two-dimensionally propagated faster than 1 km/s, which corresponded to dynamic rupture. Then, the rupture nucleation and dynamic rupture propagations in laboratory were suggested to be controlled by the sample edge.",

            "abstract": "The GNSS signal propagating from the satellite to the receiver is subjected to the phase delay due to the presence of the atmosphere. The signal’s troposphere phase delay is linked with the density of all gaseous constituencies, including one of the most important - water vapour. Current GNSS processing methodology does not provide a framework for effective estimation of line-of-sight troposphere delay between satellite and receiver because of that a new functional and stochastic modelling should be introduced. Coherently, assimilation of the GNSS observations is relatively new, but very promising approach, to improve the short range forecasts (especially in terms of medium and heavy rainfall systems). With these data it is possible to provide significant amount of information about the 3D structure of the atmosphere. However, there are still many unresolved problems related to the data assimilation; such as, modelling of signal propagation (forward model) as well as correlation in time and space between GNSS observations.\nThis paper introduce the challenges that are going to be addressed within the course of this project: 1) The unique methodology for GNSS Slant Total Delay (STD) estimation will be developed, 2) The method to effectively assimilate the STDs into the NWP model will be investigated, 3) The impact of the GNSS data assimilation on NWP models performance will be derived for the area of Poland.\nThis project requires extensive GNSS signal propagation simulations to establish effective functional and stochastic models of Slant Delay. The impact of additional artefacts (ionosphere, clocks, ambiguities and multipath) on the troposphere estimates will be assessed using synthetic observations derived from numerical weather prediction model fields. This part of research is also linked with establishment of the forward operator that transforms NWP variables into the GNSS observations space. The extensive covariance and auto-covariance analysis of NWP model fields along with the GNSS troposphere estimates will help to build stochastic models in the GNSS processing software, moreover provides an error estimates for assimilation package in Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. In a long run we expect this research will have large impact on the operational weather forecasting.",

            "abstract": "Based on first-principles calculations, we observe that hydrogen has a strong effect on decreasing the density of the hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure of iron. The structural effect is weakly dependent on the ordering pattern of the H defects. However, hydrogen also hardens iron at core pressures. Our theoretical results show that about 0.3 wt.% are needed to fit the density and the compressional velocities of the inner core at equal density and static conditions. Considering the electronic temperature implies larger H amounts. But hydrogen also increases the shear wave velocities of iron. The latter aspect goes against seismic observations that require a decrease of Vs by light elements, even at high-temperature conditions. Any addition of hydrogen to iron must then be compensated by further addition of other light elements, which in turn will make impossible the fitting of the core density. In conclusion, hydrogen is not a \"good\" light element for the core, in a geophysical sense. We equally discuss the behavior of H at high-temperature in hcp iron with a special emphasis on its mobility.",

            "abstract": "During last decade, many researchers have indicated the presence of ionospheric artifacts in SAR and InSAR data, especially in low frequency data. Different methods, such as Faraday rotation-based, azimuth shift-based (pixel offset and Multiple aperture InSAR) and split-spectrum InSAR-based techniques, have been developed to mitigate these ionosphere effect. While the efficacy of these methods was shown in test cases, all existing methods have limitations that reduce their performance in operational applications. Split-spectrum InSAR approaches, which split the image’s range spectrum into sub-bands and measure phase difference between these sub-bands that are introduced by the dispersive ionosphere, are the most promising candidates for operational implementation. While tests indicated their global applicability, they still suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio and from sensitivities to processing errors related to phase unwrapping and low coherence. Therefore, more research is needed to make this approach more reliable and stable.\nTo achieve this purpose, a cascading multiple sub-band InSAR processing combined with quasi-coherent scatter (QCS) approach is put forward. A cascading multiple sub-bands processing is first implemented in order to avoid the largest error source from phase unwrapping. To further increase the signal-to-noise ration for ionospheric phase screen estimation, a quasi-coherent scatter method is implemented. A quasi-coherent scatter was firstly selected based on coherence analysis. Multiple sub-bands processing for ionosphere correction will then only be based on the selected coherent scatters. After this, a geostatistical interpolation method is used to reconstruct the ionospheric phase screen for the whole image.\nTo test the effectiveness of this method, both real data contaminated by ionosphere and ionosphere free data with simulated ionosphere phase screens from WBMOD will be used. For real data, a cross validation with results from Faraday roation is conducted.",

            "abstract": "During northward passes over Mercury's dayside hemisphere, the MESSENGER spacecraft normally enters the dayside magnetosphere before it descends to below ~ 500 km altitude. However, for some of these dayside passes the dayside magnetosphere is completely absent in the magnetometer (MAG) and Fast Imaging Plasma Spectrometer (FIPS) observations. During these “disappearing\" dayside magnetosphere passes the MESSENGER measurements indicate that the spacecraft passed directly from the magnetosheath into the northern magnetospheric cusp and, finally, the high latitude nightside magnetosphere. Likely causes of these unusual events are severe reconnection-driven erosion and/or solar wind compression of the dayside magnetosphere, to the point where the closed field line dayside magnetosphere lies equatorward and/or below the orbit of MESSENGER. A survey of such cases in the MESSENGER data is presented. The hypothesis that these events are produced by extreme dayside magnetosphere reconnection and/or solar wind compression, is tested using ENLIL predictions of solar wind conditions at Mercury orbit and analysis of the MESSENGER measurements in the cusp and high-latitude nightside magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "One mechanism explaining the nucleation and propagation of weak faults with non-Andersonian attitude is the mechanical anisotropy of phyllosilicate-rich mylonitic rocks. We characterized the mechanical anisotropy and (micro-)failure modes of phyllosilicate-rich mylonites from the Grandes Rousses Massif (Helvetic-Dauphinois Domain, French Alps), deformed under brittle conditions after exhumation from metamorphic conditions. We performed uniaxial (UCS) and triaxial (TXT) tests varying the σ1/schistosity angle at varying confining pressures.\nFractures obtained in the lab and observed in nature are stair-stepped at millimeter-scale, and are composed of low-angle segments developed along phyllosilicate layers and high-angle segments cutting the quartz-feldspar layers with an Andersonian (shear fracture) or tensional joint orientation.\nUCS at 90° show high strength and failure mode characterized by both low-angle segments along schistosity and high-angle ones cutting quartz-feldspar layers. UCS at 0° show lower strength and axial splitting along schistosity.\nTXT cover a complete range of inclinations, from 0° to 90°, at confining pressures of 60MPa and 120MPa. Maximum strength is achieved at 0°, strength and minimum strength, attained at 45°, is around 50% with a significant strength anisotropy. The “fault zone” develops mainly along schistosity for tests at 20-70°, whilst Andersonian shear fractures are observed at 0-20° and 70-90°.\nIn the field we defined the paleo-stress field and measured the σ1/schistosity angle (the schistosity is undulated). Noteworthy, also in the field a transition from a failure mode dominated by slip along schistosity to an Andersonian behavior was observed at 70°.\nCombining laboratory and field data, we conclude that mechanical anisotropy of foliated rocks is relevant in a wide range of σ1/schistosity angles and, due to failure modes dominated by along-schistosity slip, influences the angle to σ1 at which new macroscopic fault zones nucleate, which is very different from predictions of Anderson’s theory.",

            "abstract": "A solid pipeline of URM students into the Geosciences has been established in Newark, NJ by introducing them to applied opportunities. Prior to an OEDG program designed to engage URM students, there were no students from or near Newark interested in pursuing geosciences at Rutgers-Newark or Essex Community College, the two local urban campuses. By infusing activities that showed the applied aspects of geoscience and opportunities for careers into regular high school lesson plans, a significant number of students became interested. These students were recruited into a 4-week modular summer institute that focused on energy, mining resources, environment and surface processes. About 90 students per year attended the institute which included 2 local field trips per week, presentations by industry professionals, activities that placed academic subjects into career perspective and a research project that directly affected the well-being of the students and their families. The most interested dozen of the 90 students were invited to participate in a high profile applied project that received significant media coverage, further enhancing their impression of the importance of geosciences. Previous graduates of the program were employed as assistants in subsequent programs to recycle the experience and enthusiasm. This had a positive effect on the persistence of the assistants who viewed themselves as role models to the younger students. The results are burgeoning numbers of URM geoscience majors at Rutgers, offering of geoscience for the first time in 30 years at Essex Community College as well as a new 2+2 geoscience track and several dual-credit courses at local high schools. An important aspect of this pathway or pipeline is that students must be able to clearly see the next step and their role in it. They are very tentative in this essentially pioneering pursuit. If they don’t get a sense of a welcoming community and an ultimate career outcome, they quickly lose interest and retreat to a pursuit or major that is more traditional.",

            "abstract": "The solar EUV irradiance plays a central role in determining the state of the Earth’s upper atmosphere. The EUV irradiance at the shortest wavelengths, which is highly variable over time scales from seconds to decades, is particularly important for many aspects of space weather. Systematic spectrally resolved observations at the shortest EUV wavelengths, however, have been rare and there is a need to develop a methodology for estimating and forecasting the solar irradiance at all EUV wavelengths from sparse data sets. In this presentation we report on our efforts to use AIA DEM calculations to estimate the solar EUV irradiance at wavelength below 450 Å, where the emission is predominately optically thin. To validate our AIA DEM calculations we have performed extensive comparisons with simultaneous observations from the EVE instrument on SDO and the EIS instrument on Hinode and find that with the proper constraints we can generally reproduce the results obtained with detailed spectroscopic observations. Using a proxy for solar activity derived from photospheric magnetic field measurements we extend our model calculations to previous solar cycles and discuss how the model can be used to forecast EUV irradiance variability over short time scales. Finally, we speculate on what is needed to further develop semi-empirical and physical models for use in understanding the solar spectral irradiance at these wavelengths.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge of trace element partition coefficients is crucial for a range of geoscientific applications. Obtaining the necessary experimental data is still a challenging and time consuming task, as the relevant processes typically take place under extreme P/T conditions. In this study, we explore a molecular scale simulation approach to predict mineral-melt partitioning. We use first principles molecular dynamics to investigate the rare earth element Y in the system garnet - melt, with focus on the influence of the melt. To predict the free energy change of the exchange reaction when Y is distributed between two phases, the method of thermodynamic integration is employed. Here we use an alchemical transmutation by which the identity (here expressed by its pseudopotential parameters) of a major element is gradually changed, in our case from 100% Al to 100% Y. The free energy change in turn enables us to predict the phase Y will partition into, as has been done previously for a CaO-Al2O3-SiO2-Y2O3 model system, employing classical force field simulations1. A major advantage of a molecular dynamics approach is that simulations contain information about the melt structure itself, thus enabling us to link observations to structural changes, e.g. a shift of average Y-O coordination number as a function of network connectivity.\nWe choose a garnet-rich peridotite and a mid-ocean ridge basalt as starting compositions. After both melts are equilibrated at 3000 K and ambient pressure, we perform the thermodynamic integration and compare the free energy of the exchange reaction. The first results suggest that it is possible to at least qualitatively predict the behavior of Y in the two model systems, as compared to experimental findings. We will discuss the potential of the method to make quantitative predictions and how the effect of P and T can be evaluated. Potentially, this new tool may allow us to make predictions for almost any composition and condition available to computer simulations, e.g. fluid – mineral element distribution in subduction zones and their P/T dependence or partitioning behavior for melt compositions, not or hardly accessible in experiments.\n1.

            "abstract": "The generating capacity of Chingshui geothermal power plant decreased rapidly after it had operated three years. Chinese Petroleum Corporation (CPC) attributed the main reason was the depletion of reservoir. One reason was that the reservoir did not be recharged. And the other was the mineral scale in reservoir and pipes which caused flow rate decreased. There are abundant geothermal energy in Taiwan. But in Chingshui, the spring has amount content of carbonate. Most scaling are calcium carbonate and silica. These two materials have different solubility in various pH and physical conditions. Because the pressure reduced in the process of upwelling, the hot spring from the reservoir deposited calcium carbonate immediately by large carbon dioxide escape. This result caused the diameter of pipeline reduced. Besides, as the temperature decreased, the silica would scaling in the part of heat exchanger. To avoid the failure experience in Chingshui , how to prevent the mineral scaling is the key point that we need to solve. Our study will use hydrothermal experiments by High Pressure Thermal Vessel to simulate the process of spring water upwelling from reservoir to surface, to understand whether calcium carbonate and silica scaling or not in different temperature and pressure. This study choose the Hongchailin well as objects to simulate, and the target layers of drilling well were set as Szeleng sandstone and Lushan slate. We used pure water and saturated water pressure in our experiments. There were four vessels in High thermal vessel. The first vessel was used to simulate the condition of reservoir. The second and third vessel were simulated the conditions in the well when spring water upwelling to the surface. And the last vessel was simulated the conditions on surface surroundings. We hope to get the temperature and pressure when the scaling occurred, and verified with the computing result, thus we can inhibit the scaling.",

            "abstract": "While many common snow cover models allow for spatially distributed representation of the snow pack, most in-situ measurement techniques determining snow properties and state variables are invasive, destructive, and in most cases single point measurements. Fiber optic distributed temperature sensing (FO-DTS) provides a way to obtain hundreds of data points in the snow at a time in various problem-adapted configurations with cable lengths of several hundred meters. We present several experiments employing different geometrical FO cable arrangements in the snow in an attempt to obtain small-scale statistical information on snow temperature distribution and variability and the resulting subsurface (conductive) heat fluxes. The spatially distributed conductive heat fluxes are computed based on the Fourier heat equation using snow temperature and snow depth data, and an effective snow thermal conductivity derived from collocated density measurements. The temperature measurements and the simple heat flux calculations are then compared to corresponding results from the detailed SNOWPACK model. These comparisons investigate the closure of the local energy balance and show the relation between DTS temperatures and model estimations of snow thermal conductivity and conductive heat fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Energy production from renewable sources such as solar or wind power is characterized by temporally varying power supply. The politically intended transition towards renewable energies in Germany („Energiewende“) hence requires the installation of energy storage technologies to compensate for the fluctuating production. In this context, subsurface energy storage represents a viable option due to large potential storage capacities and the wide prevalence of suited geological formations. Technologies for subsurface energy storage comprise cavern or deep porous media storage of synthetic hydrogen or methane from electrolysis and methanization, or compressed air, as well as heat storage in shallow or moderately deep porous formations. Pressure build-up, fluid displacement or temperature changes induced by such operations may affect local and regional groundwater flow, geomechanical behavior, groundwater geochemistry and microbiology. Moreover, subsurface energy storage may interact and possibly be in conflict with other “uses” like drinking water abstraction or ecological goods and functions. An utilization of the subsurface for energy storage therefore requires an adequate system and process understanding for the evaluation and assessment of possible impacts of specific storage operations on other types of subsurface use, the affected environment and protected entities.\nThis contribution presents the framework of the ANGUS+ project, in which tools and methods are developed for these types of assessments. Synthetic but still realistic scenarios of geological energy storage are derived and parameterized for representative North German storage sites by data acquisition and evaluation, and experimental work. Coupled numerical hydraulic, thermal, mechanical and reactive transport (THMC) simulation tools are developed and applied to simulate the energy storage and subsurface usage scenarios, which are analyzed for an assessment and generalization of the imposed THMC-processes, mutual effects and influences on protected entities. The scenario analyses allow the deduction of monitoring concepts as well as a first methodology for large scale spatial planning of the geological subsurface. This concept is illustrated for different storage options and their impacts in space and time.",

Here we investigate its dynamical impacts on the large-scale circulation and heat transport in the Atlantic Ocean by performing a set of experiments with a global ocean-sea ice model. The simulations suggest that the ongoing warming of AABW, already affecting much of the Southern Hemisphere with a rate of up to 0.05 °C per decade, has important implications for the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). While the abyssal northward flow of AABW is weakening, we find the upper cell of the AMOC to progressively strengthen by 5-10% in response to deep density changes in the South Atlantic. The simulations suggest that the AABW-induced strengthening of the AMOC is already extending into the subtropical North Atlantic, implying that the process may counteract the projected decrease of the AMOC in the next decades.",

            "abstract": "Core-log integration has been applied for rock mechanics studies in scientific ocean drilling since 2007 in plate subduction margins such as Nankai Trough, Costa Rica margin, and Japan Trench. State of stress in subduction wedge is essential for controlling dynamics of plate boundary fault. One of the common methods to estimate stress state is analysis of borehole breakouts (drilling induced borehole wall compressive failures) recorded in borehole image logs to determine the maximum horizontal principal stress orientation. Borehole breakouts can also yield possible range of stress magnitude based on a rock compressive strength criterion. In this study, we constrained the stress magnitudes based on two different rock failure criteria, the Mohr-Coulomb (MC) criteria and the modified Wiebols-Cook (mWC) criteria. As the MC criterion is the same as that under unconfined compression state, only one rock parameter, unconfined compressive strength (UCS) is needed to constrain stress magnitudes. The mWC criterion needs the UCS, Poisson’s ratio and internal frictional coefficient determined by triaxial compression experiments to take the intermediate principal stress effects on rock strength into consideration. We conducted various strength experiments on samples taken during IODP Expeditions 334/344 (Costa Rica Seismogenesis Project) to evaluate reliable method to estimate stress magnitudes. Our results show that the effects of the intermediate principal stress on the rock compressive failure occurred on a borehole wall is not negligible.",

We analyzed observed data when the tsunami might be reached the area of our observation, however no tsunami was detected. And we carried out numerical modeling on the far field tsunami. Because the computed velocity near the radars was smaller than the critical observable velocity (4.8 cm/s), we couldn’t recognize the tsunami obviously. To study performance of observation of our Oceanographic Radars for the far field tsunamis off the coast of Chile, we chose largest earthquake of M9.5 generated in 1960. We confirm whether the largest tsunami can be detected by the radars. In addition, we examine suitable place to observe the far field tsunamis. We believe that an improvement of tsunami detection technology by using Oceanographic Radar can increase reliabilities of tsunami warning and searching severe damaged areas, then we hope to contribute to upgrading tsunami disaster mitigation.",

            "abstract": "The crustal dichotomy is the dominant geological feature on planet Mars. The exogenic approach to the origin of the crustal dichotomy assumes that the northern lowlands correspond to a giant impact basin formed after primordial crust formation. However these simulations only consider the impact phase without studying the long-term repercussions of such a collision.\nThe endogenic approach, suggesting a degree-1 mantle upwelling underneath the southern highlands, relies on a high Rayleigh number and a particular viscosity profile to form a low degree convective pattern within the geological constraints for the dichotomy formation. Such vigorous convection, however, results in continuous magmatic resurfacing, destroying the initially dichotomous crustal structure in the long-term.\nA further option is a hybrid exogenic–endogenic approach, which proposes an impact-induced magma ocean and subsequent superplume in the southern hemisphere. However these models rely on simple scaling laws to impose the thermal effects of the collision.\nHere we present the results of impact simulations performed with a SPH code serially coupled with geodynamical computations performed using the code I3VIS to improve the latter approach and test it against observations. We are exploring collisions varying the impactor velocities, impact angles and target body properties, and are gauging the sensitivity to the handoff from SPH to I3VIS.\nOur results indicate the formation of a transient hemispherical magma ocean in the impacted hemisphere, and the merging of the cores. We also find that impact angle and velocity have a strong effect on the post-impact temperature field and on the timescale and nature of core merger.",

            "abstract": "The Amazon forest, a regional and global regulator of climate and store of enormous biodiversity, is an incredibly complex ecosystem. Just one ha of forest can contain 300 different species of tree, with an estimated 16,000 tree species present in the region. Different tree species, and even different individuals of a species, vary in their functional traits, influencing how they behave in response to the environment. Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) are commonly used to simulate the response of the Amazon forest to global environmental change. Yet, such DGVMs typically use a plant functional type (PFT) approach where variation between individuals and species are not represented, which inherently limits the range of outcomes for Amazonia under climate change. Here, we report on recent advances in an alternative approach to tropical forest modeling that represents the size structure and variation of traits within a community, which we term the Trait-based Forest Simulator (TFS). As originally proposed, TFS was strictly a steady-state model and here we present an extension of TFS which includes full forest dynamics, and has been evaluated with data collected from intensive carbon cycling inventory plots from the GEM (Global Ecosystems Monitoring) network. Specifically, we compare the model output to stand-level data on productivity and respiration of the canopy, stems and roots. The model development process has highlighted ecological tradeoffs that are necessary to integrate into trait-based models, such as a shorter leaf lifetime with a lower leaf mass per area. The adapted TFS model simulates carbon cycling in forest plots, including variation in productivity between sites. These results lend confidence to the ability of next-generation vegetation models to accurately simulate forest sensitivity to future changes.",

This work is presently conducted in the framework of the Franco-Chinese LIA-MONOCL\nThanks to the Westpac project, we had access to sediments collected in the deltas of the main rivers feeding the South China Sea from about 25°N to the equator. This is represented on the Asian continent by the Pearl river, the Red River, the Mekong river, by Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo regions with minor rivers but also contributing to the South China Sea, and finally by Luzon and Taiwan. The geological formations contributing to the river sediment discharges are different from one catchment basin to another as well as the present climatic conditions.\nThe magnetic analyses consist in the analysis of low-field magnetic susceptibility, ARM acquisition and decay, IRM acquisition and decay, back-field acquisition, thermal demagnetization of 3-axes IRM, hysteresis parameters, and FORC diagrams. The obtained parameters all together allow us to define the nature of the magnetic grains and their grain size distribution when magnetite is dominant. Some degree of variability is observed at the river mouths, illustrating different geological sources at the local/regional scale. As an average, it appears that the Southern basin of the South China Sea is surrounded by regions richer in high coercivity magnetic minerals than the northern basin. This mineral is identified as hematite while magnetites (and sulfides) are more abundant in the north. These results are complementary to the clay mineral assemblages previously determined on the same samples.\nThe first steps of a similar study conducted on marine core-tops well distributed in the South China Sea will also be illustrated.",

Elemental abundance ratios point to a similar climatic origin for these variations and exclude a quadripartite structure as an explanation for the inferred semi-precession cyclicity in the magnetic susceptibility (MS) signal as observed in the Mediterranean Neogene for precession related cycles. However, semi-precession cycles as suggested by previous work are likely an artifact reflecting the first harmonic of the precession signal. The sub-Milankovitch variability, especially in MS, is best approximated by a ~ 7 kyr cycle as shown by spectral analysis and bandpass filtering. The presence of sub-Milankovitch cycles with a period similar to that of Heinrich events of the last glacial cycle is consistent with linking the latter to low-latitude climate change caused by a non-linear response to precession induced variations in insolation between the tropics.",

            "abstract": "The Nankai trough in southwestern Japan is a convergent margin where the Philippine Sea plate is subducting beneath the Eurasian plate. We have conducted five seismic observations with ocean bottom seismograms (OBSs) from 2008 to 2012 to elucidate detailed seismic structures and its relations with fault segments of large earthquakes. These observations covered the entire area of the Nankai trough, but quantity and quality of data are not spatially uniform because of different observing lengths and various noises. Waveform data of OBSs suggests variously-sized anomalies of random velocity inhomogeneity (i.e., scattering strength) in this subduction zone. To clarify details of random inhomogeneity structures, we conducted a transdimensional imaging of random inhomogeneities by means of the reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (rjMCMC) without assuming smooth spatial distributions of unknown parameters.\nWe applied the rjMCMC for the inversion of peak delay times of S-wave envelopes at 4-8, 8-16, and 16-32 Hz, where the peak delay time is defined as the time lag from the S-wave onset to its maximal amplitude arrival. This delay time mainly reflects the accumulated multiple forward scattering effect due to random inhomogeneities. We assumed the von Karman type power spectral density function (PSDF) for random velocity fluctuation, and estimated two parameters related with the PSDF at large wavenumber. Study area is partitioned by discrete Voronoi cells of which number and spatial sizes are variable. Estimated random inhomogeneities show clear lateral variations along the Nankai trough. The strongest inhomogeneity on the Nankai trough was found near the subducted Kyushu-Palau ridge that is located at the western margin of the fault segments. We also find a horizontal variation of inhomogeneity along the non-volcanic tremor zone. Relatively strong inhomogeneities in this tremor zone were imaged beneath west Shikoku and Kii-Peninsula. These anomalies were not clearly imaged in our previous study because we had to impose smoothing constraints. Our result implies that transdimensional imaging can be used to reveal detailed seismic structures from spatially non-uniform data.",

In addition, processes involved in earthquake generation and the physics of short-term seismic transients, 4D deformations to understand earthquake cycle processes, fluid activity monitoring and seismicity under the sea floor using existing autonomous instrumentation, early warning and development of real-time shake and loss information, real- and quasi-real-time earthquake and tsunami hazard monitoring and earthquake-induced landslide hazard topics are also covered within MARSite. This presentation would provide a report on the progress achieved during the half-life of the project. In this respect, the main data server for the integration of real time network data has been finalized. Daily evaluation of online spring water and soil radon gas data in relation to seismic activity is in place, together with the continuous GPS data processing. A significant combination of postseismic (viscoelastic) deformation and afterslip was detected in the western segment of the 1999 Izmit rupture plane based on InSAR modeling. The optimum borehole depths have been identified based on seismic reflection studies and GURALP Systems is continuing its work on the manufacturing the borehole system. Seismic risk study for IGDAS Natural Gas Network including pipelines and its components has been carried out with several earthquake scenarios in Marmara Sea and an automatic shut-off algorithm has been developed for the automatic shut-off of the gas flow at the IGDAS district regulators during an extreme event.",

In this study, we investigate the effect of velocity structure under the CMB on the differential traveltimes between SKKS and S3KS waves. Due to the long propagation distances and interference with neighboring phases, the arrival times of SKKS and S3KS waves are difficult to define accurately. Therefore, we measure the differential traveltimes by cross-correlating the waveform of the Hilbert-transformed S3KS with that of SKKS. Differential traveltimes derived from synthetics calculated by the direct-solution method for different velocity structures under the CMB are compared with those from records to examine the existence of a low-velocity zone at the top of the outer core. We also conduct a Bayesian inversion of the observed differential traveltimes for the velocity structure at the top of the outer core.",

            "abstract": "We have statistically examined plasma wave activity observed in the near Earth magnetotail reconnection events. Geotail encountered about 40 clear reconnection sites during 20 years observation where the enhanced cross-tail electron current layer was detected in association with the simultaneous plasma flow and magnetic field reversals. The intense plasma wave activity in wide frequency range is observed in the electron-ion decoupling region around the X-line. However, surprisingly, wave intensity right at the center of the electron current layers, those are possible X-lines, is much weaker than that in its surrounding region. Zenitani et al. (2012) successfully estimated the energy dissipation rate of the best reconnection event (May 15, 2013 event), and their result is also consistent with our interpretation that the observed wave activity cannot be a major player of the reconnection dissipation. These Geotail observed events suggest that the magnetic diffusion region of the near Earth magnetotail reconnection site is mainly controlled by the physics of the collisionless reconnection process, rather than the anomalous resistivity.\nDespite this conclusion, the wave activity observed in the electron-ion decoupling region and the plasma sheet boundary region has still unignorable wave power to the electron heating. In order to address the role of the wave activity in the lower-hybrid frequency range around the X-lines, we have done a statistical survey of the wave activity and its relation to the structure of the magnetotail reconnection site. Based on the reconnection events shown in Nagai et al. (2013), we have examined the excitation process of the wave activity in the context of the 3-dimensional structure of the magnetotail reconnection. We found that wave activity in the dusk-side reconnection site (MHD like dawnward flow region) is much weaker than that in the ion-electron decoupling region of the post-midnight reconnection sites while similar activity can be seen in the dawn-side reconnection sites. These new findings will be a hint to understand the dawn-dusk evolution of the magentaotail diffusion region.",

            "abstract": "The link between physical erosion and chemical weathering is generally modelled with a surface-blanketing weathering zone, where the supply of fresh minerals is tied to the average rate of denudation. In very fast eroding environments, however, sediment production is dominated by landsliding, which acts in a stochastic fashion across the landscape, contrasting strongly with more uniform denudation models. If physical erosion is a driver of weathering at the highest erosion rates, then an alternative weathering model is required.\nHere we show that landslides can be effective ‘weathering reactors’. Previous work modelling the effect of landslides on chemical weathering (Gabet 2007) considered the fresh bedrock surfaces exposed in landslide scars. However, fracturing during the landslide motion generates fresh surfaces, the total surface area of which exceeds that of the exposed scar by many orders of magnitude. Moreover, landslides introduce concavity into hillslopes, which acts to catch precipitation. This is funnelled into a deposit of highly fragmented rock mass with large reactive surface area and limited hydraulic conductivity (Lo et al. 2007). This allows percolating water reaction time for chemical weathering; any admixture of macerated organic debris could yield organic acid to further accelerate weathering.\nIn the South island of New Zealand, seepage from recent landslide deposits has systematically high solute concentrations, far outstripping concentration in runoff from locations where soils are present. River total dissolved load in the western Southern Alps is highly correlated with the rate of recent (<35yrs) landsliding, suggesting that landslides are the dominant locus of weathering in this rapidly eroding landscape. A tight link between landsliding and weathering implies that localized weathering migrates through the landscape with physical erosion; this contrasts with persistent and ubiquitous weathering associated with soil production. Solute fluxes from fast eroding landscapes therefore likely depend on climatic or tectonic forcing of mass wasting; greater precipitation would drive increased weathering, while earthquakes, in generating landslides (Dadson et al. 2003; Chen & Hawkins 2009), may be important in setting long term solute fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Tsunami-induced flooding represents one of the most dangerous natural hazards to coastal communities around the world, as exemplified by Tohoku tsunami of March 2011. In order to further understand this hazard and to design appropriate mitigation it is necessary to develop versatile, accurate software capable of simulating large scale tsunami propagation and interaction with coastal geomorphology on a local scale. One such software package is Fluidity, an open source, finite element, multiscale, code that is capable of solving the fully three dimensional Navier-Stokes equations on unstructured meshes. Such meshes are significantly better at representing complex coastline shapes than structured meshes and have the advantage of allowing variation in element size across a domain. Furthermore, Fluidity incorporates a novel wetting and drying algorithm, which enables accurate, efficient simulation of tsunami run-up over complex, multiscale, topography. Fluidity has previously been demonstrated to accurately simulate the 2011 Tohoku tsunami (Oishi et al 2013) , but its wetting and drying facility has not yet been tested on a geographical scale. This study makes use of Fluidity to simulate the 2011 Tohoku tsunami and its interaction with Japan's eastern shoreline, including coastal flooding. The results are validated against observations made by survey teams, aerial photographs and previous modelling efforts in order to evaluate Fluidity's current capabilities and suggest methods of future improvement. The code is shown to perform well at simulating flooding along the topographically complex Tohoku coast of Japan, with major deviations between model and observation arising mainly due to limitations imposed by bathymetry resolution, which could be improved in future. In theory, Fluidity is capable of full multiscale tsunami modelling, thus enabling researchers to understand both wave propagation across ocean basins and flooding of coastal landscapes down to interaction with individual defence structures. This makes the code an exciting candidate for use in future studies aiming to investigate tsunami risk elsewhere in the world.\nOishi, Y. et al.

The field program combined\nground-based observations of tropospheric and lower stratospheric flow\nand stratospheric and mesospheric temperature by lidars and radars at\nAlomar (N) and at Esrange (S) with airborne and balloonborne\nobservations. Northern Scandinavia was chosen since the westerly flow\nacross the mountains is often aligned with the polar night jet\npermitting gravity waves (GWs) to propagate into the middle atmosphere.\nFrom 2 until 14 December 2013, 24 flight hours of the DLR Falcon flown\nin four intensive observing periods (IOPs) provided in-situ and\nremote-sensing observations of atmospheric wind, temperature, water\nvapour and other trace gases (e.g. CO, N2O, O3) in the vicinity of the\ntropopause. During three IOPs, the airborne observations were supported\nby 3 hourly simultaneous radiosonde launches from Andøya (N), Esrange\n(S) and Sodankylä (FIN). Additionally, 1.5 hourly high-frequency\nradiosonde launches were conducted from the Arena Arctica at Kiruna\nairport with two systems (Väisälä and GRAW)and different balloon\nfillings to obtain different ascent rates.\nDuring GW-LCYCLE, the atmospheric flow above the Scandinavian mountains\nwas observed under distinct meteorological conditions enabling or\nattenuating the deep vertical propagation of mountain-induced gravity\nwaves. The presentation juxtaposes two different cases and analyses the\nassociated meteorological conditions.

            "abstract": "We derive empirical magnitude scaling relationships between initial P-wave magnitudes (MLp) and the corresponding local magnitudes (ML). We used a dataset of approximately 6000 earthquakes, range in magnitude from 2.0 to 7.0, recorded in Turkey between 2010 and 2013. Only vertical components of waveform records, both velocity and acceleration, were used for MLp scaling assuming linear relationship between MLp and local magnitudes. Linear fitting results show that the residual-mean-square is around 0.02 for full set of data. The average error in calculated MLp magnitudes is 0.20 magnitude units for events with magnitudes smaller than 3.5 (M<3.5), 0.25 magnitude units for events with magnitudes from 3.5 to 5.0 (3.5<=M<5.0) and 0.30 magnitude units for events with magnitudes greater than 5.0 (M>=5.0). Proposed MLp scaling relationship could be used to estimate reasonable earthquake magnitude rapidly without waiting for S-wave arrivals.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic calderas often show a behavior different from that of other volcanoes. In caldera complexes, it is not unusual to record long-term unrests, with remarkable ground deformation, seismicity, and geochemical changes, that do not culminate in an eruption. On the contrary, in certain cases, an unrest accompanied by minor geophysical changes can be followed in few months by an eruption, as in the case of Rabaul Caldera in 1994. Those behaviors are not simple to interpret. The dramatic advances in volcano monitoring over the last years has allowed us to record the dynamic phenomena of several calderas with great detail. This, highlighted characteristics that are typical of a single caldera, but also some features common to several calderas. The main common features are remarkable ground deformation with intense uplift episodes, that are often followed by subsidence. The ground deformations are generally characterized by strong horizontal components. The seismicity is almost always in swarms and has a spatial distribution that often shows seismic gaps. Moreover, calderas are the largest geothermal systems in the world. We think that a process of sill intrusion can explain the common features highlighted by many observations carried out on different calderas. We developed a dynamic model of sill intrusion in a shallow volcanic environment. In our model, the sill, fed by a deeper magma reservoir, intrudes below a horizontal elastic plate, representing the overlying rocks, and expands with axisymmetric geometry. The model is based on the numerical solution of the equation for the elastic plate, coupled with a Navier-Stokes equation for simulating the dynamics of the sill intrusion. We performed a number of simulations, with the objective of showing the main features of the model. In the experiments, when the feeding process stops, the vertical movement reverses its trend and the area of maximum uplift undergoes subsidence. Under certain conditions the subsidence can occur even during the intrusion of the sill. The stress field produced by the intrusion is mainly concentrated in a circular zone that follows the sill intrusion front. Results are consistent with the characteristics of calderas, described above.",

Here we present records of δ30Si (30Si/28Si) from the Lake Baikal drainage basin in central Siberia to understand silicon cycling through the dominant river tributaries and into Lake Baikal itself, the world’s deepest and most voluminous lake containing one fifth of all freshwater not stored in glaciers and ice caps.\nWaters were collected along an upstream transect for the five dominant Lake Baikal inflows as well as from the Selenga Delta which account for >50% of the annual riverine flow to the lake. Samples for dissolved silicon (DSi) concentrations and silicon isotopic signatures (δ30SiDSi) were filtered and acidified in the field with isotopic analyses conducted on a Neptune + Multi-Collector ICP-MS using wet plasma mode with Mg doping of samples and standard-sample-standard bracketing. Analytical reproducibility is 0.11‰ (2σ) and blanks are <1% of signal intensity. The DSi concentration of all river inflow samples varies from c. 2.5-6.3 ppm, which contrasts with concentrations of < 1ppm from the Angara River, the lake's only outflow. Combined with river δ30SiDSi values of c. + 0.94 to +1.52‰ and lake water and outflow values of c. +2.50‰, the results show significant (up to 60%) biological utilisation of silicon entering the lake.\nWith the Lake Baikal having been designated a World Heritage Site since 1996, due to its high level of biological endemicity, the work in combination with sediment cores from the lake provides an insight into the transportation and fate of silicon in the basin and an assessment of how climate change and expanding anthropogenic activities in the region including urbanisation, deforestation, agriculture and mining have impacted biogeochemical cycling.",

            "abstract": "Soils are of critical importance in modulating the response of catchment water storage and flux dynamics under changing hydrological conditions. We explored the short term impacts of an extreme drought on the water storage and transmission dynamics of different hydropedological units, and the role of their spatial organisation on the runoff generation at the integrated catchment scale in a northern environment. Soil types included poorly drained histosols in riparian zones and freely draining podzols on steeper hillslopes in a northern headwater catchment (3.2 km2) in the Scottish Highlands. We employed an integrated monitoring approach of hydrometric data and stable water isotopes in precipitation, stream, soil, and groundwater, to characterise the spatio-temporal storage and runoff dynamics before, during and after a drought period.\nWe found high spatial variability in the storage resistance and resilience to drought impacts, associated with the distribution of the different soil types, and exacerbated by land use. For example, storage changes in the riparian histosols were remarkably small (<40 mm) during the dry period, compared to those in hillslope moorland (~100 mm) and forest (~200mm) covered podzols. However, results showed that during events, there was consistent threshold behaviour in all soil units and their integrated response at the catchment scale, which appeared not to be affected by relative drying or wetting conditions. The data analyses indicated that during dry periods, large parts of the catchment were disconnected from the river network and runoff was generated mainly from the permanently wet riparian histosols. However, during events there was a quasi-continuous connection of the upper hillslopes that recharged the wetland and stream, which did not appear to have been affected by the drought. This caused a strong recovery and resilience of the catchment in its integrated runoff response. Nevertheless, as future climate projections for northern environments suggest that prolonged warm and dry periods are likely to become more frequent, further work is needed on the potential cumulative or carry over effects of consequative dry periods and the role of the spatial organisation of soil and vegetation characteristics therein.",

            "abstract": "Greenland Ice Sheet melt has the potential to affect global sea levels and the strength of the thermohaline circulation (THC). Investigating spatial mixing patterns of seawater in Greenlandic fjords can help reveal characteristics of changes in runoff from the GrIS; for example higher runoff may be associated with lower salinity within GrIS fjords, which can be recorded by palaeoenvironmental proxies (Kamenos et al 2012). The Kangerlussuaq Drainage Basin mirrors melt patterns of the whole GrIS and drains into Søndre Strømfjord, a 170km long fjord on the west coast of Greenland. Temperature and salinity profiles to 40m depth were obtained at 11 stations along Søndre Strømfjord during the 2014 melt season. Each station was sampled twice once at high KDB runoff and once at low KDB runoff. With increasing freshwater runoff, salinity decreases by 1.65 – 2.91 at each station over a 7 hour time period. Higher salinities occur at low run-off. In addition, with increasing run-off, the disparity between surface and deeper water (30m) becomes greater with a 19.3 difference between the surface and 30m. With higher KDB runoff temperature increases by 0.47oC – 2.34oC. This information will be integrated with oxygen and deuterium isotope patterns to pinpoint the exact source of the runoff causing salinity reductions. Our data show a relationship between KDB runoff and salinity of Søndre Strømfjord, data that will enable further calibration of marine proxies of GrIS melt.",

The goal of this study was to evaluate changes in abundance and diversity of planktonic ammonia-oxidizing Archaea (e.g., Thaumarchaeota) along a salinity gradient from the lower Pearl River to the northern South China Sea. Quantitative PCR and sequencing of total archaeal 16S rRNA gene and the archaeal amoA gene were performed on suspended particulate organic matter collected in different seasons from the freshwater to the ocean water. Total amoA gene copies and relative abundance of Thaumarchaeota all peaked in the estuary where salinity ranged between 4.5‰ and 26.7‰. The diversity of archaeal amoA gene was also highest in the estuary. Seasonality and SiO32- appear to be two major factors affecting the distribution of subclusters of archaeal amoA genes. For example, Nitrosopumilus subcluster 7.1 was most abundant in winter in fresh water, whereas Nitrososphaera were more abundant in summer. Samples collected from the area around Wanshan Island, which is located at the outermost part of the Pearl River estuary, had high abundance of unclassified archaeal amoA genes, suggesting some new groups of Thaumarchaeota might inhabit this water body. Overall, the high abundance and diversity of Thaumarchaeota in the Pearl River estuary may indicate enhanced role of AOA in nitrogen cycle in this dynamic ecosystem.",

            "abstract": "The Andaman Sea is an enigmatic feature in the Indian Ocean region. To the west, it is bounded by a near arc parallel Andaman subduction system and to the east by the Malaya Peninsula. It hosts volcanic provinces like Alcock and Sewell Rises and the Andaman Sea Spreading Center (ASSC) that connects the sliver strike-slip Sagaing Fault in the north with the Andaman Nicobar and Great Sumatra Faults in the south. The actual spreading center follows a succession of basins, starting by the spreading of the Mergui basin in the south-east, 32 Ma ago, that shifted to the actual position of the spreading closer to the subduction trench. Several hypotheses have been proposed for the formation of the Andaman Sea basins: (a) Pull-apart basin along the Sagaing-Sumatra fault system, driven by the collision-extrusion mechanism and/or by the slip-partitioning induced by the oblique subduction, (b) Back-arc spreading due to the subduction. There is a debate about the orientation of the present spreading/extension between the North-South motion along the strike-slip faults and the NW-SE opening of the ASSC. We have access to 7000 km of high-resolution deep seismic reflection data, and high-resolution bathymetry data, which we combine with relocated earthquake data to shed light upon the formation and evolution of the Andaman Sea Basin. The central basin contains up to 4 km thick sediments. The crustal thickness is about 5-8 km in the central basin and increases to 13-15 km beneath the Alcock and Sewell Rises, which are devoid of sediments. Here we show how both the collision and the subduction play a role in the position and orientation of the extension in the Andaman Sea Basin, and how they influence the accretion at the spreading center.",

Nevertheless, the effect of hydrogen on the property of iron alloys is little known so far. The earlier experimental study by Hirao et al. [2004 GRL] examined the compression behavior of dhcp FeHx (x ≈ 1) and found that it becomes much stiffer than pure iron above 50 GPa, where magnetization disappears.\nHere we examined the solubility of hydrogen into iron-rich Fe-Si alloys and the compression behavior of dhcp Fe-Si-H alloy at room temperature. Fe+6.5wt.%Si or Fe+9wt.%Si foil was loaded into a diamond-anvil cell (DAC), and then liquid hydrogen was introduced at temperatures below 20 K. X-ray diffraction measurements at SPring-8 revealed the formation of a dhcp phase with or without thermal annealing by laser above 8.4 GPa. The concentration of hydrogen in such dhcp lattice was calculated following the formula reported by Fukai [1992]; y = 0.5 and 0.2 for Fe-6.5wt.%Si-H or Fe-9wt.%Si-H alloys, respectively when y is defined as Fe(1-x)SixHy. Unlike Fe-H alloy, hydrogen didn’t fully occupy the octahedral sites even under hydrogen-saturated conditions in the case of Fe-Si-H system. Anomaly was observed in obtained pressure-volume curve around 44 Å3 of unit-cell volume for both Fe-6.5wt.%Si-H and Fe-9wt.%Si-H alloys, which may be related to the spin transition in the dhcp phase. They became slightly stiffer at higher pressures, but their compressibility was still similar to that of pure iron.",

Native Alaskans have strong subsistence and cultural connections to the land and its resources, and, in addition to being keen observers of their environment, have a long history of adapting to changing conditions. Participants in the camp included Elders, classroom teachers, local resource managers and planners, community members, and climate scientists.

Recently, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has become an increasingly popular method, both in the lab and the field, for hydrogeophysical investigations due to its sensitivity to water content and pore surface area. Additionally, previous work has shown that the electrical formation factor can be used as a proxy for the tortuosity of the pore space—a parameter NMR is incapable of detecting—in permeability models. However, the formation factor is impossible to accurately measure in the field using DC electrical methods, as the measured conductivity cannot be decomposed into the fluid and surface conduction components. Therefore, our approach is to use induced polarization (IP) and spectral induced polarization (SIP) in the laboratory to correct for the influence of surface conductivity in the formation factor calculation. The corrected formation factor can then be used along with NMR parameters for more accurate permeability estimation.\nLaboratory SIP and NMR datasets were acquired on 40 sandstone cores with a range of permeabilities spanning six orders of magnitude as estimated from gas permeameter measurements. We examine how different estimates of the electrical formation factor can be combined with the NMR transverse relaxation time to estimate permeability. Specifically, we compare the electrical formation factor measured at high and low pore-fluid salinity with the formation factor derived using IP and SIP. Using both empirical and mechanistic petrophysical relationships, we explore the utility of IP- and SIP-corrected formation factors in tandem with NMR parameters for permeability prediction as compared to the low-salinity formation factor typically measured in the field. Furthermore, we develop our models using IP and SIP data that may be acquired in the field. Going forward, our goal is to develop robust electrical-NMR models that can be applied to laboratory, well-log and surface geophysical data.",

            "abstract": "Icelandic ice caps, covering ~11% of the country, are known to be surging glaciers. Such process implies an important local crustal subsidence due to the large ice mass being transported to the ice edge during the surge in a few months only. In 1993-1995, a glacial surge occurred at four neighboring outlet glaciers in the southwestern part of Vatnajökull ice cap, the largest ice cap in Iceland. We estimated that ~16±1 km3 of ice have been moved during this event while the fronts of some of the outlet glaciers advanced by ~1 km.\nSurface deformation associated with this surge has been surveyed using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) acquisitions from 1992-2002, providing high resolution ground observations of the study area. The data show about 75 mm subsidence at the ice edge of the outlet glaciers following the transport of the large volume of ice during the surge (Fig. 1).\nThe long time span covered by the InSAR images enabled us to remove ~12 mm/yr of uplift occurring in this area due to glacial isostatic adjustment from the retreat of Vatnajökull ice cap since the end of the Little Ice Age in Iceland. We then used finite element modeling to investigate the elastic Earth response to the surge, as well as confirm that no significant viscoelastic deformation occurred as a consequence of the surge. A statistical approach based on Bayes' rule was used to compare the models to the observations and obtain an estimate of the Young’s modulus (E) and Poisson’s ratio (v) in Iceland. The best-fitting models are those using a one-kilometer thick top layer with v=0.17 and E between 12.9-15.3 GPa underlain by a layer with v=0.25 and E from 67.3 to 81.9 GPa. Results demonstrate that InSAR data and finite element models can be used successfully to reproduce crustal deformation induced by ice mass variations at Icelandic ice caps.\nFig. 1: Interferograms spanning 1993 July 31 to 1995 June 19, showing the surge at Tungnaárjökull (Tu.), Skaftárjökull (Sk.) and Síðujökull (Sí.) outlet glaciers.

            "abstract": "We present POPSICLES simulation results covering the full Antarctic Ice Sheet and the Southern Ocean spanning the period 1990 to 2010. Simulations are performed at 0.1o (~5 km) ocean resolution and with adaptive ice-sheet model resolution as fine as 500 m. We compare time-averaged melt rates below a number of major ice shelves with those reported by Rignot et al. (2013) as well as other recent studies. We also present seasonal variability and decadal trends in submarine melting from several Antarctic regions. Finally, we explore the influence on basal melting and system dynamics resulting from two different choices of climate forcing: a “normal-year” climatology and the CORE v. 2 forcing data (Large and Yeager 2008).\nPOPSICLES couples the POP2x ocean model, a modified version of the Parallel Ocean Program (Smith and Gent, 2002), and the BISICLES ice-sheet model (Cornford et al., 2012). POP2x includes sub-ice-shelf circulation using partial top cells (Losch, 2008) and boundary layer physics following Holland and Jenkins (1999), Jenkins (2001), and Jenkins et al. (2010). Standalone POP2x output compares well with standard ice-ocean test cases (e.g., ISOMIP; Losch, 2008) and other continental-scale simulations and melt-rate observations (Kimura et al., 2013; Rignot et al., 2013). BISICLES makes use of adaptive mesh refinement and a 1st-order accurate momentum balance similar to the L1L2 model of Schoof and Hindmarsh (2009) to accurately model regions of dynamic complexity, such as ice streams, outlet glaciers, and grounding lines. Results of BISICLES simulations have compared favorably to comparable simulations with a Stokes momentum balance in both idealized tests (MISMIP-3D; Pattyn et al., 2013) and realistic configurations (Favier et al. 2014).\nA companion presentation, “Response of the Antarctic Ice Sheet to ocean forcing using the POPSICLES coupled ice sheet-ocean model” in session C024 covers the ice-sheet response to these melt rates in the coupled simulation.\nThe figure shows eddy activity in the vertically integrated (barotropic) velocity nearly six years into a POPSICLES simulation of the Antarctic region.",

Whistler mode chorus emissions consist of discrete wave packets which exhibit different spectral shapes. Rising tones (events with positive value of the frequency sweep rate) are frequently observed. Other categories of chorus spectral shapes, such as falling tones, hooks, broadband patterns, are also known. Whistler-mode emissions can additionally occur as hiss or combinations of hiss with discrete patterns.\nIn this study, we have analyzed more than 11 years of high-time resolution measurements provided by the Wideband Data (WBD) instrument onboard four Cluster spacecraft to identify different spectral shapes of whistler mode emissions. We determine the distribution of individual groups of chorus spectral shapes in the Earth's magnetosphere and the effect of the different geomagnetic conditions on their occurrence.

            "abstract": "Terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) is a major component for the land surface water cycle and the energy interaction between land surface and atmosphere, and for the improvement of understandings such as the terrestrial water management as well as vegetation growth. Satellite remote sensing provides a promising opportunity to quantify the magnitude and variability of ET at the regional scale. This study investigated the interannual variability of ET in Northeast Asian regions containing Korea Peninsula, China, Mongolia, and Japan. The regional daily ET was estimated using various satellite remote sensing data from 2003 to 2010. Satellite-based daily ET calculations showed generally favorable agreement (RMSE < 1.06 mm day-1) with eight flux tower measurements. Annual ET showed large range in study domain from 466 in 2006 to 498 mm yr-1 in 2008. The mean annual ET for study period was 481.1±224.6 mm yr-1 over the Northeast Asia. ET rates were generally higher at the cropland in China, while it was lower at the grassland in Mongolia. In general, large variability of annual ET was detected in central and northern China and eastern parts of Mongolia and Russia, which are dominated by Grassland, Savanna and Shrubland classifications as well as complex terrain. The range of coefficient of variation (CV) on annual ET was from 15 to 30% at those regions. The spatial pattern of CV was similar to the ratio of ET to TRMM precipitation (ET2PRCP) for the arid and semi-arid regions represented to grassland in this domain. CV on ET was generally high when the ET2PRCP was within the range from 0.7 to 1.5. It indicates that precipitation may affect to variation of annual ET at for the arid and semi-arid regions. The results generated by this study indicated that the satellite remote sensing provides the potentials to estimate and monitor ET at the regional scale, and offers a good chance to improve our knowledge on the land surface water balance.",

In these coeval sections, extremely low values (<0.7069; the lowest values of the Phanerozoic) continued from upper Wordian (middle Middle Permian) to the topmost Capitanian (upper Middle Permian) barren interval immediately below the Middle-Late Permian boundary characterized by the major crisis of large-tested fusulines and rugose corals.  Immediately after ca. 5 m.y.-long minimum interval, the major rise in 87Sr/86Sr was started and the rate of the rise (0.00007/m.y.) continued in period of time containing 21 m.y. until early Triassic (~239 Ma), that is faster than the Cenozoic major rise (0.00003/m.y.).　The most significant shift through Phanerozoic in Sr isotope trend can be explained by the remarkable changes in continental erosion/weathering rate; in particular, by the onset of glaciation and the following deglaciation, that is supported by global sea level change, in addition to the initial doming/rifting of Pangea. After the Capitanian cooling, the long-term climatic regime shifted to a warmer one during which inland ice sheet was removed to expose old crustal silicates for to erosion/weathering. A mantle plume impingiment might lead a domal uplift that accelerate weathering. Highly radiogenic continental Sr could enter the ocean along the new drainage systems developed with the rifting.",

However, satellite remote sensing studies have shown higher concentrations at the Equator, and earlier work has suggested possible biogenic sources. Here we present highly vertically-resolved atmospheric gradients of CCl4 within and above a primary rainforest ecosystem from three towers in the Central Amazon. The observed buildup of CCl4 mixing ratios near the top of the main canopies provides new evidence for a potentially large biogenic source from the Basin. By demonstrating the need to represent tropical forests as biogenic sources of CCl4, our study may help narrow the gap between remote sensing observations of CCl4 and emission, chemistry, and transport models and therefore lead to improved predictions of its role in atmospheric chemistry and climate.",

The goal of this study is to characterize the radar backscatter response of vegetation in response to natural variations in moisture availability. This is an essential step to determine if there is role for radar in the detection and monitoring of water stress in vegetation.\nThe SnowScat scatterometer was installed on a tower above a maize canopy in Flevoland in the Netherlands from July to September 2013. Snowscat is a ground-based, fully polarimetric, coherent stepped frequency continuous wave scatterometer operating in the range of 9-18GHz. Since 2009, it has been employed in several field campaigns in Switzerland and Finland to investigate the backscatter characteristics of snow. This study is its first deployment in an agricultural setting.\nBackscatter was measured hourly at a range of azimuth and elevation angles. Regular destructive vegetation sampling and dielectric property measurements are used to monitor variations in the canopy water content, dielectric properties, and canopy growth. Meteorological data, soil moisture and temperature profiles, canopy air temperature profiles and NDVI data were also collected. Results will be presented to show the influence of canopy growth, hydrometeorological conditions and the canopy moisture content distribution on the radar backscatter as a function of frequency, polarization and elevation angle.",

            "abstract": "The accommodation of deformation in the Earth’s lithosphere typically results in a heterogeneous distribution of strain in the continental crust, which is a function of effective pressure, temperature and strain rate at different structural levels. In Northeast Brazil, the Borborema Province is characterized by an interconnected, crustal-scale shear zone system associated with a widespread granitic plutonism. Two of the most prominent structures of this system, the Patos and Pernambuco shear zones, are characterized by ~ 600 km long E-W striking mylonite belts in which strain localization processes are observed either in association with partial melting in the Patos strike-slip fault, or as zones of overprinting brittle-ductile deformation in the Pernambuco shear zone. Deformation mechanisms are distinct across the Patos shear zone, mainly marked by crystalline plasticity and diffusion creep in the high-temperature northern border, magmatic flow in the central region and dislocation creep coupled with microfracturing in the southern sector. The Espinho Branco migmatite (~ 565 Ma) acts as a weak rheological layer that accumulates strain in the northern portion of the fault. Alternatively, the absence of partial melting and the dominant cataclastic/plastic flow regime lead to grain-size sensitive strain localization at the southern border. The Pernambuco shear zone was nucleated at the vicinities of two granitoid batholiths at c.a. 588 Ma. Low-temperature mylonites adjacent to the batholiths show several microstructures indicating coeval activity of brittle-ductile deformation. Recent zircon U-Pb (SHRIMP) data on these mylonites yielded mean ages of ~ 539 Ma, suggesting successive events of thermal input and shearing within the structure. These features suggest that strain localization processes exert an important control on the rheology of the continental lithosphere; the accommodation of deformation in the middle crust is mainly attained by the presence of weak rheological layers such as a melt phase, which localizes strain via diffusion creep. On the other hand, the upper crustal levels are characterized by strain accumulation along pre-existing planar anisotropies through brittle-plastic mechanisms, therefore localizing deformation at the frictional-viscous transition.",

After 1983, the warmest SST is shifted towards the central Pacific region during drought years.

            "abstract": "Igneous sills represent an important contribution to upper crustal magma transport, acting as magma conduits and stores (i.e. as sill networks, or as nascent magma chambers). Complex sill-network intrusion in basin settings can have significant impact on subsurface fluid flow (e.g., water aquifer and hydrocarbon systems), geothermal systems, the maturation of hydrocarbons, and methane release. Models for these effects are critically dependent on the models for sill emplacement. This study focuses on staircase-geometry sills in the Faroe Islands, on the European Atlantic Margin, which are hosted in mechanically layered lavas (1-20 m thick) and basaltic volcaniclastic units (1-30 m thick). The sills range from 20-50 m thick, with each covering ~17 km2, and transgressing a vertical range of ~480 m. Steps in the sills are elliptical in cross section, and discontinuous laterally, forming smooth transgressive ramps, hence are interpreted as representing initial stages of sill propagation as magma fingers, which inflate through time to create a through-going sheet. Although steps correspond to the position of some host rock layer interfaces and volcaniclastic horizons, most interfaces are bypassed. The overall geometry of the sills is consistent with ENE-WSW compression, and NNW-SSE extension, and stress anisotropy-induced transgression. Local morphology indicates that mechanical layering suppressed tensile stress ahead of the crack tip, leading to a switch in minimum and intermediate stress axes, facilitating lateral sill propagation as fingers, and resulting in a stepped transgressive geometry.",

            "abstract": "The solid inner core is the most remote and inaccessible part of our planet but its structure and composition may provide a key record needed to reveal the timing and nature of the onset of Earth’s protective magnetic field generated and even of long-term changes in the way the mantle convects driving surface dynamics. Key to developing our understanding of the inner core is our ability to use seismic observations to constrain its structure on all scales. Seismic wave velocities are mostly sensitive to the atomic scale crystal structure, temperature and composition. On a larger scale the microstructure of the inner core, reflecting its deformation and crystallization history, can be probed by seismic studies of elastic anisotropy and anelasticity [Makinen & Deuss (2013) Geophys. J. Int. 194:401]. The inner core is at temperatures in excess of ~0.95Tm and interpretation of the properties and history of the inner core must therefore include careful understanding of the anelastic properties of HCP iron and its alloys.\nThe most recent study of the anelasticity of iron and iron alloys is now over a decade old [Jackson et al., (2000) J. Geophys. Res. 105:23605] and is limited to low pressure where iron adopts the body centered cubic (BCC) or face centered cubic (FCC) structure. It is now widely, although not universally, accepted that iron in the core adopts the hexagonally close packed (HCP) epsilon-iron structure stable above 10 GPa and there are currently no results that reveal the anelasticity of this core-forming phase.\nWe have used Zinc as a low pressure analogue for HCP-iron and measured its anelastic response as a function of frequency (periods 10-300s), temperature and pressure (P<7GPa). Our experiments use the D-DIA to apply a sinusoidally varying strain to the sample and a corundum elastic standard. We image changes in length of the sample and standard in response to the driving strain X-radiographically. The amplitude and phase of sample length change relative to that of the elastic standard gives us the effective Young’s modulus (amplitude) and internal friction (frequency dependent phase lag). Above ~0.7Tm, we observe significant reduction in the sample’s effective Young’s modulus and an increase in internal friction; both of these are frequency dependent.",

            "abstract": "Catalogs of earthquakes located using differential travel-time techniques are a core product of volcano observatories, and while vital, they represent an incomplete perspective of volcanic seismicity. Many (often most) earthquakes are too small to locate accurately, and are omitted from available catalogs. Low frequency events, tremor and signals related to rockfalls, pyroclastic flows and lahars are not systematically catalogued, and yet from a hazard management perspective are exceedingly important. Because STA/LTA detection schemes break down in the presence of high amplitude tremor, swarms or dome collapses, catalogs may suggest low seismicity when seismicity peaks.\nWe propose to develop a workflow and underlying software toolbox that can be applied to near-real-time and offline waveform data to produce comprehensive catalogs of volcanic seismicity. Existing tools to detect and locate phaseless signals will be adapted to fit within this framework. For this proof of concept the toolbox will be developed in MATLAB, extending the existing GISMO toolbox (an object-oriented MATLAB toolbox for seismic data analysis). Existing database schemas such as the CSS 3.0 will need to be extended to describe this wider range of volcano-seismic signals. WOVOdat may already incorporate many of the additional tables needed. Thus our framework may act as an interface between volcano observatories (or campaign-style research projects) and WOVOdat.\nWe aim to take the further step of reducing volcano-seismic catalogs to sets of continuous metrics that are useful for recognizing data trends, and for feeding alarm systems and forecasting techniques. Previous experience has shown that frequency index, peak frequency, mean frequency, mean event rate, median event rate, and cumulative magnitude (or energy) are potentially useful metrics to generate for all catalogs at a 1-minute sample rate (directly comparable with RSAM and similar metrics derived from continuous data). Our framework includes tools to plot these metrics in a consistent manner. We work with data from unrest at Redoubt volcano and Soufriere Hills volcano to develop our framework.",

            "abstract": "Incomplete mixing of reactive solutes is well known to slow down reaction rates relative to what would be expected from assuming perfect mixing. As reactions progress in a system and deplete reactant concentrations, initial fluctuations in the concentrations of reactions can be amplified relative to mean background concentrations and lead to spatial segregation of reactants. As the system evolves, in the absence of sufficient mixing, this segregation will increase, leading to a persistence of incomplete mixing that fundamentally changes the effective rate at which overall reactions will progress. On the other hand, non-uniform fluid flows are known to affect mixing between interacting solutes. Thus a natural question arises: Can non-uniform flows sufficiently enhance mixing to suppress incomplete mixing effects, and if so, under what conditions? In this work we address this question by considering one of the simplest possible flows, a laminar pure shear flow, which is known to significantly enhance mixing relative to diffusion alone. To study this system we adapt a novel Lagrangian particle-based random walk method, originally designed to simulate reactions in purely diffusive systems, to the case of advection and diffusion in a shear flow. To interpret the results we develop a semi-analytical solution, by proposing a closure approximation that aims to capture the effect of incomplete mixing. The results obtained via the Lagrangian model and the semi-analytical solutions consistently highlight that if shear effects in the system are not sufficiently strong, incomplete mixing effects initially similar to purely diffusive systems will occur, slowing down the overall reaction rate. Then, at some later time, dependent on the strength of the shear, the system will return to behaving as if it were well-mixed, but represented by a reduced effective reaction rate. If shear effects are sufficiently strong, the incomplete mixing regime never emerges and the system can behave as well-mixed at all times.",

            "abstract": "The northeastern Brazilian, tropical coast-shelf system along the Atlantic Ocean is a sediment-starved zone, because of low relief, small drainage basins, and a semiarid climate. This work presents the major results of a study of environmental changes, particularly those related to Holocene sea-level rise, affecting the coast and shallow waters of Rio Grande do Norte (RN) State, NE Brazil. The methods included bottom-sediment characterization, bioindicator tracking, and integrated shallow-water geophysical investigation. This coastline is marked by active sea cliffs carved into tablelands alternating with reef- or dune-barrier sections, beach rocks and lagoons, whereas the shelf is a narrow, very shallow, and highly energetic system. Overall, the area is under the natural influence of tides (with a semidiurnal mesotidal regime) and the anthropogenic influence of salt exploration, oil industry, shrimp farms, tourism, and wind-farms. Sedimentation during the Holocene has been controlled mainly by sea-level variation, longshore currents, and the advance and westward propagation of active dunes along the coast. As in other areas around the world, growing numbers of permanent and seasonal residents choose to live at or near the ocean. Coastal erosion is a cause for concern along many Brazilian beaches, and several erosion hot spots are already recognized in RN State. Curves of Holocene relative sea-level variation were established for RN State, but the absence of long-term oceanographic observations in the last centuries or that of detailed altimetry maps hinders the evaluation of different risk scenarios at the local level. Nevertheless, impacts of the current sea-level rise and human activity can be observed along the RN coastal-shelf system. Particular aspects of the study, such as oil-spill monitoring, coastal-water sewage contamination, and coastal erosion, will be highlighted.",

            "abstract": "Collapsed terrains have been observed using Viking images in the northern part of Arabia Terra from Ismenius Lacus to Deuteronilus Mensae. Recent interpretations of some of these depressions as explosive volcanoes (Michalski and Bleacher, 2013) have renewed the interest for this region. However, recent observations also show the discovery in this region of a series of outflow channels named Okavango Valles (Mangold and Howard, 2013). These channels formed in the Hesperian through catastrophic flows having deposited sediments as deltas in ephemeral lakes. The source area of these channels takes place in a region of widespread depressions and local collapse pits. A continuum of landforms exists from broad depressions (~100 km in length and 100s m in depth) and sharper collapse structures (<100 km in diameter). Given the link between these depressions and the presence of outflow channels, we interpret the collapse structures as resulting from a specific lithology with volatile-rich sediments (or megaregolith) buried at depth. Collapse may be due either to the melting of subsurface ice, or subsurface flows triggered by a change in the groundwater table, or the (less likely) dissolution of buried chemical sediments. Magmatic activity is not excluded: a regionally enhanced thermal flux during the Hesperian could have triggered ground ice melting, and could have initiated subsidence subsequently, but explosive volcanism at the surface is not necessary to explain the presence of large collapsed terrains.\nMichalski, J. and J.

            "abstract": "Subglacial geology provides important controls on the onset and maintenance of fast glacial flow in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). Widespread subglacial sediments deposited within deep rift basins, thinner drapes of marine sediments within the West Antarctic Rift System (WARS) and high geothermal heat flux associated with Cenozoic magmatism have been previously identified as key geological controls that can modulate ice sheet dynamics.\nHere, we compile a suite of new and vintage aeromagnetic and airborne gravity observations to examine the large-scale geological setting of several major ice streams flowing into the Weddell Sea Embayment and assess the role of geological controls on subglacial topography and WAIS flow regimes. We focus on the subglacial geology beneath the Institute and Moeller ice streams, the Rutford ice stream and the Evans ice stream. We show that the Moeller ice stream is underlain by a major strike-slip fault system, which is part of the tectonic boundary between East and West Antarctica. A set of en-echelon subglacial basins formed along the strike-slip fault and these basins appear to steer enhanced flow far inland. Deep sedimentary basins are not present along this fault system, however, suggesting that subglacial sediments are not necessarily a geological template for the onset of fast glacial flow. The recently identified Robin Subglacial Basin that underlies the fast flowing coastal region of the Institute ice stream contains 1-3 km of sedimentary infill and smooth bedrock topography. Enhanced flow in the tributaries of the Institute ice stream cuts across the Ellsworth Mountains and is controlled by basement faults displacing metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks.\nProminent magnetic anomalies overlie outcrops of Jurassic granitic intrusions and enable us to trace their subglacial extent beneath the catchments of Institute, Moeller and Rutford ice streams. These large granitoid bodies form topographic highs that appear to divert fast flow around them. Magnetic anomalies also delineate the extent of Precambrian basement that underlies a significant part of the Evans ice stream catchment. Narrow rifts developed the edges of this uplifted Precambrian block, and exert significant controls on fast flow in the Evans and Rutford ice streams.",

Morpho-dynamic terrain of Himalaya is continually facing challenges in stability of rock/slopes, which are aggravated due to increased disturbance level in rock/soil mass due to human intervention. The lithological and structural variations, orientations and patterns of different water bodies and vegetation are varied along the slopes which indicate site-specific studies of rock fall prone areas in Uttarakhand. Lack of sufficient knowledge and understanding of the phenomenon, frequent occurrences of rock fall along state and national highways, the consequent inconveniences and loss of lives highlight the importance of addressing the subject on a priority basis.\nRock fall simulation of the hill cut face along state highway in India was performed to replicate the effects of the falling rock blocks in the valley. The energy, velocity, bounce height and the trajectory of possible rock failures were determined. The slopes were optimised with respect to the intermediate benches to reduce the impact of falling rock blocks on the adjoining road. It was observed that introducing benches near the top did not reduce the impact of falling boulders much, however, the number of rocks crossing the ditch was less. On the contrary, benches at intermediate height reduced the energy of falling blocks but could not restrict the blocks to cross over the ditch on to the road. An optimisation of the angle of inclination of the ditch angle was also carried out. A ditch angle of 15o could restrict the passage of boulders from ditch over to the adjoining road. The study will be very useful for safe design of structures for prevention and mitigation of hazards due to rock failures along these slopes.",

            "abstract": "Bioindicators are biological processes, species or communities, which are used to assess changes in the environment or environmental quality. Theoretically, they could also be used to provide advanced warning of hazards. They are inexpensive, locally relevant, and can encourage stakeholder participation in early warning system development and maintenance. While bioindicators have been identified for environmental problems such as air pollution and water pollution, and have been used to assess health of ecosystems, little information is available on bioindicators for climate related hazards. This presentation reviews possible biodindicators for droughts, wildfires and tropical cyclones, based on the results of a literature review. It will also present results from a household survey of 36 communities in Kenya, Ghana and Burkina Faso. Indigenous knowledge offers a wealth of potential bioindicators; including animal and insect behavior, and plant phenology. Yet significant study is needed to verify these indicators and evaluate them against criteria such as specificity, variability, monotonicity, practicality and relevance. Bioindicators may not be specific to individual hazards and may provide limited advanced warning, as response often occurs after the actual onset of the hazard. Furthermore, indicators may become increasingly unreliable due to climate change itself. There is a need for a large-scale assessment of hazard bioindicators, which should also include forecasts of bioindicator change under global warming, and a cost-benefit analysis of the value of integrating bioindicators into early warning systems. Lessons can be drawn from ethnopharmacology. Coordinated research on this topic could contribute to the resilience of both ecosystems and human livelihoods.",

            "abstract": "Landslides are a major geohazard, which result in significant human, infrastructure, and economic losses. Landslide susceptibility mapping can help communities to plan and prepare for these damaging events. Mapping landslide susceptible locations using GIS and remote sensing techniques is gaining popularity in the past three decades. These efforts use a wide variety of procedures and consider a wide range of factors. Unfortunately, each study is often completed differently and independently of others. Further, the quality of the datasets used varies in terms of source, data collection, and generation, which can propagate errors or inconsistencies into the resulting output maps. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has proved to have higher accuracy in representing the continuous topographic surface, which can help minimize this uncertainty. The primary objectives of this paper are to investigate the applicability and performance of terrain factors in landslide hazard mapping, determine if LiDAR-derived datasets (slope, slope roughness, terrain roughness, stream power index and compound topographic index) can be used for predictive mapping without data representing other common landslide conditioning factors, and evaluate the differences in landslide susceptibility mapping using widely-used statistical approaches. The aforementioned factors were used to produce landslide susceptibility maps for a 140 km2 study area in northwest Oregon using six representative techniques: frequency ratio, weights of evidence, logistic regression, discriminant analysis, artificial neural network, and support vector machine. Most notably, the research showed an advantage in selecting fewer critical conditioning factors. The most reliable factors all could be derived from a single LiDAR DEM, reducing the need for laborious and costly data gathering. Most of the six techniques showed similar statistical results; however, ANN showed less accuracy for predictive mapping.\nKeywords : LiDAR, Landslides, Oregon, Inventory, Hazard",

            "abstract": "Freshwater input to the Godthåbsfjord (Southwest Greenland) is analyzed with special attention on the melt and runoff from the ice sheet. We use the high resolution (5.5 km) HIRHAM5 regional climate model covering all of Greenland, forced by the ERA-Interim reanalysis at the lateral boundaries over the period 1989-2012.\nThe horizontal model resolution (5.5 km) allows a high degree of detail in the representation of topography and surface types. This makes the model particularly suited for local catchment-scale analysis. The model output is compared to a range of different hydro-meteorological observations both on and off the ice sheet and is found to represent weather variability well.\nDuring this period, the ice sheet up to elevations of 2000 m experienced increasing energy input from the surface turbulent heat flux and the ice sheet above 1000 m experienced increasing energy input due to shortwave radiation. Large-scale trends show an increase in atmospheric pressure over North Greenland, southerly wind anomalies and declining cloudiness. These factors contributed to increased summer melt, which outweighed changes in annual accumulation, resulting in a decline in surface mass balance (SMB) and upward migration of the equilibrium line of more than 100 m. The associated increase in runoff to Godthåbsfjord dominates over changes in precipitation directly over the fjord and surface runoff from non-glacier land.\nRegressing simulated SMB on observed temperature and precipitation, we reconstruct SMB back to 1955. In this 58-year perspective, the recent SMB changes are found to be unprecedented. While low SMB has occurred before, this has previously been driven by low precipitation. The current low SMB, on the other hand, is driven by increased melting.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic climate change has resulted in an increase in sea surface temperature (SST) of 0.1oC per decade from 1971-2010. Satellite data reveals that Southern Belize has experienced greater temperature increases of up to 0.9oC from 1982 to 2009. Recent investigations have demonstrated that this warming has had a negative impact on coral calcification [1,2]. Instrumental temperature records in this region prior to 2002 are sparse, and the coarse spatial resolution of the satellite temperature data from 1982 to 2009 present problems when comparing changes in SST to rates of coral calcification. This makes it necessary to reconstruct past ocean temperatures indirectly to more accurately assess the impact of SST changes on coral calcification.\nThe trace element composition of coral skeletons has been widely used in palaeothermometery, based on the assumption that the incorporation of trace elements such as Li, Mg and Sr (expressed as a ratio to Ca) is temperature dependent. In this study, we investigate the elemental composition of two samples sets (i) Siderastrea siderea coral samples cultured at controlled temperatures and pH, and (ii) annual and monthly resolved field samples of S. siderea measured across three major reef zones.\nTo explore the optimum method for SST reconstruction in this species, the widely used Sr/Ca temperature proxy is compared with the more recently described Li/Mg proxy [3,4]. We demonstrate that Li/Mg appears to be the most reliable temperature proxy, with a well-defined correlation with temperature such that it is able to provide more precise temperature reconstructions than the traditional Sr/Ca approach. The results of this study pave the way to using Li/Mg in S. siderea as a reliable palaeothermometer to further our understanding of the response of Caribbean reef systems to climate change.\n[1] Castillo et al., 2011.

            "abstract": "The hydrologic response of Alpine catchments embeds the geomorphologic signature of the dominant drivers influencing snowmelt runoff dynamics. The focus of this work is the role of aspect as the main control on incoming radiation. We investigate the link between hillslope aspects and discharge generation for a study catchment in the Swiss Alps, coupling a physical model for the simulation of snowmelt to an hydrologic response model accounting for geomorphology. Incoming radiation and topographical shading are explicitly accounted for in the computation of the snowpack energy balance at the local scale. The role of aspects is analyzed through virtual experiments where the coupled model is applied to rotations of the reference DEM. The distributed simulation results for each of these virtual experiments show that the hourly discharge during the snowmelt period exhibits a visible geomorphologic signature of aspects at sub-catchment scale, but this progressively fades out going from headwater streams to the outlet. Accordingly, the geomorphologic signature is scale-dependent: it is significant at small scales where the high aspect correlation generates predominant orientations but is lost at larger scales where aspects are de-correlated and different orientations are averaged out. The de-correlation of aspects is in fact a typical feature of Alpine regions, as suggested by the asymptotic flattening of the variograms computed for 4 selected Swiss catchments. The scale-dependence of the geomorphologic signature on snowmelt runoff explains why temperature-index snow models are effective in simulating the dynamics of snow accumulation and melting at catchment scale.",

            "abstract": "Large uncertainties preside over terrestrial carbon flux estimates on a global scale. In particular, the strongly coupled dynamics between net ecosystem productivity and disturbance C losses are poorly constrained. To gain an improved understanding of ecosystem C dynamics from regional to global scale, we apply a Markov Chain Monte Carlo based model-data-fusion approach into the CArbon DAta-MOdel fraMework (CARDAMOM). We assimilate MODIS LAI and burned area, plant-trait data, and use the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) and maps of above ground biomass as prior knowledge for initial conditions. We optimize model parameters based on (a) globally spanning observations and (b) ecological and dynamic constraints that force single parameter values and parameter inter-dependencies to be representative of real world processes.\nWe determine the spatial and temporal dynamics of major terrestrial C fluxes and model parameter values on a global scale (GPP = 123 +/- 8 Pg C yr-1 & NEE = -1.8 +/- 2.7 Pg C yr-1). We further show that the incorporation of disturbance fluxes, and accounting for their instantaneous or delayed effect, is of critical importance in constraining global C cycle dynamics, particularly in the tropics. In a higher resolution case study centred on the Amazon Basin we show how fires not only trigger large instantaneous emissions of burned matter, but also how they are responsible for a sustained reduction of up to 50% in plant uptake following the depletion of biomass stocks. The combination of these two fire-induced effects leads to a 1 g C m-2 d-1reduction in the strength of the net terrestrial carbon sink.\nThrough our simulations at regional and global scale, we advocate the need to assimilate disturbance metrics in global terrestrial carbon cycle models to bridge the gap between globally spanning terrestrial carbon cycle data and the full dynamics of the ecosystem C cycle. Disturbances are especially important because their quick occurrence may have long-term effects on ecosystems. Our synthetic simulations show that while tropical ecosystems uptake may reach pre-disturbance level after a decade, biomass stocks would most likely need more than a century to recover from a single extreme disturbance event.",

            "abstract": "The SE margin of the Tibetan Plateau is characterized by a long-wavelength, low-gradient topography over 1500 km distance. Most representative of the diffuse margin is the Three Rivers region, where the Mekong, Salween and Yangtze flow nearly in parallel for hundreds of kilometers. Low relief surfaces perch high and between deeply incised river valleys, a unique geomorphic feature on Earth. The process and mechanism of its genesis are debated. Models of plateau deformation make contrasting predictions in regional surface uplift and the corresponding response of river incision. we utilize apatite and zircon U-Th/He and apatite fission track thermochronology to map regional spatial-temporal pattern of exhumation and river incision. We sample five vertical transects at different locations along the margin, in order to determine whether there is a difference in the initiation time of the latest stage of denudation, which may provide a test to conceptual models of Tibetan plateau margin development. Preliminary results show that there is large north-south difference in timing of the phase of fast exhumation. The northernmost transect (~29.5°N) shows a sustained fast exhumation of ~250 m/Myr since ca. 40 Ma, middle transect (~28.5°N) records a phase of fast exhumation (120 m/Myr) at 50±10 Ma, followed by a slight slowing-down exhumation since 40Ma. The southern profiles (~26.5°N) is characterized by a pulse of very fast exhumation at ca. 15±5 Ma, followed by a slowing-down in exhumation to ~140 m/Myr. The profile on a tributary of Jinsha (27.5°N ) is an exception with a sustain slow exhumation (<30 m/Myr) since Late Cretaceous. Common to all locations is a slowing-down in exhumation rate since late Miocene, albeit a north-south difference in timing of commencement. Our data also suggest an eastward decreasing gradient in latest-stage exhumation rate: samples on tributaries of Salween suggest a larger exhumation rate than those on Mekong, which in turn larger than on Yangtze. Since Salween is incising deeper than Mekong, which in turn deeper than Jinsha at the same latitude, we suggest that trunk river incision may drive hillslope denudation, and that the pattern has maintained over Myr- time scale. We will also discuss the implications of our data to tectonic models of SE Tibetan plateau margin development.",

The main purpose of this presentation is to investigate the predicted relation between g-dot and u-dot in previously glaciated areas with the aim to determine if such a relation can provide additional insight to the physics of this process and also improved constraints on model parameters. We use the normal mode approach for one dimensional earth models and solutions of the sea level equation with time-dependent coastline geometry.\nNumerical predictions of g-dot and u-dot are computed for Laurentia, Fennoscandia and the British Isles respectively, using six different earth models. Within each region a linear trend is then fitted using the relation g-dot = C · u-dot + g0-dot. Estimated values of C and g0-dot differ more between the regions than between different earth models within each region. For Fennoscandia, C ≈ 0.163 µGal/mm and for Laurentia C ≈ 0.152 µGal/mm. Maximum residuals between the linear trend and spatially varying model predictions of are 0.04 µGal/yr in Fennoscandia and 0.17 µGal/yr in Laurentia. For the British Isles the results are harder to interpret, mainly since this region is located on the zero uplift isoline of Fennoscandia. In addition, we study the temporal variation of the relation since the last glacial maximum till present-day.\nThe temporal and spatial variation of the relation between g-dot and u-dot can be explained by (i) the elastic and viscous proportions of the total signal and (ii) the spectral composition of the regional signal. Additional local effects, such as the Newtonian attraction and elastic deformation from local sea level changes, are examined in a case study for six stations in the Nordic absolute gravity network. The influence of these local effects on the relation between g-dot and u-dot is negligible except for extreme locations close to the sea.",

            "abstract": "Thermal plasma particles in a magnetic field have a magnetic moment due to Lorentz force. The magnetic moment is anti-parallel to the field direction (diamagnetic) and is inversely proportional to the field strength. It does not disappear even under highly collisional condition. The magnetic flux density (or magnetic field, B) in a magnetized media is determined as B = μ0(H+M), where μ0 is the magnetic permeability of the vacuum, H is the magnetic intensity, and M is the magnetic moment per unit volume. This means that the magnetic field in a plasma is a self-consistent field (B is a function of B itself) and has some restrictions. Under high plasma beta condition, this restriction results in spontaneous formation of magnetic flux tubes. Hence, in the solar convection zone where the gas pressure is high, the magnetic field can exists as concentrated flux tubes. Plasma particles inside and outside the tube are rather independent even in a low ionization degree plasma due to frequent collisions. Plasma particles inside the flux tube are pushed upwards along the field due to the diamagnetic moment (mirror force) against the gravity force. The hot coronal plasma can be supplied directly from below through magnetic flux tubes. Coronal heating and other important questions can be understood by this simple mechanism.",

Traditionally,\nE\nS\nhas been obtained by multiplying mean stress drop and seismic moment divided by the rigidity by assuming the distribution of stress drop is constant in space, which yields an elliptic slip distribution. It has, however, been pointed out that slip distributions are approximated not as the elliptic distribution but as the\nk\n-squared model (Herrero & Bernard 1994 BSSA), so that the product of mean stress drop and seismic moment does not give proper estimation of\nE\nS\n.\nFor the case of heterogeneous stress drop, the inner product requires shorter wavelength components of slip distribution (Andrews 1980 JGR). Mai & Beroza (2002 JGR) revealed that observed slip distributions in the wavenumber domain are well modeled with the von Karman power spectrum density parameterized by a corner wavenumber\nk\nc\nand the Hurst exponent\nH\n, and quantified these two parameters for some inversion results.

            "abstract": "The breakup of Gondwana translated Madagascar southwards relative to Africa along the Davie Fracture Zone (DFZ). This fracture zone now forms the Transform Passive Continental Margin (TPCM) from Kenya to Mozambique. The Davie Ridge (DR), a transform marginal ridge, has formed along the DFZ between 5 and 2°S and 22 and 11°S, but with little expression in-between. It has been proposed that this marginal ridge was formed by the thermal effects of a passing Mid Ocean Ridge (MOR) during the separation of Gondwana. Plate kinematic reconstructions, however, constrained by ocean magnetic anomalies, show that the MOR only passed between the north and south expressions of the DR. Therefore the positive linear gravity anomalies of the DR cannot be attributed to the effects of a passing MOR, and some other mechanism must be found to explain their formation.\nInterpretation of seismic reflection profiles along the DR shows that the gravity highs occur adjacent to large basin structures. In the north this correlates with a basin-bounding basement high of ~Albian age, and in the south with the rift flank uplifts of the currently active Quirimbas graben. This suggests that the northern and southern DR segments are instead shoulder uplifts resulting from two separate extensional episodes during different stress regimes. These are the Cretaceous NE-SW extension during the breakup of the south Atlantic, and the E-W extension of the Neogene-recent Afar-East Africa rift system, respectfully. The lack of deformation and DR formation along the region of the TPCM passed by the MOR suggests it has been coupled by thermal effects and/or the injection of magma.",

            "abstract": "The high topographic of the Andes has been resulted from the long-lasting and ongoing convergence between Nazca and South America plates. The build-up of the high topographic Andes does not only have reduced the convergent rate in the long-term but may have also influenced the short-term patterns of seismicity. The high mountains and the west flank of the Northern Chile is experiencing shallow and deep seismicity, with notable along-strike variations. Motivated by these considerations, we integrate modeling of Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE) and Global Positioning System (GPS) observations to investigate the control of the topography on the seismicity distribution. In this attempt, it is hypothesized that shallow seismicity is strongly influenced by the GPE in the range per unit area (1.45 -1.66) x1014 N/m due to high topography. By calculating the deviatoric stress associated with GPE and strain rate from GPS velocities, we obtain depth integrated value of stress for the full thickness of the lithosphere and the state of the stress in the upper crust and seismogenic plate contact. The GPE field in combination with GPS derived strain rates are used to sketch the present deformation pattern in the northern Chile Andes in regard of the crustal seismicity. The results indicate that high GPE gradient exhibits significant relationships with the shallow earthquake activity in the region. Therefore region of large topographic, where earthquakes have not occurred in past years, may be considered as potentially seismic hazards. Therefore high GPE gradient factors should be considered in the studies of earthquake activity and seismic hazard estimation.",

            "abstract": "Most rivers draining the Raukumara Range of New Zealand's East Cape are subject to episodic sediment deliveries by transient landsliding and debris flows. The landscape is underlain by relatively weak lithologies, and has been subject to forest clearing in the past. There are a few notably large (>40 ha) and long-lived (chronic) gully complexes that significantly impact trunk channels with varying but persistent additions of gravel and sand at the decadal scale. This leads to channel widening, discontinuities in grain-size trends, and accelerated valley-filling downstream: the transport equilibrium within the trunk channel is typically reset beyond this confluence zone. The study area thus offers good scope for improving our understanding of the nature of channel coupling with major lateral sediment sources, and the balance of possible morphologic and textural responses to sediment loading over decades.\nUsing three case studies from the Waiapu and Raukokore valleys, we use photogrammetry and field surveys to assess geomorphic coupling between chronic landslides and rivers, and consider the explanatory power of variables such as relative sediment loads, relative grain size differential, and the geometry of the tributary confluence, including channel slopes and the confinement of valley walls. The addition of sand and friable gravel material from landslides and gullies leads to augmented transport capacity and pronounced fining. Trunk channel slope moderates the buildup or evacuation of sediment storage in confluence fans and bars. The major valleys downstream are the ultimate buffers for these large sediment loads before delivery to the Pacific, changing the configuration of their storage zones over decades. By studying this exceptionally active landscape, we derive important insights into changes in channel sediment regime.",

SGLI has the features, such as 17-channel from near ultraviolet to thermal infrared, 250-m spatial resolution, polarization, and multi-angle (nadir and ±45-deg. along-track slant) observation. In the GCOM-C/SGLI land science team, LAI is scheduled to be generated from GCOM-C/SGLI observation data as a standard product (daily 250-m). In extisting algorithms, LAI is estimated by the reverse analysis of vegetation radiative transfer models (RTMs) using multi-spectral and mono-angle observation data. Here, understory layer in vegetation RTMs is assumed by plane parallel (green leaves + soil) which set up arbitrary understroy LAI. However, actual understory consists of various elements, such as green leaves, dead leaves, branches, soil, and snow. Therefore, if understory in vegetation RTMs differs from reality, it will cause an error of LAI to estimate. This report describes an algorithm which estimates LAI in consideration of the influence of understory using GCOM-C/SGLI multi-spectral and multi-angle observation data.",

Although radiocarbon evidence for a deglacial rise in deep Pacific ventilation so far remains conflicting, this may stem in part from surface reservoir age uncertainties and their effect on inferred deep ocean ventilation ages.\nHere we use chronostratigraphic calendar age constraints to estimate surface reservoir age variability, and therefore deep ventilation ages, in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific over the last 25 kyr. Both the shallow- and deep ventilation records show a deglacial decrease in glacial radiocarbon depletion, consistent with other South Pacific and Southern Ocean ventilation reconstructions where surface reservoir ages have been assessed. We propose that this basin-wide agreement can be explained by ocean interior transport pathways similar to the modern, implying significantly reduced air-sea gas exchange in the southern high latitudes during the last glacial period.",

Therefore, in the framework of this study an automatic determination of the moment magnitude was performed by using the displacement spectra of selected earthquakes in Marmara Region. For this purpose 39 three component broadband stations from KOERI seismic network which recorded 174 earthquakes with magnitudes 2.5≤M≤5.0 in between 2006-2009 were used.\nDue to the importance of quality factor in determination of the moment magnitude with spectral analysis method, the quality factor was calculated for the whole region in the beginning. Source spectrum which was obtained by converting the velocity records to displacement spectra and moment magnitudes of earthquakes were determined by fitting this spectrum to classical Brune model. For this aim, an automatic procedure was utilized which based on minimizing the differences between observed and synthetic source spectra identified by the S-waves. Besides of moment magnitude and location parameters, some source parameters such as seismic moment, spectral level, corner frequency and stress drop were also calculated. Application of the method proves that determine the seismic moment from the source spectra is applicable not only for earthquakes with small magnitude but also moderate earthquakes as well.",

            "abstract": "Preferential flow paths can have a huge impact on the amount and time of runoff generation, particularly in areas where subsurface flow dominates this process. In order to simulate preferential flow mechanisms, many different approaches have been suggested. However, the efficiency of such approaches are rarely investigated in a predictive sense. The main reason is that the models which are used to simulate preferential flows require many parameters. This can lead to a dramatic increase of model run times, especially in the context of highly nonlinear models which themselves are demanding. We attempted in this research to simulate the daily recharge values of a weighing lysimeter, including preferential flows, with the 3-D physically based model HydroGeoSphere. To accomplish that, we used the matrix pore concept with varying hydraulic conductivities within the lysimeter to represent heterogeneity. It was assumed that spatially correlated heterogeneity is the main driver of triggering preferential flow paths. In order to capture the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity values we used pilot points and geostatistical model structures. Since hydraulic conductivity values at each pilot point are functioning as parameters, the model is a highly parameterized one. Due to this fact, we used the robust and newly developed method of null space Monte Carlo for analyzing the uncertainty of the model outputs. Results of the uncertainty analysis show that the method of pilot points is reliable in order to represent preferential flow paths.",

Many observations have been provided by the WIND spacecraft and by the Cluster mission for which wave-particle interaction has been extensively studied. More recently, with the magnetic field observations from Venus Express, an abundance of quasi-monochromatic ULF waves (with frequency below and far enough from the local proton cyclotron frequency) have been identified by an automatic survey upstream from the Venusian bow shock. One objective of this study was first to derive the relative occurrence of such foreshock waves and proton cyclotron waves associated to local pickup ions linked to exospheric hydrogen previously reported upstream from the Venusian shock. The second objective was to compare with the observed properties of the similar ULF waves in the terrestrial foreshock and discuss their association with ion distributions. The transverse part of the power spectrum dominates the parallel part for the reported Venusian foreshock ULF waves. Most of the waves display left-hand polarization in the spacecraft frame. Taking into account the Doppler-shift by the high-speed solar wind, they may be right-hand polarized in the solar wind frame. These characteristics suggest that they are RH mode waves generated by a cyclotron resonant process in the ion foreshock region by the field aligned beam protons reflected at the shock as in the terrestrial case.",

We performed measurements of teleseismic shear wave splitting using SKS and SKKS phases and receiver function analyses to characterize the nature and thickness of the crust and the underlying upper mantle structure. Seismic anisotropy is observed at all seismic stations and display a rather homogeneous pattern: average values of the splitting parameters show fast polarization trending between N112°E (EURO) and N120°E (JNOV) to N81°E (MAYO). Observed delay times vary between 0.8 (JNOV) and 1.0 s (MAYO). In Mayotte, analysis of individual backazimuthal variation of splitting parameters suggests an upper mantle more complex than a single anisotropic layer. Station TROM located on Tromelin Island shows similar fast polarization azimuth of N123°E but slightly higher delay time (1.4 s). Fast polarization directions are compared with values predicted by drag-induced anisotropy and absolute plate motion direction and with lithospheric fossil spreading directions. Results are also compared to orientation predicted by large-scale mantle convection models. Receiver functions observations and modelling of P-to-S conversions at the Mohorovičić (Moho) discontinuity have been employed to investigate the variations in the Moho depth, the nature of the crust and of the crust-mantle transition. Preliminary results suggest a Moho depth of 16 km beneath Europa Island.",

            "abstract": "The IUGONET (Inter-university Upper atmosphere Global Observation NETwork) is a data system which connects the distributed databases at 4 Japanese universities and one national institution by means of a common metadata database. The main purpose of the IUGONET is to promote the Solat-Terrestrial science with various ground based observations. On the other hand, the combination of ground based observation with satellite observations is essential to analyze the complex Solar-Terrestrial system. It is often necessary to use the globally distributed database which the IUGONET does not include. Therefore we need to extend the system to include the satellite data and to promote interoperability with other data system in other countries such as the ESPAS (Near Earth space data infrastructure for e-science) and the VOs (NASA/Virtual Observatories). In this paper, we introduce a proposal of extension of the IUGONET to include the satellite data and to increase the interoperability with other data systems in Europe and America.",

            "abstract": "Iron is a primary component of planetary cores and the cores are believed to contain a certain amount of light elements. Carbon is one of the most plausible light elements in the cores. The dynamic process in the liqiuid core (e.g. dynamo) is closely related to physical properties of liquid iron alloys (density, viscosity, and etc.). Although the physical properties of the liquid iron alloys are considered to correlate highly with those local structures, the knowledge about the correlations between the physical properties and the local structures for the liquid iron alloys is still lacking. In this work, we have carried out the structural measurements for liquid Fe-C alloys up to 7.2 GPa using multi-angle energy-dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDXD) technique with a Paris-Edinburg type large volume press at the Sector 16-BM-B beamline at the Advanced Photon Source.\nThe collected EDXD data shows that the first peak positions of the structure factor S(Q) of liquid Fe-3.5 wt% C and its reduced pair distribution function G(r) are almost constant below 5 GPa, whereas those change with pressure above 5 GPa (S(Q) increases and G(r) decreases). Since the relative scattering factor of carbon atoms is approximately 50 times smaller than that of iron atoms due to small atomic number of carbon (Boronenkov et al., 2012), we considered that the obtained S(Q) and G(r) are basically related to the Fe-Fe bond in the liquid Fe-C alloy. Therefore, these pressure-dependences indicate that the Fe-Fe bond distance in liquid Fe-3.5 wt% C is constant below 5 GPa and then shortens with increasing pressure at least up to 7.2 GPa. The observed change at 5 GPa is in a good agreement with the observed density jump by Shimoyama et al. (2013) at same pressure, indicating that the density jump could result from shortening of the Fe-Fe bond at about 5 GPa.",

            "abstract": "The existence of axial magma chambers (AMC) is indicative of the magmatic crustal accretion at Mid-Ocean Ridges. They have been extensively imaged with seismic reflection data (e.g. multichannel seismic data), showing that the depth of the top reflector increases from 1 km to ~3 km below the seafloor, when the spreading rate decreases from fast to slow spreading. Under the ultraslow spreading environment, we have previously reported the discovery of a large lower-crustal low-velocity zone at the Southwest Indian Ridge at 50°28'E from 3-D travel time tomography of refraction data registered by an ocean bottom seismometer (OBS) array. These results suggest the presence of partial melt within the lower crust (>4 km bsf).\nHere we further improve the resolution of the AMC image by employing a 2-D time-domain elastic full waveform inversion (FWI) method. The FWI gives a higher resolution than travel time tomography as it utilizes amplitude information and does not require the high-frequency approximation used in travel time tomography. The non-linearity of the FWI is overcome by using the tomographic results as a starting model. We have selected a 70-km long profile running across the ridge axis around the segment center, where 340 shots spaced at ~220 m were recorded on 3 OBSs. The small number of OBS poses serious challenge for the success of the full waveform inversionFWI. In order to examine the resolvability of this sparse OBS dataset, we first performed FWI over a sparse synthetic data set. We find that the FWI of these this sparse dataset is capable of retrieving an isolated lower-crustal AMC anomaly beneath the ridge axis, although the resulting velocity anomaly is smeared out, particularly along the lateral direction. For the real-data inversion, the starting model was built from the 3-D travel time tomography. The inverted results clearly show the sharp boundary of the top of the low velocity zone, suggesting that the low velocity zone indeed corresponds to the crustal AMC.",

If the return period of t-year precipitation, t, is greater than the data size (number of data of time series of annual maxima), then we use a traditional parametric method by which some probability distributions are used and goodness-of-fit results are mutually compared. The criterion of goodness-of-fit that we used is the Takara–Takasao criterion (1988). The criterion is designated as the standard least squares criterion (SLSC) in Japan. We designate this case as a ‘case for a few samples’. However, if the number of data of time series of annual maxima is greater than the return period t, then the case is that for numerous samples. For the case, we used Takara’s method (2006), which uses a nonparametric probability distribution.\nFor both cases for a few samples and for numerous samples, the bootstrap method is applied to ascertain the variation of the estimated t-year precipitation obtained using the parametric or nonparametric probability distribution we chose. We emphasize that Monte-Carlo-like simulations are not necessary for the case with numerous samples: a theoretical solution exists for the bootstrap method. We show the theoretical solutions. Furthermore, the data we used are solutions obtained using CGCM (KAKUSHIN-5 km data). Therefore, data with very high spatial resolution of 5 km can be used. Even if sparsely distributed precipitation data are used, high-resolution data can be obtained using CGCM data.",

            "abstract": "Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), designed for measuring velocity profile, is now widely used for the estimation of suspended sediment concentration from acoustic backscatter intensity, but its application to estuarine environments has not been vigorously tested. In this study, we examined the inversion capability of two ADCPs with 600 and 1200 kHz at three Korean estuaries: macrotidal Han river estuary (HRE), microtidal Nakdong river estuary (NRE), and anthropogenically altered macrotidal Yeongsan river estuary (YRE). In particular, we examined the relative importance of the sound attenuations due to water (aw) and sediment (as) in response to sediment characteristics (size and concentration) as well as changing salinity and temperature. The inverted concentration was compared with reference concentrations obtained either water samples or Optical Backscatter Sensors. In NRE and YRE, where suspended sediment concentrations were smaller than 0.2 kg/m3, the acoustic inversion performed poorly only with as (R2 = 0.05 and 0.39 for NRE and YRE, respectively), but well with aw (R2 = 0.70 and 0.64 for NRE and YRE, respectively). Thus, it is important to accurately constrain aw in low-concentration estuarine environments. However, we did not find that the varying aw performed considerably better than the constant aw. On the other hand, the acoustic inversion was poorest at HRE regardless of aw and as (R2 = 0.58 and mean relative error =45%). The large discrepancy appears to result from the poorly constrained, spatially and temporally varying sediment characteristics (grain size, density and concentration) due to non-local sediment transport at macrotidal HRE.",

            "abstract": "Pattern-scaled (PS) and emulated climate data are derived from climate model projections in order to offer a more comprehensive, though approximate, representation of uncertainties in future climate. These data are widely used by analysts studying climate change impacts, adaptation and mitigation, often in the form of \"scenario generator\" tools. Some of the advantages they provide include: rapid and flexible access to climate projections; representation of a range of uncertainties in projections, including multiple radiative forcings, time periods, variables and regional patterns; and (in some cases) access to probabilistic projections. They also present challenges to analysts, including: access to projections consistent with forcing levels not provided from climate models; selection of a manageable sample of projections; determination of a reference or baseline climate; issues around downscaling of projections; representation of future changes in climate variability at different scales; provision of variables other than temperature and precipitation; ensuring internal consistency between variables being projected; and consideration of climate projections alongside other uncertainties (such as socioeconomic futures and impact model projections).   In view of these advantages and challenges, and mindful of the potential needs of impact analysts affecting the design of forthcoming CMIP6 climate model simulation runs, this presentation offers some user perspectives on the kinds of data and information that may be required in the coming decades. The main messages have been developed out of discussions around this theme in a Workshop held at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, Co in April 2014. In brief, some basic needs to be explored include: (1) evaluation of the PS/emulation techniques using formal statistical techniques, (2) compilation and critical evaluation of tools applying PS and emulation to scenario provision, (3) guidance on the use of PS/emulated outputs (and in the context of the new RCP/SSP global scenarios framework), and (4) examples of good practice application. Finally, some possible next steps for the research community will be suggested.",

            "abstract": "Coastal geomorphology is highly variable as it is affected by sea-level changes and other naturally- and human-induced fluctuations. To effectively assess and monitor geomorphological changes in various time scales is thus critical for coastal management. Asian mega deltas are vulnerable to a sea-level rise due to its low-lying delta plain, and are dynamic region given a large amount of sediment supply. However, limited data availability and accessibility in the deltas have prevented establishment of systematic coastal monitoring. A variety of remote sensing systems can be used to monitor geomorphological changes in coastal areas as it has wide spatial coverage and high temporal repeatability. Especially, analysis using SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data not affected by the cloud conditions offer potential for monitoring in the monsoon Asia region.\nWe will present some case studies of Asian coastal regions using L-band SAR data, ALOS (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) PALSAR (Phased Array type L-band SAR) and JERS-1 (Japanese Earth Resource Satellite-1) SAR data. One example is that time-series of radar amplitude images can be used to delineate changes quantitatively of the areal extent of river-mouth bars in distributaries of the Mekong River delta. It shows that the estimated areas of river mouthbars gradually increase on an annual time scale, and seasonal variations of areas were also recognized. Another example is that differential SAR interferometry is applied to the coast of the Yellow River delta in China. It shows very high subsidence rates, likely due to groundwater pumping. A further example is that we apply a SAR interferometry time series analysis to monitor ground deformations in the lower Chao Phraya delta plain, Thailand. A single reference time series interferogram from the stacking of unwrapped phases were applied. The subsidence and uplift pattern observed using the SAR interferometry time series analysis highlights the spatial complexity. Longer-term continuous monitoring with future SAR missions, such as ALOS-2, will provide us with more opportunities for new insights into coastal monitoring.",

            "abstract": "Recently, it is generally believed that the increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) emission has become a major contributing factor of a global warming. Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is an emerging technology and considered as the promising method to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. Generally, CCS is intended to apply in oil or natural gas reservoir layers with overlying cap rock. However, in Japan, few proper sites are available for CCS. Therefore, low-permeable rock mass without cap rock is suggested as alternative option. It is required to clarify behavior of CO2 in rock for longitudinal and stable storage of CO2.\nIn order to clarify the properties of permeability and storativity of low permeable rocks, Ainoura sandstone, saturated with water injected with a constant and appropriate flow rate of supercritical CO2, flow pump permeability test under the condition of temperature and pressure of in-situ CO2 reservoir has been conducted. In this experiment, the differential pressure between both ends of specimen changed in 4 stages and finally in stable condition. Furthermore, relative permeability of water and CO2, and specific storage of specimen during CO2 injection has been calculated with theoretical analysis of flow pump permeability test for two phase flow. Using the results of the experiment, 3D core-scale flow-simulation by using TOUGH2 (ECO2N module) has been conducted due to confirm the flow of fluid and CO2 distribution in the specimen. To compare the results of simulation and experimental results, the permeability and storativity properties of carbon dioxide in low permeable rock has been estimated. As a result, low permeable rocks could become an effective storage of supercritical CO2.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol particles influence the Earth’s radiation budget by interacting with the incoming sunlight. The chemical composition and size of aerosol particles determine their potential to scatter and absorb radiation as well as their capability to take up water (Zieger et al., 2011). If particles are hygroscopic their optical properties will be altered at enhanced relative humidities (RH) due to the increase in size and change in index of refraction. It is known that RH but also the chemical composition of aerosols change with altitude (Morgan et al., 2010) which makes it very important to investigate optical properties at different heights. Within the Pan-European Gas-Aerosols-climate interaction Study (PEGASOS) a set of instruments was installed on a Zeppelin to investigate changes of light scattering and absorption in the planetary boundary layer. In order to obtain the scattering properties, Mie calculations were performed for size distributions recorded with SMPS (scanning mobility particle sizer) and WELAS (optical size spectrometer). The index of refraction and the hygroscopicity of the aerosol particles were measured with the white-light humidified optical particle spectrometer (WHOPS). These measurements further allowed studying the RH-dependence of the optical properties. Moreover, a seven wavelength portable aethalometer was employed to determine the light absorption properties of the aerosol. In this work we will present vertical profiles of scattering and absorption coefficients measured during Zeppelin flights of the PEGASOS campaigns in Italy in 2012. Additionally comparisons with ground based measurements from nephelometers and aethalometers, as well as remote sensing results will be shown.\nW.T.

            "abstract": "Reliable information about the hydrological behaviour of an ungauged catchment is needed for a wide range of water-resource management purposes, and it has been a central topic of research in hydrology for the last decade through the Predictions in Ungauged Basins initiative. Such information derived from observed data is known as a hydrological signature, and has been used in a variety of studies for, e.g., change detection, catchment classification, and model calibration. When signature values are predicted for ungauged catchments, they are not only affected by uncertainties in the observational data for the gauged catchments used for the prediction, but also by uncertainties in the regionalisation procedure.\nIn this study we investigated a method for regionalisation of hydrological signatures to ungauged catchments that accounted for both of these uncertainty sources. This also enabled us to assess the role of the different uncertainty sources in defining the overall regionalisation uncertainty – e.g. for what signatures and conditions are the observational uncertainties more important than the regionalisation uncertainties and vice versa?\nThe study was made using an extensive dataset of catchments in England and Wales, incorporating gauging (stage-discharge) data from all the discharge stations. The uncertainties were assessed within a Monte Carlo framework that incorporated different types of uncertainties in the data as well as uncertainties in the regionalisation procedure.",

The remote sensing instrument VIRTIS, composed of two channels –M for mapping and –H for high resolution has observed intensively both the nucleus and the coma environment, in the 0.3-5 microns wavelength domain. In addition to nucleus mapping observations, many observations sequences are dedicated to the coma, in order to get IR spectra of gas and dust.\nDust thermal emission should affect IR coma spectra by adding a continuum over which gas emission lines are detected. Depending on the amount of silicates or ices that compose the dust grains, absorption bands can also be detected in IR spectra. The dust infrared emission depends both on the size distribution of the grains and their chemical composition. We will present initial guesses of the dust thermal emission using simple thermal models, and we will compare them to the VIRTIS-H and –M spectra obtained since July 2014.\nAuthors acknowledge the funding from CNES French and ASI Italian Space Agencies.",

            "abstract": "Developing, or choosing, appropriate climate projections for use in a particular context is challenging. To help with this, it is useful to distinguish between two types of climate projection information. First there is scientific knowledge about the range of plausible climate change. Such knowledge can synthesise a range of relevant evidence, may convey messages in qualitative terms only, and may also have attached confidence (e.g. as in IPCC assessments).This knowledge can be used in context setting but may also be sufficient information for qualitative impact applications aimed at narrative development. Secondly, there are projection data sets tailored for use in technical risk assessments. Although these two products draw on similar source material (primarily global and regional climate model output), the information they can contain about future climate can be quite different. Often in meeting user needs, only a subset of the range of plausible future climate is considered in application-ready products. This may be due to user needs for downscaled information which comes from limited models, or their need to work with a small number of multivariate scenarios which are best provided by the outputs of single climate models. In the push to create sophisticated datasets that meet demanding technical needs, the larger perspective of representativeness can go by the wayside, and there is a risk that data users will tacitly believe their data are representative of future change when in fact they may not be. Thus a key challenge for risk assessment is for projection providers and users to work in unison to ensure that the two aspects of knowledge and data are as harmonised as possible. These concepts will be illustrated using projection products from the Australian context, including a range of new national climate projection products developed recently to support applications in natural resources management planning.",

To this end, the Collaboratory for the Study of Earthquake Predictability (CSEP) is conducting a retrospective evaluation of over a dozen short-term forecasting models that were developed by groups in New Zealand, Europe and the US. The statistical model group includes variants of the Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model, non-parametric kernel smoothing models, and the Short-Term Earthquake Probabilities (STEP) model. The physics-based model group includes variants of the Coulomb stress triggering hypothesis, which are embedded either in Dieterich’s (1994) rate-state formulation or in statistical Omori-Utsu clustering formulations (hybrid models). The goals of the CSEP evaluation are to improve our understanding of the physical mechanisms governing earthquake triggering, to improve short-term earthquake forecasting models and time-dependent hazard assessment for the Canterbury area, and to understand the influence of poor-quality, real-time data on the skill of operational (real-time) forecasts. To assess the latter, we use the earthquake catalog data that the NZ CSEP Testing Center archived in near real-time during the earthquake sequence and compare the predictive skill of models using the archived data as input with the skill attained using the best available data today. We present results of the retrospective model comparison and discuss implications for operational earthquake forecasting.",

Integrating digital core analysis and conventional measurements in a way that measurements are made on the same scale allows a direct comparison of experiment and numerical simulation. If boundary conditions for both experiments are matched and measurements agree, the solution of the numerical problem provides additional insights by considering categorical variables, over which field variables might be averaged. The approach is illustrated by full scale calculations on reservoir core plugs, targeting permeability as function of stress conditions, quantifying the contribution of micro-porosity to relative permeability, and by local analysis of NMR responses with applications to rock typing.",

The existing design criteria are decided by calculating the probable rainfall quantile through the frequency analysis. However, the actual rainfall record length at a point is usually shorter than desired return period. Therefore, in order to calculate the reliable design rainfall, the regional frequency analysis has been performed. In this study, a regional rainfall frequency analysis of the FORGEX (FOcused Rainfall Growth EXtension) method was applied to estimate the extreme rainfall quantiles, longer than 200 years of return period, by using the annual maximum rainfall data in Korea. The FORGEX method was adopted to make up for the problem the existing regional frequency analysis had contained the uncertainty for long return period. The DDF curves were derived by using data of 61 sites from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA). Moreover, the quantiles of FORGEX method were compared with the estimation extreme rainfall of At-site method and Index-flood method. In order to resolve the uncertainty problem of long return period, the need of research about the FORGEX method was confirmed.",

            "abstract": "Sahara has experienced during its long geological history a large number of climatic changes from humid conditions (with savanna-type environments) to dry conditions (with hot desert environments). Therefore, since the late Miocene (?), Sahara experienced periods with rivers, lakes, deltas, and swamps alternated with dry periods with strong aeolian activity and the formation of deflation surface and sand seas. The fluvio-lacustrine deposits formed during humid periods have been strongly reworked by wind processes during the dry periods leaving only the coarse-grained portion of the sediments (conglomerate to rudite). This highly efficient reworking eeolian mechanism affected both of the fluvial and deltaic channel deposits and the large inland lakes, flood plains and other waterlogged areas. The former occurs, at present day, as morphological features and coarse-grained remnants of large fluvial systems whereas the latter are mostly buried below sand seas such as Grand Erg Oriental, Erg Chech, and Azawad. While the sand to silt material accumulated (mostly by saltation) in the sand seas and sand sheets, the finer portion (able to enter the wind as suspended material) was probably swallowed in the large- scale atmospheric circulation redistributed in Sahara itself, in adjacent continents (mostly Europe and South America), and oceans. This geological setting is similar to the one of Mars where fluvial deposits and morphologies abound as largely eroded discontinuous remains. Large-scale alluvial basins and terminal lakes or waterlogged areas (such as the allucial plain in Zephyria) have been largely present in the Martian Noachian-Hesperian time (and possibly even later) but relatively scanty sedimentary deposits testify their existence. When deposits are present they are basically coarse-grained (e.g. the meandering channels of the Eberswalde deltaic plain) due to the long lasting aeolian erosion similarly than the Sahara example. The wind, that dominated the long depositional history, accumulated sand to silt sediment in sand seas while the finer portion as draping dust. The analogy with the Sahara is compelling and provides a clue on the environmental variability of Mars and clearfy that alternating cliamte chsnges modify the environments and the habitability potential.",

            "abstract": "Exploratory one-line coastal models have been used to investigate the formation and evolution of coastal geomorphic features developed on sandy coasts, and are often applied by engineers for coastline management. Existing one-line models discretise the coast in a Cartesian coordinate system, limiting the evolution of the coastline to the cardinal directions, inhibiting some models from handling complex coastal geometries with high plan-form curvature. We developed a vector-based one-line model using local shoreline coordinates in order to evolve complex coastline geometries more effectively, including islands. The vector-based approach aids model efficiency whilst allowing complex coastal forms such as headland bay beaches, spits, sand waves and islands to be modelled. The coastline is discretised into polygonal, trapezoid or triangular cells depending on the coastline geometry being considered and the shoreface evolves normal to the local shoreline configuration. As in existing one-line models, changes in shoreline position are driven by gradients in alongshore sediment flux, calculated as a function of breaking wave conditions and integrated across the shoreface depth (in this case using the CERC equation). Waves are transformed following Airy wave theory, assuming that depth contours are locally shore-parallel. Additional rules for refraction and diffraction in the shadow of headlands or coastal structures have also been incorporated. We demonstrate the model’s potential by applying it to the development of concave and convex shoreline features. In particular we focus on the formation and evolution of headland bay beaches in the lee of headlands or sea defences, exploring the influence of varying offshore wave climates on emergent morphologically steady crenulate bay forms. We compare numerical modelling results to predictions of empirical models for the equilibrium form of crenulate bays as well as examples from nature.",

            "abstract": "While high-density seismic streaks are commonly seen in aftershocks of a strike-slip earthquake, significant linear clusters in background seismicity are rare. A typical example of such sustained streaks is observed along the creeping section of the San Andreas fault, in which strain localization associated with frictional heterogeneity takes a responsibility. Here we show other examples from Tamba and Wakayama regions, around Osaka-Kyoto district, where a number of several-to-20-km-long seismic streaks are observed. We explore the role of geologic heterogeneity into the seismicity comparing spatial distribution of earthquakes with geologic structure in both regions, where a significant high background rate of seismicity has been continuously recorded since the mid-1900. Epicenters of numerous small earthquakes are located mainly on the Mesozoic metamorphic rocks and Mesozoic-Paleozoic accretion units, whereas low seismicity is characterized in granite and ultra-mafic rocks. Within the Wakayama seismic zone, in particular, we observe many E-W and ENE-WSW trending dense seismic clusters in hypocenters of Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) data relocated with the hypo DD algorithm of Waldhauser and Ellsworth (2000). Most of the E-W trending seismic clusters possibly correspond to the E-W trending local scale geologic faults, folds, bedding planes, and schistosity. However, well-determined fault plane solutions by JMA and the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED) show NS-trending reverse faults corresponding to EW compression. We further sought the focal mechanisms for smaller earthquakes using waveform data recorded in the SATARN seismic network system of DPRI, Kyoto University. As a result, among the many reverse fault mechanisms, we found some amounts of strike-slip ones, which may associate with the visible EW-trending seismic clusters.",

In Eastern Africa, grasslands of Echinochloa stagnina are primordial for pastoralists as highly productive dry-season grazing zones. Regular flooding is a critical property in maintaining their productivity and resulting services. Yet, construction of hydrologic infrastructure modifies the flooding regime of rivers and the consequences on downstream floodplain grasslands need to be assessed.\nThis presentation focuses on quantifying the productivity of the floodplain grasslands in the Tana River Delta, Kenya, in order to assess potential changes under varying flooding regimes. The interactions between growth and floods are explored firstly at an experimental site, then through the construction of a process-based plant growth model adapted to floodplain grasslands. The 15-month experiment consisted in quantifying daily growth rates under various rainfall, irrigation, cutting and flooding regimes . Floods increased growth rates three-folds, and high productivities were maintained after the floods. The cutting regime and contribution of non-flood water also influenced productivity. Modelling allowed exploring the underlying processes explaining such behaviour. In an exploratory endeavour, the productivity of the grassland at the ecosystem scale was assessed with the model for a variety of flood and non-flooded scenarios. Decreasing floods led to a drop in annual productivity that could have serious consequences for the livestock keeping activities of the zone.\nThis research highlights the importance of floods in the maintenance of high productivities for a floodplain grassland typical of East Africa, and maybe of the Sahelian band. The model, once further validated, could be used on other floodplain grasslands, such as those of the Niger delta. Results for the Tana River Delta would need to be discussed with the stakeholders so that proper action can be taken.",

This very low fluctuation activity is consistent with the fluctuations being part of the ambient turbulent spectrum known as the \"great power law in the sky\". The range of wavenumbers included in the Voyager study includes waves that are expected to be generated by unstable pickup ion distributions that are believed to be the parent population of the energetic neutral atoms making up the IBEX ribbon. The absence of fluctuations have important implications for the models that rely on the presence of turbulence to scatter the ions. The talk will discuss the evolution of ring-beam distributions produced from multiple primary ENA populations generated directly from the Alabama neutral atom transport model. Results for the excitation of waves and the scattering of ions initially\ninjected at angles ranging from 90 degrees to the magnetic field angle at Voyager 1 will be presented.",

            "abstract": "We assess tsunami hazards in New Zealand through a review of historical accounts, analysis of water level and current speed data and detailed numerical modeling. The tsunamis of 2010 (Chile) and 2011 (Japan) were recorded on tide gauges throughout New Zealand, providing a rich water level data set for model comparison and calibration. Furthermore, a current meter at the entrance to Tauranga Harbor also captured these tsunamis providing a unique current speed data set augmented by several concurrent water level records. Analysis of the current data from 2011 shows that although port operations were not adversely affected, tsunami currents may have exceeded thresholds for the navigation of large vessels through the narrow harbor entrance. Harmonic analysis of the current speed data also illustrates the effect of tidal flows on tsunami currents. This information was then used to calibrate numerical models using the ComMIT modeling tool. A sensitivity study for tsunamis generated from around the Pacific Rim indicates the relative hazards from different source regions. Deterministic scenario modeling of significant historical tsunamis provides a quantitative estimate of the expected effects from possible future great earthquakes. These models were tested in April 2014 after the Mw 8.2 earthquake offshore of Iquique, Chile – an event of particular concern given that the August 1868 Arica earthquake generated a tsunami of ~7 m in Lyttelton Harbor as well as runup of up to 10 m in the Chatham Islands. As the April 2014 event unfolded, it was initially unclear if an evacuation or other emergency response would be necessary in New Zealand given that a tsunami was observed and recorded on tide gauges and deep ocean tsunameters close to the source region. Models run in real time, using sources based on inverted tsunameter data and finite fault solutions of the earthquake, suggested that a damaging far-field tsunami was not expected. As a result, emergency response teams and port authorities were advised that is was safe to stand down. These results were ultimately confirmed when the tsunami was recorded in Lyttelton Harbor with a maximum amplitude of ~15 cm. Nevertheless, this event reminded us of New Zealand’s far-field tsunami exposure as well as the hazard from sources in South America and the Peru/Chile border region in particular.",

            "abstract": "The shallow subsurfaces of solar system bodies can hold important clues to their evolution, including their physical properties and the structure of buried geological features. Exploration of these regions can provide insight into possible habitable zones by revealing layering, discontinuities and the lateral variability of sedimentary materials. We propose a novel type of scientific instrument for studying shallow subsurfaces that uses radio communication systems on planetary missions to perform two types of investigations:\n1) Bistatic radar measurements in which Earth-based radio antennas transmit a signal that is received by an existing radio communication antenna/receiver on a spacecraft. The receiver would detect interference patterns that are formed by the combination of direct signals from the Earth and signals scattered from the surface and subsurface. This measurement is sensitive to the dielectric properties of the subsurface materials and buried stratifications caused by past aqueous and non-aqueous processes.\n2) Passive microwave radiometry measurements with the same onboard antenna/receiver to measure the lateral and temporal variations of ground brightness temperature. For example, temporal changes in ground temperature can identify the thermal inertia of subsurface material.\nSuch measurements could provide detailed information on the subsurface and geological context for surface measurements and sample collection. They could also motivate further investigations of interesting areas by other onboard instruments. We envision this type of instrument becoming a common feature on many future missions, perhaps with the scientific instrument functions built into the communication systems, thus providing key science at minimal additional cost and mass.",

            "abstract": "The tiny moon Pallene (diameter < 5 km, semi-major axis 212,000 km) orbits between Saturn's moons Mimas and Enceladus. The ISS cameras on board the Cassini spacecraft have detected a faint dust torus along its inclined orbit (Hedman, 2009). The source of the torus is believed to be the moon itself, where dust particles are ejected from the surface by micrometeoroid bombardment.\nHere we present in-situ dust measurements of the Cosmic Dust Analyser (CDA) on-board the spacecraft Cassini which confirm a dust torus of micrometer-sized particles along the orbit of Pallene. The cross-section of the torus has been modeled with a double-Gaussian distribution, resulting in a radial and vertical full width at half maximum of 2300 km and 270 km and a maximum particle density of n = 2.7 10-3 m-3. Additionally, the data show an enhancement of larger particle in the torus in comparison to the background E-ring size distribution.\nThe radial mean position of the torus is radially shifted outwards by around 1200 km in all flybys. This could point to a systematic larger semi-major axes of the dust particles (in comparison to Pallene) or a possible heliotropic appearance of the torus (all flybys in anti-solar direction).",

            "abstract": "The knowledge of coupled processes controlling the spreading and fate of metals in non-acidic river systems is currently much more limited than the knowledge of metal behavior under acidic conditions (e.g., in acid mine drainage systems). Critical geochemical controls governing metal speciation may thus differ substantially between acidic and non-acidic hydrological systems. We here aim at expanding the knowledge of metals in non-acidic river systems, by considering a high pH river, influenced by mining by the largest gold mining area in the Mongolian part of the transboundary Lake Baikal drainage basin. The combined impact of geochemical and hydrological processes is investigated, to be able to understand the solubility of various heavy metals, their partitioning between particulate and dissolved phase and its impact on overall transport. We show, through site specific measurements and a geochemical modelling approach, that the combined effects of precipitation of ferrihydrite and gibbsite and associated sorption complexes of several metals can explain the high impact of suspended transport relative to total transport often seen under non-acidic conditions. Our results also identifies the phosphate mineral Hydroxyapatite as a potential key sorption site for many metals, which has both site specific and general relevance for metal partitioning under non-acidic conditions. However, an adsorption database, which is currently unavailable for hydroxyapatite, needs to be developed for appropriate sorption quantification. Furthermore, Cd, Fe, Pb and Zn were particularly sensitive to increasing DOC concentrations, which increased the solubility of these metals due to metal-organic complexation. Modeling the sensitivity to changes in geochemical parameters showed that decreasing pH and increasing DOC concentrations in downstream regions would increase the dissolution and hence the toxicity and bioavailability of many pollutants of concern in the downstream ecosystem. In general, this study suggests that in non-acidic hydrological systems, both seasonality of DOC concentrations (which could vary by several 100%), changing DOC concentrations (resulting from climate and land use changes) and potential phosphate solids can majorly influence on the spreading and toxicity of several metals.",

            "abstract": "Monitoring Suspended Solid Material (SSM) concentration in coastal areas is important because of its impact on water quality, especially in terms of phytoplankton and benthic algae productivity that decrease as a consequence of the reduction in the photic depth associated to increases of SSM concentrations. Remote sensing techniques have already demonstrated their potential in supporting, at least, traditional in situ methodologies for SSM measurements. Data acquired in the Visible – Near Infrared spectral region (VNIR) of the electromagnetic spectrum have been generally used for this application, exploiting the spectral behaviour of clear/turbid water. One still open challenge is the low sensitivity of these methodologies in shallow waters where discriminating the SSM contribution from the sea bottom one is not trivial. Another problem of EO-based techniques is that, being often calibrated at local scale, their exportability at global scale is generally difficult.\nIn this paper, the Robust Satellite Technique (RST) has been applied for monitoring SSM concentration variations in different Mediterranean coastal areas by using VNIR MODIS data. Thanks to the natural RST independence on the investigated signal as well as on the analyzed area, such a technique can be more easily exported at a global scale than other traditional EO methods. In addition, being a differential approach, RST automatically allows us to discriminate just the contribution of reflectance due to the sea bottom, previously characterized through the multi-temporal analysis, providing a reliable detection of SSM variation. In this paper, some RST-based SSM products developed in the framework of the projects IOSMOS (IOnian Sea water quality MOnitoring by Satellite data, OP ERDF Basilicata), MOMEDAS (MOnitoraggio delle acque del mar MEditerraneo mediante DAti Satellitari, OP Basilicata SRF) and RITMARE (La Ricerca Italiana per il Mare, CNR-MIUR), will be described.",

            "abstract": "There have been few studies on the horizontal flux of energy associated with mesoscale eddies and Rossby eddies. (Many studies in the past decade are on either energy conversions or the flux-divergence of eddy energy). This is partly attributed to the fact that, in general, the pressure flux in the traditional eddy energy equation does not look in the direction of the group velocity of Rossby waves. This has been a limitation in the understanding of the maintenance mechanism of the extension of western boundary currents (WBCs). The present study has developed a new eddy energy equation which (is independent of the quasi-geostrophic approximation but) allows us to diagnose the horizontal flux of eddy / wave energy with retaining the direction of the group velocity of a wide-array of Rossby-wave types. The types of Rossby waves include that are associated with both pure and equivalent beta effects, namely variants of Rossby waves concerning the horizontal gradient of (i) planetary vorticity, (ii) relative vorticity associated with mean currents (which is as in atmospheric dynamics), and (iii) the background stratification (which is associated with the slope of thermocline and yields an effect similar to topographic Rossby waves). A diagnosis of an idealised experiment shows that, in the regions of the extension of WBCs, the effects (ii) and (iii) prevail over the effect (i) to yield the eastward flux of eddy / wave energy. The result is that the total westward flux of eddy / wave energy by an array of Rossby-wave types may sometimes cancel out the eastward flux of eddy / wave energy owing to advection by mean currents in the extension regions.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have suggested that global mean surface temperature would remain approximately constant on multi-century timescales after CO2 emissions are stopped. These studies suggest that the cooling effect of reduction in radiative forcing due to the decrease in atmospheric CO2 is roughly balanced by the warming effect of reduction in ocean heat uptake.\nHere we use Earth system model simulations of such a stoppage to demonstrate that in some models, surface temperature may actually increase on multi-century timescales after an initial century-long decrease. For example, global mean surface temperature may increase by 0.6°C after carbon emissions are stopped at 2°C above preindustrial. Surprisingly, the temperature increase occurs in spite of a decline in radiative forcing that exceeds the decline in ocean heat uptake—a circumstance that would otherwise be expected to lead to a decline in global temperature. The reason is that the warming effect of decreasing ocean heat uptake together with feedback effects arising in response to the geographic structure of ocean heat uptake overcompensates the cooling effect of decreasing atmospheric CO2 on multi-century timescales in these models. We show that ocean heat uptake, which occurs preferentially at subpolar latitudes, has a larger temperature impact per watt per square meter than the CO2 radiative forcing. In other words, the cooling effect of a high-latitude heat sink is larger than that of an equivalent tropical heat sink.\nThe implications of our results for estimates of allowable carbon emissions required to remain below a specific global warming target will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "We report the high-speed (3,200 fps) observation of a bipolar cloud-to-ground flash with one first positive stroke followed by three subsequent negative strokes that all transferred charge to ground through the same channel. The inception of this flash was barely captured with the high-speed camera, indicating an onset near the cloud base, which allows us to investigate the possible mechanism for its occurrence. The examination of multi-disciplinary data recorded for this event, including high-speed imagery, slow and fast E-field change, broadband (3-300 kHz) magnetic fields, and surface static electric field, indicates that this flash could have initiated from a relatively large positive charge center near the cloud base (which caused a sustained negative surface electric field at the observation site); the preliminary breakdown pulse train has the same polarity as the pulse of leading positive return stroke. The positive leader propagated downward at an average speed of 1×105 m s-1, culminating a positive stroke with a continuing current of ~70 ms about 120 ms after the flash onset. The ascendance of upward negative leaders into the middle negative cloud charge region, as stimulated by a sequence of K processes that drew negative charge elsewhere at the cloud base, probably resulted in the polarity reversal of charge transfer to ground.",

            "abstract": "The 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami is commonly called a mega-tsunami, and this attribute has also been linked to the 2011 Tohoku-oki tsunami. However, since this term was first coined in the early 1990’s there have been very few attempts to define it. As such it has been applied in a rather arbitrary fashion to a number of tsunami characteristics, such as wave height or amplitude at both the source and at distant locations, run-up height, geographical extent and impact. The first use of the term is related to a tsunami generated by a large bolide impact and indeed it seems entirely appropriate that the term should be used for such rare events on geological timescales. However, probably as a result of media-driven hyperbole, scientists have used this term at least twice in the last decade, which is hardly a significant portion of the geological timescale. It therefore seems reasonable to suggest that these recent unexpectedly large events do not fall in the category of mega-tsunami but into a category of exceptional events within historical experience and local perspective. The use of the term mega-tsunami over the past 14 years is discussed and a definition is provided that marks the relative uniqueness of these events and a new term, appropriately Japanese in origin, namely that of souteigai-tsunami, is proposed. Examples of these tsunamis will be provided.",

            "abstract": "Mechanism on the uplift and deformation of the eastern margin of the Tibetan plateau is still debated, partly due to lack of a high-resolution 3-D seismic image of the crust and upper mantle beneath this region. We took advantage of the unprecedented station coverage and utilized empirical Green’s functions of Rayleigh waves extracted from 2-year ambient noise data of the vertical recordings. We started from a 3-D Vsv model produced by traditional ambient noise tomography [Yang et al., 2012] and implemented the traveltime adjoint tomography to iteratively update the initial model and finally approached a 3-D Vsv model with higher velocity contrast. In this process, with the aid of the highly accurate spectral element method (SEM), we employed 3D frequency dependent kernels that fully account lateral heterogeneities when investigating the Rayleigh wave dispersive property. Our preliminary result reveals a prominent low Vsv layer at depths ~20-40 km beneath the plateau. We interpreted it as inflated middle crust, which may have been squeezed to the margin from the center of the plateau. The mantle Vsv at ~80 km beneath the plateau appears to be significantly low, which might imply a thin lithosphere beneath the margin.",

            "abstract": "Increased bank stability by riparian vegetation in braided rivers can decrease bed reworking rates and focus the flow. The magnitude of influence and resulting channel morphology are functions of vegetation strength vs. channel dynamics, a concept encapsulated in a dimensionless ratio between timescales for vegetation growth and channel reworking known as T*. We investigate this relationship in an aggrading braided river at Mount Pinatubo, Philippines, and compare results to numerical and physical models. Gradual reductions in post-eruption sediment loads have reduced bed reworking rates, allowing vegetation to persist year-round and impact channel dynamics on the Pasig-Potrero and Sacobia Rivers. From 2009-2011, we collected data detailing vegetation extent, type, density, and root strength. Incorporating these data into RipRoot and BSTEM models shows cohesion due to roots increased from zero in unvegetated conditions to >10.2 kPa in densely-growing grasses. Field-based parameters were incorporated into a cellular model comparing vegetation growth and sediment mobility effects on braided channel dynamics. The model shows that both low sediment mobility and high vegetation strength lead to less active systems, reflecting trends observed in the field. An estimated T* between 0.8 – 2.3 for the Pasig-Potrero River suggests channels were mobile enough to maintain the braidplain width clear of vegetation and even experience slight gains in area through annual removal of existing vegetation. However, persistent vegetation focused flow and thus aggradation over the unvegetated fraction of braidplain, leading to an aggradational imbalance and transition to a more avulsive state. While physical models predict continued narrowing of the active braidplain as T* declines, the future trajectory of channel-vegetation interactions at Pinatubo as sedimentation rates decline appears more complicated due to strong seasonal variability in precipitation and sediment loads. By 2011, seasonal incision in the dry season had started to occur, lowering the water-table, and impeding vegetation growth.",

            "abstract": "Tropical Atlantic climate remains poorly captured in CMIP5 coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models (GCMs). One of the most conspicuous model deficiencies is the reversal of the equatorial zonal sea-surface temperature (SST) gradient relative to observations, with cold biases in the west and warm biases in the east. Previous studies have shown that weaker than observed equatorial easterlies in boreal spring are a major contributor to this reversed SST gradient, and that such wind biases exist even in uncoupled atmospheric GCMs with SSTs prescribed from observations. The wind biases in turn are closely linked to an erroneous southward shift of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) in the models.\nIn the present study we use daily satellite-derived precipitation data as well as CMIP5 model output to investigate the reasons for the erroneous south-equatorial excursions of the simulated Atlantic ITCZ. Observational precipitation data for boreal spring show eastward-traveling disturbances on the equator, whose propagation speed is consistent with that of convectively coupled Kelvin waves. These disturbances originate from the western and central Amazon basin and typically reach the central equatorial Atlantic basin before dissipating. The disturbances help to anchor the observed Atlantic ITCZ over the equator in boreal spring, when the climatological SST are warmest south of the equator.\nAtmospheric GCMs typically produce too little precipitation over the Amazon basin. Furthermore they fail to reproduce the eastward propagating features seen in observations. As a result the boreal spring ITCZ tends to move south of the equator toward the warmest SST. This erroneous southward shift is associated with a weakening of the equatorial trades and constitutes one of the main reasons for the westerly wind bias on the equator. When coupled to an oceanic GCM, the surface wind biases cool SST on and north of the equator in the western tropical Atlantic. This leads to a further southward shift of the ITCZ and amplifies the initial biases.",

            "abstract": "Gravitational instabilities forming at the bottom of spreading volcanic clouds have been observed in many explosive eruptions. They can generate vertical fingers which have been observed to have higher concentrations than the associated plumes. Characterization of volcanic fingers only relies on qualitative observations and quantitative analysis of dedicated experiments.\nFor the first time we present a quantitative description of volcanic fingers developed during the Eyjafjallajökull 2010 eruption (Iceland) as a combination of video imaging and deposit observations. We conclude that the observed fingers on May 4th, 2010 moved downwards at a speed of 1±0.5 m s-1 and were advected laterally by the local wind at a similar speed as the associated cloud (e.g. about 8.5±0.8 m s-1). They continuously formed at the base of the cloud from about 1.4 km from the vent, with an average width and spacing of 168±26 m and 180±60 m, respectively. We could also correlate the sedimentation of fingers with observations of various types of particles aggregates with calculated velocities ranging between 0.1 and 7 m/s. We conclude that the aggregates with the largest terminal velocities sedimented independently of the fingers, while smaller aggregates could form either in the cloud or in the fingers.\nWe have complemented our field data with dedicated experiments in order to investigate the evolution of particle concentration in the mixing region that results from propagation of turbulent convective instabilities. The experimental configuration was similar to that of previous studies with an aqueous suspension of water and spherical glass beads initially overlying a lower density sugar solution. Experiments demonstrate that once fingers are developed, they control sedimentation. In fact, particles are embedded in the fluid and cannot settle individually. This confirms that when settling driven instabilities is the dominating dynamics, particles are likely to settle faster following observed fingers and this enhances the settling of fine particles.\nOur study shows that within an ash cloud, no single explanation for fine particle deposition close to source is supported by the observations, and that a range of distinctive origins is possible.",

            "abstract": "Frequency-dependent characteristics of seismic wave radiation from earthquake sources are important subject for advancing the source physics and the strong-motion prediction. The importance is rediscovered from the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake, for which the sources of the high- (>1 Hz) and low-frequency (<0.1 Hz) seismic waves seem totally different in depths. Our previous study examined the contribution of the notable slip events detected from the source inversion to the low-frequency (0.01-0.125 Hz) waveform synthesis. We found that the very-low-frequency (<0.02 Hz) and the higher-frequency waves seem to be radiated from the shallow and deep portions of the fault, respectively, even in this low-frequency band. However, the examination on the frequency dependence is somewhat indirect. We therefore develop a source inversion method that utilizes the wavelet coefficients as the target to fit. In order to flexibly describe slip velocity functions, we employ the multi-time-window scheme and linear inversion method. Thus, the derived moment rate is directly related to the waveforms in each octave band and we can discuss the frequency content straightforwardly generated by a specific slip event. The method has the other advantage that we can fit the synthetic waveform over the wide frequency bands including that with smaller amplitudes by using frequency-dependent weights in evaluating the fitness. To see the applicability of the developed method, we analyze the largest aftershock (Mw7.9) of the Tohoku-Oki event, whose rupture process seems simpler than the mainshock. The data set consists of 0.01-0.125 Hz strong-motion velocity waveforms, which are divided into four frequency bands. The fitness is evaluated as the residual of the wavelet coefficients normalized by the maximum value for each station and each frequency band. From the wavelet inversion, we estimate one large slip area located deeper than that derived from the waveform inversion. An examination of the waveform synthesis from the shallow and deep portions of the fault shows that the deep portion contributes more greatly to the highest frequency band than the shallow one whereas the two portions equally contribute to the lower-frequency bands. These results may suggest a depth dependence of the frequency contents of the radiated seismic waves.",

            "abstract": "Using high-precision U-Pb dating we are potentially able to determine timescales of porphyry emplacement and ore formation. Previous studies have suggested timescales of porphyry Cu formation ranging from <100 yr, based on modelling diffusive equilibrium between fluids and altered rocks [1], to as much as 1 Ma using U-Pb LA-ICP-MS and SHRIMP dating techniques on zircons [2], [3]. In contrast recent numerical simulations suggest Cu precipitation occurs in the range of 50-100 ka [4]. Therefore in order to better constrain timescales of porphyry Cu formation, we apply high precision U-Pb zircon geochronology, using the youngest zircon date to estimate the emplacement age of each porphyry [5].\nThis study focuses on the ~7 Ma Bajo de la Alumbrera Cu-Au deposit, NW Argentina. The deposit consists of a composite stock of dacitic porphyries. The relative timing of each porphyry intrusion is established based on clear cross-cutting relationships between different porphyry intrusions, which include the pre-mineralisation P2 porphyry, pre-syn-minerlisation EP3 porphyry, and the post-mineralisation LP3 and P4 porphyries.\nSingle zircon crystals from individual porphyry intrusions (P2, EP3, LP3, P4) in the Alumbrera deposit have been dated using CA-ID-TIMS, employing the ET2535 tracer solution for maximum precision and accuracy. All porphyries display protracted zircon crystal growth over 100-200 ka timescales. Using the youngest zircons from each of the porphyry intrusions, Cu mineralisation occurred on 10 ka timescales, similar to those proposed by recent numerical predictions [4]. Trace element and Hf isotopic analyses may reveal geochemical distinctions within the porphyry intrusions and record temporal changes in the magmatic evolution.\n",

            "abstract": "Reservoirs located in highly populated and industrialized regions receive discharges of nutrients and pollutants from the watershed that have great potential to impair water quality and threaten aquatic life. The Euiam reservoir is a multiple-purpose water body used for tourism, fishery, and water supply and has been reported as eutrophic since 1990s. The external nutrients loading is considered to be the main cause of eutrophication of water bodies, and control strategies therefore focus on its reduction. However, algae blooms often continue even after external nutrients loading has been controlled, being benthic nutrient loading the main source of nutrients in the water column.\nAttempts to quantify benthic nutrients fluxes and their role as a source of nutrients to the water column have produced ambiguous results. Benthic flux is dependent on the upward flow of pore water caused by hydrostatic pressure, molecular diffusion, and mixing of sediment and water. In addition, it is controlled by dissolved oxygen (DO) levels, pH values and temperature in the overlying water. Therefore, linking a benthic flux to a water quality model should give us more insight on the effects of benthic fluxes to better quantify nutrient concentration within an entire reservoir system where physical, chemical, biological properties are variable. To represent temporal and spatial variations in the nutrient concentrations of the reservoir, a three-dimensional time variable model, Generalized Longitudinal-Lateral-Vertical Hydrodynamic and Transport (GLLVHT) was selected. The GLLVHT model is imbedded within the Generalized Environmental Modeling System for Surface waters (GEMSS). The computational grid of the three-dimensional model was developed using the GIS. The horizontal grid is composed of 580 active cells at the surface layer with spacing varies from 54.2 m to 69.8 m. There are 15 vertical layers with uniform thickness of 1.9 m resolution. To calibrate the model, model prediction for nutrient concentration was compared with field collected data. The model results showed a good agreement with field measurements. From the model results, the followings are determined and discussed: (1) the role of benthic fluxes on the water quality of the reservoir (2) the extent of benthic fluxes to which the water quality exceeds the criteria.",

            "abstract": "Since September 2011, a continuous water vapour isotopic composition monitoring instrument has been remotely operated in Ivittuut (61.21°N, 48.17°W), southern Greenland. Meteorological parameters are monitored and precipitation has been sampled and analysed for isotopic composition, suggesting equilibrium between surface vapour and precipitation. The data depict small summer diurnal variations. δ18O and deuterium excess (d-excess) are generally anti-correlated and show important seasonal variations (with respective amplitudes of 10 and 20 ‰), and large synoptic variations associated to low-pressure systems (typically +5‰ on δ18O and −15‰ on d-excess).\nThe moisture sources, estimated based on Lagrangian back-trajectories, are primarily influenced by the western North Atlantic, and north-eastern American continent. Notable are important seasonal and synoptic shifts of the moisture sources, and sporadic influences of the Arctic or the eastern North Atlantic. Moisture sources variations can be related to changes in water vapour isotopic composition, and the isotopic fingerprints can be attributed to the areas of moisture origins. Isotopic enabled AGCMs nudged to meteorology (LMDZiso, ECHAM5-wiso), despite biases, correctly capture the δ18O changes, but underestimate the d-excess changes. They allow to identify a high correlation between the southern Greenland d-excess and the simulated relative humidity and d-excess in the moisture source region south of Greenland.\nAn extreme high temperature event in July 2012 affecting all Greenland, similar to ice sheet melt events during the medieval periods and one event in 1889 documented by Greenland ice core records, has been analysed regarding water vapour isotopic composition, using remote sensing (IASI) and in situ observations from Bermuda to northern Greenland (NEEM station). Our southern Greenland observations allow to track the water vapour evolution during this event along the moisture transport path, depicting the northward propagation of an isotopic signal inherited from the meteorological conditions during evaporation.\nOverall, our observations provide valuable information for interpreting Greenland ice core records as well as for evaluating water vapour isotopic simulations in atmospheric models.",

            "abstract": "The island of Vulcano belongs to the Aeolian Islands archipelago in Italy. The main active volcano in Vulcano is La Fossa cone. The island is exposed to many natural hazards, including landslides. Several phenomena such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, fumarolic activity and intense rainfall can generate landslides. The northern and eastern parts of la Fossa cone are the most prone to landslide hazard.\nIn 1988, a rockslide occurred on the northeast flank of La Fossa cone, which generated a small tsunami and was probably triggered by the increase of fumarolic and seismic activity. The volume of rocks involved in this event has been estimated around 200000 m3 by pre- and post- event modeling studies. Present investigations on the field lead to an estimation of the volume of the 1988 landslide closer to 100’000 m3 and they have allowed identifying a residual unstable rock volume, comprised in the existing scar, of around 39000 m3 that could be mobilized as rockslide. No current fumarolic activity was observed near the unstable volume.\nThe northern flank of the La Fossa cone is located above a populated area, the village of Porto. The survey of this area has allowed the identification of four unstable zones. We have specially focused on the cliff overhanging the Forgie craters because of the potential risk for the village below. Strong fumarolic alterations and open fractures characterize the studied area. The instable volume identified in this area could be mobilized by toppling or sliding. Three blocks of about 75 m3 have been located on this flank, which are partly detached from the adjacent side and could be involved in toppling. A larger area could be also involved in rockfalls and rockslides. Three different scenarios have been considered with different volumes. The worst-case scenario estimates a volume of around 8000 m3 and a series of numerical simulation has been carried out with the 2D discrete element code WinMimes developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The resulting outcomes have allowed us to also compile a propagation map.",

            "abstract": "Sun-aligned auroral arcs (SAAs) are one of the outstanding phenomena in the high-latitude region during periods of northward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). Smaller scale SAAs tend to occur either in the duskside or dawnside of the polar cap and are known to drift in the dawn-dusk direction depending on the sign of the IMF By. Studies of SAAs are of particular importance because they represent dynamical characteristics of their source plasma in the magnetosphere, for example in the interaction region between the solar wind and magnetosphere or in the boundary between the plasma sheet and tail lobe. To date, however, very little has been known about the spatial structure and/or temporal evolution of the magnetospheric counterpart of SAAs. In order to gain more comprehensive understanding of the field-aligned plasma transport in the vicinity of SAAs, we have investigated an event of SAAs on November 10, 2005, during which multiple SAAs were detected by a ground-based all-sky camera at Resolute Bay, Canada. During this interval, several SAAs were detached from the duskside oval and moved poleward. The large-scale structure of these arcs was visualized by space-based imagers of TIMED/GUVI and DMSP/SSUSI. In addition to these optical observations, we employ the Cluster satellites to reveal the high-altitude particle signature corresponding to the small-scale SAAs. The ionospheric footprints of the 4 Cluster satellites encountered the SAAs sequentially and observed well correlated enhancements of electron fluxes at weak energies (< 1 keV). The Cluster satellites also detected signatures of upflowing beams of ions and electrons in the vicinity of the SAAs. This implies that these ions and electrons were accelerated upward by a quasi-stationary electric field existing in the vicinity of the SAAs and constitute a current system in the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling system. Ionospheric convection measurement from one of the SuperDARN radars shows an indication that the SAAs are embedded in the lobe cell during northward IMF conditions. In the presentation, we will show the results of detailed comparison between the ground-based radio and optical signatures of the SAAs and those obtained by the Cluster spacecraft at magnetospheric altitudes.",

            "abstract": "The importance of surface wave mode coupling when modelling body-wave phases by surface-wave mode summation is now well understood but many surface-wave tomography techniques continue to rely on the assumption of modes propagating independently from source to receiver. We present an investigation into the pitfalls of this assumption at periods shorter than about 50s. Synthetic tests are conducted using a finite difference solution of the elastic wave equation in 2D Earth models that consist of a region of lateral heterogeneity imposed on a laterally homogeneous background medium. Green's functions in the background medium are computed numerically and the finite difference algorithm is used only to compute the scattered wavefield produced by the heterogeneity, so this approach allows us to see how a single mode incident on the heterogenous region emerges from it as a multimode wavetrain. A combination of dispersion analysis and eigenfunction decomposition of the emergent wavefield is used to study the exact redistribution of energy among the surface-wave modes. This is then checked against theoretical multiple scattering methods which exploit the concept of invariant embedding and are able to exactly describe surface-wave mode coupling. The synthetic seismograms generated in our tests as described above are inverted using a multimode inversion technique which decomposes a waveform into a set of independent modes. We find strong artefacts in the path average models obtained by such an inversion. It is demonstrated that whilst the inversion is successful in cases where the measured modes are generated at the source, it fails in cases where any of the measured modes are generated by mode conversions along the horizontal path from source to receiver. Since inversion for path average medium properties is often the first part of two-step tomographic procedures, our results have strong implications for surface-wave tomography.",

            "abstract": "Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a significant precursor of sulfuric acid and sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere. Field and model studies have revealed that heterogeneous reaction on mineral dusts seem to be an important sink for SO2. However, available kinetic data about heterogeneous reaction of SO2 on authentic mineral dusts are scarce and are mainly limited at low humidity relative (RH). In addition, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is the predominant oxidant of SO2 in the aqueous phase, may be able to promote the heterogeneous oxidation of SO2 on mineral dusts, but little is known about this role that H2O2 may play. In this study, we investigated the uptake kinetics of SO2 on authentic mineral dusts in the absence and presence of H2O2 at different RHs using a filter-based reactor. Three different authentic mineral dusts, i.e., Asian dust storm particles (ADS), Arizona test dust (ATD) and Tengger Desert sand (TDS), were used. The initial gas phase concentration of SO2 and H2O2 is about 5 ppbv and 0.8 ppbv, respectively, the typical concentration in the atmosphere. The values of uptake coefficients, γBET, on these particles are on the order of 10-5 under dry condition. Interestingly, with increasing RH, the γBET decreases on ADS particles, but increases on ATD and TDS particles. The difference in the mineralogy composition of these dust samples seems to rationalize the discrepancy in SO2 uptake. Furthermore, it is found that the presence of H2O2 increases the γBET by 45-90% on ADS, 45-150% on ATD and 40%-105% on TDS as RH increases 0 to 90%. One possible explanation for the observed behavior are that H2O2 can immediately react with SO2 on the surface of mineral dusts. Our results suggest that the role of heterogeneous reaction on mineral dusts as a sink of SO2 or a source of sulfate in the atmosphere may be underestimated due to the excluding of the enhancement effect of H2O2 in current atmospheric models.",

Short-lived compounds which are usually only present close to their sources on the ground are rapidly injected into the upper troposphere where they alter the chemical equilibria typical of that region of the Earth’s atmosphere. One important consequence is, for example, the formation of ozone which acts as a greenhouse gas in the UT.\nNASA’s SEAC4RS mission took advantage of the heavily instrumented DC-8 aircraft to study convective events in the South Eastern and South Central US. Here we will show a detailed experimental and modeling analysis of a convective event sampled on September 11, 2013 over Arkansas. Insoluble species such as isoprene were strongly elevated in the UT while soluble species had been removed by strong precipitation. Ozone was formed in the presence of lightning NOx.

In this study, 17 record-breaking event processes (RBEPs) of low temperature during 1981-2012 are identified by using daily minimum temperature at 1897 meteorological stations in China. The RBEPs of low temperature are mostly located in southern China in 1990s but concentrated in northern China in 2000s, which is largely attributed to different AO pattern between the two decades. Furthermore, four typical RBEPs of low temperature are selected to examine the related synoptic-scale atmospheric circulation changes and eddy kinetic energy transports. In the two RBEPs of low temperature occurring in southern China in 1990s, the continent high pressure over Mongolia area was extremely intensified and the East Asian polar front jet stream was enhanced accompanied with strong synoptic-scale eddy kinetic energy transports. Correspondingly, the cold air masses broke out and unobstructed intruded southward to low latitudes, causing severe cooling effect in southern China. In the other two cases occurring at northern China in 2000s, however, the extremely intensified high pressure located over northern Siberian area, combining with northward enhanced subtropical jet stream, then cold air masses were accumulated and blocked at mid-latitudes, resulting in RBEPs of low temperature in this area.",

Together these datasets provide extensive global and temporal coverage and measure both extensive (AOT) as well as intensive aerosol properties (AE & SSA).\nModels and observations differ strongly in their spatio-temporal sampling. Model results are typical of large gridboxes (100 by 100 km), while observations are made over much smaller areas (10 by 10 km for MODIS, even smaller for AERONET and MAN). Model results are always available in contrast to observations that are intermittent due to orbital constraints, retrieval limitations and instrument failure/maintenance. We find that differences in AOT due to sampling effects can be 100% for instantaneous values and can still be 40% for monthly or yearly averages. Such differences are comparable to or larger than typical retrieval errors in the observations. We propose strategies (temporal colocation, spatial aggregation) for reducing these sampling errors\nFinally, we evaluate one year of co-located AOT, AE and SSA from several AEROCOM models against MODIS, AERONET and MAN observations. Where the observational datasets overlap, they give similar results but in general they allow us to evaluate models in very different spatio-temporal domains. We show that even small datasets like MAN AOT or AERONET SSA, provide a useful standard for evaluating models thanks to temporal colocation. The models differ quite a bit from the observations and each model differs in its own way. These results are presented through global maps of yearly averaged differences, time-series of modelled and observed data, scatter plots of correlations among observables (e.g. SSA vs AE) and Taylor diagrams. In particular, we find that the AEROCOM emissions substantially underestimate wildfire emissions and that many models have aerosol that is too absorbing.",

The study site is located on the Teine Landslide (width: 2 km, Length: 6.5 km) in the western suburb of Sapporo city in Hokkaido Island, Japan, which collapsed more than 50,000 years ago. Since then streams have been developing and incising the landslide mass consisted of rock debris and volcanic deposits, presently causing a series of small deep-seated landslides along the banks. Because Sapporo is the economic center of Hokkaido and the suburb is expanding at the toe of the Teine slide, it is important to understand the behaviors of these active slopes to protect residents and infrastructures from unexpected disasters possibly triggered by an intense storm or earthquake. The LiDAR data for the area was first obtained by a manned helicopter in August 2010, and another survey by an unmanned helicopter is planned in autumn 2014 to estimate their activities from changes in the ground surfaces during the period from 2010 to 2014. Ground water level and landslide mass movements have also been monitored on site by using the coring holes for sampling since 2013. The combination of the data sets can make up the deficits of these methods, e.g., errors created through data processing for LiDAR survey and spatially limited information for ground monitoring, enabling to provide a solid three dimensional view of the slope movements. The notion obtained can be utilized to predict their future behaviors as well as to discover active but hiding landslides nearby. This study also showed that repeat monitoring of sites is a way of utilizing UAVs, particularly in terms of cost and convenience.",

            "abstract": "CRUCIAL is an ESA/STSE funded project investigating innovative land and inland water applications from Cryosat-2 with a forward-look component to the future Sentinel-3 mission. The fact that the Earth’s land surface is, in general, a relatively poor reflector of Ku band energy, with the exceptions of inland water, salar and ice surfaces has enabled Earth-orbiting satellite radar altimeters to be used for land surface applications including mapping and measurement of river and lake systems. The high along-track sampling of Cryosat-2 altimeter in SAR mode (I8 KHz) offers the opportunity to recover high frequency signals over much of the Earth’s land surface, enhancing the inland water height retrieval capability. Constraining this application is the limited availability of SAR Full Bit Rate (FBR) data from Cryosat-2 over these land surfaces; however, for Sentinel-3 the SAR mode will be deployed widely over land. This paper will summarise the CRUCIAL aims and objectives and present preliminary inland water heights from retracked Cryosat-2 altimetric waveforms, including results over Lake Malawi, the Amazon, Mekong and Brahmaputra with validation against in situ and other satellite data where possible.",

            "abstract": "Energy production from renewable sources such as wind or solar power is subject to natural temporal fluctuations. Therefore, energy storage will become indispensable when renewable sources represent a substantial share in the total energy production. Subsurface storage of synthetically produced hydrogen in porous sandstone formations is particularly suited for large amounts of energy and relatively long production cycles. The increasing use of the subsurface, however, demands for an a priori analysis of possible effects of a storage operation in order to minimize environmental risks and interference with other usages, such as geothermal energy storage or groundwater abstraction. In this context, this work aims at an assessment of thermal and hydraulic impacts of a hypothetical hydrogen storage scenario in an anticlinal structure in northern Germany using numerical process simulations. The storage structure consists of partially eroded Rhaetian sandstones acting as the storage formation with the upper barrier formations being mud- and chalkstones of the Lower Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous. The storage operation was modeled over a period of one year using three wells located on the flank of the structure near its top. Each production cycle was set to a duration of seven days in which an equivalent of around 280000 GJ were extracted. The numerical simulations were carried out using the Eclipse E300 simulator (Schlumberger) in conjunction with the open source THMC-simulator OpenGeoSys, where the hydraulic- and mass transport processes are solved by Eclipse and the heat transport processes by OpenGeoSys. The simulation results show that the thermal effects due to the storage operation are mainly limited to the immediate vicinity of the storage wells, thus their reach is on the decimeter to meter scale. Since heat transport is dominated by thermal conduction this also includes the sealing formations above and below the storage formation. Moreover, the propagation of thermal effects is damped by the cyclic nature of the storage operation. The effects resulting from induced hydraulic processes show a considerably larger reach of less than 10 km in lateral directions within the actual storage formation. The vertical propagation is strongly dependent on the integrity of the sealing formation atop the storage formation.",

            "abstract": "Theories of optimality and self-organization are appealing when dealing with non-linear systems, because based on first principles of thermodynamic these theories may lead to an intuitive interpretation and prediction of absolute values, directions, and interactions of gradients and fluxes, and universal inference laws for effective conductances. In this context, for example, the maximum entropy production principle received attention, because of its foundation in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, which appears to be useful in e.g., eco-hydrologic and atmospheric applications. A number of studies successfully applied this principle in the optimization of conductances in simplified and well-mixed open systems with external (periodic) forcing. In support-scale simulations of a variably saturated hillslope, the study presented here relaxes major simplifying assumptions by applying a realistic, arid atmospheric time series in spinup simulations to create a dynamic equilibrium utilizing the integrated hydrologic model ParFlow-CLM. The simulated hillslope exhibits time-varying internal circulation patterns due to the periodic atmospheric forcing, topography, and also heterogeneity by utilizing and optimizing all degrees of freedom provided by the soil-water retention relationship and free-moving water table. Because of the extreme non-linearity of variably saturated flow under arid climate conditions, the system is never well mixed and optimality principles relying on time-integrated gradients and fluxes do not appear to be applicable in the currently available theoretical framework. Here, integrated support-scale simulations may be useful in deriving novel theories for the application to real systems in future.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic ash particle size distributions are critical in determining the fate of airborne ash in drifting clouds. A significant amount of global airspace is managed using dispersion models that rely on a single ash particle size distribution, derived from a single source - Hobbs et al., 1991. This is clearly wholly inadequate given the range of magmatic compositions and eruptive styles that volcanoes present. Available measurements of airborne ash lognormal particle size distributions show geometric standard deviation values that range from 1.0 – 2.5, with others showing mainly polymodal distributions. This paucity of data pertaining to airborne sampling of volcanic ash results in large uncertainties both when using an assumed distribution to retrieve mass loadings from satellite observations and when prescribing particle size distributions of ash in dispersion models. Uncertainty in the particle size distribution can yield order of magnitude differences to mass loading retrievals of an ash cloud from satellite observations, a result that can easily reclassify zones of airspace closure. The uncertainty arises from the assumptions made when defining both the geometric particle size and particle single scattering properties in terms of an effective radius. This has significant implications for airspace management and emphasises the need for an improved quantification of airborne volcanic ash particle size distributions.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to clarify transportation and consumption processes of atmospheric nitrate deposited into forested ecosystems, and the influences on downstream aquatic ecosystem. We collected rainfall, throughfall, surface water, soilwater (10cm, 30cm), groundwater, spring water and streamwater at a forested watershed planted with Japanese cypress in Shiga prefecture, central Japan at about biweekly. Samples were analyzed for dissolved nitrogen, nitrate, ammonium, nitrite, and oxygen isotope of nitrate. Isotope analysis was conducted at ICRE in University of Yamanashi. We also collected soil at several month intervals, and measured nitrate, ammonium in soil and net mineralization and nitrification rate.\nPrecipitation in winter (from December 2012 to April 2013) was 602mm. Atmospheric nitrate deposition by throughfall during this period was 4.13 kgN/ha. Atmospheric nitrate flux by surface flow and soil water leaching from 10cm and 30cm were 0.005, 0.58 and 0.99 kgN/ha, respectively. Nitrified nitrate flux in this period by surface flow and soil water leaching from 10cm and 30cm were 0.0005, 0.27 and 0.32 kgN/ha, respectively.\nOn the other hand, precipitation in summer (from May 2013 to October) was 1199mm. Atmospheric nitrate deposition by throughfall during the period was 4.10 kg/ha. Atmospheric nitrate flux in surface flow and soil water leaching from 10cm and 30cm were 0.038, 0.51 and 0.99 kgN/ha, respectively at this period. Nitrified nitrate flux by surface flow and soil water leaching from 10cm and 30cm 0.020, 1.31, 1.57 kgN/ha, respectively at this period.\nThese results suggested that the amount of atmospheric nitrate leaching in soil water was influenced by not the amount of precipitation but atmospheric nitrate deposition by throughfall. On the other hand, nitrified nitrate leaching by soil water had seasonality that it was larger in summer than winter.",

            "abstract": "The existing regional frequency analysis has disadvantages in that it is difficult to consider geographical characteristics in estimating areal rainfall. In this regard, This study aims to develop a hierarchical Bayesian model based regional frequency analysis in that spatial patterns of the design rainfall with geographical information are explicitly incorporated. This study assumes that the parameters of Gumbel distribution are a function of geographical characteristics (e.g. altitude, latitude and longitude) within a general linear regression framework. Posterior distributions of the regression parameters are estimated by Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Calro (MCMC) method, and the identified functional relationship is used to spatially interpolate the parameters of the Gumbel distribution by using digital elevation models (DEM) as inputs. The proposed model is applied to derive design rainfalls over the entire Han-river watershed. It was found that the proposed Bayesian regional frequency analysis model showed similar results compared to L-moment based regional frequency analysis. In addition, the model showed an advantage in terms of quantifying uncertainty of the design rainfall and estimating the area rainfall considering geographical information.\nAcknowledgement: This research was supported by a grant (14AWMP-B079364-01) from Water Management Research Program funded by Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of Korean government.",

            "abstract": "The burning of forests in the Amazonia region is a globally significant source of carbonaceous aerosol, containing both absorbing and scattering components. Biomass burning aerosol (BBA) are efficient CCN, modifying cloud properties and influencing atmospheric circulation and precipitation tendencies. The impacts of BBA are highly dependent on their size distribution and composition. Studies in this region can therefore benefit greatly from the use of state-of-the-art sectional aerosol representations.\nA bottom-up fire emissions inventory, 3BEM, has been developed by Longo et al.1. It uses satellite products to identify fire locations, applying the emissions factors of Andrei and Merlot3 to generate daily emission maps. Flaming emissions are very buoyant, and a method for injecting emissions at altitude is needed to accurately describe the vertical profile of BBA. A parameterisation has been developed to simulate this sub-grid process4, and previously implemented in WRF-Chem using a modal aerosol scheme5. For this work we have modified the WRF-Chem model to simulate 3BEM emissions using the MOSAIC sectional aerosol scheme6.\nThis modified version of WRF-Chem v3.4.1 has been run for September 2012 over South America (25km grid-spacing). We will present model results evaluating the modelled aerosol vertical distribution, size distribution, composition and optical properties against measurements taken by the FAAM BAe-146 research aircraft during the SAMBBA field campaign. The plume-rise parameterisation was found to inject flaming emissions too high over most fires, resulting in high modelled aerosol loadings at high altitude. We probed the behaviour of the parameterisation by developing a new SAMBBA-tuned 3BEM emissions scenario, which uses more realistic estimates of fire size. Results from high-resolution (5 and 1km) nested simulations will also be presented, in order to evaluate the impacts of explicit aerosol-cloud interactions in non-parameterised clouds. \n1. K.

            "abstract": "Teak (Tectona grandis Linn. f.) plantations cover vast areas throughout Southeast Asia and are of great economic importance. This study has sought to increase our understanding of throughfall inputs under teak by analyzing the abiotic and biotic factors governing throughfall amounts and throughfall ratios in relation to three canopy phenophases (leafless, leafing, and leafed). There is no rain during the brief leaf senescence phenophase. Daily data was available for both throughfall volumes and depths as well as leaf area index. Detailed meteorological data were available in situ every ten minutes. Leveraging this high-resolution field data, we employed boosted regression trees (BRT) analysis to identify the primary controls on throughfall amount and ratio during each of the three canopy phenophases. Whereas throughfall amounts were always dominated by the magnitude of rainfall (as expected), throughfall ratios were governed by a suite of predictor variables during each phenophase. The BRT analysis demonstrated that throughfall ratio in the leafless phase was most influenced (in descending order of importance) by air temperature, rainfall amount, maximum wind speed, and rainfall intensity. Throughfall ratio in the leafed phenophase was dominated by rainfall amount which exerted 54.0% of the relative influence. The leafing phenophase was an intermediate case where rainfall amount, air temperature, and vapor pressure deficit were most important. Our results highlight the fact that throughfall ratios are differentially influenced by a suite of meteorological variables during leafless, leafing, and leafed phenophases. Abiotic variables (rainfall amount, air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, and maximum wind speed) trumped leaf area index and stand density in their effect on throughfall ratio. The leafing phenophase, while transitional in nature and short in duration, has a detectable and unique impact on water inputs to teak plantations. Further work is clearly needed to better gauge the importance of the leaf emergence period to the stemflow hydrology and forest biogeochemistry of teak plantations.",

            "abstract": "By alternating full waveform inversion and traveltime tomography we attempt to merge their complementary merits and produce models of the European continent that explain both waveform and traveltime data sets.\nTechnological developments and advances in theoretical and numerical seismology allow us to assimilate complete waveforms for the solution of full waveform tomographic problems. On regional to continental scales, however, full waveform inversion is still and will also in the long term be limited to an intermediate period band because of computational limitations. Valuable information contained in high-frequency P and S wave traveltimes cannot be exploited. Since mainly surface waves can be observed in the period range that is technically feasible, full waveform inversion yields excellent results in the upper 300 km, where surface wave sensitivity is large. At greater depth S velocity anomalies are less well resolved and generally P velocity heterogeneities are not well constrained at all.\nIn contrast, classical traveltime tomography intrinsically incorporates information from high-frequency body waves. However, traveltime methods are deficient for longer periods due to the commonly used infinite frequency approximation of the wave equation.\nTo combine their complementary assets and extend the spectrum of exploited information, we develop an inversion scheme, where full waveform inversion and ray tomography alternate, thereby avoiding an explicit coupling of both methods and data sets. We put special emphasis on its ability to produce 3D models that explain both waveform and traveltime data sets. We start with a full waveform inversion model and machinery of Europe and Western Asia in conjunction with the traveltime tomography package FMTOMO. For the traveltime update we use the teleseismic data set that constrains the global model S40RTS, complemented with measurements distributed by the International Seismological Centre. Avoiding difficulties in modeling the complexities in the crust and upper mantle, the traveltime update primarily introduces information in deeper parts of the model. After alternating both methods the resulting model finally incorporates information from traveltime measurements and from waveform data, thus proving the compatibility of both approaches.",

            "abstract": "The broadband Grafenberg array (Germany) has been installed in 1976 and, thanks to visionary scientists and network maintainers, the continuous data acquired has been preserved until today. Using state of the art pre-processing and cross-correlation techniques, we are able to extract cross-correlation functions (CCF) between sensor pairs.\nIt has been shown recently that, provided enough computation power is available, there is no need to define a reference CCF to compare all days to. Indeed, one can compare each day to all days, computing the \"all-doublet\". The number of calculations becomes huge (N vs ref = N calculations, N vs N= N*N), but the result, once inverted, is way more stable because of the N observations per day. This analysis has been done on a parallelized version of MSNoise (http://msnoise.org), running on the VEGA cluster hosted at the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB, Belgium).\nHere, we present preliminary results of the analysis of two stations, GRA1 and GRA2, the first two stations installed in March 1976. The interferogram (observation of the CCF through time, see Figure) already shows interesting features in the ballistic wave shape, highly correlated to the seasons. A reasonably high correlation can still be seen outside the ballistic arrival, after +-5 second lag time. The lag times between 5 and 25 seconds are then used to compute the dv/v using the all-doublet method. We expect to evidence daily to seasonal, or even to longer period dv/v variations and/or noise source position changes using this method. Once done with 1 sensor pair, the full data of the Grafenberg array will be used to enhance the resolution even more.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake location in 1D Earth models is a routine procedure. Particularly in environments such as subduction zones where the network geometry is biased and lateral velocity variations are large, the use of a 1D model can lead to strongly biased solutions. This is well-known and it is therefore usually preferred to use three-dimensional models, e.g. from local earthquake tomography. Efficient codes for earthquake location in 3D models are available for routine use, for example NonLinLoc. However, tomographic studies are time-consuming to carry out, and a sufficient number of data might not always be available. However, in many cases, information about the three-dimensional velocity structure is available in the form of refraction surveys or other constraints such as gravity or receiver functions based models. Failing that, global or regional scale crustal models could be employed. However, it is not obvious that models derived using different types of data lead to better location results than an optimised 1D velocity model. On the other hand, correct interpretation of seismicity patterns often requires comparison and exaxt positioning in pre-existing velocity models. In this presentation we draw on examples from the Chilean and Sumatran margins as well as a mid-ocean ridge environments, using both data and synthetic examples to investigate under what conditions the use of a priori 3D models is expected to result in improved location results and modifies interpretation. Furthermore, we introduce MATLAB tools that facilitate the creation of three-dimensional models suitable for earthquake location from refraction profiles, CRUST1 and SLAB1.0 and other model types.",

            "abstract": "The Tibetan Plateau is a key locality in understanding large-scale continental dynamics. A large number of investigations have examined the structure and processes in eastern Tibet, however western Tibet remains relatively understudied. The limited number of previous studies in this region indicate that the western part of the Tibetan Plateau is not a simple extension of the eastern part, despite the lack of surface features indicating differences between these two regions. In particular, wavespeeds higher than those in eastern Tibet have been observed in the upper mantle by a number of investigators. We present new, high resolution, shear velocity models for Northwest India and West Tibet from the joint inversion of P receiver functions and fundamental mode Rayleigh wave group velocities recorded at seismic stations in four arrays in this region. The areas covered by these arrays include the Karakoram and Altan-Taygh faults, major terrane boundaries in West Tibet and the Himalayas. The arrays used include broadband data collected by the West Tibet Array, a US-China deployment on the western side of the Tibetan Plateau between 2007-2011, and a French experiment in 2001. We construct group velocity tomographic maps throughout Central and Southern Asia from surface wave data between periods of 5-70s. The inclusion of Rayleigh wave dispersion measurements from ambient noise cross-correlations between stations in the West Tibet Array allow a local node spacing as fine as 0.25 degrees, meaning it is possible to resolve features as small as 1 degree at short periods in that region. These group velocity maps appears to confirm observations that group velocities at 60 and 70s group velocities are higher in West Tibet than they are in East Tibet. We use the shear wave velocity models obtained from the joint inversion to obtain estimates of Moho depth in Northwest India and West Tibet. The Moho is deep throughout Tibet in this region, increasing northwards and flattening out somewhat beneath the Lhasa and Qiangtang Terranes to a depth of 68-76km. We do not observe Moho depths as deep as those suggested by Wittlinger et al. 2004. The shear velocity models include a low velocity layer in the mid-crust beneath Tibet and into the Tethyan Himalayas. This feature has been seen in some, but not all, previous work in this region.",

            "abstract": "Here we investigate seismic anisotropy of the upper crust in the vicinity of Soufrière Hills volcano using shear wave splitting (SWS) analysis from volcano-tectonic (VT) events. Soufrière Hills, which is located on the Island of Montserrat in the Lesser Antilles, became active in 1995 and has been erupting ever since with 5 major phases of extrusive activity. We use data recored on a network of seismometers between 1996 and 2007 partially spanning three eruptive phases. Shear-wave splitting in the crust is often assumed to be controlled by either by structural features, or by stress aligned cracks. In such a case the polarisation of the fast shear wave (phi) would align parallel to the strike of the structure, or to the maximum compressive stress direction. Previous studies analysing SWS in the region using regional earthquakes observed temporal variations in phi which were interpreted as being caused by stress perturbations associated with pressurisation of a dyke. Our analysis, which uses much shallower sources and thus only samples the anisotropy of the upper few kilometres of the crust, shows no clear temporal variation. However, temporal effects cannot be ruled out, as large fluctuations in the rate of VT events over the course of the study period as well as changes in the seismic network configuration make it difficult to assess. Average delay times of approximately 0.2 seconds, similar in magnitude to that reported for much deeper slab events, suggest that the bulk of the anisotropy is in the shallow crust. We observe clear spatial variations in anisotropy which we believe are consistent with structurally controlled anisotropy resulting from a left-lateral transtensional array of faults which crosses the volcanic complex.",

            "abstract": "Stimulation of enhanced geothermal system (EGS) reservoirs by fluid injection enhances reservoir permeability by inducing microearthquakes (MEQs). Observations during the 2012 stimulation of the reservoir showed a bimodal depth distribution of seismicity. During seven weeks of hydraulic stimulation of well NWG 55-29, ~90% of the MEQs occurred in the shallow reservoir (~500 m to ~1800 m), ~10% occurred adjacent to the bottom half of the open borehole (~2500 to ~3000 m), while no seismicity was observed in the intervening interval (~2000 m to ~2500 m). Analyses of frictional stability using spatial models for fluid pressure diffusion of injected fluids shows that the distribution of MEQs is consistent with an observed distressing-of and leak-through the casing. However, this is incapable of explaining the anomalous absence of seismicity at intermediate depths. Hence, we performed rate-state friction (RSF) experiments on five samples of drill cuttings that represent the discrete depths of the MEQs zones. The results, with the effects of applied normal stresses, mineral contents and calcite dissolution on frictional parameter a-b of each sample, indicate that the observation of MEQ depths is indeed consistent with experimentally determined distributions of frictional strength and stability posited to transition from stability at intermediate depth to instability both below and above.",

            "abstract": "The Okinawa trough, a back-arc basin formed behind the Ryukyu arc-trench system, southwest Japan, represents an active rifting zone associated with extension of the continental lithosphere. The basin is located at the southeastern margin of the Eurasian plate and characterized by axial rift valleys with over 1.0 km depth and ~100 km width. Previous studies suggest that the early rifting phase started late Miocene and crustal extension is currently active at a full rate of 30 to 50 mm/yr. Within the basin, numerous active hydrothermal vents are observed, suggesting that the crustal rifting enhances melt/heat transfer from the deep mantle up to the seafloor. However, internal structure beneath the back-arc basin and its relation to the rifting system are little documented. Complex regional tectonic setting, such as active collision in Taiwan to the west, oblique subduction of the Philippine Sea slab, and changing spreading rate along the rift axis, may also have significant influences on the thermal structure and flow within the mantle wedge, but their relative roles in controlling the rifting mode and magmatic supply are still poorly understood. As a step toward filling this gap in knowledge, we started a new 7-year project that consists of four two-dimensional active-source seismic experiments and extensive passive-source seismic observations along the Ryukyu arc. In 2013, active-source seismic data were collected on the first line that crosses the southernmost part of the Ryukyu arc-trench and Okinawa trough at 124-125°E. For refraction/wide-angle reflection analyses, a total of 60 ocean bottom seismographs were deployed with approximately 6 km spacing on a ~390-km-long profile. On the same line, multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection profiling was also carried out. Seismic velocity models obtained by first arrival tomography show that beneath the volcanic arc a thick layer (~10 km) of the middle crust with Vp = 6.0-6.8 km/s is developed, a typical feature in the major volcanic arc in the circum-Pacific region, but such thick layers are not observed beneath the Okinawa trough. Correspondingly, crustal thickness significantly varies: Crust thins from over 20 km beneath the volcanic arc to ~15 km beneath the back-arc basin.",

            "abstract": "We describe a Micromagnetics, Inc. magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) scanning microscope developed for the University of Cambridge Nanopaleomagnetism Lab. The MTJ sensor used contains a thin film multilayer structure, whose core consists of two ferromagnetic electrodes, separated by an insulating layer. One of the electrodes is magnetically pinned via exchange bias to an antiferromagnetic layer, while the other is free to react to an external magnetic field. The magnetization of the pinned layer is fixed in a perpendicular direction, so this ferromagnetic junction can be used as a low-field magnetic sensor. The magnetoresistance of the junction is dependent on the magnetic orientation of the electrodes, and is quantified as the percent change between the low and high resistance states. The higher its value, the more sensitive the device is, which makes the MTJ sensor (magnetoresistance exceeding 200%) particularly attractive for detecting small-scale magnetic structures. The MTJ sensor does not require the use of cryogens, enabling straightforward, low-cost operation of the microscope. The lack of cryogen technology means the sensor can be brought close to the sample surface, routinely allowing for sample-to-sensor distances of 15-20 μm. Scan height depends on factors such as scanning mode (if using a static or vibrating stage), sample surface configuration, or sensor configuration (i.e., proximity of the sensor to the tip of the die). This renders the MTJ microscope capable of producing magnetic images that may resolve features as small as 15 μm, and of detecting field intensities lower than 1 μT. This technology is particularly useful for detecting stray fields from micro-regions of interest preserving the original paleomagnetic signature within a bulk sample that may also contain remagnetised regions. Examples include ancient or altered rocks, extraterrestrial materials, samples containing inclusions or exsolution structures, and in general specimens characterised by spatial heterogeneity. In addition, the high-resolution capability of the MTJ microscope makes it extremely useful for investigating sedimentary archives formed under low accumulation conditions (e.g., speleothems, stromatolites, Fe-Mn nodules) that hold a detectable environmental magnetic signal.",

The tomography inversion uses the envelope shape of the S wave seismograms from over 300 strong events (M > 3.5). The resulting attenuation structures appear to be consistent with the distribution of seismic velocities. The obtained 3-D attenuation model distinguishes the low-attenuation zones down to 5 km depth corresponding to the rigid basaltic cover. At greater depths, we detect a high-attenuation anomaly coinciding with the main seismicity cluster. We propose that this zone corresponds to the upper part of the conduit area ascending from deeper magma sources.

            "abstract": "As an episode of rapid global warming associated with the release of massive quantities of carbon to the atmosphere and oceans, the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, 56 Ma) is considered a potential analog for modern anthropogenic carbon emissions. Although there is still some debate regarding the exact mass and isotopic composition of the carbon source responsible for this event, numerical models have been used to interpret existing records as being consistent with a total release of between 3000 and 6000 Pg C. Despite this estimate being comparable to potential future fossil fuel CO2 release, the rate of carbon release during the PETM is still a major area of uncertainty and precludes any straightforward comparisons between the paleo-record and the modern. Here we use the Earth system model cGENIE to quantify the consequences of differing carbon emissions rates on the isotopic record of different carbon reservoirs. We test a range of emissions scenarios – from years to millenia and constant versus pulsed emissions rates – and trace the resulting carbon isotope records within the atmosphere, with depth in the ocean, and in the sedimentary record. We identify the characteristic relationship between the difference in carbon isotope excursion sizes between atmospheric CO2 and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and the duration of emissions. From available isotope records spanning the PETM we hence constrain the duration of carbon emissions to less than 2500 years. Our experiments also provide a general interpretive framework for assessing rates of carbon emissions for other events.",

On the island Sjælland, which includes urban and agricultural regions, a doubling of groundwater abstraction rates has been proposed in selected areas to meet water resource demands. This study evaluates the risk to stream ecological conditions for a lowland Danish catchment under multiple scenarios of climate change and groundwater abstraction. Projections of future climate (i.e. precipitation, temperature, reference evapotranspiration) come from the ENSEMBLES climate modelling project. Climate variables from 11 climate models are first bias corrected with a distribution based scaling (DBS) method (Seaby et al., 2013) and then used to force hydrological simulations of stream discharge, groundwater recharge, and nitrate leaching from the root zone under present (1991-2010) and future (2071-2100) climate conditions. Hydrological modelling utilises a sequential coupling methodology with DAISY, a one dimensional crop model describing soil water dynamics in the root zone, and MIKE SHE, a distributed groundwater-surface water model which the National Water Resources Model (DK-model) is set up in (Henriksen et al., 2003). We find low flow and annual discharge to be most impacted by scenarios of climate change, with high variation across climate models (+/- 40% change). Doubling of current groundwater abstraction rates reduces annual discharge by approximately 20%, with higher reductions to low flows seen around 40%. The combined effects of climate change and increased groundwater abstraction result in the largest impact to low flow and annual discharge (+/-50% change). The relative and combined impacts on groundwater level and nitrate leaching from the root zone are also quantified and compared to assess the water resource sensitivity and risk to stream ecological conditions.",

The project focuses on the study of the electrical conductivity structure of the crust and upper mantle. An array of 70 synchronous long period and 236 broad-band MT sites were occupied in summers 2011 to 2013. Large synoptic arrays allows to estimate different magnetotelluric transfer functions, including inter-station transfer functions. We have run 3D inversion using Modular EM system of full impedance tensor, tipper vector and perturbation tensor simultaneously. As a result we have obtained more geologically meaningful results as compared to single transfer function inversion. The final model has less sharp details (smaller model norm). The presence of magnetic transfer functions makes inversion less prone to galvanic distortion influences. The array is located in high latitudes, hence the source field effect might be affecting estimates of transfer functions. In order to reduce the effect we have applied multivariate processing techniques to estimate all the transfer functions. Perturbation tensor is most noticeably affected by the source field therefore we had to exclude some sites and periods from the inversion to improve data fit. Overall we have obtained a consistent data fit for all the transfer functions.",

            "abstract": "Using some recent Plasma drift data at Arecibo, we present evidences of Electric Field (E) changes induced by sunrise and sunset transitions at both local and conjugate regions. Field perpendicular plasma drifts in the F region are used as unambiguous diagnostic of the Electric Field. The large time differences between the local ( 18.35 N, 66.75 W) and conjugate region (46.6 S, 64.7 W) sunrise and sunsets, particularly during the local winter at Arecibo,  allow identification of local and conjugate effects on the E field. We present evidences of a downward velocity started around the conjugate sunrise and reaching minimum around the local sunrise, when it turns around and merges with normal daytime behavior, controlled by the dynamo region. During sunset, the upward drift increase at local sunset and shows a dip at the conjugate sunset, when it turns around. Afterwards, the F region is isolated and behaves in regular night time fashion. The entire behavior can be explained by coupled behavior of the E and F region, where the terminator line switches the coupling and affects charge separation at the boundaries. Similar investigations using the summer data have been performed and confirm the interpretation of coupled electric circuit including the local and conjugate regions and intervening ionosphere along the field lines.\n ",

            "abstract": "Changes in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation play an important role in modulating global climate by controlling northward heat transport in the surface ocean and carbon storage in the deep ocean. However, the proportion of northern- and southern- sourced water masses filling the deep Atlantic during glacial conditions is not adequately constrained. We present new glacial Nd isotope measurements from cores throughout the Atlantic to examine whether there is an ocean-wide coherency to changes in deep water mass sourcing. The resulting profile reveals that, whilst less dominant than during interglacial conditions, northern-sourced waters were a substantial component of the deep glacial Atlantic. Comparison to benthic carbon isotopes shows that the low δ13C values seen in the deep North Atlantic at the LGM (Curry & Oppo, 2005) may in part be attributed to redissolution of organic matter, representing a sink of CO2 under glacial conditions.\nThis finding is corroborated by a new 1.5 Ma record of neodymium isotopes measured on uncleaned planktic foraminifera and fish debris from ODP Site 929 [6.0 °N, 43.7 °W, 4356 m] on the Ceara Rise in the western equatorial Atlantic Ocean. This record shows other glacial-interglacial circulation reorganizations were similar to the last deglaciation, including that which occurred during the Mid-Pleistocene Transition as defined by Elderfield et al. (Elderfield et al., 2012). The Nd isotope shifts broadly correlate with benthic foraminiferal δ13C and δ18O from the same core (Bickert et al., 1997), however periods of significant decoupling between δ13C and εNd, particularly during glacial periods, indicate that deep Atlantic water mass mixing proportions and nutrient chemistry can vary independently of one another.\n",

            "abstract": "Methyl mercury (MeHg) is a bioaccumulative toxicant. It was believed to be produced by sulfate (SO4)- and iron- reducing bacteria (SRB and FeRB), but recent studies suggest that organisms that possess the gene cluster (hgcAB) can methylate Hg, which includes other microbial groups besides SRB and FeRB. Many areas known to accumulate high levels of MeHg are freshwater wetlands that lack sufficient electron acceptors to support the production of MeHg. To test the hypothesis that oligotrophic wetlands are able to methylate Hg by pathways that are not respiratory, peat was collected from three wetland sites in Alaska and three in Massachusetts that represented a trophic gradient. We determined rates of gas (CH4, CO2, H2) and LMW organic acid (formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate) formation, and rates of Hg methylation using the short-lived radioisotope 197Hg (half life 2.67 days). Two temperate sites exhibited strong terminal respiration (methanogenesis) and syntrophy, while the Alaskan sites and an oligotrophic temperate site exhibited low rates of both. Primary fermentation was an important process in the latter sites. Hg methylation was most active at the minerotrophic sites that exhibited active syntrophy and methanogenesis. Methylation decreased greatly in the presence of a methanogenic inhibitor and was stimulated by H2 indicating that methanogens and perhaps syntrophs were primary methylators. In the oligotrophic sites, the addition of SO4 stimulated methylation while a SO4 reduction inhibitor decreased methylation. There was no evidence of SO4 reduction in these samples suggesting that methylation was conducted by SRB that were metabolizing via fermentation and not SO4 reduction. While further studies are required to decipher the role of syntrophs including SRB varieties such as Syntrophobacter sp., these results indicate that fermentative bacteria may be able to significantly methylate Hg in wetlands that do not support anaerobic respiration.",

            "abstract": "Since the 1960s terrestrial ecosystems have acted as a substantial sink for atmospheric CO2, sequestering about one quarter of anthropogenic emissions in an average year. Variations in this land carbon sink are also responsible for most of the large interannual variability in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. While most evidence places the majority of the sink in highly productive forests and at high latitudes experiencing warmer and longer growing seasons, the location and the processes governing the interannual variations are still not well characterised. Here we evaluate the hypothesis that the long-term trend and the variability in the land CO2 sink are respectively dominated by geographically distinct regions: the sink by highly productive lands, mainly forests, and the variability by semi-arid or “marginal” lands where vegetation activity is strongly limited by water and therefore responds strongly to climate variability. Using novel analysis methods and data from both upscaled flux-tower measurements and a dynamic global vegetation model, we show that (1) the interannual variability in the terrestrial CO2 sink arises mainly from variability in terrestrial gross primary production (GPP); (2) most of the interannual variability in GPP arises in tropical and subtropical marginal lands, where negative anomalies are driven mainly by warm, dry conditions and positive anomalies by cool, wet conditions; (3) the variability in the GPP of high-latitude marginal lands (tundra and shrublands) is instead controlled by temperature and light, with warm bright conditions resulting in positive anomalies. The influence of ENSO (El Niño-Southern Oscillation) on the growth rate of atmospheric CO2 concentrations is mediated primarily through climatic effects on GPP in marginal lands, with opposite signs in subtropical and higher-latitude regions. Our results show that the land sink of CO2 (dominated by forests) and its interannual variability (dominated by marginal lands) are largely decoupled in terms of both geographic locations and driving processes, and will respond in different ways to further increases in atmospheric CO2 levels and changes in climate.",

Whether it entered the interstellar medium proper or some other radically different region is still subject to debate, but observationally the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) intensities and anisotropies are still varying, apparently responding to heliospheric perturbations, and the region is certainly bearing little resemblance to the expected quiescent interstellar medium. Voyager 2 (V2) continues to push towards the outer boundary of the heliosheath, being in a region heavily influenced by the interstellar interaction, as evidenced by dramatically diverted plasma flows, measuring on average greater than 60 degrees from the radial. We have studied the anomalous cosmic ray (ACR) and GCR particle behavior using V1 and V2 Low Energy Charge Particle observations, beyond the termination shock, and report the largest measured ~3% second-order GCR anisotropy at V1 after the heliocliff crossing and the order-of-magnitude variations in ACR and GCR intensities at V2 (e.g., from 2007-2012). These V2 observations are dissonant with the steady intensity profiles seen at V1 during the same period in the heliosheath and are seemingly related to the proximity to the magnetically sectored heliosheath, which arises from the increasingly compressed heliospheric current sheet (HCS) folds. We extend our earlier post-heliocliff, V1 GCR anisotropy work to the entire the heliosheath (V1 and V2) and report on the relationship between particle intensities and newly released V2 magnetometer data, particularly in regard to the HCS location.",

This is mainly due to the intrinsic complex and nonlinear nature of climate-vegetation interactions, which is exerted over a wide range of space, temporal and frequency scales. Beside, traditional statistical tools applied to these feedbacks rely on linear correlation measures that can hardly distinguish the different components of these interactions.\nWe analyze monthly and sub-monthly globally gridded data of precipitation, temperature and NDVI (from both MODIS and AVHRR) by using an ensemble of different directional coupling statistics, and spectral metrics able to resolve cross-scale interactions.\nBased on the concept of Granger causality, we assess the bi-directional causal influences between precipitation, temperature and NDVI. In particular, we focus on spectral causality measures, in order to infer sub-processes acting across different time and frequency scales.\nSeveral examples from arid and semi-arid regions are introduced and examined. During the discussion of the result, we highlight the strength and weakness of the approach, also in the occurrence of nonlinear couplings.",

As the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index changed in 1999 as air-temp cooled, this study focused on pollen, land plant debris and insect scale fluxes at SA during 1998 to 2006. The max pollen and fern spores flux was a mean of 74 grains m2 d-1, and the following details: 65% of the total pollen counts represented by wind-pollinated trees (e.g., alder, birch and pine), 24% by the herbaceous plants (as herbs), and 11% by fern spores. Spore, herbaceous and wind-pollinated tree pollen (as wind-pollen) fluxes peaked in May and Sep-Oct, but flux peaks of the latter also occurred in April and Jun. The annual flux peaks of insect scales (of unknown origin) and land-plant debris were in May and Sep, but over the entire study period the max insect scale flux of 161 was in Aug 2002, with a mean of 16 scales m2d-1, while the max (in Aug 2004) and mean land-plant debris fluxes were 107 and 10 plant fragments m2d-1, respectively. The sediment traps are situated both side of the Aleutian Is., where snow and ice occurs from Oct to May. The ice-snow season accounts for 25% of the total annual particle flux in SA trap, with 75% throughout the rest of the year. The correlation coefficient among pollen, insect scales and land plant debris are: 1) 0.58 (p<1%) between wind-pollen and insect scales, 2) 0.75 (p<5%) between herb-pollen and land plant debris, 3) but only 0.14 between insect scales and herbaceous pollen. Thus, the production location, residence time, route and mode of transport of the particles are important factors. Normally, the wind-pollinated tree flowering season in the northern part of Alaska and Japan where are an upper stream to the stations is from Apr to Jun, with the pollen usually transported across the ocean by winds. Assuming that the pollen takes several months to arrive SA, the wind speed and direction during the summer months also need to be considered. The debris needs about 1 month to sink to the trap water depth. Accordingly, the pollen transported to the trap area in Apr, Aug and Sep, when local wind speeds are 8 to 13 m s-1, are represented by the fluxes in May, Sep and Oct. In summary, the wind-pollen and insect scales in SA appear to be conveyed by wind over long distances.",

Cosmogenic nuclides, which accumulate in rocks exposed at the earth’s surface, can be used to directly date the exposure age of the rock surfaces that have been created through glacial erosion or deposition. The technique requires a detailed understanding of the local geomorphology as well as awareness of the post-depositional processes that may affect the interpretation of exposure ages. Initial surface exposure ages (10Be, 26Al, 21Ne, and 36Cl ) from local limestone bedrock and other glacially deposited exotic lithologies provide a history spanning from 0 to 1.1 Ma in the Patriot, Independence, and Marble Hills in the southern Ellsworth Mountains, Antarctica. Using the new surface exposure ages combined with geomorphological mapping, we will discuss the implications for the glacial history of the southern Ellsworth Mountains.",

            "abstract": "Evidence for gas-solid reactions is found throughout the solar system: for example, sulfidation reactions in some meteorites and secondary phases coating lunar pyroclastic glasses. On Earth, the products of gas-solid reactions are documented in volcanic systems, metalliferous mineral deposits, impact craters, and on dust or meteorites after passage through the atmosphere - such reactions are also likely on the surfaces of Mars and Venus. To understand the chemical dynamics of such gas-solid reactions, we are undertaking systematic experiments and thermochemical modelling.\nExperiments were conducted in a vertical gas-mixing furnace at 600 – 800 °C and 1 bar, using SO2and a range of Ca-bearing materials: labradorite, feldspar glass and anorthosite (rock). In each case, anhydrite formed rapidly. In shorter experiments with labradorite, isolated anhydrite is observed surrounded by 'moats' of Ca-depleted silicate. In longer experiments, anhydrite is found as clusters of crystals that, in some cases, extend from the substrate forming precarious 'towers' (Figure). Anhydrite fills cracks in porous samples.\nWe propose that the nucleation and rapid growth of anhydrite on the surface of these Ca-rich phases occurs by chemisorption of SO2(g) molecules with slightly negatively charged oxygen onto available near-surface calcium with slight positive charge. Anhydrite growth is sustained by SO2(g) chemisorption and Ca migration through the reacting silicate lattice, accelerated by increased bond lengths at high temperature.\nSignificantly, the chemisorption reaction indicates that SO2 disproportionates to form both oxidized sulfur (as anhydrite) and a reduced sulfur species (e.g., an S* radical ion). On Earth, in the presence of H2O, the predominant reduced sulfur species is H2S, through an overall reaction:\n3CaAl2Si2O8 + 4 SO2(g)+ H2O(g) → 3CaSO4 + 3Al2SiO5 + 3SiO2 + H2S(g)\nThe reduced sulfur may react with gas phase Fe, Ni, Zn and Cu cluster compounds to form metal sulfides. This is observed on the km-scale through co-existing anhydrite and sulphide in porphyry copper deposits on Earth. Chemisorption reactions with S-gases may also be responsible for sulfide coatings on lunar glass beads; sulfate minerals with volcanic rocks on Mars (e.g., Home Plate); and putative sulfate minerals on Venus and the early Earth.",

            "abstract": "Measurements on a set of cold-water corals (mainly Desmophyllum dianthus) have suggested that their clumped isotope composition could serve as a promising proxy for reconstructing paleocean temperatures. Such measurements have also offered support for certain isotope models of coral calcification. However, there are differences in the clumped isotope compositions between warm-water and cold-water corals, suggesting that different kinds of corals could have differences in their biocalcification processes. In order to understand the systematics of clumped isotope variations in cold-water corals more fully, we present clumped isotope data from a range of cold-water coral species from the tropical Atlantic and the Southern Ocean.\nOur samples were either collected live or recently dead (14C ages < 1,000 yrs) with associated temperature data. They include a total of 11 solitary corals and 1 colonial coral from the Atlantic, and 8 solitary corals from the Southern Ocean. The data indicate that coral clumped isotope systematics may be more complicated than previously thought. For example, for the genus Caryophyllia we observe significant variations in clumped isotope compositions for corals which grew at the same temperature with an apparent negative correlation between Δ47 and δ18O, different to patterns previously observed in Desmophyllum. These results indicate that existing isotope models of biocalcification may not apply equally well to all corals. Clumped isotope vital effects may be present in certain cold-water corals as they are in warm-water corals, complicating the use of this paleoclimate proxy.",

            "abstract": "Extreme wind events are among the most damaging weather-related hazards in mid-latitudes. In forested areas, the windstorms cause frequent disturbances to the vegetation cover, which disrupts the landscape dynamics. In order to successfully run a landscape model dealing with such effects, spatial distribution of extreme wind speed statistics is needed. Suggested method employs the non-hydrostatic model WRF to dynamically downscale selected extreme wind events.\nThe events to be simulated were selected using classification of ERA Interim reanalysis pressure-level data at the center of the domain. The situations were clustered using the wind speed and direction at 850 hPa level and thermal stability expressed as temperature gradient between 850 hPa and 925 hPa levels. One representative event for each cluster was downscaled with WRF. Several parameterization schemes were tested for calculation of radiation and surface layer to properly address orographic effects in the domain. Finally, the results of simulation were statistically processed to obtain parameters of extreme value distribution in each grid point of the domain. In the landscape model, probability of windthrow was calculated from randomly generated annual maxima. The corresponding function was calibrated using data of real forest damage due to the extreme wind speed.\nThe method is demonstrated on the area of Bohemian Forest that represents one of largest and most compact forested mountains in Central Europe. The selected domain contains a professional meteorological station with suitable history of wind speed measurements. The observations were cleaned of inhomogeneity and classified to convective and non-convective cases using the index CAPE. The resulting dataset allowed validation and calibration of previously downscaled data. The simulation was also done for the storm Kyrill to be compared to the reported forest damage.",

            "abstract": "Iheya-North hydrothermal field situated in the middle Okinawa trough backarc basin is one of the largest ongoing Kuroko deposits in the world. Active chimneys as well as diffuse ventings (maximum fluid temperature 311 °C) have been located and studied in detail through various geological and geophysical surveys. To clarify the spatial scale of the hydrothermal circulation system, intensive heat flow measurements were carried out and ~100 heat flow data in and around the field from 2002 to 2014. In 2010, Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 331 was carried out, and subbottom temperature data were obtained around the hydrothermal sites. During the JAMSTEC R/V Kaiyo cruise, KY14-01 in 2014, Iheya-North “Natsu” and “Aki” hydrothermal fields were newly found. The Iheya-Noth “Natsu” and “Aki” sites are located 1.2 km and 2.6 km south from the Iheya-North original site, respectively, and the maximum venting fluid temperature was 317 °C. We obtained one heat flow data at the “Aki” site. The value was 17 W/m2. Currently, the relationship between these hydrothermal sites are not well known.\nThree distinct zones are identified by heat flow values within 3 km from the active hydrothermal field. They are high-heat flow zone (>1 W/m2; HHZ), moderate-heat-flow zone (1-0.1 W/m2; MHZ); and low-heat-flow zone (<0.1 W/m2; LHZ). With increasing distance east of the HHZ, heat flow gradually decreases towards MHZ and LHZ. In the LHZ, temperature at 37m below the seafloor (mbsf) was 6 °C, that is consistent with the surface low heat flow suggesting the recharge of seawater. However, between 70 and 90 mbsf, the coarser sediments were cored, and temperature increased from 25 °C to 40°C. The temperature was 905°C at 151 mbsf, which was measured with thermoseal strips. The low thermal gradient in the upper 40 m suggests downward fluid flow. We infer that a hydrothermal circulation in the scale of ~1.5 km horizontal vs. ~a few hundred meters vertical.",

            "abstract": "Shear-wave splitting from local earthquakes provides valuable knowledge on anisotropy of the upper crust. Upper-crustal anisotropy is widely interpreted as due to aligned fluid-filled cracks or pores. Differential stress is thought to close cracks aligned perpendicular to the maximum principal stress and leaves cracks open that are aligned perpendicular to the minimum horizontal compressional stress. In other cases local shear-wave splitting has been found to be aligned with regional faulting. Temporal variations in local splitting patterns might provide hints of changes in stress orientation related to earthquakes or volcanoes.\n North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ) is a large-scale continental strike slip fault system originating at the Karlıova Junction in the east where it intersects the East Anatolian Fault (EAF) and extends west cutting across the entire Northern Turkey towards the Aegean Sea and the mainland Greece. Our primary focus is to provide constraints on the crustal anisotropy beneath the western segment of the North Anatolian Fault Zone with the use of a data set collected from a dense temporary seismic network consisting of 70 stations that was deployed in early May 2012 and operated for 18 months in the Sakarya region and the surroundings during the Faultlab experiment. For the local shear wave splitting analysis, out of 1344 events, we extracted 90 well located earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 2.0. Local shear-wave splitting makes use of earthquakes close to and nearly directly below the recording station. Incidence angles of less than 45 degrees were used to avoid the free-surface effect and resulting non-linear particle motion. Basically, two essential parameters for each station-event pair is needed for shear wave splitting calculations. One of them is fast polarization direction (ɸ) and the other is delay time (δt) between the fast and slow components of the shear wave. In this study, delay times vary between 0,02 and 0,25 seconds clearly reveals the existence of crustal anisotropy. We are also going to attempt to correlate the fast directions obtained for the group of stations with the tectonic regime of the region taking into account these parameters.",

            "abstract": "Cenozoic volcanic outcrops in Arabia - locally known as harrats - span more than 2000 km along the western half of the Arabian plate, from eastern Yemen to southern Syria. The magmatism is bimodal in character, with older volcanics (30 to 20 My) being tholeiitic-to-transitional and paralleling the Red Sea margin, and younger volcanics (12 Ma to Recent) being transitional-to-strongly-alkalic and aligning in a more north-south direction. The bimodal character has been attributed to a two-stage rifting process along the Red Sea, where the old volcanics would have produced from shallow sources related to an initial passive rifting stage, and young volcanics would have originated from one or more deep-seated mantle plumes driving present active rifting. Early models suggested the harrats would have resulted from either lateral flow from the Afar plume in Ethiopia, or more locally from a separate mantle plume directly located under the shield. Most recently, tomographic images of the Arabian mantle have suggested the northern harrats could be resulting from flow originating at a deep plume under Jordan. In this work, we investigate the location of deep mantle plumes under the Arabian plate by mapping transition zone thickness with teleseismic receiver functions. The transition zone is bounded by seismic discontinuities, nominally at 410 and 660 km depth, originating from phase transitions in the olivine-normative component of the mantle. The precise depth of the discontinuities is strongly dependent on temperature and, due to the opposing signs of the corresponding Clapeyron slopes, positive temperature anomalies are expected to result in thinning of the transition zone. Our dataset consists of ~5000 low-frequency (fc < 0.25 Hz) receiver function waveforms obtained at ~110 broadband stations belonging to a number of permanent and temporary seismic networks in the region. The receiver functions were migrated to depth and stacked along a ~2000 km long record section displaying P-to-S conversions at seismic discontinuities under Western Arabia. Our results display a normal to thicker-than-average transition zone under the study area, suggesting thermal perturbations of the transition zone due to deep mantle upwellings under the western shield and/or Jordan are unlikely.",

In order to develop probabilistic regional climate information that represents the uncertainty in climate scenario experiments in Japan, we compared the physics ensemble experiments using the 60km global atmospheric model of the Meteorological Research Institute (MRI-AGCM) with multi-model ensemble experiments with global atmospheric-ocean coupled models (CMIP3) of SRES A1b scenario experiments. The MRI-AGCM shows relatively good skills particularly in tropics for temperature and geopotential height. Variability in surface air temperature of physical ensemble experiments with MRI-AGCM was within the range of one standard deviation of the CMIP3 model in the Asia region. On the other hand, the variability of precipitation was relatively well represented compared with the variation of the CMIP3 models. Models which show the similar reproducibility in the present climate shows different future climate change. We couldn’t find clear relationships between present climate and future climate change in temperature and precipitation.\nWe develop a new method to produce probabilistic information of climate change scenarios by weighting model ensemble experiments based on a regression model (Krishnamurti et al., Science, 1999). The method can be easily applicable to other regions and other physical quantities, and also to downscale to finer-scale dependent on availability of observation dataset. The prototype of probabilistic information in Japan represents the quantified structural uncertainties of multi-model ensemble experiments of climate change scenarios.\n Acknowledgments: This study was supported by the SOUSEI Program, funded by Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Government of Japan.",

Reconstruction of coccolithophores productivity is critical for understanding past climate change and defining past levels of atmospheric CO2. Upwelling systems, such as the one along the Iberian margin, are important carbon sinks. Using the coccolith Sr/Ca ratio, a recent geochemistry-based proxy, we reconstructed coccolithophores productivity changes during MIS 12 to 11 at IODP Sites U1385 and U1391, the latter closer to shore and under stronger upwelling influence. The MIS 12 is considered the most extreme glacial of the last 1 Myr and MIS 11 one of the longer lasting interglacial periods. Studying these two climatic extremes will allow a better constraining of the influence of upwelling on the coccolithophores community and understand their role in phytoplankton ecology and the carbon cycle. For a clear assessment the coccolith Sr/Ca data needs to be corrected for temperature and species composition changes and the extraction of these secondary influences were made using UK37 - SST and the coccolith community.\nResults for the Iberian margin showed higher coccolithophores productivity during the glacial period, and lower during the interglacial with an increasing trend during the glaciation and a steep decline during the deglaciation. Higher productivity during colder conditions might be associated to stronger winds that increased upwelling and/or the mixing of the upper water column and thus nutrient replenishment at the surface. These results will be placed into context of other proxy data from the Sites or region, e.g. TOC, total alkenones, diatom and coccolith abundances.",

            "abstract": "The major and minor sulfur isotope composition (δ34S and Δ33S) of pyrites preserved in ~2.65–2.5 billion-year-old (Ga) microbialites record localized oxygen production and consumption near the mat surface. These trends are preserved in two separate drill cores (GKF01 and BH1-Sacha) transecting the Campbellrand-Malmani carbonate platform (Ghaap Group, Transvaal Supergroup, South Africa; Zerkle et al., 2012; Izon et al., in review). Microbialite pyrites possess positive Δ33S values, plotting parallel to typical Archean trends (with a Δ33S/δ34S slope of ~0.9) but enriched in 34S by ~3 to 7‰. We propose that these 34S-enriched pyrites were formed from a residual pool of sulfide that was partially oxidized via molecular oxygen produced by surface mat-dwelling cyanobacteria. Sulfide, carrying the range of Archean Δ33S values, could have been produced deeper within the microbial mat by the reduction of sulfate and elemental sulfur, then fractionated upon reaction with O2 produced by oxygenic photosynthesis. Preservation of this positive 34S offset requires that: 1) sulfide was only partially (50­­–80%) consumed by oxidation, meaning H2S was locally more abundant (or more rapidly produced) than O2, and 2) the majority of the sulfate produced via oxidation was not immediately reduced to sulfide, implying either that the sulfate pool was much larger than the sulfide pool, or that the sulfate formed near the mat surface was transported and reduced in another part of the system. Contrastingly, older microbialite facies (> 2.7 Ga; Thomazo et al., 2013) appear to lack these observed 34S enrichments. Consequently, the onset of 34S enrichments could mark a shift in mat ecology, from communities dominated by anoxygenic photosynthesizers to cyanobacteria. Here, we test these hypotheses with new spatially resolved mm-scale trends in sulfur isotope measurements from pyritized stromatolites of the Vryburg Formation, sampled in the lower part of the BH1-Sacha core. Millimeter-scale heterogeneities within mat layers will help elucidate the nature of sulfur cycling within the mat, while simultaneously revealing short-term variability in atmospheric Δ36S/Δ33S signals (e.g., Farquhar et al., 2013).",

            "abstract": "High-quality magnetotelluric (MT) data were collected at 167 sites onshore in Northwestern Namibia within the framework of a project (SAMPLE) to investigate processes related to the breakup of Gondwana. The entire study area extents from the Walvis Ridge in the Atlantic Ocean and crosses onshore the Kaoko Belt and the western boundary of the Kongo Craton.\nThe surface expressions of prominent faults such as the Purros Shear Zone and the Three Palm Mylonite Zone of the Kaoko Belt are expressed in 2D models as zones of high electrical conductivity. A region where the Etendeka flood basalts outcrop in the Western Kaoko Zone appears as a 10-15 km deep reaching highly resistive feature. However, dimensionality and strike direction analysis of the data exhibit 3D effects.\nThe 3D inversion models reproduce the main structures obtained by 2D modelling but the spatial coherency of structures is better resolved. The Purros Shear Zone and the Three Palm Mylonite Zone appear in the 3D inversion models as zones of high electrical conductivity striking in NW-SE direction in the middle crust. Where the Walvis Ridge intersects with the continent, an upwelling of resistive structures indicates a modification of the middle crust, which seems be caused by a deeper anomaly which is not resolved with MT. The spatial extent and possible emplacement of the highly resistive material associated with the Etendeka flood basalts is more enigmatic as only a relatively confined region at upper- to mid-crustal levels seems to be affected. Most importantly, these Cretaceous flood basalt events did not affect or alter the high conductivity structures associated with the preexisting Proterozoic shear zones. Compared with other cratonic boundaries in Southern Africa and elsewhere the transition from the Kaoko Belt into the Kongo Craton is unusual as it is associated with an area of high conductivity at upper to mid crustal levels. As MT site coverage in this region is sparse, however, this observation may be due to a local anomaly. We also present maps showing major anomalies observed in gravimetric and magnetic data and results using these data as constraints for the 3D electrical conductivity inversions.",

            "abstract": "The study of fractured rocks is extremely important in a wide variety of research fields where the fractures and faults can represent either rapid access to some resource of interest or potential pathways for the migration of contaminants in the subsurface. Identification of their presence and determination of their properties are critical and challenging tasks that have led to numerous fracture characterization methods. Among these methods, cross-borehole flowmeter analysis aims to evaluate fracture connections and hydraulic properties from vertical-flow-velocity measurements conducted in one or more observation boreholes under forced hydraulic conditions. Previous studies have demonstrated that analysis of these data can provide important information on fracture connectivity, transmissivity, and storativity.\nEstimating these properties requires the development of analytical and/or numerical modeling tools that are well adapted to the complexity of the problem. Quantitative analysis of cross-borehole flowmeter experiments, in particular, requires modeling formulations that: (i) can be adapted to a variety of fracture and experimental configurations; (ii) can take into account interactions between the boreholes because their radii of influence may overlap; and (iii) can be readily cast into an inversion framework that allows for not only the estimation of fracture hydraulic properties, but also an assessment of estimation error. To this end, we present a new semi-analytical formulation for cross-borehole flow in fractured media that links transient vertical-flow velocities measured in one or a series of observation wells during hydraulic forcing to the transmissivity and storativity of the fractures intersected by these wells. Our model addresses the above needs and provides a flexible and computationally efficient semi-analytical framework having strong potential for future adaptation to more complex configurations. The proposed modeling approach is demonstrated in the context of sensitivity analysis for a relatively simple two-fracture synthetic problem, as well as in the context of field-data analysis for fracture connectivity and estimation of corresponding hydraulic properties.",

Fault-hosted hot springs and the acid chloride crater lakes had light δ11B (-2.4 to +0.49 ‰), similar to geothermal brines. Meanwhile, the δ11B values of volcanic-hosted hot springs ranged from -0.7 to +12.8 ‰ and acid-sulfate crater lakes ranged from +5.5 to +34.8 ‰, which were heavier than the geothermal vapor phase (δ11B= +3.8 ‰). The absence of magmatic gases and the fast ascent of the fault-hosted thermal waters inhibited B isotope fractionation, thus their original light δ11B signature from the reservoir was maintained. In contrast, in volcanic-hosted geothermal systems magmatic degassing produced a more reactive geothermal water, which combined with the relatively longer ascent produced heavy δ11B signatures. The light δ11B signature of acid chloride crater lakes was produced by rock dissolution, also indicated by its B/Cl ratios, which were similar to those of andesitic rocks. The continuous H2S, SO2 and HCl gases supply favors rock dissolution in the acid chloride crater lakes and thus little to no B isotope fractionation was observed. In contrast, condensation of the geothermal vapor phase combined with evaporation and B adsorption onto clay minerals caused a δ11B enrichment in the acid sulfate crater lakes. The very heavy δ11B value of +34.8 ‰ in the acid sulfate crater lake of Kawah Sikidang likely involved some reaction with sedimentary rocks in the subsurface.",

            "abstract": "Despite of the differences in the equations governing the dynamics of different ocean scalars (as SSH, SST, SSS, chlorophyll concentration, or sea roughness), visual inspection of remote sensing maps of these different ocean scalars reveals the existence of many common features. They always correspond with dynamic structures of the oceanic flow, such as eddies, filaments or upwelling areas. That consistent correspondence may be explained by the action of flow advection, which stretches and shears scalars along the most energetic streamlines.\nHorizontal advection does not only shape structures in scalars. Eddy transport and filament advection carry long away water masses with relatively homogeneous scalar properties, especially at areas of large Eddy Kinetic Energy. The signature of those water masses can be recognised as specific functional relations among the variables when joint histograms are computed. The repeated observation of particular arrangements of values of scalars allows identifying those water masses, similarly to what oceanographers do with T-S diagrams of vertical profiles. But processes at surface are more energetic than in the water column; hence, the value of scalars evolve very fast and there is not a permanent rule linking them, although for a given period one such relation may hold for a specific region.\nThe introduction of singularity analysis has meant a significant advancement in the description and understanding of the dynamic relations at ocean surface. Using singularity analysis, the Singularity Exponents (SE) of any scalar field can be calculated. SE are dimensionless variables linked to the structure of the underlying surface flow and not to the specific properties of the scalar from which they are derived. It has been shown that SE from different remote sensing scalars have very close values. This correspondence can be used to increase the signal to noise ratio of a given scalar, and even to extrapolate it into data gaps, using a different variable as a template of SE.\nIn this presentation we will show that SE are linked to the dynamics of ocean quasi-2D turbulence. We will also discuss on the dynamic interpretation of SE and how much we can know from currents, horizontal dispersion, etc using SE derived from remote sensing scalars. Finally, some examples of application are illustrated.",

            "abstract": "Krishna Godavari (K.G.) basin is a passive margin basin developed along the Eastern coast of India. This basin has a polyhistoric evolution with multiple rift systems. Rift basin exploration has provided the oil and gas industry with almost one third of discovered global hydrocarbon resources. Understanding synrift sequences, their evolution, depositional styles and hydrocarbon prospectivity has become important with recent discovery of the wells, G-4-6,YS-AF and KG-8 in the K.G. offshore basin. The East Godavari subbasin is a hydrocarbon producing basin from synrift and pre-rift sediments, and hence this was selected as the study area for this research. The study has been carried out by utilizing data of around 58 wells (w1-w58) drilled in the study area 25 of which are hydrocarbon bearing with organic thickness varying from 200 m to 600 m. Age data generated by palaentology and palynology studies have been utilized for calibration of key well logs to differentiate between formations within prerift and synrift sediments. The electrologs of wells like resistivity, gamma ray, neutron, density and sonic logs have been utilized for correlation of different formations in all the drilled wells. The individual thicknesses of sand, shale and coal in the formations have been calculated and tabulated. For Golapalli formation, the isopach and isolith maps were generated which revealed that there were four depocentres with input from the north direction. Schematic geological cross sections were prepared using the well data and seismic data to understand the facies variation across the basin. The sedimentological and petrophysical analysis reports and electro log suites were referred to decipher the environment of deposition, the reservoir characteristics, and play types. The geochemical reports [w4 (Tmax)= 455-468 °C; w1 (Tmax) = 467-514 °C; w4(VRO)= 0.65-0.85; w1(VRO)= 0.83-1.13] revealed the source facies, its maturation and migration timings i.e. the petroleum systems. It was concluded these fluvial channel systems constitute the main hydrocarbon play for the Mandapeta and Gollapalli formations and these channel systems if found at a structurally advantageous positions should prove to be good hydrocarbon targets.",

The rise of the sea level in Arctic was accompanied with present tectonic processes. Marine terraces are formed with the combination of eustatic sea level fluctuations and glacioisostatic uplift of the territory with the significant role of complicated tectonic block movements. There are nearly about 150 radiocarbon ages data for Franz-Josef Land archipelago now. The represented conclusions are a generalization of the published data and results of our field researches with series of new radiocarbon dates.\nWe managed to collect valuable factual material during the Russian Arctic National Park expedition in 2012. The distinctions of post-glacial rise of different islands and peculiarities of Holocene deglaciation were identified with the help of marine terraces analysis.\nThe altitude of the terraces with the same age on different islands exceeds 15 meters in some cases. However, analysis of the data suggests that the continuous series of raised beaches from 35 m a.s.l. formed during the last 10000 years. It is impossible to build up an univocal model of emergence isobases with the existing data.\nAlexandra Land Island was the special object of this investigation. The large beach ridge from Lunar Ice Cap to Kropotkina Ice Cap divides the island on two parts. The northern one is covered with marine sediments, whereas the southern – with glaciofluvial sediments with negligible areas of marine sediments. The difference between the terraces' ages of Alexandra Land on the Dezhneva Bay shore and the northern shore of island suggests that:\n1) In the early Holocene the rate of the transgression exceeded the tectonic uplift of the territory;\n2) Formation of the large central beach ridge occurred near 6700 years ago, the maximum marine limit in the Alexandra Land Island;\n3) The rate of the tectonic rise of the territory exceeded the eustatic sea level rise in the period after 6700 years ago;\n4) The formation of the large central beach ridge took place when the Ice Capes occupied less space than now.\nWe express our gratitude to the administration of Russian Arctic National Park for providing access to FJL archipelago and organization of the expedition.",

The southwest and northeast monsoons are the most important quasi permanent systems which dominate the weathers in this part of the world. The summer monsoon rainfall during the months June to September has a large temporal as well as spatial variability. The surface air temperature has also a large temporal and spatial variability. For suitable scientific analysis, the whole country can be divided into several homogeneous rainfall and temperature zones. Some of the extreme weather events occurring in the country include land slides, cold wave conditions, flash floods, cyclones, heat wave conditions, floods, droughts and heavy precipitation. In the context of climate change, in addition to these extreme cases, it is important to examine all the weather events above their respective threshold levels in terms of frequencies of occurrences. Results of this study show that the atmospheric surface temperature has enhanced in all the homogeneous regions of India with a maximum value of about 10C during winter and post-monsoon months. There is a significant seasonal asymmetry in the temperature rise. Also extreme temperature events of different types have enhanced over all the regions. It is found that the total precipitation during the summer monsoon months of June to September does not show any statistically significant trend. However, the numbers of short spell high intensity rain events and dry spells have increased in the last half century. Long spell rain events, on the other hand, show decreasing trend. The decrease in the number of long spell rain events associated with similar tendencies in the number of monsoon depressions, the mean monsoon wind and its shears over India suggests that the Indian summer monsoon circulation might be weakening. This talk will also attempt to describe the changes in temperature and rainfall extremes and their projections at some selected locations in the country based on the coordinated international programme CORDEX and some results obtained from the integration of the regional climate model RegCM4.3 concerning the weakening of Indian summer monsoon.",

            "abstract": "Geophysical applications require efficient forward models for non-linear Stokes flow on high resolution spatio-temporal domains. The bottleneck in applying the forward model is solving the linearized, discretized Stokes problem which takes the form of a large, indefinite (saddle point) linear system.\nDue to the heterogeniety of the effective viscosity in the elliptic operator, devising effective preconditioners for saddle point problems has proven challenging and highly problem-dependent. Nevertheless, at least three approaches show promise for preconditioning these difficult systems in an algorithmically scalable way using multigrid and/or domain decomposition techniques. The first is to work with a hierarchy of coarser or smaller saddle point problems. The second is to use the Schur complement method to decouple and sequentially solve for the pressure and velocity. The third is to use the Schur decomposition to devise preconditioners for the full operator. These involve sub-solves resembling inexact versions of the sequential solve. The choice of approach and sub-methods depends crucially on the motivating physics, the discretization, and available computational resources.\nHere we examine the performance trade-offs for preconditioning strategies applied to idealized models of mantle convection and lithospheric dynamics, characterized by large viscosity gradients. Due to the arbitrary topological structure of the viscosity field in geodynamical simulations, we utilize low order, inf-sup stable mixed finite element spatial discretizations which are suitable when sharp viscosity variations occur in element interiors.\nParticular attention is paid to possibilities within the decoupled and approximate Schur complement factorization-based monolithic approaches to leverage recently-developed flexible, communication-avoiding, and communication-hiding Krylov subspace methods in combination with `heavy' smoothers, which require solutions of large per-node sub-problems, well-suited to solution on hybrid computational clusters.\nTo manage the combinatorial explosion of solver options (which include hybridizations of all the approaches mentioned above), we leverage the modularity of the PETSc library.",

Vlasiator solves for ions in 6-dimensional phase space using the Vlasov equation and for electrons as a massless charge-neutralizing fluid using the magnetohydrodynamic equations. The code is therefore able to capture the kinetic physics absent in global MHD simulations. We run Vlasiator in a 5-dimensional setup with a fully 3-dimensional velocity space and two-dimensional (equatorial) plane. We present results from several runs, with various interplanetary magnetic field directions, including a typical Parker spiral orientation as well as radial IMF. We investigate the formation, evolution and advection of the mirror modes in the magnetosheath. We also study how the wave field variations depend on the IMF cone angle. Simulation results indicate that the mirror mode type waves are generated behind the bow shock close to the foreshock edge. The waves then advect towards the quasi-perpendicular flanks of the magnetosheath. Additionally, we look at the evolution of the ion velocity distributions and how they depend on the mirror modes along streamlines in the magnetosheath.

            "abstract": "Developing predictive models of multiphase flow and reactive transport and multiphase flow at the pore scale is a challenge common to diverse science areas. Increasingly, it has become more important in subsurface flow and transport research due to its relevance to research areas such as contaminant and colloidal transport and multiphase flow. Goals of pore-scale simulations include identification of key parameters and physicochemical processes controlling macroscopic phenomena, validation of continuum descriptions, and determination of appropriate forms of the continuum formulation for approximation of the pore-scale results. Numerical modeling of pore-scale (multiphase) flow and transport is an active research area. However, with the exception of a few studies, direct comparisons between pore-scale experiments and simulations have been limited. Some of the reasons experimental data have not been used extensively so far to test pore-scale models are related to quality and reproducibility issues with available micromodels. However, rapid advances in microfabrication and imaging have led to the development of experimental procedures ensuring high quality, reproducible results. Several of these advances have been implemented in the new microfluidics laboratory at the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL) at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). In this contribution, recently obtained benchmark data sets for nonreactive transport, reactive transport, and multiphase flow are discussed. The data sets are offered to pore-scale numerical modelers for testing and validation purposes.",

            "abstract": "Cryosat-2 offers the first ever possibility to perform coastal altimetric studies using bor SAR-altimetry and SAR-In altimetry. With this technological leap forward Cryosat-2 is now able to observe sea level in very small water bodies and also to provide coastal sea level very close to the shore. We perform an investigation into the retrieval of sea surface height around Denmark and Greenland. These regions have been chosen as the coastal regions around Denmark falls within the SAR mask and the coastal regions of Greenland falls in under the SAR-in mask employed on Cryosat-2. SAR-in was mainly used in coastal regions of Greenland because of its huge topographic changes as Cryosat-2 is designed to map the margins of the ice-sheet. The coastal region around Denmark is a test region of the EU FP7 sponsored project LOTUS esablishing SAR altimetry product in preparation for Sentinel-3. With the increased spatial resolution of Cryosat-2 SAR we provide valuable sea level observations within the Straits around Denmark which are crucial to constrain the waterflow in and out of the Baltic Sea. The investigation of SAR-in data in Greenland adds an entire new dimension to coastal altimetry. An amazing result of the investigation is the ability of Cryosat-2 to detect and recover sea level even though the coast (sealevel) is up to 15 km away from the nadir location of the satellite. This ability of capture and use returns from outside the main (-3Db) loop in theory enables Cryosat-2 SAR-in to map sea level height of fjords more frequently than the 369 days repeat.",

Unsaturated zone flow processes are a dominant control on contaminant loading. However, the presence of unsaturated zone heterogeneity results in spatially and temporally variable flow pathways, due to capillary breaks and hydraulic barriers forming in various locations. This can result in the development of focused flow paths from where rapid contaminant transport to the water table may occur. In this study we designed an intensive monitoring program to attempt to characterise time-varying flow paths through a highly heterogeneous unsaturated zone through a dense network of combined soil moisture, electric conductivity and temperature probes. Estimations of surface fluxes and soil drainage along with observed water table response at a waste management site in Chalk River, Canada are presented providing insights into flow and transport processes.",

In particular, the post-eruption arcade and the CME flux rope are formed out of the same reconnection process. It is customary to compute the flare reconnection flux from the flare-ribbon area and photospheric/chromosphericmagnetic field strength. Here we report on a new method to compute the reconnection flux from post-eruption arcades (PEAs). Instead of counting the ribbon pixels in a series of images, we simply measure the area under PEAs after the flare maximum and the underlying photospheric magnetic field. The reconnection flux is then half of the product of these two quantities. We illustrate this method using specific examples and show that the ribbon and arcade methods yield very similar results. We show that this method provides a simple means of predicting the 1-AU flux rope magnetic field (including Bz) from measurements made near the Sun.",

            "abstract": "Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are ubiquitous trace components of the atmosphere, arising from a variety of natural and anthropogenic sources. Their wide range of lifetimes and specific source signatures make VOCs useful indicators of source region, photochemical histories and transport timescales of air masses. This is particularly true of the C2-C5non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs), which are predominantly anthropogenic in origin, have relatively well-known emission ratios, and lifetimes ranging from days to months. NMHCs are also frequently measured in an ensemble analysis, as is the case for whole air samples collected during deployments of the CARIBIC observatory (Civil Aircraft for the Regular Investigation of the atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container; www.caribic-atmospheric.com). Since 2005 the CARIBIC observatory operates from onboard a Lufthansa Airlines A340-600, where it is deployed monthly to make detailed observations of the atmosphere during a series of 2-6 long-distance commercial flights. The container operates at aircraft cruise altitudes of 10-12 km, placing the observations primarily in the upper troposphere and lowermost stratosphere (UT/LS).\nThere is a dearth of information about distributions of VOCs in the UT/LS, and data is generally restricted to measurements during short-term field campaigns. However, when data are available, VOC studies have proven to be well-suited to investigations in the UT/LS, where air masses are remote from sources and background air is relatively homogeneous. Here we take advantage of the over 5000 measurements of VOCs from air samples collected during nearly 10 years of CARIBIC flights in order to better understand transport and chemistry in the tropopause region. First, we use NMHC observations to identify “hot spots” for rapid transport of boundary layer air to the UT via convection or warm conveyor belts by examining the relationships of shorter-lived species to longer-lived ones and comparison to background air. Similarly, observations in the LS are used to identify instances of rapid transport across the mid-latitude tropopause and to estimate timescales of these processes. Finally, we complement our NMHC analysis with observations of CH3Cl and demonstrate its utility as a tracer for tropical air in the mid-latitude LS.",

            "abstract": "We present a novel approach that combines kinetic (diffusion) and thermodynamic (MELTS) modelling of the compositional zoning preserved in 180 olivines crystals to constrain the nature and evolution of the plumbing system beneath Mt. Etna over the last 17 years (1991-2008).\nThough the observed olivine compositions span a wide range and show an apparently chaotic heterogeneity we were able to identify five distinct populations. These can be explained as the result of multistage magma mixing and magma exchange between five different magmatic environments (MEs): M0 (=Fo79-83), M1 (=Fo75-78), M2 (=Fo70-72), M3 (=Fo65-69) and mm1 (=Fo73-75). Application of diffusion modelling to the zoned olivine populations allowed us to access typical timescales and durations over which crystals (and melt) are transferred between the different MEs.\nWe could identify pre-and syn-eruptive recharge of multiple pulses of primitive M0 (=Fo79-83)-type magma into different sections of the plumbing system. A detailed analysis of all possible connectivity patterns revealed that three dominant magma migration pathways connecting the MEs M0:M1, M2:mm1 and M1:M2 with each other have been active for most of the eruptive episodes. Because these migration routes are common to all eruption products we infer that they represent robust and long-term features of Etna’s plumbing system. We also find minor migration routes connected to more evolved MEs such as M3 (=Fo65-69). We found that two characteristic timescales describe the transfer of magma along the three dominant migration routes: M0:M1, M2:mm1 and M1:M2.\nThe recharge of the MEs M1 and M2 commence with minor pulses that begin months or even years (up to 2 years) before an eruptive event. This recharge activity gets more frequent in the weeks and days prior to eruptive activity. The recharge of the ME mm1 is characterized by short timescales of less than 40 days. These short timescales underpin the transient character of the ME mm1.\nCombining these results with thermodynamic modelling using the MELTS software [1, 2], we found that water content, and possibly oxidation state, are the main distinguishing features of the different MEs.\n[1] Ghiorso, M.S. & Sack, R.O.

            "abstract": "Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) is working on a conceptual study of altimeter mission named Coastal and Ocean measurement Mission with Precise and Innovative Radar Altimeter (COMPIRA), which will carry a wide-swath altimeter named Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Height Imaging Oceanic Sensor with Advanced Interferometry (SHIOSAI). Capturing meso/submeso-scale phenomena is one of important objectives of the COMPIRA mission, as well as operational oceanography and fishery. For operational oceanography including coastal forecast, swath of SHIOSAI is selected to be 80 km in left and right sides to maximize temporal and spatial sampling of the sea surface height. Orbit specifications are also designed to be better sampling especially for mid-latitude region. That is, a spatial grid sampling is 5 km and an observation times per revisit period (about 10 days) is 2 to 3 times. In order to meet both sampling frequency and spatial coverage requirements as much as possible, orbit inclination was set relatively low, 51 degrees. Although this sampling frequency is, of course, not enough high to capture time evolution of coastal phenomena, an assimilation process would compensate its time evolution if 2D SSH fields was observed at least once within decal time scale of phenomena.\nJAXA has launched a framework called “Coastal forecast core team” to aim at developing coastal forecast system through pre-launch activities toward COMPIRA. Assimilation segment as well as satellite and in situ data provision will play an important role on these activities. As a first step, we evaluated effects of ocean current forecast improvement with COMPIRA-simulated wide-swath and high sampling sea surface heights (SSH) data. Simulated SSH data are generated from regional ocean numerical models and the COMPIRA orbit and error specifications. Then, identical twin experiments are conducted to investigate the effect of wide-swath SSH measurements on coastal forecast in the Tohoku Pacific coast region. The experiment shows that simulated sea surface current using COMPIRA data as an input data for assimilation well represents vortical feature, which cannot be reproduced by conventional nadir altimeters.",

RIMFAX will add a new dimension to the rover’s toolset by providing the capability to image the shallow subsurface beneath the rover. The principal goals of the RIMFAX investigation are to image subsurface layering and structure, and to provide information regarding subsurface composition. Depending on materials, RIMFAX will image the subsurface stratigraphy to maximum depths of 10 to 500 meters, with vertical resolutions of 5 to 20 cm, with a horizontal sampling distance of 2 to 20 cm along the rover track. The resulting radar cross sections will provide important information on the geological context of surface outcrops as well as the geological and environmental history of the field area. The radar uses a Gated FMCW waveform and a single ultra wideband antenna that is used both for transmitting and receiving. The presentation will give an overview of the RIMFAX investigation, the radar system and show experimental results from a prototype radar.",

            "abstract": "Following heavy rainfall on 4/1/14, a debris flow at Slip Stream (44.59 S 168.34 E) introduced >106 m3 of sediment to the Dart River valley floor in NZ Southern Alps. Runout over an existing fan dammed the Dart River causing a sudden drop in discharge downstream. This broad dam was breached quickly; however the temporary loss of conveyance impounded a 3 km lake with a volume of 6 x 106 m3 and depths that exceed 10 m. Quantifying the impact of this large sediment pulse on the Dart River is urgently needed to assess potential sedimentation downstream and will also provide an ideal vehicle to test theories of bed wave migration in large, extensively braided rivers. Recent advances in geomatics offer the opportunity to study these impacts directly through the production of high-resolution DEMs. These 3D snapshots can then be compared through time to quantify the morphodynamic response of the channel as it adjusts to the change in sediment supply. In this study we describe the methods and results of a novel survey strategy designed to capture of the complex morphology of the Dart River along a remote 40 km reach, from the upstream landslide source to its distal sediment sink in Lake Wakatipu. The scale of this system presents major logistical and methodological challenges, and hitherto would have conventionally be addressed with airborne laser scanning, bringing with it significant deployment constraints and costs. By contrast, we present sub-metre 3D reconstructions of the system (Figure 1), derived from highly redundant aerial photography shot with a non-metric camera from a helicopter survey that extended over an 80 km2 area. Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry was used to solve simultaneously camera position, pose and derive a 3D point cloud based on over 4000 images. Reconstructions were found to exhibit significant systematic error resulting from the implicit estimation of the internal camera orientation parameters, and we show how these effects can be minimized by optimizing the lens calibration before and after scene reconstruction using both external constraints and refined camera models. An analysis of DEM uncertainty, undertaken through comparison with long-range TLS data, demonstrates the potential for this low-cost survey strategy to generate models superior to conventional laser swath mapping even over large areas.",

            "abstract": "Microbial activity is a very important, and possibly even the dominant, reduction mechanism for many metals in natural water systems. Isotope fractionations during microbial metal reduction can reflect one major mechanism in metal cycling in the environment, and isotopic signatures can be used to identify and quantify reduction processes during biogeochemical cycling in the present environment as well as in the past. There are many Cr (VI)-reducing bacteria that have been discovered and isolated from the environment, and Cr isotopes were found to be fractionated during microbial reduction processes. In this study, Cr reduction experiments have been undertaken to determine the conditions under which Cr is reduced and the corresponding isotope signals that are generated. The experiments have been done with a facultative bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens LB 300, and several parameters that have potential impact on reduction mechanisms have been investigated. Electron donors are important for bacteria growth and metabolism. One factor that can control the rate of Cr reduction is the nature of the electron donor. The results show that using citrate as an electron donor can stimulate bacteria reduction activity to a large extent; the reduction rate is much higher (15.10 mgˑL-1hour-1) compared with experiments using glucose (6.65 mgˑL-1ˑhour-1), acetate (4.88 mgˑL-1hour-1) or propionate (4.85 mgˑL-1hour-1) as electron donors. Groups with higher electron donor concentrations have higher reduction rates. Chromium is toxic, and when increasing Cr concentrations in the medium, the bacteria reduction rate is also higher, which reflects bacteria adapting to the toxic environment. In the natural environment, under different pH conditions, bacteria may metabolise in different ways. In our experiments with pH, bacteria performed better in reducing Cr (VI) when pH = 8, and there are no significant differences between groups with pH = 4 or pH = 6. To investigate this further, Cr isotope determinations will be presented, which are essential in better understanding bacterial reducing activities under different environmental conditions and can also provide important background information for interpreting Cr isotope fractionations in natural environment, and using Cr isotopes to identify reduction by microbial activity.",

            "abstract": "Drinking water supply on the island of Langeoog, North Sea, solely depends on groundwater from a freshwater lens. The correct estimation of the recharge rate is critical for a sustainable use of the resource. Extensive hydrogeological and geophysical studies have revealed differences in groundwater recharge by a factor of two and more between the top of the dunes and the dune valleys. The most convincing proof of these differences in recharge is based on isotope analysis (age dating) but boreholes are scarce and a direct proof of recharge is desired. For this purpose active infiltration experiments are performed and geophysically monitored. Former applications of this method in sand and loess soil gave evidence for the applicability of the geophysical observation when combined with tensiometers installed in situ at depth. These results showed firstly that in sandy soil the water reaches the groundwater table quicker than anticipated due to the water repellent characteristic of the dry sand, inhibiting the lateral spreading of the water. The studies also revealed that in loess preferential flow is initiated by ponding and that sprinkling caused very slow movement of water within the unsaturated zone and the water remained near the surface. On the island of Langeoog field experiments underlined the importance of water repellency on the dune surface, indicating that the rain water runs off superficially into the dune valleys where higher recharge is found. The active infiltration zone of the experiment covers an area of some 7m² and includes steeper parts of the dune. The infiltration will vary depending on rainfall intensity and duration, original water content and vegetation cover. What results can we reliably expect from the active experiment and what additional measurements are required to back up the findings? Results are ambiguous with regard to the quantitative assessment but the processes can be visualized by geophysical monitoring in situ.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater flow in fractured basement rocks on aquifer scale and processes involved in the creation of fracture network permeability are poorly understood even though they have been studied for decades. A unique hydrogeological dataset from mining activities of the uranium producer in former East-Germany SDAG Wismut has been compiled and quantitatively interpreted. In this presentation we focus on data from the Poehla ore mine where a total of about 800 preferential groundwater inflows to about 115 km of drifts and 12 km of boreholes could be analysed down to a depth of 900 m below ground surface. The dataset consists of localized inflow rates, petrography of the host rock, mineralogy of the fracture infill, hydrochemical measurements, structural information and periodic cumulative inflow measurements to larger mine sections. Transmissivities in range of 3E-4 m2/s and 4E-13 m2/s were calculated from the inflow measurements using simplified analytical approximations and show no distinct depth-dependency. Highest inflows correlate with steeply dipping and preferentially NW-SE-oriented fractures, which is a direction prone for shearing. Most transmissive fractures show calcareous infill material or no mineralization. Equivalent block permeabilities were calculated by integration of inflow over 100 m long drift sections. Rock-matrix hydraulic conductivities were estimated from humidity transfer by ventilation for intervals without discrete inflows. The 100 m-block permeability shows a decreasing trend with depth due to increasing number of intervals not exhibiting distinct inflows. The derived permeabilities were successfully verified for 2 mine levels (~300 m and ~550 m below surface) with cumulative inflow data and a simplified axisymmetric, numerical, steady-state model. As the structural and mineralogical mine inventory is also very well documented, a GoCad model has been set up and multivariate statistical analyses in 3D will be conducted to investigate spatial correlations between fracture transmissivity and local mineralogic-tectonic conditions. These correlations shall aid in the understanding of processes creating and destructing permeability of fractured rocks at various depth.",

In performing our study, we develop and use our low order physics based nonlinear model of the magnetosphere called WINDMI to establish the global energy exchange between the solar wind, magnetosphere and ionosphere by constraining the model results to satellite and ground measurements. On the other hand, we make quantitative and qualitative comparisons between our low order model with available MHD, multi-fluid and ring current simulations in terms of the energy transfer between the geomagnetic tail, plasma sheet, field aligned currents, ionospheric currents and ring current, during isolated substorms, storm time substorms, and sawtooth events. We use high resolution solar wind data from the ACE satellite, measurements from the CLUSTER and THEMIS missions satellites, and ground based magnetometer measurements from SUPERMAG and WDC Kyoto, to further develop our low order physics based model.\n Finally, we attempt to answer the following questions: 1) What conditions in the solar wind influence the type of substorm event. This includes the IMF strength and orientation, the particle densities, velocities and temperatures, and the timing of changes such as shocks, southward turnings or northward turnings of the IMF. 2) What is the state of the magnetosphere ionosphere system before an event begins. These are the steady state conditions prior to an event, if they exist, which produce the satellite and ground based measurements matched to the WINDMI model. 3) How does the prior state of the magnetosphere influence the transition into a particular mode of behavior under solar wind forcing. 4) Is it possible to classify the states of the magnetosphere into distinct categories depending on pre-conditioning, and solar wind forcing conditions? 5) Can we predict the occurrence of substorms with any confidence?",

            "abstract": "During the Spanish Malaspina oceanic expedition, a total of 20 surface drifting buoys, manufactured by the Institut de Ciències del Mar (ICM) of the Spanish Council of Scientific Research (CSIC), were deployed. First developed in 2005, the various prototypes of these drifting buoys have been characterized by: 1) take measurements as close as 40 cm below the sea surface; 2) transmitting in real-time through several satellite networks; 3) long-lasting (about two years) energy source; 4) modular structure designed to host several sensors; 5) low-cost; and 6) small size.\nSince the mid 2000s, the deployment of the Argo automatic buoys is providing a quasi-global picture of the subsurface temperature and salinity structure. Currently, more than 3300 automatic profilers gather more than 9000 vertical profiles each month. However, few data just below the surface is being gathered by Argo because, to reduce the risk of sensor fouling, the pumping mechanism is switched off few meters before reaching the surface.\nRecently, two satellite missions (the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity, SMOS, of the European Space Agency, and Aquarius of National Aeronautics and Space Administration) have become a promising strategy to recover information about the sea surface salinity (SSS). Both instruments exploit the fact that significant information on sea surface dielectric properties (related to salinity) can be retrieved from ocean microwave emissions, particularly on L-band. With them, a new set of data may provide reliable information of the skin-depth surface salinity (Font et al. 2011). Three gridded products are currently being produced by the SMOS Barcelona Expert Centre (SMOS-BEC): i) binned weighted-average, ii) optimal interpolation; iii) Data fusion with OSTIA SST. In the SMOS -BEC, the validation of the SMOS salinity products has been carried out exclusively using Argo data.\nTo fill the bridge between the skin depth (one cm penetration depth) of the satellite measurements and the uppermost reliable measures (between 5 and 10 meters below the surface) from the Argo floats, a new generation of surface drifters has been designed and deployed in various oceans of the world. Here the drifters deployed during Malaspina Campaign, and their impact in the validation of the various SMOS prodcts, are described.",

            "abstract": "Water vapor isotope ratios are critical in shaping the isotopic composition of paleo-proxies used to interpret past climate. Indeed, previous research suggests speleothems are sensitive to water vapor transport, and experiments currently underway are evaluating the role of Greenlandic vapor in setting the isotopic record of the ice sheet. The recent and rapid spread of commercial vapor isotopic analyzers—based on cavity-enhanced near-infrared laser absorption spectroscopy—is creating unparalleled opportunities to elucidate which climatic factors control the vapor isotopic composition globally. This presentation describes both an exciting application of this new technology and relevant limitations imposed by measurement uncertainties associated with long-term field deployments. Using three years of continuous water vapor isotope ratio observations from Hawaii’s Mauna Loa Observatory—one of the longest records of its kind—we evaluate the influence of large-scale dynamics and cloud microphysical processes in establishing the isotopic composition of water vapor during strong convective activity. Despite the fact that vapor isotope ratios tend to decrease with latitude, greater enrichment in Mauna Loa vapor is associated with a westward retraction of the jet stream, which funnels Asiatic outflow southward, while greater depletion is associated with southwesterly low-level flow. Differences in precipitation efficiency—which are verified by differences in aerosol concentration and total scattering—cause this apparent discrepancy. These results suggest local cloud and precipitation processes are more influential than airmass origin in setting the isotope ratios observed during these strong convective events. The length of the Mauna Loa record, meanwhile, presents a unique opportunity to evaluate long-term stability of biases associated with laser-based isotopic analyzers and to discuss calibration strategies best suited for monitoring programs designed to evaluate transient relationships between isotopic and climatic variability.",

            "abstract": "One of the most pressing questions with regard to climate feedback processes in a warming Arctic is the regional-scale greenhouse gas release from Arctic permafrost areas. Ground-based eddy covariance (EC) measurements provide continuous in-situ observations of the surface-atmosphere exchange of energy and matter. However, these observations are rare in the Arctic permafrost zone and site selection is bound by logistical constraints among others. Consequently, these observations cover only small areas that are not necessarily representative of the region of interest. Airborne measurements can overcome this limitation by covering distances of hundreds of kilometers over time periods of a few hours. The Airborne Measurements of Methane Fluxes (AIRMETH) campaigns are designed to quantitatively and spatially explicitly address this question. During the AIRMETH-2012 and AIRMETH-2013 campaigns aboard the research aircraft POLAR 5 we measured turbulent exchange of energy, methane, and (in 2013) carbon dioxide along thousands of kilometers covering the North Slope of Alaska and the Mackenzie Delta, Canada. Time-frequency (wavelet) analysis, footprint modeling, and machine learning techniques are used to (i) determine spatially resolved turbulence statistics, fluxes, and contributions of biophysical surface properties, and (ii) extract regionally valid functional relationships between environmental drivers and the observed fluxes. These environmental response functions (ERF) are used to explain spatial flux patterns and – if drivers are available in temporal resolution – allow for spatio-temporal scaling of the observations. This presentation will focus on 2012 methane fluxes on the North Slope of Alaska and the relevant processes on the regional scale and provide an updated 100 m resolution methane flux map of the North Slope of Alaska.",

CL3 core (200m long) was drilled from 1) upper part of Black Shale Member (35m thick) to 2) lower part of BIF Member (165m thick) of the Cleaverville Formation. Here, the BIF Member can be divided into three submembers; Greenish shale-siderite (50m thick), Magnetite-siderite (55m thick) and Black shale-siderite (60m) submembers. In this study, we used bulk samples and samples treated by hot hydrochloric acid in order to extract organic carbon.\nThe Black shale Member consists of black carbonaceous　matter and fine grain quartz (< 100μm). Organic carbon content (Corg) of black shale is 1.2% in average and organic carbon isotope ratio (δ13Corg) is -31.4 to -28.7‰. On the other hand, inorganic carbon isotope ratio of siderite (δ13Ccarb) was -5.2 to +12.6‰.\nIn the BIF Member, the Greenish shale-siderite submember is composed of well laminated greenish sideritic shale and white chert (<7mm thick), which is gradually increase from black shale of the Black shale Member through about 10m. Magnetite-siderite submember contains very fine magnetite lamination with inter-bedded greenish sideritic shale and siderite lamination. Hematite is identified near fractured part. The Black shale-siderite submember is composed of black shale, siderite and chert bands.\n1) Siderite layers of these three submembers showedδ13Ccarb value of -14.6 to -3.8‰. Corg and δ13Corg content are 0.2% and -18.3 to -0.3‰. 2) Siderite grains within greenish sideritic shales showedδ13Ccarb value of -12.9 to +15.0‰. 3) Black shale of Corg and δ13Corg content in the BIF Member are 0.1% and -36.3 to -17.1‰ respectively.\nWe found great difference in values of δ13Ccarb of siderite. One is Corg-rich shale (up to +15.0‰) and the other is Corg-poor siderite layers (up to -3.8‰). The lighter value of siderite layers may be originated from precursor organic carbon which is strongly affected by biological activity.",

This allows for a more extensive study of subduction that, in contrast to the numerous regional models, incorporates the complete framework of mantle convection.\nHere, we focus on different aspects of mantle convection including (i) slab dip variations, (ii) variations in radial mantle viscosity, and (iii) the presence of localised mantle upwellings and discuss their control on the dynamics of Earth-like plate tectonics. Additionally, we present the effect these parameter variations have on measurable quantities like dynamic topography and plate velocity.\nThe models are calculated by the finite-volume code Stag-YY (e.g., Tackley 2008) using a multi-grid method on a fully staggered grid. Second, the sticky-air method (Matsumoto and Tomoda 1983; Schmeling et al, 2008) is applied and thus approximates a free surface when the sticky-air parameters are chosen carefully (Crameri et al., 2012b).\nOverall, this study demonstrates the ability of various parameters to significantly influence both subduction dynamics and surface topography.\nREFERENCES\nCrameri, F., et al.

            "abstract": "Many researches in climate change currently involve linear trends, based on measured variables. And many of them only consider trends in mean values, whereas it is clear, that not only means, but also whole shape of distribution changes over time and requires careful assessment. For example extreme values including outliers may get bigger, while median has zero slope.\nQuantile regression provides a convenient tool, that enables detailed analysis of changes in full range of distribution by producing a vector of quantile trends for any given set of quantiles.\nWe have applied quantile regression to surface air temperature observations made at over 600 weather stations across Russian Federation during last four decades. The results demonstrate well pronounced regions with similar values of significant trends in different parts of temperature value distribution (left tail, middle part, right tail). The uncertainties of quantile trend estimations for several spatial patterns of trends over Russia are estimated and analyzed for each of four seasons.\nFor temperature trend estimation over vast territories, quantile regression is an effort consuming approach, but is more informative than traditional instrument, to assess decadal evolution of temperature values, including evolution of extremes.\nPartial support of ERA NET RUS ACPCA joint project between EU and RBRF 12-05-91656-ЭРА-А is highly appreciated.",

            "abstract": "Deformation along major strike-slip faults is typically focussed into narrow damage zones at the surface, but the distribution at greater depths is more enigmatic. For instance, deformation in the lower crust beneath these faults is often attributed to much broader ductile shear zones. Deciphering how strain is distributed throughout the crust and lithospheric mantle is important because it has ramifications on the earthquake loading cycle. In order to better understand the structure of these systems at depth, we investigate the North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ) as part of a multidisciplinary project entitled FaultLab. This fault system extends ~1200km across Turkey and has shown a clear west-east progression in seismicity over the last century, culminating in 2 catastrophic earthquakes located close to the population centers of Izmit and Duzce in 1999. In this contribution, we will present new data from a dense seismic array (Dense Array for North Anatolia, DANA, a 6x11 grid with a nominal station spacing of 7km) located across a part of the ruptured segment of the Izmit earthquake. Using the techniques of teleseismic scattering tomography and scattering migration, the excellent resolution afforded by DANA highlights sharp (< 5km) lateral variations in structure at mid- to lower-crustal depths (~20-25\\,km) across two branches of the NAFZ. This suggests that deformation zones between distinct crustal blocks remain narrow at these depths. Integrating complementary results from other parts of the FaultLab project (satellite geodesy, geodynamical modelling, structural geology), the results appear to be consistent with postseismic deformation being accommodated through afterslip on the deep extension of a narrow fault zone as opposed to a broad ductile region beneath the seismogenic extent of the fault.",

Stage 5e, extending from ~134 to 116 ka BP, was overall an arid period in the Levant region, as reflected by deposition of thick sequences of halite along with FDM of flood origin in the Dead Sea. While the early (~134-129 ka BP) and late (~122-116 ka BP) intervals of MIS5e were dominated by halite deposition, a long sequence of FDM with no halite was deposited during the MIS5e peak at ~128-122 ka BP, indicating wetness in the watershed coeval with sapropel S5 in the Mediterranean, the result of enhanced Nile discharge, in turn reflecting enhanced African monsoon rains at the River Nile headwaters. Towards the end of S5 (~124-122 ka BP) primary aragonite precipitated in the Dead Sea within the FDM sequences, indicating bicarbonate supply to the lake. The Nd-Sr isotope ratios in the MIS5e FDM reflect changes in flood sources in the watershed. The floods are dictated by rain patterns, which depend on the prevailing synoptic conditions (e.g. Mediterranean versus southern sources). Overall the Nd-Sr signal of the MIS5 FDM lie between the fields of Saharan Shield, Arabian-Nubian Shield (ANS), and Nile sediment sources. The data show clear shifts between the pre-S5 interval and early S5, which shows the strongest ANS component, then the late S5 interval, which shows the strongest Saharan component. Early S5 is dominated by FDM from loess-like sources, in the northern Negev desert while the late S5 sediments reflect bicarbonate and FDM from Sahara dust settled on the Judean Mountains. These shifts indicate early S5 flooding from mainly southern sources during the peak of the precession-driven S5 monsoon interval, and resumption of Mediterranean-derived rains in the Dead Sea watershed as the monsoon weakened.",

TIR measurements on the other hand can be used to disentangle the concentrations of trace gases like CH4 in the middle and lower troposphere, but its sensitivity to the planetary boundary layer is reduced by the thermal contrast between the surface and the first atmospheric layer.

            "abstract": "Widespread and high rate of intermediate earthquakes in the Japan subduction zone open the door to systematically investigating the depth-varying characteristics of earthquake sources. Compared to the magathrust events rupturing on the interface between overriding plate and subducting slab, the depth-varying characteristics of intermediate earthquakes are still poorly understood. The major difﬁculty in this issue is that the source characteristic is always concealed from the effects along the raypaths. Here, we utilize the cluster-event method to ensure a robust inversion for source and path parameters for 813 events spreading over a depth range of 0 – 150 km and seismic moments 4 orders of magnitude different. Static and dynamic source parameters are measured and compared for three depth regions: I, 0-25 km; II, 25-50 km; and III, > 50 km, where distinct rupture mechanisms may dominate. Our resulting corner frequency, stress drop, and radiated energy provide strong evidence of depth-dependent characterizations of earthquake sources. The estimations of higher corner frequency and stress drop at greater depth with sufficient short-period energy radiation indicate a relatively concentrated earthquake nucleation. The thermal shear instability, dehydration related process or mixed of them may be responsible for these rupture characterizations of earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "In southwestern Japan, deep low-frequency tremor occurs along the subduction zone of Philippine Sea plate. Sources of the tremor show a belt-like distribution of about 30-40 km in depth [Obara, 2002], where the transition from unstable to stable slip occurs at the plate interface. The ratio of radiated energy and seismic moment is called the scaled energy, and it has been often used for comparing the dynamic characteristics of small and large earthquakes. The scaled energy of slow earthquake is in the order of 10-11-10-9 [e.g. Ide et al., 2008; Maeda and Obara, 2009]. This value is about 5 orders smaller than regular earthquakes, indicating that the source process of slow earthquakes is different from that of regular earthquakes. We investigate here the scaled energy of tremor in southwestern Japan to understand the source process of the tremor.\nWe analyze tremor recorded by NIED Hi-net, with Hybrid catalog [Maeda and Obara, 2009] and Hybrid Clustering catalog [Obara et al., 2010], from January 2001 to June 2011 in southwest Japan. We follow the procedure of Maeda and Obara [2009] to estimate the radiated energy of tremor.\nThe values of the scaled energy of tremor are in the range of 10-8-10-6 and are smaller than those of regular earthquakes by order of 2. Multiplying the scaled energy by the rigidity provides that the apparent stress drop of tremor is lower than that of regular earthquakes. This result indicates that tremor occurs in the condition of lower-stress and strain than regular earthquake. Furthermore, the obtained value is 2 orders larger than the scaled energy of very low-frequency earthquake [Maeda and Obara, 2009]. These comparisons imply that each slip phenomenon of slow earthquake family has different dynamic characteristics.\nWe recognize heterogeneous distribution of the scaled energy along the strike and the dip directions of the plate. Shallower events show larger value of the scaled energy. This indicates that the source process of the tremor reflects a spatial variation in frictional property at the transition zone on the plate interface.",

            "abstract": "Earthquakes are dynamic slip events that propagate along fault surfaces, radiating seismic waves. The majority of energy released is expended in heating and breaking of rocks along the fault. The fracture damage is linked to transient stress conditions at the rupture tip which only exist during dynamic slip, while the frictional heating depends on high velocity slip behind the rupture tip to generate heat energy faster than it can be dissipated, causing transient local temperature rise. One might think that extensive damage and alteration would result, creating an unambiguous geological fingerprint, but in fact, there are few unequivocal indicators for past seismic slip. In 1999, the rare fault rock pseudotachylyte (melt formed when frictional heating exceeds the solidus) was the only accepted evidence (Cowan, 1999). Recently, more indicators of fossilized earthquakes have been proposed.\nWe define “evidence of past earthquakes” as evidence of either fast fault slip (at rates that only occur during earthquakes) or evidence of the propagation of dynamic rupture. We first summarize advances made in identifying evidence in the rock record of fast slip. Much of the work during the past 15 years has focused on integrating carefully controlled laboratory friction experiments, and constraints from numerical modeling, with field observations in an attempt to re-create structures observed in fault rocks and then relate these to the specific boundary conditions required to form them in the laboratory. This approach has yielded a number of advances in identifying textures and geochemical signatures diagnostic of fast slip via temperature rises which may not reach the bulk melting temperature of the fault rocks. Next, we focus on damage near the tip of shear ruptures propagating at velocities characteristic of earthquakes, an approach which has received less attention in the geological literature than fast slip but is equally diagnostic. Finally, we try to frame some of the remaining challenges in this field. These challenges include future work on diagnostic features of earthquake deformation along faults, but also a more philosophical discussion of what an earthquake actually is.",

            "abstract": "This paper shows the results of a implementation of the data assimilation system to obtain the initial condition to the atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) for the Florida State University/USA. The better quality of forecasts is given the more accurate the estimate of the initial conditions. The process of combining observations and short-range forecast to obtain an analysis is called data assimilation. The data assimilation system called “Local ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF) is implemented. A prediction estimates ensemble in state space represents the model errors in that scheme. The LETKF is tested with the AGCM Florida State University Global Spectral Model (FSUGSM). The model is a multilevel (27 vertical levels) spectral primitive equation model with a vertical σ-coordinate. All variables are expanded horizontally in a truncated series of spherical harmonic functions (at resolution T63) and a transform technique is applied to calculate the physical processes in real space. The LETKF data assimilation experiments are based in two types of the synthetic observations data (surface pressure, absolute temperature, zonal component wind, meridional component wind and humidity) to evaluate the LETKF system for FSUGSM. The data assimilation experiments are based on observational systems simulation experiments where the “nature“ is assumed to be known, and adding random noise to the nature run. The first experiment, the “nature” fields are the FSUGSM forecasts without data assimilation, afterwards, we use the “National Centers for Environment Prediction” reanalysis to obtain the “nature” fields. The observations are localized at every other grid point of the model. The forecast ensemble size is 20 members. The numerical experiments have a one-month assimilation cycle, for the period 01/01/2001 to 31/01/2001 at (00, 06, 12 and 18 GMT) for each day. We compare the behavior of the model by comparing with its forecast, observations and nature fields. A source of information for the quality of any data assimilation is the observation-minus-forecast (OmF) and the observation-minus-analysis (OmA) statistics. The histogram of OmF and OmA for a range of spatial and temporal scales is calculated. The results showing the analysis from the assimilation of the two observations experiments will be presented.",

Potential applications are geological sequestration of CO2 and acid-gas injection during enhanced oil recovery. Pore-size distribution determines the form of capillary pressure-saturation as well as relative permeability-saturation curves. Van Genuchten parameters may be used to describe these relations to fit the observed data.\nThis study presents a pore-scale model to relate change in two-phase flow proprieties due to changes in pore size distribution due to the dissolution reactions. The pore space is represented using a multi-directional pore-network model which is composed of a large number of interconnected pore elements. Averaging over the pore network domain, upscaled parameters such as saturation is obtained. We will show how regime of flow and reaction (characterized using Damköhler number and Péclet-Damköhler number) may result in different responses such as uniform dissolution, shaper front dissolution as well as formation of channels or wormholes. Each of these reaction regimes affects pore-size distribution differently controlling van Genuchten parameters of two-phase flow.",

As this area also lays close to the left lateral strike slip Chaman fault, which is supposed to be marking the boundary between Indian and Eurasian plate, thus the resulting seismological behavior of this regime becomes much more complex. In the region of Quetta Syntaxis, below the fold and thrust belt of Suleiman and Kirthar ranges and on 28 October 2008, there stroke an earthquake of magnitude 6.4 (Mw) which was followed by a doublet on the very next day. In association with these major events, there have been four more shocks, one foreshock and three aftershocks that have moment magnitude greater than 5. On the basis of seismological, GPS and ENVISAT/ASAR InSAR data many researchers tried to explain the source of this sequence. The latest source modeling results, on the basis of ENVISAT/ASAR data has provided an insight about the complexity of tectonics in the study area. However, in comparison to ALOS/PALSAR InSAR data, ENVISAT/ASAR has lacked signals near the epicentral area because of the low coherence. Probably, it has led to different interpretations by different researchers even on the basis of same satellite data. By using ALOS/PALSAR data, we have suggested a four faults model, two left laterals and two right laterals, which also retains the most desirable features of previous models. ",

            "abstract": "Probability distributions or probability density functions are commonly used in geosciences for purposes ranging from characterization, estimation, prediction and assessment. Each type of probability distribution is found suitable for describing certain types of phenomena and processes, for example, the normal distribution is used, ensured by the classical Central Limit Theorem, to characterizing physical quantities summed many independent processes such as measurement errors, gamma distribution is frequently used to model waiting times, Pareto distribution to extreme events, power-law distribution to frequency-size distribution of earthquakes and inverse gamma distribution for self-organized criticality description of landslides. Understanding the associations of these types of probability distributions is essential not only for determining usage of these distributions but also for interpretation of the results. In this paper we demonstrate that a simple non-linear first order differential equation can be used to describe the decay function of probability density around the mean values. Assume the decay rate of probability density function is negatively proportional to the density itself or a power of the density, with a functional coefficient dependent on the value of the random variable. Applying Taylor series expansion to the coefficient function, the differential equation can be approximated by multiple simple dynamic systems, each with explicit solutions. These functions can be utilized either as separate and combined solutions to generate various commonly used probability distributions including but not limited to Gaussian, power-law, gamma, inverse gamma, Pareto, Weibull, Rayleigh, and Maxwell–Boltzmann distributions. The association of these types of distributions provides insight into multiple types of probability distributions commonly used in characterization of extreme events in nonlinear processes in geosciences.",

            "abstract": "How the lithosphere and asthenosphere deforms during continental rifting leading to breakup and sea-floor spreading initiation is poorly understood. Observations at present-day and fossil analogue rifted margins show a complex OCT architecture which cannot be explained by a single simplistic lithosphere deformation modes. This OCT complexity includes hyper-extended continental crust and lithosphere, detachments faults, exhumed mantle, continental slivers and scattered embryonic oceanic crust. We use a coupled kinematic-dynamic model of lithosphere and asthenosphere deformation to determine the sequence of lithosphere deformation modes leading to continental breakup for Iberia-Newfoundland conjugate margin profiles. We quantitatively calibrate the models using observed present-day water loaded subsidence and crustal thickness, together with subsidence history and the age of melt generation. Flow fields, representing a sequence of lithosphere deformation modes, are generated by a 2D finite element viscous flow model (FE-Margin), and used to advect lithosphere and asthenosphere temperature and material. FE-Margin is kinematically driven by divergent deformation in the upper 15-20 km of the lithosphere inducing passive upwelling below. Buoyancy enhanced upwelling (Braun et al. 2000) is also kinematically included. Melt generation by decompressional melting is predicted using the methodology of Katz et al., 2003. The extension magnitudes used in the lithosphere deformation models are taken from Sutra et al (2013). The best fit calibrated models of lithosphere deformation evolution for the Iberia-Newfoundland conjugate margins require (i) an initial broad region of lithosphere deformation and passive upwelling, (ii) lateral migration of deformation, (iii) an increase in extension rate with time, (iv) focussing of deformation and (v) buoyancy induced upwelling. The preferred calibrated models predict faster extension rates and earlier continental crustal rupture and mantle exhumation for the Iberia Abyssal Plain - Flemish Pass conjugate margin profile than for the Galicia Bank – Flemish Cap profile. The predicted N-S differences in deformation mode evolution give insights into the 3D evolution of Iberia-Newfound margin breakup.",

            "abstract": "Fault systems within incipient rifts that cut basaltic rocks comprise an array of fine-scale structures, including networks of fractures and small displacement (<15 m) faults that accommodate regional extension. These zones of damaged rock have mechanical and physical properties distinct from the surrounding intact host rock. As the rift system evolves this early-formed damage can be reactivated, and influence the distribution and growth of new fractures. Constraining the role of this inter-fault deformation in rift zone development is therefore important to characterizing the regional distribution of extensional strains, and the evolving physical and fluid flow properties of the host rock. Here we use high resolution field and remote mapping of the Koa’e insipient rift fault system on the south flank of Kilauea Volcano on Hawaii’s Big Island, and the Krafla rift system, Iceland, to investigate the evolution of segmented rift fault systems in layered basalts, formed at low confining pressures. Extension in the Koa’e system is accommodated dominantly by interaction of zones of opening-mode fractures and areas of surface flexure rather than surface-breaching normal faults, which is attributed to gravitational collapse of Kilauea. Extension in the Krafla system is localised on segmented, large displacement (>20 m) normal faults, the development of which may have been controlled by dyke emplacement. Preliminary comparison between the Koa’e and Krafla systems suggests that strain rate and/or the effective stress path plays a primary role in controlling the geometry, characteristics, and distribution of major faults, and the scale and distribution of secondary (oblique) brittle structures within rift zones.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the future evolution of the Po delta is fundamental to planning and management of this heavily-populated low-lying delta areas. Through the Holocene it was shaped by the interacting effects of sediment supply, sea level and marine reworking. Unlike traditional models, tectonics and climate have also played important roles in the delta’s evolution. Superimposed upon the active, but relatively unknown, natural system, human alterations to natural processes have become increasingly important, both (1) indirectly by changing land use and water management within the catchment, and (2) directly within the delta itself due to groundwater withdrawal, flood mitigation efforts, infrastructure development, etc. This human influence has intensified in the near present times as coastal and catchment populations grow, urbanise and develop their economies.\nThe work presented in this paper aimed at investigating the temporal evolution of patterns and processes on the Po Delta (Italy), using remotely sensed datasets. An innovative integration of remote sensing and monitoring method (Permanent Scatter Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar - PSInSAR, Small BAeline Subset - SBAS and Empirical Orthogonal Function – EOF analysis of 20 years of Landsat) has been used to study the temporal evolution of subsidence and its correlation with natural and anthropogenic causes. Results show an increase of the subsidence rates obtained for the last decade: the amount of subsidence due only to natural causes is typically a few millimeters per year, while the man-induced subsidence reaches values of several millimeters per years. Marshlands reclamation, groundwater pumping for agricultural and industrial purposes and methane extraction from gas fields near the coastline are the principal anthropogenic causes. Hence the final study results would emphasise the multiple factors and stresses that are influencing the delta evolution. Such a framework also allows the full range of management responses to be considered. In addition to traditional engineering approaches in deltas, there are opportunities to work with nature. The deltaic system has the capacity to be highly resilient in the face of these multiple pressures with important ecological and social benefits.",

Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) has been proven as a reliable method to counter global warming and keep the 2ºC per year policy in check and is currently in the pilot stage in many developed nations. The three major requirements for CCUS are: manpower in diverse fields, implementation potential and capital. Keeping other social problems aside, India still has sufficient mankind in all spheres of research ranging from earth science, engineering, basic sciences, economy, policy making, regulation, public outreach etc. to successfully work on such challenges. India has leading academic institutions, research labs and universities in science and engineering. They also have a working power force in aspects like economy, policy making, regulation, public outreach etc. in various management institutes of repute. India, however, lacks in sufficient funding for advanced research and capacity building schemes to support projects of such scale. Deployment of facts and concepts on climate change need an approach of much greater scope than what is anticipated. The above workforces can put forth a clear picture about the various entities surrounding CCUS and provide sensible planning and implementation information through scientific research. CCUS is only possible when the direct anthropogenic emitters like fossil fuel plants modify their features to incorporate the methods associated with it. The rural population has to be educated in context to the safety of the storage sites. Above all, the Indian government must holistically divert funds for such programs and provide economic incentives to the industries for the industries. The bottom line is that India has been working in lots of aspects with not very clear cuts objectives. There are CO2 capture technologies like amine scrubbing and membrane separation that is available and immense storage potential is also seen in the Gondwana coal fields and basalt rocks of the Deccan plateau. For successful working of such ideas, the confidence of a big section of public comprising of academicians, researchers, industrialists, sustainable energy workers, politicians etc. is required apart from the key workforce.",

            "abstract": "Ethylene glycol (EG) is a commonly used organic additive in hydraulic fracturing fluids used for shale gas recovery. Under aerobic conditions, this compound readily biodegrades to acetate and CO2 or is oxidized through the glycerate pathway. In the absence of oxygen, organisms within genera Desulfovibrio, Acetobacterium, and others can transform EG to acetaldehyde, a flammable and suspected carcinogenic compound. Acetaldehyde can then be enzymatically degraded to ethanol or acetate and CO2. However, little is known on how EG degrades in the presence of other organic additives, particularly under anaerobic conditions representative of deep groundwater aquifers. To better understand the fate and attenuation of glycols within hydraulic fracturing fluids we are assessing their biodegradation potential and pathways in batch anaerobic microcosm treatments. Crushed Berea sandstone was inoculated with groundwater and incubated with either EG or a synthetic fracturing fluid (SFF) containing EG formulations. We tracked changes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), EG, and its transformation products over several months. Approximately 41% of bulk DOC in SFF is degraded within 21 days, with 58% DOC still remaining after 63 days. By comparison, this same SFF degrades by 70% within 25 days when inoculated with sediment-groundwater microbial communities, suggesting that bulk DOC degradation occurs at a slower rate and to a lesser extent with bedrock. Aerobic biodegradation of EG occurs rapidly (3-7 days); however anaerobic degradation of EG is much slower, requiring several weeks for substantial DOC loss to be observed. Ongoing experiments are tracking the degradation pathways of EG alone and in the presence of SFF, with preliminary data showing incomplete glycol transformation within the complex hydraulic fracturing fluid mixture. This research will help to elucidate rates, processes, and pathways for EG biodegradation and identify key microbial taxa involved in its degradation.",

            "abstract": "As part of the North American Cordillera the Rocky Mountains of Canada impact the deflection of weather systems and the jet stream and form a distinct barrier to Pacific moisture reaching the continental interior. The extent to which this climatic pattern extended into the past is at present uncertain, so improving our understanding of the elevation history of the Rockies is critical to determining the controls on climate change within the Northern Hemisphere.\nWe have undertaken a comprehensive apatite (U-Th-Sm)/He and fission track study of the southeastern Canadian Cordillera, i.e. the southern Canadian Rocky Mountains, in order to provide insight into the mid to late Cenozoic uplift and exhumation history of this region. Thermal history and exhumation models of widespread low elevation samples in combination with 6 vertical profiles covering elevations from 500 up to 3100 m a.s.l. show at least 1500 m of rapid exhumation west of the Rocky Mountain Trench (RMT) during the Oligocene (Figure 1). In contrast, the ranges east of the RMT low elevation samples provide Eocene ages throughout. The data show a very different history of recent uplift of the Canadian Rockies compared to what is currently known from published work, which mostly infer that the eastern Canadian Cordillera has not experienced significant uplift since the Eocene.\nWe propose that the most likely cause of this rock uplift was upwelling of asthenosphere around the eastward subducting Farallon Plate. This also led to the eruption of the nearby mainly Miocene Chilcotin Group flood basalts and could have caused underplating of the thin lithosphere west of the RMT, adding to the buoyancy of the plate and lifting the range. Because the Trench marks the edge of the normal thickness craton which was underthrust beneath the Rocky Mountains during the initial upper Cretaceous orogeny, the eastern Rockies have a normal lithosperic thickness. This would impede recent uplift and provides an explanation for the older ages found in the east. Furthermore the data appear to show that ages do not mimic present day topography, suggesting that current topographic relief, at least west of the Trench, is younger still and potentially caused by increased erosion during recent glacial episodes.",

            "abstract": "Information on the amplification characteristics of the near-surface formations in a regional sense is essential to adequately represent both seismic hazard maps and ground shaking maps. Due to the scarceness of shear-wave velocity data in most regions, several methods have been proposed in order to obtain first order representations of Vs30. These include the surface geology method and the topographic slope method. The latter method has become the standard way for incorporating site effects into regional studies worldwide given the convenience provided by the global Vs30 Internet server.\nIn the framework of project SCENE we developed a shear wave velocity database for Portugal. The database consists of 87 shear-wave velocity depth profiles from a variety of lithological and geological formations. We used an iterative three-step procedure to develop the Vs30 based site-condition map: 1) to define a preliminary set of geologically defined units based on the literature; 2) to calculate the distribution of Vs30 for each unit; and 3) to perform statistical tests in order to estimate the significance of the difference in the Vs30 distribution characteristics between the units. The units were merged according to the results of the statistical tests and the procedure was repeated. We started by classifying the sites into six generalized geological units. The final set consists of three units only: F1 (igneous, metamorphic and old sedimentary rocks); F2 (Neogene and Pleistocene formations); and F3 (Holocene deposits).\nWe used the database to evaluate the performance of Vs30 proxies. The use of proxies based either on geological units or on correlations with the topographic slope shows relatively unbiased total residual distributions of the logarithm of Vs30. However, the performance of the methods varies significantly with the generalized geological unit analyzed. Both methods are biased towards lower values of Vs30 for rock formations. The topographic-slope method is biased towards higher values of Vs30 for Holocene formations. Our results reinforce those published for SCR in Europe using a sparser database: Vs30 is poorly correlated with topographic slope. We conclude that in the absence of endogenous data the method based on analogue surface geology units should be preferred to that based on topographic slope.",

            "abstract": "The southern Alps fold-and-thrust belt (FTB) in northern Italy is a tectonically active area accommodating large part of the ~N-S Adria-Eurasia plate convergence, that in the southeastern Alps ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 mm/yr, as constrained by a geodetically defined rotation pole. Because of the high seismic hazard of northeastern Italy, the area is well monitored at a regional scale by seismic and GPS networks. However, more localized seismotectonic and kinematic features, at the scale of the fault segments, are not yet resolved, limiting our knowledge about the seismic potential of the different fault segments belonging to the southeastern Alps FTB. Here we present the results obtained from the analysis of data collected during local seismic and geodetic experiments conducted installing denser geophysical networks across the Montello-Bassano-Belluno system, a segment of the FTB that is presently characterized by a lower sismicity rate with respect to the surrounding domains. The Montello anticline, which is the southernmost tectonic features of the southeastern Alps FTB (located ~15 km south of the mountain front), is a nice example of growing anticline associated with a blind thrust fault. However, how the Adria-Alps convergence is partitioned across the FTB and the seismic potential of the Montello thrust (the area has been struck by a Mw~6.5 in 1695 but the causative fault is still largely debated) remained still unresolved. The new, denser, GPS data show that this area is undergoing among the highest geodetic deformation rates of the entire south Alpine chain, with a steep velocity gradient across the Montello anticline. The earthquakes recorded during the experiment, precisely relocated with double difference methods, and the new earthquake focal mechanisms well correlate with available information about sub-surface geological structures and highlight the seismotectonic activity of the Montello thrust fault. We model the GPS velocities using elastic dislocations embedded in a kinematic block model approach, which suggest that the Montello thrust fault is weakly coupled with respect to surrounding segments of the southernmost thrust system. Future works will include the integration of InSAR data and the densification/improvement of the geodetic infrastructure.",

            "abstract": "During the last years high-resolution numerical weather prediction simulations have been used to examine meteorological events with increased convective activity. Traditional verification methods do not provide the desired level of information to evaluate those high-resolution simulations. To assess those limitations new spatial verification methods have been proposed. In the present study an attempt is made to estimate the ability of the WRF model (WRF ‐ARW ver3.5.1) to reproduce selected days with high convective activity during the year 2010 using those feature-based verification methods. Three model domains, covering Europe, the Mediterranean Sea and northern Africa (d01), the wider area of Greece (d02) and central Greece - Thessaly region (d03) are used at horizontal grid-spacings of 15km, 5km and 1km respectively. By alternating microphysics (Ferrier, WSM6, Goddard), boundary layer (YSU, MYJ) and cumulus convection (Kain-­‐Fritsch, BMJ) schemes, a set of twelve model setups is obtained. The results of those simulations are evaluated against data obtained using a C-Band (5cm) radar located at the centre of the innermost domain. Spatial characteristics are well captured but with a variable time lag between simulation results and radar data.\nAcknowledgements: This research is co­financed by the European Union (European Regional Development Fund) and Greek national funds, through the action \"COOPERATION 2011: Partnerships of Production and Research Institutions in Focused Research and Technology Sectors\" (contract number 11SYN_8_1088 - DAPHNE) in the framework of the operational programme \"Competitiveness and Entrepreneurship\" and Regions in Transition (OPC II, NSRF 2007-­‐2013).",

            "abstract": "Reducing the water footprint (WF) of growing crops, the largest water user and a significant contributor to the WF of many consumer products, plays a significant role in integrated and sustainable water management. The water footprint for growing crop is accounted by relating the crop yield with the corresponding consumptive water use (CWU), which both can be adjusted by measures that affect the crop growth and root-zone soil water balance. This study explored the scope for reducing the water footprint of irrigated crops by experimenting set of field level technical and managerial measures: (i) irrigation technologies (Furrow, sprinkler, drip and sub-surface drip), (ii) irrigation strategies (full and a range of sustained and controlled deficit) and (iii) field management options (zero, organic and synthetic mulching). Ranges of cases were also considered: (a) Arid and semi-arid environment (b) Loam and Sandy-loam soil types and (c) for Potato, Wheat and Maize crops; under (c) wet, normal and dry years. AquaCrop, the water driven crop growth and soil water balance model, offered the opportunity to systematically experiment these measures on water consumption and yield. Further, the green and blue water footprints of growing crop corresponding to each measure were computed by separating the root zone fluxes of the AquaCrop output into the green and blue soil water stocks and their corresponding fluxes. Results showed that in arid environment reduction in irrigation supply, CWU and WF up to 300 mm, 80 mm and 75 m3/tonne respectively can be achieved for Maize by a combination of organic mulching and drip technology with controlled deficit irrigation strategies (10-20-30-40% deficit with reference to the full irrigation requirement). These reductions come with a yield drop of 0.54 tonne/ha. In the same environment under the absence of mulching practice, the sub-surface drip perform better in reducing CWU and WF of irrigated crops followed by drip and furrow irrigation technique. This rank though changes in non-moisture limiting condition (wet year) drip performing better in reducing the WF of growing crops than sub-surface drip. It was observed that with all range of irrigation techniques, strategies and field management practices there is more room in reducing the WF of growing crops in loam than sandy-loam soil.",

            "abstract": "Long term aerosol climatologies of ground based observations reveal that aerosol properties follow characteristic annual patterns. For example, northern European locations typically exhibit maxima of aerosol optical depth (AOD) in summer with a relatively high but little varying fine mode fraction. In dry subtropical locations the summer maximum is coinciding with a low fine mode fraction due to dust outbreaks. In subtropical or tropical savanna locations the dry season is marked with a significant increase of AOD and fine mode fraction due to biomass burning. Here we address the question of how these typical seasonal cycles are linked to the corresponding climate zones. Based on the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) dataset of 136 stations worldwide with more than 7 years of observations, we characterize the average annual cycle of AOD and fine mode fraction of each station by fitting a Fourier series with two harmonics which reduces the description of the aerosol cycles to a low dimensional parameter space. Several statistical methods are applied to investigate the relationship of these characteristic aerosol parameters and the corresponding climate of each station. Climate classification according to Köppen and Geiger is used as well as precipitation and temperature climatologies. The results help understand the origin of the aerosol seasonal cycles and may have implications for the response of aerosols to shifting climate zones.",

            "abstract": "The Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) is an instrument onboard the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover Curiosity, currently characterizing the radiation environment on the surface of Mars. The radiation entering the instrument from above consists mostly of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) modulated by the Martian atmosphere. From below, the instrument is exposed to secondary radiation produced by the interactions of the GCR with the soil. This secondary radiation gets further modulated going through the rover body before entering RAD.\nWe developed a method of determining the direction of the charged particles measured by RAD. This method also extends the energy range possible for measurements with RAD beyond the intruments design limit. Using a combination of GEANT4 and Planetocosmics simulations, we reconstructed the expected charged particle spectra and intensities for upward and downward directed radiation which can be compared with observations. With the developed method, we are able to, for the first time, measure the upward charged particle flux with RAD both during the cruise phase and the surface science phase. Comparing the results of the simulations with the instrument data sets enables us to evaluate the simulation tools used to predict the Martian radiation envronment.",

            "abstract": "We use coupled 3D simulations of fluid, heat, and transport based on a 3D structural model of a complex geological setting, the Northeast German Basin (NEGB). The geological structure of the NEGB is characterized by a relatively thick layer of Permian Zechstein salt, structured in differnet diapirs (up to 5000 m thick) and pillows locally reaching nearly the surface. Salt is thermally more conductive than other sediments, hydraulically impervious but highly solvable. Thus salt structures have first order influence on the temperature distribution, the deep flow regime and the salinity of groundawater bearing aquifers. In addition, the post-Permian sedimentary sequence is vertically subdivided into several aquifers and aquitards. The shallow Quaternary to late Tertiary freshwater aquifer is separated from the underlying Mesozoic saline aquifers by an embedded Tertiary clay enriched aquitard (Rupelian Aquitard). An important feature of this aquitard is that hydraulic connections between the upper and lower aquifers exist in areas where the Rupelian Aquitard is missing (hydrogeological windows). By means of 3D numerical simulations we explore the role of heat conduction, pressure, and density driven groundwater flow as well as fluid viscosity-related and salinity-dependent effects on the resulting flow and temperature fields. Our results suggest that the regional temperature distribution within the basin results from interactions between regional pressure forces and thermal diffusion locally enhanced by thermal conductivity contrasts between the different sedimentary rocks with the highly conductive salt. Buoyancy forces triggered by temperature‐dependent fluid density variations affect only locally the internal thermal configuration. Locations, geometry, and wavelengths of convective thermal anomalies are mainly controlled by the permeability field and thickness values of the respective geological layers. Numerical results from 3D thermo-haline numerical simulations suggest that hydrogeological windows act as preferential domains of hydraulic interconnectivity between the different aquifers at depth, and enable vigorous heat and mass transport which causes a mixing of warm and saline groundwater with cold and less saline groundwater within both aquifers.",

However, various sources of uncertainty in forecasting streamflow pose significant challenges to utilize streamflow forecasts in real time operations. In this study we systematically decompose various sources of errors in developing seasonal streamflow forecasts from multiple Land Surface Models (LSMs) forced with downscaled and disaggregated climate forecasts. The objectives of this study are: 1) Quantifying various sources of errors arising from each LSM, climate forecasts, and downscaling/disaggregation techniques employed in developing streamflow forecasts, and 2) Comparing the performance and the skill of different LSMs in streamflow forecasting over selected target basins in the study area.\nFirst, three-month ahead precipitation forecasts from ECHAM4.5 GCM for each season were statistically downscaled from 2.8° to 1/8° scale using Principal Component Regression (PCR) and then temporally disaggregated from monthly to daily time step using K-Nearest-Neighbor (K-NN) approach. For other climatic forcings excluding precipitation we obtained hourly climatology over almost 30 years (from 1979 to 2010) from NLDAS-2 dataset. Then LSMs such as NOAH3.2 and CLM2 were forced with precipitation forecasts and climatological forcings to develop retrospective seasonal streamflow forecast over the period of 20 years (1991-2010). Finally, the performance of different LSMs in forecasting streamflow under different schemes were analyzed to quantify sources of errors and to validate forecasted streamflow.",

            "abstract": "Subduction processes influence the crustal structure in their vicinity. The Mohorovičić discontinuity (Moho), separating the crust from the mantle, can be influenced both in its depth and strength. Normally it is stronger than any crustal discontinuity, but a change in subducted material can weaken the Moho.\nWe are investigating the change in crustal structure along the Lesser Antilles Arc using three component broadband stations on various islands along the arc. This arc is formed by the slow subduction (~2cm/yr) of the North and South American plates beneath the Caribbean plate. We are using receiver functions and H-κ stacking to constrain the depth (H) of the strongest discontinuity and the average crustal P-to-S wave velocity ratio (κ) to that depth. The ratio constrains the subsurface material. Results in this field of study can easily be ground-truthed with the composition of materials found in samples from the same area to find uniform patterns.\nOur results show significant depth variations of the discontinuity. Some of our results match the depth of an inter-crustal boundary (Conrad) found in a previous study (Boynton, 1979, GJRAS). This suggests a comparably weak Moho in these areas, a theory that is supported by models based on petrological results.\nWe compare our results to synthetic data from inversion models that determine the depth location of the Conrad and the Moho. For this purpose we use a combined method of different inversion approaches and include petrological constraints. Where we previously see agreement between the depth of the Conrad in Boynton’s study and the H-κ stacking, the models now confirm this result.",

            "abstract": "Glacier and permafrost retreat are prominent climate change indicators. However, the characteristics of climate and hydrology in mountain areas remain poorly understood relative to lowland areas. Specifically, not much is known about alpine groundwater, its recharge and water quality variations, as these remote reservoirs are rarely monitored. As global temperatures rise, glaciers and permafrost will continue to retreat forming new sediment deposits and changing infiltration conditions in high alpine terrain. Climate change impacts the hydro-chemical composition of alpine waters, accelerates weathering processes, and potentially triggers mobilization of pollutants. Accordingly, we monitored groundwater quantity and quality parameters of an alpine porous aquifer near the Tiefenbach glacier in the Gotthard Massif in Switzerland. The goal of this research was to assess quality and seasonal storage dynamics of groundwater above the timberline (2000 m).\nTo translate hydrological science into an ecosystem service context, we focused on four attributes:\nWater quantity: observations of groundwater level fluctuations combined with analysis of contributing water sources based on stable isotope analysis to give a quantitative understanding of origin and amount of water,\nWater quality: groundwater level, groundwater temperature and electrical conductivity were used as proxies for sampling of hydro-chemical parameters with automated water samplers during primary groundwater recharge periods (snowmelt and rainfall events),\nLocation: Alpine terrain above the timberline, especially recharge into/out of an alpine porous aquifer at a pro-glacial floodplain and\nDate of annual melt (albedo effect) and timing of flow (snow- and icemelt from May to September) and groundwater recharge during the growing season.\nThe study found that the summer groundwater temperatures depend on the date of annual melt and are more sensitive to climate forcing than lowland groundwater temperatures. Furthermore the groundwater level determines the groundwater composition as indicated by the electric conductivity. These two observations taken together help form a better understanding of the hydrochemistry of the system, and provide useful parameters for understanding the impact of climate change on alpine groundwater.",

            "abstract": "Non-marine ostracods represent a reliable tool to reconstruct past climate conditions. The investigation of environmental tolerances of modern ostracod species is therefore vital to estimate past climate conditions based on fossil assemblages. To determine the climate range of individual ostracod species their modern geographical distribution is combined with climate data sets. The overlap of modern ecological tolerances of ostracod species found in a fossil assemblage yield information about past air temperatures [1].\nIn our study we establish ecological tolerances of species from the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas and indicate which environmental parameter is most important for species distribution. Therefore the point biserial correlation coefficient is applied on the species distribution of 34 taxa from 364 locations based on the presence/absence of species. We use a 0.93 km gridded climate database that pairs climate parameters with modern collection sites. In total we investigated the influence of 20 different environmental parameters, such as annual temperature amplitude, July and January temperatures, precipitation, salinity and altitude. The yearly temperature range is the most important factor defining the distribution for Candona candida and Fabaeformiscandona gyirongensis. The distribution of Eucypris mareotica is also influenced by the yearly temperature range, but in addition is restricted by low salinities. Species showing no correlation to temperature variations in their distribution were also identified. The distribution of Limnocythere inopinata and Heterocypris salina is restricted by the amount of precipitation, especially during winter months, and low salinities. On the other hand, Candona neglectaseems to be unaffected by any of the studied parameters and probably only is limited by extremely high salinities. The calculated mutual climate ranges of the investigated ostracod species will be applied to ostracod assemblage data from a long sediment sequence of Lake Nam Co, southern Tibetan Plateau, to estimate past air temperatures and allow for the reconstruction of climate variability.\n",

MAMAP was installed for these flights aboard of the Center for Interdisciplinary Remotely-Piloted Aircraft Studies (CIRPAS) Twin Otter aircraft, together with a Picarro fast in-situ greenhouse gas (GHG) analyzer (operate by the Ames Research Center, ARC), a 5 hole turbulence probe as well as a atmospheric measurement package (operated by CIRPAS), measuring aerosols, temperature, dew-point and other atmospheric parameters. Data collected with the in-situ GHG analyzer will be used for validation of MAMAP remotely sensed data by acquiring vertical cross sections of the discovered plumes at a fixed downwind distance. Precise airborne wind information from the turbulence probe together with ground based wind data from the nearby airport will be used to estimate emission rates from the remote sensed and in-situ measured data. Remote sensed and in-situ data as well as initial flux estimates for the three flights will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Recent progress in experimental stratigraphy of river deltas has brought an implication that basin water depth seriously affects not only delta progradation, but also distributary channel behavior and alluvial aggradation of the delta plain. A series of experiments conducted with differential basement suggests that a prograding delta can retain its isotropic shoreline configuration even though there is significant variation in basin water depth in the transverse direction, and thus that local basin water depth affects local residence time and avulsion frequency of distributary channels. With deeper basin water, a delta progrades slowly, distributary channels migrate slowly and avulse less frequently, and the feeder alluvial system aggrades slowly. Another series of experiments, which were conducted to produce a 2D graded alluvial channel, reveals that a delta facing a very deep water basin does not prograde, its distributary channels do not migrate, and the feeder alluvial system does not aggrade at all (i.e. the state of grade). These experimental facts imply a synthetic understanding of delta progradation, distributary channel stability and alluvial aggradation, in terms of the control of basin water depth. This novel understanding can be expressed in part by a simple geometrical model. Dimensionless rates of (1) delta progradation, (2) channel migration and (3) alluvial aggradation are expressed with an identical numerical formula that can be specified only with dimensionless basin water depth and alluvial slope normalized with the delta’s foreset slope. Values of those dimensionless rates, ranging between 0 and 1, denote how close the feeder alluvial system is to grade: 0 for grade and 1 for perfect aggradation. The three dimensionless rates, or grade index, are also applicable to a river delta growing with sea level change, as far as it retains an isotropic shoreline configuration.",

            "abstract": "Recent advancements in laser spectrometry offer new opportunities to investigate net biosphere-atmosphere exchange of ammonia. During a three month field campaign from February to May 2014, we tested the performance of a quantum cascade laser within an eddy-covariance setup. The laser was operated at a semi-natural peatland site that is surrounded by highly fertilized agricultural land and intensive livestock production (~1 km distance). Ammonia concentrations were highly variable between 2 and almost 100 ppb with an average value of 15 ppb. Different concentration patterns could be identified. The variability was closely linked to the timing of management practices and the prevailing local climate, particularly wind direction, temperature and surface wetness with the latter indicating higher non-stomatal uptake under wet conditions leading to decreased concentrations. Average ammonia fluxes were around -15 ng N m-2 s-1 at the beginning of the campaign in February and shifted towards a neutral average exchange regime of -1 to 0 ng N m-2 s-1 in April and May. Intriguingly, during the time of decreasing ammonia uptake, concentrations were considerably rising, which clearly indicated N saturation in the predominant vegetation such as bog heather, purple moor-grass, and cotton grass. The cumulative net uptake for the period of investigation was ~300 g N ha-1. This stresses the importance of a thorough method inter-comparison, e.g. with denuder systems in combination with dry deposition modeling. As previous results from the latter methods showed an annual uptake of ~9 kg N ha-1 for the same site, the implementation of adequate ammonia compensation point parameterizations become crucial in surface-atmosphere exchange schemes for bog vegetation. Through their high temporal resolution, robustness and continuous measurement mode, quantum cascade lasers will help assessing the effects of atmospheric N loads to vulnerable N-limited ecosystems such as peatlands.",

            "abstract": "Nutrient availability limits primary production in large sectors of the world’s oceans. Iron is the major limiting nutrient in around one third of the oceanic euphotic zone, most significantly in the Southern Ocean proximal to Antarctica. In these areas the availability of bioavailable iron can influence the amount of primary production, and thus the strength of the biological pump and associated carbon drawdown from the atmosphere. Despite experiencing widespread iron limitation, the Polar oceans are among the most productive on Earth. Due to the extreme cold, remoteness and their perceived “stasis”, ice sheets have previously been though of as insignificant in global biogeochemical cycles. However, large marine algal blooms have been observed in iron-limited areas where glacial influence is large, and it is possible that these areas are stimulated by glacial bioavailable iron input. Here we discuss the importance of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets in the global iron cycle. Using field collected trace element data, bulk meltwater chemistry and mineralogical analysis, including photomicrographs, EELS and XANES, we present, for the first time, a conceptual model of the glacial iron cycle from source to export. Using this data we discuss the sources of iron in glacial meltwater, transportation and alteration through the glacial system, and subsequent export to downstream environments. Data collected in 2012 and 2013 from two different Greenlandic glacial catchments are shown, with the most detailed breakdown of iron speciation and concentrations in glacial areas yet reported. Furthermore, the first data from Greenlandic icebergs is presented, allowing meltwater-derived and iceberg-derived iron export to be compared, and the influence of both in marine productivity to be estimated. Using our conceptual model and flux estimates from our dataset, glacial iron delivery in both the northern and southern hemisphere is discussed. Finally, we compare our flux estimates to other major iron sources to the polar regions such as aeolian dust, and discuss potential implications of increased melting of the ice sheets on the global iron cycle in the future.",

We use in-situ plasma density data from CHAMP and DMSP satellites, along with data of GPS receiver onboard CHAMP-satellite and ground-based GPS-receivers to study occurrence and global distribution of ionospheric irregularities during the main phase of the storm. Using CHAMP GPS measurements, we created maps of GPS phase fluctuation activity and found two specific zones of the most intense irregularities – first is the region of the auroral oval at high latitudes of both hemispheres, the second one is the low-latitudes/equatorial region between Africa and South America. The interhemispheric asymmetry of the ionospheric irregularities intensity and occurrence in polar region is discussed. Analysis of the topside TEC, derived from CHAMP onboard GPS POD antenna, indicate the significant redistribution of the topside ionospheric plasma density in the equatorial, middle and high-latitude ionosphere during main and recovery phases of geomagnetic storm. Multi-instrumental data allow to analyze in detail the complex modification and dynamics of the upper atmosphere in different altitudinal, spatial and temporal scales.",

            "abstract": "Particularly in arid regions, a profound knowledge about infiltration rates eventually leading to groundwater recharge is the major parameter for any resources management. Unfortunately, in arid areas, the rate of infiltration is one of the most difficult values to derive with sufficient accuracy.\nIn 2010 a 3D monitoring site was developed within a sand-dune belt SW of Riyadh (KSA). At the site, one 45°-sloped and 6 vertical drillings were deepened down to max. 13 m below ground and each is equipped with (i) continuous TDR sensors: Taupe- (sloped drilling) and tube- (vertical drilling) sensors as well as (ii) discrete temperature sensors to allow continuous moisture and temperature monitoring within the upper 13 m. The combination of the chosen sensors and the application of direct push by using a Geoprobe 7730DT guaranteed two major advantages: minimal invasiveness and continuous measurements of the relative dielectric permittivity along the borehole walls. Topp equation (Topp et al. 1980) was used to convert the raw signals from sensor into volumetric water content. To calibrate TDR data, the actual soil-moisture contents in the upper 8 m of the dune were derived from drilling core samples.\nWithin the dune, the moisture fluctuates between 0‑10.3 vol.-% and quickly reacts on seasonal climatic impacts in the uppermost 2 m, while moisture below persists at around 1.5 vol.‑%.\nOnly precipitation events with exceeding 6 mm/d induce increasing moisture in the uppermost 1.5 m of minimum 1.5 vol.-%. That indicates a threshold for effective precipitation of 6 mm/d below of which no remarkable infiltration occurs.\nDuring the observation, we derived from the observed precipitation events and the depth of the resulting infiltration fronts, that the infiltration process is driven by the amount of a singular precipitation event. As a consequence, recharge estimations for the so-called sand seas based on annual or monthly precipitation data are not applicable for the region.",

            "abstract": "The San Gabriel Mountains (SGM) in Southern California, rate amongst the most rapidly uplifting and eroding mountains in the United States. Their steep slopes and sensitivity to wildfires, flash floods, landslides, and debris flows account for imminent hazards to nearby urban areas that might be accentuated by climatic and other environmental changes. Previous studies suggested that river terraces along the North Fork of the San Gabriel River, record temporal variations in sediment supply and river transport capacity that are representative for the SGM and related to climatic changes during the Quaternary.\nBased on field observations, digital topographic analysis, and dating of Quaternary deposits, we suggest that valley aggradation in the North Fork San Gabriel Canyon was spatially confined and a consequence of the sudden supply of unconsolidated material to upstream reaches by one of the largest known landslides in the SGM. New 10Be-derived surface exposure ages from the landslide deposits, previously assumed to be early to middle Pleistocene in age, indicate at least three Holocene events at ~8-9 ka, ~4-5 ka, and ~0.5-1 ka. The oldest landslide predates the valley aggradation period, which is constrained by existing 14C ages and new luminescence ages to ~7-8 ka. The spatial distribution, morphology, and sedimentology of the river terraces are consistent with deposition from far-travelling debris flows that originated within the landslide deposits. Valley aggradation in the North Fork San Gabriel Canyon therefore resulted from locally enhanced sediment supply that temporarily overwhelmed river capacity but the lack of similar deposits in other parts of the SGM argues against a regional climatic signal. So far, there exists no evidence that in the San Gabriel Mountains, climatic changes can cause sustained increases in hillslope sediment supply that lead to river aggradation and terrace formation.",

            "abstract": "Accurate and consistent mapping of drought is important in water resources planning and management as well as for monitoring the social and economic impacts of drought related stress. Here, we characterize the spatio-temporal patterns of drought at regional to global scales using a multi-model framework that is based on a unified database of atmospheric and hydrological forcing. To do this, the latest version of the GEWEX LandFlux dataset together with remote sensing products of vegetation phenology and soil moisture are used to estimate terrestrial evaporation via four evaporation models (SEBS, PT-JPL, PM-Mu and GLEAM) for the period 1979-2009. Widely used empirical drought indices (e.g. PDSI, PSI) as well as the recently developed ET-based diagnostic drought indicators (e.g. Evaporative Stress Index, Drought Severity Index), were estimated at daily to annual time scales to evaluate the consistency of the ET models in identifying drought signals, and to assess the relative skill of the various drought products to detect significant historical drought events.",

            "abstract": "The main use of persistent identifiers (PIDs) for data objects has so far been for formal publication and citation purposes with a focus on long-term availability and trust. This core use case has now evolved and broadened to include basic data management tasks as identifiers are increasingly seen as a possible anchor element in the deluge of data for purposes of large-scale automation of tasks. The European Data Infrastructure (EUDAT) for instance uses PIDs in their back-end services and distinctly so for entities where the identifier may be more persistent than a resource with limited lifetime. Despite breaking with the traditional metaphor, this offers new opportunities for data management and end-user tools, but also requires a clear demonstrated benefit of value-added services because en masse identifier assignment does not come at zero costs.\nThere are several obstacles to overcome when establishing identifiers at large scale. The administration of large numbers of identifiers can be cumbersome if they are treated in an isolated manner. Here, identifier collections can enable automated mass operations on groups of associated objects. Several use cases rely on base information that is rapidly available from the identifier systems without the need to retrieve objects, yet they will not work efficiently if the information is not consistently typed. Tools that span cyberinfrastructures and address scientific end-users unaware of the varying back-ends must overcome such obstacles. The Working Group on PID Information Types of the Research Data Alliance (RDA) has developed an interface specification and prototype to access and manipulate typed base information. Concrete prototypes for identifier collections exist as well. We will present some first data and provenance tracking tools that make extensive use of these recent developments and address different user needs that span from administrative tasks to individual end-user services with particular focus on data available from the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF). We will compare the tools along their respective use cases with existing approaches and discuss benefits and limitations.",

            "abstract": "Little has challenged our understanding of climate change more so than the abruptness with which large-scale shifts in temperature occurred during the last glacial period. Atmospheric temperature jumps occurring within decades over Greenland were closely matched by rapid changes in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures and major re-organisation of the deep ocean circulation. Although these climatic instabilities are well-documented in various proxy records, the causal mechanisms of such short-lived oscillations remain poorly understood, largely due to the dating uncertainties that prevent the integration of different archives. Synchronisation of palaeoclimate records on a common timescale is inherently problematic, and unravelling the lead/lag responses (hence cause and effect) between the Earth’s climate components is currently beyond our reach. TRACE - a 5 year project funded by the European Research Council - exploits the use of microscopic traces of tephra deposits to precisely correlate the Greenland ice-cores with North Atlantic marine records. Here we draw upon examples of how these time-lines can be used to constrain the lead/lag responses between the atmospheric and oceanic systems during the last glacial period. High-resolution proxy data from North Atlantic marine cores MD04-2829CQ from the Rosemary Bank and MD04 2820CQ from the Goban Spur are integrated with the Greenland ice-cores according to the position of common tephra isochrons. These direct tie-lines allow us to focus in detail on the relative timing of rapid warming transitions between Greenland and the North Atlantic ocean during the last glacial period.",

In this paper we use three-dimensional full-electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations to investigate the interaction of localized plasma clouds with transverse magnetic field profiles typical for a tangential discontinuity. We consider a non-diamagnetic small Larmor radius plasma cloud streaming across a background non-uniform magnetic field that increases over few ion Larmor radii. Space and time variations of the plasma parameters and electromagnetic field are analyzed and discussed for different “strengths” of the transverse magnetic barrier. The numerical simulations reveal the formation of a polarization electric field that sustains the forward convection of the cloud across the discontinuity and illustrate the adiabatic breaking of the cloud as it is streaming into the right hand side of the discontinuity where the field is larger. The results obtained are compared with the theoretical model describing the impulsive penetration mechanism. When the initial bulk velocity of the plasma cloud is too small, the forward motion is stopped and an additional polarization electric field is created in the vicinity of the transition region that deflects the cloud along the discontinuity surface.",

            "abstract": "West Africa economies rely on rain-fed agriculture and are extremely vulnerable to changes in precipitation. Results from the most recent generation of regional climate models suggest increases in rainy season rainfall variability (delayed rainy season onset, increased probability of dry spells, shorter rainy season duration) despite a moderate increase in rainy season total precipitation. These changes could potentially have detrimental effects on crop yield and food security. Additional pressures on water resources come from increased demand as a result of high population growth rates (~3% per year). Increased water storage and irrigation can help improve crop yields but future assessments of water resources are needed to prioritize irrigation development as an adaptation option. Increased water abstraction, in turn can impact water availability in downstream regions so that an integrated assessment of future water availability and demand is needed. We use a set of 15 RCM outputs from the CORDEX data archive to drive WBMplus, a hydrological model and simulate water availability under climate change. Based on estimated water constraints, we develop scenarios to expand irrigated areas (from the current 1% of all croplands) and calculate the effects on water scarcity, taking into account increased demand for domestic consumption and livestock water demand, at a spatial resolution of 10 km. Results around the 2050's indicate large potential to develop irrigated areas on ground and surface water and increase local water storage without increasing water scarcity downstream for many river basins in the region that could help alleviate pressures on the cropping systems and thereby increase food security.",

            "abstract": "Subantarctic surface and intermediate waters flow equatorwards along the Chilean continental margin within the Peru-Chile Current system while Subtropical Surface and Equatorial Subsurface Waters flow poleward. Pacific Deep water also flows poleward here. Thus, there is an interplay of high versus low latitude sourced waters throughout the water column. The degree of north/southward advection of upper column subantarctic/subtropical waters varies on glacial-interglacial time scales, global cooling favours northwards advection of subantarctic waters, global warming can promote southwards advection of subtropical waters.\nWe investigate the nature of this interaction for the past 970 kyr using a splice of gravity core GeoB3375-1 and MeBo Site GeoB15016 from off northern Chile (27.5°S, 70°W). We measured stable isotopes and Mg/Ca in Globigerina bulloides (surface dweller) and Globorotalia inflata (sub-surface dweller). The number of foraminifera available for Mg/Ca analyses varied significantly and we used the annotated number of individuals per sample to generate pseudo-abundance records of both species. During interglacial periods, they are both scarce indicating conditions non-favorable for their proliferation, potentially due to stronger advection of nutrient-poor subtropical waters. Exceptions are Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 23 and 25 during the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, which show, similarly to glacial periods, high abundances. Because of the scarcity in foraminifera, our Mg/Ca-derived surface and subsurface temperature (SST, subSST) records are discontinuous and represent mostly glacial periods (see Caniupán´s et al. contribution for alkenone-based interglacial SST estimations). Through the past 970 kyr, glacial Mg/Ca-derived SST and subSST (upper thermocline) became progressively colder towards present. This is in line with equatorial Pacific records pointing to a low latitude Pacific-wide signal. The difference between surface and subsurface temperatures does not show a clearly defined pattern. The largest difference occurs from MIS 4 to 1 (6-8°C) suggesting strong water column stratification, while during glacial MIS 8, 10, and 16 both records are nearly similar, which we interpret as well mixed conditions in the upper water column.",

            "abstract": "Water is one of the most vital natural resource and its availability and quality determine ecosystem productivity, both for agricultural and natural systems. Una district is one of the major potential agricultural districts in Himachal Pradesh, India. More than 70% of the population of this district is engaged in agriculture and allied sectors and major crops grown are maize, wheat, rice, sugarcane, pulses and vegetables. The region faces drought every year and about 90 per cent of the area is water stressed. This has resulted in crop loss and shortage of food and fodder. The sources of drinking water, small ponds and bowlies dry-up during summer season resulting in scarcity of drinking water. Una district receives rainfall during monsoons from June to September and also during non-monsoon period (winter). The annual average rainfall in the area is about 1040 mm with 55 average rainy days. But due to heavy surface run-off the farmers not able to cultivate the crops more than once in a year. Past research indicate that the geomorphology of the Una district might be responsible for such droughts as it controls the surface as well as ground water resources. The research proposes to develop a water stress model for Una district using the geomorphic parameters, water resource and land use land cover data of the study area. Using Survey of India topographical maps (1:50000), the geomorphic parameters are extracted. The spatial layers of these parameters i.e. drainage density, slope, relative relief, ruggedness index, surface water body’s frequency are created in GIS. A time series of normalized remotely sensed data of the study area is used for land use land cover classification and analyses. Based on the results from the water stress model, the drought/water stress areas and water harvesting zones are identified and documented. The results of this research will help the general population in resolving the drinking water problem to a certain extent and also the cultivators to water the crops more than twice per year which might increase the crop yield in Una district.",

            "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the use of high-resolution Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) for evaluating biases of satellite rainfall estimates of flood-inducing storms in mountainous areas and associated improvements in flood modeling. Satellite-retrieved precipitation has been considered as a feasible data source for global-scale flood modeling, given that satellite has the spatial coverage advantage over in situ (rain gauges and radar) observations particularly over mountainous areas. However, orographically induced heavy precipitation events tend to be underestimated and spatially smoothed by satellite products, which error propagates non-linearly in flood simulations.\nWe apply a recently developed retrieval error and resolution effect correction method (Zhang et al. 2013*) on the NOAA Climate Prediction Center morphing technique (CMORPH) product based on NWP analysis (or forecasting in the case of real-time satellite products). The NWP rainfall is derived from the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) set up with high spatial resolution (1-2 km) and explicit treatment of precipitation microphysics.\nIn this study we will show results on NWP-adjusted CMORPH rain rates based on tropical cyclones and a convective precipitation event measured during NASA’s IPHEX experiment in the South Appalachian region. We will use hydrologic simulations over different basins in the region to evaluate propagation of bias correction in flood simulations. We show that the adjustment reduced the underestimation of high rain rates thus moderating the strong rainfall magnitude dependence of CMORPH rainfall bias, which results in significant improvement in flood peak simulations. Further study over Blue Nile Basin (western Ethiopia) will be investigated and included in the presentation.\n*Zhang, X. et al. 2013: Using NWP Simulations in Satellite Rainfall Estimation of Heavy Precipitation Events over Mountainous Areas.

The climate forcing fields are obtained from the EU FP7 project ice2sea, in which three regional climate models are used for dynamically downscaling two scenarios (A1B and E1) from two general circulation models (ECHAM5 and HadCM3). To assess the sensitivity of the projections to the model initial state, four initialisation methods are applied. In these experiments, the simulated contribution to sea level rise by the year 2100 ranges from an equivalent of 0.2 to 6.8 cm. The largest uncertainties arise from different formulations of the regional climate models (0.8--3.9 cm) and applied scenarios (0.65--1.9 cm), but an important source of uncertainty is the initialisation method (0.1-0.8 cm). These model simulations do not account for the recently observed acceleration of ice streams and consequent thinning rates, the changing ice discharge that may result from the spatial and temporal variability of ocean forcing, or the feedback occurring between ice sheet elevation changes and climate forcing. Thus the results should be considered the lower limit of Greenland ice sheet contributions to sea level rise, until such processes have been integrated into large-scale ice sheet models.",

            "abstract": "The World’s oceans generate persistent low frequency background signals or ‘microseisms’ through a mechanical coupling with the crust. This can occur through a direct interaction between ocean gravity waves and the crust resulting in microseisms at ocean wave frequencies, known as primary frequency microseisms (PFM). Microseism generation also occurs beneath standing waves generated by the interaction of opposing ocean wave fields, these have twice the frequency of the causative ocean waves and are known as double frequency microseisms (DFM). Microseism theory limits primary microseisms to shallow water regions but secondary microseisms can occur in deep water. For near coastal stations it is possible to establish a relationship between microseism amplitudes and ocean wave heights under the premise that microseisms recorded on near coastal stations are dominated by local sources. The continental shelf in the NE Atlantic is a known source area for ocean generated microseisms. To develop an understanding of the ocean generated microseism spectrum recorded in Ireland we use array analysis to locate primary and secondary microseism sources. The local microseism wave-field can consist of contributions from several regions within the continental shelf near Ireland and Briton. Comparison to ocean wave model data indicates PFM and DFM sources for a particular region tend to be adjacent and in regions with similar ocean wave characteristics. Typical seismic velocities are ~3km/s which is consistent with Rayleigh wave velocities for the region. However, occasionally higher velocities dominate and appear to be related to storms off the continental shelf. A possible explanation for this is the reflection of Rayleigh waves at the continental margin, whilst body waves prevail and monopolize the microseism wave-field for short periods.",

            "abstract": "Tropical cyclones (TCs) sometimes cause serious damages to human society and thus possible changes of TC properties in the future have been concerned. In fact, the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) by IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) mentions likely increasing in intensity and rain rate of TCs. In addition, future change of socioeconomic condition (e.g. population growth) might worsen TC impacts in the future. Thereby, in this study, we developed regression models to estimate economic damages by TCs (hereafter TC damage model), and employed those models to project TC economic damages under several future climate and socioeconomic scenarios.\nWe developed the TC damage models for each of 4 regions; western North Pacific, North American, North Indian, and Southern Hemisphere. The inputs for TC damage model are tropical cyclone central pressure, populations in the area exposed by tropical cyclone wind, and GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita. The TC damage models we firstly developed tended to overestimate very low damages and also underestimate very high damages. Thereby we modified structure of TC damage models to improve model performance, and then executed extensive validation of the model. The modified model presented better performance in estimating very low and high TC damages. After the modification and validation of the model, we determined the structure of TC damage models and projected TC economic damages. The result indicated increase in TC economic damage in global scale, while TC economic damage against world GDP would decrease in the future, which result is consistent with previous study.",

            "abstract": "Climate-induced heat waves have been increasing globally in the past 5-10 years and are projected to continue increasing throughout the 21st century. In urban areas, heat waves are exacerbated by the non-climate stressor of urban heat islands (UHIs). The vulnerability of a city’s population to heat waves reflects exposure to extreme heat events, sensitivity of the population to impacts, such as adverse health effects, and adaptive capacity to prepare for and respond to heat waves. Socially and economically vulnerable populations are especially at risk to the impacts of heat waves, due to increasing energy costs, air pollution, and heat-related illness and mortality. NASA earth science datasets, combined with socioeconomic data, can be used to create indicators that characterize vulnerability to urban heat events and address the effectiveness of adaptation measures designed to reduce local temperatures. The indicator development process should include engagement from local stakeholders and end users from the onset to ensure local relevance and, ultimately, indicator uptake and sustainability. This presentation will explore the process of working with urban stakeholders in Philadelphia to develop a set of policy-relevant, interdisciplinary vulnerability indicators focused on extreme heat events in urban areas. Ambient and land surface temperature, land cover classifications, NDVI, and US Census data are used to create a basket of indicators that reflect urban heat wave duration and intensity, UHI exposure, socioeconomic vulnerability, and adaptation effectiveness. These indicators can be assessed at the city level and also comparatively among different parts of a city to help quantify and track heat wave impacts on vulnerable populations and the effectiveness of adaptation measures.",

            "abstract": "The determination of isotopic anomalies in early solar system materials provides important constraints on the nucleosynthetic origin and isotopic fractionation of elements during nebular condensation and subsequent processing in the protoplanetary disk. Several recent studies involving high-precision Sr isotope measurements have pointed towards the possibility of small excesses in the minor p-process isotope 84Sr in chondritic meteorites. However, these data remain equivocal because of the reliance on internal normalization to a fixed value of 0.1194 for the 86Sr/88Sr in order to correct for instrumental mass fractionation. On the basis of such data alone, it is not possible to determine with certainty which isotopes have anomalous abundances. Here, we present new high-precision 84Sr-87Sr double spike data that return the true isotopic composition for all the Sr isotope ratios, free from any assumptions about normalization values. Our new data demonstrate that the Earth, the Moon, eucrites and diogenites plus several angrites lie on a single mass-dependent fractionation trend in three isotope space (δ88Sr vs δ84Sr). In contrast, bulk CI, CM and CV3 carbonaceous chondrites have highly variable δ88Sr but lie on a separate mass-dependent fractionation line of identical slope which is offset towards excess 84Sr by ca. 100 ppm. Several aliquots of the angrite Sahara 99555 yield high δ84Sr values, but with ‘normal’ δ88Sr similar to other angrites. Stable Sr variations in chondritic meteorites most probably reflect primary Sr isotope nucleosynthetic heterogeneity in the early solar system, whilst those for Sahara 99555 indicate later addition of distinct chondritic material. Our new Sr double-spike data clearly demonstrate fundamental differences between materials forming the asteroids and terrestrial planets versus chondritic materials (in particular CI meteorites) thought to be the closest representative of solar photosphere composition.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic activities are increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations at unprecedented rates. This carbon dioxide dissolves in the ocean causing both the pH and the concentration of carbonate ions to decrease. These chemical changes make it less energetically viable for calcareous organisms to form shells. This study focuses on a particularly important group of organisms; calcareous plankton, namely planktonic foraminifera and pteropods. These organisms lie at low trophic levels and therefore their demise could cause the total collapse of the marine food chain as we know it.\nThe Pleistocene is defined by glacial-interglacial cycles with lower atmospheric CO2 concentrations (180 ppm) during glacials and higher concentrations (280 ppm) during interglacials. These fluctuations provide an ancient experiment assessing the response of planktonic foraminifera and pteropods to changing ocean chemistry.\nMeasurements of planktonic foraminiferal tests over glacial-interglacial cycles (e.g. Broecker et al., 2003) show that shell weight increases as atmospheric CO2 decreases. We take this investigation one step further by observing individual plankton shells in a nano-CT (computed tomography) scanner which provides extraordinarily detailed three-dimensional images. These images enable us to determine detailed variations in test wall thickness and test volume, as well as ontogenetic changes in shell morphology as a response to changing atmospheric carbon dioxide. One of the key aspects of our investigation is that pteropods and planktonic foraminifera are studied collectively. This allows us to assess the differential impact of ocean acidification on aragonite and calcite.\nIn our presentation, we illustrate the CT technique and present preliminary results from a downhole investigation of the Pleistocene from Ocean Drilling Program Site 1002 in the Cariaco Basin. In the future the nano-CT scanning method can be used to evaluate the detailed morphological response of calcareous plankton to ocean acidification.",

            "abstract": "The present research deal with a basin-scale hydrological modeling approach for climate change impact assessment in the Shubuto River basin, Hokkaido, Japan by employing Water and Energy Budget - based Distributed Hydrological Model with improved snow physics (WEB-DHM-S) coupled with AOGCMs output. The WEB-DHM-S provided reliable estimation of seasonal and inter-annual variability of the snow cover area (SCA) and snow depth and the subsequent river discharge production. Comparison of simulated snow cover with the MODIS eight-day snow cover product showed that the distribution of snow over the basin was well captured. The observed and simulated discharge was found to be in well agreement. Sensitivity analysis showed that with the increase in temperature, the fraction of precipitation that occur as snow will decrease, resulting in less snowmelt driven runoff. To elucidate the potential impact of climate variability on the hydrology, WEB-DHM-S was fed with statistically downscaled climate data from the four selected AOGCMs for SRESA1B scenario. The 20 years daily discharge and snow water equivalent (SWE) of all the AOGCMs for the past (1981-2000) and future (2046-2065) have shown uniform direction of trends with decrease in snowmelt induced runoff. Based on the analysis, the mean annual basin wide SWE will decrease, on average 36%, relative to the past. Discharge projections indicated the seasonal march of snowmelt runoff in the future with predicted peak flow to be occurred earlier, on average 14 days, with reference to the past. The findings of present research reinforce the need of improved understanding and representation of changes occurring in the mountain hydrology.",

Although great strides have been made in developing early warning systems most deal with one hazard, only provide short-term warnings and do not reach the most vulnerable. This presentation will review research results of the United Nations Environment Programme’s CLIM-WARN project. The project seeks to identify how governments can better communicate risks by designing multi-hazard early warning systems that deliver actionable warnings across timescales. Household surveys and focus group discussions were conducted in 36 communities in Kenya, Ghana and Burkina Faso in order to identify relevant climate related hazards, current response strategies and early warning needs. Preliminary results show significant variability in both risks and needs within and between countries. For instance, floods are more frequent in rural western parts of Kenya. Droughts are frequent in the north while populations in urban areas face a range of hazards - floods, droughts, disease outbreaks - that sometimes occur simultaneously. The majority of the rural population, especially women, the disabled and the elderly, do not have access to modern media such as radio, television, or internet. While 55% of rural populace never watches television, 64% of urban respondents watch television on a daily basis. Communities have different concepts of how to design warning systems. It will be a challenge for national governments to create systems that accommodate such diversity yet provide standard quality of service to all. There is a need for flexible and forward-looking early warning systems that deliver broader information about risks. Information disseminated through the system could not only include details of hazards, but also long-term adaptation options, general education, and health information, thus increasingly both capabilities and response options.",

Six clusters of enriched δ18O and δ13C values in the reconstructed time series are identified as mega-drought events. Earlier archaeological evidences such as burnt charcoal, millets and grasses, suggesting dwelling site for prehistoric man, were reported from this cave.

Zao volcano is the first volcano that is demonstrated the reliability of the mass fraction corrected ages by Takaoka et al. (1989). They reported 30 ages for central Zao volcano, and However, not all units are covered and some data contradict the stratigraphy probably because of low-K and/or excess Ar contamination.\nBased on new geological and geochrolonogical study, the volcanic activity can be divided into six stages. Stage I: subaqueous eruptions of low-K tholleiitic basaltic to andesitic magmas occured in central part at around 1 Ma. Stage II: andesitic northwestern edifice was formed at ca. 0.5 Ma. Stage III: several small to meddle sized andesitic to deictic edifices were formed at western part during ca. 0.35-0.25 Ma. Stage IV: andesitic to dacitic lavas swelled out from central summit area and the main edifice was formed during ca. 0.25-0.20 Ma.

Taiwan Executive Yuan is conducting a six-year (2014~2019) program “Integrated River Basin Management Plan” applying LID to build sponge cities. Construction and Planning Agency, Ministry of the Interior is editing the manual of LID technology for Taiwan. However, since the hydrological environments, physiographic conditions, climates, the strength and frequency of disasters in Taiwan are different from that in America, this study takes the first laboratory experiment and model simulation to evaluate the efficiency of application of LID in Taiwan.\nLID Facilities includes porous pavement, rain garden, green roof, tree box filter facilities and so on, and in this study, porous pavement is taken as an example for discussion. In the part of laboratory experiments, the sand box experiments is designed to operate with the specified rainfall return period calculated by Horton formula and rainfall characteristics of Taipei. Then the outflow hydrograph in each designed rainfall of specified return period can be evaluated. As for model simulation, this study constructs LID simulation elements by SWMM model and tests the suitability for simulation of the outflow hydrograph obtained from experiments, and definitely quantifies the efficiency of water retention and flood reduction of porous pavement. The results fits well with the experimental observation data with less than 10% error of pick flow. It suggests that, with LID simulation elements constructed in this study, the efficiency of LID in actual on-site application can be evaluated.\nThe results shows that porous pavement is able to delay arrival time of pick about 5% ~10% and reduce the pick flow about 5%~20%, and hold the ability of near 3~5% water retention. It proves that application of LID can retain water and reduce flood in Taiwan.",

            "abstract": "Carbonate faults often contain small amounts of phyllosilicate in their slip zone. To assess the effect of phyllosilicate content on earthquake propagation in carbonate faults, we performed friction experiments at seismic slip rate (v = 1.3 m/s) on gouges of calcite, phyllosilicate (montmorillonite and illite-smectite) and mixed calcite/phyllosilicate compositions. Experiments were carried out at 9 MPa normal load and under both room-humidity (dry) and water-saturated (wet) conditions. All dry gouges, regardless of clay content, plus the wet calcite, produce a friction evolution curve, comprising an initial slip-hardening phase, during which friction evolves to peak values f = 0.60-0.76, followed by a dramatic slip-weakening phase, during which f decreases to a constant steady-state value of 0.19-0.33 over a distance which ranges from 0.2 m for clay-bearing gouges up to 0.6 m for pure calcite. Conversely, wet gouges with phyllosilicate content ≥ 10 wt.% show negligible slip-hardening, and the attainment of steady-state sliding almost immediately at the onset of slip, with f = 0.05-0.26.\nDry gouges show slip localization and grain size reduction within a narrow (<65 microns) principal slip zone, accompanied by microstructural evidence for thermal decomposition of calcite (although only when clay content is ≤ 50 wt.%). Wet gouges are characterized by distributed deformation and grain size reduction, with no microstructural evidence for thermal decomposition of calcite. We interpret that slip initiates within the wet gouges along interconnected networks of weak phyllosilicates, formed during axial loading compaction prior to shear. This can explain the: 1) measured lack of slip-hardening and peak friction; 2) observed distributed nature of deformation and grain size reduction; 3) lack of evidence for thermally activated processes, due to low frictional heating in accord with small values of friction and lack of slip localization.\nOur findings imply that small amounts of phyllosilicate in the slip zone of fluid-saturated carbonate faults can: 1) dramatically change their frictional behaviour, and facilitate rupture propagation to the surface; 2) significantly reduce the amount of frictional heating produced, and mask seismic activity by preventing the development of microscale seismic markers.",

This makes it difficult to represent the interactions and smooth transition among different cloud and convective regimes.\nHere we present an eddy-diffusivity mass-flux (EDMF) closure that represents all sub-grid scale turbulent, convective, and cloud processes in a unified parameterization scheme. The buoyant updrafts and precipitative downdrafts are parameterized with a prognostic multiple-plume mass-flux (MF) scheme. The prognostic term for the mass flux is kept so that the life cycles of convective plumes are better represented. The interaction between updrafts and downdrafts are parameterized with the buoyancy-sorting model. The turbulent mixing outside plumes is represented by eddy diffusion, in which eddy diffusivity (ED) is determined from a turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) calculated from a TKE balance that couples the environment with updrafts and downdrafts. Similarly, tracer variances are decomposed consistently between updrafts, downdrafts and the environment. The closure is internally coupled with a probabilistic cloud scheme and a simple precipitation scheme. We have also developed a relatively simple two-stream radiative scheme that includes the longwave (LW) and shortwave (SW) effects of clouds, and the LW effect of water vapor.\nWe have tested this closure in a single-column model for various regimes spanning stratocumulus, shallow cumulus, and deep convection. The model is also run towards statistical equilibrium with climatologically relevant large-scale forcings. These model tests are validated against large-eddy simulation (LES) with the same forcings. The comparison of results verifies the capacity of this closure to realistically represent different cloud and convective processes. Implementation of the closure in an idealized GCM allows us to study cloud feedbacks to climate change and to study the interactions between clouds, convections, and the large-scale circulation.",

            "abstract": "Terminations used to be regarded as effectively globally synchronous events. As such they were used (amongst other features) in aligning cores by Lisiecki and Raymo (2005) in their widely accepted global benthic stack. Skinner and Shackleton (2005) showed, however, that this assumption of synchronicity may not hold. In a detailed study of the last glacial-interglacial transition, an Atlantic record from the Iberian Margin and a record from the deep eastern equatorial Pacific – both dated by 14C for a solid, independent age estimate – show a significant discrepancy in timing: ~4,000 years. Indeed, in 2009 Lisiecki and Raymo published a separate reconstruction for the Atlantic and Pacific records in their stack, and found indications for diachronous termination signals for the last five terminations.\nWe compared the Atlantic and Pacific records of Skinner and Shackleton (2005) to the benthic isotope record of ODP site 968 in the eastern Mediterranean published by Ziegler et al. (2010), to see how the Mediterranean record feeds into this discussion. The age model for this record is constrained by the carbon dated boundaries of saproprel 1 as well as correlation to the radiometrically dated cave record of Sanbao-Hulu (Wang et al., 2008). The benthic δ18O record of ODP site 968 resembles the Pacific record much more than the geographically closer Iberian Margin record.\nThis raises questions: whether the Late Glacial/Early Holocene benthic record of MD99-2334K on the Iberian Margin is representative of Atlantic benthic δ18O; what oceanographic factors could have influenced the benthic δ18O of the sites involved; whether there is, after all, a globally synchronous, two-step deglaciation in the Mediterranean, Atlantic, and Pacific basins.\nLisiecki and Raymo, 2005.

            "abstract": "The mid-Pliocene warm period (3.264–3.025 Ma) is a key target for palaeoclimate modellers in the investigation of warm intervals in Earth history. This research is driven by the need to evaluate climate models against geological data in order to assess model performance in warmer than present climates. The mid-Pliocene has generally been modelled using fixed-boundary condition climate model experiments, such as those performed for the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project (PlioMIP). This means that orbital-timescale variability in climate is often overlooked. In the past data-model comparisons have primarily focussed on comparing snap-shot experiments (fixed boundary conditions) with time-averaged data (for example PRISM3 data which is representative of an average of ~250,000 years). In order to improve the validity of proxy-data and model comparisons it is critical that we move towards climate simulations that better capture changing bounding conditions occurring over orbital timescales and compare these with timeseries data.\nHere, we present two sets of transient simulations; the first is centred on the warm interglacial peak, MIS KM5c (+/-20 kyr) whilst the second runs from the glacial peak MIS M2 through to MIS KM5c (~100 kyr). We use the full-complexity intermediate-resolution FAMOUS climate model driven by PRISM3 boundary conditions (which were also used in PlioMIP phase 1). Our initial experiments apply a changing orbit, with and without dynamic vegetation. We present an overview of climate variability during these time windows, but also discuss the difficulties that have been faced in such modelling and detail some ideal future directions to explore",

            "abstract": "At the College of the Atlantic, Bar Harbor, Maine, undergraduate students have the opportunity to design their own curriculum within a major of “Human Ecology.\" To enable students to have early research experiences, we developed a field-based interdisciplinary program for students to learn and practice field methods in a variety of disciplines, Earth Science, Botany, Chemistry, and Wildlife Biology at three specific field sites within a single watershed on Mt. Desert Island. As the Northeast Creek watershed was the site of previous water quality studies, this program of courses enabled continued monitoring of portions of the watershed. The program includes 4 new courses: Critical Zone 1, Critical Zone 2, Wildlife Biology, and Botany. In Critical Zone 1 students are introduced to general topics in Earth Science and learn to use ArcGIS to make basic maps. In Critical Zone 2, Wildlife Biology, and Botany, students are in the field every week using classic field tools and methods. All three of these courses use the same three general field areas: two with working farms at the middle and lower portion of the watershed and one uninhabited forested property in the higher relief headwaters of the watershed. Students collect daily surface water chemistry data at five stream sites within the watershed, complete basic geologic bedrock and geomorphic mapping, conduct wildlife surveys, botanical surveys, and monitor weather patterns at each of the main sites. Beyond the class data collected and synthesized, students also complete group independent study projects at focused field sites, some of which have turned into much larger research projects. This program is an opportunity for students and faculty with varied interests and expertise to work together to study a specific field locality over multiple years. We see this model as enhancing a number of positive education components: field-based learning, teamwork, problem solving, interdisciplinary discussion, multiple faculty interaction, student mentoring, and original research. In the future we see the possibility of welcoming even more interdisciplinary work including rigorous studies spanning the arts and humanities.",

Although the influence of channel morphology on bed particle dispersion has been widely recognized in the literature for decades, there continues to be limited understanding of the mechanics of this process. In order to closely examine the influence of morphology on particle travel dispersion, long-term displacement data was collected from 1,400 tracer particles since 2004 in East Creek – a small channel with both riffle-pool and rapid morphologies. A set of flume experiments was devised to complement the field data in a controlled environment. Herein, particles were traced through a scale model of the field site using two tracing techniques in both plane bed, as well as riffle-pool bed morphologies and under varying flow conditions. Field data shows that channel morphology influences both particle travel distance and vertical mixing. Furthermore, detailed mapping of the channel bed displays a localized spatial pattern of particle mobility that reflects changes in both channel morphology and particle composition. The flume experiments allowed for the exploration of the conditions and timing under which a shift in the travel distance distribution occurs from a stochastic distribution (a Gamma distribution), to a distribution controlled by the local bed morphology.",

            "abstract": "The heat budget of a lake is a fundamental component of physical limnology, and is strongly dependent on the surface heat flux. However, the surface energy exchange depends on several factors, making it difficult to estimate. In this study we employed several bulk formulas to estimate Lake Geneva’s surface heat flux. Combination of different surface heat flux terms leads to a surface heat exchange model which requires various data. Different data sources were used in the heat flux estimates. Meteorological data were taken from an operational numerical weather prediction model, namely COSMO-2 (run by the Swiss meteorological service), while satellite imagery was used for the lake surface water temperature (LSWT). In order to find the best combination of the bulk formulas and to calibrate the model, the temporal evolution of the heat budget was estimated using long-term time series of vertical temperature profiles. Vertical temperature profiles at two points (one in the Lake Geneva’s large basin and one in its small basin) were used. A sensitivity analysis was performed to find the key parameters, and more significantly the optimal combination of different heat flux terms. Finally, the spatio-temporal surface heat flux variation was calculated according to the proposed model. In addition, the relationship between variability of the surface heat flux and meteorological forcing was assessed. The different models, which are of differing complexity, gave reasonably consistent results, with differences attributed to simplifications inherent in them. The modeling results revealed that the LSWT and wind forcing are dominant factors underlying Lake Geneva surface heat flux spatial variation, while its temporal variability is mainly due to the global radiation and air temperature changes. In conclusion, the bulk heat balance approach is a useful tool to estimate various heat flux terms as well as their monthly or seasonally contributions. But, in large lakes where the LSWT is highly variable, the variable surface heat flux would be unavoidable.",

This study attempts to improve the understanding of uncertainties in China’s energy statistics and evaluate its impacts to China’s emissions for the period 1990-2010. We use the MEIC (Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China) model to calculate emissions with different official energy statistics datasets. Emission trends were then verified by satellite observations using the approach of Lamsal et al. (2011) to include the non-linear relationship between changes in tropospheric NO2 columns and NOx emissions. We found that the apparent uncertainties in China’s energy statistics were expanded in recent years, and coal contributed more than 90% of these uncertainties. The emissions calculated from the provincial energy statistics are generally higher than that from the national energy statistics, and the discrepancies are 27.3%, 17.5%, 14.1%, 8.0% and 8.0% for SO2, NOx, CO2, VOC and PM2.5 in 2010, respectively. SO2 emissions are most sensitive to uncertainties in energy consumption due to high contributions from industrial coal combustions. The emission trends vary significantly among differ energy statistics, and a slower NOx growth rate (about 25%) from 2005 to 2010 are found both from the national energy statistics and from OMI satellite observations, whereas the provincial energy statistics show higher growth rate (40%), raising the doubts about the data reliability of provincial energy statistics in recent years.",

We have developed both an along-track dataset and 3-day gridded sea level anomaly (SLA) maps from September 1992 to April 2014.

The new reprocessed data has significant increased data coverage with between 4 and 10 times the amount of data in regions like the Beaufort Gyre region compared with AVISO and RADS datasets. This allows for a more accurate estimation of sea level changes from satellite altimetry in the Arctic Ocean.\nThe reprocessed dataset exhibit a mean sea level trend of 2.1±1.3 mm/year (without Glacial Isostatic Adjustment correction) covering the Arctic Ocean between 66°N and 82°N with significant higher trend in the Beaufort Gyre region showing an increase in sea level trend at the cm level up to 2011.",

The water resources in the area are managed, amongst other mechanisms, through water abstraction licences and discharge permits. Current management practice is not responsive or flexible enough to address future pressures. To support improving current water management in the area, a Water Footprint Assessment (WFA) study was conducted.\nThis is a pioneering work in the field of WFA applied in a regulatory context. The study deals with a high level of complexity in a number of aspects: 1) high spatial and temporal resolution (sub-catchment level and monthly time scale); 2) multiple water use sectors (industry, domestic and agriculture); 3) different sources of water for human use (surface and groundwater); 4) different types of human pressure on water resources (consumption and pollution); 5) integrated assessment of water use sustainability (water scarcity and water pollution level); and 6) projected water footprint (WF) with water demand and climate change scenarios.\nThe green, blue and grey WF on surface water, the blue and grey WF on groundwater of the 35 sub-catchments within the H&NL Area have been estimated for the domestic, industrial and agricultural sectors on a monthly basis. Blue water scarcity (BWS) and water pollution level (WPL) were evaluated to assess the sustainability of the blue and grey WF respectively, distinguishing between ground and surface water. A “wet” and “dry” climate change scenario for 2060 was used to project the WF components and BWS. This study identifies sub-catchments in the area facing moderate to severe BWS and/or WPLs and illustrates the relation between the two.\nThe results demonstrate that WFA and in particular BWS and WPLs can and should form a basis for regulatory reform for water resources management. Levels of BWS in sub-catchments can inform decisions on issuing and putting conditions on water abstraction licenses. Data on sub-catchment grey WF and WPLs can help review of the current effluent discharge consenting scheme. Abstraction licensing should be linked to effluent discharge consenting. The study proposes an approach to this regulatory reform based on the BWS and WPLs within the area.",

            "abstract": "Water quality parameters change frequently in time and space. Therefore, synoptic measurements of these changes are required in order to investigate potential water quality problems associated in lakes. However, obtaining in situ measurements of water quality parameters at sufficient temporal and spatial resolutions is a challenge. Considering the declining network of in situ measurements and availability of datasets across the globe, alternatives to conventional water quality measurements are necessary. Satellite remote sensing provides a mean to retrieve parameters related to lake optical properties for many lakes over large areas and with frequent temporal coverage. Chlorophyll-a (chla) concentration is the photosynthetic pigment available in all kinds of phytoplankton and can be addressed to monitor algal blooms and determine the eutrophication status. In this study, a linear mixed effect model (LME) is applied to MERIS satellite imagery to estimate the concentration of chla in Lake Erie, which is considered as Case II water (i.e. turbid and productive). The increasing phosphorus concentration in Lake Erie, especially in the western basin, stimulates occasional algal blooms. Hence, overall reduction in total phosphorus inputs to the lake is necessary. MERIS spectral bands are extended further in red and NIR wavelengths. These bands are required for band ratio algorithms to derive chla concentration over turbid lakes with complex optical properties, as the shorter wavelengths are affected by other optically active water constituents besides chla. The LME model considers the correlation in the repeated measurements of in situ data collected in space and time. This method is developed between the logarithmic scale of chla and the band ratio B7:665/B9:705. Cross validation resulted in RMSE of 0.30 for log10chla. The regionally tuned model was therefore reliable for application on a time series of images acquired over Lake Erie from 2004 to 2008. Results show that the offshore areas of the lake, especially the western basin, are experiencing high concentration of chla which intensifies in summer. The concentration of chla is the highest in western basin and decreases toward the central and eastern parts of the lake. The central basin of the lake experiences the highest concentration of chla in fall.",

            "abstract": "A shallow magnitude 6.6 strike-slip earthquake occurred offshore west of the Fukuoka prefecture, Northern Kyushu Island in Japan in 2005. We use InSAR stable point-target data and GPS to constrain the location and source parameters of the mainshock. We use a uniform slip model on a rectangular dislocation in a homogenous elastic half-space and implement Bayesian estimation to obtain uncertainties for the derived model parameters. The offshore location of the earthquake makes the fault parameter estimation challenging, as the geodetic data only cover the area to the east of the earthquake. The marginal distributions of the source parameters show that the location of the western end of the fault is poorly constrained by the data whereas the eastern end, located closer to the shore, is better resolved. We use Gaussian a priori constraint on the moment magnitude (Mw 6.6) and the location of the fault with respect to the aftershock distribution of the earthquake and find the amount of fault slip to be in the range from 1 m to 1.3m with decreasing probability. We propagate the fault model uncertainties and calculate the variability of Coulomb Failure stress changes for the Kego fault, located directly below Fukuoka city, showing that the mainshock increased stress on the fault and brought it closer to failure, a concern for the Fukuoka city authorities and inhabitants.",

In fact, water table is driven by dynamic forcing and changes with time. This study modifies the conceptual model of basin-scale groundwater flow by taking the fluctuating water-table into account. For both unit basin and complex basin, water table fluctuates throughout the basin cross-section except for at basin valleys. By the method of separation of variables, we derive the analytical solution of hydraulics head and stream function in the unit basin and the complex basin, and discuss the characteristics of the time-dependent flow cells. For the unit basin, the change in amplitude of hydraulic head fluctuation with depth is studied. For the complex basin, the time-dependent distribution of internal stagnation points is discussed. In addition, the relationship between flowing artesian zone and the fluctuating water-table is discussed. The results of the current study enhance our understanding on the transient nature of basin-scale groundwater flow.",

            "abstract": "During the last decades an increase of debris flow catastrophic events has been recorded along the Italian territory, mainly due to the increment of settlements and human activities in mountain areas. Considering the large extent of debris flow prone areas, non structural protection strategies should be preferably implemented because of economic constrains associated with structural mitigation measures. In such a framework hazard assessment methodologies play a key role representing useful tools for the development of emergency management policies.\nThe aim of the present study is to apply an integrated debris flow hazard assessment methodology, where rainfall probabilistic analysis and physically-based landslide triggering and propagation models are combined. In particular, the probabilistic rainfall analysis provides the forcing scenarios of different return periods, which are then used as input to a model based on combination of the USGS TRIGRS and the FLO-2D codes. The TRIGRS model (Baum et al., 2008; 2010), developed for analyzing shallow landslide triggering is based on an analytical solution of linearized forms of the Richards’ infiltration equation and an infinite-slope stability calculation to estimate the timing and locations of slope failures, while the FLO-2D (O'Brien 1986) is a two-dimensional finite difference model that simulates debris flow propagation following a mono-phase approach, based on empirical quadratic rheological relation developed by O'Brien and Julien (1985). Various aspects of the combination of the models are analyzed, giving a particular focus on the possible variations of triggered amounts compatible with a given return period.\nThe methodology is applied to the case study area of the Messina Province in Italy, which has been recently struck by severe events, as the one of the 1st October 2009 which hit the Giampilieri Village causing 37 fatalities. Results are analyzed to assess the potential hazard that may affect the densely urbanized areas and the transportation infrastructures which are present in this Province, demonstrating the usefulness of the modeling approach.",

            "abstract": "When the Galileo probe entered Jupiter’s equatorial atmosphere, it measured thermospheric exobase temperatures of ~900 K, 700 K higher than what was expected from solar EUV heating. Therefore, there is an ‘energy crisis’ at Jupiter, in which a large source of equatorial heating is unaccounted for. A prime candidate to explain the high temperatures is the transport of auroral energy equatorwards from high latitudes. However, the combination of strong Coriolis forces from the rapid planetary rotation rate, coupled with ion drag from magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, results in an ‘ion drag fridge’ effect (Smith et al., 2007), which acts to transport auroral energy poleward, rather than equatorward. We modify the UCL JASMIN model (Jovian Axisymmetric Simulator with Magnetosphere, Ionosphere, and Neutrals) to include the effects of auroral heating and H3+ cooling. Thus far, auroral heating and H3+ cooling were neglected in dynamical models of the coupled thermosphere-ionosphere-magnetosphere system, in order to focus on the effects of joule heating and ion drag on the jovian thermosphere. We explore how including these heating and cooling terms alters the energy and momentum balance, and subsequently meridional transport through Jupiter’s thermosphere.",

During the experiment, three atmosphere chemistry transport models - CCATT-BRAMS (Chemistry Coupled Aerosol-Tracer Transport model to the Brazilian developments on Regional Atmospheric Modeling System), a limited area model configuration of the Met Office Unified Model (MetUM) and MACC (Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate modeling system) - were used to support and guide the experimental design by providing operational meteorology and chemistry forecasts. A comprehensive overview of these forecasts has been carried out aiming to characterize the operational performance of the models at the time of the campaign. The present analysis focuses on the evaluation of the ability of the models to simulate the spatial, daily and intra-seasonal variability of the regional smoke plume. In order to do so, the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) forecasts are used as a reference. Unlike CCATT-BRAMS and MetUM, MACC was running in AOD assimilation mode. In general all three models were able to capture the major features of the regional plume intra-seasonal variability, i.e., the beginning, peak and end of the biomass burning season, shown by AOD time series from AERONET sites located inside tropical forest and cerrado ecosystem regions. However, in terms of the spatial variability of the AOD magnitude, there is considerable divergence among the models. As expected, MACC (that included data assimilation of AOD) presented better performance when compared with observations. CCATT-BRAMS tended to overestimate AOD mainly over tropical forest regions in the southwestern portion of the Amazon basin and MetUM overestimated AOD across the cerrado area and over the southern portion of the Amazon basin. Likely factors related to these observed biases will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "High latitude regions are experiencing accelerated atmospheric warming, and understanding the terrestrial response to this is of crucial importance as: a) there is a large store of carbon (C) in permafrost soils which may be released and feedback to climate change; and, b) ice sheet melt in this region is accelerating, and whilst this will cause albedo and heat flux changes, the role of this in atmospheric gas release is poorly known. To understand how sensitive arctic environments may respond to future warming, we need measurements that document current C flux rates and help to understand C cycling pathways.\nAlthough it has been widely hypothesised that arctic regions may become increasingly significant C sources, the contribution of aquatic C fluxes which integrate catchment-wide sources has been little studied. Using a floating chamber method we directly measured CO2 fluxes from spatially distributed freshwaters (ice sheet melt, permafrost melt, and lakes/ponds) in the Kangerlussuaq region of western Greenland during the early part of the summer 2014 melt season. Fluxes from freshwaters with permafrost sources were in the range -3.15 to +1.28 µmol CO2 m-2 s-1. Fluxes from a river draining the ice sheet and the Russell Glacier were between -2.19 and +4.31 µmol CO2 m-2 s-1. These ranges show the systems can be both sources (efflux) and sinks (influx) of CO2. Most freshwater data worldwide shows CO2 efflux and so recording aquatic systems being a CO2­ ­sink is unusual. Our data show spatial and temporal variations that are related to hydraulic as well as biogeochemical processes.\nAdditionally, where we recorded CO2 efflux we collected effluxed CO2 for radiocarbon analysis. The measured age of the released gas will help to identify the sources and dominant transport processes of CO­2 (e.g. entrained modern atmospheric CO2, or old CO2 trapped during ice formation released through ice melt, or CO2 derived from respiration of soil and sediment organic matter). These samples are currently being analysed and we intend to present this original data at AGU. By directly measuring aquatic CO2 efflux and age from this climatically sensitive arctic location and quantifying drawdown in high-pH ice melt streams, we have a unique dataset that aids understanding of key feedbacks affecting the impact of projected future climate change.",

            "abstract": "One of the major problems interpreting the evolution of magmatic continental margins is that the structure which should record the pre-magmatic evolution of the rift and which potentially influences the character of the rifting process is partially or completely obscured by thick basalt lava flows and sills. A limited number of deep reflection seismic profiles acquired with tuned seismic sources have penetrated the basalts and provide an image of the pre-magmatic structure, otherwise the principle data are lower resolution wide-angle/refraction profiles and potential field models which have greater uncertainties associated with them. In order to sidestep the imaging constraints we have examined the Ethiopian – Afar rift system to try to understand the rifting process. The Main Ethiopian rift contains an embryonic magmatic passive margin dominated by faulting at the margins of the rift and en-echelon magmatic zones at the centre. Further north toward Afar the rift becomes in-filled with extensive lava flows fed from fissure systems in the widening rift zone. This rift system provides, along its length, a series of ‘snapshots’ into the possible tectonic evolution of a magmatic continental margin. Deep seismic profiles crossing the NE Atlantic margins reveal ocean dipping reflector sequences (ODRS) overlying extended crust and lower crustal sill complexes of intruded igneous rock, which extend back beneath the continental margin. The ODRS frequently occur in fault bounded rift structures along the margins. We suggest, by analogy to the observations that can be made in the Ethiopia-Afar rift that these fault bounded basins largely form at the embryonic rift stage and are then partially or completely filled with lavas fed from fissures which are now observed as the ODRS. Also in the seismic profiles we identify volcanic constructs on the ODRS which we interpret as the equivalent of the present day fissure eruptions seen in Afar. The ocean ward dip on the ODRS is predominantly the result of post-eruption differential subsidence, as opposed to syn-eruption extension. The timing of intrusion of the lower crustal sill complexes remains unclear but they are most likely to have been emplaced as the supply of magma increased, which implies they are a late stage addition.",

Results from several recent historical LULCC modeling studies, however, reveal an order of magnitude spread in climate forcing from the snow-masking effect by forests. This is likely because, in months with snow cover, the interactions between vegetation and snow significantly complicate the relationship between the change in forest cover fraction and albedo, thus accurate characterizations of land surface-albedo dynamics are essential given the importance of albedo feedbacks when ground or canopy surfaces are covered in snow\nHere, we evaluate snow masking parameterization schemes of seven prominent climate models in greater detail in order to pinpoint major sources of the persistent variability in albedo predictions across models. Using a comprehensive dataset of forest structure, meteorology, and daily MODIS albedo observations spanning three winter-spring seasons in three regions of boreal Norway, we estimate radiative forcings connected to canopy snow masking and compare it to the observed forcings. We develop a physically-based regression model and compare its performance to existing modeling schemes, concluding with a discussion on the utility of purely empirical parameterizations relative to those rooted in radiative transfer theory and/or process-based modeling.",

            "abstract": "We performed a microscopic and chemical study of diagenetic reactions in deformation microstructures within deep mud sediments from the Nankai accretionary prism (SW Japan) collected during IODP Expedition 315. Our study reveals that deformation microstructures localize the crystallization of pyrite, a diagenetic reaction also found in large megasplay faults of the prism. Textural observation shows that pyrite crystallization is synchronous of the sediment deformation. The framboidal shape of pyrite crystals, the barium depletion and the strong arsenic enrichment observed in deformation microstructures compared with the sediment matrix, suggest that pyrite crystallization is mediated by the proliferation of anoxic archae. During scientific drilling expeditions IODP 315, 316 and 319, microbial life has been evidenced at depths of up to 800 m below the sea floor by the presence of biogenic methane and sulfate reducers in sediments.\nWe suggest that deformation structures localize microbial proliferation because the fracturing of silicate minerals produces hydrogen, a necessary compound for bacteria under anoxic conditions. Bacteria proliferate as long as active deformation supplies hydrogen, and vanish when the deformation stops. The development of bacteria in deformation structures impacts our mechanical understanding of fault zones in accretionary prisms: Firstly, bacterial activity converts carbon from organic matter and hydrogen into methane and/or water, which may alter the fluid budget of fault zones and the recurrence of dynamic ruptures in megathrusts. Secondly, the abundance of bacteria could be used to recognize active fault zones from inactive ones in drilling cores.",

            "abstract": "A new ice core from Roosevelt Island was drilled for the Roosevelt Island Climate Evolution (RICE) project to establish the history of deglaciation of the Ross Sea.\nEvidence of glacial retreat in the Ross Sea Embayment shows that deglaciation happened in several stages of rapid collapse and persisted well after the melting of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets was complete. The drill location on a small island surrounded by sea ice makes dating the core a challenge.\nWe present a timescale for Roosevelt Island using mixing ratios of methane in air preserved within the ice core measured continuously with a Picarro laser spectrometer as well as in high-resolution with gas chromatography (GC). Discrete data from GC analysis over the top 400m of core replicate both the magnitude and variations from other high-resolution ice core records from WAIS Divide, Law Dome, GISP2 and NEEM S1. Both the continuous and discrete methane records of the RICE core were matched to these established records and provide an accurate and consistent depth-age relationship for the past 3.6kyr.\nThe deeper part of the core was measured continuously in July 2014. First inspection of the data suggests that the oldest section of the core reaches into the previous interglacial (Eemian). We will present preliminary evaluated continuous methane data for the deeper part of the core together with a first time scale for the Roosevelt Island ice core.",

Our goals are: i) to understand the instrument and the environmental conditions that control the observed seismic noise; and ii) to obtain reliable broadband surface wave dispersion measurements.\nThe noise sources are investigated through the probability density functions (PDFs) of power spectral density (PSDs), which provides insights on the generation and propagating of seismic noise in the Gulf of Cadiz.\nWe show the results of the Rayleigh wave group velocity tomography performed using ambient seismic noise observed on the 24 broadband OBS and on 7 broadband land stations located in the south of Portugal.\nThe time-series, for the 11 months, were cross-correlated to obtain the empirical Green's functions between all vertical sensors pairs, namely the OBS-vertical, the OBS-hydrophone and the vertical component of the land seismic stations. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, the individual cross-correlograms were summed using a time-frequency domain phase weighted stack.\nThe stacked cross-correlograms enabled us to compute short-period surface-wave group-velocity measurements for all the interstation paths. We used these measurements to construct maps of Rayleigh-wave group-velocity lateral perturbations, at different periods.\nDespite the great difference in the crustal structure below the OBS (thin continental or oceanic type) and the land stations (typical continental crust, 30 km thick) we were able to derive high S/N cross-correlations between these different types of sensors.\nThis study was co-sponsored by several projects namely the QuakeLoc-PT (PTDC/GEO-FIQ/3522/2012), AQUAREL (PTDC/CTE-GIX/116819/2010), NEAREST FP6-2005-GLOBAL-4 (OJ 2005 C177/15), WILAS (PTDC/CTE-GIX/097946/2008), and PEST-OE/CTE/LA-0019/2013-2014.",

            "abstract": "For decades, it has been mentioned that submarine slope failures are spatially linked to the presence of gas hydrates/gas-charged sediments. When triggered by earthquakes, oversteepen and instable sediments may prompt breakouts of the slopes containing gas hydrates and cause submarine landslides and tsunamis. Widely distributed BSRs have been observed in the area offshore of southwestern Taiwan where the active accretionary complex meets with the passive China continental margin. In the region, large or small scale landslides were also reported based on seismic interpretations. In order to clarify the link between earthquake, landslide and the presence of gas hydrate, we evaluate the response of seafloor sediments in regard to passive dynamic loads. Horizontal-to-vertical (H/V) spectral ratios are used to characterize the local sediment response. Ambient noise as well as distant earthquakes are used as generators of the passive dynamic loads. Based on this study, we aim to characterize the site in terms of its physical properties and the local site effect produced by shallow marine sediments. The results show that the maximum H/V ratios appeared in the range of 5-10 Hz, where the horizontal amplitudes increased by an order of magnitude relative to the vertical amplitude. The stations located in the northwestern part of study area were characterized by another relatively small peak at proximately 2 Hz, which may indicates the presence of a discontinuity of sediments. For most stations, the H/V ratios estimated based on the earthquake (i.e. strong input signal) and noise (background, micro-seismic noise) records were characterized by different pattern. No distinct peak is observed for the H/V pattern calculated during earthquakes. This phenomenon may suggest that no clear sedimentary boundary exist when a stronger motion applies. Estimating H/V spectral ratios of data recorded by the seven short period OBSs (Ocean Bottom Seismometer) deployed in the southwest Taiwan offshore area in April 2014 offers a general understanding of the preferential vibration modes of soft sediment systems. By comparing the resonance characteristics of each sites and the gas hydrate distribution, we hope to provide precious information for the designing of marine structures such as oil drilling and production platforms.",

            "abstract": "Geothermal energy is of increasing importance as alternative, environmentally friendly technology for heat management. Direct interaction with the subsurface requires careful implementation, in particular in geological complex regions. The historical city Staufen im Breisgau, SW Germany, has attracted national attention as a case of implementation failure with severe consequences, causing debates on the applicability and security of this sustainable technique.\nLocated at the eastern transition zone of the Upper Rhine Graben and the Schwarzwald massif, the geothermal potential is high at Staufen due to strong temperature gradients. In September 2007, seven boreholes for geothermal probes were drilled up to a depth of 140 m to provide a new heat management for the city hall. Within five years an uplift phenomenon has been observed in Staufen reaching more than 40 cm in places and 269 buildings were damaged. Hydro-chemical driven anhydrite-gypsum transformation in the subsurface was identified as the cause leading to volume increase that is observable as surface uplift. This process is associated with the geothermal drilling activities that have crossed several groundwater levels.\nIn this work, we summarize and present the findings of spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) analysis of the uplift in Staufen over the last five years from July 2008 through July 2013. By applying the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) method, we find a localized elliptical-shaped deformation field in NE-SW orientation. Area of maximum uplift is located 50 m NNE of the drilling zone. At this location, we observe a cumulative uplift of approx. 13.7 cm ± 0.34 cm (mean value within an area of 30 m by 30 m) from July 2008 to July 2009, which reduced to cumulative uplift of 3 cm ± 0.25 cm from July 2012 to July 2013. The deceleration can be related to applied countermeasures as borehole sealing and groundwater pumping.\nThe observed ground surface response was compared to regularly performed leveling measurements and shows indications of significant symmetric horizontal motions, which were further investigated by a combined analysis of SAR imagery from ascending and descending orbits. Moreover, InSAR observations were inverted using geophysical models to derive first order characteristics of deformation source at depth.",

            "abstract": "A long-standing problem in the paleoclimate modeling community has been the inability of the models to reproduce the shallow meridional temperature gradient (∆T) observed in proxy temperature records for the warm, greenhouse time intervals in Earth’s history, such as the early Eocene. It is often stated that this mismatch indicates a missing high-latitude feedback mechanism in the climate models that would cause substantial polar amplification of warming. However, this issue is complicated by the potential biasing of proxy records due to issues related to temperature calibrations and/or diagenesis. In this study, we propose an alternative approach to estimate ∆T for these time intervals using hydrogen isotopic composition of leaf-wax biomarkers (dDleaf-wax) preserved in the sedimentary record.\nToday, dDleaf-wax is closely related to the hydrological cycle and source vegetation. In the mid- and high-latitudes, dDleaf-wax changes pertaining to the hydrological cycle can be interpreted using a Rayleigh distillation process, where evaporated moisture from the sub-tropics undergoes isotopic fractionation and becomes increasingly D-depleted during poleward transport. We develop a box model based on the Rayleigh distillation process that uses the global mean temperature for the time-period and geological archives of dDleaf-wax to estimate the meridional temperature gradient. We use this box model for the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; ~56Ma), a rapid-warming event in the early Eocene where global warming is accompanied by evidence for increased input of greenhouse gases. We compile existing leaf-wax dDleaf-wax records from the extra-tropics to estimate ∆T before and during the PETM. Preliminary results suggest that the temperature gradient increased during the body of the PETM, contradicting our expectations based on temperature proxies. We also use this approach to estimate ∆T during other intervals in earth’s history, such as the early Eocene. Further, we evaluate the model sensitivity to dDleaf-wax changes due to changes in the ecosystem during the PETM, i.e. changes in apparent fractionation through changes in vegetation type.",

            "abstract": "Tropical Cyclones (TCs) lead to potentially severe coastal flooding through wind surge and also through rainfall-runoff processes. There is growing interest in modeling these processes simultaneously. Here, a statistical approach that can facilitate this process is presented with an application to the Hudson River Basin that is associated with the New York City metropolitan area.\nThree submodels are used in sequence. The first submodel is a stochastic model of the complete life cycle of North Atlantic (NA) tropical cyclones developed by Hall and Yonekura (2011). It uses archived data of TCs throughout the North Atlantic to estimate landfall rates at high geographic resolution as a function of the ENSO state and of sea surface temperature (SST).\nThe second submodel translates the attributes of a tropical cyclone simulated by the first model to the streamflows at specific points of the tributaries of the Hudson River. That points are the closure sections of five different watersheds. Two different approaches are used and compared: 1) an ANN-cyclone/rainfall clustering model which calculates the rainfall intensity at selected stations within the watershed, that are then used as inputs of an ANN rainfall/runoff model; 2) an ANN/ Bayesian multivariate approach that translates the TC attributes ( track, SST, Velocities,..) directly in streamflows in the tributaries.\nFinally, the streamflows of the tributaries of the Hudson River are to be used as inputs in a hydrodynamic model that includes storm surge dynamics for the simulation of coastal flooding along the Hudson River. Calibration and validation of the model is carried out by using, selected tropical cyclone data since 1950, and hourly and daily station rainfall and streamflow recorded for such extreme events. Seven stream gauges (Croton River, Rondout Creek, Wappinger Creek, Troy dam, Mohawk River at Cohoes, Mohawk River diversion at Crescent Dam, Hudson River above lock one nr Waterford) and over 20 rain gauges are used. The performance of the proposed model as tool for storm events is then analyzed and discussed.",

            "abstract": "Little Ice Age (LIA) which lasted during approximately 1450 to 1850 (e.g. Grove, 1988) is known as naturally occurring climate fluctuation, so knowing LIA in detail is necessary to improve climate models. Instrumental records can only extend back to about 100 years in many areas, thus paleoclimate records are reconstructed using proxies in tree rings, sediments and so force. However there are differences in reconstructed timings and magnitudes of LIA occurred in each area (Overpack et al., 1997), and most of the records are based mainly on terrestrial proxies such as tree ring records, whereas only limited numbers of marine records are available (Mann et al., 2008).\nCoral skeletal climatology is a useful tool to reconstruct marine paleoclimate records in tropics and subtropics. Hermatypic corals, Porites spp. have aragonite skeletons and they have annual bands, which are suitable to reconstruct high-resolution paleoclimate in seasonal scale by measuring chemical compositions. Skeletal Sr/Ca ratio in Porites spp. has been widely used as a reliable proxy of SST (Sea Surface Temperature). However, corals grow for approximately several decades to 200 years, hence it is difficult to reconstruct LIA paleoclimate using living corals. Cobb et al. (2003) used fossil corals casted on shore by storms to reconstruct millennial scale paleoclimate. There are fossil coral boulders in the eastern coast of Ishigaki Island, Ryukyus, Japan. These fossil coral boulders were casted on shore by paleo Tsunami events, thus they are called “Tsunami boulders” (Araoka et al., 2010). Fossil corals used by Cobb et al. have 30-90-year records while some large Tsunami boulders have multi-centennial continuous records.\nIn this study, we reconstruct paleo SST using the Tsunami boulder from Ishigaki Island. The boulder has 185 years of annual banding. U-series dating shows the boulder was moved on shore at Meiwa earthquake in 1771. We measure Sr/Ca ratio using LA-HR-ICPMS (Laser Ablation High Resolution Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) to reconstruct paleo SST during LIA (Kawakubo et al., 2014). LA-HR-ICPMS enables us to measure the long coral core rapidly.\nOur result shows SST variation in 17th-18th century in this area and SST declined in around 1700. This result reveals the response of Little Ice Age in the northwestern Pacific.",

All TR-KYH stations generates real-time continuous data. A new dense strong-motion array (MATNet) has been installed near Hatay-K.Maras areas. It is at the SW corner of the East Anatolia Fault Zone (EAFZ). Primary target of MATNet is to investigate local site effects. Other important goal is to evaluate them as a part of early warning and preliminary damage estimate system. We also aim to develop a new attenuation relationship in the future from records including this new array. Most recorders are deployed as free-field and mounted in the container which is designed and produced for specific purposes.\nHatay, Iskenderun and K.Maras cities have residential, industrial and dense populated areas. New stations are installed on different geological units in 1-3 km or 5-15 km intervals in city centers. Distances increase up to 30 km at the outside of settlements. The MATNet contains 55 triaxial force-balance accelerometers and capable to record explosions. A recent earthquake (Mw=4.5) occurred in the Gulf of Iskenderun on 14 February 2014, and triggered the MATNet and other regional accelerographs (80 triaxial strong-motion stations in total). Location of MATNet strong-motion stations in Hatay-K.Maras Region, Turkey, and distribution of triggered accelerometers during the recent earthquake (Mw=4.5), have been shown in the figure as a- and b-. In the present study, we analyzed to estimate the site response in the frequency range 0.5-10.0 Hz using the reference site (SSR) and HVSR techniques. The site response values thus obtained at each strong-motion sites were observed to be associated with the Quaternary formations. The maximum site amplifications at 0.5-1.8 Hz are detected as 10 around Hatay city, 6-8 (for 0.8-2.3 Hz) near K.Maras and Iskenderun areas. It is apparent that in both 0.5-1.8 and 0.8-2.3 Hz frequency bands, presence of geological contacts and sediment thicknesses controls the site responses in the study areas. It is also inferred that larger site response (~10) value in the 0.5 Hz frequency band could be indicating the probable presence of soil class C (360<Vs≤760 m/s) or D (180<Vs≤360 m/s) in the Hatay basin according to NEHRP provisions.",

It is known that magnetic field lines on two sides of a tangential discontinuity can connect to each other only at a neutral point, where the strength of the magnetic field is equal to zero. Thus, the standard reconnection picture with magnetic field lines intersecting at the neutral point is not applicable to the component reconnection events observed at the magnetopause and in the solar corona. In our early study (Yu, Lyu, & Wu, 2011), we have shown that annihilation of magnetic field near a thin current sheet can lead to the formation of normal magnetic field component (normal to the current sheet) to break the frozen-in condition and to accelerate the reconnected plasma flux, even without the presence of a neutral point. In this study, we examine whether or not a generation, rather than annihilation, of magnetic field in a nun-uniform thin current sheet can also lead to reconnection of plasma flux. Our results indicate that a non-uniform enhancement of electric current can yield formation of field-aligned currents. The normal-component magnetic field generated by the field-aligned currents can yield reconnection of plasma flux just outside the current-enhancement region. The particle motion that can lead to non-uniform enhancement of electric currents will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The Atlantic deep ocean circulation in the Latest Cretaceous (75-66 Ma) was dominated by regional processes, as indicated by the presence of distinct deep water masses. Due to the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, its different sub-basins became progressively connected and a global mode of ocean circulation commenced in the early Paleogene, ~60 Ma. To understand the evolution of deep water formation and exchange, Nd-isotope data and δ13C stratigraphies are generated for a range of sites in the North and South Atlantic. These permit to identify different intermediate and deep-water masses, to recognize their potential source regions and to determine the exact timing of deep water connection.\nThe carbonate-rich pelagic sediments of Site U1403 near Newfoundland can be astronomically tuned and correlated to the global δ13C framework.\nRelatively negative seawater εNd(t) signatures in the 67-62 Ma interval at Site U1403 of ~-10 are distinct from those recorded further south in the North Atlantic. Possible explanations could include elevated non-radiogenic weathering inputs from the North American craton.\nIn the latest Maastrichtian, the Site U1403 εNd(t) record displays a short-term positive excursion before the K/Pg boundary (67-66 Ma) followed by a sudden drop to unradiogenic values at the boundary. Changes in ocean circulation might be related to climatic changes in the pre-extinction interval and the impact itself.\nThe εNd(t) records at Sites 1267 and 525 at Walvis Ridge show that an early Maastrichtian excursion to highly radiogenic values reflects a brief interval at 72-70 Ma, related to a period of increased hot-spot volcanism. Concomitant measurements of εNd(t) values in three different archives, fish teeth, ferromanganese coatings of bulk sediments and of foraminifera, provide a test for the partial influence of detrital particles on the isotopic composition of coatings.\nThe first data of Sites U1403, 1267 and 525 indicate the occurrence of a common deep-water neodymium isotope signature (εNd(t) -8) in the North and South Atlantic since 60 Ma. At this time, the sub-basins of the deep Atlantic became fully connected. A deep-water mass with a common εNd(t) signature, likely originating in the high southern latitudes, prevailed over a broad range of water depths, indicating vigorous deep ocean circulation.",

            "abstract": "The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is known as the period when ice volume reached its maximum and global temperature was lower than that of today. Accurate record of ice volume change requires relative sea-level reconstruction. Yokoyama et al. (2000) reported that the LGM terminated abruptly at 19 ka with a rapid rise (19 ka Event) using marine sediment cores from Bonaparte Gulf, Northwestern Australia. Although their reconstruction of the duration and magnitude of sea-level minima was confirmed to be reliable (cf. De Deckker and Yokoyama, 2009), relatively weaker evidence was presented for sea level during the time into the LGM. Partly because the number of their radiocarbon dates is insufficient to constrain the duration of LGM, thus further dating on sediment cores obtained from the key water depth (ca. 120m) is desired. Here we present the relative sea level record from Bonaparte Gulf using high-resolution radiocarbon dating. The result indicates that the duration of LGM is shorter than that from previous studies (cf, Yokoyama et al., 2000, Mix et al., 2001, Clark et al., 2009). Bonaparte Gulf is a far-field site located in a tectonically stable region. Consequently, this area is considered to be suitable for reconstructing accurate records of ice volume change. Using a marine sediment core (water depth: 120 m, length: 583 cm) taken from this region, we found the timing of LGM by reconstructing relative sea-level records. High-resolution radiocarbon dating of 23 shell samples and 26 bulk sediments is conducted to determine the precise relative sea-level records. Total organic carbon and total nitrogen as well as stable carbon isotope from bulk sediments are also employed for the paleo-environmental reconstruction caused by sea level change. Our result shows that the contributions from terrestrial organic matters were higher during the LGM than that for a sea-level highstand. This indicates that a sea-level lowstand occurred at ca. 21 ka and that ice volume in the high latitude continent could have changed rapidly during the LGM.",

            "abstract": "In polluted urban environments, windows and building surfaces rapidly become coated with a complex film of chemicals, which enhances the dry deposition of particles and the partitioning of semi-volatile organic species to the surface. Despite its high surface-to-volume ratio and direct exposure to sunlight, few studies have directly investigated the role that this “urban film” may play in promoting the photooxidative processing of semi-volatile organics contained within it. The present study represents a comprehensive field- and laboratory-based investigation of the film-phase photochemistry of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), here used as proxies for light-absorbing semi-volatile organics present within the film.\nUrban film sampling was conducted using a custom-built three-stage sampler housing, which was deployed in a central, high-traffic area in Leipzig, Germany. The sampler itself employs small glass beads as surrogate window surfaces and is designed such that only its uppermost stage is exposed to sunlight. Each stage is subdivided into 16 compartments, which allows for the study of film formation and evolution.\nIn the first phase of the study, the role of urban film as a photochemical sink for reactive organic species was determined by measuring total film PAH content and PAH abundance ratios as a function of atmospheric exposure time under both light and dark conditions.\nIn the second, more general, phase of the study, the organic and inorganic composition of collected film samples was compared to that of co-located PM10 samples, and differences between the two sample types were used to gain insight into the relative importance of heterogeneous photochemical oxidation within the particle and film phases.\nIn the third phase of the study, film samples grown under dark conditions were exposed to gas-phase ozone in an atmospheric-pressure flat-bed reactor, and the kinetics of ozone-induced PAH loss were studied under both dark and illuminated conditions. Since previous work from our group has shown that the heterogeneous photooxidation of PAH occurs at different rates and via different mechanisms depending on its immediate environment, this in situ study of PAH reactivity provides substantial insight into the photochemical processing of this class of compounds in urban environments.",

            "abstract": "The Mw 8.2, 2014, Pisagua earthquake in Northern Chile did not come as a complete surprise as it was anticipated that in the “near future” a large earthquake could happen in the North Chile seismic gap. Whether the gap would rupture in a single M~9 event or in several M 7-8 events has been subject of debate. Now it is clear that the Pisagua earthquake ruptured the shallower part of one segment of the North Chilean seismogenic subduction interface and leaves the questions why the new rupture started here and what could be a future scenario for the failure of the seismic gaps' residuals.\nTo identify seismogenic structures which define areas where large events might nucleate, asperities develop or segment boundaries form, we need large catalogues of accurately located seismic events in all magnitude ranges. Therefore, we apply a new method to automatically detect and locate seismic events based on the backprojection algorithm and multi-band kurtosis signal representation (see also abstracts Satriano et al. and Poiata et al.) using the data basis of the Iquique Local Network and the Integrated Plate Boundary Observatory in North Chile. Precise earthquake locations, seismicity rate changes and spatial b-value distributions can then refer to material boundaries, and distinguish between locked and creeping sections, which lead to the sites where actual deformation also on small scales is taking place.\nWhile seismicity distribution and its temporal changes help to identify the outlines of seismogenic structures, congruent gravity isostatic residual anomalies and modeled density distributions tell us something about the physical nature of earthquake nucleation zones and asperities. We present new results from density modeling on narrow profiles over the entire Pisagua earthquake rupture plane revealing dense bodies which we suggest have influenced the start of the main shock rupture as well as its propagation by linking spatial background and aftershock distributions.",

In the present work, sensitivity of Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) Model version 3.1.1, has been carried out with five PBL schemes – YSU, MYJ, ACM2, QNSE AND MYNN. The model performance has been evaluated over different climatic zones (Tropical, Temperate and Arid) over India. Simulated meteorological parameters – 2m temperature, 10m wind speed and direction, 2m humidity have been compared with observations through standard statistical measures. Boundary layer height computation methods are not coherent amongst PBL schemes, so large differences in predicted height is seen. Overall, model shows acceptable behavior but no particular scheme produces best performance for all parameters, locations and season. The goal is to study the relative performance of these schemes, selecting the option which overall shows best results and minimize uncertainty for future air quality simulations.",

            "abstract": "The plate boundary at the eastern terminus of the Azores-Gibraltar transform fault between Africa and Iberia is poorly defined. The deformation in the area is forced by the slow NW-SE convergence of 4 mm/yr between the oceanic domains of Iberia/Eurasia and Africa and is accommodated over a 200 km broad tectonically-active deformation zone. The region, however, is also characterized by large earthquakes, such as the 1969 Mw=7.9 Horseshoe event and the November 1, 1755 Great Lisbon earthquake with an estimated magnitude of Mw~8.5. The exact location of the source of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake is still unknown. Recent work may suggest that the event occurred in the vicinity of the Horseshoe fault, an oblique thrust fault. However, estimates of tsunami arrival times suggested a source near the Gorringe Bank, a ~180 km-long and ~70 km-wide ridge that has a relieve of ~5000 m. Deep Sea Drilling (DSDP) and rock samples indicated that the bank is mainly composed of serpentinized peridotites with gabbroic intrusions, perhaps being created by overthrusting of the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain onto the Tagus Abyssal Plain in NW direction. Further, the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain is marked by the presence of compressive structures with a roughly NE-SW orientation and E-W trending, segmented, crustal-scale, strike slip faults that extend from the Gorringe Bank to the Gibraltar Arc in the eastern Gulf of Cadiz, which were called “South West Iberian Margin” or SWIM faults. The fault system may mark a developing Eurasia-Africa plate boundary. Two local seismic networks were operated in the area. First, a network of 14 ocean-bottom seismometers (OBS) was operated between April and October 2012 in the vicinity of the Horseshoe fault between 10°W to 11°W, and 35°50’N to 36°10’N. From October 2013 to March 2014 a second network of 15 OBS monitored seismicity at the Gorringe Bank. Both networks benefitted from seismic stations operated in Portugal. The first network provided in the order of 100 locale earthquakes occurring with the network. Most earthquakes in the abyssal plain occurred at a depth of 40-60 km, either in oceanic or unroofed continental mantle. The large source depth of events in the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain supports the idea that large catastrophic earthquakes, like the Great Lisbon earthquake of 1755, may indeed occur in the area.",

            "abstract": "The Gakkel Ridge in the Arctic Ocean and the Southwest Indian Ridge in the Southwest Indian Ocean between Africa and Antarctica are ultraslow-spreading (<20 mm yr-1) mid ocean ridges. This type of mid ocean ridge has distinct geo-morphologies that are influenced by the slow rate of plate divergence and by mantle potential temperature, which control the processes (peridotite diapirism and intersticial melt migration) by which material rises to fill the space vacated by plate divergence. These ridges are characterised by non-orthogonal spreading. Transform faults, typical of faster spreading mid ocean ridges, are far less common at ultraslow spreading mid ocean ridges. Thus in return, detailed geo-statistical analyses of the geo-morphology of ultraslow-spreading mid ocean ridges can provide valuable information towards a better understanding of these slowest of spreading ridges. We have generated high resolution bathymetric grids for the Gakkel and Southwest Indian ridges based on high resolution multibeam echosounder data from various expeditions with RV Polarstern. On the basis of these grids, geo-statistical analyses allow for an assessment of the geo-morphological elements of the ridges on various scales. The results of these analyses show that, approximately 200 km long medium-scale sections of the ridges can be characterised by the lengths and orientations of the short-scale (hundreds of meters to tens of kilometres) ridges and troughs. The geomorphologies of short-scale ridges and troughs situated at the junctions between medium scale sections often exhibit a mixture of the geomorphological elements seen in the neighbouring sections. These geo-morphological patterns provide insights into the overall spreading-geometry along the Gakkel Ridge and the Southwest Indian Ridge.",

            "abstract": "Quartz is the most abundant mineral in the Earth’s crust and is found in virtually every geological context. Despite its ubiquity and the detailed studies on the conditions of quartz crystallization, some questions concerning its growth and sector zoning with regard to trace element incorporation and oxygen isotope fractionations and the implications thereof for interpretations on the conditions of formation remain (e.g., Jourdan et al., 2009). This study presents new in-situ measurements of trace element and oxygen isotope ratios on natural hydrothermal quartz from an extensional gold-bearing quartz vein in the western Swiss Alps. The temperature of formation of the veins is estimated by quartz-hematite oxygen isotope thermometry to be about 360°C. A detailed SEM-CL study of this sample shows cyclic lamellar growth, alternating with phases of dissolution that are directly followed by macro-mosaic growth of the quartz, before returning to a cyclic lamellar growth again.\nTrace element concentrations (measured for Na, K, Li, Al, and Ti) notably showed Al/Si variations of three orders of magnitude and coupled Al and Li variations, likely substituting for Si in different growth zones with lower values in macro-mosaic zones precipitating after the period of dissolution. The oxygen isotope composition of the crystal, in contrast, is homogeneous through all growth zones (δ18O values between 15.6‰ and 16.2‰) indicating that the fluid must have been buffered by the host-rock and/or the source of the fluid remained the same despite the period of quartz dissolution. Furthermore, the temperature during crystallization of the quartz crystal has likely also remained similar. The fact that no variations are measured in oxygen isotope compositions but some variations in trace element contents may suggest that changes in pressure were important during the formation of this quartz crystal. Give the pressure effects on the solubility of quartz (Fournier and Potter, 1982), both the cyclic character of quartz growth and perhaps also the changes in Al/Si may be related to pressure variations caused by seismic activity during retrograde Alpine metamorphism.\nA-L.

            "abstract": "The AD 1835 eruption of Cosigüina volcano, Nicaragua, produced ~6 km3 of tephra and had a global climate impact similar to that of the 1991 Pinatubo eruption. In this study, we aim to constrain the magmatic processes and their timescales that led to this eruption. Our results indicate that the 1835 eruption tapped a zoned, shallow (~4 km depth) magma reservoir; small volumes of crystal-poor dacite and silicic andesite were erupted first followed by crystal-rich andesite, which represents the bulk of the erupted magma. The compositions of bulk rocks, matrix glasses and melt inclusions are consistent with derivation of (1) the andesite from a basaltic andesite parent and (2) the silicic andesite and dacite from the andesite through liquid extraction and fractional crystallization. Bimodal crystal populations are interpreted to reflect a polybaric differentiation process in which calcic plagioclase (An75-90) formed from hot and hydrous andesitic to basaltic liquids in the lower crust whereas An50-65 plagioclase crystallized from cooler and partly degassed andesitic to dacitic liquids in the shallow magma reservoir. Mg diffusion chronometry applied to calcic plagioclase found in andesite and dacite constrains the residence time of these crystals in the silicic liquids to more than 100 and less than 2000 years, with detailed analysis of 3 crystals yielding 400 years. A mafic recharge event thus appears to have taken place a few centuries prior to 1835. Although the calculated timescales represent minimum differentiation times, we propose that magma reservoir zonation may have been established within 102-103 years at Cosigüina. Several thick, chemically zoned pyroclastic deposits are well exposed at a section 11 km west of the caldera, revealing the cyclic behavior of this volcano in the recent geologic past. If the oldest eruptions are of similar age to those of neighboring volcanoes (160-330 ka), a maximum recurrence time for repeated replenishment, magma reservoir zonation and eruption at Cosigüina is 1-2 x 104 years. Detailed geochronology is required to determine the frequency of explosive eruptions at this volcano.",

            "abstract": "The lowermost 300 km of mantle (D'') acts as the lower boundary layer to mantle convection. Numerous observations find that this layer is anisotropic, unlike the bulk of the lower mantle above, which is isotropic. The causal mechanism for this anisotropy remains elusive, though its organisation is likely to be imposed by deformation associated with mantle convection. The subduction of the Tethys ocean (since 180 Ma) is predicted to have deposited slab material in D'' in circum-Pacific regions, making these regions cold, encouraging the phase transformation in the MgSiO3 polymorph bridgmanite to a post-perovskite (ppv) structure. These regions are probably rich in ppv.\nHere we present new observations of anisotropy from shear wave splitting of ScS phases recorded in the epicentral distance range 50-85 degrees. These observations are corrected for anisotropy in the upper mantle beneath source and receiver. Due to the layout of events and receivers we primarily sample D'' beneath the landward side of the circum-Pacific. A detailed pattern of anisotropy is revealed. Anisotropy predominantly leads to SH fast wave propagation with an inferred average strength of 0.9%. This is consistent with many previous observations. However, we do not limit our observations to the SH/SV system. Many observations show non SH/SV fast polarisation. We interpret these data for tilted transverse isotropy (TTI) style anisotropy. We resolve non-radial anisotropy at unprecedented global scale, in turn placing new constraints on the D'' flow field.\nWe test the ability of the flow model TX2008 (Simmons et al., 2009) to fit our observations. This is achieved by modelling the development of a lattice preferred orientation texture of a ppv layer subject to this flow field using a visco-plastic self consistent theory (Walker et al., 2011). Due to uncertainty in the slip system of ppv three candidate glide planes are trialled: (100)/{110}, (010), and (001). The seismic anisotropy of these models is probed using the full wave field simulation code SPECFEM3D_GLOBE (Tromp et al., 2008). Using these synthetic seismograms we assess the ability of flow model TX2008 (assuming a ppv D'') to explain our observations, and determine which slip system fits the data best.",

            "abstract": "Water resources degradation is a complex environmental problem that involves multiple dimensions and scales of analysis. The Socio-Ecological Systems Water Metabolism has been proposed as a general holistic framework to deal with integrated analysis of water use sustainability (Madrid and Giampietro 2014). The innovation of the approach is that it sets the research focus beyond the classical supply-demand modeling to societal integrity and ecosystems integrity. To do so, it integrates quantitative grammars of water use (relating water exchange to societal and ecosystems organization) and qualitative methods (discourse analysis). This work presents the first case study focused at a river basin extent: the Upper Andarax, in South-East Spain. Water metabolism is indicated at multiple levels for ecosystems and society. To deal with the interfaces among them, relational indicators of water exploitation, water use and impact over ecosystems are used alongside policies and narratives analysis.While being a rather not intensively exploited river basin (year Water Exploitation Index~0.3 blue water,~0.15 green water), impacts over water bodies are yet important (periodic aquifer overdraft, biological degradation of the river) especially during dry season. Perceived mayor problems of water sustainability are generated by the not integration of different policies at European, national and regional scales: while the water authority establishes a compulsory reduction over water withdrawal to attend environmental flows, agricultural markets force to raise productivity increasing water demands. Adaptation strategies are divided among irrigation efficiency improvement and a reorientation of the economy towards touristic activities. Both of them entail specific trade-offs to be deemed. Aquifer-river interactions and climate change impacts are yet mayor research challenges.",

            "abstract": "We outline a new framework for assessing uncertainties in model simulations, be they hydro-ecological simulations for known scenarios, or climate simulations for assumed scenarios representing the future. This framework is illustrated here using GCM projections for future climates for hydrologically relevant variables (precipitation and temperature), with the uncertainty segregated into three dominant components – model uncertainty, scenario uncertainty (representing greenhouse gas emission scenarios), and ensemble uncertainty (representing uncertain initial conditions and states). A novel uncertainty metric, the Square Root Error Variance (SREV), is used to quantify the uncertainties involved. The SREV requires: (1) Interpolating raw and corrected GCM outputs to a common grid; (2) Converting these to percentiles; (3) Estimating SREV for model, scenario, initial condition and total uncertainty at each percentile; and (4) Transforming SREV to a time series. The outcome is a spatially varying series of SREVs associated with each model that can be used to assess how uncertain the system is at each simulated point or time. This framework, while illustrated in a climate change context, is completely applicable for assessment of uncertainties any modelling framework may be subject to.\nThe proposed method is applied to monthly precipitation and temperature from 6 CMIP3 and 13 CMIP5 GCMs across the world. For CMIP3, B1, A1B and A2 scenarios whereas for CMIP5, RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 representing low, medium and high emissions are considered. For both CMIP3 and CMIP5, model structure is the largest source of uncertainty, which reduces significantly after correcting for biases. Scenario uncertainly increases, especially for temperature, in future due to divergence of the three emission scenarios analysed. While CMIP5 precipitation simulations exhibit a small reduction in total uncertainty over CMIP3, there is almost no reduction observed for temperature projections. Estimation of uncertainty in both space and time sheds lights on the spatial and temporal patterns of uncertainties in GCM outputs, providing an effective platform for risk-based assessments of any alternate plans or decisions that may be formulated using GCM simulations.",

            "abstract": "Reduction in riverbed permeability due to biomass growth is a well-recognized yet poorly understood process associated with losing connected and disconnected rivers. Although several studies have focused on riverbed bioclogging processes at the pore-scale, few studies have quantified bioclogging feedback cycles at the scale relevant for water resources management, or at the meander-scale. At this scale, often competing hydrological-biological processes influence biomass dynamics and infiltration. Disconnection begins when declines in the water table form an unsaturated zone beneath the river maximizing seepage. Simultaneously, bioclogging reduces the point-scale infiltration flux and can either limit the nutrient flux and reduce bioclogging, or preferentially focus infiltration elsewhere and enhance bioclogging. These feedbacks are highly dependent on geomorphology and seasonal patterns of discharge and water temperature. To assess the mutual influences of disconnection, biomass growth, and temperature changes on infiltration in a geomorphologically complex river system, we built a 3D numerical model, conditioned on field data, using the reactive-transport simulator MIN3P. Results show that in disconnected regions of the river, biomass growth reduced vertical seepage downward and extended the unsaturated zone length; however these changes were contingent upon disconnection. Mid-way through the seasonal cycle, biomass declined in these same regions due to limited nutrient flux. Seepage and biomass continued to oscillate with a lag correlation of 1 month. Connected regions, however, showed the largest infiltration rates, nutrient fluxes, and concentrations of biomass. Despite the reduction in conductivity from biomass, flow remains high in connected regions because the feedback between bioclogging and infiltration is not as pronounced due to the sharpening hydraulic gradient. Bioclogging ultimately shapes the pattern of flow, however geomorphology dominates the strength of connection. Recognition of the feedbacks between geomorphological patterns and heterogeneous biomass on meander scale hydrological processes can lead to better estimates of local water volumes and capacities, especially when these systems are used as municipal and public water supply sources.",

            "abstract": "The Cloud-Aerosol Transport System (CATS), built at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center as a payload for the International Space Station (ISS), is set to launch in the late 2014. CATS is an elastic backscatter lidar operating in one of three science modes with three wavelengths (1064, 532, 355 nm) and HSRL capability at 532 nm. Depolarization measurements will be made at the 532 and 1064 nm wavelengths. The CATS science modes are described in Figure 1. The ISS orbit is a 51 degree inclination orbit at an altitude of about 405 km. This orbit provides more comprehensive coverage of the tropics and mid-latitudes than sun-synchronous orbiting sensors, with nearly a three day repeat cycle. Thus, science applications of CATS include cloud and aerosol climate studies, air quality monitoring, and smoke/volcanic plume tracking.\nCurrent uncertainties in cloud and aerosol properties limit our ability to accurately model the Earth’s climate system and predict climate change. These limitations are due primarily to difficulties in adequately measuring aerosols and clouds on a global scale. A primary science objectives of CATS is to provide global aerosol and cloud vertical profile data in near real time to for assimilation in aerosol transport models such as the NASA GEOS-5 model. Furthermore, the vertical profiles of cloud and aerosol properties provided by CATS will complement current and future passive satellite sensors.\nAnother important science objective of CATS is to advance technology in support of future mission development. CATS will employ 355 nm and HSRL capabilities, as well as depolarization at multiple wavelengths. These expanded measurement capabilities will provide the science community with new and improved global data products that have yet to be retrieved from space-based lidar. In preparation for launch, simulations of the CATS lidar signal are produced using GEOS5 model data to develop and test future data products. An example of the simulated CATS attenuated total backscatter for the 532 nm parallel channel is shown in Figure 2 using the GEOS-5 model forecast from 15 July 2009. This work provides an overview of the CATS mission, science objectives and simulated data.",

            "abstract": "Evidence for recent climate-wildfire linkages underscores the need for better understanding of relationships between wildfire and major climate shifts in Earth history, which in turn offers the potential for prognoses for wildfire and human adaptations to it. In particular, what are the links between seasonality and wildfire frequency and severity, and what are the feedbacks between wildfire, landscape evolution, and biogeochemical cycles, particularly the carbon and iron cycles? A key first step in addressing these questions is recovering well-described wildfire records from a variety of paleolandscapes and paleoclimate regimes. Although charcoal and organic biomarkers are commonly used indicators of fire, taphonomic processes and time-consuming analytical preparations often preclude their routine use in some environments and in high-stratigraphic resolution paleowildfire surveying. The phenomenological relationship between fire and magnetic susceptibility can make it a useful surveying tool, but increased magnetic susceptibility in sediments is not unique to fire, and thus limits its diagnostic power. Here we utilize component-specific rock magnetic methods and analytical techniques to identify the rock magnetic fingerprint of wildfire. We use a custom-designed air furnace, a series of iron-free laboratory soils, natural saprolites and soils, and fuels from Arizona Ponderosa pine forests and grasslands to simulate wildfire in a controlled and monitored environment. Soil-ash residues and soil and fuel controls were then characterized using First Order Reversal Curve (FORC) patterns, DC backfield IRM coercivity spectra, low-temperature SIRM demagnetization behavior, and low-temperature cycling of room-temperature SIRM behavior. We will complement these magnetic analyses with high-resolution TEM of magnetic extracts. Here we summarize the systematic changes to sediment magnetism as pyrolitized organic matter is incorporated into artificial and natural soils. These observations help us elucidate the processes and sources responsible for increases in magnetic susceptibility observed in natural burned soils, as well as identify a unique rock magnetic fingerprint for natural wildfire that has the potential to be preserved in sedimentary sequences in the geological record.",

The course has top students including ≤20% indigenous/foreign students; nonetheless, students’ backgrounds in math and science vary considerably posing challenges for learning. We are addressing this issue and aiming to improve knowledge retention and deep learning by changing our teaching approach.\nIn 2013-2014, we modified the weekly course structure to a 1hr lecture; a 2hr workshop with hands-on activities; a 2hr lab; an assessment piece covering all face-to-face activities; and a 1hr tutorial. Our new approach was aimed at: 1) building student confidence with data analysis and quantitative skills through increasingly difficult tasks in science, math, physics, chemistry, climate science and biology; 2) creating effective learning groups using name tags and a classroom with 8-person tiered tables; 3) requiring students to apply new knowledge to new situations in group activities, two 1-day field trips and assessment items; 4) using pre-lab and pre-workshop exercises to promote prior engagement with key concepts; 5) adding open-ended experiments to foster structured ‘scientific play’ or enquiry and creativity; and 6) aligning the assessment with the learning outcomes and ensuring that it contains authentic and challenging southern hemisphere problems. Students were asked to design their own ocean current experiment in the lab and we were astounded by their ingenuity: they simulated the ocean currents off Antarctica; varied water density to verify an equation; and examined the effect of wind and seafloor topography on currents.\nTo evaluate changes in student learning, we conducted surveys in 2013 and 2014. In 2014, we found higher levels of student engagement with the course: >~80% attendance rates and >~70% satisfaction (20% neutral). The 2014 cohort felt that they were more competent in writing and data analysis skills, working quantitatively using spreadsheets; deriving equations to describe nature; using the scientific method; and research processes. Assessment strategies are challenging and we plan to test a grading approach based on the \"three Cs\": content, correctness and creativity.",

The coarse resolution products are limited to larger water bodies and miss the many smaller lakes and ponds in the region.\nWe have created a time series of maps from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper in three epochs (1990 - 1992), (2000 - 2002), and (2010 - 2012) showing the location and extent of water bodies in the region. These maps represent the first comprehensive time series of water bodies in the region that have been generated with a consistent input data set at 30m spatial resolution. We can use these maps to quantify the amount of change that has occurred in the Arctic lakes over the past 20+ years. Here we will present the first versions of the maps with the associated structure and formats and some initial results from analysis of change in northern Canada.",

            "abstract": "There exists a large body of literature which demonstrates the existence of long-range memory scaling in climate time series, but there are very few papers that attempt to explain its origin. Huybers and Curry (2006) claim an apparent higher scaling exponent β>1 on time scales greater than a century, corresponding to a non-stationary time series. Lovejoy et al. (2013) also claim a break in the scaling, and denotes the stationary regime with β~0.1 on the time scales 10 days <τ<102 yr the macroweather regime and the non-stationary time-series on the scales τ>102 yr the climate regime.\nBy closer scrutiny, however, the break in scaling for ice-core records from Greenland and Antarctica seems to be a result of indiscriminate use of paleoclimatic records over periods that include both glacial and interglacial climate. By analysis of these time series for glacial and Holocene climate separately, the scale break in the Holocene is shifted to τ~103 yr, while it remains at τ~102 yr during the last glacial maximum, and is associated with the DO events. Moreover, the scaling for 103 < τ<104 yr is still stationary with β ~0.8. The scale break observed in some multiproxy data at τ~102  yr for global or hemispheric mean temperatures for the last two millennia is associated with an oscillation of period approximately 103 yr, involving the MWP and LIA. This oscillation can be attributed to a combination of volcanic and solar forcing. If we correct for this forced oscillation we obtain a consistent scaling with β~0.8 up to τ~103 yr, which match perfectly onto Holocene ice-core scaling for τ>103 yr. The low β ~0.1 observed for ice-cores at scales τ<103 yr is typical for local, continental temperature records, while the multiproxy scaling with β ~0.8 is typical for global temperature scaling in the Holocene. Thus, with exception of the millennium-period oscillation observed in global-scale multiproxy records there is consistent macroweather scaling in global temperature records with β~0.8 on all scales above the weather regime throughout the entire preindustrial Holocene.\nIn the industrial period an apparent scale break at τ~101 yr is due to the anthropogenic trend. After removal of this trend there remains an effect of a global oscillation of period ~60 yr associated with the AMO, but not really a break in scaling.",

            "abstract": "The rapid deposition of volcanogenic sediments, highly susceptible to alteration by seawater has led to distinct pore water geochemical profiles throughout the sedimentary basins of the Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc. Drilling at Site U1438, in the Amami-Sankaku Basin, recovered a 1300 m thick volcaniclastic section overlain by a 160 m thick section of sediments largely devoid of volcanic input. At Site U1438, 67 porewater samples were analyzed onboard for salinity, pH, oxidation-reduction potential and major and trace element concentrations. Here we focus on the depth profiles of elements which were also analyzed at Sites U1201, 792 and 793. Chloride and Bromide concentrations display similar trends; near constant in the upper 160 m and a linear downward increase to maximum concentrations from 600 mbsf onwards. This increase is likely caused by uptake of water by secondary minerals, resulting in chloride and bromide enrichment in the porewater. Calcium and magnesium porewater concentrations display opposite trends in the upper 440 m; the first increases from 11.5 to 140 mM, and the latter decreases from 53 mM until its depletion in the porewater. Leaching of Ca from the glass-rich sediments and underlying igneous basement are potential sources for Ca in the porewater, while Mg, Na and K presumably replace Ca through cation-exchange. Compared to Site U1438, similar trends of major elements concentration in the pore water were observed at the nearby Sites U1201 (serpentine mud volcano in the forearc of the Mariana subduction system), 792 and 793 (both in the Izu-Bonin forearc sedimentary basin). However, differences in depositional rates, thickness and age of the sedimentary basins, geothermal gradients and the influence of serpentine mud flows, have led to distinct pore water geochemical profiles.",

Eight days after the pulse, recently assimilated carbon was significantly higher in storage organs (rhizomes) of the grass Deschampsia flexuosa under elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration. Experimental drought induced a pronounced utilization of recently assimilated carbon belowground (roots, microbes, dissolved organic carbon) potentially counterbalancing limited nutrient availability. The fate of recently assimilated carbon was not affected by moderate warming. The full factorial combination of elevated CO2, warming and drought simulating future climatic conditions as expected for Denmark in 2075 did not change short-term carbon turnover significantly compared to ambient conditions.

This data set provides valuable information on the distribution and variation of mass in the Earth's subsystems such as atmosphere, hydrosphere, ocean and cryosphere. Reprocessed GRACE time-series of monthly gravity field spherical harmonic solutions generated at GFZ (RL05a) show significantly less noise and spurious artifacts. In addition, a regional method based on radial base functions that is capable to compute models in regional and global representation has been developed. This new method localizes the gravity observation to the closest regions and omits spatial correlations with farther regions. The present study makes use of both solutions in order to quantify recent ice-mass changes and their contribution to global sea-level rise. We further compare the ice-induced crustal deformations due to the dynamic (un-)loading of the crustal layer with GPS uplift measurements along Greenland's coastline. Mass/Volume changes derived from ICESat laser altimetry measurements both in Greenland and Antarctica are used to validate the GRACE results.",

            "abstract": "Mars is one of the terrestrial planets which are composed of rock and metal such as the Earth. There is no water, no life, and no plate tectonics on Mars, suggesting that Mars and Earth followed different evolutionary paths. Rheological structure, which indicates the deformation behavior and the strength of planetary interior, plays an important role in the evolution of planets. The rheological behavior of planetary interiors is strongly sensitive to temperature, which may produce strong rheological layering. Rheological structure of Mars in past must be different from the current rheological structure.\nFirst, the evolutions of temperature profiles in Mars are inferred from the surface heat flow and the heat conduction equation. The surface heat flow of Mars every 1 billion years was calculated from present abundances of the radioactive isotopes (235U, 235U, 232Th, and 40K) and their half-lives (Hahn et al 2011). Based on the temperature profile, we calculate the rheological structure of Mars every 1 billion years using flow-law of plagioclase and olivine. Calculated rheological structure shows that the brittle–ductile transition of present Mars, which is transition of deformation behavior from brittle failure to viscous flow, is deeper as compared with that of past Mars, suggesting that current elastic thickness also becomes thicker than that of past Mars. Under water–saturated conditions, the rheological structure which simulates the northern lowlands shows the strength contrast between the crust and mantle, indicating that the decoupling might occur at the Moho from 4 Ga to present day. Under dry conditions, lithosphere of northern lowlands has no strength contrast at the Moho, implying that crust and mantle might be coupled from 3 Ga to present day. Viscosity contrast between the surface and planetary interior is key for the mantle convection style (Moresi and Solomatov 1995), and the calculated viscosity contrast at present Mars is ~10-5 (Pa), suggesting that Mars must be in the stagnant-lid convection regime. In contrast, the viscosity contrast of Mars from 4 Ga to 3 Ga seems to be ~104 (Pa), suggesting that Mars might have the potential to perform the plate tectonics such as Earth.",

Geological longevity, areal distribution and importance in the global carbon cycle, however, make foraminifera particularly suitable to study the interplay between seawater chemistry and biogenic mineralogy. We assess global foraminifera abundances in the geological record from fossil species occurrences in the Paleobiology DataBase (PaleoDB; www.paleodb.org). Here, we present an analysis of the distribution of major groups of foraminifera through the Phanerozoic by comparing dominance of taxa producing aragonite or (low- and high-Mg) calcite in relation to changes in Mg/Casw and mass marine extinction events (P/T, T/J and K/Pg). This allows relating the effect of ocean chemistry to the relative success of foraminifera with different calcification strategies. We show for the first time that the success of foraminifera with different calcification mechanisms (i.e. aragonite versus calcite producers) is governed by Mg/Casw, potentially making foraminifera with unfavored mineralogy more vulnerable to major environmental perturbations. Furthermore, we suggest that planktic foraminifera, which are currently calcifying in a period with unfavorable sea water chemistry, might be more sensitive to on-going ocean acidification and associated environmental perturbations than currently assumed.",

The pressure that natural resources experience from population growth is a significant barrier to sustainable human development and ecological conservation. Integrating social and geographic data offers the potential to increase our understanding of population-environment relationships. We construct a village welfare index for an extensive area of Assam in Northeast India. Classification and regression tree techniques were used to model the relationships between welfare and geographic conditions derived from remotely sensed data. Geographic metrics accounted for 61% of the variation in the lowest welfare quintile and 57% in the highest welfare quintile. Travel time to market towns, percentage of a village covered with woodland and winter crop were significantly related to welfare. These results support findings in the literature across a range of different developing countries which have used socioeconomic and geographic data derived only from household surveys. Model accuracy is unprecedented considering that the majority of information for the prediction is derived from remotely sensed data. As satellite data can provide continually updated geographic metrics, the results indicate the potential for substantially increasing our understanding of poverty-environment relationships by coupling remotely sensed and socioeconomic datasets. Further studies should be conducted using time series analysis as knowledge of population-environment inter-linkages will be required to help foster more effective policies for sustainable human development and ecological conservation.",

            "abstract": "A major earthquake occurred on the plate boundary between the Nazca plate and the South American plate on April 1, 2014 in northern Chile associated with a tsunami that was recorded at the offshore DART buoys and the coastal tide gauges. The epicenter was located in a seismic gap called “Iquique gap”, but the moment magnitude was estimated to be 8.2 from the seismic wave analysis which was much smaller than the size of seismic gap. It is important to reveal the slip distribution of this earthquake in order to assess remaining tsunami risk in the region. We therefore carried out a tsunami inversion analysis for this earthquake. We used tsunami waveform data recorded at both of the offshore and coastal gauges, and 30 arc-sec interval bathymetric grid complied by the Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service of the Chilean Navy. We also examined effect of tsunami governing equations used in creating Green’s functions. One solution was obtained with the linear long-wave equations; the other was obtained with the linear dispersive equations. The effect of dispersive equations was found in tsunami waveforms in the open ocean. But that was not apparent in near-field records and the estimated slip distribution itself. The observed tsunami waveforms were retrieved well in the analysis except at Tocopilla where a large delay of tsunami arrival of about 10 minutes was seen in the observed data. Features of the estimated slip are 1) the slip extent was approximately 120km x 80km, 2) the major slip area was located to the south of the epicenter, a region off between Pisagua and Iquique, 3) the maximum slip was about 5m, 4) the seismic moment was calculated to be 1.28x10^21Nm (Mw 8.0).",

            "abstract": "The nature of the electron strahl population in the solar wind is a key diagnostic of the connectivity of the magnetic field to the solar atmosphere. As such, its measurement is fundamental to the success of the Solar Orbiter mission, with its scientific goals largely focussed around making the link between physical processes observed remotely in the near-Sun environment and the fields and particle populations detected in situ at the spacecraft. The Electron Analyser System (EAS) is part of the Solar Wind Analysers (SWA) suite of sensors which will be flown on the mission. It will make measurements of the 3D velocity distribution of electrons in the energy range of a few eV up to ~5 keV. In this presentation we first briefly review the expected capabilities of EAS. We then describe the strategies being developed to accurately categorize the electron strahl population with the sensor, with particular reference to our ongoing studies of relevant existing datasets from the Helios and Cluster missions.",

            "abstract": "We investigated 3-D P and S wave velocity (Vp, Vs) and attenuation (Qp and Qs) structures of the crust and upper mantle under the entire Northeast Japan arc from the Japan Trench to the Japan Sea coast. We used data from local shallow and intermediate-depth earthquakes recorded by a dense seismic network in Northeast Japan. Many suboceanic earthquakes under the Pacific Ocean and the Japan Sea are used and they are relocated precisely using sP depth phases. Vp and Vs tomography is determined using a large number of high-quality arrival-time data (Zhao et al., 2011; Huang and Zhao, 2013), whereas Qp and Qs tomography is obtained using a large number of t* data measured precisely from P and S wave spectra of local earthquakes (Liu et al., 2014). Our results reveal the high-V and high-Q subducting Pacific slab, and significant low-V and low-Q anomalies in the crust and mantle wedge under the volcanic front and the back-arc area. Large megathrust earthquakes (M > 6.0) during 1900-2013 including the great 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake (Mw 9.0) sequence are generally located in high-V and high-Q patches in the megathrust zone which are surrounded by low-V and low-Q anomalies. The high-V/high-Q patches in the megathrust zone generally exhibit large coseismic slips of megathrust earthquakes and large slip deficit on the plate interface. We think that these high-V/high-Q patches represent asperities in the megathrust zone resulting from subducted oceanic ridges, seamounts and other topographic highs, whereas the low-V/low-Q anomalies reflect weakly coupled or even decoupled areas which contain more subducted sediments and fluids associated with slab dehydration. Our tomographic images are in good agreement with results of active-source seismic surveys conducted in the Tohoku fore-arc region and the Japan Trench (e.g., Tsuru et al., 2002; Fujie et al., 2013). These results suggest that structural heterogeneities in the megathrust zone control the interplate seismic coupling and the nucleation of megathrust earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Two significant eruptions in Indonesia during the first part of 2014 have highlighted the continuing challenges of safe air traffic management around volcanic ash clouds. The stratospheric eruption of Kelut (also known as Kelud) in Java late on 13 February 2014 resulted in widespread aviation disruption over Indonesia and at least one serious volcanic ash encounter from an international airline. An upper-tropospheric eruption of Sangeang Api in the Lesser Sunda Islands on 30 May 2014 did not result in any known aircraft encounters, but did result in many delays and flight cancellations between Indonesia and Australia.\nIn both cases, the eruption and resultant ash clouds were relatively well observed, if subject to the usual issues in characterising such clouds. For example, as tropical eruptions frequently reach 15 km amsl and above due to the height of the tropical tropopause, it is frequently very difficult to provide an accurate estimation of conditions at the cruising levels of aircraft, at 10-11 km (or lower for shorter domestic routes).\nMore critically, the challenge of linking operational results from two scientific professions (volcanology and meteorology) with real-time aviation users remains strongly evident. Situational awareness of domestic and international airlines, ground-based monitoring and communications prior to and during the eruption, receiving and sharing pilot reports of volcanic ash, and appropriate flight responses all remain inadequate even in relatively fine conditions, with an unacceptable ongoing risk of serious aviation encounters should improvements not be made. Despite the extensive efforts of the International Civil Aviation Organization, World Meteorological Organization, and all partners in the International Airways Volcano Watch, and despite the acceleration of work on the issue since 2010, volcanic ash management remains sub-optimal.",

            "abstract": "On geologic time scales concentrations of atmospheric CO2, a greenhouse gas and critical mediator of Earth’s surface temperature and climate, is thought to be controlled by a balance between CO2 input from mantle degassing through volcanism and metamorphism and consumption via temperature-sensitive chemical weathering of tectonically uplifted continental rocks. This interplay between global climate and tectonic uplift also controls the delivery of cations to the oceans. Hence, past changes in seawater chemistry provide a powerful archive of the interplay and feedback between climate and tectonics. Mass Extinction Events, like that at K-Pg boundary, are characterized by rapid, global Carbon Cycle Perturbations either from increased mantle degassing or by incineration of the continents due to extra-terrestrial impact. It is hypothesized that enhanced chemical weathering of continental silicate rocks consumes this excess CO2 and restores steady-state.\nLithium, B, and Mg are conservative ions in seawater that are isotopically homogeneous with a residence time much longer than the oceanic mixing time. As a result, δ7LiSW, δ11BSW, and δ26MgSW, recorded by marine calcites reflect a global picture and secular variations in isotopic composition of these elements within periods shorter than their residence time must thus reflect imbalances between the sources and sinks of these elements to and from the ocean. Cenozoic δ7LiSW shows an abrupt 5‰ drop across the K-Pg boundary, simultaneous with the seawater Ir and Os isotope spikes. This rapid decrease in δ7LiSW is due to a large instantaneous delivery of isotopically light Li to the oceans and cannot be produced by an impactor nor by Deccan trap volcanism, suggesting large-scale continental denudation. We will create high-resolution δ7LiSW, δ11BSW, and δ26MgSW records across K-Pg boundary using planktonic and benthic foraminifera from multiple ODP/DSDP sites to quantify the amount of C excursion and the response of continental weathering feedbacks to regain climatic steady states. This multi-proxy approach will help quantify the extent of CCP; time scale and magnitude of continental chemical weathering response; and the contribution of both carbonate rock and silicate rock weathering in CO2 drawdown across carbon cycle excursion episodes.",

            "abstract": "Using teleseismic S-waves, VDSS treats the SV-to-P conversion under the free surface (on the station-side) as a virtual source to generate strong, post-critical reflection off the Moho (SsPmp phase). With just a single, good-quality earthquake, arrival-time difference between SsPmp and the direct S-phase (TSsPmp-Ss) can effectively determine the crustal thickness (H) near the receiver. However, there is a strong trade-off between H and P-wave speed (Vp) in the crust.\nHere we extend VDSS to constrain both H and Vp by taking advantage of the variation in ray-parameters, or incident angles, as a function of epicentral distance. Note that in conventional receiver functions, information contained in data of different ray-parameters is usually lost, because stacking over move-out corrected data is required to get a clear signal.\nAt a given station, we collect data from many events, each with a different ray-parameter of the direct S-phase (ps­). For each event, we 1) estimate the source wavelet of the direct S-wave through particle motion analysis; 2) deconvolve this wavelet from the vertical- and radial-component seismograms (Yu et al., GJI, 2013); and then 3) determine TSsPmp-Ss through waveform modeling. Finally, we analyze data pairs (ps2, T2SsPmp-Ss) to find the best-fitting values of H and Vp.\nSynthetic tests verify the robustness of the method even with 15% of white noise. Moreover, we applied the method to public domain data from Forrest (FORT), located in the Eucla basin of western Australia. Based on 30 earthquakes from a narrow back-azimuth range (105±15°) but with ps changing from 0.1221 to 0.1349 s/km, we estimate that near FORT, H and Vp are about 44±2 km and 6.67±0.35 km/s, respectively. This crustal thickness is consistent with previous reports – a surprisingly high value for a region where the elevation is less than 200 m. Together with the high Vp, our results imply that the crust has a dense, mafic component.",

These distances have been compared with the distances predicted by gas-dynamic models based on upstream plasma parameters measured by the ACE spacecraft. We analyze the oscillations of the standoff distance during multiple crossings in order to define a typical frequency of the bow shock motion and to find upstream origin of these fluctuations. We also compare the angles θBn (the angle between the magnetic field and the shock normal) retrieved by the timing method with the angles calculated by an iterative method based on Rankine–Hugoniot jump conditions.

            "abstract": "The spatial and seasonal dynamics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) composition and biodegradability were investigated for the five largest rivers in the Republic of Korea during the years 2012 – 2013 using dark incubation experiments and spectroscopic measurements, including parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The DOC concentrations of the rivers in relatively steep and forest-dominated basins were <~2 mg L-1, and remained relatively constant over the seasons. In contrast, those of the rivers influenced by urban and agricultural activities rose up to 5.4 mg L-1, which was decreased to ~2 mg L-1 during the summer monsoon period, indicating that increased precipitation had the effect of dilution. Among the fluorescence components, terrestrial humic-like components were dominant in all the rivers except for one, where tyrosine- or tryptophan-like compounds were the major component. However, terrestrial humic-like components became dominant in all five of the rivers after high precipitation which occurred during the monsoon season, during which ~76% of the annual precipitation was received. Considering that 64% of South Korea is forested, our results suggest that the forests could be a large source of riverine DOC, elevating the DOC loads during monsoon rainfall. Although more DOC could be degraded when DOC input increased, regardless of its sources, the percent biodegradability was reduced with increased proportions of terrestrially derived and aromatic compounds. These results suggest that the relatively stable and terrestrial humic-like compounds released during the monsoon rainfall could reduce the potential of microbial respiration of riverine DOC and evasion of river CO2 to the atmosphere, despite of the increase in the DOC load.",

Our work is to apply an optimal search strategy introduced by Zoi and Pinder[1], with some modifications, to a field site in Nanjing City, China to define the strength, and location of DNAPL sources using the least samples. The overall strategy uses Monte Carlo stochastic groundwater flow and transport modeling, incorporates existing sampling data into the search strategy, and determines optimal sampling locations that are selected according to the reduction in overall uncertainty of the field and the proximity to the source locations. After a sample is taken, the plume is updated using a Kalman filter. The updated plume is then compared to the concentration fields that emanate from each individual potential source using fuzzy set technique. The comparison followed provides weights that reflect the degree of truth regarding the location of the source. The above steps are repeated until the optimal source characteristics are determined. Considering our site case, some specific modifications and work have been done as follows. K random fields are generated after fitting the measurement K data to the variogram model. The locations of potential sources that are given initial weights are targeted based on the field survey, with multiple potential source locations around the workshops and wastewater basin. Considering the short history (1999-2010) of manufacturing optical brightener PF at the site, and the existing sampling data, a preliminary source strength is then estimated, which will be optimized by simplex method or GA later. The whole algorithm then will guide us for optimal sampling and update as the investigation proceeds, until the weights finally stabilized.\n",

The underlying reasons are unclear, whether this trend is due to natural or anthropogenic activities. Using a state-of-the-art global variable resolution climate model with high-resolution zooming over South-Asia, we decomposed the regional factors responsible for the weakening of monsoon circulation and rainfall. To address this issue we conducted several long simulations from 1886 to 2095, with and without anthropogenic forcing. The simulation provides key information about the regional responses to changes in south Asian summer monsoon, which leads to the decline in mean monsoon, and enhancement in the occurrence of localized extreme precipitation events in a warming climate. Further the 21st century climate projection using the same high-resolution model indicates persistent decrease of monsoonal rains due to land-atmosphere feedbacks in a warming environment. This would have severe impacts on agriculture, water resources and ecosystem over South Asia.",

            "abstract": "It is commonly accepted that the building of the continental crust is linked to subduction zone processes, but the refining mechanism isolating the felsic product from its basaltic counterpart, leading to a stratified crust, remains poorly understood. Delamination of subducting material and its subsequent melting and segregation, with the felsic part being underplated and added to the crust from below has been suggested to be a viable scenario.\nIn this study we use thermo-mechanical numerical models of subduction to explore the possibility of delamination of the igneous slab crust and determine the conditions that are required by varying key parameters, such as subduction speed and angle, slab age, crustal thickness and density, overriding plate thickness, mantle temperature, depth of eclogitisation and the rheological properties for crustal and mantle material. We also quantify the extent of the resultant crustal melting, and its composition.\nOur preliminary models demonstrate that for present day mantle potential temperatures and average slab crustal thickness, the slab crust may only delaminate for extreme rheologies (i.e very weak crust), making slab mafic crust delamination unlikely. Contrastingly, in an early earth setting (High mantle temperature potential and thicker mafic slab crust) we find that the whole crustal scale delamination of the subducting mafic crust is a dynamically viable mechanism for a reasonable rheology when slabs are younger than ~20Ma. The resulting delamination leads to buoyant upwelling and ponding of mafic crustal material beneath the overriding lithosphere. After only ~5 Myrs from the onset of delamination, delaminated mafic crust would sit in the hot mantle wedge, where it would likely cross its solidus. These melts would be readily segregated from the migmatitic mafic source and contribute to the formation of felsic crust with little interaction with the mantle wedge, explaining part of the spectrum of TTG forming the earliest continental crust.",

            "abstract": "For a seismic acquisition system, dynamic range is a very import indicator. This indicator reveals the maximum and minimum input signals can be distortionless converted from analog signal to digital signal. The seismic signal dynamic range is very wide, the total dynamic range is more than 160 dB. Nowadays, the broadband seismometers’ noise level is under 1μV, maximum output is exceed ±20V, dynamic range is more than 140dB. But the dynamic range of widely used seismic acquisition system based on ΣΔAD conversion is around 130dB@200SPS. This results in the seismic acquisition system’s 2 shortcomings in real usage: 1) for tiny signal recording, the resolution is not high enough, signal to noise ratio is low; 2) for huge earthquake recording, limiting phenomenon shows up. To achieve the wide dynamic range required by seismic observation, we raised up the multiple analog to digital converters method to extend the acquisition unit’s dynamic range.\nAlthough dynamic range of input seismic signal from seismometer is wide, but in practical application, for tiny signals (like signals below 1 mV), much more higher resolution is needed to improve signal to noise ratio, usually 1μV or even 0.1μV; but for large signals, the resolution around 10 μV to 0.1mV should be enough, the most concerned should be no limiting phenomenon when large signals arrived. Hence, to achieve both high resolution for tiny signal and full input range of large signal, we proposed a using multiple AD converters method to extend seismic acquisition unit dynamic range. That means using different resolutions for different amplitude level in analog to digital conversion: higher resolution for tiny signals and lower resolution for large signals. We divided the input signals to two levels: 0V～100mV and 100mV～40V. The experimental acquisition unit uses ADS1255 as AD converter. The embedded software reads the real time acquiring data, conducts linear compensation, zero offset voltage compensation, sensitivity consistent compensation, and then output 32 bits final results to record. The experimental results shows that when the sample rate is 50 SPS, the self noise RMS is around 0.2μV, the maximum output voltage is ±45V, and the dynamic range reaches 160 dB. That means this method is practical and effective in application.",

            "abstract": "Sub-Saharan Africa is an important focus for food security research, because it is experiencing unprecedented population growth, agricultural activities are largely dominated by smallholder production, and the region is already home to 25% of the world’s undernourished. One of the greatest challenges to monitoring and improving food security in this region is obtaining an accurate accounting of the spatial distribution of agriculture.\nHouseholds are the primary units of agricultural production in smallholder communities and typically rely on small fields of less than 2 hectares. Field sizes are directly related to household crop productivity, management choices, and adoption of new technologies. As population and agriculture expand, it becomes increasingly important to understand both the distribution of field sizes as well as how agricultural communities are spatially embedded in the landscape. In addition, household surveys, a common tool for tracking agricultural productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa, would greatly benefit from spatially explicit accounting of fields.\nCurrent gridded land cover data sets do not provide information on individual agricultural fields or the distribution of field sizes. Therefore, we employ cutting edge approaches from the field of computer vision to map fields across Sub-Saharan Africa, including semantic segmentation, discriminative classifiers, and automatic feature selection. Our approach aims to not only improve the binary classification accuracy of cropland, but also to isolate distinct fields, thereby capturing crucial information on size and geometry. Our research focuses on the development of descriptive features across scales to increase the accuracy and geographic range of our computer vision algorithm. Relevant data sets include high-resolution remote sensing imagery and Landsat (30-m) multi-spectral imagery. Training data for field boundaries is derived from hand-digitized data sets as well as crowdsourcing.",

            "abstract": "After the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan (Mw9.0), many papers on the source model of this mega subduction earthquake have been published. From our study on the modeling of strong motion waveforms in the period 0.1-10s, four isolated strong motion generation areas (SMGAs) were identified in the area deeper than 25 km (Asano and Iwata, 2012). The locations of these SMGAs were found to correspond to the asperities of M7-class events in 1930's. However, many studies on kinematic rupture modeling using seismic, geodetic and tsunami data revealed that the existence of the large slip area from the trench to the hypocenter (e.g., Fujii et al., 2011; Koketsu et al., 2011; Shao et al., 2011; Suzuki et al., 2011). That is, the excitation of seismic wave is spatially different in long and short period ranges as is already discussed by Lay et al.(2012) and related studies. The Tohoku earthquake raised a new issue we have to solve on the relationship between the strong motion generation and the fault rupture process, and it is an important issue to advance the source modeling for future strong motion prediction.\nThe previous our source model consists of four SMGAs, and observed ground motions in the period range 0.1-10s are explained well by this source model. We tried to extend our source model to explain the observed ground motions in wider period range with a simple assumption referring to the previous our study and the concept of the characterized source model (Irikura and Miyake, 2001, 2011). We obtained a characterized source model, which have four SMGAs in the deep part, one large slip area in the shallow part and background area with low slip. The seismic moment of this source model is equivalent to Mw9.0. The strong ground motions are simulated by the empirical Green’s function method (Irikura, 1986). Though the longest period limit is restricted by the SN ratio of the EGF event (Mw~6.0) records, this new source model succeeded to reproduce the observed waveforms and Fourier amplitude spectra in the period range 0.1-50s. The location of this large slip area seems to overlap the source regions of historical events in 1793 and 1897 off Sanriku area. We think the source model for strong motion prediction of Mw9 event could be constructed by the combination of hierarchical multiple asperities or source patches related to histrorical events in this region.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the vertical profile of atmospheric aerosols plays a vital role in utilizing spaceborne, column-integrated satellite observations. The properties and distribution of light-absorbing aerosol are particularly uncertain despite significant air quality and climate ramifications. Advanced retrieval algorithms are able to derive complex aerosol properties (e.g., wavelength-dependent absorption coefficient and single scattering albedo) from remote-sensing measurements, but quantitative relationships to surface conditions remain a challenge. Highly systematic atmospheric profiling during four unique deployments for the NASA DISCOVER-AQ project (Baltimore, MD, 2011; San Joaquin Valley, CA, 2013; Houston, TX, 2013; Denver, CO, 2014) allow statistical assessment of spatial, temporal, and source-related variability for light-absorbing aerosol properties in these distinct regions. In-situ sampling in conjunction with a dense network of AERONET sensors also allows evaluation of the sensitivity, limitations, and advantages of remote-sensing data products over a wide range of conditions.\nIn-situ aerosol and gas-phase observations were made during DISCOVER-AQ aboard the NASA P-3B aircraft. Aerosol absorption coefficients were measured by a Particle Soot Absorption Photometer (PSAP). Approximately 200 profiles for each of the four deployments were obtained, from the surface (25-300m altitude) to 5 km, and are used to calculate absorption aerosol optical depths (AAODs). These are quantitatively compared to AAOD derived from AERONET Level 1.5 retrievals to 1) explore discrepancies between measurements, 2) quantify the fraction of AAOD that exists directly at the surface and is often missed by airborne sampling, and 3) evaluate the potential for deriving ground-level black carbon (BC) concentrations for air quality prediction. Aerosol size distributions are used to assess absorption contributions from mineral dust, both at the surface and aloft. SP2 (Single Particle Soot Photometer) mixing state and coating thickness analyses will be explored to explain in-situ/AERONET discrepancies, and ground-based absorption coefficient and BC-mass observations will be utilized whenever possible to fully obtain the true absorption vertical profile.",

            "abstract": "The 25 October 2010 Mw 7.8 Mentawai earthquake is a tsunami earthquake that occurred near-trench and produced much larger tsunami with respect to its magnitude. Following this tsunami earthquake, rapid and substantial postseismic deformation has occurred, and has been recorded by the Sumatran GPS Array (SuGAr). The amount of the postseismic deformation comprised ~30% of the displacement measured in the day of the earthquake [Hill et al., 2012]. Up to the present, the accumulated postseismic displacements have largely exceeded the coseismic displacements at a few nearby SuGAr stations. This large postseismic deformation cannot be explained by viscoelastic relaxation, which we estimate generated <1 cm displacements for this extremely shallow event. Therefore, the majority of the postseismic deformation can be explained only by afterslip.\nThe ratio of horizontal to vertical afterslip displacements has decreased over time, suggesting that afterslip occurred likely downdip of the coseismic rupture and may have moved progressively farther downdip. However, because SuGAr has limited spatial resolution at shallow depths, it is difficult to model the exact location and evolution of afterslip using GPS data and kinematic inversion only. Therefore, we use rate-and-state frictional slip models driven by coseismic stress changes to model the afterslip of this tsunami earthquake.\nTo model afterslip with velocity-strengthening characteristics, we divide the slab interface into small patches and assign them with frictional properties including a-b, confining pressure, characteristic slip distance, and reference velocity. By comparing the model predictions with the time series data in the Simulated Annealing framework, we explore the range and spatial variations of the frictional parameters. We also discuss the effects of using different coseismic slip distributions and layered media. Using this physics-based modeling technique, we are able to fit the postseismic time series very well, and the results indicate afterslip indeed occurred downdip of the coseismic patch and moved progressively farther downdip. We demonstrate that stress-driven frictional slip models are particularly useful for resolving low-resolution regions in kinematic inversion models.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric rivers are long and narrow plumes that carry moisture over land along frontal zones associated with mid-latitude storms. They can account for 90% of the horizontal moisture transport in a given day and are responsible for major flooding, particularly along western coastal regions (western coasts of North America and Europe). It is therefore crucial to well simulate these events in climate models in order to improve predictions and attributions of heavy precipitation and flooding along western coastal regions.\nIn this study, we investigate the ability of a state-of-the art climate model to represent the location, frequency and structure of atmospheric rivers affecting Western Europe and California.\nBy making use of the UPSCALE (UK on PRACE: weather resolving Simulations of Climate for globAL Environmental risk) campaign, a traceable hierarchy of global atmospheric simulations (based on the Met Office Unified Model, GA3 formulation), with mesh sizes ranging from 130 km to 25 km, we study the impact of improved representation of small-scale processes on the mean climate, its variability and extremes in order to understand the processes underlying observed improvement with higher resolution. Five-member ensembles of 27-year, atmosphere-only integrations are available at these resolutions, using both present day forcing and a future climate scenario.\nDemory et al (2014) have already shown that a relatively coarse resolution limits the model’s ability to simulate moisture transport from ocean to land. This is particularly true at mid-latitude, where the transport is dominated by eddies. Increasing horizontal resolution increases eddy transport of moisture at mid-latitudes. Here, we investigate the climatology of atmospheric rivers, in particular their frequency and associated precipitation, compared to reanalysis products. Some aspects of the relationship between the improved simulation of moisture transport in current climate conditions, and how this impacts changes in atmospheric rivers in the future climate, with much larger atmospheric moisture availability, will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The Alto Tiberina fault (ATF) is a low-angle (east-dipping at 15°), 70 km long normal fault (LANF) located in the Umbria-Marche Apennines (central Italy), an area characterized by a SW-NE oriented extension occurring at rates of ~2 mm/yr. Active extension is precisely measured by a dense distribution of GPS stations belonging to several networks, thanks also to additional sites recently installed in the framework of the INGV national RING network and of the ATF observatory. Advanced Interferometry SAR (A-InSAR) techniques play today a key role in Earth Sciences thanks to their capability to detect and monitor slow surface movements over wide areas. A-InSAR techniques, along with in-situ ground measurements, can provide suitable information on the causes of interseismic (seismic, creep) movements. Large datasets of SAR images of European (ERS 1-2 and ENVISAT) and Italian (COSMO-SKyMed) satellites have been used to retrieve surface velocity maps and relevant time series from 1992 to 2014, along both ascending and descending orbits. A network of artificial Corner Reflectors has also been deployed in the proximity of some GPS sites in order to calibrate the processing results of the COSMO-SkyMed SAR data-set and to derive velocity maps.\nWe use an elastic Block Modeling (BM) approach in order to model GPS data by considering the major fault systems as bounds of rotating blocks, while estimating geodetic fault slip-rates.,Thanks to the latest imaging of its deep structure obtained from seismic profiles, the ATF is represented as a complex rough surface with the goal of evaluating the distribution of interseismic fault coupling. The preliminary results obtained show firstly that the observed extension is partially accommodated by interseismic deformation on the ATF, highlighting the important role of this LANF inside an active tectonic contest. Secondarily, using the ATF surface “topography”, we found for the resolved areas an interesting correlation between microseismicity and creeping portions of the ATF.\nThus we integrate A-InSAR results and GPS velocities in order to use such data within a BM approach, with the aim that the availability of high-resolution data will contribute to understand better the behavior of this LANF and to evaluate the seismic potential associated to this geologic structure.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric aerosols have the ability to act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), initiating the formation of clouds and hereby influencing the climate system. The ability of aerosols to act as CCN is believed to depend on particle size and chemical composition. Organosulfates (OS), e.g sulfate esters, have been observed as constituents of secondary organic aerosols in numerous atmospheric environments, even as far as the Arctic, where OS have been found to comprise 7-15% of total organic matter and 9-11% of submicron organic matter in two independent studies. However, the properties of particulate OS have not yet been investigated.\nHere limonene derived OS were synthesized and the hygroscopic properties of these OS and their mixtures with ammonium sulfate (AS) were examined through a series of laboratory experiments.\nLaboratory generated particles of limonene-derived OS and AS were analysed using a unique set-up splitting the particle flow between a Hygroscopicity Tandem Diﬀerential Mobility Analyzer and a Cloud Condensation Nuclei counter, enabling simultaneous measurements of hygroscopic growth and CCN activation.\nLimonene-derived OS were chosen as study components, since monoterpenes (including limonene) have been identified as important precursors of OS in field samples as well as in smog chamber experiments. AS was used as a representative of the inorganic fraction in atmospheric aerosols.\nThe preliminary results show that limonene-derived OS exhibit weak hygroscopic growth as well as CCN activation potential, however, not as strong as AS. For the organic-inorganic mixtures, it was observed that AS dominated the hygroscopic properties over the limonene-derived OS and became dictating for the measured values of hygroscopic growth and CCN activation, when the mass fraction of AS reached 20% or above.\nThe results will be discussed further and supplementary measurements of OS surface tension and water activity will be presented.",

The method deforms the mesh - initially a sphere - until the set of synthetic images, created from the mesh (Jorda et al., SPIE 2010) match the observed one.\n Stereo control points can be used as a constraint in the deformation of the mesh, but it is not required at low resolutions.\nThis new technique has been applied to images of the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko acquired by the OSIRIS instrument aboard the Rosetta spacecraft. The technique allowed to reconstruct the shape of the nucleus and to retrieve its rotational parameters from low-resolution images obtained with the narrow-angle camera of OSIRIS in mid-July 2014, when stereo-based techniques were still inapplicable. This model called \"SHAP1\" has been delivered to ESA and to the lander team in July. The technique has also been applied to higher-resolution images of the nucleus later on, using the stereo information as a constraint. A comparison of the reconstructed global and local models with those retrieved with other techniques, such as stereophotoclinometry (Gaskell et al., MPS 2008) and stereophotogrammetry (Preusker et al., PSS 2012) will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Several research groups around the world collect instrumental temperature data and combine them in different ways to obtain global gridded temperature fields. The three most well known datasets are HadCRUT4 produced by the Climatic Research Unit and the Met Office Hadley Centre in UK, one produced by NASA GISS, and one produced by NOAA. Recently Berkeley Earth has also developed a gridded dataset. All these four will be compared in our analysis.\nThe statistical properties we will focus on are the standard deviation and the Hurst exponent. These two parameters are sufficient to describe the temperatures as long-range memory stochastic processes; the standard deviation describes the general fluctuation level, while the Hurst exponent relates the strength of the long-term variability to the strength of the short-term variability. A higher Hurst exponent means that the slow variations are stronger compared to the fast, and that the autocovariance function will have a stronger tail. Hence the Hurst exponent gives us information about the persistence or memory of the process.\nWe make use of these data to show that data averaged over a larger area exhibit higher Hurst exponents and lower variance than data averaged over a smaller area, which provides information about the relationship between temporal and spatial correlations of the temperature fluctuations. Interpolation in space has some similarities with averaging over space, although interpolation is more weighted towards the measurement locations. We demonstrate that the degree of spatial interpolation used can explain some differences observed between the variances and memory exponents computed from the various datasets.",

            "abstract": "Fluid flow logs measured in boreholes provide information on the location and quantity of water from productive regions or fractures intersecting a well. For many applications, the flow may be time varying, in which case many logs, possibly in quick succession, would need to be taken. Recent field studies by our team have shown the potential of Active-Distributed Temperature Sensing (A-DTS) methods to produce high-frequency fluid flow logs. In the A-DTS method, resistive heating is applied across the conducting materials in the cable, uniformly warming the cable. When installed in a flowing fluid, the DTS measured temperature in a heated cable is a function of the flow velocity, since a faster flowing fluid will more effectively cool the cable.\nA flume trial was conducted to test the sensitivity of the A-DTS method for fluid velocity measurement in a controlled environment. The fiber-optic cable was fixed inside a test chamber through which the flow was channelled, with the velocity measured by Ultrasonic Doppler Velocimeters. The laboratory set-up allowed for the key variables to be examined. These included the heating rate (power per unit length of heated cable), and incidence angle of the flow to the cable.\nThe coupled fluid flow and heat transfer was numerically modelled. In addition to establishing the temperature-velocity relationship for a range of heating rates and cable configurations, the numerical model allowed the design of the cable itself, including material thermal properties and thicknesses, to be tested. The results should allow the sensitivity of subsequent A-DTS systems constructed for fluid flow monitoring to be optimised through appropriate cable materials and positioning in the borehole.",

            "abstract": "The intersection between the Gloria Fault (GF) and the Tore-Madeira rise (TMR) in NE Atlantic marks a transition from a discrete to a diffuse nature along a critical segment of the Eurasia/Africa plate boundary.\nTo the West of such intersection, approximately since the Azores triple junction, this plate boundary is mostly characterized by a set of closely aligned and continuous strike-slip faults that make up the narrow active dextral transcurrent system of the GF (with high magnitude M>7 historical earthquakes). While intersecting the TMR the closely E-W trending trace of the GF system is slightly deflected (changing to WNW-ESE), and splays into several fault branches that often coincide with aligned (TMR related?) active volcanic plugs. The segment of the plate boundary between the TMR and the Gorringe Bank (further to the East) corresponds to a more complex (less discrete) tectonic configuration, within which the tectonic connection between the Gloria Fault and another major dextral transcurrent system (the so called SWIM system) occurs. This SWIM fault system has been described to extend even further to the East (almost until the Straits of Gibraltar) across the Gulf of Cadiz domain. In this domain the relative movement between the Eurasian and the African plates is thought to be accommodated through a diffuse manner, involving large scale strain partition between a dextral transcurrent fault-system (the SWIM system), and a set of active west-directed én-échelon major thrusts extending to the North along the SW Iberian margin.\nWe present new analog modeling results, in which we employed different experimental settings to address (namely) the following main questions (as a first step to gain new insight on the tectonic evolution of the TRM-GF critical intersection area): Could the observed morphotectonic configuration of such intersection be simply caused by a bathymetric anomaly determined by a postulated thickened oceanic crust, or is it more compatible with a crustal rheological (viscous) anomaly, possibly related with the active volcanism in the intersection zone? What could cause the observed deflection and splaying of the GF in the intersection with the TMR? Is the GF cutting across the TMR, or is it ending against a morpho-rheological anomaly through waning lateral propagation?",

            "abstract": "The Corinth rift, Greece, is a young, highly active rift. A combined dense network of marine geophysical data and onshore exposure makes Corinth a natural laboratory for investigating early rift and fault formation. Rifts commonly develop a primary polarity during their formation resulting from a dominant fault set. However, how this occurs and develops is less clear. Here we characterise this process by establishing how a dominant fault set develops within the Corinth rift. Using a high spatio-temporal resolution chronostratigraphic and rift fault model, we investigate the variations in the distribution of displacement and faulting along and across the rift axis; focussing on the partitioning of deformation between N- and S-dipping faults, at a temporal resolution of ca. 100 kyr or less.\nAlong-strike cumulative fault displacement profiles indicate overall equal distribution of strain between major S- and N-dipping faults over the last ca. 1.5 Myr. In detail, two peaks in cumulative displacement coincide with the early development of two discrete depocentres before ca. 600 ka. Since this time, displacement has become focussed on N-dipping faults with S-dipping faults becoming less active. Syn-rift isochore maps illuminate this change: a switch in rift polarity from a dominant N-thickening depocentre to a dominant S-thickening depocentre between ca. 530-420 kyr (a rapid change in rift structure and strain distribution). This change is accommodated by transfer of activity between major faults but also by formation of numerous non-basement cutting small faults. As major S-dipping faults decrease in slip rate from ca. 600 ka, they become segmented into smaller faults with variable slip rates. In contrast, N-dipping faults on the rift’s southern margin, with increased activity post ~0.5-0.4 Ma, become kinematically and geometrically linked with almost equal slip rates along strike by ca. 130 kyr, controlling the single major depocentre of the present day.\nOur results show that the early evolution of a rift fault network can be complex but that a dominant fault set eventually forms even in the earliest stages of rifting. A switch in rift polarity is a progressive process with deformation becoming distributed before localizing onto a final dominant fault set, but this process can occur rapidly on a timescale of 100’s kyr.",

On DARWIN, users can search interested cruises and dives with a combination search form or an interactive tree menu, and find lists of observation data as well as links to surrounding databases. Document catalog, physical sample databases, and visual archive of dive surveys (e. g. in http://www.godac.jamstec.go.jp/jmedia/portal/e) are directly accessible from the lists. In 2014, DARWIN experienced an update, which was arranged mainly for enabling on-demand data visualization. Using　login users’ functions, users can put listed data items into the virtual basket and then trim, plot and download the data. The visualization tools help users to quickly grasp the quality and characteristics of observation data.\nMeanwhile, JAMSTEC launched a new data site named \"JDIVES (http://www.godac.jamstec.go.jp/jdives/e)\"　to visualize data and sample information obtained by dive surveys. JDIVES shows tracks of dive surveys on the \"Google Earth Plugin\" and diagrams of deep-sea environmental data such as temperature, salinity, and depth. Submersible camera images and links to associated databases are placed along the dive tracks. The JDVIES interface enables users to perform so-called virtual dive surveys, which can help users to understand local geometries of dive spots and geological settings of associated data and samples.\nIt is not easy for individual researchers to organize a huge amount of information recovered from each cruise and dive. The improved visibility and accessibility of JAMSTEC databases are advantageous not only for second-hand users, but also for on-board researchers themselves.",

            "abstract": "Io's volcanic activity is driven by the dissipation of energy in its interior due to tidal forces exerted by Jupiter, maintained by its orbital resonances with Europa and Ganymede. The 2011 discovery of a global partial melt layer beneath Io's surface has raised further questions about the structure of the Galilean moon and the processes that shape it. In this study we use two coupled simulations, the MFIX multiphase dynamics and the TiRADE tidal heating models, to investigate the location and extent, thermal state, melt fraction, stability, and migration of melt Io's viscous asthenosphere.\nWe explore the feedback between melt migration and production, taking into account the rate of tidal heating and melt migration through the magma ocean layer. We begin with an assumed 1D layered internal structure based on previous investigations. This structure is input into TiRADE, which solves the equations of motion for forced oscillations in a layered spherical body using the propagator matrix method to obtain the displacements and strains due to tidal forcing. From this, we obtain the radial distribution of tidal heat generation within Io. This heating profile is then used as input for the MFIX multiphase fluid model in order to obtain the vertical flow of partially molten material, as well as the radial temperature distribution and thus the material properties and melt fractions. In the multiphase model, individual phases (melt and solid residue) separately conserve mass, momentum and enthalpy allowing us to explore melt segregation phenomena. Enthalpy closure is provided by the MELTS thermodynamics algorithm, which is called at each point in space, accounting for the partitioning between latent and sensible heat, and updating the physical properties of the melt and solid phases. This approach allows us to explore the sensitivity of melt generation to internal structure, as well as the time scales that govern melt production and eruption (i.e.: the residence and migration time scales).",

            "abstract": "The invasive plant, Impatiens glandulifera (Himalayan Balsam), is now found in most European countries, as well as across large parts of North America and on some Australasian islands. It favours damp, nutrient-rich soils that experience frequent natural disturbance, such as riparian zones. Its ability to out-compete native vegetation and tendency to suffer rapid dieback during cold weather has led to speculation that it may promote soil erosion, particularly along riverbanks. Despite the strong implication, its ability to promote erosion has only recently been shown during an investigation over one dieback and regrowth cycle along a small watercourse in northwest Switzerland. This presentation now benefits from additional results covering further dieback and regrowth cycles obtained from the same watercourse as above, and from a different river system in southwest UK. These additional results support the original conclusion that I. glandulifera promotes soil erosion along riverbanks and the riparian zone. Importantly, the equivalent ground surface retreat from each group of contaminated locations over the three dieback and regrowth cycles are comparable with erosion in regions where high magnitude events are often recorded. Given these very high erosion rates, albeit over three monitoring phases, it is hypothesised that I. glandulifera may act as a catalyst for repeat cycles of colonisation, dieback and extreme erosion. Aside from the deleterious effect of large quantities of nutrient-rich sediment entering into watercourses, high magnitude soil loss such as this could result in reach-scale sections of riverbank undergoing profound morphological changes and reduced structural stability. Dynamic modifications such as those could ultimately impede the ability of riverbanks to moderate stream flow and offer flood protection, as well as hamper the capacity of riparian zones to buffer and retain sediment and associated contaminants during their passage from terrestrial to aquatic environments. Given the dearth of effective intervention measures to halt, or even slow, the spread of I. glandulifera, the impact of extreme erosion driven by this invasive plant could eventually affect the ecohydromorphic functioning of whole river systems, thus making their management extremely difficult and complex.",

It is, therefore, impossible to make a low velocity and low density layer – required for buoyant stability – at the top of the core by changing the concentration of a single light element; replacement of one light element with another is required. Assuming a bulk core with a given composition in oxygen and silicon, a layer containing more oxygen and less silicon can satisfy the observation of a low velocity layer along with the requirement that it has a lower density.\nThe F-layer at the bottom of the core is easier to account for, since decreasing the concentration of any light-element leads to lower velocity and simultaneously a higher density required for dynamic stability. An F-layer with low oxygen compared to the bulk core of would provide the observed velocity drop and be denser. However, the density increase is probably too large in view of the observed density jump between the inner and outer core. An alternative is to remove oxygen while increasing the silicon concentration.",

            "abstract": "Climate warming and permafrost thaw in northeastern Siberia are expected to change the quantity and quality of organic matter (OM) transported through watersheds, releasing previously frozen carbon (C) to biologically available pool. Hill slopes have shown to influence the distribution of OM, resulting in a downhill accumulation of available C and nutrients relative to uphill. Here we examine how future permafrost thaw will change OM quality and availability along a hill slope in a larch-dominated watershed. We collected soils from the thawed organic and mineral layers, and 1m deep permafrost cores for dissolved organic C (DOC) and total dissolved N (TDN), C composition from measures of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), DOC lability from biodegradable DOC (BDOC) incubations, C and nutrient availability from extracellular-enzyme assays (EEA’s), and microbial respiration from aerobic soil incubations. Here we show that organic soils (O), in comparison to mineral soils (M) and permafrost (P) are the most abundant source of C (avg O DOC: 51.6mg/L), exhibiting low molecular complexity (avg O SUVA254: 4.05) and high quality. Evidence suggests permafrost OM may be an equally abundant, and more labile source of C than mineral soils (highest P DOC: 16.1 mg/L, lowest P SUVA254: 6.32; median M DOC: 18.5 mg/L, median M SUVA254: 24.0). Furthermore, we demonstrate that there may be a positive relationship in the rate of C mineralization and distance downhill, showing 15-30% greater CO2 production/gC downhill relative to uphill. Evidence also supports a similar relationship in permafrost DOC content and molecular complexity, showing more DOC of a lower complexity further downhill. This indicates DOC transport may have been occurring through the active layer and downhill during ice-rich permafrost formation, and may supply a labile source of carbon to lowland areas and adjacent stream networks upon thaw.",

Snowcloud is an embedded data collection system for snow hydrology field research campaigns that leverages distributed wireless sensor network technology to provide data at low cost and high spatial-temporal resolution. The system is compact thus allowing it to be deployed readily within dense canopies and/or steep slopes. The system has demonstrated robustness for multiple-seasons of operation thus showing it is applicable to not only short-term strategic monitoring but extended studies as well. We have used data collected by Snowcloud deployments to develop improved models of snowpack evolution using genetic programming (GP). Such models can be used to augment existing sensor infrastructure to obtain better areal snow depth and snow-water equivalence estimations.\nThe presented work will discuss three multi-season deployments and present data (collected at 1-3 hour intervals and a multiple locations) on snowdepth variation throughout the season. The three deployment sites (Eastern Sierra Mountains, CA; Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH; and Sulitjelma, Norway) are varied not only geographically but also terrain-wise within each small study area (~2.5 hectacre). We will also discuss models generated by inductive (GP) learning, including non-linear regression techniques and evaluation, and how short-term Snowcloud field campaigns can augment existing infrastructure.",

            "abstract": "Despite two large historical earthquakes documented in 1694 and 1909 near the Taipei area of northern Taiwan, relatively low seismicity has been recorded instrumentally since 1973, with the largest event being magnitude 5.1 in 1988 beneath the Tatun volcano group. Low spatial correlation of seismic activity with the three known Pliocene-Pleistocene faults across the area, all trended NE-SW (Fig. 1), suggests that the relation between preset interseismic stress accumulation and the active faults of the Taipei area should be analyzed to provide independent information for seismic hazard evaluation other than the previous paleoseismic researches. With GPS data from 29 continuous stations observed from 2006 to 2013 and 83 campaign GPS sites surveyed since 2002 in the Taipei region, we employed the GAMIT/GLOBK software to calculate the time series of station positions under the ITRF2005 reference frame and therefore to estimate the regional velocity field. The influences of earthquakes and changing instruments have been evaluated and removed, and we also reduced the common-mode errors by using a spatial filtering technique to reduce the scattering effect in the time series. Our results show that the velocity field is about 2.1 ~ 5.1 mm/yr, in azimuths between 5 and 75 degrees, relative to the Paisha GPS site (S01R) at Panghu that has been considered as a stable continental margin station. Our plane strain analysis revealed a substantial NW-SE extension strain rate of about 0.2 mstrain/yr in an area of ~40-km wide across the Sanchiao fault and the Taipei basin. Similar to, our GPS data also revealed vertical deformation in the northern Taiwan consistent with the Permanent Scatter Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSInSAR) measurements, which revealed (1) a slight uplift in the Western Foothills, the Tatun volcano group, and the Linkou Tableland; (2) the subsidence around the border of the Taipei Basin.",

            "abstract": "Recently there has been a raft of manuscripts which claim to show that arctic amplification (AA, largely due to increased thermal forcing around the time of the late-summer sea-ice minimum) is responsible for broad changes in the large-scale wintertime mid-latitude atmospheric circulation patterns and could even lead to an increase in extreme weather events. A number of responses to these studies have shown that the results are likely artefacts of the chosen methodology, but do not discount the potential influence of AA on the mid-latitude circulation. Relatively few studies have demonstrated physical mechanisms or physical pathways by which AA may drive a lagged atmospheric response. In this investigation we employ a linear stationary wave model to investigate the hypothesis that AA, in the form of a low-level anomalous heating of the atmosphere, may drive a lagged mid-latitude circulation response. A change in the quasi-stationary wave pattern may be regarded as a necessary though not sufficient condition for any subsequent changes in the frequency, timing or magnitude of extreme events. The low-order model is well suited to the question due to its ability to reproduce the observed atmospheric circulation, and its simplicity – as it requires only four forcing components plus the zonal mean state from reanalysis or a GCM, interpreting the model results is relatively straightforward. An ensemble of simulations are performed with idealized low-level diabatic heatings imposed in regions matching the observed thermal anomaly maxima during the record sea-ice minimum event of 2012. The preliminary results are presented here and we evaluate the atmospheric response of the mid-latitude stationary waves, if any, to the heating and identify the driving mechanisms.",

In the previous work, we have developed a course of workshops on the conservation of biodiversity. To disseminate the course as a tool for environmental education, determination of the educational effect is essential. A text mining enables analyses of frequency and co-occurrence of words in the freely described texts. This study is intended to evaluate the effect of workshop by using text mining technique.\nWe hosted the originally developed workshop on the conservation of biodiversity for 22 college students. The aim of the workshop was to inform the definition of biodiversity. Generally, biodiversity refers to the diversity of ecosystem, diversity between species, and diversity within species. To facilitate discussion, supplementary materials were used. For instance, field guides of wildlife species were used to discuss about the diversity of ecosystem. Moreover, a hierarchical framework in an ecological pyramid was shown for understanding the role of diversity between species. Besides, we offered a document material on the historical affair of Potato Famine in Ireland to discuss about the diversity within species from the genetic viewpoint.\nBefore and after the workshop, we asked students for free description on the definition of biodiversity, and analyzed by using Tiny Text Miner. This technique enables Japanese language morphological analysis. Frequently-used words were sorted into some categories. Moreover, a principle component analysis was carried out.\nAfter the workshop, frequency of the words tagged to diversity between species and diversity within species has significantly increased. From a principle component analysis, the 1st component consists of the words such as producer, consumer, decomposer, and food chain. This indicates that the students have comprehended the close relationship between biodiversity and ecological pyramid. The 2nd component consists of the words such as gene, species, and ecosystem, suggesting that the students have correctly understood the 3 aspects of biodiversity. Consequently, this workshop shows an effect on acquirement of basic knowledge about the biodiversity.",

            "abstract": "Kriging has recently been revived as a powerful tool for predicting the outcome of costly numerical experiments and for guiding simulator evaluations, be it for optimization, inversion, or uncertainty quantification purposes. One key requirement for a successful application of Kriging is to formulate a suitable covariance (or variogram) model reflecting the (dis)similarity between locations or “inputs”, in the sense that two inputs with a high covariance (or a low variogram) value are expected to correspond to close outcomes. Here we present an approach where the inputs can be very high-dimensional, like curves and maps, or even not identifiable as vectors, like shapes or geological scenarios. We extend the Kriging methodology to a very general set-up where a collection of inputs is given together with some measure of similarity between them, the response of interest is known only for a subset of the inputs, and predictions of the response are needed for the remaining inputs. The proposed Similarity Based Kriging (SBK) method relies on the combination of Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) together with some well-chosen class of positive definite kernels. Possible degrees of freedom that govern the similarity measure and the MDS algorithms employed as well as the selected kernel make it a very versatile approach. Provided a relevant (dis)similarity measure between inputs is available, SBK appears as a simple and powerful method for predicting the outcome of complex experiments in a dimension-free set-up. After a global introduction to SBK, we will present results that concern the optimal tuning of MDS and kernel parameters. The potential of SBK for prediction and adaptive experimental design in geosciences will finally be illustrated using data sets from aquifer modelling and beyond.",

Terrestrial bow shock is simulated as an example. 3D Magnetohydrodynamics model ,MHD GUMICS in CCMC project, have been used in parallel with PIC under same scaled Solar wind (SW) and IMF conditions. We report new results from the coupling between the two models. Further investigations are required for confirmations of these results. In both codes the Earth's bow shock position is found at ~14.8 RE along the Sun-Earth line, and ~29 RE on the dusk side which is consistent with past in situ observation. Both simulations reproduce the theoretical jump conditions at the shock. However, PIC code density and temperature distributions are inflated and slightly shifted sunward when compared to MHD results. Reflected ions upstream of the bow shock may cause this sunward shift for density and temperature. Distribution of reflected ions and electrons are shown in the foreshock region, within the transition of the shock and in the downstream. The current version of PIC code can be run under modest computing facilities and resources. Additionally, existing MHD simulations should be useful to calibrate scaled properties of plasma resulting from PIC simulations for comparison with observations. Similarities and drawbacks of the results obtained by the two models are listed. The ultimate goal of using these different models in a complimentary manner rather than competitive is to better understand the macrostructure of the magnetosphere",

            "abstract": "The 2011 Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami reminded that nature can exceed structural countermeasures like seawalls, breakwaters or tsunami gates. In such situations it is a challenging task for people to find nearby haven. This event, as many others before, confirmed the importance of early evacuation, tsunami awareness and the need for developing much more resilient communities with effective evacuation plans. To support reconstruction activities and efforts on developing resilient communities in areas at risk, tsunami evacuation simulation can be applied to tsunami mitigation and evacuation planning. In this study, using the compiled information related to the evacuation behavior at Yuriage in Natori during the 2011 tsunami, we simulated the evacuation process and explored the reasons for the large number of fatalities in the area. It was found that residents did evacuate to nearby shelter areas, however after the tsunami warning was increased some evacuees decided to conduct a second step evacuation to a far inland shelter. Simulation results show the consequences of such decision and the outcomes when a second evacuation would not have been performed. The actual reported number of fatalities in the event and the results from simulation are compared to verify the model. The case study shows the contribution of tsunami evacuation models as tools to be applied for the analysis of evacuees’ decisions and the related outcomes. In addition, future evacuation plans and activities for reconstruction process and urban planning can be supported by the results provided from this kind of tsunami evacuation models.",

This entirely open source software project will integrate various seismic processing utilities with the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office's core software, AWIPS2.\n\nFor the real-time and near real-time seismic processing aspect of this project, NOAA has elected to integrate the open source portions of GFZ's SeisComP 3 (SC3) processing system into AWIPS2. To provide for better tsunami threat assessments we are developing open source tools for magnitude estimations (e.g., moment magnitude, energy magnitude, surface wave magnitude), detection of slow earthquakes with the Theta discriminant, moment tensor inversions (e.g. W-phase and teleseismic body waves), finite fault inversions, and array processing.\n\nWith our reliance on common data formats such as QuakeML and seismic community standard messaging systems, all new facilities introduced into AWIPS2 and SC3 will be available as stand-alone tools or could be easily integrated into other real time seismic monitoring systems such as Earthworm, Antelope, etc. Additionally, we have developed a template based design paradigm so that the developer or scientist can efficiently create upgrades, replacements, and/or new metrics to the seismic data processing with only a cursory knowledge of the underlying SC3.",

            "abstract": "The objectives of NASA’s ASCENDS mission are to improve the knowledge of global CO2 sources and sinks by precisely measuring the tropospheric column abundance of atmospheric CO2 and O2. The mission will use a continuously operating nadir-pointed integrated path differential absorption (IPDA) lidar in a polar orbit. The lidar offers a number of important new capabilities and will measure atmospheric CO2 globally over a wide range of challenging conditions, including at night, at high latitudes, through hazy and thin cloud conditions, and to cloud tops. The laser source enables a measurement of range, so that the absorption path length to the scattering surface will be always accurately known. The lidar approach also measures consistently in a nadir-zenith path and the narrow laser linewidth allows weighting the measurement to the lower troposphere. Using these measurements with atmospheric and flux models will allow improved estimates of CO2 fluxes and hence better understanding of the processes that exchange CO2 between the surface and atmosphere.\nThe ASCENDS formulation team has developed a preliminary set of requirements for the lidar measurements. These were developed based on experience gained from the numerous ASCENDS airborne campaigns that have used different candidate lidar measurement techniques. They also take into account the complexity of making precise measurement of atmospheric gas columns when viewing the Earth from space. Some of the complicating factors are the widely varying reflectance and topographic heights of the Earth’s land and ocean surfaces, the variety of cloud types, and the degree of cloud and aerosol absorption and scattering in the atmosphere.\nThe requirements address the precision and bias in the measured column mixing ratio, the dynamic range of the expected surface reflected signal, the along-track sampling resolution, measurements made through thin clouds, measurements to forested and slope surfaces, range precision, measurements to cloud tops, knowledge of the laser spot position, and off-nadir pointing. These requirements are independent of the measurement approach, and are consistent with the initial mission simulation studies performed by the formulation team. This presentation will summarize the requirements along with examples that have guided their selection.",

            "abstract": "Repeating earthquake sequences on the plate subduction zone represent the slip-rate histories around their fault patches. So they are useful resources for monitoring precursory aseismic slip of major earthquakes on plate boundaries. Repeating earthquakes are often modeled by renewal processes, point processes whose recurrence intervals are independent and identically distributed. However, their repeating intervals are greatly influenced by larger seismic events or aseismic slow slip, and hence we need to model such non-stationary behavior of repeating earthquakes. In this study, we propose a non-stationary space-time model for repeating earthquakes based on the model in Nomura et al. (2014) applied to the Parkfield catalog. We used the empirical relation between magnitudes and slip sizes of repeating earthquakes by Nadeau and Johnson (1998) to estimate the slip-rate histories in repeating sequences. The proposed model can estimate spatio-temporal variation in slip rate with smoothness restriction adjusted to optimize its Bayesian likelihood.\nWe apply the proposed model to the large catalog of repeating earthquakes in Uchida and Matsuzawa (2013) on subduction zone of Pacific Plate in the northeastern Japan from 1993 to 2011 and estimate slip-rate history of the plate boundary. From this analysis, we discuss the characteristic changes in slip rate before and after the major earthquakes such as Sanriku-Haruka-Oki (1994 Mw7.6), Tokachi-Oki (2003 Mw8.0), Kushiro-Oki (2004 Mw7.1), Fukushima-Oki (2008 Mw6.9), Ibaraki-Oki (2008 Mw7.0) and Tohoku-Oki (2011 Mw9.0).",

            "abstract": "The Water Framework Directive 60/2000/EC requires European Union member states to ensure good status of water bodies. To this end, it requires to identify relevant pressures (e.g. diffuse pollution) on waters, to address them through appropriate measures (e.g. enforce good agricultural practices), and to report both pressures and measures to the European Commission (EC). In spite of existing assessment guidance, member states report about pressures in a rather heterogeneous way. This has stimulated the EC to undertake a comparison between the pressures reported by the member states with those depicted by Europe-wide model-based indicators. This alone has required turning model results to communicable maps to be used in a decision making context with minimal risk of interpretive distortion. The comparison suggests that the identification of relevant pressures at the continental scale is not always the same as at the national and regional scale, causing difficulties in the prioritization of investments and doubts about the effectiveness of envisaged measures. A simple rank-based classification has been used to map the level of agreement between pressures reported by the member states and the corresponding European indicators, highlighting regions where a more detailed insight is required in order to come to a shared judgment on pressures hampering the achievement of good water body status. Reported pressures may suffer from incompleteness and semantic uncertainty, while European indicators suffer from model uncertainties and errors. A discussion of differences between European indicators and river basin assessments in the light of agreed-upon reporting and model limitations may help to collaboratively improve the assessment from both sides, and consequently to design more effectively the measures to be implemented at the respective levels. We present and discuss the case study, highlighting how the approach may be useful in contexts of transnational water management.",

            "abstract": "In Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) inverse modeling, the usual assumption for the mantle rheology is the Maxwell model, which exhibits constant viscosity over time. However, mineral physics experiments and post-seismic observations show evidence of a transient component in the deformation of the shallow mantle, with a short-term viscosity lower than the long-term one. In these studies, the resulting rheology is modeled by a Burgers material: such rheology is indeed expected as the mantle is a mixture of materials with different viscosities.\nWe propose to apply this rheology for the whole viscoelastic mantle, and, using a Bayesian MCMC inverse formalism for GIA during the last glacial cycle, study its impact on estimations of viscosity values, elastic thickness of the lithosphere, and ice distribution. To perform this inversion, we use a global dataset of sea level records, the geological constraints of ice-sheet margins, and present-day GPS data as well as satellite gravimetry.\nOur ambition is to present not only the best fitting model, but also the range of possible solutions (within the explored space of parameters) with their respective probability of explaining the data. Our first results indicate that compared to the Maxwell models, the Burgers models involve a larger lower mantle viscosity and thicker ice over Fennoscandia and Canada.",

            "abstract": "The raindrop size distribution (DSD) is crucial information on the structure of rainfall. All bulk rainfall variables of interest can be derived as weighted moments of the DSD. Usually the DSD is measured at point locations using disdrometers. In some contexts, such as the investigation of scale-change effects, it would be useful to be able to interpolate the DSD across space between point measurements. Traditionally such studies are performed by interpolating bulk variables individually. Such an approach fails to take into account any interrelationships between the bulk variables and information is lost.\nWe present a spatial interpolation method for the whole drop size distribution. Instead of using multivariate geostatistics, we use a principle component analysis (PCA) to identify orthogonal components of the DSD. These components are independent, and thus we can apply univariate geostatistics to each one individually. Interpolation is carried out using ordinary kriging. Once components are interpolated, the interpolation of the DSD can be recovered at any requested point by recombining and back-transforming the components. The advantages of the method are that the DSD is interpolated in full, the use of PCA allows us to control and quantify the amount of information loss that occurs, and relationships between any bulk variables are maintained through the process. An important feature of rainfall that is considered in the proposed interpolation method is the intermittency and its influence on the spatial distribution of raindrops.\nWe have applied this technique to DSDs recorded at point locations in a GPM-pixel sized area in Ardèche, France in the framework of the HyMeX project. To test the results we use leave-one-out testing and compare to interpolation of individual bulk variables; the results are favourable. An investigation of the radar reflectivity to rain-rate (Z-R) relationship shows that our DSD interpolation technique maintains the relationships between bulk variables. The technique will be useful for investigation of DSD variability and the effects of scale-change over space, which in turn will be beneficial to DSD model verification.",

Soil moisture participates in the energy cycle by managing the partitioning of the energy budget into latent and sensible heat, there by influencing the hydrological cycle. But to better understand the influence of soil moisture on the hydrological cycle, large scale monitoring is required. The objective of this study is to qualitatively analyze the active-passive merged soil moisture distribution, prepared under the ESA_CCI programme, against two AMSR-E soil moisture distributions, AMSR-E/NSIDC (National Snow and Ice Data Center) and AMSR-E/VUA(Virje Universiet Amstradam) and GLDAS_NOAH model simulations. The ESA_CCI soil moisture distribution is also compared with the GPCC monthly precipitation distribution to observe the representativeness of the precipitation seasonality in the satellite retrieved soil moisture. India has been selected as the study area, esp. the Central Indian region, as it has shown to be a soil moisture hot-spot for land-surface atmosphere interaction. The preliminary study show that both ESA_CCI and AMSR-E/VUA soil moisture distributions capture similar seasonal patterns in addition to processes like rainfall events and inter-annual variations. In addition to this it was also observed that the soil moisture distribution of ESA_CCI and AMSR-E/VUA are linearly related to each other for more than 50% of the land points. In case of ESA_CCI and AMSR-E/NSIDC, the soil moisture distributions are able to capture similar seasonal patterns but not the random events and they also do not show a strong linear relationship. We also analyze the effect of topography and vegetation distribution on the error charactristics of the satellite retrieved soil moisture distributions.",

            "abstract": "The Mentawai patch is a 700-km long section of the Sunda megathrust, where great earthquakes commonly rupture most or all of the patch in decade-long sequences, every two centuries or so. In 2007, the patch sustained partial rupture during a Mw 8.4 earthquake. Several aftershocks failed in the Mw 7.0 to 7.8 range on the parts of the patch peripheral to the 2007 mainshock. However, the events released far less energy than expected, thus we anticipate other great earthquakes in the next few decades. We examine the kinematic details of one large aftershock, a Mw 7.2 earthquake in 2008. This event has not previously been studied due to its relatively low magnitude compared to other recent studies. Using daily solutions for nine continuous GPS stations, we estimated a coseismic slip distribution for the event. We then used 2.75-years of cumulative displacements for four GPS stations to model afterslip, both kinematically and dynamically in the framework of rate-and-state friction laws. Our preliminary results show that peak coseismic slip of ~2 m is concentrated under North Pagai Island. The modeled afterslip concentrates up- and down-dip of the estimated coseismic slip patch. The fact that this moderate size event did not cascade into the much larger event that has been forecast, and instead generated significant afterslip in surrounding areas of the fault, illustrates the potential of the megathrust to generate a spectrum of earthquake sizes. Their sizes are likely controlled by lateral segmentation and structural barriers on the fault.",

            "abstract": "Gas flaring is a global environmental hazard severely impacting climate, economy and public health. The associated emissions are frequently unreported and have large uncertainties. Prior studies have established a direct relationship between radiative energy released from fires and the biomass burned, making fire radiative power (FRP), i.e., the rate of radiative energy release, an important proxy to characterize emissions. In this study fire properties from four different satellite products were obtained over a 10⁰ x 10⁰ gas flaring region in Russia for all days of May 2013. The target area is part of Russia’s biggest gas flaring region, Khanty-Mansiysk autonomous okrug. The objective of the study is to investigate the consistency of fire detections, FRP retrievals and effects of gridding FRP data from the region on a uniform grid. The four products used were: MODIS Terra level2 thermal anomalies (MOD14), MODIS Aqua level2 thermal anomalies (MYD14), VIIRS Active fire product and a recent NOAA Nightfire product. 1 km nominal resolution FRP from MOD14 AND MYD14, subpixel radiant heat (RH) from NOAA Nightfire product and fire detections from all four products were recorded on a 0.25⁰ x 0.25⁰ grid on a daily basis. Results revealed the Nightfire product had maximum detections, almost six times the number of detections by other products, mainly because of the use of M10 (1.6 µm) band as their primary detection band. The M10 band is highly efficient in identifying radiant emissions from hot sources during night-time. The correlation (after omitting outliers) between gridded NOAA Nightfire RH and corresponding MOD14 FRP and MYD14 FRP gave a moderate regression value, with MODIS FRP being mostly higher than RH. As an extension to this work, a comprehensive study for a larger temporal domain also incorporating viewing geometries and cloud cover would advance our understanding of flare detections and associated FRP retrievals not just for the target region but also gas flaring regions globally.",

            "abstract": "Previous studies of the observation show that the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) tends to be modulated according to the 11-year solar cycle. In fact, late-winter SAM signal in the lower troposphere tends to be extended to the upper stratosphere and persist until the following summer in the solar-max years, whereas it is mostly restricted in the troposphere and disappears quickly in the solar-minyears.\nTo examine the source of such solar cycle modulation of the SAM, three sets of 42-year runs of our chemistry-climate model had been performed. The only difference of these three runs is a small realistic change of the ultra-violet (UV) radiation.\nOur model satisfactorily simulates the solar cycle modulation of the SAM signal; the stratosphere-troposphere coupling tends to be stronger with the increase of the UV. The result suggests that the source of observed solar cycle modulation comes from UV change.\nTo examine how the solar cycle modulation occurs with small change of the UV, lagged regression analysis is performed based on the dominant SVD mode of zonal-mean wind and vertical component of E-P flux on October for each run. We found that although signals of zonal wind and E-P flux are very similar in October, they develop to very different states according to the UV strength. In fact, clear downward propagation of stratospheric SAM signal to the troposphere is found on December in stronger UV run, but such downward signal is very unclear for weaker UV run. Analysis of wave propagation/forcing shows that such difference of downward propagation of stratospheric signal originates mostly from the wave propagation in the troposphere. In fact, wave propagation tends to more enhanced toward the tropical troposphere in stronger UV run, but vertical propagation is more enhanced for weaker UV run. Possible scenario of solar cycle modulation of SAM signal is discussed.",

The instrument is downward looking, and will acquire an imaging sequence during the descent to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko with a sampling ranging from about 20 cm/pix to 1 cm/pix. After landing, the imager will operate in close-up mode, which will enable it to acquire multi-color close-up images of the surface below the lander with a sampling of 0.3 mm/pix. With its capabilities, ROLIS will bridge the resolution gap between the orbiter imager OSIRIS and the CIVA IR-microscope on Philae. The aim of the experiment is to contribute to the understanding of the physical properties of the surface, as its texture, photometric properties, degree of heterogeneity, as well as the processes at work, as erosion by sublimation and collisions that reshape the nucleus over time. The measurements by ROLIS will also provide context to the Philae in-situ analyzers, while the landing acquisition sequence will contribute to an accurate determination of the landing location. This paper will discuss the first results from the ROLIS experiment, with emphasis on the geomorphology of the surface of the nucleus at decameter to cm scales.",

Little is known on the relative sensitivity of evaporation models to variables and parameters, and insights into the acceptable error in required data forcing are required for both terrestrial and spaceborne applications. This study focuses on evaluating the impact of uncertainties in input data for a number of commonly used evaporation models, including SEBS, PT-JPL and PM-Mu. High-quality records from a set of FLUXNET towers over various biomes were used to provide a semi-synthetic dataset of consistent meteorological and flux observations, accompanied with MODIS observations of vegetation phenology. The input meteorological data to the models were contaminated with a defined error structure and used to force the evaporation models. Subsequent variations in the simulated evaporation were observed by comparison against tower data. Diagnosis of the impact of forcing data accuracy was aided by tracing back the range in the perturbed input errors for a given prediction error in evaporation. Frequency analysis on the range of data errors from the previous step for a large ensemble of modeling records provided insights on the sensitivity of the models to data and the needed accuracy of the input data required for accurate evaporation modeling.",

            "abstract": "The sequence of 4 large earthquakes of magnitude 8 and more, which occurred in Mongolia and its border during the XX century, is unique in the world. Starting in 1905 July 7 by the Tsetserleg earthquake of Mw≈8, it was followed by the great Bolnay earthquake the 1905 July 23 Mw≈8.4, the FuYun earthquake the 1931 August 10 Mw≈8, and the Bogd (Gobi-Altay) earthquake the 1957 December 4 Mw≈8.1. The seismicity recorded since 1964 by the RCAG (Research Center of Astronomy and Geophysics, Mongolia) is concentrated, still up to now, along the large surfaces ruptures induced by theses four events with a cumulative length of more than 1000 km. We do not observe such high seismicity along the other active faults in the region that produced similar large events several centuries ago. The recurrence period estimated of these large earthquakes is more than 3000 years related to the low deformation rate along the faults (estimated between 1 to 3 mm/year). Thus, an important part of the observed seismicity is related to “late aftershocks”.\nDespite the seismic network started to cover Mongolia only by 1964, it covers a period allowing us to reconstruct one century of aftershocks decay by combining these 4 events of “similar” magnitude. The completeness magnitude of the catalog is considered over various periods. Yet, the area of the 1905 events has a more complex aftershocks behavior probably due to the proximity of the Hovsgol extension basin at the north and the close location of the two 1905 events (the rupture of the Bolnay event touches the ones of the Tsetserleg). We show the very long duration of aftershocks related to such great intracontinental earthquakes. Therefore, the hazard assessment in such context should include the aftershocks as a characteristic of the area.",

            "abstract": "Quantitative estimates of the composition of the Late Archean atmosphere are integral to deciphering the drivers of planetary oxygenation in the early Paleoproterozoic. However, the majority of geochemical proxies from marine sediments only inform on planetary redox via inference, making direct constraints on the ancient atmosphere difficult to place. Fortunately, the quadruple S-isotope (QSI) record (δ34S, Δ33S, and Δ36S) is implicitly tied to the composition of the ancient atmosphere.\nWe have generated coupled QSI and δ13COrg records from two cores through the Transvaal basin in South Africa (GKF01 and BH1-Sacha) and from three time-equivalent cores through the Hammersley basin in Western Australia. These records reveal similar, apparently synchronous, co-variation between deviations from “typical” Neoarchean Δ36S/Δ33S values and negative δ13COrg values (C-S anomalies). We have interpreted these trends to reflect increased incorporation of 13C-depleted substrates (methane) into sedimentary matter following apparently episodically enhanced methanogenesis in the prelude to the GOE. These records suggest the terminal Neoarchean atmosphere operated in a bi-stable fashion, oscillating between a clear skies and organic-rich hazy state (Zerkle et al., 2010; Izon et al., in review).\nWe speculate that these C-S anomalies reflect enhanced nutrient availability, facilitating the proliferation of an oxygenic photosynthetic/methanogenic biosphere, concomitantly amplifying biogenic CH4 and O2 fluxes and altering atmospheric chemistry. Here we present a new S- and C-isotope data set, derived at unprecedented resolution, encompassing the youngest C-S anomaly identified in core GKF01. These analyses will be combined with Fe-speciation and trace-metal data to elucidate whether atmospheric methane levels were regulated by climatically driven changes in nutrient fluxes to the marine biosphere. Taken together, our research serves as an initial foray to determine how, and why, the early Earth redox balance shifted, initiating oxygenation and ultimately spawning a habitable planet capable of supporting macroscopic life.",

            "abstract": "Recent efforts have sought to estimate river discharge and other surface water related quantities using spaceborne sensors, with better spatial coverage but worse temporal sampling as compared with in situ measurements. The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission will provide river discharge estimates globally from space. However, questions on how to optimally use the spatially distributed but asynchronous satellite observations to generate continuous fields still exist. This paper presents a statistical model (River Kriging-RK), for estimating discharge time series in a river network in the context of the SWOT mission. RK uses discharge estimates at different locations and times to produce a continuous field using spatiotemporal kriging. A key component of RK is the space-time river discharge covariance, which was derived analytically from the diffusive wave approximation of Saint-Venant’s equations. The RK covariance also accounts for the loss of correlation at confluences. The model performed well in a case study on Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) River system in Bangladesh using synthetic SWOT observations. The correlation model reproduced empirically-derived values. RK (R2=0.83) outperformed other kriging-based methods (R2=0.80), as well as a simple time series linear interpolation (R2=0.72). RK was used to combine discharge from SWOT and in situ observations, improving estimates when the latter is included (R2=0.91). The proposed statistical concepts may eventually provide a feasible framework to estimate continuous discharge time series across a river network based on SWOT data, other altimetry missions and/or in situ data.",

Optimizing the treatment is vital for the economic and sustainable development of hydrocarbon reservoir and for the minimization of potential environmental impacts. The analysis of the induced seismicity and of event parameters provide an estimate of the effect of the treatment and the extent of the changes in the rock reservoir properties affecting fluid conductivity. This gives critical feedback for the optimization of the treatment, especially during real-time monitoring. In this study, we correlate microseismic attributes such as the fracture dimensions, event distribution and b-values with the fluid treatment parameters such as the pumping pressure and the slurry rate across different reservoir treatments. Although the microseismic attributes are influenced by many different factors such as the reservoir elastic properties, the stress regime and in-situ fracturing, we consistently observed positive correlations between the slurry rate, plateau treatment pressure and the fracture dimensions. In addition, the variation and systematic deviation of b-value from the natural average of 1.0 gives an insight into the geomechanical behavior of the reservoir. Similar to b-value, another fractal dimension, D-value, indicates the fracture spatial propagation from linear advancement (D=1.0) to planar distribution (D=2.0) to full space occurrence (D=3.0). By merging microseismic events from multiple treatment stages, we statistically analyzed magnitude distribution and spatial and temporal structure of the microseismic cloud induced during the stimulation of a range of different reservoirs with a total population of ~20,000 MS events. Analysis on multiple treatment projects can provide a first order guidance on selecting optimal treatment parameters.",

            "abstract": "Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi remains one of the most useful benthic species in paleoceanographic studies due to its epibenthic lifestyle and use in geochemical studies. However, misconceptions exist about this important taxon. Genetic comparisons with Genbank have shown that C. wuellerstorfi living in the Pacific are the same species as those in the North Atlantic, and the Antarctic. Sediment cores taken on a transect through the Southern California Bight oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) have shown that C. wuellerstorfi make up as much as 11.2% of the stained population despite oxygen-poor conditions (0.47-0.63 mL/L with water depths ranging from 360-3000m). Living C. wuellerstorfi has also been found to inhabit many areas of methane seepage with available oxygen levels as low as 0.23mL/L. Colonization of experimental substrates at Hydrate Ridge revealed substantial colonization within 12 months (~1,000 individuals/~5,000cm3) and preference between substrate materials (e.g. abundance on plastic and absence on adjacent wood). As in other seep studies; stable carbon isotopic values of C. wuellerstorfi of Hydrate Ridge seeps exhibit a wider range than their non-seep counterparts. Stable carbon isotopes at Hydrate Ridge were significantly different between seep and non-seep locations despite having an overlapping range. Changes in seep fluid characteristics (e.g. temperature and composition) are evidently recorded in the δ18O of benthic foraminiferal calcite at methane seeps and hydrothermal seeps in the Pacific. The use of δ18O of benthic foraminiferal calcite may hold promise as a valuable means to assess seep characteristics, especially in recognizing and evaluating hydrothermal seeps.\nThese results have significant implications for the cosmopolitan distribution, ecophenotypic variation, and genetic exchange of C. wuellerstorfi. The prevalence of C. wuellerstorfi in areas of low oxygen availability shows that this species is able to thrive in oxygen-poor habitats, and provides strong evidence that this taxon is not a reliable indicator of oxygen rich environments. Geochemical results suggest that there is a relationship between seeping fluids and foraminiferal calcite geochemistry and implying that novel geochemical relationships should be further explored at cold and hydrothermal seeps.",

            "abstract": "There is a growing literature on climate change w.r.t. severe changes in extreme events related to the Monsoon rainfall over India. Evidence of increasing spatial variability of extreme rainfall triggers several aspects such as: how are the spatially homogeneous regions or clusters changing w.r.t. extreme rainfall over time? Is there detectable evidences of changes in cluster behavior? Can we arrive at a forecast? Purpose of this study is twofold: firstly, we introduce a novel discrete-time finite state-space hidden Markov models with non-constant transition matrix depending on a set of exogenous covariates including cluster level temporal information. We present a space-time varying dynamic with conditionally independent Generalized Extreme value (GEV) distribution as modeling extremes. Secondly, we introduce a model based spatio-temporal clustering algorithm based on the latter model. We illustrate this technique based on Monsoon rainfall data and show that the cluster characteristics are significantly changing along with the number of clusters. We also obtain one step ahead future patterns of the clusters.",

            "abstract": "HO2 is closely coupled with OH which is responsible for the majority of the oxidation in the troposphere. Therefore, it is important to be able to accurately predict OH and HO2 concentrations. However, many studies have reported a large discrepancy between HO2 radical concentrations measured during field campaigns and predicted by constrained box models using detailed chemical mechanisms (1,2). However, there have been very few laboratory studies (3,4) on HO2 uptake by aerosols and the rates and mechanism is still uncertain.\nThe HO2 uptake coefficients were measured for deliquesced ammonium nitrate and sodium chloride aerosols and copper doped sucrose aerosols. The measurements were performed using an aerosol flow tube coupled to a Fluorescence Assay by Gas Expansion (FAGE) detector. By either placing the HO2 injector in set positions and varying the aerosol concentration or by moving it along the flow tube at given aerosol concentrations, uptake coefficients could be measured. The aerosols were generated using an atomiser and the total aerosol surface area was measured using a SMPS.\nLarger uptake coefficients were measured at shorter times and lower HO2 concentrations for aqueous salt aerosols. The time dependence was able to be modelled by the KM-SUB model (5) as the HO2 concentration decreases along the flow tube and the HO2 uptake mechanism is known to be a second order reaction. Measurements have shown that at higher HO2 concentrations there was also more H2O2 exiting the injector which could convert back to HO2 if trace amounts of metals are present within the aerosol via Fenton reactions. Preliminary results have shown that the inclusion of a Fenton-like reaction within the KM-SUB model has the potential to explain the apparent HO2 concentration dependence. Finally, the KM-SUB model has been used to demonstrate that the increase in uptake coefficient observed when increasing the relative humidity for copper doped sucrose aerosols could be explained by an increase in the diffusion coefficient of HO2 in the aerosol.\n(1) Sommariva, R. et al.

            "abstract": "Continental margins are rarely straight, resulting in oblique sections of transpression or transtension. Two orogens that contain such oblique elements, the Pan-African Araçuai-Ribeira belt and the Caledonian orogen, are here discussed and compared. While the Scandinavian Caledonides are a relatively cool orogen owing to rapid subduction and quick subsequent exhumation, the Brazilian example is much hotter (>750 °C), with widespread partial melting (>30% melt volume). This makes for an interesting comparison both with respect to orogen-perpendicular and oblique convergence and divergence.\nIn general, the northern section of the Araçuai-Ribeira belt in Brazil (the N-S oriented Araçuaí part) experienced more or less margin-perpendicular contraction, while the NE-SW oriented southern (Ribeira) section was strongly influenced by dextral transpression. The transpressive Ribeira section has a ~150 km wide network of transcurrent shear zones. A possible analog to this zone is the Møre-Trøndelag shear zone in the Caledonides, which also defines a marked regional change in the trend of the orogen. This shear zone is located in the hottest (>650 °C) part of the Scandinavian Caledonides, but has a width of only ~50 km. While several factors may have an influence on this difference in width between the laterally sheared Ribeira belt and the Møre-Trøndelag shear zone, we suspect that the cooler and therefore more rigid nature of the Caledonides may have imposed an important rheologic control on the way that strain is distributed in the middle crust. This goes for the contractional phase, but also for the postcollisional transtensional phase during which multiple crustal-scale shear zones formed or reactivated in the Caledonides. Caledonian extension/transtension structures involve extensive reactivation of Caledonian thrusts, but also formation of new extensional shear zones and faults. Hence the fact that post-collisional transtension/extension structures are better defined and more localized in the Caledonides than in the Araçuai-Ribeira belt may relate to the temperature difference between the two orogens.",

            "abstract": "A new paleobiological proxy for Antarctic paleoclimate history provides insight into past extent of open marine shelves on Wilkes Land margin, and calls for reassessment of IRD interpretations in the deep-sea. Marine, epiphytic benthic diatoms that grow attached to macroalgae (seaweed) are recovered in Miocene sediment from DSDP Site 269. They suggest periodic presence of floating rafts or ‘biotic oases’ in the Southern Ocean comprising buoyant macroalgae, attached benthic diatoms, and biota associated with this displaced coastal community. Macroalgae attach to the substrate with a holdfast, a multi-fingered structure that serves as an anchor. Uprooted holdfasts attached to buoyant macroalgae can raft sedimentary particles, some large (>50 kg), into the deep-sea. In addition, a rich biota of associated invertebrates live in cavities within the holdfast, the dispersal of which may explain the biogeographic distribution of organisms on Subantarctic islands. The stratigraphic occurrence of large, benthic epiphytic diatoms of genera Arachnoidiscus, Isthmia, Rhabdonema, Gephyra, Trigonium, and smaller Achnanthes, Cocconeis, Grammatophora, and Rhaphoneis in sediment cores from DSDP Site 269 reflect a rich, productive epiphytic diatom flora that maintained its position in the photic zone attached to their buoyant seaweed hosts. Amphipods and other herbivores grazed the benthic diatoms and produced diatom-rich fecal pellets that were delivered to the sea-floor. The discontinuous stratigraphic occurrence of the epiphytic diatoms, amongst the background of planktonic diatoms in Core 9 of DSDP Site 269, suggests environmental changes induced by either warm or cold events may have controlled the production and/or release of the macroalgae into the deep-sea. Warm events led to increased shelf areas, and cold events led to formation of ice on the macroalgae to increase their buoyancy and lift-off. Complicating the distinction between warm and cold events is the potential for the transport of sediment within the holdfast, biologically-rafted-debris (BRD). Identifying the abundance and provenance of the terrigeneous sediment may help to distinguish the climate and source-area signal of this complex relationship and refine the use of epiphytic diatoms as a paleoclimate and stratigraphic tool.",

            "abstract": "Several geothermal energy production fields are currently harnessed in Iceland. One of these is located at the Hengill triple junction, where the oblique plate motion along the Reykjanes peninsula is partitioned between the E-W oriented transform along the South Iceland Seismic Zone (SISZ) and spreading across the Western Volcanic Zone in SW Iceland. The Hengill volcano has high temperature geothermal areas utilized by the Hellisheiði and Nesjavellir power plants. The region around the power plants is subject to motion and deformation of the Earth's surface due to several processes. These include the motion of the Earth's crust due to plate spreading, co- and post seismic deformation due to earthquakes in the South Iceland Seismic Zone and deformation due to water and steam extraction and wastewater re-injection near geothermal power plants. We measure surface displacement using both GPS and InSAR data. The former are obtained from four continuous and more than 15 campaign GPS stations, with time-series starting after two M6 earthquakes on 29 May 2008 in Ölfus - the western most part of the SISZ. The InSAR data consist of 10 images taken on track 41 of the TerraSar-X mission, starting October 2009. We can see a clear subsidence signal in the proximity of the power plants with a maximum of ~18 mm/yr in Line-of-Sight direction (LOS) at Hellisheiði. The subsidence is elongated in NNE-SSW direction and possibly related to the orientation of the Hengill fissure swarm. In addition to subsidence, we observe an uplift signal of ca. 10 mm/yr in LOS west of the Hellisheiði site, potentially due to wastewater re-injection in the area. The area of maximum uplift is located close to the epicenters of two M4 earthquakes that occurred in October 2011. Since the signal around the power plants is the most prominent, we start our investigation with trying to find an appropriate model for deformation due to fluid extraction and re-injection with the aim of simulating the data. By doing so, we hope to learn more about parameters that we don't have a priori knowledge about, e.g. hydraulic conductivity and elastic properties of the crust. Furthermore, we hope to gain a better understanding of what are the key mechanisms that drive crustal deformation in areas of geothermal energy production.",

            "abstract": "The light-use efficiency (LUE, ε) is one of critical parameters in the terrestrial ecosystem production studies. However, it is still a challenge how to up-scale LUE from canopy to the landscape/regional scales. One potential solution is to use automated multi-angle tower-based remote sensing platforms, which observe canopy reflectance with high spatial, temporal, spectral and angle resolution. Although some published paper on the LUE in boreal and temperate forests had used continuous multi-angle measurements of the surface reflectance, lack of study in literature investigated the vegetation physiological parameters of cropland using the surface reflectance with high spatio-temporal and high spectral data with multiple angles. To improve our understanding of physiological status of cropland, the maize within the footprint of the Daman Superstation flux tower site of Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experiment Research (HiWATER) was employed in this study. Based on the observed reflectance and flux data, a Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) of vegetation index (Photochemical Reflectance Index, PRI and Vegetation Index using the Universal Pattern Decomposition method, VIUPD) at continuous time series was established by integrating of a semi-empirical kernel-driven BRDF model (RossThick-LiSparse), a footprint model (the Simple Analytical Footprint model on Eulerian coordinates for scalar Flux, SAFE-f) and a LUE model. Besides, based on the sky-condition (direct/diffused radiation) data, the relationships between the vegetation index (PRI and VIUPD) and sunlit/shaded LUE under corresponding sky conditions were established. Taking maize field as an example, the measurements were obtained during June to August, 2012. The relationships between PRI and ε for sunlit and shaded leaves were: PRIsu=0.06339×log(εsu) + 0.04882，PRIsh= 0.02675×log(εsh) + 0.01619, where, the subscript su, sh represent sunlit and shaded leaves respectively; p< 0.0001, R2 (Coefficient of determination) equal 0.6443 and 0.6081 for sunlit and shaded, respectively. Then the LUE was up-scaled to landscape/regional scales based on these relationships and sky conditions, and it can be used for the estimation of gross primary productivity (GPP) of cropland using a LUE-based model with high accuracy.",

            "abstract": "The transformation of swell waves from deep water across reef flats is the primary process regulating energy regimes in coral reef systems. The geomorphic evolution of a coral reef is dependent on this process, yet there have been comparatively few studies focusing on wave processes on coral reefs when compared to siliciclastic settings. Of these studies none have recorded storm wave propagation across reef flats. This is a significant oversight since major geomorphic change occurs during storm events with some studies considering coral reefs as event based systems that are primarily driven by high intensity stochastic events such as cyclones or storms. This study focuses on the transformation of swell waves generated by Tropical Cyclone Dylan (storm conditions, January 2014) across the windward reef flats in comparison to data collected during modal fair weather conditions (modal conditions). As such the data sets used in this study are novel due to the difficulty of accessing remote reef sites during storm events. Wave height on the reef flat was similar during modal and storm conditions with wave height primarily controlled by water depth. However, during storm conditions greater wave energy - particularly long period wave energy - and wave generated current velocity was observed despite the regulatory effects of water depth over the reef flat. The potential for sediment and coral rubble transport was much greater during storm conditions with limited sediment transport during modal conditions. This suggests that high frequency storm events are crucial processes driving sediment dynamics in coral reef systems.",

            "abstract": "In this study, a new Climate Extremes Index (CEI) is introduced, extending the earlier combined CEI proposed by Karl et al. (1996). It is based on the use of standard extreme indices derived from daily meteorological station data, facilitating the computation of this index and making use of two global gridded extreme indices datasets. The index combines the fraction of area experiencing extreme conditions in daily temperature and daily and annual precipitation, therefore representing a combined measure of extremes. The analysis of this index at the global scale is limited by data availability. In this study, the four continental-scale regions analysed are Europe, North America, Asia and Australia over the period from 1951 to 2010. Additionally, the index is also computed for the entire Northern Hemisphere, corresponding to the first CEI results at the hemispheric scale. Results show statistically significant increases in the percentage area experiencing much above average warm days and nights and much below average cool days and nights for all regions, with the exception of North America for maximum temperature extremes. Increases in the area affected by precipitation extremes are also found for the Northern Hemisphere regions, particularly Europe. This study shows the potential of this new index for climate monitoring and other applications by documenting large-scale changes in the areas experiencing climate extremes. Preliminary detection and attribution results will also be presented using extreme indices computed for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 climate model simulations (Sillmann et al., 2013).\nKarl, T.

            "abstract": "The instruments onboard the Terra spacecraft were designed for long-term Earth science research but not long after launch it became apparent that this data and imagery could be made available in near real-time for applications users. During the year 2000 fire season in the western United States, the US Forest Service approached NASA with a request to expedite MODIS fire detections. The Rapid Response system was created to generate fire detections as well as true color imagery in both swath and geo-referenced formats. This imagery was used by a wide variety of applications, such as NASA’s AERONET program, the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service, Antarctic resupply shipping, flood mapping for relief agencies, Deepwater Horizon monitoring, volcanic ash monitoring, as well as print, televised, and Internet media. From 2004, the University of Maryland’s Web Fire Mapper helped distribute fire detection information in a variety of formats. However, the applications community expressed the need for near-real time access to the underlying data. This requirement led to the development of the Land Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS (Earth Observing System) (LANCE) in 2009. To achieve the latency requirements, many components of the EOS satellite operations, ground and science processing systems had to be made more efficient. In addition, products that require ancillary data were modified to use alternate inputs. Forty Terra MODIS data products are currently available from LANCE. LANCE also includes data from other instruments including AIRS, AMSR-E, MLS, and OMI. To help near-real time users navigate this large data offering, a new imagery service was begun in 2011 – Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS). This service provides very responsive viewing using the Web Map Tile Service protocol. These programs will continue to support and expand the use of Terra data for near-real time applications well into the future.",

The INCA observations were obtained from a distance of about 137-250 Jovian planetary radii (RJ) over an energy range from about 10 to 300 keV. These observations have been demonstrated to be consistent with a neutral gas torus encircling Jupiter at Europa’s orbit (Mauk et al., 2004). Here, we present a new, detailed analysis of the ENA images implying an asymmetric Europa neutral gas torus with indications of magnetospheric dynamics. The analysis uses images with a minimum integration time and background. A forward model using a parametric energetic ion model and a neutral gas model simulates ENA images through the instrument response function of INCA in order to determine the spatial distribution of the neutral gas.",

            "abstract": "Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) have a profound effect on atmospheric chemistry and composition, and thereby affect global air quality and climate. The Amazon rainforest constitutes an intense source of BVOCs and is thus a key location in which to probe these effects. Notable uncertainties remain regarding the amount of BVOCs emitted from the rainforest (a function of plant type, environmental conditions and physiological factors) and the quantitative influence they have on atmospheric oxidants, such as OH and O3 (a function of physical conditions and ambient atmospheric composition, not least the concentration of nitrogen oxides; NOx=NO+NO2). The effect that isoprene oxidation at low NOx concentrations has on the concentrations of OH and O3 proves a particular challenge to reproduce in atmospheric chemistry-transport models.\nWe present here the results of a series of experiments aimed at testing our understanding of BVOC emissions from the Brazilian Amazon and the atmospheric chemistry stemming from these. We attempt to reproduce aircraft measurements of BVOCs, NOx and O3 from the South American Biomass Burning Analysis (SAMBBA) campaign in 2012, including those made close to the site of recent BVOC emission measurements, just north of Manaus, in the Cooperative LBA Atmospheric Regional Experiment (CLAIRE-UK). We compare the abilities of a variety of atmospheric chemistry mechanisms to capture the measurements in both a global atmospheric chemistry-transport model and a trajectory model of chemistry and transport. The exploration in both Eulerian and Lagrangian frameworks, with their contrasting treatments of mixing, is pertinent in view of: the sensitivity that the chemistry stemming from BVOCs shows to ambient NOx concentrations; and the episodic influence of anthropogenic emissions in this environment, for example from Manaus.",

            "abstract": "In West Africa, surface atmosphere exchanges have been found to impact both regional and local features of the Monsoon. At local scale the spatial patterns of Evaporative Fraction can drive the trajectories of mesoscale convective systems. Under Sudanian climate a mean of ~80% of the precipitation return to atmosphere through evapotranspiration but this important amount and its dynamics may vary with the vegetation cover. In consequence, any land use or climate changes can lead to modifications on the surface feedbacks and thus on both the atmospheric and the continental water cycle. In West Africa, Sudanian regions are submitted to a ~3% demographical increase per year, which leads to regular deforestation to the benefit of cultivated areas. This study aims at quantifying the changes in evapotranspiration regime caused by such a land use change under Sudanian climate.\nWithin the framework of The AMMA-CATCH observatory, energy and water vapor fluxes were investigated in west Africa since 2007. Herein, a pluri-annual (2007 – 2010) energy budget of a clear forest and a cultivated area located in northern Benin are analysed. Results show that evapotranspiration rates over the sudanian forest are higher than those of cultivated area, because of agricultural practice and water availability for trees. After harvest, the residual vegetation is burned to bring nutriment to soil and to clean the landscape around the villages. Thus, during the dry season, the cultivated areas are bare. At the same time, a significant evapotranspiration is measured over the forest area despite the lack of precipitations. The deep root system of such vegetation allow the trees to get access to water during the dry season. During the rainy season, a significant difference in evapotransiration rates are also observed. These differences lead to a large deficit of water vapor that returns to the atmosphere and will significantly change the continental water cycle when forests will be replaced by cultivated areas",

            "abstract": "Taiwan, one of the most seismically active areas in the world, repeatedly experiences violent earthquakes, such as the 1999 Mw 7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake, in highly populated areas. The main island of Taiwan lies in the convergent tectonic region between the Eurasian Plate and Philippine Sea Plate.\nFault pseudotachylytes form by frictional melting along the fault plane during large seismic slip events and therefore constitute earthquake fossils. The width of a pseudotachylyte generation vein is a crude proxy for earthquake magnitude. The attitude of oblique injection veins primarily reflects slip kinematics. Additional constraints on the seismic slip direction and slip sense can be obtained 1) from the principal axes of the magnetic fabric of generation veins and 2) from 3D tomographic analysis of vein geometry.\nA new pseudotachylyte locality discovered along the Hoping River offers an unparalleled opportunity to learn more about the Plio-Pleistocene paleoseismology and seismic kinematics of northeastern Taiwan. Field work measured the orientations and relations of structural features yields a complex geometry of generation and injection veins. Pseudotachylytes were sampled for tomographic, magnetic fabric and scanning electron microscope analyses. An oriented block of pseudotachylyte was sliced then stitched into a 3-D tomographic model using the Image-J software image stack plug-in. Tomographic analysis shows pseudotachylyte veins originate from a single slip event at sample size. An average vein thickness ranges from 1 mm proximal to areas with abundant injection veins to 2 mm. The displacement calculated after Sibson’s 1975 method, displacement equals the square of vein thickness multiplied by 436 yields a range from 4.36 cm to 17.44 cm. The pseudotachylytes displacement typifies earthquakes less than magnitude 5. However, this crude estimate of displacement requires further discussion. Comparison of the calculated displacements by different methodology may further constrain the values. Improving the accuracy of parameters pertaining to depth, pressure and temperature conditions, faulting style and coseismic fluids will vastly affect these displacement values. Aspects of focal mechanism determination leads to a more comprehensive assessment of both prehistoric and modern seismic risk.",

Pointer Ridge is a ridge situated on the passive China continental margin formed by down slope erosion of the continental slope material on either side of the ridge. High methane flux rate and several seismic chimneys were observed in this area from previous studies, which may imply active ongoing fluid migration processes. To find the possible fluid migration pathways and understand the fluid migration processes, we firstly use both 2D and 3D seismic images to map the spatial distribution of the BSRs, and to identify the structural and sedimentary features in our study area. Secondly, seismic attribute analyses are carried out for fluid migration pathways detection and fault seal analysis. Finally, we propose a conceptual model to illustrate how fluids migrate along those pathways to the seafloor. The results show that the fluid migration pathways obtained from seismic attribute analysis results correlate well with the chimney and fault structures recognized from conventional seismic amplitude sections. We suggest that high angle normal faults may play an important role for fluid migrating upward, and the ongoing fluid migration processes will increase the seafloor instabilities. Since the Pointer Ridge is a gas hydrate leaking site, our results could provide useful information for further risk evaluation.",

            "abstract": "Since the Spanish Period (1600s), natural hot spring waters have been harnessed for balneological purposes in the municipalities of Calamba and Los Banos, Laguna, south of Metro Manila. There are at more than a hundred hot spring resorts in Brgy. Pansol, Calamba and Tadlac, Los Banos. These two areas are found at the northern flanks of Mt. Makiling facing Laguna de Bay. This study aims to provide some insights on the physical and chemical characteristics of hot spring resorts and the possible impact on the lake water quality resulting from the disposal of used water. Initial ocular survey of the resorts showed that temperature of the pool water ranges from ambient (>300C) to as high as 500C with an average pool size of 80m3. Water samples were collected from a natural hot spring and pumped well in Los Banos and another pumped well in Pansol to determine the chemistry. The field pH ranges from 6.65 to 6.87 (Pansol springs). Cation analysis revealed that the thermal waters belonged to the Na-K-Cl-HCO3 type with some trace amount of heavy metals. Methods for waste water disposal are either by direct discharge down the drain of the pool or by discharge in the public road canal. Both methods will dump the waste water directly into Laguna de Bay. Taking in consideration the large volume of waste water used especially during the peak season, the effect on the lake water quality would be significant. It is therefore imperative for the environmental authorities in Laguna to regulate and monitor the chemistry of discharges from the pool to protect both the lake water as well as groundwater quality.",

            "abstract": "Sea ice-atmosphere interactions are major drivers of patterns of sea ice drift and deformations in the Polar regions, and affect snow erosion and deposition at the surface. Here, we combine analyses of sea ice surface topography at very high-resolutions (1-10 cm), and Large Eddy Simulations (LES) to study surface drag and snow erosion and deposition patterns from process scales to floe scales (1 cm – 100 m). The snow/ice elevations were obtained using a Terrestrial Laser Scanner during the SIPEX II (Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystem eXperiment II) research voyage to East Antarctica (September-November 2012). LES are performed on a regular domain adopting a mixed pseudo-spectral/finite difference spatial discretization. A scale-dependent dynamic subgrid-scale model based on Lagrangian time averaging is adopted to determine the eddy-viscosity in the bulk of the flow. Effects of larger-scale features of the surface on wind flows (those features that can be resolved in the LES) are accounted for through an immersed boundary method. Conversely, drag forces caused by subgrid-scale features of the surface should be accounted for through a parameterization. However, the effective aerodynamic roughness parameter z0 for snow/ice is not known. Hence, a novel dynamic approach is utilized, in which z0 is determined using the constraint that the total momentum flux (drag) must be independent on grid-filter scale. We focus on three ice floe surfaces. The first of these surfaces (October 6, 2012) is used to test the performance of the model, validate the algorithm, and study the spatial distributed fields of resolved and modeled stress components. The following two surfaces, scanned at the same location before and after a snow storm event (October 20/23, 2012), are used to propose an application to study how spatially resolved mean flow and turbulence relates to observed patterns of snow erosion and deposition. We show how erosion and deposition patterns are correlated with the computed stresses, with modeled stresses having higher explanatory power. Deposition is mainly occurring in wake regions of specific ridges that strongly affect wind flow patterns. These larger ridges also lock in place elongated streaks of relatively high speeds with axes along the stream-wise direction, and which are largely responsible for the observed erosion.",

It has been shown that the variation in wind speed across the vortex region correlates with local gravity wave activity.

            "abstract": "With the recent explosion in the use and availability of unmanned aerial vehicle platforms and development of easy to use structure from motion software, UAV based photogrammetry is increasingly being adopted to produce high resolution topography for the study of surface processes. UAV systems can vary substantially in price and complexity, but the tradeoffs between these and the quality of the resulting data are not well constrained. We look at one end of this spectrum and evaluate the effectiveness of a simple low cost UAV setup for obtaining high resolution topography in a challenging field setting. Our study site is the Daan River gorge in western Taiwan, a rapidly eroding bedrock gorge that we have monitored with terrestrial Lidar since 2009. The site presents challenges for the generation and analysis of high resolution topography, including vertical gorge walls, vegetation, wide variation in surface roughness, and a complicated 3D morphology. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the UAV-derived topography, we compare it with terrestrial Lidar data collected during the same survey period. Our UAV setup combines a DJI Phantom 2 quadcopter with a 16 megapixel Canon Powershot camera for a total platform cost of less than $850. The quadcopter is flown manually, and the camera is programmed to take a photograph every 5 seconds, yielding 200-250 pictures per flight. We measured ground control points and targets for both the Lidar scans and the aerial surveys using a Leica RTK GPS with 1-2 cm accuracy. UAV derived point clouds were obtained using Agisoft Photoscan software. We conducted both Lidar and UAV surveys before and after a summer typhoon season, allowing us to evaluate the reliability of the UAV survey to detect geomorphic changes in the range of one to several meters. We find that this simple UAV setup can yield point clouds with an average accuracy on the order of 10 cm compared to the Lidar point clouds. Well-distributed and accurately located ground control points are critical, but we achieve good accuracy with even with relatively few ground control points (25) over a 150,000 sq m area. The large number of photographs taken during each flight also allows us to explore the reproducibility of the UAV-derived topography by generating point clouds from different subsets of photographs taken of the same area during a single survey.",

            "abstract": "We report the first accurate and precise data for mass-dependent fractionation of tungsten (W) stable isotopes, using a double spike technique and MC-ICPMS. Results are expressed relative to the NIST 3136 W isotope standard as per mil deviations in 186W/184W (δ186W). Although heavy element mass-dependent fractionations are expected to be small, Tl and U both display significant low temperature isotopic fractionations. Theoretical calculations indicate that W nuclear volume isotopic effects should be smaller than mass-dependent fractionations at low temperatures. Hydrogenetic ferromanganese (Fe-Mn) crusts precipitate directly from seawater and have been used as paleoceanographic recorders of temporal changes in seawater chemistry. Crusts are strongly enriched in W and other metals, and are a promising medium for exploring W isotopic variability. Tungsten has a relatively long residence time in seawater of ~61,000 years, mainly as the tungstate ion (WO42-). Water depth profiles show conservative behaviour. During adsorption on Fe-Mn crusts, W species form inner-sphere complexes in the hexavalent (W6+) state. The major host phase is thought to be Mn oxides and the lighter W isotope is expected to be absorbed preferentially. Surface scrapings of 13 globally distributed hydrogenetic Fe-Mn crusts display δ186W from -0.08 to -0.22‰ (±0.03‰, 2sd). A trend toward lighter W isotope composition exists with increasing water depth (~1500 to ~5200m) and W concentration. One hydrothermal Mn-oxide sample is anomalously light and Mn nodules are both heavy and light relative to Fe-Mn crusts. Tungsten speciation depends on concentration, pH, and time in solution and is not well understood because of the extremely slow kinetics of the reactions. In addition, speciation of aqueous and/or adsorbed species might be sensitive to pressure, showing similar thermodynamic stability but different effective volumes. Thus, W stable isotopes might be used as a water-depth barometer in marine environments; time-series in Fe-Mn crusts may show a heavier isotope composition in older crust layers due to the shallower water environments in the early history of the seamounts on which the crusts grow.",

            "abstract": "The Southwest Portuguese Margin sedimentary record is influenced by the Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW), with a strong thermohaline signature occurring between 500 and 1500m water depth. Variations of MOW intensity during the Late Quaternary (±750ky) are related to changes in the global climate and in the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation. To validate the sedimentary climate records on the Southwestern Portuguese Margin we performed a regional core-top multi-proxy study (Corg, CaCO3, grain size, foraminifera abundances, stable isotopes) to distinguish the MOW effects in recent sediments. The influence of this high velocity bottom current is marked in sediments by a strong increase of the sand content at both, the upper and lower, MOW boundaries. An increase of fine sediments is due to winnowing by the current, resulting in a drastic change in the accumulation rates of any sand-sized biogenic particle. For this reason, some of the traditional productivity proxies used such as Corg, planktonic and benthic foraminifera total abundances, should not be used at sites under the influence of contour currents. However, we demonstrate that the planktonic foraminifera relative abundances can be used with confidence because they are independent of the action of the MOW. Based on the planktonic foraminifera assemblages in two IODP Sites, U1387 recovered from the MOW influenced Faro Drift, and U1385 recovered at 2578m, we reconstruct the sea surface temperature (SST) and export productivity (Pexp) during the beginning of the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, Marine Isotope Stages 36 and 35. At Site U1387: i) foraminifera-derived SST was compared with biomarkers SST and foraminiferal δ18O data; ii) foraminifera-derived Pexp was compared with the Corg; and iii) the influence of the MOW on the sediments was deducted from the weight percent of the sand fraction, indicating contourite layers, and the benthic foraminiferal δ18O and δ13C data.",

            "abstract": "The Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR5) provides global estimates of future cumulative carbon dioxide emissions of anthropogenic origin, for various representative concentration pathways (RCP). For example, for an approximately 50% probability of limiting the increase in temperature to 2 deg. C, the table shows that the limit on cumulative global carbon-dioxide emissions is 780 Gt of carbon between 2012 and 2100. We can now ask what each nation will get as a share of the globally allowed cumulative emissions. Corresponding to this share of cumulative emissions, every nation will have the flexibility to consider a range of emissions trajectories within its share. This paper calculates the “entitlements” and potential emissions (based on some reasonable growth and reduction rates) using four different methods for all the four RCPs discussed in the IPCC report – i) simply allocating the remaining carbon space (for the period from 2012 to 2100) on a per capita basis amongst the regions; ii) calculating entitlements for the period between 1850 and 2100 based on total emissions emitted in the past and allowed in the future divided among countries on a per capita basis; iii) the entitlements calculated in (ii) are weighted by per capita GDP to include a measure of ‘capability’ while calculating entitlements; iv) the entitlements calculated in (ii) are weighted by non-income HDI as another measure of ‘capability’. The values are benchmarked against the potential emissions for the future resulting from the commitments already made by different countries and regions towards mitigation. The paper then goes on to provide an estimate for the avoided cost of carbon for India given a range of constraints on emissions that it will have to undertake as a part of such a schema of allocating the mitigation burden.",

            "abstract": "Over the last century, the northeastern United States has warmed by over 1C, with the region of strongest warming found in coastal Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. These states are amongst the fastest warming in the entire country and the region as a whole is also warming faster than the national average. While these records all appear exceptional in the context of the last century, it is not known how these compare on longer time scales, to potential preindustrial late Holocene warm epochs, and in the context of decadal-scale variability in regional climate. Here, we develop a January through August temperature reconstruction using three Chamaecyparis thyoides (Atlantic White Cedar) chronologies in Massachusetts and Maine. The chronologies show a strong winter-spring-summer temperature signal representative of temperature variability from southern New York to northeastern Maine. The reconstruction is skillful and tracks upwards temperature trends since the early 19th century, reproducing decadal scale variability associated with warming from the 1920s through 1940s, cooling in the region from the 1940s until the 1960s, and warming since that time. No year since at least the middle of the 19th century is as warm as the Janaury through August temperatures seen in the exceptionally warm 2012. Recent modeling experiments simulate a range of decadal warming trends for the northeastern United States that is slightly higher than the reconstructed and instrumental trends. Atlantic White Cedar holds the potential to develop multicentury temperature reconstructions from this heavily-populated region.",

In this study, we analyzed droughts using indices based on precipitation and soil moisture during the period of 1960-2010 in Haihe basin, which is a typical drought-prone region in North China. The Soil Moisture Drought Severity (SMDS) and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) are used to evaluate drought severity. SMDS is calculated based on the monthly soil moisture of upper 50cm from the simulation by Community Land Model (CLM 4.0) and SPI is calculated based on gridded precipitation at 0.05° resolution (5 km × 5 km approximately), which is spatially interpolated from observations. During the last 51 years, 36 severe drought events (affecting areas greater than 20,000 km2 and durations longer than 3 months) have been identified based on SMDS, and 41 drought events identified based on SPI. Results derived from SMDS indicate that there is a significant increasing trend in the drought affected area, and that the drought event occurred in 1999 has the largest affected area. Compared with the drought events derived from SMDS, the events derived from SPI have shorter durations but larger affected areas on average. Although the mean NDVI of the whole basin has been increasing since the 1980s, the two declining periods of 1992-1994 and 1999-2003 show fairly good agreement with the drought events identified in the same periods. Comparison between SMDS and SPI shows the superiority of SMDS for drought assessment in the perspective of terrestrial ecosystem.\nKeywords:\nDrought analysis; Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI); Soil Moisture Drought Severity (SMDS); Community Land Model; Haihe basin",

An other problem is its size for large data sets. We use a model reduction method (Zaslavsky et al, 2013), that compresses the Jacobian by projecting it with a Rational Krylov Subspace (RKS). It also reduces the runtime drastically, compared to the most common adjoint approach and was implemented on GPU.\nIt depends on an analytic derivation of the implicit Anzatz function, which solves Maxwell's diffusion equation in the Eigenspace giving a Jacobian dependent on the Eigenpairs and its derivatives of the forward problem. The Eigenpairs are approximated by Ritz-pairs in the Rational Krylov subspace. Determination of the derivived Ritz-pairs is the most time consuming and was fully GPU-optimized. Furthermore, the amount of inversion cells is reduced by using Octree meshes. The gridding allows for the incorporation of complicated survey geometries, as they are encountered in marine CSEM datasets.\nAs a first result, the Jacobian computation is, even on a Desktop, faster than the most common adjoint approach on a super computer for realistic data sets. We will present careful benchmarking and accuracy tests of the new method and show how it can be applied to a real marine scenario.",

Other indices, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) are also commonly used to monitor plant activity using remote sensing techniques. Determining the best indices for plant health, calculating carbon fixation efficiently and economically, and developing reliable ground truthing methods for satellite data will allow monitoring and comparison of regional scale carbon fluxes. In this study, spectral measurements made with a passive field spectroradiometer were used to record spectral radiances from a selection of plants in the laboratory and field. SIF is less complicated to extract under limited wavelength illumination in the laboratory. These were used to validate the Fraunhofer Line Depth Method (FLD) applied to field measurements under solar illumination. SIF, NDVI, and PRI were calculated from the spectral measurements to determine functioning of the plants and to estimate carbon fixation under both normal and water stress conditions. Previous literature and preliminary findings suggest SIF is an earlier indicator of stress and clearer estimator of carbon uptake than NDVI or PRI. Therefore, SIF is a potential monitoring index for photosynthetic activity and its retrieval with this instrument and process is desirable. We will report on the comparison of laboratory and field estimates of SIF, the evaluation of plant health indices, and the changes in SIF with stress. Given strong evidence that obtaining accurate carbon flux information via this remote sensing process is possible, this retrieval method could be reliably utilized as ground truth data for OCO2 and OCO3. In the near future, ground spectral data such as these can be combined with OCO2 data for regional monitoring and comparisons of carbon fixation, advancing carbon flux calculations and carbon-climate connections.",

            "abstract": "The negative-AU events are relatively unusual, which have caught our attention. To understand the cause of negative AU, we first eliminate the ring-current effect by considering only the events with AU<SYM-H. Most of the events are associated with an arrival of a magnetic cloud. The interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) at 1 AU has strong negative Bz and By components during these negative-AU events. We also found that one of the negative AU events has been reported by Feldstein et al. (2006). They associated the enhancement of westward electric jet by the negative IMF-By component based on previous models obtained independently by Friis-Christensen et al. (1972) and Sumaruk & Feldstein (1973). Enhancement of electric jet in opposite direction is expected to be found when the IMF-By is positive. To verify their models we also examine the strong AU events with AU > 1200nT. We found that these large-AU events are associated with IMF-Bz<0 and IMF-By >0. Both negative-AU and large-AU events tend to occur during the beginning of the main phase of a strong magnetic storm with Kp= 7~9. The enhancement of Cowling electrojet has been proposed by Kan et al. (2011) for the triggering of substorm onset. We will discuss the possibility that a similar enhancement process might take place in the dayside auroral oval during these extreme AU events.",

            "abstract": "20% of the Earth’s land surface burns annually representing a critical exchange of energy between the land and atmosphere via combustion. Fires range from small spreading surface fires to intense dramatic crown fire events, depending on the fuels and climate where they burn. Fire is a powerful selective force on plants: over the last 420 million years the plant traits required to tolerate fire, and in some cases to promote particular types of fire regimes have evolved. However, most Earth System studies focus on the links between climate and fire, ignoring the fact that these relationships are mediated by the fuels – by plant structure and function. We argue via multiple lines of evidence that the flammability of an ecosystem is influenced by the vegetation present, and that this vegetation is not a passive outcome of certain climate and fire properties, but is also the result of evolutionary forces, biological and biophysical feedbacks and biogeographic contingencies. Hence, understanding current patterns of fire and vegetation, as well as longer-term patterns of fire over deep time, requires a framework that can incorporate evolution and biogeography, and in particular, plant traits.

            "abstract": "Although subduction is a first order plate tectonic process, the factors controlling the dynamics of slab roll-back and back-arc formation are still not very well understood. We present self-consistent thermo-mechanical models to study oceanic subduction, slab retreat, and back arc formation. We focus on two aspects of the subduction process: 1) factors that control retreat of the subduction zone, and 2) those that control the opening of the back arc. The model evolution is calculated using 2D plane strain thermo-mechanical finite element techniques for the finite element solution of incompressible viscous-plastic creeping flows (Fullsack, 1995). The models extend from the surface to 660 km depth. The upper surface of the model is free to move. We investigate interaction of the subducting slab with the overlying plate and focus on factors that may control the opening of a back-arc basin. The down going plate is driven by a kinematic boundary condition, far from the subduction zone. After an initial stage of far-field driven contraction, negative buoyant down welling of the oceanic lithosphere may drive continued subduction zone leading to mature subduction and the formation of an extensional back arc. The models suggest that two primary factors are required for slab retreat and the formation of an extensional back-arc system: 1) Convective destabilization and weakening of the overlying continental back arc region, and 2) sufficient negative buoyancy of the subducting plate.",

            "abstract": "The subduction of hydrated slab mantle to beyond-arc depths is the most important and yet weakly constrained factor in the quantification of the Earth’s deep geologic water cycle. During subduction of hydrated oceanic lithosphere, dehydration reactions in the downgoing plate lead to a partitioning of water between upper and lower plate. Water retained in the slab is recycled into the mantle where it controls its rheology and thus plate tectonic velocities. Hence, quantification of the water partitioning in subduction zones is crucial for the understanding of mass transfer between the Earth’s surface and the mantle.\nCombined thermomechanical and thermodynamic models yield quantitative constraints on the water cycle in subduction zones, but unless model results can be linked to natural observations, the reliability of such models remains speculative. We present combined thermomechanical, thermodynamic and geochemical models of active and paleo-subduction zones, whose results can be tested with independent geochemical features in natural rocks. In active subduction zones, evidence for the validity of our model comes from the agreement between modeled and observed across-arc trends of boron concentrations and isotopic compositions in arc volcanic rocks. In the Kamchatkan subduction zone, for example, the model successfully predicts complex geochemical patterns and the spatial distribution of arc volcanoes.\nIn paleo-subduction zones (e.g. Western Gneiss Region and Western Alps), constraints on the water budget and dehydration behavior of the subducting slab come from trace element zoning patterns in ultra-high pressure (UHP) garnets. Distinct enrichments of Cr, Ni and REE in the UHP zones of the garnets can be reconciled by our models that predict intense rehydration and trace element re-enrichment of the eclogites at UHP conditions by fluids released from the underlying slab mantle.\nModels of present-day subduction zones indicate the presence of 2.5-6 wt.% of water within the uppermost 15 km of the subducted slab mantle. Depending on hydration depth, between 25 and 90% of this water is recycled into the deeper mantle. The Lower Devonian example from the Western Gneiss Region indicates that subduction of water into the Earth’s deeper mantle is an active process at least since the middle Paleozoic.",

To grasp the true mechanisms for these changes and to identify both local and wider-scale variations, in-depth studies into these terrestrial deposits will continue to be undertaken. Using the well-researched Nussloch loess-palaeosol deposits in Germany, we provide insight into the depositional and post-depositional processes that occurred during the Last Glacial period via an anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) study. Post-depositional deformation is identified within several depth intervals that are defined by: prolate orientation population distributions, scattering of the principal susceptibility axes and where a dipping foliation plane is observed. This magnetic fabric is associated with gleying-induced processes and the initiation of gelifluction. Any intervals with a primary aeolian fabric show no evidence of a preferred orientation in the maximum susceptibility axes of the AMS ellipsoid. Furthermore, soil-forming processes did not appear to play an important role in modifying the parent loess fabric, suggesting only weak pedogenesis occurred. In addition to the Nussloch sequence, AMS on a targeted depth range from a profile in Achenheim, France, is presented to decipher the depositional and post-depositional fabrics in Western European loess on both sides of the Rhine valley.",

            "abstract": "Geomagnetic excursions are short-lived deviations of the geomagnetic field from the normal range of secular variation. Despite significant advances in geomagnetic excursion research over the past 20 years, fundamental questions remain concerning the typical duration and global morphology of excursional geomagnetic fields. To answer such questions, more high-resolution, chronologically well-constrained excursion records are required, particularly from the Southern Hemisphere. We present preliminary paleomagnetic records of the Laschamp (~41 ka) and Mono Lake (~35 ka) excursions from three marine sediment cores from the Bounty Trough, New Zealand margin, and complementary volcanic records of the Laschamp excursion from lavas of Mt Ruapehu, New Zealand. Relatively high sedimentation rates of 12 – 26 cm/kyr in the Bounty Trough during glacial periods allow identification of excursional field behavior at each of the studied core locations. Each core displays one or two excursional events, with rapid directional swings between stable normal polarity and reversed excursional directions, each associated with coincident relative paleointensity minima. These anomalous paleomagnetic directions are interpreted to represent the Laschamp and Mono Lake excursions, based on a combination of tephrochronology, radiocarbon dating, and cyclostratigraphy (defined from core-scanning X-ray fluorescence and magnetic susceptibility records). Beside these records, we present results from fourteen lava flows, on Mt Ruapehu, for which 40Ar-39Ar dating indicates ages of between 39 and 45 ka. The step heating 40Ar-39Ar experiments produced particularly flat age plateaus, with corresponding 2 s.d. errors mostly approaching 1 kyr. The youngest and oldest flows carry normal polarity magnetization, however six flows, dated between 41 and 43 ka, display transitional field characteristics. Three of these flows display a declination swing of around 180o, which coincides with a previously published result from the Auckland Basalt Field. Together, these data provide rare excursion records from the southern hemisphere, which will provide an improved view of geomagnetic field morphology during these excursions.",

            "abstract": "Mercury (Hg) speciation in the water column was successfully performed on samples from the Tyrrhenian Sea during the cruise Fenice2011. Primary objective was to increase sampling’s spatial resolution; thereby providing better insight into Hg biogeochemical cycling in environment with naturally higher Hg background. THg values ranged from 0.8 pM to 5.9 pM with an average of 2.5 ± 1.3 pM. Generally, the water column did not exhibit particular variation in THg values. The highest concentrations were measured in the coastal areas near Piombino industrial site and near geothermally active Ustica Island.DGM concentrations were on average 0.39 ± 0.23 pM and ranged from approximately 0.06 pM to 0.83 pM. DGM represented between 2 % and 96 % of THg, with higher proportions measured in deep sea water. This region is a source of Hg0 to the atmosphere, indicated by near depletion of DGM at surface. Waters became increasingly enriched in DGM below 250 m depth, with values ranging from 0.54 pM to 0.83 pM. The observed increase in deep waters was partly due to geothermal activity in the area. MeHg values ranged between 0.01 pM and 0.36 pM with an average of 0.097 ± 0.088 pM. The open sea stations had a slightly higher average value of 0.14 ± 0.10 pM. The surface was generally depleted in MeHg, which was enriched at depths showing oxygen consumption. That suggests spatial coupling with microbial carbon mineralization. Results with increased spatial resolution of sampling clearly show that besides transformations in the mixed layer, more attention should also be given to deeper water masses, particularly because of geothermal activity of the area. In light of global and regional changes of ocean and climate characteristics, minor variations in environmental conditions may change the ratios of Hg species. Toxic MeHg will accumulate and pose threat to human and wildlife populations, whereas DGM formation will only add Hg to the most effective global distribution system, the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Analyzed in the article are different asthenosphere magma generation regimes above the upper mantle hot spots as thermodynamic and geometric parameters of the upper mantle and the conditions on its boundaries vary. The two-layer mantle model is applied to consider the formation of decompression melting areas. The thickness of metasomatically altered lithospheric mantle is determined by the mantle substance rheology and the location of the upper boundary of asthenosphere. We also take into consideration the principal solid state phase transitions by using the mantle substance state equation. The sizes and distribution of hot spots as well as their maximal temperature were defined by the thermodynamic conditions of the perovskite transition existence. The numerical analysis results demonstrate the manifestation of three main mantle dynamics modes; the conditions necessary to form the partial melting zones are not reached; some melting areas with the 30 to 65 Ma existence time do occur; the melting areas that are formed exist permanently. The permanently existing asthenosphere zones are marked by quasiperiodical variation in thickness and the degree of melting. The typical temperatures of a hot spot sharing these modes are the 1740°С and 2020°С correspondingly. The originally presupposed heating degree and the temperature ratio of the upper mantle do influence the decompression melting degree substantially and – to a lesser extent – they influence the size of melting zones. The primary evolution of the second mode is described by the development of a complex system of asthenosphere zones that lead to the occurrence of additional convectional cells dividing the partial melting zone. The variation in the rheological properties of the mantle substance also contributes to the manifestation of the complex structure of asthenosphere zone.\nThe work was made with support of the Russian Foundation for Basic Research grant #12-05-00625.",

The main area of 3D coverage extends from 9º42-57’N, spanning the seafloor extent of two documented volcanic eruptions. There, the 3D geometry of the mid-crustal axial magma lens (AML), located ~1.5 km below the seafloor, was initially investigated using a best 1D stacking velocity function hung from the seafloor and two-pass post-stack time migration. Preliminary results suggested a relatively narrow (~0.5-1.8 km wide) AML showing fingering and overlap of individual magma bodies, particularly in association with several small-scale ridge-axis discontinuities identified from seafloor morphology and structure of the axial summit trough. A westward-dipping limb of the AML was imaged near 9º51’N, where the AML attains its largest width. From 9º53-56’N, the AML was seen to veer slightly westward, in accordance with a shift in orientation of the ridge. Sub-axial magma lenses (SAMLs) have been recently imaged between 9º20’ and 9º56’N on along-axis reflection profiles from the same survey, with the suggestion that these deeper lenses may have contributed melts to the 2005/06 eruption. In the cross-axis dataset, SAML events are observed down to ~600-700 ms (~1.7-2 km) below the AML. They sometimes appear slightly offset with respect to the center of the AML. They are generally less bright than the AML reflection, some of them display prominent diffraction tails on un-migrated sections, and the deeper events have a distinctly lower frequency content than the shallower ones. New images for the 9º42-57’N area are currently being generated from a suite of detailed stacking velocities for the AML and SAML events and 3D post-stack time migration, which will provide insight into the width and along-axis continuity of individual magma bodies at multiple levels within the crust. The fine-scale AML structure will be constrained from the reprocessed seismic volume, beyond the main features noted above. The 3D geometry of the AML and SAMLs will be discussed in relation with other ridge properties along this ~27-km long section of the EPR.",

            "abstract": "Planning, delivery and monitoring of integrated environmental, social and economic outcomes from agri-environmental payments to land owners has rarely been attempted at a national scale. Wales has launched one of the most ambitious projects ever within the EU to frame both delivery of payments and ongoing integrated assessment of outcomes within an ecosystem framework. Payment and evaluation activities are running simultaneously, which when combined with scenario analysis from a suite of biophysical and landscape quality models, allows for adaptive management as the scheme progresses. Social and economic benefits and constraints to uptake of scheme measures and desired outcomes are embedded within the project to ensure benefits to the wider population are realised.\nInitial modelling results in the first year of the monitoring and evaluation programme quantified potential benefits from a range of management options offered under the subsidy scheme. At a national scale these ranged from: 1 to 9% improvement in flood mitigation; 5 to 10% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions; increased accessible land for ‘generic’ broadleaf focal species by 3 to 12%, increased national carbon storage by ca. 0.4%, and reduced eroded soil and phosphorus delivery by up to 15% due to reduced connectivity of erodible land to rivers and lakes. Results at local / farm scales could be as high as 80% in some locations. A 75% improvement in habitat for selected 21 indicator plant species was also projected.\nThe inter-dependency between outcomes is being explored through a major integrated rolling monitoring programme taking co-located measurements of soil, vegetation, landuse, soils, water, birds and pollinators, GHG fluxes, landscape and historic features and farmer / landowner surveys using a stratified sampling approach across the country. In addition to scenario analysis, modelling is being used to upscale and integrate findings and to explore the extent of co-benefits and trade-offs between outcomes e.g. using the LUCI model.\nThe integrated monitoring and modelling approach will be presented together with an introduction to the model ensemble. Outputs from the initial scenario runs plus initial findings from the wider social and economic assessments and trade-off analysis will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The interpretation of shear wave splitting, one of the principal observables in the investigation of anisotropy in the crust and upper mantle, has been largely based on the ray-theory modeling of a single vertically incident plane wave. This approximation results in the rejection of shear-wave splitting measurements in many cases, thus severely limits our ability to make full use of shear-wave splitting data to resolve the spatial variations in anisotropy. Here we adopt a full-wave approach to the inversion of 3D anisotropy structure using the sensitivity (Fréchet) kernels calculated by an efficient and flexible algorithm based on the normal-mode theory. The full-wave sensitivity kernels accurately account for all the interactions of multiple phases and widen the range of possibilities in the source-receiver geometry amenable for making shear-wave splitting measurements. We apply the full-wave kernels to the splitting measurements using records of the Southern California Seismic Network from ~150 events, and combine them with a wavelet-based model parameterization in a multi-scale inversion for the anisotropic structure. In addition, we quantify the spatial resolution of our tomography inversion by a rigorous analysis based on the statistical resolution matrix approach, which provides an efficient way to estimate the resolution lengths of the inversion without explicitly calculating the resolution matrix. Results show that the finest resolution length in our inversion can be ~25 km in the region with densely-distributed stations. The anisotropic model shows that the azimuths of the fast axis in the lithosphere can be related to surface geologic features such as the Salton Trough, the Transverse Ranges and the San Andreas Fault. A weaker anisotropy in the asthenosphere may imply a vertical flow beneath the North American Plate.",

            "abstract": "The observation of plasmoids and flux-ropes in the Earth’s magnetotail was crucial to establish the simultaneous presence of multiple x-lines in the tail, and has become the basis for the Near Earth Neutral Line (NENL) model of substorms. While the “classical” NENL model envisions x-lines that extend across the entire tail, recent observations have shown that neither do the x-lines and resulting plasmoids encompass the entire tail, nor do the x-lines have to lie along the y-axis. The fragmentation of the tail by spatially and temporally limited x-lines has important consequences for the mass and energy budget of the tail. Recent ARTEMIS observations have shown that the plasmoids in the distant tail are limited in the Y direction and some flux ropes are tilted during their tailward propagation. Understanding their formation and evolution during their propagation through the magnetotail shall shred more light on the general energy and flux transport of the Earth’s magnetosphere. In this study we simulate plasmoids and flux-ropes in the Earth’s magnetotail using the Open Global Geospace Circulation Model (OpenGGCM). We investigate the generation mechanisms for tail plasmoids and flux-ropes and their evolution as they propagate in the magnetotail. The simulation results show that the limited extend of NENL controls the length or the Y scale of tail plasmoid and flux rope. In addition, by studying their 3D magnetic topology we find that the tilted flux rope forms due to a progressive spreading of reconnection line along the east-west direction, which produces and releases two ends of the flux rope at different times and in different speeds. By constructing a catalogue of observational signatures of plasmoid and flux rope we compare the differences of their signatures and find that large-scale plasmoids have much weaker core fields than that inside the small-scale flux ropes.",

            "abstract": "Seafloor drill rigs are remotely operated systems that provide a cost effective means to recover sedimentary records of the upper sub-seafloor deposits. Recent increases in their payload included downhole logging tools or autoclave coring systems. We here report on another milestone in using seafloor rigs: The development and installation of shallow borehole observatories.\nThree different systems have been developed for the MeBo seafloor drill, which is operated by MARUM, Univ. Bremen, Germany. A simple design, the MeBoPLUG, separates the inner borehole from the overlying ocean by using o-ring seals at the conical threads of the drill pipe. The systems are self-contained and include data loggers, batteries, thermistors and a differential pressure sensor. A second design, the so-called MeBoCORK, is more sophisticated and also hosts an acoustic modem for data transfer and, if desired, fluid sampling capability using osmotic pumps. Of these MeBoCORKs, two systems have to be distinguished: The CORK-A (A = autonomous) can be installed by the MeBo alone and monitors pressure and temperature inside and above the borehole (the latter for reference). The CORK-B (B = bottom) has a higher payload and can additionally be equipped with geochemical, biological or other physical components. Owing to its larger size, it is installed by ROV and utilises a hotstab connection in the upper portion of the drill string. Either design relies on a hostab connection from beneath which coiled tubing with a conical drop weight is lowered to couple to the formation. These tubes are fluid-saturated and either serve to transmit pore pressure signals or collect pore water in the osmo-sampler. The third design, the MeBoPUPPI (Pop-Up Pore Pressure Instrument), is similar to the MeBoCORK-A and monitors pore pressure and temperature in a self-contained manner. Instead of transferring data upon command using an acoustic modem, the MeBoPUPPI contains a pop-up telemetry with Iridium link. After a predefined period, the data unit with satellite link is released, ascends to the sea surface, and remains there for up to two weeks while sending the long-term data sets to shore.\nIn 2012, 2 MeBoPLUGs, 1 MeBoCORK-A and 1 MeBoCORK-B were installed with MeBo in the Nankai Trough, Japan, and data were successfully downloaded from the CORKs.",

            "abstract": "Data acquisition in complex environmental systems is typically expensive. Therefore, experimental designs should be optimized such that most can be learned about the system at least costs. In the past, optimal design (OD) analyses were mainly restricted to linear or linearized problems and methods. Nonlinear OD methods offer more efficient data collection strategies, because they can better handle the non-linearity exhibited by most coupled environmental systems. However, the much higher computational demand restricts their applicability to models with comparatively low run-times. Our goal is to compare the trade-off between computational efficiency and the obtainable design quality between linear and nonlinear OD methods.\nIn our study, a steady-state model for a section of the river Steinlach (South Germany) was set up and calibrated to measured groundwater head data and on estimated groundwater exchange fluxes. The model involves a Pilot Point parameterization scheme for hydraulic conductivity and six zones with uncertain river bed conductivities.\nIn the linear OD approach, the initial predictive uncertainty of groundwater exchange fluxes and mean travel times are estimated using the PREDUNC utility (Moore and Doherty 2005) of PEST. The parameter calibration was performed with a non-linear global search. A discrete global search method and PREDUNC was then utilized to identify augmented monitoring strategies (additional n measurement locations and data types) that reduce the predictive uncertainty the most.\nFor the nonlinear assessment, a conditional ensemble obtained with Markov-chain Monte Carlo represents the initial state of uncertainty and is used as input to a nonlinear OD framework called PreDIA (Leube et al. 2012). PreDIA can consider any kind of uncertainties and non-linear (statistical) dependencies in data, models, parameters and system drivers during the OD process.\nThe linear and non-linear approaches are compared thoroughly during each step of the model-based OD process. We investigate differences in initial uncertainty levels, estimated relative uncertainty levels and optimized designs. For our case study, we further assess at which step the linear approach starts deviating strongly from the non-linear method, from which point on the further linear analysis becomes unrealistic.",

            "abstract": "We perform hybrid simulations to investigate the acceleration process of pickup ions (PUIs) at corotating interaction regions (CIRs) bounded by forward and reverse shocks. It has conventionally been supposed that PUIs accelerate in the direction of the motional electric field along the shock surface via a shock-drift or shock-surfing process. In contrast, we identify a different process that the efficient PUI acceleration takes place in the field-aligned component, as long as the magnetic field is oblique to the shock. This is due to the magnetic mirror effect at the shock, indicating adiabatic acceleration. The PUIs accelerated via this process are reflected back toward the shock upstream. These reflected energetic PUIs can move back and forth along the magnetic field between a pair of CIRs that are magnetically connected. The PUIs are repeatedly accelerated in each reflection, leading to a maximum energy gain close to 100 keV. The results are partly consistent with the observations recently reported by Wu et al. (2014). Furthermore, this mechanism well accounts for the \"preacceleration\" for the generation of ACRs.",

The magnitudes of these effects depend on the X-ray peak brightness and the duration, which drive the intensity of the ionosphere response when the associated electromagnetic wave hit the sunlit side of the Earth atmosphere. An important aspect defining the severity of damages to HF radio communications and LF navigation signals in a certain area is the local time when each event takes place. In order to improve the understanding of radio signal loss or degradation in the Brazilian sector due to solar X-ray emissions, we analyze total electron content (TEC) maps and curves at selected sites obtained by a GPS network formed by tents of dual-frequency receivers spread all over Brazilian territory. We observe ionospheric local changes during several X-ray events in the 0.1-0.8 nm range identified by GOES satellite. Considering the duration, peak brightness, and local time of the events, our goal is to understand the degree of changes suffered by the ionosphere after these solar X-ray emissions using GPS receivers, namely in the equatorial region and around the southern crest of the equatorial ionospheric anomaly.",

Among the risks, increased frequency and severity of low flow periods in streams would be significant for many in-stream and out-of-stream uses of water. While down-scaled climate projections serve as the basis for understanding impacts of climate change on hydrologic systems, a robust framework for risk assessment incorporates multiple dimensions of risks including the vulnerability of hydrologic systems to climate change impacts. Streamflow records from the southeastern US were examined to assess the vulnerability of streams to increased frequency and severity of low flows. Long-term (>50 years) records provide evidence of more frequent and severe low flows in more streams than would be expected from random chance. Trends in low flows appear to be a result of changes in the temporal distribution rather than the annual amount of preciptation and/or in evaporation. Base flow recession provides an indicator of a stream's vulnerability to such changes. Linkages between streamflow patterns across temporal scales can be used for understanding and asessing stream responses to the various possible expressions of a changing climate.",

            "abstract": "Along plate boundary subduction thrusts, the transformation of smectite to illite within fault gouge at temperatures of ~150C is one of the key mineralogical changes thought to control the updip limit of seismicity. Saffer and Marone (2003) reported illite shale exhibited only velocity-strengthening behavior, whereas illite is widely expected to be velocity-weakening behavior. The limitation of their experiments were temperature, in which the frictional experiments were csrried out at room temperature, although the updip limit of seismogenic zone is thermally controlled that occurs at temperature around 150C. Therefore, in this study, we determined the effect of temperature of frictional properties of smectite and illite and discuss whether the smectite-illite transition accounts for the updip limit of seismogenic zone along subduction thrust. In the frictional experiments, we determined the velocity dependence of sliding friction, which is a key parameter for stable or unstable sliding. After steady-state sliding, the loading velocity of 3 μm/s was abruptly changed to 33 μm/s in each frictional experiments to determine the velocity dependence of these clay minerals. The velocity dependence of both smectite and illite at room temperature shows always positive at normal stress higher than 40 MPa, which is similar to the results of Saffer and Marone (2003). However, at temperature of 200C, illite shows negative values of (a-b), suggesting that illite exhibits unstable velocity-weakening behavior. den Hartog et al. (2012) also showed the velocity-weakening for illite gouge by high temperature ring shear experiments, but the transition from velocity strengthening to weakening occurs at temperature around 250C. These results explain that smectite is potentially aseismic for stable sliding at the subduction thrust, whereas illite becomes seismic due to a negative velocity dependence and unstable sliding at high temperatures. Thus, the smectite-illite transition has a potential to explain the updip limit of seismogenic zone along subduction thrust.",

In this study, satellite-based analysis of carbon monoxide (CO) levels was used to assess the magnitude and distribution of this pollutant throughout Alberta oil sands region. Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) V5 multispectral product that uses both near-infrared and the thermal-infrared radiances for CO retrieval were used. MOPITT-based climatology and inter-annual variations were examined for 12 years (2002-2013) on spatial and temporal scales. Seasonal climatological maps for CO total columns indicated conspicuous spatial variations in all seasons except in winter where the CO spatial variations are less prominent. High CO loadings are observed to extend from the North East to North West regions of Alberta, with highest values in spring. The CO mixing ratios at the surface level in winter and spring seasons exhibited dissimilar spatial distribution pattern where the enhancements are detected in south eastern rather than northern Alberta. Analyzing spatial distributions of Omega at 850 mb pressure level for four seasons implied that, conditions in northeastern Alberta are more favorable for up lofting while in southern Alberta, subsidence of CO emissions are more likely. Time altitude CO profile climatology as well as the inter-annual variability were investigated for the oil sands and main urban regions in Alberta to assess the impact of various sources on CO loading. Monthly variations over urban regions are consistent with the general seasonal cycle of CO in Northern Hemisphere which exhibits significant enhancement in winter and spring, and minimum mixing ratios in summer. The typical seasonal CO variations over the oil sands region are less prominent. This study has demonstrated the potential use of multispectral CO product over Alberta.",

            "abstract": "Vertical axis rotations are a significant component of crustal deformation and provide important constraints on the tectonic history of plate boundaries. Geodetic measurements can be used to calculate present-day rotations whereas paleomagnetic measurements can be used for calculating finite long-term (millions of years) rotations. Here we present a new approach for integrating both datasets through mechanical modeling that links these time scales. We test this approach in northern Israel, a region where a tectonic triple junction lies at the intersection between two deformation zones: (1) The Dead Sea Fault, and (2) The Carmel-Gilboa Fault System. We examined the distribution of crustal deformation and rotation rates near these two major fault zones. First, rotation rates were calculated from current interseismic global positioning system (GPS) measurements that were recorded during 12 years. We analyzed the GPS velocities using a 3D dislocation slip model that takes into account motion on major active faults in the study area. This model was then modified to account for the total deformation of the crust during several seismic cycles. Rotations from the mechanical modeling were compared against finite rotations determined based on primary magnetic remanence directions from 30 Neogenic basaltic sites. Paleomagnetic results indicate significant (>20º) rotations near the edges of fault segments. These results disagree with interseismic rotations calculated from the GPS measurements; however they are in general agreement with the vertical axis rotations obtained from the mechanical model. The comparison to the modified model suggests that the tectonic setting of the Carmel-Gilboa Fault system was fairly stable during the last ~10 Myr. Furthermore, the new suggested method for comparing interseismic recent deformation with long-term deformation provides important new insights on the timing, magnitude and style of deformation near major faults.",

            "abstract": "Previous theoretical studies have investigated the composition-dependence of the spin transition in Fe-bearing MgSiO3 perovskite, finding that the transition pressure is extremely sensitive to atomic configuration. Computational constraints limited these studies to supercell structures containing only one to a few iron atoms in a handful of configurations. Bengston (2008) handled this issue using special quasirandom structures, which approximate a randomized macroscopic sample. Umemoto (2008) considered a set of configurations in large supercells, finding that iron in perovskite prefers to cluster. Although these studies showed that the energetic differences between configurations can be as large as ~10 mHa (3000K thermal energy equivalent), none have yet attempted to fold the configuration-dependence into a thermodynamic ordering model. In this presentation, we report an adaptation of the cluster-site-approximation (Oates, 1999) that enables efficient calculation of order-dependent phase diagrams for perovskite, given a reasonable set of density functional theory calculations of modest supercell sizes.\nRecently, Zhang (2014) reported the occurrence of perovskite disproportionation in high P-T diamond anvil cell experiments. The studies discussed above found that intermediate iron compositions were unstable relative to endmembers, implying potential exsolution, but no experimental evidence for it existed at the time. Zhang (2014) showed that all Fe-bearing perovskite samples with 10% to 40% Fe/[Fe+Mg] underwent exsolution of a hexagonal iron-rich phase when the sample was compressed to 100 GPa prior to heating. This poses a significant apparent contradiction: most studies have found using progressive annealing that iron-bearing perovskite is stable up to the post-perovskite transition (e.g. Dorfman 2013), whereas Zhang (2014) showed that the wait-and-heat method consistently induces disproportionation. We discuss how this is a likely outcome of the ordering tendencies of perovskite and show how the development of iron-rich clusters tends to stabilize perovskite against disproportionation. Finally, we compare the different roles ordering might play under experimental conditions and deep within the Earth.",

Management of this flow while allowing women to pursue their normal daily lives is the purpose of many commercial products. Some of these products, e.g. feminine hygiene pads and tampons, utilize porous materials in achieving their goal. In this paper we will demonstrate different phenomena that have been observed in flow of menstrual fluid through these porous materials, share some of the advances made in experimental and analytical study of these phenomena, and also present some of the unsolved challenges and difficulties encountered while studying this kind of flow.\nMenstrual fluid is generally composed of four main components: blood plasma, blood cells, cervical mucus, and tissue debris. This non-homogeneous, multiphase fluid displays very complex rheological behavior, e. g., yield stress, thixotropy, and visco-elasticity, that varies throughout and between menstrual cycles and among women due to various factors. Flow rates are also highly variable during menstruation and across the population and the rheological properties of the fluid change during the flow into and through the product. In addition to these phenomena, changes to the structure of the porous medium within the product can also be seen due to fouling and/or swelling of the material. This paper will, also, share how the fluid components impact the flow and the consequences for computer simulation, the creation of a simulant fluid and testing methods, and for designing products that best meet consumer needs.\nWe hope to bring to light the challenges of managing this complex flow to meet a basic need of women all over the world. An opportunity exists to apply learnings from research in other disciplines to improve the scientific knowledge related to the flow of this complex fluid through the porous medium that is a sanitary product.",

            "abstract": "Land use/cover change (LUCC) has occurred extensively in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest-savanna transition. Agricultural development-driven LUCC at regional scales can alter surface energy budgets, evapotranspiration (ET) and rainfall; these hydroclimatic changes impact streamflows, and thus hydropower. To date, there is only limited empirical understanding of these complex land-water-energy nexus dynamics, yet understanding is important to developing countries where both agriculture and hydropower are expanding and intensifying.\nTo observe these changes and their interconnections, we synthesize a novel combination of ground network, remotely sensed, and empirically modeled data for LUCC, rainfall, flows, and hydropower potential. We connect the extensive temporal and spatial trends in LUCC occurring from 2000-2012 (and thus observable in the satellite record) to long-term historical flow records and run-of-river hydropower generation potential estimates. Changes in hydrologic condition are observed in terms of dry and wet season moments, extremes, and flow duration curves. Run-of-river hydropower generation potential is modeled at basin gauge points using equation models parameterized with literature-based low-head turbine efficiencies, and simple algorithms establishing optimal head and capacity from elevation and flows, respectively. Regression analyses are used to demonstrate a preliminary causal analysis of LUCC impacts to flow and energy, and discuss extension of the analysis to ungauged basins.\nThe results are transferable to tropical and transitional forest regions worldwide where simultaneous agricultural and hydropower development potentially compete for coupled components of regional water cycles, and where policy makers and planners require an understanding of LUCC impacts to hydroclimate-dependent industries and ecosystems.",

High-speed video (50,000 frames per s) and time-correlated electric field change data show multiple branch ends advance concurrently in the first 6 ms of the flash; each branch begins with IB pulses and propagates first via bursts as an initial leader. Burst luminosity (brightest pixel intensity) is directly related to the IB pulse amplitude. Some initial leader branches transition to advancing as stepped leaders after a few milliseconds. Each initial leader branch end makes the transition to a stepped leader branch end at a slightly different time, resulting in a complex E-change waveform having relatively narrow step-type pulses during the IB stage and no apparent Intermediate stage prior to the Leader stage. There is no visible evidence of an upward propagating leader end prior to the RS, nor of any light above the earliest visible IB luminosity prior to or during the RS. In the RS, the topmost visible portion of the channel that developed as an initial leader (above 5.1 km) appears different (dimmer and with slower speed) from the channel below, indicating it is less conductive. Radar and time-of-arrival lightning source data indicate that the IB luminosity visible to the camera comes from about 6 km deep inside the thundercloud echo. The 1276-m long initial leader transitions to a stepped leader near 4.9 km and the altitude of the radar bright band.",

Using several examples from US Geological Survey environmental disaster responses (e.g., 2001 World Trade Center, mine tailings spills, 2005 Hurricane Katrina, 2007-2013 wildfires, 2011 Gulf oil spill, 2012 Hurricane Sandy, 2013 Colorado floods) and disaster scenarios (2011 ARkStorm, 2013 SAFRR tsunami) this presentation will illustrate the role for collaborative earth, environmental, and health science throughout disaster lifecycles. Pre-disaster environmental baseline measurements are needed to help understand environmental influences on pre-disaster health baselines, and to constrain the magnitude of a disaster’s impacts. During and following disasters, there is a need for interdisciplinary rapid-response and longer-term assessments that: sample and characterize the physical, chemical, and microbial makeup of complex materials generated by the disasters; fingerprint material sources; monitor, map, and model dispersal and evolution of disaster materials in the environment; help understand how the materials are modified by environmental processes; and, identify key characteristics and processes that influence the exposures and toxicity of disaster materials to humans and the living environment. This information helps emergency responders, public health experts, and cleanup managers: 1) identify short- and long-term exposures to disaster materials that may affect health; 2) prioritize areas for cleanup; and 3) develop appropriate disposal solutions or restoration uses for disaster materials. By integrating lessons learned from past disasters with geospatial information on vulnerable sources of natural or anthropogenic contaminants, the environmental health implications of looming disasters or disaster scenarios can be better anticipated, which helps enhance preparedness and resilience. Understanding economic costs of environmental cleanup and environmental-health impacts from disasters is an area of needed research. Throughout all disaster stages, effective communication between diverse scientific disciplines and stakeholder groups is both a necessity and a challenge.",

            "abstract": "National power systems are becoming increasingly sensitive to atmospheric variability as generation from wind (and other renewables) increases. As such, the days-ahead predictability of wind power has significant implications for power system management. At this time horizon, power system operators plan transmission line outages for maintenance. In addition, forecast users begin to form backup strategies to account for the uncertainty in wind power predictions. Under-estimating this uncertainty could result in a failure to meet system security standards, or in the worst instance, a shortfall in total electricity supply. On the other hand, overly conservative assumptions about the forecast uncertainty incur costs associated with the unnecessary holding of reserve power.\nUsing the power system of Great Britain (GB) as an example, we construct time series of GB-total wind power output using wind speeds from either reanalyses or global weather forecasts. To validate the accuracy of these data sets, wind power reconstructions using reanalyses and forecast analyses over a recent period are compared to measured GB-total power output. The results are found to be highly correlated on time scales greater than around 6 hours.\nResults are presented using ensemble wind power forecasts from several national and international forecast centres (obtained through TIGGE). Firstly, the skill with which global ensemble forecasts can represent the uncertainty in the GB-total power output at up to 10 days ahead is quantified. Following this, novel ensemble forecast metrics are developed to improve estimates of forecast uncertainty within the context of power system operations, thus enabling the development of more cost effective strategies. Finally, the predictability of extreme events such as prolonged low wind periods or rapid changes in wind power output are examined in detail. These events, if poorly forecast, induce high stress scenarios that could threaten the security of the power system.",

            "abstract": "Dryland ecoystems across inland Australia play a key role in the global carbon cycle owing to their extensive distribution and capacity to respond to highly episodic rainfall events. Understanding the pulse-response of vegetation to unpredictable and episodic rainfall also underpins mechanistic models of ecosystem function in dryland regions that can be used to assess vulnerability to altered hydrology, either from groundwater abstraction or climate change. Here, we used high resolution measurements of stem radius to understand diurnal and seasonal patterns of tree water-uptake in response to highly dynamic (cyclone driven) water availability. We also measured leaf water potential and δ2H and δ18O to validate assumptions about pulse water-use and the spatial and vertical distribution of soil water. We tested the hypotheses that (1) stem radius variation follows daily and seasonal patterns that reflect tree water use, and (2) trees are highly responsive to summer cyclone events that recharge the soil profile. We logged changes in stem radius of 11 Eucalyptus victrix trees every 20 minutes from November 2011 – November 2013 in the Hamersley Ranges of NW Australia. Pre-dawn and midday leaf water potential was also measured every three months between November 2011 and November 2012. We found that stem radius followed diurnal patterns of night-time rehydration and daytime water loss associated with transpiration. Periods with the largest Δψ corresponded with the largest measurements on maximum daily shrinkage (MDS) of the stem. Broader seasonal trends in trunk radius related to temperature, rainfall and VPD were also apparent. Rapid and extended periods (days) of stem expansion were associated with rehydration following cyclonic rainfall followed by prolonged periods (months) of gradual contraction associated with depletion of soil moisture. Cyclonic rainfall events had distinct isotopic composition and could be traced in stem water. Similarly, evaporation of moisture from shallow (< 5m) soils during the dry season was reflected in enrichment of 18O in stem water. Future work will couple these data with sap flow measurements to develop an integrated understanding of water and carbon fluxes in eucalypt woodlands of the arid northwest of Australia.",

In the 2050, the water withdrawal will exceed the water which we can get it from the river and underground. One of the ways of alleviating water scarcity is increasing the efficiency of water use without development of additional water supplies. In previous literatures about water use efficiency, there are less discussion about the temporal efficiency change with corresponding characteristics of water resource. The main aim of this paper is to estimate the temporal efficiency of water use during 2011-2020 for proposing how to use efficiently the limited water. This paper used dynamic Data Envelope Analysis to estimate the efficiency which is the ratio of the sum of weighted outputs to the sum of weighted inputs. Our model uses cost of agricultural production as input indices and production value of the agriculture as output index，water withdrawal as temporal linkage. We mainly work on the two problems: Firstly, finding out the evident how much the value of water use efficiencies are in each target country; Secondly, adjusting the output value to make those countries which water use inefficiency reach to DEA efficient. The results provide a scientific reference to make rational allocation and the sustainable use of water resources would be realized.",

            "abstract": "The Rolling Deck to Repository (R2R; http://rvdata.us/) program curates underway environmental sensor data from the U.S. academic oceanographic research fleet, ensuring data sets are routinely and consistently documented, preserved in long-term archives, and disseminated to the science community. Currently 25 in-service vessels contribute 7 terabytes of data to R2R each year, acquired from a full suite of geophysical, oceanographic, meteorological, and navigational sensors on over 400 cruises worldwide.\nTo accommodate this large volume and variety of data, R2R has developed highly efficient stewardship procedures. These include scripted “break out” of cruise data packages from each vessel based on standard filename and directory patterns; automated harvest of cruise metadata from the UNOLS Office via Web Services and from OpenXML-based forms submitted by vessel operators; scripted quality assessment routines that calculate statistical summaries and standard ratings for selected data types; adoption of community-standard controlled vocabularies for vessel codes, instrument types, etc, provided by the NERC Vocabulary Server, in lieu of maintaining custom local term lists; and a standard package structure based on the IETF BagIt format for delivering data to long-term archives. Documentation and standard post-field products, including quality-controlled shiptrack navigation data for every cruise, are published in multiple services and formats to satisfy a diverse range of clients. These include Catalog Service for Web (CSW), GeoRSS, and OAI-PMH discovery services via a GeoNetwork portal; OGC Web Map and Feature Services for GIS clients; a citable Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for each dataset; ISO 19115-2 standard geospatial metadata records suitable for submission to long-term archives as well as the POGO global catalog; and Linked Open Data resources with a SPARQL query endpoint for Semantic Web clients. R2R participates in initiatives such as the Ocean Data Interoperability Platform (ODIP) and the NSF EarthCube OceanLink project to promote community-standard formats, vocabularies, and services among ocean data providers.",

Climate change is about people, about water, and about change itself. Understanding the rate of climate change, relative to the abilities of both humans and ecosystems to adapt is critical. I will briefly describe the multiple, independent lines of evidence that the climate is changing, and that the primary cause of this change is a change in atmospheric composition caused by the burning of fossil fuels. I will cover the history of climate change as seen within the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Navy, how this challenge is being addressed from budgetary, policy, and political angles, and what are the greatest challenges to national security that arise from climate change and in particular, the associated changes in the Arctic. I will conclude with an assessment of future challenges and opportunities regarding climate change, from science, policy, and political perspectives, and why we know enough to take significant action now, even if we don’t know every detail about the future. In addition, this talk will address how to effectively talk about climate change through the use of analogies, plain, non-jargon English, and even a little humor.",

            "abstract": "Large negative carbon (δ13C) and boron (δ11B) isotope excursions (both >6‰) within the widely distributed Neoproterozoic “Snowball Earth” cap carbonates are interpreted as evidence for considerable perturbation of the carbon cycle and the associated reduction, then recovery of global ocean pH. Yet, before conclusive interpretations may be drawn, isotopic data must first be shown to be primary in origin and non-diagenetic. Recent studies of Quaternary carbonate platform sediments from a number of locations worldwide reveal δ13C excursions of similar magnitude and distribution to the “Snowball Earth” excursions. However, these recent analogues were formed following eustatic sea level fall and exposure of recent carbonates to meteoric diagenesis (\nSwart and Kennedy, 2012\n). Here we present δ11B and B/Ca data from Pleistocene-aged carbonate platform sediments recovered by the Clino Core from the Bahamas to examine the effects of diagenesis on the boron system. We find that within the interval of meteoric diagenesis the δ11B of bulk carbonate is substantially reduced by approximately 6‰ in conjunction with a drop in B/Ca of 90%. These isotopic and elemental down-core patterns are strikingly similar to those reported for δ11B and B/Ca in the cap carbonates of the Neoproterozoic snowball Earth events (\nKasemann et al., 2005\n;\nKasemann et al., 2010\n). Our results may therefore question the primary nature of “Snowball Earth” isotope excursions. We recommend more rigorous assessment of the diagenetic history of these ancient carbonates to ensure palaeoclimatological interpretations are robust.",

            "abstract": "Globally distributed paleomagnetic data from archeological artifacts and young volcanics have been combined with those from lacustrine and marine sediments to produce an increasing number of time-varying regularized geomagnetic field models that span the past 10~000 years. The spatial representation is in spherical harmonics while time variations are parameterised as cubic B-splines, and the model regularization is through quadratic norms, often the Ohmic dissipation norm and the 2nd derivative of the time variations. Results are influenced by global distribution and quality of the data and age constraints and by details of the modeling procedure. The latter include relative weighting according to assigned uncertainties, misfit measure (L1 or L2 norm), and outlier rejection. Calibration of relative paleointensity (RPI) observations and relative declinations is also an important issue, and the results are sensitive to the starting model used for initial data calibrations. It is therefore important to ensure that only absolute observations are used in the initial calibration. The most recent Holocene field models have better uncertainty estimates and improved calibration of both relative declination and RPI data, providing better field representations than earlier generations of models.\nOur assessment of Holocene field structure is based on an evaluation of selected models derived from essentially the same dataset as that used to produce the CALS10k.1b model. At Earth's surface robust common features among the various models are a north/south hemispheric asymmetry, with stronger average fields in the northern hemisphere and greater overall variability in the southern hemisphere. Longitudinal structure is also present, with greatest variability in the Atlantic hemisphere, but the signal is not entirely consistent across the various models. Nevertheless at the core-mantle boundary a systematic picture is beginning to emerge of the effects of heterogeneous boundary forcing in the 0-10 ka magnetic field. Correlations with seismic structure in the lowermost mantle are discussed.",

            "abstract": "While ebullition from arctic thermokarst lakes is a globally significant source of CH4 to the atmosphere, to our knowledge, no study has quantified ebullitive emissions from arctic streams. We assessed bubble emissions from an upland stream network (watershed area = 16.84km2) in the Kolyma River region of Northeastern Siberia. We deployed 24 inverted, funnel-type bubble traps along selected reaches of our study streams for the month of July. Ebullition rates were highly variable in both space and time, ranging from 0 – 2.3 L m-2d-1 (mean = 116 mL m-2d-1). Bubbles were enriched with methane, ranging from 1 to 22% mole fraction (mean = 9%) while CO2 mole fractions were relatively low, ranging from <1 – 5% (mean = 2%). Combined, these data resulted in ebullitive fluxes of 3.3 μmol CH4 m-2 d-1 and 0.9 μmol CO2 m-2 d-1. We scaled these results to the entire stream network for the duration of our study using a Monte-Carlo approach that utilized GIS derived stream lengths, measured stream widths, and measured fluxes. From this, we estimate that our study network emitted 66g CO2-C and 270g CH4-C via the ebullition during the month of July. Comparing our results with literature values on ebullitive methane emissions from thermokarst lakes in this and neighboring watersheds, we estimate that streams account for only 0.05 – 0.12% of the total ebullitive methane flux from our watershed during the open-water season (June-September). Further, comparing our results to the four studies published to date on ebullitive emissions from streams (all from temperate regions), we find our rates to be lower by 1-4 orders of magnitude. We hypothesize that upland, arctic stream sediments may not be favorable environments for bubble production as they are cold, relatively dense and contain mostly mineral substrates. Our results highlight both the importance of sediments as a local control on ebullition and the potential for extreme variability in stream ebullition rates at a global scale.",

            "abstract": "Soil microbial communities underpin terrestrial biogeochemical cycles and are greatly influenced by global warming and global-warming-induced dryness. However, the response of soil microbial community function to global change remains largely uncertain, particularly in the ecologically vulnerable Tibetan plateau permafrost area with large carbon storage. With the concept of space for time substitution, we investigated the responses of soil CO2-fixing microbial community and its enzyme activity to climate change along an elevation gradient (4400-5100 m) of alpine grassland on the central Tibetan plateau. The elevation gradient in a south-facing hill slope leads to variation in climate and soil physicochemical parameters. The autotrophic microbial communities were characterized by quantitative PCR (qPCR), terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (T-RFLP) and cloning/sequencing targeting the CO2-fixing gene (RubisCO). The results demonstrated that the autotrophic microbial community abundance, structure and its enzyme activity were mainly driven by soil temperature and water content. Soil temperature increase and water decrease dramatically reduced the abundance of the outnumbered form IC RubisCO-containing microbes, and significantly changed the structure of form IC, IAB and ID RubisCO-containing microbial community. Structural equation model revealed that the RubisCO enzyme was directly derived from RubisCO-containing microbes and its activity was significantly reduced by soil temperature increase and water content decrease. Thus our results provide a novel positive feedback loop of climate warming and warming-induced dryness by that soil microbial carbon fixing potential will reduce by 3.77%-8.86% with the soil temperature increase of 1.94oC and water content decrease of 60%-70%. This positive feedback could be capable of amplifying the climate change given the significant contribution of soil microbial CO2-fixing up to 4.9% of total soil organic carbon.",

            "abstract": "Early warning systems (EWS) are safety-critical IT-infrastructures that serve the purpose of potentially saving lives or assets by observing real-world phenomena and issuing timely warning products to authorities and communities. An EWS consists of sensors, communication networks, data centers, simulation platforms, and dissemination channels. The components of this cyber-physical system may all be affected by both natural hazards and malfunctions of components alike. Resilience engineering so far has mostly been applied to safety-critical systems and processes in transportation (aviation, automobile), construction and medicine. Early warning systems need equivalent techniques to compensate for failures, and furthermore means to adapt to changing threats, emerging technology and research findings. We present threats and pitfalls from our experiences with the German and Indonesian tsunami early warning system, as well as architectural, technological and organizational concepts employed that can enhance an EWS’ resilience.\nThe current EWS is comprised of a multi-type sensor data upstream part, different processing and analysis engines, a decision support system, and various warning dissemination channels. Each subsystem requires a set of approaches towards ensuring stable functionality across system layer boundaries, including also institutional borders. Not only must services be available, but also produce correct results. Most sensors are distributed components with restricted resources, communication channels and power supply. An example for successful resilience engineering is the power capacity based functional management for buoy and tide gauge stations. We discuss various fault-models like cause and effect models on linear pathways, interaction of multiple events, complex and non-linear interaction of assumedly reliable subsystems and fault tolerance means implemented to tackle these threats.",

The SDS acquires data from three sources: NESDIS IDPS (Raw Data Records (RDRs)), GRAVITE (Retained Intermediate Products (RIPs)), and the NOAA/CLASS (higher level products). The SD3E component aggregates the RDRs, and distributes them to each of the PEATEs for further analysis and processing.

            "abstract": "The simulation of unstable invasion patterns in porous media flow is challenging since small perturbations tend to grow in time, so that slight differences in geometry or initial conditions potentially give rise to significantly different solutions. Here we present a detailed comparison of pore scale simulations and experiments of unstable primary drainage in porous micromodels. The porous medium consists of a Hele-Shaw cell containing cylindrical obstacles. Two experimental flow cells have been constructed by soft lithography, with different degrees of heterogeneity in the grain size distribution. To model two-phase flow at the pore scale, we solve Navier-Stokes equations for mass and momentum conservation in the discretized pore space and employ the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method to track the evolution of the interface. During drainage, if the defending fluid is the most viscous, viscous forces destabilize the interface, giving rise to the formation of preferential flow paths, in the form of a branched fingering structure. We test different numerical models (a 2D vertical integrated model and a full 3D model) and different initial conditions, studying their impact on the simulated spatial distributions of the fluid phases. Although due to the unstable nature of the invasion, small discrepancies between the experimental setup and the numerical model can result in different fluids patterns (see figure), simulations show a satisfactory agreement with the structures observed experimentally. To estimate the ability of the numerical approach to reproduce unstable displacement, we compare several quantities in both the statistical and deterministic sense. We demonstrate the impact of three main sources of uncertainty : i) the uncertainty on the pore space geometry, ii) the interface initialization and ii) three dimensional effects [1]. Simulations in weakly heterogeneous geometries are found to be more challenging because uncertainties on pore neck widths are on the same order of magnitude as the pore to pore variability of those widths.\n[1] A.

            "abstract": "We present results of on-going geophysical studies of Caledonian radiothermal granite bodies in Ireland, which are being undertaken to investigate the volumetric depth extent and structural features of these granites. During three field seasons, magnetotelluric (MT) and audio-magnetotelluric (AMT) data were acquired at 156 sites targeting three separate granite bodies. These studies will contribute to a crustal-scale investigation of the geothermal energy potential of the granites and their contribution to the thermal field of the Irish crust.\nAcross the calc-alkaline Galway granite, located on the Irish west coast, MT and AMT data were acquired at 75 sites distributed in a grid. Preliminary 3D inversion reveals the presence of a resistor, thickest beneath the central block of the granite where it extends to depths of 11 – 12 km. The greater depth of the resistor beneath the central block is in contrast to previous thinking that proposed the central block granites to have shallower depth extent than those of the western block, based on Bouguer anomaly maps of the area in which the western block exhibited a more pronounced negative Bouguer anomaly than the central block.\nAt the S-type Leinster granite, in eastern Ireland and to the south of Dublin, MT and AMT data were acquired along two profiles (LGN – 27 sites and LGS – 32 sites). Preliminary 1D inversions of AMT data along profile LGN show the Northern Units of the Leinster granite to extend to a depth of 4.5 km and the Lugnaquilla pluton extending to 2.5 km depth.\nMT and AMT data were acquired at 22 sites along a profile across the buried Kentstown granite, 35 km to the NW of Dublin. The Kentstown granite was intersected by two mineral exploration boreholes at depths of 492 m and 663 m. Preliminary 2D inversions do not yet satisfactorily resolve the top of the buried granite.\nInversion of MT and AMT data is continuing, with the electrical conductivity structures revealed by these inversions being used to constrain inversions of gravity data. The integration of MT and gravity data will provide an insight into the potential density distribution within the resistors associated with the granites and whether the granites, likely to have elevated heat-production (HP), are underlain by electrically resistive but denser, more mafic bodies, likely to be associated with lower HP.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies of high pressure and high temperature experiments indicate that metastable olivine might persist in a cold core of a slab due to the low rate of reaction of olivine to wadsleyite phase transformation. These experimental results correlate with recent seismological observations that a metastable olivine wedge may survive up to a depth of 630 km in the Mariana slab.\nTo study the problem of a non-equilibrium phase transformation in detail, we developed a 2D Cartesian numerical code which incorporates self-consistently transition kinetic effects into a thermo-mechanical convection model. The kinetics of the 410-km olivine to wadsleyite and the 660-km ringwoodite to Pv+Mw phase transformations, including effects of water content at the 410-km phase boundary and latent heat release (respectively absorption), are taken into account.\nThe results show a positive correlation for some of the controlling parameter with respect to the size of the metastable olivine wedge: A thicker and deeper metastable olivine wedge is obtainable by a higher dip angle, a faster subduction velocity, an older slab age, and/or by less water content of the subducting mantle lithosphere. The effects of latent heat release is enhanced with increasing depth; heating of about 100 °C occurs when olivine transforms into wadsleyite at depths deeper than 550 km.\nWe also attempted to explain the recent seismological observations, by calculating the temperature and phase structures in the Mariana slab. Assuming an age of 150 Myr and a subducting velocity of 10 cm/yr for the Mariana slab, a grain-boundary nucleated reaction for the olivine to wadsleyite transformation and a water content of 700 wt. ppm, the metastable olivine wedge survives to a depth of 630 km, which is in good agreement with the seismological observation and available experimental data. This suggests that the Mariana slab is relatively dry.\nFurthermore, assuming that depression of the 660-km discontinuity by ~ 20-30 km within the Mariana slab, which is indicated by seismological observation, is related to the combination of depression caused by negative Clapeyron slope in the cold slab and due to the kinetics of the 660-km phase transformation, we obtain a gentle Clapeyron slope of 0.7 MPa/K for the phase transformation from ringwoodite to Pv+Mw.",

However, their overall contribution is largely unconstrained, partly due to sampling campaigns with short measurement periods and few sampling locations against a backdrop of high spatiotemporal variations in the emissions. Using CH4 emission data from a total of 49 studies, we point out that high-end fluxes that average above 200 mg CH4 m-2 d-1 were measured during sampling intervals of 1 week or less. The range of these short-term fluxes is also twice that of those measured during sampling intervals of 3 months or longer. Further, measurements of small shallow thaw ponds are overrepresented in the literature, which adds error and complexity when scaling CH4 emissions regionally and globally. We use these and other examples to suggest improved sampling strategies that will reduce biases of CH4 emission estimates from high latitude inland waters.",

Within the scope of TERENO (TERrestrial ENvironmental Observatories), four observatories for long-term monitoring of climate change parameters have been established. The observatories are located in areas of Germany that are affected by climate change. SoilCan, a lysimeter-network is part of the TERENO infrastructure which comprises 132 lysimeters of possibly identical technical specification and located at 13 different sites. Primary objectives of SoilCan are:\nCollection of comprehensive long-term data to monitor Global Change on the regional scale.\nGeneration of high-quality data to develop and improve the prognosis of regional climate models with the aim to develop and implement options for management strategies.\nIn the frame of SoilCan, fully automated lysimeter systems were installed on highly equipped experimental field sites within the TERENO-observatories and the relevant status variables of each ecosystem are monitored (e.g. climate, hydrology, biosphere-atmosphere exchange, biodiversity, etc.). The TERENO-observatories are placed in the following four regions of Germany with differing climate conditions.\nThe lysimeters (1.5 m depth, 1m2 surface) were filled with soil monoliths taken at the four TERENO-observatories. In order to capture the expected climate change, 48 lysimeters were transferred along temperature and precipitation gradients within the observatories and/or between the observatories according to the principle „space for time“. The lysimeters are instrumented with high-resolution scales and with TDR, tensiometer, temperature, soil heat flux and CO2 sensors. Suction rakes were installed at the bottom of the lysimeters controlling the lower boundary condition. To observe matter fluxes, soil solution and percolate were collected regularly. The requirements to generate high quality data from weighable lysimeter systems will be presented as well as first results of observed soil nitrogen, carbon and water balances from selected lysimeters.",

            "abstract": "As a consequence of gravitational coupling with their orbital partners, the rotational dynamics of planets and moons exhibits periodic variations in time, such as precession, libration and nutation. Moreover, most planets are subject to tidal forces, which in combination with the planet's rotation, result in a departure from a purely spherically symmetric object. In this theoretical-numerical study, we investigate the flows driven by latitudinal libration (i.e. an oscillation of the figure axis with respect to the mean rotation axis) within liquid cores of triaxial ellipsoidal shape.\nWe first derive a uniform-vorticity solution for the equations of motion, and find that it can resonate with the spin-over inertial mode. Using a reduced model of viscosity (J. Noir and D. Cébron, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 737 (2013)), we deduce that the amplitude of the flow at resonance diverges as the inverse square-root of the Ekman number. Our results are consistent with previous studies in a spheroidal geometry (K. Zhang et al., J. Fluid Mech., vol. 696 (2012)).\nIn a following step, we address the dynamical stability of this uniform-vorticity flow. We show that it is prone to inertial instabilities arising from a parametric resonance between two free inertial modes and the base flow. We also show that the vigor of the instability is governed by the frequency and two parameters that capture the dependence on the libration amplitude and geometry.\nThe resonant nature of these phenomena suggests that libration in latitude, despite its small amplitude, may drive strong flows within planetary cores with possibly major implications for heat transport, dissipation and magnetic field generation/induction. This is discussed at planetary settings for the cores of the Moon, Io and Mercury, and the ancient lunar core.",

            "abstract": "Argo float data obtained from 2003 to 2013 in the North Pacific were analyzed to investigate temporal and spatial variability of the lighter variety of the North Pacific Central Mode Water (CMW) formation. The analysis clearly depicts a wide zonal band of deep winter mixed layer at 34N-39N from the east coast of Japan to the east of the dateline. This zonal band corresponds to the formation region of the lighter variety of CMW (L-CMW; Oka et al., 2011).\nWe examined inter-annual variations of winter mixed layer development and their main causes in the western, central, and eastern parts of the L-CMW formation region, respectively. In the eastern part of the L-CMW formation region, atmospheric forcing such as winter cooling and wind-induced mixing is an important factor of mixed layer deepening. On the other hand, in the western part of the L-CMW formation region, weakened stratification of subsurface associated with anti-cyclonic meso-scale eddies pinched off from the Kuroshio extension is more important. As a result, the L-CMW formation in each year is governed by combination of magnitude of atmospheric forcing in the eastern part and intensity of ocean subsurface stratification in the western part. Meanwhile, summer-time subsurface L-CMW in the subtropical gyre is distributed more widely and thickly when the mixed layer in the previous winter is deeper in the eastern part of formation region. This may imply the subsurface L-CMW in the subtropical gyre is mainly subducted from the eastern part of the formation region.",

We employed field, laboratory and modeling approaches to resolve the impact of (bio)geochemical weathering reactions on the transformation of mine tailings parent materials into soil over the time following mining cessation. Using controlled experiments, we have evaluated the impacts of plants and associated rhizosphere microbiota on these reactions, hydrologic fluxes, and the molecular speciation of mining derived contaminants.

            "abstract": "Faults in shallow, unconsolidated sediment are often associated with aseismic creep, due to the velocity-strengthening behaviour of unconsolidated materials observed during lab experiments. They are expected to appear as broad zones of distributed deformation. However, large seismic ruptures can still propagate to the surface through shallow sediment, causing vast damage and destructive tsunamis. Our understanding of how seismic rupturing of shallow faults in unconsolidated sediment occurs in nature is limited due to the lack of direct observations constraining their structure, deformation patterns and mechanisms, and frictional behaviour.\nWe studied syn-depositional normal faults, which deform unconsolidated, saturated lake sediments of the palaeo-Dead Sea. The sediments belong to the Lisan Formation (~70-18 Ka) and comprise alternating 1-3 mm thick laminae of aragonite and ultrafine-grained detritus. The faults formed at the surface, the only overburden being the overlying water column, and are known to have hosted seismic slip during large events (M ≥ 6), due to their association with seismites. The faults are discrete, localized structures, which sharply truncate laminae in the host sediment. Slip surfaces are sharp and straight and accompanied by a narrow slip zone, up to 1 cm wide, but often ≤ 1 mm wide, containing ultrafine-grained gouge. The majority of slip, up to 3 m, is concentrated in these slip zones. Faults can be categorised as having either simple geometry (one continuous fault strand accommodates all the displacement) or complex geometry (two or more fault segments share the overall displacement). Slip profiles constructed for simple geometry faults all have similar shapes, regardless of maximum displacement, whereas those for complex geometry faults are highly variable, due to segment interaction. It is apparent from the slip profiles that these faults grow and interact in the same way as ‘brittle’ faults in cohesive rocks.\nWe will present results of microstructural analyses of the fault rocks, to constrain the deformation mechanisms occurring during seismic slip in unconsolidated sediment. We will also present results of low- and high-velocity friction experiments, which will constrain the conditions under which brittle deformation and seismic slip occur in these materials.",

            "abstract": "The subpolar spring phytoplankton bloom has important consequences for marine ecosystems and the carbon cycle. The timing of the bloom has been conceived of as a basin-scale event: as the ocean warms, the seasonal mixed layer shoals, restricting phytoplankton to shallower depths and increasing available light to a level at which the bloom can begin. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of localized phenomena in driving the bloom initiation. Specifically, the role of lateral density gradients in generating <10km instabilities in the upper ocean, which then stratify the mixed layer before surface heating begins, has been explored with a process study model and fine-scale observations from a field program to study the North Atlantic spring bloom [1]. However, an alternative hypothesis has recently been validated at both the small scale, using the same observational data [2], and at the basin scale, using remote sensing data [3]. According to this hypothesis, blooms begin when surface heat fluxes weaken, mixing shifts from primarily convectively-driven to primarily wind-driven, and the depth of active mixing in the upper ocean consequently decreases.\nHere, we compare the importance of the barriers to mixing presented by submesoscale instabilities with the decreases in mixing depth caused by changes in surface forcing in driving the initiation of the spring bloom prior to the onset of surface heating. To make this comparison, we use a Lagrangian framework to track the light history of particles seeded in a high-resolution numerical model that we initialize with various surface forcing scenarios, and with and without lateral density gradients. Because the model parameterizes convection with convective adjustment, we present two methodologies to account for turbulent mixing processes that utilize observations of turbulent vertical mixing from a Lagrangian float. We present conclusions on whether and how submesoscale processes affect bloom initiation under varied surface forcing conditions in the context of whether the timing of the subpolar phytoplankton bloom can be thought of as a basin-scale or submesoscale phenomenon.\n[1] A.

Total Mercury (THg) concentration in seawater was systematically measured at different depths from the sea bottom to the surface. A total of 155 surface and deep seawater samples at 25 selected stations were collected during the cruise campaigns using a stainless-steel rosette system on which 24 Niskin bottles (10L) were mounted. Continuous monitoring of temperature, conductivity, salinity and oxygen with depth were obtained by CTD measurements. All fluorinated containers were cleaned prior to use following GMOS SOPs. The chemical reagents used were suitable for ultra-trace Hg analysis. After sampling, samples were preserved by adding HCl solution to the sample bottles, which were refrigerated during transportation and analyzed within four weeks of the end of the oceanographic campaign. Sea water samples were analyzed in the laboratory following the US-EPA 1631 method revision E (US-EPA, 2002). To assess the critical issues related to mercury (Hg) contamination and to prevent leakage of Hg through volatilization we used all necessary precautions for sampling, sample stabilization, preservation and subsequent analysis in the laboratory. Quality assurance and quality control were performed using transport blanks, laboratory blanks and use of seawater certified reference materials. The accuracy of the analytical procedures for the determination of THg in sea water was corroborated by participation in a global inter-laboratory comparison study for THg in natural waters. THg concentrations in surface and deep waters found in the Mediterranean basin during the last two cruise campaigns Med-Oceanor as well as the THg measurements in sea water collected in the other programs and oceanographic campaigns will help to further our understanding of Hg marine distribution and its impact on the biogeochemical cycle of Hg in the open ocean.",

            "abstract": "While the use of ICESat GLAS data is well established for monitoring elevation changes on ice sheets, this data holds valuable information also for more complex terrain and small glaciers, as recently demonstrated for example for high mountain Asia. This study aims at exploring the potential and limitations of ICESat over glaciated, mountainous terrain on the example of Southern Norway.\nThe glaciers in Southern Norway are spread over an area of roughly 100’000 km2 in size. Despite high cloud coverage due to coastal proximity, we found that on average 85% of the laser returns per operational campaign contain valid elevation information from the Earth’s surface, as compared with reference elevations from DEMs of 20m spatial resolution.\nWhile only 1.5% of the study area is glacierised, the laser footprints on ice represent Southern Norway’s glaciers well in elevation, aspect, slope, glacier size, and spatial distribution, even for individual campaigns. With decreasing number of data points towards the end of ICESat’s operational period, relative oversampling of larger ice bodies and spatial clumping occurs. Employing GLAS data for smaller or less glacierised areas might thus lead to a spatial bias due to overrepresentation of a particular glacier, and contrasting mass change estimates compared to traditional mass balance programs that are rather biased towards smaller valley glaciers with different glacier behaviour.\nUsing only data captured at the end of the hydrological year as a proxy for yearly net mass balance, we find a slightly negative glacier surface elevation trend of -0.28 +/- 0.1 m ice per year for the ICESat period 2003 to 2008. This is in accordance with the heterogeneous but overall negative net balance in the range of -0.82 to +0.36 m w.eq. per year obtained by traditional in-situ measurements for ten glaciers in Southern Norway. When including the ICESat winter campaigns, yearly variations in snow height of 50 to 100 cm in the lowlands are accurately represented in particular on ice-free ground. The effect of elevation is reflected in increasing snow depths peaking later in the season for areas above ca. 1500m. Caution should thus be taken when including snow-on data for glacier surface elevation change estimates, as the combined variations are likely to bias the actual glacier signal.",

            "abstract": "Recent research on an agricultural maize canopy has demonstrated that leaf water content can change considerably during the day and in response to water stress. Model simulations suggest that these changes have a significant impact on backscatter, particularly in times of water stress. Radar is already used for several vegetation and soil monitoring applications and might be used for water stress detection in agricultural canopies. Radar observations of the land surface are sensitive because it results in two-way attenuation of the reflected signal from the soil surface, and vegetation contributes to total backscatter from the canopy itself. An important driver that determines the impact of vegetation on backscatter is the dielectric constant of the leaves, which is primarily a function of their moisture content. Understanding the effects of water stress on the dynamics of leaf dielectric properties might shed light on how radar can be used to detect vegetation water stress. Previous studies have investigated the dielectric properties of vegetation. However this has mainly been done using destructive sampling rather than in-vivo measurements. Unfortunately, few in-vivo measurements of vegetation dielectric properties exist. This study presents datasets of in-vivo dielectric measurements of maize leaves, taken during two field experiments. One experiment was done using was done during a period of water stress, the other during a period without. Field measurements revealed a vertical profile in dielectric properties during both the period with and without water stress. During a period of increased water stress, the diurnal dynamics of leaves at different heights responded differently to a decrease in bulk moisture content. This study provides insight in the effect of water stress on vegetation dielectric properties and highlights the potential use of radar for water stress detection in agricultural canopies.",

            "abstract": "We report on the solar phenomena associated with the longitudinal extent of the solar energetic particle (SEP) event observed on 2013 April 11. SEPs were observed over a wide range of heliolongitudes by STEREO and near-Earth spacecraft. We use EUV and white-light coronagraph observations from SDO, SOHO, and STEREO to analyze the angular extent of the EUV and CME-driven shock waves associated with the SEP event. We compare the estimated release time of SEPs observed at each spacecraft with that of the arrival of the CME-associated waves at the footpoints of the magnetic field lines connecting each spacecraft to the solar surface. Whereas the arrival of the EUV wave and CME-driven shock at the footpoint of STEREO-B is consistent, within uncertainties, with the release time of the observed particles, the EUV wave never reached the footpoint of magnetic field lines connecting near-Earth spacecraft to the solar surface even though an intense SEP event was observed there. Modeling of the propagation of the CME-driven shock wave at high coronal altitudes shows that the latter was most likely the source of the particles observed near Earth. The present analysis shows that the angular extent of the EUV wave on the solar surface does not agree with the longitudinal extent of the SEP event in the heliosphere. Hence EUV waves cannot be used consistently as a proxy for the solar phenomena that accelerates and injects energetic particles over broad ranges of longitudes.

            "abstract": "Lateral density variations are the source of mass transport in the Earth at all scales, acting as drivers of convective motion. However, the density structure of the Earth remains largely unknown since classic seismic observables and gravity provide only weak constraints with strong trade-offs. Current density models are therefore often based on velocity scaling, making strong assumptions on the origin of structural heterogeneities, which may not necessarily be correct.\nWe propose to develop a seismic tomography technique that directly inverts for density, using complete seismograms rather than arrival times of certain waves only. The first task in this challenge is to systematically study the imprints of density on synthetic seismograms.\nTo compute the full seismic wavefield in a 3D heterogeneous medium without making significant approximations, we usenumerical wave propagation based on a spectral-element discretization of the seismic wave equation. We consider a 2000 by 1000 km wide and 500 km deep spherical section, with the 1D Earth model PREM (with 40 km crust thickness) as a background. Onto this (in the uppermost 40 km) we superimpose 3D randomly generated velocity and density heterogeneities of various magnitudes and correlation lenghts. We use different random realizations of heterogeneity distribution.\nWe compare the synthetic seismograms for 3D velocity and density structure with 3D velocity structure and with the 1D background, calculating relative amplitude differences and timeshifts as functions of time and frequency.\nOur analyses indicate that reasonably sized density variations within the crust can leave a strong imprint on both traveltimes and amplitudes. This suggests (1) that crustal tomography can be significantly biased when density heterogeneities are not properly accounted for, and (2) that the solution of the seismic inverse problem for density may become feasible.",

The campaign was performed to estimate changes in the radiometric response of the Thermal and Near Infrared Sensor for carbon Observations Fourier Transform Spectrometer (TANSO-FTS) and the Cloud and Aerosol Imager (TANSO-CAI) aboard Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT).\nTANSO-FTS measures spectra of radiance scattered by the Earth surface with high- and medium-gain depending on the surface reflectance. At high reflectance areas, such as deserts over north Africa and Australia, TANSO-FTS collects spectra with medium-gain. There was differences on atmospheric pressure and XCO2 retrieved from spectra obtained between high-gain and medium-gain. Because the retrieved products are useful for evaluating the difference of spectral qualities between high- and medium-gain, this work is an attempt to collect validation data for spectra with medium-gain of TANSO-FTS at remote and desert area with a compact and medium-spectral resolution instrument.\nAs a compact FTS, EM27/SUN was used. It was manufactured and newly released on April 1, 2014 by Bruker. It is robust and operable in a high temperature environment. It was housed in a steel box to protect from dust and rain and powered by Solar panels. It can be operated by such a remote and desert area, like a RRV.\nOver AFRC and RRV, vertical profiles of CO2 and CH4 were measured using the Alpha Jet research aircraft as part of the Alpha Jet Atmospheric eXperiment (AJAX) of ARC, NASA. The values were calibrated to standard gases. To make the results comparable to WMO (World Meteorological Organization) standards, the retrieved XCO2 and XCH4 values are divided by a calibration factor. This values were determined by comparisons with in situ profiles measured by the aircraft. At AFRC it was operated by the side of a ground-based Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) FTS (Bruker IFS 125HR) and the diurnal variation agreed well .\nIn this presentation, we will show results on XCO2 and XCH4 observations made by a compact FTS at AFRC and RRV and comparison of GOSAT and TCCON FTS.",

This interpretation dismisses the previously assessed widespread presence of more felsic materials - as on the Moon’s surface - leaving open the question of the crust petrogenesis of Mercury. Assessing the presence of a differentiated crust on the surface of Mercury is among the intrinsic objectives of the next ESA/JAXA BepiColombo mission to Mercury. The ESA Mercury Planetary Orbiter will carry the Mercury Radiometer and Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (MERTIS, 7-14 µm), which will map the surface mineralogical composition of the planet. The interpretation of spectra collected along a wide range of daily surface temperatures is complicated by the relocation of the band minima depending on the temperature (e.g., Helbert et al. 2013). In addition, the simultaneous presence of different minerals, each one with its characteristic thermal expansion coefficient, results in a more difficult interpretation of the spectra. In this work we examine the spectral variations of linear mixtures of plagioclase and pyroxenes that most likely could be present in the differentiated igneous crust of Mercury, in addition to the T-dependent spectral variations of the single constituents. Furthermore we show how two different thermal expansion coefficients combined in the same sample reveal in a thermal infrared spectrum. To this aim we measure high-T emissivity - up to 725K - of natural binary compositions (e.g., anorthosite, gabbro, norite) and their single-phase components, whose chemistries are provided by microprobe analyses. Besides spectroscopy, all the provided samples are analyzed before and after the heat-treatment using X-Ray Diffraction, in order to verify any possible variation due to the annealing.",

            "abstract": "Recent surveys of medieval era chronicles provide calendar accurate information of years of unusual, extreme weather and climate events in areas surrounding the eastern Mediterranean, between the mid-A.D. 10th century and end of the 11th century. Put together, these documents show that the region was simultaneously afflicted by unprecedented sever and persistent droughts in Egypt's Nile Valley and by unusually cold and dry winters associated with crop failure and loss of pasture areas in present-day Iraq and Iran, and in historical Khurasan. We show that this documentary information is consistent with the annually dated Nile summer flood record as measured at the Cairo Nilometer site and within acceptable dating accuracies with much more coarsely resolved regional paleoclimate proxies. We furthermore note that the timing of these events coincided with the Oort Grand Solar Minimum that reached its peak between A.D. 1040 and 1080. Given the scientific evidence for the impact of solar minima on sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific and how the latter affect the intensity of the African summer monsoon, we argue that the Oort Solar Minimum forced the frequent failure of the Nile summer floods resulting in dearth and famine in Egypt. Furthermore, the simultaneous cold and dry winters in the northern Near East are also consistent with the hypothesized solar minimum influence on the North Atlantic Oscillation and on the intensity of the Siberian High. This interpretation underscores the sensitivity of the climate system to variations in solar irradiance, particularly on multi-decadal time scales, to their role in regional processes, and their impact on human history and may help understand other rapid Mediterranean cooling events that occured during the Holocene.",

            "abstract": "Zones of continent collision form mountain ranges with high topographies and complex geometries. Compressional stresses during ongoing convergence result in crustal thickening and localized deformation, where crustal material is transported and redistributed within the orogen.\nWe use numerical high-resolution thermo-mechanical models to investigate the physical processes of continent collision zones and its implications on rock exhumation. We demonstrate that compression of two continental blocks, separated by a rheologically weak suture zone can result in (i) doubly-vergent (Fig. A) or (ii) single-sided orogens (Fig. B), with distinct geometries, deformation and exhumation patterns. The transition between these different modes of collision is strongly controlled by the rheology of the continental lithosphere and therefore its temperature distribution. Doubly-vergent orogens form at relatively high thermal gradients, while single-sided orogens are typical for lower ones.\nDoubly-vergent orogens (Fig. A) are formed in response to the gradual accretion of crustal material to the upper plate along retro-shears. In these models continental subduction results in upper plate deformation and nested exhumation against retro-shears. Typical examples include the collision recorded by the Swiss Alps and the Pyrenees. In contrast, single-sided orogens are characterized by large-scale lower plate deformation and are accompanied by the subduction of lower crustal material (Fig. B). Modeling infers that shortening and associated exhumation will gradually propagate towards the foreland. In this situation, no significant retro-shear formation is observed, which is in agreement with recent physical modelling studies on deformation of the continental lithosphere [Willingshofer et al., 2013]. Natural examples of such single sided orogens are common in the Mediterranean (Carpathians, Dinarides, Apennines, Betics) or the SE Asia subduction zones.\nWe conclude that deformation and exhumation in continent-continent collision zones may occur in foreland or hinterland settings, depending on the rheological structure of the continental lithosphere, forming single-sided or doubly vergent orogens.",

Increasing δ15N profiles from both sediment cores imply increasing nitrogen availability from the middle Holocene to present. Carbon isotope profiles indicate that algal productivity increased concurrently with nitrogen availability. Nitrogen mass accumulation rates (representing a combination of nitrogen delivery and preservation in the sediment) increase along with productivity, suggesting that the increased flux of nitrogen to the lake lead to increasing lake productivity. Increasing precipitation rather than landscape or lake development processes drove the increased watershed nitrogen flux to these lakes over the late Holocene. We rule out landscape and lake development processes because these lakes have different formation times and processes, and occur in watersheds of different lithologies. One of the lakes also appears to have been nitrogen limited over the Holocene (based on sediment composition and sediment carbon nitrogen ratios) and thus sedimentary δ15N should be similar to δ15N of watershed dissolved nitrogen. Therefore we attribute increasing δ15N over the late Holocene to be caused by soil rather than lacustrine cycling/microbrobial processes.",

            "abstract": "Allanite Th-U-Pb age-dating has recently been found to be powerful in unraveling the timing of geological processes such as the metamorphic dynamics in subduction zones and crystallization velocity of magmas. However, inconsistencies among analytical techniques have raised doubts about the accuracy of allanite age data. Spot analysis techniques such as LA-ICP-MS are claimed to be crucially dependent on matrix-matched standards, the quality of which is variable.\nWe present a new approach in LA-ICP-MS data reduction that allows non-matrix-matched standardization via well constrained zircon reference materials as primary standards. Our data were obtained using a GeoLas Pro 193 nm ArF excimer laser ablation system coupled to an ELAN DRC-e quadrupole ICP-MS. We use 32 µm and 24 µm spot sizes; laser operating conditions of 9 Hz repetition rate and 2.5 J/cm2 fluence have proven advantageous. Matrix dependent downhole fractionation evolution is empirically determined by analyzing 208Pb/232Th and 206Pb/238U and applied prior to standardization. The new data reduction technique was tested on three magmatic allanite reference materials (SISSb, CAPb, TARA); within error these show the same downhole fractionation evolution for all allanite types and in different analytical sessions, provided measurement conditions remain the same. Although the downhole evolution of allanite and zircon differs significantly, a link between zircon and allanite matrix is established by assuming CAPb and TARA to be fixed at the corresponding reference ages. Our weighted mean 208Pb/232Th ages are 30.06 ± 0.22 (2σ) for SISSb, 275.4 ± 1.3 (2σ) for CAPb, and 409.9 ± 1.8 (2σ) for TARA. Precision of single spot age data varies between 1.5 and 8 % (2σ), dependent on spot size and common lead concentrations. Quadrupole LA-ICP-MS allanite age-dating has thus similar uncertainties as do other spot analysis techniques. The new data reduction technique is much less dependent on quality and homogeneity of allanite standard reference materials. This method of correcting for matrix-dependent downhole fractionation evolution opens new possibilities in the field of LA-ICP-MS data acquisition, e.g. the use of a NIST standard glass to date all material types given a set of well constrained reference materials.",

            "abstract": "The alternating land-water surface is a challenging surface to represent accurately in weather and climate models, but it is of great importance for the surface energy balance in polar regions. The complexity of this surface lies in the fact that secondary circulations, which form at the boundary of water and land, interact strongly with the surface energy balance. Due to its large heat capacity, the water temperature adapts slowly to the flow, thus the properties of the atmosphere determine the uptake of energy from the water.\nIn order to study this complex system in a simpler way, retaining only the most essential physics, we have simplified the full surface energy balance including radiation. We have derived a boundary condition that mimics the full balance and can be formulated as a so-called Robin boundary condition: a linear combination of Dirichlet (fixed temperature) and Neumann (fixed temperature gradient) ones. By spatially varying the coefficients, we are able to express land and water using this boundary condition.\nWe have done a series of direct numerical simulations in which we generate artificial land-water patterns from noise created from a Gaussian spectrum centered around a dominant wave number. This method creates realistic random patterns, but we are still in control of the length scales.\nWe show that the system can manifest itself in three regimes: micro-, meso- and macro-scale. In the micro-scale, we find perfect mixing of the near-surface atmosphere that results in identical air properties over water and land. In the meso-scale, secondary circulations alter the heat exchange considerably by advecting air between land and water. In addition, they bring the surface temperature of the land closer to that of the air, thereby modulating the energy loss due to outgoing longwave radiation. In the macro-scale regime, the flow over land and water become independent of each other and only the large scale forcings determine the energy balance.",

To understand the representation of aerosols in China in current global climate models, we evaluate extensively the simulated present-day aerosol concentrations and aerosol optical depth (AOD) over China from the 12 models that participated in Atmospheric Chemistry & Climate Model Intercomparison Project (ACCMIP), by using ground-based measurements and satellite remote sensing. Ground-based measurements of aerosol concentrations used in this work include those from the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) Atmosphere Watch Network (CAWNET) and the observed fine-mode aerosol concentrations collected from the literature. The ground-based measurements of AOD in China are taken from the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET), the sites with CIMEL sun photometer operated by Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and from Chinese Sun Hazemeter Network (CSHNET). We find that the ACCMIP models generally underestimate concentrations of all major aerosol species in China. On an annual mean basis, the multi-model mean concentrations of sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, black carbon, and organic carbon are underestimated by 63%, 73%, 54%, 53%, and 59%, respectively. The multi-model mean AOD values show low biases of 20-40% at studied sites in China. The ACCMIP models can reproduce seasonal variation of nitrate but cannot capture well the seasonal variations of other aerosol species. Our analyses indicate that current global models generally underestimate the role of aerosols in China in climate simulations.",

A deep geological CO2 storage is not expected to leak but potential impacts on groundwater have to be studied. A better understanding on how it could affect groundwater quality, aquifer minerals and trace elements is necessary to characterize a future storage site. Moreover, monitoring and remediation solutions have to be evaluated before storage operations. As part of the ANR project CIPRES, we present here reactive transport works.\n In a 3D model using ToughReact v.2, we perform different CO2 leakage scenarios in a confined aquifer, considering CO2 gas leakage. The model is based on the Albian aquifer, a strategic water resource. It takes into account groundwater and rock chemistry of the Albian green sand layer (Quartz, Glauconite, Kaolinite) at 700 m deep. The geochemical model was elaborated from experimental data. The aquifer consists in a mesh, divided roughly in 20000 cells making a 60 m thick and a 500 m large layer. Furthermore, cells are subdivided near the leakage point to consider local phenomena (secondary precipitation, sorption/desorption...). The chemical model takes into account kinetics for mineral dissolution, ion exchange and surface complexation.\n We highlight the importance of sorption processes on trace element transport (As, Zn and Ni) in fresh groundwater. Moreover, we distinguish different geochemical behavior (CO2 plume shape, secondary precipitation, desorption...) according to different horizontal flow rates influenced by the hydrodynamics (regional gradient). Understanding how geochemical processes and regional flows influence water chemistry, allows to ascertain measurement monitoring and verification plan and remediation works in case of leak considering a given location.",

            "abstract": "Many studies have been undertaken on climate variability analysis in West Africa since the drastic drought recorded at the beginning of the 1970s. The variability highlighted by these studies relies in many cases on different baseline periods chosen with regard to the data available or to the reference periods defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). However, the significance of the change in a time series for a given period is determined from some statistical tests. We develop in this study a statistical method to identify a pertinent reference period for rainfall and temperature variability analysis in the West African Soudano-Sahelian zone. The method is based on an application of three tests of homogeneity in time series and three tests of shift detection in time series. The pertinent reference period is defined as a period of more than 20 years and homogeneous with regard to the main climate parameters (rainfall and temperature).\nThe application of the method on four different gridded climate data from 1901 to 2012 shows that the 1945-1970 period is the longest homogeneous period with regard to the annual rainfall amount. An assessment of the significance of the difference between the confidence interval at the level of 95% around the average during this period and the annual rainfall amounts time series shows that the normal amount is between -10% and +10% of that average. Thus, with regard to that referential period, a wet (dry) year is defined with a surplus (gap) of 10% in the annual rainfall amount above (below) this average. The decadal proportions of wet and dry years reveal that the 1971-1980 period presents the most important number of significant dry years with 1984 as the driest year over the whole 1901-2012 period. The drought periods recorded in the region are mainly characterized by segments of consecutive dry years that had severe impacts on crop production and livestock.\nKey words:  climate variability; climate change; drought; reference period; Soudano-Sahel; West Africa",

To couple the different parts of our system we use the Basic Model Interface (BMI) as developped in the CSDMS community.\nStarting point of the eWaterCycle project was the PCR-GLOBWB model built by Utrecht University. The software behind this model has been partially re-engineered in order to enable it to run in a High Performance Computing (HPC) environment, and to be able to interface using BMI, and run on multiple compute nodes in parallel. The final aim is to have a spatial resolution of 1km x 1km, (currently 10 x 10km).\nFor the data assimilation we make heavy use of the OpenDA system. This allows us to make use of different data assimilation techniques without the need to implement these from scratch. We have developped a BMI adaptor for OpenDA, allowing OpenDA to use any BMI compatible model. As a data assimilation technique we currently use an Ensemble Kalman Filter, and are working on a variant of this technique optimized for HPC environments.\nOne of the next steps in the eWaterCycle project is to couple the model with a hydrodynamic model. Our system will start a localized simulation on demand based on triggers in the global model, giving detailed flow and flood forecasting in support of navigation and disaster management.\nWe will show a live demo of our system, including real-time integration of satellite data.",

The measurements are carried out at Lake Kuivajärvi (Hyytiälä, southern Finland), a small boreal lake (0.63 km2), surrounded by forest. The measurement platform, including the EC system and other auxiliary measurements, is located approximately 1.8 km and 0.8 km from the Northern and Southern shorelines, respectively. Standard quality control criteria were applied and the 30 min fluxes were flagged accordingly (Foken and Wichura, 1996). The steady state test was more effective in removing the CO2 flux than H and LE fluxes, the fraction of non-stationary records being 35%, 7% and 5% respectively. Similarly, the total relative random error (ΔF) for CO2 flux was about twice that estimated for energy fluxes. Median value of random error (δF) for CO2 was 0.14 μmol m-2 s-1, corresponding to 26% of the observed flux. If only 30 min periods with the best quality (flag=0) are included, median values of δF and ΔF were 0.11 μmol m-2 s-1 and 20% respectively, showing that, on average, more conservative flux quality criteria lead to lower flux random uncertainty. The estimated values of ΔF are close to the ones reported in other ecosystems (e.g. Finkeisten and Sims, 2001). However, different diurnal course of random errors was found for energy and CO2 fluxes over the lake and the surrounding forest. The implications on extending standard quality criteria (including also those based on friction velocity, atmospheric stability, etc, which are routinely used for land-based flux towers) to EC flux measurements over freshwater ecosystems are further analysed and discussed.\n",

Moreover, the distribution of atmospheric water vapor is difficult to determine because of its rapid change in spatial and temporal scales. Atmospheric water vapor can be estimated by the zenith delay derived from ground-based GNSS data.\nGround-based GNSS receivers are a valuable source for determining total zenith delay (ZTD) and precipitable water vapor (PW) data for meteorology since they are portable, economic and provide measurements that are not affected by weather conditions. They cannot provide a humidity profile as radiosondes can, however they have the advantage of producing automated continuous data as opposed to operational radiosondes usually providing two measurements in a day. Therefore, tropospheric delay modeling methods for estimating precipitable water vapor using GNSS signals are being developed frequently. Wet and hydrostatic zenith delays can be computed by applying the mapping functions which are mathematical equations using elevation angles. The observed tropospheric delays can be used for monitoring the water vapor content of the troposphere. In several regions of the world GNSS derived products are already used on a routine basis for numerical weather prediction.\nIn this study, PW values obtained from radiosonde profiles and the ones derived from ground-based GNSS data are processed both with BERNESE v5.0 using Niell mapping function and GAMIT/GLOBK using empirical model GPT (Global Pressure and Temperature) are compared with the values computed from radiosonde analysis algorithm under severe storm conditions. In order to convert the ZWD to PW new, locally fitted models are derived using local radiosonde observations and ECMWF model data.",

Groundwater systems are more complex and yet its distribution and quantity are poorly known. The purpose of the research is to evaluate the potential utility of GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellites to monitor groundwater storage in the arid area. Regional groundwater storage changes in SGR are estimated using monthly GRACE total water storage change data. Groundwater storage change estimates are compared to groundwater level measurements of 66 shallow dug wells and 72 deep boreholes for the period 2004-2012. Groundwater storage decreases during the cold season and increases during the warm season. Seasonal groundwater change calculated from GRACE total water storage is highly correlated to groundwater level measurements in shallow aquifers. There is no correlation between groundwater storage changes derived from GRACE and deep aquifer. The result indicates that GRACE can be used to monitor large area where groundwater observation is limited, especially unconfined shallow aquifers.",

            "abstract": "Deformation at shallow crustal depths is dominated by brittle processes, but it is increasingly recognised that diffusive mass transfer (DMT) processes and \"ductile\" folding also play a significant role in fault zone development. We present data from exhumed sections (<5 km depth) of the southern Dead Sea Fault System, Israel, an active continental transform fault that has accumulated 105 km of sinistral displacement since the Miocene. The faults juxtapose various wall rock lithologies (crystalline basement, carbonate and clastic cover), but the studied sections all have phyllosilicate-rich fault cores. Damage zones show a range of deformation mechanisms including pulverisation, pressure-solution and cataclasis.\nOur results show that fault cores comprise three distinct types of fault gouge (alongside coarser-grained cataclasite): cataclastic gouge that is mineralogically similar to wall rock compositions; authigenic gouge that is dominated by Mg-rich smectite not present in adjacent formations; and mechanically entrained, folded shale gouge that is almost identical in mineralogy to a local shale protolith. Microstructural observations suggest authigenic gouge is the result of DMT processes, following an earlier phase of gouge formation through microfracturing and cataclasis. The low abundance of carbonate within fault cores suggests its dissolution is a contributing factor in authigenic smectite precipitation. Such mineralogical transformations may lead to significant changes in the frictional properties of fault zones, from materials of relatively high frictional strength (quartz, feldspars, dolomite, where μ = 0.6 - 0.85) to those with much lower frictional strengths, such as smectite (where μ can be as low as 0.15).\nWe demonstrate how the physical properties of faults may evolve over time when conditions allow precipitation of weak-phases in addition to brittle deformation, which may facilitate ingress of fluid into fault cores and enhance phyllosilicate development. The presence of both pulverisation textures and microfolds suggests interaction of these deformation styles may lead to changes in overall fault behaviour, from velocity-weakening and seismogenic where brittle processes dominate, to velocity-strengthening and aseismic when sufficient weak material has accumulated.",

This work will present high resolution alkenone-derived SST and diatom data from core U1340A collected during IODP Expedition 323. Preliminary results reveal a broad intensification of cold surface water conditions averaging 2-4oC and increased sea ice duration at ca. 0.8-1.1 Ma.

Model calibration is difficult in such systems because the inverse problem is hindered by the discontinuities in the parameter space. In this paper, we present two approaches based on sub-space methods to generate categorical parameter distributions of aquifer parameters that meet calibration constraints (eg:- measured water level data, gradients) while honoring prior geological constraints.\nIn the first approach, the prior geological information and acceptable parameter distributions are encapsulated in a simple object-based model. In the second approach, a Multiple-Point Statistics simulator is used to represent the prior geological information. Sub-space methods in conjunction with dynamic pilot points are then employed to explore the parameter space and determine the parameter combinations that optimally honor geologic and calibration constraints.\nUsing a simple aquifer system, we demonstrate that the new approach is capable of quickly generating multiple multiple parameter distributions that honor both geological and calibration constraints. We also explore the underlying parameter and predictive uncertainty using Null Space Monte Carlo techniques.",

            "abstract": "The trend of stratospheric water vapor during the past decades is not correctly reproduced by current GCMs. This may be due to lack of representation of rapid water transfers from troposphere to stratosphere. Our modeling study focused on a particular case of tropical very deep convection, a Hector thunderstorm observed on 30 November 2005 over Tiwi Islands, Australia, during the SCOUT-O3 field campaign. Plumes of ice particles reaching 19 km altitude were measured by lidar aboard the Geophysica stratospheric aircraft. We performed a Giga-Large-Eddy Simulation of Hector (100 m horizontal resolution) using cutting-edge computing resources, as well as a series of simulations with coarser horizontal resolutions, from 200 m to 1600 m. Strong morning sea breeze deviated boundary layer westerlies and led to intense convergence of humid air over Tiwi Islands. Deep convection triggered around 1 pm. The most intense upward transport started straight after and lasted around 2 hours. Updraft cores statistics showed that stronger upward winds in the boundary layer and at the cloud base lead to weaker cloud fraction aloft and higher hydrometeor content in updraft cores. Turbulence analysis also showed that the faster the updrafts are, the lower the dilution and the more efficient the vertical transfer of water. As a result, some updrafts overshooted the tropopause and carried ice crystals in the stratosphere. Overshoots in the Giga-LES compared well with the observations. Part of the ice particles precipitated then whereas the remainder sublimated in lower stratosphere. The consequent vapour pockets were transported and diluted within the stratosphere by easterlies. In total, 2776 tonnes of water were transported from troposphere to stratosphere. Associated net hydration of the lower stratosphere was found with a 16 % increase in water vapour. Upscaling this result using 5-year TRMM radar observations we found that deep convection penetrating 380 K potential temperature level could represent 18 % of troposphere-stratosphere total water flux. While moistening appeared to be robust with respect to the grid spacing used, grid spacing on the order of 100 m may be necessary for a reliable estimate of hydration. This study was supported by the StratoClim project.",

            "abstract": "Receiver function analysis is very useful tool to image the seismic velocity structures. We apply it to image seismic structure beneath Kyushu island, Japan. Kyushu region is characterized by active subduction of the Philippine Sea plate (PHS) beneath the Eurasian plate and many active volcanoes. In this study, we use teleseismic records from Hi-net seismic stations (borehole stations) and F-net stations (near-surface stations) in Kyushu, which are supplied by the NIED. Because most of these seismic stations are located at the top or in the sedimentary layer, the records may include strong effect of reverberation within the sedimentary layer, and this effect makes the image of the structure unclear. To overcome this problem, we exploit the modified S-wavevector receiver functions (SWV-RFs). The SWV-RFs are derived by deconvolving the upgoing S-wave component with the upgoing P-wave component of the records. Although it was originally proposed for surface records by Reading et al. (2003, GRL), we use Takenaka and Murakoshi's (2010) method in which we virtually move the seismic sensor at the surface or in the borehole down to the top of the basement layer and calculate the SWV-RFs at that location for suppressing the sedimentary layer effect. This method needs the structure model from the surface to the virtual sensor location. Here we apply the Integrated Velocity Structure Model by the Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion. We take several cross sections in Kyushu Island to map the calculated SWV-RFs. We then interpret the continental Moho and low velocity zones in the SWV-RFs. The Moho depth beneath Kyushu varies from 25 km to 33 km. We found two types of exceptional occurrence of 'inverted' Moho (IM): one is the top of sill-like low velocity zones just under active volcanoes, and the other is non-sill type events beneath fore-arc regions of northern Kyushu, which may be attributed to dehydration of PHS. The latter-type IM has been observed by Abe et al. (2013, JGR), while, to our knowledge, the former type IM have been imaged by us for the first time. We further model some SWVRF sections by the 2.5D finite-difference method [Takenaka and Okamoto, 2012, InTech]: we confirm that the assumed depths of Moho and sill-like low velocity zones in the simulation model are well reproduced in the simulated RF imaging results.",

            "abstract": "The critical zone (CZ) is characterized by the duality between mass transport processes such as diffusion and flow of gases, fluids, and solids and localized bio-geochemical interactions especially linked to the “immobile” capillary/adsorbed water. Open questions are towards the role of capillarity onto reactive mechanisms: is there a geochemical signature of capillary water that can change the bio-geochemical balance? The research efforts focused on this issue to develop modeling tools integrating capillary effects at the soil-profile or CZ scale.\nWater suction gains geochemical significance when ranging from 20 to 200 MPa, meaning high tension and low amount of stretched water with its specific thermophysical properties (Mercury and Tardy, 2001; Mercury et al., 2003; 2004; Pettenati et al., 2008). Therefore, our interest is directed to the dry end of the water retention curve (WRC). The recent model from Silva and Grifoll (2007) proposed a full-range soil-water retention functions, extending the description to the adsorbed films down to the monolayer thickness. At this stage, it becomes possible to evaluate the role of both capillary pockets and adsorbed films at all water content in the geochemical dynamics of non-saturated soils. We developed from that point by fitting the WRC not through a continuous porous network, but through a decomposition into two porous domains (immobile/mobile domains), each with its own potential-water content law. This amounts to treat the WRC according to an intrinsic dual porosity scheme, and make easier to involve chemical effects at each potential-water content couple.\nA simple test simulation is developed with calcite rock kinetically interacting with immobile and mobile water, themselves connected by diffusive and advective gradients in the limits of the immobile-mobile contact area. The reactive transport simulations are run with HP1 (Jacques and Šimůnek, 2005). The mass balance exporting toward groundwater is calculated with and without capillary effects, according to a wide range of conditions (climate, recharge rate, water potential in each domain, etc). It demonstrates how the capillary component acts on the chemical dynamics at the CZ scale.\n Keywords: critical zone, unsaturated zone, capillarity, reactive transport modeling,“stretched water”.",

            "abstract": "A common assumption is that the modern day continental Si cycle is at steady-state. However, a new paradigm is emerging regarding the terrestrial biogeochemical Si cycle and its importance. We now know that the terrestrial Si cycle is strongly biologically mediated, which creates and recycles a pool of reactive Si in soils and sediments that ultimately buffers the export of dissolved silicate (DSi) to the oceans. Our recent results show that imbalances in the continental Si pool on millennial scales may have caused systematic mis-estimation of silicate weathering rates, particularly when using river chemistry at large spatial scales to calculate weathering rates. Quantifying this imbalance is essential to understand ocean-terrestrial biogeochemical interactions. On short (human) timescales large-scale changes in land cover, erosion and eutrophication have significantly altered the fluvial flux of Si. Likewise, periods of glacial-interglacial transitions produce new weathering products from the continents with subsequent impacts on oceanic DSi. Over still longer timescales significant changes in fluvial Si fluxes have probably occurred with large-scale changes in chemical weathering due to orogeny, climate change, the emplacement of large igneous provinces, or changes in volcanic activity. We will discuss the timescale dependency of processes and the assumption of steady state. In addition, we will examine how a changing terrestrial Si cycle impacts the ocean Si cycle. Finally, we will address unresolved questions regarding the delivery of Si to the oceans from the continents.",

            "abstract": "When the sun rises in the Arctic spring, photolytically active halogen species (Cl2, Br2, and I2, and interhalogens) are released into the lower atmosphere, causing episodic depletions of boundary layer ozone. These Arctic ozone depletion events (ODEs) have been primarily studied from coastal sites; however, a recent series of deployments of autonomous, sea-ice tethered instrumented observatories (O-Buoys) has allowed for \"long\"-term, in-situ examination of ODEs from the frozen Arctic Ocean surface. These Arctic Ocean measurements can help address what effects prevailing local sea ice conditions have on the timing, frequency, and duration of ozone depletion, and if there exists a particular Arctic Ocean event source region. In this study, we compare Arctic Ocean-based and coastal measurements of ozone, radiation, and meteorological parameters from March through June in 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2014, as they pertain to ODEs, as well as with sea ice conditions derived from satellite observations. A backward air mass trajectory study was also performed to trace the history of ozone-depleted air masses. We subsequently compared these trajectories with satellite bromine monoxide and sea ice observations to probe locations for bromine activation. Here we present and discuss the results of these investigations.",

            "abstract": "Earth system models provide us with an opportunity to examine the complex interactions and feedbacks between land surface, vegetation and atmosphere. A more thorough understanding of these interactions is essential in reducing uncertainty surrounding the potential impacts of climate and environmental change on the future state and extent of the Amazon rainforest. This forest is a important resource for the region and globally in terms of ecosystem services, hydrology and biodiversity.\nWe aim to investigate the effect of CO2 physiological forcing on the Amazon rainforest and its feedback on regional climate by using the CMIP5 idealised 1% CO2 simulations with a focus on HadGEM2-ES. In these simulations, the atmospheric CO2 concentration is increased by 1% per year for 140 years, reaching around 1150ppm at the end of the simulation. The use of idealised simulations allows the effect of CO2 to be separated from other forcings and the sensitivities to be quantified. In particular, it enables non-linear feedbacks to be identified.\nIn addition to the fully coupled 1% CO2 simulation, in which all schemes respond to the forcing, we use simulations in which (a) only the biochemistry scheme sees the rising CO2 concentration, and (b) in which rising CO2 is only seen by the radiation scheme. With these simulations we examine the degree to which CO2 effects are additive or non-linear when in combination. We also show regional differences in climate and vegetation response, highlighting areas of increased sensitivity.",

            "abstract": "The spatial scale of the atmospheric gravity wave in the mesosphere and the lower thermosphere was analyzed using the simultaneous observational data of ISS-IMAP and an all-sky imager at Hawaii. There are a plenty of previous studies that discuss the relationship between the wave structures of the mesospheric airglow and the tropospheric events. The problem of the ground-based observation of the airglow is that it cannot distinguish spatial variations from temporal variations for the structures whose scale size is larger than its field-of-view. ISS-IMAP started the observation in October, 2012 to survey the atmospheric gravity waves whose horizontal scale size is 50 km and longer. The spatial resolution of the VIsible-light and infrared Spectrum Imager (VISI) of ISS-IMAP/VISI imaging observation is from 10 km to 25 km. Simultaneous observations start from March 14, 2013. The atmospheric gravity waves that detected by VISI in 762 nm were compared with the observations of ground-based all-sky imagers in 557.7 nm. The generation and the propagation of the atmospheric gravity waves were investigated with this simultaneous observation. The relationship between the tropospheric events and the atmospheric gravity waves in the mesosphere is studied with the wide field-of-view observation by VISI/ISS-IMAP, and the continuous observation of the ground-based imagers. VISI frequently observed wave packets whose scale size is 1,000-2,000 km. These wave packets were observed by the ground-based imager as a series of waves whose wave length is 20-40 km, and that continue for 5-6 hours. The generation, the propagation and the distraction of the atmospheric gravity waves will be discussed in this presentation.",

            "abstract": "Much of the carbon assimilated by plants during photosynthesis is lost to the soil via rhizodepositions. One component of rhizopdeposition is mucilage, a hydrogel that dramatically alters the soil physical properties. Mucilage was assumed to explain unexpectedly low rhizosphere rewetting rates during irrigation (Carminati et al. 2010) and temporarily water repellency in the rhizosphere after severe drying (Moradi et al. 2012).\nHere, we present an experimental and theoretical study for the rewetting behaviour of a soil mixed with mucilage, which was used as an analogue of the rhizosphere. Our samples were made of two layers of untreated soils separated by a thin layer (ca. 1 mm) of soil treated with mucilage. We prepared soil columns of varying particle size, mucilage concentration and height of the middle layer above the water table. The dry soil columns were re-wetted by capillary rise from the bottom.\nThe rewetting of the middle layer showed a distinct dual behavior. For mucilage concentrations lower than a certain threshold, water could cross the thin layer almost immediately after rewetting of bulk soil. At slightly higher mucilage concentrations, the thin layer was almost impermeable. The mucilage concentration at the threshold strongly depended on particle size: the smaller the particle size the larger the soil specific surface and the more mucilage was needed to cover the entire particle surface and to induce water repellency.\nWe applied a classic pore network model to simulate the experimental observations. In the model a certain fraction of nodes were randomly disconnected to reproduce the effect of mucilage in temporarily blocking the flow. The percolation model could qualitatively reproduce well the threshold characteristics of the experiments.\nOur experiments, together with former observations of water dynamics in the rhizosphere, suggest that the rhizosphere is near the percolation threshold, where small variations in mucilage concentration sensitively alter the soil hydraulic conductivity. Is mucilage exudation a plant mechanism to efficiently control the rhizosphere conductivity and the access to water?",

However, little is known about the magnitude of seepage, the fate of this methane once it enters the water column, or the bacteria that may consume it. In July 2014, water column methane concentrations were measured throughout Hudson Canyon and methane oxidation tracked using a 13C-methane tracer. Samples for microbial community composition analysis were collected throughout the water column in areas with and without active seepage. 16S rRNA gene sequencing will be used to compare microbial communities from different depths, locations, and in samples with low and high methane concentrations and oxidation rates. DNA stable isotope probing experiments with 13C-labeled methane were also conducted and will be used to detect active water column methanotrophs from seep and non-seep sites. In addition, mesocosm experiments were used for high resolution measurements of methane oxidation, with samples for microbial community composition taken at several time points. 16S rRNA gene sequencing will be used to track changes in methanotrophic bacteria and the overall microbial community as methane was consumed.",

            "abstract": "Over recent years, long-term climate forecast from global circulation models (GCMs) has been demonstrated to show increasing skills over the climatology, thanks to the advances in the modelling of coupled ocean-atmosphere dynamics. Improved information from long-term forecast is supposed to be a valuable support to farmers in optimizing farming operations (e.g. crop choice, cropping time) and for more effectively coping with the adverse impacts of climate variability. Yet, evaluating how valuable this information can be is not straightforward and farmers’ response must be taken into consideration. Indeed, while long-range forecast are traditionally evaluated in terms of accuracy by comparison of hindcast and observed values, in the context of agricultural systems, potentially useful forecast information should alter the stakeholders’ expectation, modify their decisions and ultimately have an impact on their annual benefit. Therefore, it is more desirable to assess the value of those long-term forecasts via decision-making models so as to extract direct indication of probable decision outcomes from farmers, i.e. from an end-to-end perspective.\nIn this work, we evaluate the operational value of thirteen state-of-the-art long-range forecast ensembles against climatology forecast and subjective prediction (i.e. past year climate and historical average) within an integrated agronomic modeling framework embedding an implicit model of farmers’ behavior. Collected ensemble datasets are bias-corrected and downscaled using a stochastic weather generator, in order to address the mismatch of the spatio-temporal scale between forecast data from GCMs and distributed crop simulation model. The agronomic model is first simulated using the forecast information (ex-ante), followed by a second run with actual climate (ex-post). Multi-year simulations are performed to account for climate variability and the value of the different climate forecast is evaluated against the perfect foresight scenario based on the expected crop productivity as well as the land-use decisions.\nOur results show that not all the products generate beneficial effects to farmers and that the forecast errors might be amplified by the farmers decisions.",

            "abstract": "One of the critical tenets of physical petrology is that chemical processes cannot be considered in isolation from the physical properties and history of the magma. Particularly through the development of the solidification front framework, we recognize the fundamental significance of isotherm propagation through a magma body as the governing control on crystallization. Except in experimental simulations and certain fortuitous natural examples, the primary data we have to reconstruct the thermal evolution of a magma body is the texture of the rock.\nWe have measured crystal sizes of oxide minerals (primarily magnetite) from a thin (1.4 m), compositionally uniform, diabase sill to better characterize the relationship between thermal history and rock texture. In the outer 30 cm of the sill (upper and lower margins), crystal sizes increase from ~2 to ~9 µm, and then remain nearly uniform at 9.5(±1.5) µm through the central 80 cm. There is significant alteration in the lowermost 15 cm of the sill, which has largely obliterated the original oxide textures, but otherwise the textural profile is remarkably symmetrical, indicating that cooling occurred by simple conduction through the upper and lower margins. Reasonable cooling models, coupled with a simple linear crystal growth model, generate theoretical textural profiles that closely resemble the measured profile. The parameters of the growth model are consistent with experimental and observational data from a wide range of igneous bodies.\nWe suggest that the observed crystal size variations in this thin sill can be considered a type example of a simple dike or sill in which there were no phenocrysts intruded with the magma, no significant redistribution of crystals during cooling, and simple conductive cooling through the margins. Our results can be used as an example of the extent and pattern of textural variations that can be expected in a simple intrusion, and thus a null hypothesis for proposed complex intrusions.",

            "abstract": "Campi Flegrei (CF) is a densely urbanized caldera with a very high volcanic risk. Its more recent volcanic activity was characterized in the last 15 kyrs by more than 70 explosive events of variable scale and vent location. The sequence of eruptive events at CF is remarkably inhomogeneous, both in space and time. Eruptions concentred over periods from a few centuries to a few millennia, and were alternated by periods of quiescence lasting up to several millennia. As a consequence, activity has been subdivided into three distinct epochs, i.e. Epoch I, 15 - 9.5 kyrs, Epoch II, 8.6 - 8.2 kyrs, and Epoch III, 4.8 - 3.7 kyrs BP [e.g. Orsi et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2011]. The eruptive record also shows the presence of clusters of events in space-time, i.e. the opening of a new vent in a particular location and at a specific time seems to increase the probability of another vent opening in the nearby area and in the next decades-centuries (self-exciting effect). Probabilistic vent opening mapping conditional the occurrence of a new event and able to account for some of the intrinsic uncertainties affecting the system, has been investigated in some recent studies [e.g. Selva et al. 2011, Bevilacqua et al. 2014, in preparation], but a spatial-temporal model of the sequence of volcanic activity remains an open issue. Hence we have developed a time-space mathematical model that takes into account both the self-exciting behaviour of the system and the significant uncertainty affecting the eruptive record. Based on the past eruptive record of the volcano, the model allows to simulate sequences of future events as well as to better understand the spatial and temporal evolution of the system. In addition, based on the assumption that the last eruptive event occurred in 1538 AD (Monte Nuovo eruption) is the first event of a new epoch of activity, the model can estimate the probability of new vent opening at CF in the next decades.",

            "abstract": "The rotation of tectonic plates and basins is not uncommon in the Western Pacific. However, determining the exact amount of rotation over geological time can be quite challenging, especially for the Philippine Sea and Caroline Plates, because paleomagnetic measurements are rare and even if they exist come from sites near the plate boundary which may have suffered local tectonic deformations. Although it is generally thought that the Philippine Sea Plate rotated 90° clockwise during the last 55 Ma and that Caroline Plate likewise began to rotate soon after its formation around 32 Ma, there is no direct evidence for such arguments. While the recent IODP drilling (Leg 351) of the Amami-Sankaku Basin in the northern tip of the West Philippine Basin promises to provide an opportunity to estimate the rotation of the Philippine Sea Plate, in practice, the collection and subsequent reduction of borehole magnetic field data can be quite complicated. Moreover, if the magnetization intensity is low, which is the case for sediments, it is difficult to assess the outcome of magnetic field investigations. Hence, it is important to have the capability to compare the observation with model simulation readily. In this paper, we present magnetic field simulations within the borehole using the analytical methods outlined by Bosum and others (1988) which assumes a circular borehole within uniformly magnetized strata layers and Gallet and Courtilot (1989) which can accommodate inclined layers. The methods are applied to the Philippine Sea Plate and Caroline Plate using geological parameters whose values are derived from previous kinematic models.

            "abstract": "Most of the subsidence in the Houston-Galveston region, Texas, has occurred as a direct result of groundwater withdrawals for municipal supply, commercial and industrial use, and irrigation that depressured and dewatered the Chicot and Evangeline aquifers, thereby causing compaction mostly in the clay and silt layers of the aquifer sediments. In 2013, water-level-altitude contours for the Chicot aquifer ranged from 200 feet (ft) below North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (hereinafter, datum) in a small area in southwestern Harris County to 200 ft above datum in central to west-central Montgomery County. Contoured 5-year and long-term changes in water levels in the Chicot aquifer ranged from a 30-ft decline to an 80-ft rise (2008–13), from a 120-ft decline to a 100-ft rise (1990–2013), and from an 80-ft decline to a 200-ft rise (1977–2013). In 2013, water-level-altitude contours for the Evangeline aquifer ranged from 300 ft below datum in south-central Montgomery County to 200 ft above datum in southeastern Grimes and northwestern Montgomery Counties. Contoured 5-year and long-term changes in water levels in the Evangeline aquifer ranged from an 80-ft decline to an 80-ft rise (2008–13), from a 220-ft decline to a 220-ft rise (1990–2013), and from a 360-ft decline to a 260-ft rise (1977–2013). In 2013, water-level-altitude contours for the Jasper aquifer ranged from 200 ft below datum in south-central Montgomery and north-central Harris Counties to 250 ft above datum in northwestern Montgomery County and extending into northeastern Grimes and south-central Walker Counties. Contoured changes in water levels in the Jasper aquifer ranged from a 100-ft decline to 20-ft rise (2008–13) and from a 220-ft decline to no change (2000–13). Compaction of subsurface sediments of the Chicot and Evangeline aquifers was recorded continuously by 13 borehole extensometers. For the period of record beginning in 1973–2012, cumulative measured compaction ranged from 0.100 ft at the Texas City-Moses Lake extensometer to 3.632 ft at the Addicks extensometer. The rate of compaction varies from site to site because of differences in groundwater withdrawals near each site and differences among sites in the clay-to-sand ratio and compressibility in the subsurface sediments. Therefore, compaction rates are unique for each extensometer site.",

            "abstract": "The National Seismic Hazard Maps for Japan, which consist of probabilistic seismic hazard maps (PSHMs) and scenario earthquake shaking maps (SESMs), have been published every year since 2005 by the Earthquake Research Committee (ERC) in the Headquarter for Earthquake Research Promotion, which was established in the Japanese government after the 1995 Kobe earthquake. The publication was interrupted due to problems in the PSHMs revealed by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, and the Subcommittee for Evaluations of Strong Ground Motions (‘Subcommittee’) has been examining the problems for two and a half years (ERC, 2013; Fujiwara, 2014). However, the SESMs and the broadband ground motion simulation recipe used in them are still valid at least for crustal earthquakes. Here, we outline this recipe and show the results of validation tests for it.\nIrikura and Miyake (2001) and Irikura (2004) developed a recipe for simulating strong ground motions from future crustal earthquakes based on a characterization of their source models (Irikura recipe). The result of the characterization is called a characterized source model, where a rectangular fault includes a few rectangular asperities. Each asperity and the background area surrounding the asperities have their own uniform stress drops. The Irikura recipe defines the parameters of the fault and asperities, and how to simulate broadband ground motions from the characterized source model. The recipe for the SESMs was constructed following the Irikura recipe (ERC, 2005). The National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED) then made simulation codes along this recipe to generate SESMs (Fujiwara et al., 2006; Morikawa et al., 2011).  \nThe Subcommittee in 2002 validated a preliminary version of the SESM recipe by comparing simulated and observed ground motions for the 2000 Tottori earthquake. In 2007 and 2008, the Subcommittee carried out detailed validations of the current version of the SESM recipe and the NIED codes using ground motions from the 2005 Fukuoka earthquake. Irikura and Miyake (2011) summarized the latter validations, concluding that the ground motions were successfully simulated as shown in the figure. This indicates that the recipe has enough potential to generate broadband ground motions for scenario hazard assessment in Japan.",

Here we present data acquired during the first observations of the comet, starting from mid-July 2014, when the spacecraft-target distance was approximately 13000 km and the comet nucleus as seen by the instrument was pixel-size, up to the more recent acquisitions in which the surface was resolved. These far-approach data have allowed us to produce both light curves of the nucleus at different solar phase angles and disk-integrated phase curves over the entire instrument spectral range. The light curve is characterized by two asymmetric peaks due to the elongated, e.g. double-lobed, shape of the nucleus. The disk-integrated phase curves exhibit a back-scattering behavior. Comparisons with light curves and phase curves of other comets will be discussed, as well as the dependence of color ratios on rotational phase and phase angle in order to exploit surface compositional variations. We also present a retrieval of the main photometric parameters (single scattering albedo, surface roughness, single particle phase function and opposition effect width and amplitude) by means of Hapke model.\nAuthors acknowledge the funding from Italian and French Space Agencies.",

A fact that nearly 80% of Indian farmers are smallholders, who merely own a third of total farmlands and belong to the poorest quartile, but produce nearly 40% of countries foodgrains underlines the importance of understanding the socio-hydrology of a small holder.\nWe present a framework to understand the socio-hydrological system dynamics of a small holder. It couples the dynamics of 6 main variables that are most relevant at the scale of a small holder: local storage (soil moisture and other water storage), capital, knowledge, livestock production, soil fertility and grass biomass production. The model incorporates rule-based adaptation mechanisms (for example: adjusting expenditures on food and fertilizers, selling livestocks etc.) of small holders when they face adverse socio-hydrological conditions, such as low annual rainfall, higher intra-annual variability in rainfall or variability in agricultural prices. It allows us to study sustainability of small holder farming systems under various settings.\nWe apply the framework to understand the socio-hydrology of small holders in Aurangabad, Maharashtra, India. This district has witnessed suicides of many sugarcane farmers who could not extricate themselves out of the debt trap. These farmers lack irrigation and are susceptible to fluctuating sugar prices and intra-annual hydroclimatic variability. This presentation discusses two aspects in particular: whether government interventions to absolve the debt of farmers is enough and what is the value of investing in local storages that can buffer intra-annual variability in rainfall and strengthening the safety-nets either by creating opportunities for alternative sources of income or by crop diversification.",

            "abstract": "Hot mantle plumes ascending from the core-mantle boundary experience a filtering effect by the endothermic phase change at the 660-km discontinuity. Fluid dynamics predicts that some hot mantle plumes stagnate at the phase boundary and locally heat the bottom of the upper mantle. This generates the secondary plumes in the upper mantle originating hotspots volcanic activities on the Earth’s surface. Recently, seismic tomographic images around the upper-lower mantle boundary showed that the horizontal scale of the low velocity regions, which corresponds to that of the thermally buoyant heat sources, is the order of 100-1000 km. Although most of the fluid dynamic theories on the thermal plumes have been developed using an assumption that the heat source effect is negligible, the behaviors of the starting plumes in the upper mantle should depend on the size of heat source, which is generated by the hotter plume from the CMB. In order to understand the effects of heater size on the starting plume generation, we have experimentally investigated the behaviors of thermally buoyant plumes using a localized heat source (circular plate heater). The combination of quantitative visualization techniques of temperature (Thermochromic Liquid Crystals) and velocity (Particle Image Velocimetry) fields reveals the transient nature of the plume evolution: a variety of the spatio-tempotal distribution of plumes. Simple scaling laws for their ascent velocity and spacing of the plumes are experimentally determined. We also estimate the onset time of the secondary plumes in the upper mantle which depends on the local characteristics of the thermal boundary layer developing at the upper-lower mantle boundary.",

            "abstract": "The capacity of the world ocean to transfer heat to deeper levels is a crucial factor in setting the magnitude and temporal evolution of the global temperature response under transient climate change. A traditional framework to discuss the vertical ocean heat balance is the classic upwelling-diffusive model of Munk [1966] between upwelling of cold abyssal waters and downward diffusion of warm waters. This simple framework is also often used to interpret (and predict) transient heat uptake under climate change. However, this is done in an ad-hoc manner, with little acknowledgment of the complex physics hidden behind the vertical velocity w and diffusivity kν of the classic model (advection of heat by the mean and eddy circulation, diffusion along and across surfaces of constant density, deep convection). Here, we derive an effective vertical velocity and an effective diffusivity for each advective and diffusive process from the steady-state temperature tendencies of two models, an eddy-parameterizing (HadCM3) and an eddy-permitting climate model (HiGEM). For both models, we find that both the effective vertical velocity and diffusivity change sign in mid-depth, highlighting the two physical regimes in which the residual advection is balanced by diapycnal diffusion (deep ocean) and isopycnal diffusion (upper to mid-depths). These findings are at odds with common practices which assume that w and kν are positive constants (in space and time), but is consistent with previous studies of the modeled heat balance. We further present the time-evolution of the effective quantities under an idealized transient climate change simulation. We demonstrate that these spatial and time variations are key to evaluate the transient heat uptake. Implications for the use of simple upwelling-diffusive models to interpret transient heat uptake will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Possibly the leading complication for users of climate information for policy and adaptation is the confusing mix of contrasting data sets that offer widely differing (and often times fundamentally contradictory) indications of the magnitude and direction of past and future regional climate change. In this light, the most pressing scientific-societal challenge is the need to find new ways to understand the sources of conflicting messages from multi-model, multi-method and multi-scale disparities, to develop and implement new analytical methodologies to address this difficulty and so to advance the interpretation and communication of robust climate information to decision makers. Compounding this challenge is the growth of climate services which, in view of the confusing mix of climate change messages, raises serious concerns as to the ethics of communication and dissemination of regional climate change data.\nThe Working Group on Regional Climate (WGRC) of the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) oversees the CORDEX downscaling program which offers a systematic approach to compare the CMIP5 GCMs alongside RCMs and Empirical-statistical (ESD) downscaling within a common experimental design, and which facilitates the evaluation and assessment of the relative information content and sources of error. Using results from the CORDEX RCM and ESD evaluation experiment, and set against the regional messages from the CMIP5 GCMs, we examine the differing messages that arise from each data source. These are then considered in terms of the implications of consequence if each data source were to be independently adopted in a real world use-case scenario. This is then cast in the context of the emerging developments on the distillation dilemma - where the pressing need is for multi-method integration - and how this relates to the WCRP regional research grand challenges.",

            "abstract": "Flat slabs are ubiquitous today and in Earth's past, present in at least 10% of present-day subduction zones. The Nazca slab is a classic example with large dip variations along strike, including two prominent flat segments in Peru and Argentina that coincide with the subduction of aseismic ridges. The origin of flat segments remain enigmatic though much work has examined the consequences for upper plate deformation and continued subduction. In the case of the Argentinian flat segment, detailed seismic imaging has shown significantly increased crustal thickness in the flat part of the slab. Our present understanding of oceanic crust formation suggests that incrased crustal thickness forms in response to larger degrees of partial melt, which in turn decrease the water content of the formed crust. The residuum from this process is depleted. The resulting combined lithospheric column is buoyant with respect to the underlying mantle, and likely cold from its contact with the overlying plate and unlikely to undergo the basalt-eclogite transition due to kinetic hindrances. This has consequences for mantle flow and the shear stresses it exerts at the base of the lithosphere and hence to plate motions. Interestingly, the motion of the Nazca-South America pair is difficult to reproduce even in the most sophisticated models (Stadler et al. 2010) without invoking special coupling, rheology or forces. We examine the effects of the subduction of neutral and buoyant flat segments on mantle flow and plate motions, globally and locally for Nazca and South America. We construct high-resolution models of the morphology and density structure of the Nazca slab and embed them in an existing global slab model. We compute the global viscous flow induced and predict plate motions consistent with the density heterogeneity and plate geometry. As an end member we also examine a Nazca slab that dips uniformly with a 30 degree dip. We find, perhaps unsurprisingly, that the most important factor in matching plate velocities today is not the density structure of the slab but its geometry. A slab that dips at 30 degrees reproduces the Nazca plate motions almost exactly, with minor improvements when the real morphology is added. The lower mantle buoyancy remains important for the South American motions. Changes in plate or plate boundary rheology are not needed.",

We first estimated the fault length of about 200 km using 3-day aftershock distribution and the source duration of about 110 seconds using the duration of high-frequency energy radiation (Hara, 2007). Moment magnitude was estimated to be 8.0 using the formula of Hara (2007). From the results of 200 km of fault length and 110 seconds of source duration, we used the initial value of rupture velocity as 1.8 km/s for teleseismic waveform inversions.\nTeleseismic body wave inversion was carried out using the inversion package by Kikuchi and Kanamori (1991). Teleseismic P waveform data from 14 stations were used and band-pass filter of 0.005 ~ 1 Hz was applied. Our best-fit solution indicated that the earthquake occurred on the northwesterly striking (strike = 305) and shallowly dipping (dip = 13) fault plane. Focal depth was determined to be 23 km indicating shallow event. Moment magnitude of 7.8 was obtained showing somewhat smaller than the result obtained above and that of previous study (Lay et al., 2013). Large slip area was seen around the hypocenter.\nUsing the slip distribution obtained by teleseismic waveform inversion, we calculated the surface deformations using formulas of Okada (1985) assuming as the initial change of sea water by tsunami. Then tsunami simulation was carred out using Conell Multi-grid Coupled Tsunami Model (COMCOT) code and 1 min-grid topographic data for water depth from the General Bathymetric Chart of the Ocenas (GEBCO). According to the tsunami simulation, most of tsunami waves propagated to the directions of southwest and northeast which are perpendicular to the fault strike. DART buoy data were used to verify our simulation. In the presentation, we will discuss more details on the results of source process and tsunami simulation and compare them with the previous study.",

            "abstract": "The Community Land Model CLM version 4.5 (CLM4.5) was applied to simulate the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) for the 2454 km2 Rur catchment located in the border region of Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. NEE was measured within this catchment by six eddy covariance (EC) towers located on different land use sites. To reliably determine NEE patterns within the catchment, and taking into account uncertainty in observations, meteorological forcings, model parameters and initial conditions, we applied two different model-data fusion methods: (1.) The parameter estimation problem was solved using an adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The eight parameters estimated had been selected through sensitivity analysis. We tested the effect of different lengths of the model calibration period (4x3 months versus 1 year) and measurement averaging intervals (30 min. versus 6 hourly). Parameter estimation results were strongly influenced by initial model states and varied for the different seasons. For the one year runs parameter uncertainty was larger than for the three months runs. Posterior pdfs of parameters for three months periods differed significantly from the one year run. The parameter estimation results were evaluated for an additional verification period of one year. (2.) After model calibration, we assimilated leaf area index (LAI) and eddy covariance data into CLM using the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). Only model states (e.g. LAI, leaf nitrogen) were updated. We found that calculated LAI and other state variables for c3-grass and prognostic c3-crops in CLM are highly sensitive to meteorological input data. We assume this is due to the phenology of c3-grass and c3-crop in CLM which is strongly based on threshold values for e.g. temperature and precipitation to initiate onset and offset. Adding parameter uncertainty noticeably affected the data assimilation results.",

            "abstract": "The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is the leading mode of atmospheric circulation variability in the North Atlantic region. Long-term NAO reconstructions are crucial to better understand NAO variability in its response to climate forcing factors, and assess predictability and possible shifts associated with ongoing global warming. However, existing records are rare and often inconsistent (Pinto and Raible, 2012).\nFjord deposits have a great potential for providing high-resolution sedimentary records that reflect local terrestrial and marine processes and, therefore, offer unique opportunities for the investigation of sedimentological and geochemical climatically induced processes. Recently, Faust et al. (2014) provided a comprehensive overview of the Trondheimsfjord environmental system by applying a geochemical multiproxy analysis on surface sediment samples and compared his findings with available geochemical data from the fjords drainage area. Here we use the gained knowledge to establish the first high resolution NAO proxy record from marine sediments. By comparing geochemical measurements from a short sediment core with instrumental data we show that marine primary productivity proxies are sensitive to NAO changes during the past 50 years. This result is used to link a 2,800 years paleoproductivity record to a 500-year long winter NAO reconstruction based on early instrumental and documentary proxy data. We find that NAO variabilities coincide with climatically associated paleo-demographic trends and persistent positive/negative NAO phases are in accordance with cooler/warmer climate periods, such as Medieval Climate Anomaly and Little Ice Age. Moreover, negative NAO phases coincide with northern hemisphere glacier advances and rapid phase transitions related to large volcanic eruptions indicate the existence of internal atmospheric thresholds and instabilities in the atmospheric circulation pattern.\nFaust J.C., Knies J., Slagstad T., Vogt C., Milzer G. and Giraudeau J.

            "abstract": "Organic halogen gases, especially containing bromine and iodine, play a significant role as precursors to active halogen chemistry and ozone catalytic loss. Much of the reactive organic halogen originates from biological processes in the surface ocean, which can be quite variable by season and location. The tropics and coastal margins are potentially important sources that are being examined.\nThe recent coordinated CONTRAST/ATTREX/CAST missions were conducted in the Western Tropical Pacific, a region that is a major transport pathway for tropospheric air entering the stratosphere. One of the goals of the missions was to identify sources, distributions, and transport of organic halogens from the ocean surface into the tropical lower stratosphere. The missions were conducted during the NH winter season, Jan-Feb, 2014. In this presentation, we will discuss the distributions and variability of organic halogen gases in the study region and will examine the input of organic halogen species into the Tropical Tropopause Layer (TTL). Comparison with other tracers, such as methyl nitrate and NMHC, will help identify source regions for these gases. We will focus on the measurements obtained in the CONTRAST and ATTREX missions with data from in-situ GC/MS measurements and whole air samples collected on the NSF GV and NASA Global Hawk aircraft. Comparisons with other recent airborne campaigns, such as HIPPO and TC4, and with several ship-based studies will provide an additional context for evaluating the variability of organic halogen species in the tropical atmosphere and their role in transporting reactive halogen compounds into the UT/LS.",

            "abstract": "Ensemble hydro-meteorological predictions are considered to be useful for robust reservoir operation as they include multiple possible hydrological scenarios in the target river basin in the future as well as dispersion of the scenarios, which provides information on uncertainty contained in the prediction. Although operational ensemble hydro-meteorological predictions have been available in many regions, they have not yet been widely used in the actual reservoir management due to difficulty in the handling such complex information. To facilitate effective utilization of ensemble hydro-meteorological predictions in the reservoir management, a real-time reservoir operation method for water supply was developed considering operational ensemble forecasts of precipitation in Japan. One-week and one-month ensemble predictions of precipitation (EPPs) provided by Japan Meteorological Agency with respectively 51 and 50 ensemble members were employed here. In the method, an ensemble prediction of daily precipitation in the target river basin was firstly estimated for the coming one month from forecasted EPPs at grid point around the target river basin by using a multivariable regression model. An ensemble streamflow prediction was then estimated by use of Hydro-BEAM, a distributed rainfall-runoff model. Reservoir operation for drought management was then optimized considering the streamflow prediction for the coming one month by using stochastic dynamic programming techniques to consider stochastic nature of ensemble streamflow prediction. Water release was finally conducted according to the optimized operation strategy, updating EPPs and ensemble streamflow prediction in real time. The proposed method was applied to water supply operation of Sameura Reservoir in the Yoshino River basin in Japan, demonstrating improvement in its operation when considering both one-week and one-month ensemble forecasts of precipitation.",

            "abstract": "The design process of geotechnical installations includes the application of numerical simulation tools for safety assessment, dimensioning and long term effectiveness estimations. Underground salt caverns can be used for the storage of natural gas, hydrogen, oil, waste or compressed air. For their design one has to take into account fluctuating internal pressures due to different levels of filling, the stresses imposed by the surrounding rock mass, irregular geometries and possibly heterogeneous material properties [3] in order to estimate long term cavern convergence as well as locally critical wall stresses.\nConstitutive models applied to rock salt are usually viscoplastic in nature and most often based on a Burgers-type rheological model extended by non-linear viscosity functions and/or plastic friction elements. Besides plastic dilatation, healing and damage are sometimes accounted for as well [2].\nThe scales of the geotechnical system to be simulated and the laboratory tests from which material parameters are determined are vastly different. The most common material testing modalities to determine material parameters in geoengineering are the uniaxial and the triaxial compression tests. Some constitutive formulations in widespread use are formulated based on equivalent rather than tensorial quantities valid under these specific test conditions and are subsequently applied to heterogeneous underground systems and complex 3D load cases. We show here that this procedure is inappropriate and can lead to erroneous results. We further propose alternative formulations of the constitutive models in question that restore their validity under arbitrary loading conditions.\nFor an efficient numerical simulation, the discussed constitutive models are integrated locally with a Newton-Raphson algorithm that directly provides the algorithmically consistent tangent matrix for the global Newton iteration of the displacement based finite element formulation.\nFinally, the finite element implementations of the proposed constitutive formulations are employed to simulate an underground salt cavern used for compressed air energy storage with OpenGeoSys [1]. Transient convergence and stress fields are evaluated for typical fluctuating operation pressure regimes.",

Heterogeneous and complex data types can be produced and transferred at great speeds. This shift in volume, variety, and velocity of data produced has led to increased challenges in managing these Big Data. In addition, distributed research communities have greater needs for data quality control, discovery and public accessibility, and seamless integration for interdisciplinary study. Organizations charged with curating oceanographic data must also evolve to meet these needs and challenges, by employing new technologies and strategies.\nThe Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office (BCO-DMO) was created in 2006, to fulfill the data management needs of investigators funded by the NSF Ocean Sciences Biological and Chemical Sections and Polar Programs Antarctic Organisms and Ecosystems Program. Since its inception, the Office has had to modify internal systems and operations to address Big Data challenges to meet the needs of the ever-evolving oceanographic research community. Some enhancements include automated procedures replacing labor-intensive manual tasks, adoption of metadata standards facilitating machine client access, a geospatial interface and the use of Semantic Web technologies to increase data discovery and interoperability.

            "abstract": "The original database of total carbon, bulk density and iciness and new Geological map were compiled for carbon pool permafrost estimating in Quaternary deposits of North East Yakutia. The database was based on original drilling data on the main Quaternary stratigraphic units of Kolyma-Indigirka Lowland (12 key sites, 120 boreholes, 1000 samples). New geological map was created according Landsat-7 Satellite Image (spatial resolution - 30 m), the State Geological map of Quaternary Deposits (2000) and our field investigation for last 30 years in studying region. Studying area was divided into 3 regions according stratigraphy: East of Yana-Indigirka Lowland, Chukochya and Alazeya Rivers basins, East of Kolyma Lowland. Estimating was compiled for upper 25 m thickness.\n4 main geomorphological levels were selected for calculation: yedoma (12,8% of total area), alasses (48%), river valley (20,9%) and coastal accumulative lowland (16,7%). Our studies shows, that distribution of yedoma was overestimated in 3,5 times by State Geological Map, mainly due to underestimating of allases (increasing area on 60%).\nAccording our assessment, inorganic carbon doesn’t exceed 10% of total carbon in the studying area. Permafrost stratigraphic units contain 0.6-2.1% of TC, with the highest concentrations found in Cover Layer and Ice Complex (Yedoma). The biggest carbon pool is found in Olyor, which refers to the most widespread sediments studied and high carbon concentration (up to 18 kg*m-3). The TC pool of Yedoma was 1.5-2 times overestimated by previous studies due to less samples and underestimated iciness. The TC pool of Kolyma delta is 5-7 times overestimated because of higher total organic carbon values considered. Taking the morphology into account, the TC pool assessed is 23.4 ± 9.5 Gt at near 95 000 km2 area. Mean specific carbon content is around 9.9 kg*m-3 in Kolyma Lowland permafrost. The stratigraphic unit-based approach used to compile the database and its analysis provides detailed study of carbon storage in Arctic permafrost. It is well organized for adequately forecasting of permafrost degradation consequences for carbon cycle, including activation of microbiological processes and greenhouse gases emissions.\nThis research was supported by Russian Scientific Fund, Grant RSF 14-14-01115",

            "abstract": "The mode of lithospheric deformation related to the Tibetan plateau has been clarified as verging subduction of the Indian (northward) and Asian (southward) plates beneath the plateau, but how the lithosphere of the Tibetan plateau interacts with that of the North China craton (NCC) is still unclear due to shortage of data in the northeastern Tibet (NE Tibet). A long passive-source broadband seismic profile with densely spaced stations was conducted across the entire NE Tibet, extending to the southern border of the Alxa block (belonging to NCC). A structural model of lithosphere was derived from P and S receiver function imaging. Some significant features including the north-dipping intracrustal converter (NC) beneath the Kunlun-West Qinling orogen, the Moho offsets with overlaps beneath the fault zones and the low velocity layer (LVL) beneath the Qilian terrane were revealed by our observations. A synthesis of these observations probably indicates the oblique crustal thrusts (accompanied by shear) along the large strike-slip faults, taking the LVL as an intracrustal decollement. We did observe the Lithosphere-Asthenosphere Boundary (LAB), as south-dipping and descending continuously from beneath the interior Alxa to the Qilian block. Combining our profiling results with other seismic evidence, we infer that, the lithosphere of NCC may underthrust beneath the Qilian block and as a minimum reach the southern margin of the Qilian block (bounded by the West Qinling fault zone) to the south. We suggest that, the continental subduction of lithosphere of the NCC accompanied by crustal thrusts is a preferred mode of the lithospheric deformation beneath NE Tibet, which is responsible for the plateau growth in the northeastern margin of Tibetan plateau.",

            "abstract": "Worldwide, sustainable water resource management becomes an increasingly challenging task due to the growth of population and extensive applications of fertilizer in agriculture. Moreover, climate change causes further stresses to both water quantity and quality. Reactive transport modeling in the coupled soil-aquifer system is a viable approach to assess the impacts of different land use and groundwater exploitation scenarios on the water resources.\nHowever, the application of this approach is usually limited in spatial scale and to simplified geochemical systems due to the huge computational expense involved. Such computational expense is not only caused by solving the high non-linearity of the initial boundary value problems of water flow in the unsaturated zone numerically with rather fine spatial and temporal discretization for the correct mass balance and numerical stability, but also by the intensive computational task of quantifying geochemical reactions.\nIn the present study, a flexible and efficient tool for large scale reactive transport modeling in variably saturated porous media and its applications are presented. The open source scientific software OpenGeoSys (OGS) is coupled with the IPhreeqc module of the geochemical solver PHREEQC. The new coupling approach makes full use of advantages from both codes: OGS provides a flexible choice of different numerical approaches for simulation of water flow in the vadose zone such as the pressure-based or mixed forms of Richards equation; whereas the IPhreeqc module leads to a simplification of data storage and its communication with OGS, which greatly facilitates the coupling and code updating. Moreover, a parallelization scheme with MPI (Message Passing Interface) is applied, in which the computational task of water flow and mass transport is partitioned through domain decomposition, whereas the efficient parallelization of geochemical reactions is achieved by smart allocation of computational workload over multiple compute nodes. The plausibility of the new coupling is verified by several benchmark tests. In addition, the efficiency of the new coupling approach is demonstrated by its application in a large scale scenario, in which the environmental fate of pesticides in a complex soil-aquifer system is studied.",

            "abstract": "Recent in situ electric field measurements by the Van Allen Probes in the radiation belts have revealed the existence and ubiquitous presence of double layers [Mozer et al. Phys. Rev. Lett., 2013]. Encounters with double layers during 1 minute burst mode intervals were both common and indicative of large cumulative potential drops. With electric fields averaging 20 mV/m, and sometimes reaching as high as 100 mV/m, observed double layers have been suggested as possible accelerators of radiation belt electrons and generators of a seed population of 100 keV. \nUsing a Hamiltonian approach we quantify the energization threshold of electrons interacting with radiation belts' double layers analytically and numerically. We find that double layers with electric field amplitude δE ranging between 10-100 mV/m and spatial scales of the order of few Debye lengths are very efficient in energizing electrons with initial velocities v ≤ vthermal≈3000 km/s to 1 keV levels, but are unable to energize electrons with energies E ≥ 10 keV. Our results therefore indicate that the localized electric field associated with the double layers are unlikely to generate a seed population of 100 keV necessary for a plethora of relativistic acceleration mechanisms and additional transport to higher energetic levels.",

A lower crustal magma chamber imaged at ~24 km depth beneath Boset volcano is one of the deepest melt bodies observed in an extensional environment. Beneath the Ethiopian plateau, where previous studies suggest an extensive and thick underplate, we show that a 6-8 km thick, localized zone of magmatic intrusion into the lower crust better matches all existing data. The magmatic lens beneath the rift and the magmatically intruded lower crust appear to be associated with recent magmatism in the Wonji Fault Belt (WFB) and Silti-Debre Zeyit Fault Zone (SDFZ). Active extension and magmatic intrusion in the lower crust may drive rift propagation into the cratonic block of the Ethiopian plateau from the rift valley rather than following the existing rifted crust.",

To address this issue over Indian arid zone (local source of mineral dust), a short field campaign was organized in Jodhpur, located in Rajasthan, a north western state of India, over seven sites (four in city and three far from city) with varying altitudes in June 2013. Jodhpur lies in vicinity of the Thar Desert of Rajasthan. Particles were collected on pure Tin substrates for individual particle morphological and elemental composition analysis using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) equipped with Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS). The morphological parameters (e.g. Aspect ratio; AR, Circulatory parameter; CIR.) were retrieved following Okada et al. (2001) using Image J software. Columnar spectral aerosol optical thickness has been measured by Microtops-II sun photometer for a set of five wavelengths (380 to 1020 nm) over all the sites in tandem with regional aerosol collection. SEM analysis reveals that the particles close to spherical shape (AR range 1.0-1.2) were found to be ~ 18% whereas particles with AR range 1.2-1.4 were found to be abundant (25%) followed with that of AR range 1.4-1.6 and 1.6-1.8 (each ~ 17%) and 1.8-2.0 (~ 14%) while the particles with AR >2 (highly non-spherical) were found to be ~ 8%. Here, it is noteworthy to mention that AR=1 for spherical particle while increasing AR (>1) exhibit increasing non-sphericity of particles. The EDS analysis reveals that 43% particles were observed with low hematite (H ≤ 1%; volume percentage), 24% (H 1-2 %), 14% (H 2-3%), 5% (H 3-4%) and 14% (H >4%). The aforementioned proportions will be extremely useful for simulating the optical and radiative properties of regional aerosols. From the Microtops-II observations, Ångström exponent for spectral interval of 380 to 1020 nm over Masuria Hill Garden was found to be the least (~0.55) amongst all the sites indicating the presence of coarse mode particles over this site. The SEM micrographs also reveal the dominance of coarse mode particles over this site. The correlation amongst all the observed parameters together with meteorological parameters will be discussed in detail.",

Although the detailed physics of snowpack accumulation and melt are relatively well understood at the point scale, their manifestation at the catchment scale remains complex. In this talk we summarise a number of recent advances that contribute to improved understanding of snow and its impact on streamflow. These include a new way of classifying hydrologically different types of snow-dominated environments using similarity indices, a model of climate-snowpack relationships obtained by simplifying the temperature index method, and new evidence of the impact of snow on streamflow, indicating that, other things being equal, catchments with less snow produce lower mean streamflow. With future temperature warming, snowfall is likely to decrease, and the new result suggests that streamflow would tend to decrease as a consequence, with greatest proportional impact in arid snow-dominated catchments.",

This presentation reports the the results of a comparative study on changes of regional ice sheet mass and surface elevation based on observations of GRACE and ICESat satellites over the period of 2004 – 2008 in the Lambert Glacier-Amery Ice Shelf System (LAS), East Antarctica. LAS is an important drainage system in East Antarctica and one of the significant contributors to the mass budget of the Antarctic.\nWe fitted the GRACE monthly solutions to a model that contains a linear trend, an acceleration, annual and semiannual terms, and a 161 days tide aliasing term (S2). We employed the IJ05 R2 GIA model. For ICESat observations, we employed a modified spatial-temporal polynomial model to describe the ice surface topography and an annual elevation change rate (trend), which is solved by using repeat-track points within a moving box along the repeating tracks. Uncertainties of the source data and the estimated trends from both GRACE and ICESat data are given. The mass changes from GRACE and ICESat are compared and the differences are analyzed. A number of key issues in the comparison and mass – volume conversion are discussed. Afterwards, spatial and temporal correlations between the results at the annual change level derived from the two data sets are analyzed. Impact of firn models, GIA models, and comparison with other research results in LAS demonstrated.",

However, despite a lower carbon concentration, subsoil horizons (<0.3 m) contain more than half of global soil organic carbon. In deeper soils the cycling of soil carbon is proposed to be slower but its vulnerability to projected climate change is still under debate. As in surface soils, deep soil microorganisms are responsible for both the decomposition and the formation of soil organic matter (SOM) and their response in terms of biomass, activity, composition and function may be key to determine how environmental change will alter deep carbon turnover and nutrient cycling. Here we explore how warming across a whole soil profile impacts microbial community composition and decomposition of SOM. We have established a soil warming experiment at the Blodgett Forest Research Station, CA, with warming of +4°C to >1 m depth relative to the natural soil temperature gradient. Samples were taken along the soil profile and initial results comparing pre-warming to six months post warming initiation are being compared. Alterations in microbial community composition were analyzed via 16S rRNA gene sequencing and changes in the decomposition potential of SOM were assessed via extracellular enzyme activity measurements. In this ongoing experiment, we aim to understand the microbial contribution to the turnover of SOM at different soil depths and how microbial responses to projected increases in atmospheric temperature might impact SOM stability.",

Different approaches for the estimation of biomass are being used: from static approaches where the amount of biomass only depends on the land cover type to dynamic approaches where vegetation models provide the variations in available fuel due to, e.g. vegetation phenology, meteorology or disturbances.\nIn this study we assess the influence of seasonal variations, spatial variations driven by climate and long term changes due to CO2 fertilization in vegetation carbon pools on burned area and fire emissions on global scale. We use a land surface model (JSBACH) including an implementation of the mechanistic fire model SPITFIRE. We perform a reference simulation with daily updated carbon pools and simulations with the fuel load fixed to the mean fuel load per grid cell, to maximum monthly fuel load and the minimum monthly fuel load to address the influence of seasonal variations. We address the influence of climate driven spatial variations by using constant fuel loads per plant functional type (PFT) in an additional simulation. The influence of CO2 fertilization on fire occurrence and emissions is covered by comparing a simulation with historical CO2 increase, with a simulation where we use constant preindustrial CO2 with the same meteorological forcing.\nThe simulation using the mean fuel load per grid cell shows similar results to the reference simulation with respect to global values, spatial distribution and variability in time. The simulations using minimum and maximum fuel show a large difference in global values, but similar spatial distributions. In the simulation based on constant fuel loads per PFT the peak in emissions along a precipitation gradient is shifted towards lower precipitation values. The simulation with preindustrial CO2 fertilization shows a strong reduction in carbon emissions and in burned area compared to the historical simulation.",

            "abstract": "The generation of the Earth’s magnetic field by dynamo action in the liquid iron core is modeled by a large set of coupled, non-linear partial differential equations. Numerical models presently involve direct discretization of the geodynamo equations and allow to produce axial dipolar magnetic fields that are qualitatively comparable to the Earth's one, but whose dynamics remain considerably remote from the geophysical regime.\nIndeed, due to the extreme values of the dimensionless numbers characterizing the Earth’s core dynamics, the relevant regime remains far beyond the reach of direct numerical simulation - so far that one cannot simply rely on the increase in computational power. Simplification of the governing equations is not straightforward. In particular, the importance of return flow from the thin Ekman layers located at the inner core and core-mantle boundaries into the main flow prevents one from purely suppressing the viscous dissipation term in Navier-Stokes equation even in the limiting case where inertia is neglected. Therefore more advanced models are needed, which require prior mathematical treatment of the equations of magnetohydrodynamics. The one-dimensional structure of most viscous and magnetic layers demonstrates the possibility of huge computational savings by means of multiscale techniques. In our approach, asymptotic matching is applied on simplified problems such as the Proudman-Stewartson flow to solve for the viscous shear layers while keeping the mainstream resolved on a coarse grid.",

The strongest (Mw 9) earthquake shaking signatures appear to create multi-pulsed individual turbidites, where the number and character of multiple coarse-grained pulses for correlative turbidites generally remain constant both upstream and downstream in different channel systems. Multiple turbidite pulses, that correlate with multiple ruptures shown in seismograms of historic earthquakes (e.g. Chile 1960, Sumatra 2004 and Japan 2011), support this hypothesis. The weaker (Mw = or < 8) (e.g. northern California San Andreas) earthquakes generate dominantly upstream simple fining-up (uni-pulsed) turbidites in single tributary canyons and channels; however, downstream stacked turbidites result from synchronously triggered multiple turbidity currents that deposit in channels below confluences of the tributaries. Proven tsunamites, which result from tsunami waves sweeping onshore and shallow water debris into deeper water, are a fine-grained turbidite cap over other seismo-turbidites. In contrast, MTDs and seismo-turbidites result from slope failures. Multiple great earthquakes cause seismic strengthening of slope sediment, which results in minor MTDs in basin floor turbidite system deposits (e.g. maximum run-out distances of MTDs across basin floors along active margins are up to an order of magnitude less than on passive margins). In contrast, the MTDs and turbidites are equally intermixed in turbidite systems of passive margins (e.g. Gulf of Mexico). In confined basin settings, earthquake triggering results in a common facies pattern of coeval megaturbidites in proximal settings, thick stacked turbidites downstream, and ponded muddy homogenite turbidites in basin or sub-basin centers, sometimes with a cap of seiche deposits showing bi-directional flow patterns.",

The ROLIS camera will provide the ground truth for the Rosetta OSIRIS camera. ROLIS will acquire images both during the descent and after landing. In this paper we concentrate on the post-landing images. The close-up images will enable us to characterize the morphology and texture of the surface, and the shape, albedo, and size distribution of the particles on scales as small as 0.3 mm per pixel. We may see evidence for a dust mantle, a refractory crust, and exposed ice. In addition, we hope to identify features such as pores, cracks, or vents that allow volatiles to escape the surface. We will not only image the surface during the day but also the night, when LEDs will illuminate the surface in four different colors (blue, green, red, near-IR). This will characterize the spectral properties and heterogeneity of the surface, helping us to identify its composition. Although the ROLIS spectral range and resolution are too limited to allow an exact mineralogical characterization, a study of the spectral slope and albedo will allow a broad classification of the solid surface phases. We expect to be able to distinguish between organic material, silicates and ices. By repeated imaging over the course of the mission ROLIS may detect long term changes associated with cometary activity.",

            "abstract": "Water-soluble dicarboxylic acids such as oxalic acid (C2) are the dominant organic compound class in atmospheric aerosols. They can act as cloud condensation nuclei and affect on the Earth climate. Diacids can be primary emitted from fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning and secondarily produced by photochemical oxidations of biogenic and anthropogenic hydrocarbons. However, their sources and formation processes are still not well understood. Recently model and observation studies suggested the importance of isoprene as a precursor of oxalic acid. Isoprene is the most abundant BVOC emitted from terrestrial plants and can serve as important precursors of diacids. We conducted a laboratory oxidation of isoprene (2.0 ppm) with ozone (4.3 ppm) in a Teflon bag for 10 to 480 min. The formed particles were collected with quartz fiber filters and analyzed for diacids, oxoacids and a-dicarbonyls employing water extraction and butyl ester derivatization and using GC and GC/MS techniques. Here, we report the analytical results to better understand the formation process of diacids and related compounds from isoprene.\nWe detected homologous series of saturated diacids (C2-C6), unsaturated diacids (maleic and methylmaleic acids), w-oxocarboxylic acids (C2-C9), pyruvic acid, glyoxal and methylglyoxal. We found that oxalic acid (3000-9700 ngm-3) is the most abundant diacid followed by succinic (C4) or malonic (C3) acid. Their concentrations increased with reaction time showing a maximum in 4 hours. Interestingly, C3/C4 ratios increased with time. The second most abundant species after oxalic acid was generally methylglyoxal (3600-9600 ngm-3), except for the 30 min. sample where methylglyoxal was more abundant than oxalic acid. Glyoxylic acid (wC2) was found as the most abundant oxoacid (1600-3800 ngm-3) followed by wC3 and wC4. Although the concentrations of diacids and related compounds are 1-2 orders magnitude higher than those reported in ambient aerosols, this study demonstrates that isoprene is an important precursor of diacids in atmospheric particles.",

The measurements indicate that these air masses differ from the stratospheric background. The calculation of 40 day backward trajectories with the trajectory module of the CLaMS model shows that these air masses are affected by the Asian monsoon anticyclone. Some air masses originate from the boundary layer in Southeast Asia/West Pacific and are rapidly lifted (1–2 days) within a typhoon. Afterwards they are injected directly into the anticyclonic circulation of the Asian monsoon. The subsequent long-range transport (8–14 days) of enhanced water vapour and pollutants to the lowermost stratosphere in Northern Europe is driven by eastward transport of tropospheric air from the Asian monsoon anticyclone caused by an eddy shedding event. We find that the combination of rapid uplift by a typhoon and eastward eddy shedding from the Asian monsoon anticyclone is an additional fast transport pathway that, for the case studied here, carries boundary emissions from Southeast Asia/West Pacific within approximately 5 weeks to the lowermost stratosphere in Northern Europe.",

Hence, the common points were produced in both European Datum 1950 (ED50), and TNFGN.\nIt is known that the geological and geophysical information about the network area can be obtained by the evaluation of the coordinate and scale variations in a geodetic network. For one such evaluation, the coordinate variations and velocities of network points, and also the strains are investigated. However, the principal problem in derivation of velocities arises from two different datums. In this context, the computation of velocities using the coordinate data of the ED50 and TNFGN is not accurate and reliable. Likewise, the analysis of strain from the coordinate differences is not reliable. However, due to the fact that the scale of a geodetic network is independent from datum, the strains can be derived from scale variations accurately and reliably.\nIn this study, a test area limited 39.5°–42.0° northern latitudes and 31.0°–37.0° eastern longitudes was chosen. The benchmarks in this test area are composed of 30 geodetic control points derived with the aim of cadastral and engineering applications. We used data mining to investigate the common benchmarks in both reference systems for this area.  Accordingly, the ED50 and TNFGN coordinates refer 1954 and 2005, respectively. Thus, it has been investigated the strain accumulation of 51 years in this region. It should be also noted that since 1954, the earthquakes have not registered greater than magnitude 6.0 in the test area. It is a considerable situation for this evaluation.\nThe finite element analysis is used in order to derive the strain accumulation and rates in the test area (Figure 1).

            "abstract": "In the Himalaya, debris-covered glaciers cover significant portions of the glacierised area. Their behaviour is not entirely understood, but they seem to experience strong mass losses in direct contradiction with the insulating effect of debris. A characteristic most debris-covered glaciers share is the appearance of cliffs and lakes on their surface. These supraglacial features play a role in surface evolution, dynamics and downwasting of debris-covered glaciers but their actual effects have not been quantified at the glacier scale.\nNumerous measurements of radiative fluxes at the cliff surface, detailed survey of cliffs geometry and ablation have been conducted on the debris-covered Lirung Glacier, Nepalese Himalayas. We used four 20cm-resolution DEMs obtained from UAV flights to represent the glacier surface to a very detailed degree. As the debris remains stable on slopes up to 30°, ice cliffs show inclinations above this threshold and were clearly represented in the DEMs.\nDirect measurements and a point-scale cliff-backwasting model have showed that melt patterns over a single cliff are highly variable across and along the ice surface due to non-uniform geometry, varying inclination, aspect and terrain view factors. Variability in observed ablation was large also among cliffs. We therefore developed an energy balance model with a gridded representation of the cliff to understand the melt behaviour at the cliff scale. Previous models assumed the cliff to be a plane with a constant slope and aspect, and extrapolation of melt rates to the glacier scale based on this assumption might be erroneous.\nUsing a grid-based approach allows representation of real inclined areas of the cliff. The detailed surface from the UAV-DEM was taken as initial condition for the model. The model was in close agreement with ablation measurements at numerous stakes located on 3 cliffs. Results show very high variability both along the cliffs' elevation and extension. These cannot be predicted with statistical relationships between slopes, aspect and exposure to the surrounding terrain because of the interplay between topography and energy fluxes. Only an energy balance model based on the actual complex geometry of the cliffs can reproduce their backwasting, which amounts to a significant component of the glacier's annual mass balance.",

Models are often used to examine snow covered area (SCA) of large geographical areas and to understand snow cover variability. We utilize the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model, combined with the Noah land surface model with multiparameterization options (Noah-MP), to simulate snow cover fraction (SCF) in a 3 km domain over the central Sierra Nevada, which includes the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, Merced, and San Joaquin watersheds. The impact of several microphysics schemes on SCF simulation is compared. The Thompson microphysics scheme is capable of identifying total domain-wide SCA with an error of 2144.2 km2 (25%). The Goddard scheme has a RMSE of 2393.6 km2 (28%) for simulating SCA, and the Community Atmospheric Model 5.1 scheme has a RMSE of 2384.0 km2 (27%). While WRF correctly simulates the presence or absence of snow in an average snow year, the model consistently simulates too much snow on the western side of the Sierra Nevada and too little on the eastern side, regardless of microphysics scheme. For the Thompson microphysics option, WRF simulates SCF on a mid-winter day with an overall bias of ~17% compared to satellite observations. However, the bias is ~31% on the western side of the range and ~-23% on the eastern side. Further work will aim to understand the differences in SCF simulation skill on either side of the Sierra Nevada range. Wet and dry years will also be examined to determine whether the east/west bias prevails in years with different accumulation patterns.",

            "abstract": "Lower Cretaceous strata of the Alaska North Slope contain the world’s most voluminous (1.2 million km3), highest relief (>1 km thick), and longest (600 km west-east) foreland clinoform depositional sequence. Although the regional stratigraphic framework of the Torok-Nanushuk clinoform sequence is well known, absolute age constraints are lacking. Existing, relatively imprecise “Aptian-Albian” biostratigraphy has hindered a quantitative understanding of clinoform depositional processes. We establish chronostratigraphy for the Torok-Nanushuk clinoform sequence with detrital zircon U/Pb geochronology from 9 localities from exploration well cores and outcrop samples (n=1666 grains). Maximum depositional ages defined by young detrital zircon U/Pb age populations, likely derived from coeval volcanism in Russian Chukotka, become progressively younger in the direction of eastward progradation. These data reveal a major progradational surge between 116 and 104 Ma when the shelf margin prograded more than 525 km. The rapid progradation (~45 km/m.y.) and sediment flux (~100,000 km3/m.y.) of this high-relief clinoform deposystem was sustained for 12 m.y. and suggests a supply-dominated system. This deposystem filled relict Colville basin accommodation that had developed as a flexural response to earlier Brooks Range tectonic loading. Clinoform dip directions and detrital zircon provenance indicate that the sediment was derived primarily from Russian Chukotka during longitudinal, eastward sediment dispersal. Progradation slowed after 104 Ma when seismic stratigraphy shows a shift from progradational to aggradational shelf-margin trajectories. The shelf margin prograded only another 60 km eastward before a sequence-bounding retrogradation occurred at 96 Ma. Our chronostratigraphy quantifies that rates of progradation and sediment flux were three times greater than previously believed during the major phase of basin filling. These rates are among the highest in the world for a clinoform deposystem in a foreland basin.

            "abstract": "Large amplitude Alfven waves are ubiquitously observed in solar wind plasmas. Mjolhus(JPP, 1976) and Mio et al(JPSJ, 1976) found that nonlinear evolution of the uni-directional, parallel propagating Alfven waves can be described by the derivative nonlinear Schrodinger equation (DNLS). Later, the multi-dimensional extension (Mjolhus and Wyller, JPP, 1988; Passot and Sulem, POP, 1993; Gazol et al, POP, 1999) and ion kinetic modification (Mjolhus and Wyller, JPP, 1988; Spangler, POP, 1989; Medvedev and Diamond, POP, 1996; Nariyuki et al, POP, 2013) of DNLS have been reported. Recently, Nariyuki derived multi-dimensional DNLS from an expanding box model of the Hall-MHD system (Nariyuki, submitted). The set of equations including the nonlinear evolution of compressional wave modes (TDNLS) was derived by Hada(GRL, 1993). DNLS can be derived from TDNLS by rescaling of the variables (Mjolhus, Phys. Scr., 2006). Nariyuki and Hada(JPSJ, 2007) derived a kinetically modified TDNLS by using a simple Landau closure (Hammet and Perkins, PRL, 1990; Medvedev and Diamond, POP, 1996). In the present study, we revisit the ion kinetic modification of multi-dimensional TDNLS through more rigorous derivations, which is consistent with the past kinetic modification of DNLS. Although the original TDNLS was derived in the multi-dimensional form, the evolution of waves with finite propagation angles in TDNLS has not been paid much attention. Applicability of the resultant models to solar wind turbulence is discussed.",

            "abstract": "A series of three-dimensional geologic modeling was performed using a geostatistical geologic model GOCAD (ASGA and Paradigm) to characterize quantitatively and to visualize realistically a prospective deep underground laboratory site for high-level radioactive waste disposal in Korea. The necessity of a deep underground laboratory arises from its in-situ conditions for related deep scientific experiments. However, the construction and operation of such a deep underground laboratory take great efforts and expenses owing to its larger depth and thus higher geologic uncertainty. For these reasons, quantitative characterization and realistic visualization of geologic formations and structures of a deep underground laboratory site is crucial before its construction and operation. The study area for the prospective deep underground laboratory site is mainly consists of Precambrian metamorphic rocks as a complex. First, various topographic and geologic data of the study area were collected from literature and boreholes and preliminarily analyzed. Based on the preliminary analysis results, a three-dimensional structural model, which consists of the boundaries between the geologic formations and structures, was established, and a three-dimensional grid model, which consists of hexahedral grid blocks, was produced. Three-dimensional geologic formation model was then established by polymerizing these two models. Finally, a series of three-dimensional lithofacies modeling was performed using the sequential indicator simulation (SIS) and truncated Gaussian simulation (TGS). The volume fractions of metamorphic rocks predicted using the TGS are more similar to the actual data observed in boreholes than those predicted using the SIS. These three-dimensional geologic modeling results can improve a quantitative and realistic understanding of geologic characteristics of the prospective deep underground laboratory site for high-level radioactive waste disposal and thus can provide practical guidelines for its precise construction and safe operation.

            "abstract": "Mars is a dry planet, with actively blowing sand in many regions. In the absence of stable liquid water and an active hydrosphere, rates of chemical weathering are slow, such that aeolian abrasion is a dominant agent of landscape modification where sand is present and winds above threshold occur at sufficient frequency. Reflecting this activity, ventifacts, rocks that have been abraded by windborne particles, and wind-eroded outcrops, are common. They provide invaluable markers of the Martian wind record and insight into climate and landscape modification.\nVentifacts are distributed along the traverse of the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover. They contain one or more diagnostic features and textures: Facets, keels, basal sills, elongated pits, scallops/flutes, grooves, rock tails, and lineations. Keels at the junction of facets are sharp enough to pose a hazard MSL’s wheels in some areas. Geomorphic and textural patterns on outcrops indicate retreat of windward faces. Moonlight Valley and other depressions are demarcated by undercut walls and scree boulders, with the valley interiors containing fewer rocks, most of which show evidence for significant abrasion. Together, this suggests widening and undercutting of the valley walls, and erosion of interior rocks, by windblown sand.\nHiRISE images do not show any dark sand dunes in the traverse so far, in contrast to the large dune field to the south that is migrating up to 2 m per year. In addition, ChemCam shows that the rock Bathurst has a rind rich in mobile elements that would be removed in an abrading environment. This indicates that rock abrasion was likely more dominant in the past, a hypothesis consistent with rapid scarp retreat as suggested by the cosmogenic noble gases in Yellowknife Bay. Ventifacts and evidence for bedrock abrasion have also been found at the Pathfinder, Spirit, and Opportunity sites, areas, like the Curiosity traverse so far, that lack evidence for current high sand fluxes. Yardangs are also common on the planet, regardless of whether local sand is mobile. This suggest that abrasion on Mars is an episodic process driven by the passage of sand in which rock retreat rates, based on fluxes of current active dunes, may reach 10s of microns per year. Such a process has acted, over long time scales, to imprint upon the surface a record of sand activity.",

            "abstract": "The maintenance of marsh platform elevation under sea level rise is dependent on sedimentation and biomass conversion to soil organic material. These physical and biological processes interact within the tidal zone, resulting in elevation-dependent processes contributing to marsh accretion. Here we explore spatial pattern in plant litter, a variable related to productivity, to understand its role in physical and biological interactions in a freshwater marsh. Plant litter that persists through the dormant season has an extended period of influence on ecosystem processes. We conducted a field and remote sensing analysis of plant litter height, biomass, vertical cover, and stem density (collectively termed plant litter structure) at a tidal freshwater marsh located along the Potomac River estuary. We completed two years of repeat RTK GPS surveys with corresponding measurements of litter height (over 2000 observations) to train a non-parametric random forest decision tree to predict litter height. LiDAR and field observations show that plant litter height increases with increasing elevation, although important deviations from this relationship are apparent. These spatial patterns exhibit stability from year to year and lead to corresponding patterns in soil organic matter content, revealed by loss on ignition of surface sediments. The amount of mineral material embedded within plant litter decreases with increasing elevation, representing an important trade-off with litter structure. Therefore, at low elevations where litter structure is short and sparse, the role of plant litter is to capture sediment; at high elevations where litter structure is tall and dense, litter contributes organic matter to soil development. Despite these tradeoffs, changes in elevation over time are consistent across elevation, with only small positive differences in elevation gain over time at elevations where the most sediment is deposited or where litter exhibits the most biomass.",

            "abstract": "Asian dust is a well-known spring season phenomenon originating from arid or semiarid highlands in northern China and Mongolia. Many previous studies suggested that the occurrence and transport of Asian dust (i.e. dust activity) are closely related to variations in large-scale climate variables and local to regional climate conditions, and demonstrated the physical and dynamic mechanisms behind these relationships. However, the physical mechanism involved in the link between wintertime climate variability and spring dust activity was not fully explored. In this work, we analyzed the impacts of the wintertime Arctic Oscillation (AO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on spring dust activity over northern China. After an extensive analysis for the effect of wintertime AO, we observed colder surface temperatures, stronger weather fluctuations, and frequent cold surges over northern China during the negative phase of AO, and thus found that AO can affect spring dust activity with time-lagged consistency. While there are many similarities between AO and NAO, on the other hand, previous studies suggested that they are significantly different in both their dynamical interpretation such as zonal-mean structure, and their spatial and temporal variability. In this study, AO is positively correlated with NAO with the correlation coefficient of +0.51, for the winter seasons of 1953-2007. In spite of high correlation with in-phase combinations, the enhancement of spring dust activity during the negative phase of NAO is higher than that during the negative phase of AO. Based on the superiority in dust activity, the possible differences in physical mechanism between AO and NAO will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The pressures on water resources due to increasing levels of societal demand, increasing conflict of interest and uncertainties with regard to freshwater availability create challenges for water managers and policymakers in many parts of Europe. At the same time, climate change adds a new level of pressure and uncertainty with regard to freshwater supplies. On the other hand, the small-scale sectoral structure of water management is now reaching its limits. The integrated management of water in basins requires a new level of consideration where water bodies are to be viewed in the context of the whole river system and managed as a unit within their basins.\nIn this research we present the limitations and challenges of modelling the hydrology of the continent Europe. The challenges include: data availability at continental scale and the use of globally available data, streamgauge data quality and their misleading impacts on model calibration, calibration of large-scale distributed model, uncertainty quantification, and computation time. We describe how to avoid over parameterization in calibration process and introduce a parallel processing scheme to overcome high computation time. We used Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) program as an integrated hydrology and crop growth simulator to model water resources of the Europe continent. Different components of water resources are simulated and crop yield and water quality are considered at the Hydrological Response Unit (HRU) level. The water resources are quantified at subbasin level with monthly time intervals for the period of 1970-2006. The use of a large-scale, high-resolution water resources models enables consistent and comprehensive examination of integrated system behavior through physically-based, data-driven simulation and provides the overall picture of water resources temporal and spatial distribution across the continent. The calibrated model and results provide information support to the European Water Framework Directive and lay the basis for further assessment of the impact of climate change on water availability in Europe. The approach and methods developed are general and can be applied to any large region around the world.",

            "abstract": "The mantle sections of ophiolites offer a useful approach to studying compositional heterogeneities in the oceanic mantle. A potential caveat is that the tectonic provenance of ophiolites is often not easy to decipher, although many have undergone at least supra-subduction zone (SSZ) processing. Significant outstanding questions include the degree to which ophiolite peridotites preserve evidence of pre-SSZ events and the way that SSZ melt extraction modifies the character of these peridotites. A suite of Caledonian ophiolites associated with the closure of the Iapetus Ocean offers an opportunity to shed light on these issues, in particular to assess the degree to which long (regional) wavelength compositional heterogeneities survive SSZ melting. Observations on the combined highly-siderophile element (HSE) and 187Os/188Os systematics of the broadly coetaneous (490-500 Ma) Shetland Ophiolite Complex (Scotland) and Leka Ophiolite Complex (LOC; Norway) are presented here.\nGenerally, the lithological composition of each locality is harzburgitic, and hosts lenses and layers of dunite, chromitite and pyroxenite that are interpreted as representing SSZ-related (channelised) melt migration and melt-rock interaction. Although the bulk of the harzburgitic rocks have approximately chondritic initial 187Os/188Os and HSE abundances, ancient (Proterozoic) melt depletion (TRD =1.4 to 1 Ga) is recorded in ~10% of samples from each locality. This is also commonly observed in abyssal peridotites. One important implication of the data is that SSZ melt generation/migration has had no discernible impact on the bulk Os isotopic composition of the Iapetus oceanic mantle. By contrast, non-harzburgitic lithologies consistently exhibit more radiogenic initial 187Os/188Os and more variable HSE abundances. The dunites, chromitites and pyroxenites of the LOC can be separated into two groups on the basis of isochrons that they define; yielding ages of 481±22 Ma and 589±15 Ma, respectively. The former age corresponds, within error, to the accepted age of the ophiolite (497 ± 2 Ma). The meaning of the latter age is uncertain, but may correspond to the early stages of Iapetus opening. The data imply that the oceanic mantle represented by both ophiolites resembles a ‘patchwork’ of peridotites of different ages and compositions.",

            "abstract": "As the Earth’s population continues to grow and demand for food increases, multiple cropping is an effective way to increase crop production. Cropping intensity, which we define here as the number of cropping cycles per year, is an important dimension of land use that is strongly influences water demand and agricultural production. Satellite data provide global land cover maps with indispensable information regarding areal extent of global croplands and its distribution. However, the land use information such as cropping intensity is not routinely provided by global land cover products from instruments such as MODIS, because mapping this information from remote sensing is challenging. We present a straight forward but efficient algorithm for automated mapping of agricultural intensity over large geographic regions using 8-day MODIS EVI time series data derived from Terra and Aqua MODIS surface reflectance products. The proposed algorithm first applies an adaptive Savitzky-Golay filter to smooth Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series derived from MODIS surface reflectance data, and then uses an iterative moving-window methodology to identify cropping cycles from the smoothed EVI time series. Comparison of results from our algorithm with national survey data at both the provincial and prefectural level in China show that the algorithm provides estimates of gross sown area that agree well with inventory data. Accuracy assessment using data generated by expert classification of randomly selected pixel samples indicates an overall accuracy of 91.0% for three agricultural intensity classes. More generally, the algorithm shows significant potential to automatically estimate reliable cropping intensity information in support of large-scale studies of agricultural land use and land cover dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Lakes encompass a large part of the surface cover in the northern boreal and tundra areas of northern Canada and are therefore a significant component of the terrestrial hydrological system. To understand the hydrologic cycle over subarctic and arctic landscapes, estimating surface parameters such as surface net radiation, soil moisture, and surface albedo is important. Although ground-based field measurements provide a good temporal resolution, these data provide a limited spatial representation and are often restricted to the summer period (from June to August), and few surface-based stations are located in high-latitude regions. In this respect, spaceborne remote sensing provides the means to monitor surface hydrology and to estimate components of the surface energy balance with reasonable spatial and temporal resolutions required for hydrological investigations, as well as for providing more spatially representative lake-relevant information than available from in situ measurements.\nThe primary objective of this study is to quantify the sources of temporal and spatial variability in surface albedo over subarctic wetland from satellite derived albedo measurements in the Hudson Bay Lowlands near Churchill, Manitoba. The spatial variability in albedo within each land-cover type is investigated through optical satellite imagery from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper, Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager obtained in different seasons from spring into fall (April and October) over a 30-year period (1984-2013). These data allowed for an examination of the spatial variability of surface albedo under relatively dry and wet summer conditions (i.e. 1984, 1998 versus 1991, 2005). A detailed analysis of Landsat-derived surface albedo (ranging from 0.09 to 0.15) conducted in the Churchill region for August is inversely related to surface water fraction calculated from Landsat images. Preliminary analysis of surface albedo observed between July and August are 0.10 to 0.15, and vary due to differences in meteorological parameters such as rainfall, surface moisture and surface air temperature. Overall, spaceborne optical data are an invaluable source for investigating changes and variability in surface albedo in relation to surface hydrology over subarctic regions.",

NCI’s partners (CSIRO, Bureau of Meteorology, Australian National University, and Geoscience Australia), supported by the Australian Government and Research Data Storage Infrastructure (RDSI), have established a national data resource that is co-located with high-performance computing. This paper addresses the metadata management of these data assets over their lifetime.\nNCI manages 36 data collections (10+ PB) categorised as earth system sciences, climate and weather model data assets and products, earth and marine observations and products, geosciences, terrestrial ecosystem, water management and hydrology, astronomy, social science and biosciences. The data is largely sourced from NCI partners, the custodians of many of the national scientific records, and major research community organisations. The data is made available in a HPC and data-intensive environment - a ~56000 core supercomputer, virtual labs on a 3000 core cloud system, and data services. By assembling these large national assets, new opportunities have arisen to harmonise the data collections, making a powerful cross-disciplinary resource.\nTo support the overall management, a Data Management Plan (DMP) has been developed to record the workflows, procedures, the key contacts and responsibilities. The DMP has fields that can be exported to the ISO19115 schema and to the collection level catalogue of GeoNetwork. The subset or file level metadata catalogues are linked with the collection level through parent-child relationship definition using UUID. A number of tools have been developed that support interactive metadata management, bulk loading of data, and support for computational workflows or data pipelines.\nNCI creates persistent identifiers for each of the assets. The data collection is tracked over its lifetime, and the recognition of the data providers, data owners, data generators and data aggregators are updated. A Digital Object Identifier is assigned using the Australian National Data Service (ANDS). Once the data has been quality assured, a DOI is minted and the metadata record updated. NCI’s data citation policy establishes the relationship between research outcomes, data providers, and the data.",

            "abstract": "Siliceous hydrothermal breccias were sampled in two Mid-Atlantic Ridge active sites: Lucky Strike and Menez Gwen. These hydrothermal fields are located in the border of the Azorean plateau, southwest of the Azores islands where the alteration processes affecting basaltic rocks are prominent (Costa et al., 2003). The hydrothermal breccias are genetically related with the circulation of low temperature hydrothermal fluids in diffuse vents. The groundmass of these breccias precipitates from the fluid and consolidates the clastic fragments mostly composed of basalt. The main sources are the surrounding volcanic hills.\nBreccias are found near hydrothermal vents and may play an important role in the protection of subseafloor hydrothermal deposits forming an impermeable cap due to the high content in siliceous material. The amorphous silica tends to precipitate when the fluid is conductively cooled as proposed by Fouquet et al. (1998) after Fournier (1983). The process evolves gradually from an initial stage where we have just the fragments and circulating seawater. The ascending hydrothermal fluid mixes with seawater, which favours the precipitation of the sulphide components. Sealing of the initially loose fragments begins, the temperature rises below this crust, and the processes of mixing fluid circulation and conductive cooling are simultaneous. At this stage the fluid becomes oversaturated with respect to amorphous silica. This form of silica can precipitate in the open spaces of the porous sulphides and seal the system. Normally this can happen at low temperatures. At this stage the hydrothermal breccia is formed creating a progressively less permeable, eventually impermeable cap rock at the surface. Once the fluid is trapped under this impermeable layer, conductive cooling is enhanced and mixing with seawater is restricted, making the precipitation of amorphous silica more efficient.\nSince the first discovery and description of recent mineralized submarine hydrothermal deposits, comparison with ancient volcanic massive sulphide deposits is appropriate. The proposed model can explain some of the processes taking place in the early phase of formation of old deposits where equivalent siliceous material is found in the hanging wall of the ore bodies (e.g. Barriga and Fyfe, 1988).",

            "abstract": "The length of the melting season and surface albedo modulate the amount of meltwater produced over the Greenland ice sheet. The two quantities are intimately connected through a suite of non-linear processes: for example, early melting can reduce the surface albedo (through constructive grain size metamorphism), hence affecting the surface energy balance and further increasing melting. Over the past years, several studies have highlighted increased melting concurring, with a decrease of mean surface albedo over Greenland. However, few studies have examined the duration of the melting season, its implication for surface processes and linkages to climate drivers. Moreover, the majority (if not all) of the studies assessing albedo trends from spaceborne data over Greenland have focused on the last decade or so (2000 – 2013) because they use data collected over the same period by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS).\nHere, we evaluate and synthesize long-term trends in the length of the melting season (1979 - 2013) derived from spaceborne microwave observations together with surface albedo trends for the period 1982 – 2013 using data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). To our knowledge, this is the first time that trends in Greenland albedo and melt season length are discussed for the periods considered in this study. Our results point to a lengthening of the melting season as a consequence of earlier melt onset and later refreeze and to a decrease of mean albedo (1982 – 2013) over the Greenland ice sheet, with trends being spatially variable. To account for this spatial variability, the results of an analysis at regional scales over 12 different regions (defined by elevation and drainage systems) are also reported. The robustness of the results is evaluated by means of a comparative analysis of the results obtained from both AVHRR and MODIS when overlapping data are available (2000 – 2013).\nLastly, because large-scale circulation patterns and climate drivers can impact the amount of meltwater produced over Greenland (hence impacting albedo), we discuss the observed trends in the context of North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Greenland Blocking Index (GBI) using a combination of regional climate model outputs and re-analysis data.",

            "abstract": "Elevated concentrations of arsenic (As) in the groundwater of the shallow aquifers of Bangladesh are a major public health concern. Subsurface Arsenic Removal (SAR) is a relatively new treatment option that can potentially be a cost effective method for arsenic removal for community-based drinking water supplies. The basic idea of SAR is to extract water, aerate it, and re-inject it, after which groundwater with reduced arsenic concentrations may be extracted. The main process for As reduction is sorption to Hydrous Ferric Oxides (HFO) that forms after injection of the aerated water. The purpose of this poster is to investigate the major geochemical processes responsible for the (im)mobilization of As during SAR operation.\nSAR was applied at a test site in Muradnagar upazila in Comilla district about 100 km southeast of Dhaka in Bangladesh. Multiple extraction/aeration/re-injection cycles were performed and water samples were analyzed. A PHREEQC reactive transport model (RTM) was used in a radial flow setting to try to reproduce the measurements. Kinetic oxidation/dissolution reactions, cation exchange, and surface complexation were simulated. The simulation of different reactions enables the possibility to discern the reaction parameters involved in the im(mobilization) of As.\nThe model fit has reasonable agreement with the observed data for major ions and trace elements. The model suggests an increasing sorption capacity due to the gradual development of HFO precipitates resulting from the injection phases. Modeled breakthrough curves of As, Fe(II), and Mn, match the measured increase of As, Fe(II), and Mn removal with successive cycles. The model illustrates that the pH of groundwater during SAR operation has a great impact on As sorption in the subsurface. The surface complexation modeling suggests that competitive displacement of As by H4SiO4 is an important factor limiting As removal during SAR operation.",

            "abstract": "Stratospheric aerosols are derived from precursor SO2 and OCS gases transported from the lower troposphere. Volcanic injections can also enhance aerosol loadings far above background levels. The latter can exert a significant influence on the Earth’s radiation budget for major and even minor eruptions. Careful measurements are needed, therefore, to monitor the distribution and evolution of stratospheric aerosols for climate related studies.\nThe Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) mission has been acquiring profile measurements of clouds and aerosols since 2006, leading to major advances in our understanding of tropospheric aerosol and cloud properties and the processes that control them. The CALIPSO products have also enabled new insights into polar stratospheric clouds and stratospheric aerosols. Vernier et al (2009,JGR,114,D00H10) reported on the construction of a modified CALIPSO lidar product that corrected minor artifacts with the original lidar calibration that affected stratospheric aerosol investigations. A significantly improved CALIPSO Lidar Version 4 Level 1 product has been recently released addressing these calibration issues and has resulted in enhanced signal levels and a highly stable record over the span of the mission. Based on this product, a new 3D gridded stratospheric CALIPSO data product is under development and being targeted for release in 2015. A key emphasis of this new product is to bridge the measurement gap between the SAGE II and SAGE III data record (1984-2005) and the start of measurements from the new SAGE III instrument to be deployed on the International Space Station in 2016. The primary parameters delivered in the CALIPSO stratospheric data products will be attenuated scattering ratio and aerosol extinction profiles, both averaged over one month intervals and binned into an equal angle grid of constant latitude and longitude with a vertical resolution of 900m.\nWe will present the overall scheme for developing this product, as well as comparisons of our preliminary results with other datasets having temporal and spatial measurement overlaps such as OSIRIS and GOMOS and possibly OMPS. Signatures of volcanic effects and transport effects such as the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) as captured in the product will be presented.",

            "abstract": "A series of analysis modeling was performed using a behavior prediction model and a leakage risk analysis model to evaluate quantitatively impacts of hydrogeologic properties (intrinsic permeability and porosity) of storage formations (reservoir rocks) on leakage risk of deep groundwater (brine) and carbon dioxide (CO2) due to geologic CO2 storage. In this study, an abandoned well and a fault are considered as leakage pathways for deep groundwater and CO2 leakage from a storage formation into an overlying near-surface aquifer. A series of prediction modeling of behavior of deep groundwater and CO2 in the storage formation was performed first using a behavior prediction model TOUGH2 (Pruess et al., 1999, 2012) to obtain spatial and temporal distributions of the pressure, temperature, and saturation of deep groundwater and CO2 as well as the mass fraction (solubility) of CO2 in deep groundwater along the upper boundary of the storage formation beneath the overlying cap rock. These spatial and temporal distributions are used as input data in the next leakage risk analysis modeling. A series of analysis modeling of leakage risk of deep groundwater and CO2 through either the abandoned well or the fault was then performed using a leakage risk analysis model CO2-LEAK (Kim, 2012). The analysis modeling results show that CO2 injection can cause deep groundwater (brine) and CO2 (both free fluid and aqueous phases) leakage into the overlying near-surface aquifer through either the abandoned well or the fault. In that case, brine leaks first, aqueous phase of CO2 then leaks, and free fluid phase of CO2 leaks finally, whereas their leakage rates and amounts through the fault is much greater than those through the abandoned well. The analysis modeling results also reveal that the leakage rate and amount of deep groundwater are almost independent of permeability and porosity of the storage formation. However, the leakage rate and amount of CO2 are dependent on and inversely proportional to them. In addition, the leakage rate and amount of CO2 are more sensitive to permeability than porosity of the storage formation.

            "abstract": "Tropical vegetation plays an essential role for global biogeochemical cycles. An abundant literature focused on the vegetation dynamics in Amazon. It is shown that the Amazonian rainforest is strongly controlled by radiation, even during dry season. However, only few researches deal with tropical rainforest in Southeast Asia; the vegetation dynamics in Southeast Asia remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics of vegetation in Southeast Asia with three independent satellite derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) products (GIMMS AVHRR NDVI3g, SPOT, and MODIS) as well as the recently developed Sun Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF). We furthermore examined how climate drivers (precipitation, temperature and radiation) exert influences on the vegetation dynamics. We find that the three NDVI datasets are generally consistent with each other. At seasonal scale, NDVI decreases from the beginning to the end of the dry season; at interannual scale, dry season NDVI is positively correlated to precipitation but negatively correlated to radiation, while wet season NDVI is positively correlated to radiation. Compared to evergreen forests, deciduous forests have a larger NDVI decrease rate and more extended area with positive relationships between NDVI and precipitation during the dry season. SIF is lower during dry season than during wet season. Our results indicate that most forests in Southeast Asia, unlike in the Amazonian basin, are water-limited in the dry season but radiation-limited in the wet season. These results imply that droughts may have a stronger impact on forests in Southeast Asia than in Amazon.",

            "abstract": "Many major strike-slip faults are segmented along strike, including those along plate boundaries in California and Turkey. Failure of distinct fault segments at depth may be the source of multiple pulses of seismic radiation observed for single earthquakes. However, how and when segmentation affects fault behavior and energy release is the basis of many outstanding questions related to the physics of faulting and seismic hazard. These include the probability for a single earthquake to rupture multiple fault segments and the effects of segmentation on earthquake magnitude, radiated seismic energy, and ground motions. Using numerical models, we quantify components of the earthquake energy budget, including the tectonic work acting externally on the system, the energy of internal rock strain, the energy required to overcome fault strength and initiate slip, the energy required to overcome frictional resistance during slip, and the radiated seismic energy. We compare the energy budgets of systems of two en echelon fault segments with various spacing that include both releasing and restraining steps. First, we allow the fault segments to fail simultaneously and capture the effects of segmentation geometry on the earthquake energy budget and on the efficiency with which applied displacement is accommodated. Assuming that higher efficiency correlates with higher probability for a single, larger earthquake, this approach has utility for assessing the seismic hazard of segmented faults. Second, we nucleate slip along a weak portion of one fault segment and let the quasi-static rupture propagate across the system. Allowing fractures to form near faults in these models shows that damage develops within releasing steps and promotes slip along the second fault, while damage develops outside of restraining steps and can prohibit slip along the second fault. Work is consumed in both the propagation of and frictional slip along these new fractures, impacting the energy available for further slip and for subsequent earthquakes. This suite of models reveals that efficiency may be a useful tool for determining the relative seismic hazard of different segmented fault systems, while accounting for coseismic damage zone production is critical in assessing fault interactions and the associated energy budgets of specific systems.",

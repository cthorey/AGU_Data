            "abstract": "Several remotely sensed datasets are now available to detect and analyze forest disturbances. Each of these regional and global datasets is estimated with varying degrees of systematic and unsystematic error (i.e., uncertainty), and so rigorous analysis of forest disturbance requires detected changes to be accompanied by estimates of error. Currently, errors are assessed predominantly by external, post hoc validation—i.e., comparison of detected changes to independent observations that are assumed to be true. However, validation yields only broadly aggregated, regional summaries of error but does not describe its spatial and temporal variation. Alternatively, modeling the propagation of error through the processes of estimation, classification, and change-detection provides an internal means to infer classification and change-detection error at a scale equivalent to that of cover and change—i.e., at pixel resolution and global extent. Using sequential observations from the first global, Landsat-based dataset of fractional tree cover, we derive and demonstrate a rigorous, probabilistic method for propagating the uncertainty of fractional tree-cover estimates to categorical forest-cover classification and change detection. Modeling tree cover as a probability distribution in each pixel represents estimation error locally and enables its transmission into inferences such as change detection. Propagation thus enables mapping and visualization of the spatial distribution of uncertainty resulting from estimation of tree cover and from selection of the threshold of tree-cover to define “forest”. The approach described here provides a useful, per-pixel description of forest classification and change-detection certainty and can accommodate any definition of “forest” based on tree cover—an especially important consideration for monitoring disturbance, given the variety of institutional definitions of forest cover based on remotely sensible characteristics.",

            "abstract": "Biogeochemical cycling in estuaries is governed by fluxes from both riverine sources and through estuarine sediment deposits. Although estimates from river sources are relatively common and easily sampled, estimates of nutrient fluxes through the fluid-sediment interface are less common and limited to deeper portions of the bays away from intertidal areas. Lack of quantifiable shear stress estimates over intertidal areas limits our overall understanding of nutrient budgets in estuaries. Unfortunately, observation of intertidal hydrodynamics and nutrient fluxes over tidal flats and near the water’s edge is difficult owing to the temporally varying and spatially extensive region where the tides inundate, and thus numerical modeling is often employed. In this work, the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS), a three dimensional numerical hydrodynamic model was used to investigate the shear stresses over intertidal mudflats in the Great Bay, a tidally-dominated New England estuary cut by several tidal channels and with over 50% of the estuary exposed at low tide. The ROMS wetting and drying scheme was used to simulate the rising and falling tide on the flats, a successful approach adapted in other regions of the world but not always inclusive of tidal channels. Bathymetric data obtained in 2009 and 2013 was used to define the model grid. Predicted tides are forced at Adam’s Pt., a natural constriction in the estuary about 20 km upstream of the mouth and at the entrance to the Great Bay. Of particular interest are fluxes of material on-to and off-of the tidal flats which contribute to water quality conditions in the estuary, and are largely governed by shear stresses that drive nutrient fluxes at the fluid-sediment interface. Basin wide estimates of near-bottom shear stresses can be used to estimate first order nutrient fluxes over a tidal cycle and hence describe general biogeochemical dynamics of the estuary. Future work will include enhanced forcing of currents by winds and wave processes at the shallow edges of the estuary. This research was supported by UNH College of Engineering and Physical Sciences fellowship and ONR.",

            "abstract": "Understanding and prediction of snowmelt generated streamflow at sub-daily time scales is important for reservoir scheduling and climate change characterization. This is particularly important in the Western U.S. where over 50 - 70% of water supply is provided by snowmelt during the melting period. Previous studies reported that daily peak flow timing might shift earlier in some basins, but later in others during the melt season. This shift of peak flow timing was attributed to three crucial processes: translation time of liquid water flux through snowpack, translation time from the base of snowpacks to river channels, and translation time in the river channels to stream gage stations. Here we evaluate our ability to simulate the sub-daily streamflow peak time and quantitatively explore the relative contribution from each individual factor. Our analysis shows that the timing of the daily peak is dominantly controlled by melt translation time from the bottom of snowpack to the river channel, while the seasonal variation in daily peak is influenced the most by translation time through the snow pack. An additional factor, the increasing trend of temperature and radiation in melt season, is also contributing to the timing of peak streamflow and its variations.",

            "abstract": "Tropical regions act as an important carbon (C) sink resulting in partial mitigation of the increased carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere. The C sink capacity is constrained by the nutrient availability particularly of phosphorus (P) which is strongly bound to iron and aluminum oxides in highly weathered tropical soils. However, most ecosystem models neglect the P limitation mechanism that can result in overestimation of the C uptake in the terrestrial biosphere. In this study, we incorporated a P module into the process based model, the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM 2.0) used it to estimate the net carbon exchange (NCE: net primary productivity – heterotrophic respiration) in the tropics during 1901–2010. Specific objectives of the research are to determine the spatial and temporal patterns of NCE in the context of multiple environmental changes (e. g. land cover and land use change, elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, climate, and atmospheric nitrogen deposition) as well as to quantify the magnitude of carbon uptake inhibited by P limitation in pan tropics during 1901–2010. The simulation results from DLEM 2.0 were validated against field observations on carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus ratios in the foliage and plant litter pools in different geographical locations across the globe. This abstract will be updated with the results in the next few months. Our results will provide insights into P limitation influence on C uptake in the tropics.",

            "abstract": "The national parks of southern Utah are home to a number of spectacular landmarks that draw visitors from across the world. However, there is currently no methodology in place to evaluate the structural health of these structures as they change through time or in the wake of a damaging event. Our study combines in-situ ambient vibration measurements with 3D numerical modeling to monitor the resonance characteristics of Mesa Arch, a prominent arch in Canyonlands National Park. We measure spectral and polarization attributes of ambient vibrations using two broadband seismometers: one placed on the arch and the other located at a distance of ~100 m for reference. Repeat measurements, ranging in duration from 1 hour to 3 days, are aimed at assessing short- and long-term changes in resonance characteristics, which in turn provide evidence of internal mechanical change. Numerical modal analysis, executed by inputting geometric and representative material properties of the arch into 3D modeling software, allows us to match the measured fundamental frequency as well as higher-order modes. Preliminary results suggest minor variations in resonant frequencies are predominantly controlled by thermal effects, i.e. changes in bulk material stiffness as the rock expands and contracts.",

            "abstract": "Large woody debris (LWD) has become universally recognized as an integral component of fluvial systems, and as a result, has become increasingly common as a river restoration tool. However, “natural” processes of wood recruitment and the subsequent arrangement of LWD within the river network are poorly understood. This research used a suite of spatial statistics to investigate longitudinal arrangement patterns of LWD in a low-gradient, Midwestern river. First, a large-scale GPS inventory of LWD, performed on the Big River in the eastern Missouri Ozarks, resulted in over 4,000 logged positions of LWD along seven river segments that covered nearly 100 km of the 237 km river system. A global Moran’s I analysis indicates that LWD density is spatially autocorrelated and displays a clustering tendency within all seven river segments (P-value range = 0.000 to 0.054). A local Moran’s I analysis identified specific locations along the segments where clustering occurs and revealed that, on average, clusters of LWD density (high or low) spanned 400 m. Spectral analyses revealed that, in some segments, LWD density is spatially periodic. Two segments displayed strong periodicity, while the remaining segments displayed varying degrees of noisiness. Periodicity showed a positive association with gravel bar spacing and meander wavelength, although there were insufficient data to statistically confirm the relationship. A wavelet analysis was then performed to investigate periodicity relative to location along the segment. The wavelet analysis identified significant (α = 0.05) periodicity at discrete locations along each of the segments. Those reaches yielding strong periodicity showed stronger relationships between LWD density and the geomorphic/riparian independent variables tested. Analyses consistently identified valley width and sinuosity as being associated with LWD density. The results of these analyses contribute a new perspective on the longitudinal distribution of LWD in a river system, which should help identify physical and/or riparian control mechanisms of LWD arrangement and support the development of models of LWD arrangement. Additionally, the spatial statistical tools presented here have shown to be valuable for identifying longitudinal patterns in river system components.",

            "abstract": "Seismic sensors such as geophones and fiber optic have been increasingly recognized as promising technologies for intelligence surveillance, including intruder detection and perimeter defense systems. Geophone arrays have the capability to provide cost effective intruder detection in protecting assets with large perimeters. A seismic intruder detection system uses one or multiple arrays of geophones design to record seismic signals from footsteps and ground vehicles. Using a series of real-time signal processing algorithms the system detects, classify and monitors the intruder’s movement.\nWe have carried out numerical experiments to demonstrate the capability of a seismic array to detect moving targets that generate seismic signals. The seismic source is modeled as a vertical force acting on the ground that generates continuous impulsive seismic signals with different predominant frequencies. Frequency-wave number analysis of the synthetic array data was used to demonstrate the array’s capability at accurately determining intruder’s movement direction. The performance of the array was also analyzed in detecting two or more objects moving at the same time. One of the drawbacks of using a single array system is its inefficiency at detecting seismic signals deflected by large underground objects. We will show simulation results of the effect of an underground concrete block at shielding the seismic signal coming from an intruder. Based on simulations we found that multiple small arrays can greatly improve the system’s detection capability in the presence of underground structures.\nThis work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344",

            "abstract": "The recent discovery of an apparent plume erupting from Europa’s surface using data from the Hubble Space Telescope (Roth et al. 2014) has prompted renewed interest in the possibility of recent or ongoing geologic activity on Europa. Here we summarize previous searches for plumes and changes on Europa’s surface, and make recommendations for future efforts.\nDuring the period of time in which the Galileo spacecraft was in orbit in the Jupiter system, we made a number of comparisons with observations taken 20 years earlier by the Voyager spacecraft to look for surface changes (Phillips et al. 2000). We found no changes which were visible on Europa’s surface. These comparisons, however, were necessarily limited by the low resolution of the Voyager images, which had a maximum resolution of about 2 km/pixel.\nWe also used Galileo spacecraft data to search for plumes of material being ejected from Europa’s surface. A 30-image observation was taken in 1999 to observe the limb and the dark sky just off the limb in a search for active plumes, but no plumes were observed (Phillips et al. 2000). However, Hoppa et al (1999) suggested that this image sequence occurred under unfavorable tidal stress conditions. Plume searches were also performed in eclipse images, but again no plumes were detected.\nMore recently, we compared global-scale images of Europa taken in 2007 by the New Horizons spacecraft during its Jupiter flyby en route to Pluto (Bramson et al. 2011). After a careful search that included the iterative coregistration and ratioing techniques developed by Phillips et al. (2000), again, no changes were found on Europa’s surface.\nIf the recent Roth et al. (2014) suggestions of an active plume on Europa prove to be correct, we infer that one of two possibilities must be the case. Either 1) the plume is a recent event and was not active before the 2007 New Horizons flyby; or 2) the plume is intermittent and low-density, consisting primarily of gas and not dust, and therefore results in little to no detectable surface deposits on Europa.\n",

            "abstract": "The tectonic setting during formation of the Oman-UAE ophiolite is debated. High precision 206Pb/238U zircon dates from gabbros indicate that ridge magmatism responsible for formation of most of the ophiolite crust occurred between ~96.0–95.5 Ma. Here we present new high precision 206Pb/238U zircon dates and whole-rock Nd isotopic data from three rock sequences that constrain the development of thrusting/subduction below the ophiolite: 1. The V2 volcanic sequence and associated plutonic rocks in the ophiolite have geochemical patterns that have been interpreted as a subduction signature. V2 plutonic rocks from both Oman and the UAE have dates of ~95.6–95.0 Ma, consistent with rapid development of thrusting/subduction following formation of the ophiolite crust. 2. Felsic plutonic rocks with εNd < 0 intrude residual mantle harzburgites below the crust-mantle boundary, consistent with derivation of the magmas from a source with time-integrated LREE enrichment, such as continental crust or terrigenous sedimentary rocks. Dates on these rocks in Oman range from ~95.5–95.0, consistent with synchronous thrusting of continent derived rocks below the ophiolite during V2 magmatism. Similar intrusive rocks from the UAE are younger, ranging from ~94–91 Ma, indicating a more protracted history of thrusting and melting in this area. 3. Amphibolite facies metamorphic rocks in the sole of the ophiolite are interpreted as crust thrust beneath the ophiolite during formation or emplacement. Garnet amphibolites and small leucocratic (?) pods and veins from sole exposures in Oman are 96.0–94.7 Ma. The oldest dates are synchronous with ridge magmatism and suggest some sole amphibolites underwent metamorphism and melting while the ridge was active, favoring a supra-subduction zone model for ophiolite formation. Rocks from sole exposures in the UAE are slightly younger, ranging from 94.5–92.5 Ma. In summary, the data strongly support a supra-subduction zone model for formation of the ophiolite. If, as has been proposed, the ophiolite formed during subduction initiation, the new dates provide an unprecedented record of this process, which can be used to test and constrain geodynamic models.",

            "abstract": "The mechanisms controlling rupture propagation between fault segments during an earthquake are key to the hazard posed by fault systems. Rupture initiation on a fault segment sometimes transfers to a larger fault, resulting in a significant event (e.g.i, 2002 M7.9Denali and 2010 M7.1 Darfield earthquakes). In other cases rupture is constrained to the initial segment and does not transfer to nearby faults, resulting in events of moderate magnitude. This is the case of the 1989 M6.9 Loma Prieta and 2010 M7.0 Haiti earthquakes which initiated on reverse faults abutting against a major strike-slip plate boundary fault but did not propagate onto it. Here we investigatethe rupture dynamics of the Haiti earthquake, seeking to understand why rupture propagated across two segments of the Léogâne fault but did not propagate to the adjacenent Enriquillo Plantain Garden Fault, the major 200 km long plate boundary fault cutting through southern Haiti. We use a Finite Element Model to simulate the nucleation and propagation of rupture on the Léogâne fault, varying friction and background stress to determine the parameter set that best explains the observed earthquake sequence. The best-fit simulation is in remarkable agreement with several finite fault inversions and predicts ground displacement in very good agreement with geodetic and geological observations. The two slip patches inferred from finite-fault inversions are explained by the successive rupture of two fault segments oriented favorably with respect to the rupture propagation, while the geometry of the Enriquillo fault did not allow shear stress to reach failure. Although our simulation results replicate well the ground deformation consistent with the geodetic surface observation but convolving the ground motion with the soil amplification from the microzonation study will correctly account for the heterogeneity of the PGA throughout the rupture area.",

            "abstract": "Repeating earthquakes occur in the vicinity of creeping sections along the Parkfield section of the San Andreas fault (Nadeau et al., 1995) and the Anza section of the San Jacinto fault (Taira, 2013). Uilizing an empirical Green’s function (eGF) approach for both the Parkfield and Anza events, we are able to conduct a comparative study of the resulting slip distributions and source parameters to examine differences in the scaling of fault dimension, average slip, and peak-slip with magnitude. Following the approach of Dreger et al. (2007), moment rate functions (MRFs) are obtained at each station for both Parkfield and Anza earthquakes using a spectral domain deconvolution approach where the complex spectrum of the eGF is divided out of the complex spectrum of the target event. Spatial distributions of fault slip are derived by inverting the MRFs, and the coseismic stress change is computed following the method of Ripperger and Mai (2004). Initial results are based on the analysis of several Parkfield target events ranging in magnitude from Mw1.8 to 6.0 (Dreger et al., 2011) and a Mw4.7 Anza event. Parkfield peak slips are consistent with the Nadeau and Johnson (1998) tectonic loading model, while average slips tend to scale self-similarly. Results for the Anza event show very high peak and average slips, in exceedance of 50 cm and 10 cm respectively. Directivity for this event is in the northwest direction, and preliminary sensitivity analyses suggest that the rupture velocity is near the shear wave velocity and the rise time is short (~0.03 sec). Multiple eGFs for the Anza event have been evaluated and the results appear robust.",

ASCEM is an open source and modular computing framework that incorporates new advances and tools for predicting contaminant fate and transport in natural and engineered systems. The ASCEM toolset includes both a Platform with Integrated Toolsets (called Akuna) and a High-Performance Computing multi-process simulator (called Amanzi). The focus of this presentation is on Akuna, an open-source user environment that manages subsurface simulation workflows and associated data and metadata. In this presentation, key elements of Akuna are demonstrated, which includes toolsets for model setup, database management, sensitivity analysis, parameter estimation, uncertainty quantification, and visualization of both model setup and simulation results. A key component of the workflow is in the automated job launching and monitoring capabilities, which allow a user to submit and monitor simulation runs on high-performance, parallel computers. Visualization of large outputs can also be performed without moving data back to local resources. These capabilities make high-performance computing accessible to the users who might not be familiar with batch queue systems and usage protocols on different supercomputers and clusters.",

            "abstract": "One of the greatest global challenges is to meet growing food demand under rapidly changing climate conditions. Continued global population growth increases the pressure on the agriculture sector to produce enough food to feed the world. In 2013, the province of Alberta, Canada, set a record high for principal field crop production of 34.5 million tonnes (Matejovsky, 2014). AquaCrop, a crop yield and water productivity model developed by the Land and Water Division of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), attempts to balance the accuracy, simplicity and robustness of crop modelling (Steduto et al., 2009). The model is focused on the three components of the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. AquaCrop is applied in this study for simulating hard red spring wheat and durum wheat yields, and simulated yields are verified against observed yields available from a crop insurer. One of the challenges of crop yield modelling is the selection of a realistic seeding date, which can vary by four to five weeks (end of March to end of April). In order to enable realistic simulation for the historical period 1950-2010 as well the future period 2041-2070, AquaCrop is coupled with the ACRU agro-hydrological modelling system to determine the soil moisture conditions after the spring snow melt, and with a WMO climate index which determines the climatological beginning of the growing season. Therefore, the selection of a realistic seeding data for individual years can be dynamically optimized, based on the combination of the beginning of the climatological growing season and soil moisture status. The results of the coupling of ACRU and calculated climate indices with AquaCrop will be presented to show how improvements of parameterization of the AquaCrop model can be used to simulate wheat yields in Southern Alberta under changing climate conditions.",

            "abstract": "Among other applications, remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) has become critical for monitoring the surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect in cities across the world. While daily MODIS thermal infrared data is invaluable for examining changes in LST over time, the large 1 km spatial resolution makes studying the spatial patterns of LST in a heterogeneous urban environment difficult. The 120 m spatial resolution of Landsat 4-5 TM, as well the archive of data stretching back to 1982, make Landsat 4-5 TM sensors valuable resources for thermal data, especially in urban areas. However, the difficulty accurately correcting for atmospheric effects with only one thermal band, as well as the necessity for a priori knowledge of land surface emissivity (LSE), mean it is underutilized. Research to determine best practices for deriving LST from Landsat TM data given homogenous, usually vegetated land cover is relatively extensive; however, the accuracy of these methods given heterogeneous land cover is less well known, especially given Land Surface Emissivity (LSE) calculations that often rely heavily on NDVI. In order to determine the best methodology for measuring LST across heterogeneous land cover in the central United States, this study derives LST from Landsat 5 TM band 6 for Oklahoma City and the surrounding countryside on a fall and a spring date using three different methods: no atmospheric correction, the radiative transfer equation, and the mono-window algorithm. With all three methods, the common NDVI-based approach for estimating LSE is used; a fourth LST calculation with no atmospheric correction and an assumed emissivity of one is therefore included as contrast. Using regression analysis, these four LST measurements are compared to air temperatures recorded concurrently by approximately 40 Oklahoma Mesonet stations across the study area, and results are broken down by land cover type to explore potential biases or variations in accuracy.",

            "abstract": "A recently completed, hydraulically fractured, well in Southern Oklahoma revealed a strong temporal correlation between injection parameters and the occurrence of earthquakes distinct from the background rates of seismicity. While this area of Southern Oklahoma has a low level of background seismicity, about 10 located events per year, there have been 43 earthquakes located in the area during 2014. Of the recent events, 29 coincide, in time and space, with the 2-day hydraulic fracturing of this well, while an additional 31 events have been identified through waveform cross-correlation and extend the magnitude of completeness down to 1.5ML. The majority of events that have been manually located are under magnitude 2.5ML, at depths of ~ 3.5 to 8.5 km and are within 1-7 km of the well. There are 6 stations within 90 km from the center of the seismicity with fair azimuthal coverage, the nearest seismic station is 25 km away, and while not ideal, the locations appear to be well constrained. The largest event located was a magnitude 3.2ML, located ~ 4.5 km southwest of the well, ~7.3 km depth, and occurred approximately 100 minutes after fracturing began. By plotting the pressures measured at wellhead and the discharge rates through time we are able to see a strong correlation with the seismicity and the stages of hydraulic fracturing. Our strong temporal correlation between injection parameters and the occurrence of earthquakes, distinct from the background rates of seismicity, along with the relatively close spatial proximity to the well do suggest a causal link. What remains to be explained is the apparent significant spatial offset between the stimulated well and the earthquakes coupled with the short time between the stimulation of the well and the onset of seismicity. Greater geotechnical information will be required to both address or improve earthquake location uncertainties as well as geomechanical considerations as to how this sequence of earthquakes may have been triggered by hydraulic fracturing and what information we can ascertain about Earth properties in the area from this occurrence.",

            "abstract": "The San-Jacinto Fault (SJF) is the most active fault in southern California, which together with the southern San-Andreas Fault accommodates a large fraction of the motion across the plate boundary. Seismicity along the SJF is distributed over several fault segments with distinct spatio-temporal characteristics. One of these segments, known as the Anza seismic gap, is a 25 km long strand almost devoid of seismicity. In recent years, four M4-5 events occurred SE of the gap. Despite their moderate magnitudes, these earthquakes triggered rich aftershock sequences and pronounced afterslip that lasted for several weeks, and was well captured by nearby PBO borehole strain meters. A similar transient was remotely triggered by the 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake. Geodetic and seismic observations following a local M5.4 mainshock indicate that afterslip propagated unilaterally towards the NW at speed of about 5 km/day. We infer the distribution of slip via a joint inversion of the aftershock and strain data. Our approach is based on Dieterich's (1994) model relating the evolution of seismicity rate to applied stresses, within the framework of rate-and-state friction. This approach provides resolution power at depths inaccessible to the surface geodetic network. Moreover, it allows us to gain important insights onto the fault mechanical properties. We apply this inversion scheme to episodes that occurred during 2010. Remarkably, we find that the cumulative moment released post-seismically during the locally triggered transient is 5-10 times larger than the moment of the mainshock. We show that the data favour a model in which deep slip transients, which may develop due to local or remote earthquakes, occur on a weak, close-to-velocity-neutral fault. The transients increase the stress along the Anza gap, and trigger earthquakes outside it through static stress transfer.",

Multiple repeated observations are required to observe the effects of changing environmental conditions on vegetation. This study examines the use of optical signals to determine inputs to a light use efficiency (LUE) model describing productivity of a cornfield where repeated observations of carbon flux, spectral reflectance and fluorescence were collected. Data were collected at the Optimizing Production Inputs for Economic and Environmental Enhancement (OPE3) fields (39.03°N, 76.85°W) at USDA Beltsville Agricultural Research Center. Agricultural Research Service researchers measured CO2 fluxes using eddy covariance methods throughout the growing season. Optical measurements were made from the nearby tower supporting the NASA FUSION sensors. The sensor system consists of two dual channel, upward and downward looking, spectrometers used to simultaneously collect high spectral resolution measurements of reflected and fluoresced light from vegetation canopies. Estimates of chlorophyll fluorescence, combined with measures of vegetation pigment content and the Photosynthetic Reflectance Index (PRI) derived from the spectral reflectance are compared with CO2 fluxes over diurnal periods for multiple days. PRI detects changes in Xanthophyll cycle pigments using reflectance at 531 nm compared to a reference band at 570 nm. The relationships among the different optical measurements indicate that they are providing different types of information on the vegetation and that combinations of these measurements provide improved retrievals of CO2 fluxes than any index alone.",

            "abstract": "It is well understood that there exists a relationship between mountainous snowpack and seasonal streamflow. For snow-dominated river basins within the western United States, ~ 80% of streamflow is a result of seasonal snowmelt. In Idaho, where a significant amount of winter precipitation is stored as snowpack, predictions for the timing and magnitude of peak streamflow are essential for many water users, including water resource and irrigation managers. Of particular interest is the relationship between the timing of snowmelt and the timing of peak streamflow. While agencies such as the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) are tasked with the responsibility of providing water supply forecasts, few methods have used a data-driven, empirical modeling approach to investigate relationships between ablation timing monitored by the NRCS SNOTEL program and streamflow monitored by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Such analyses could provide predictive tools that allow water users and managers to easily access and interpret information about peak streamflow. Idaho hosts over 80 SNOTEL sites that report hydrometeorological data, and 213 streamflow gauging stations. The goal of this study is to establish relationships between the timing of ablation at SNOTEL stations and peak streamflow within select basins in Idaho, and to synthesize results into user-friendly visualization tools that will provide estimates of the probability that peak streamflow will occur within a certain number of days as ablation progresses from 0 to 100%. In our initial test basin, the Boise River basin, we evaluated melt-out levels in increments of 10% from three SNOTEL sites located in the basin and produced cumulative density function (CDF) curves to illustrate the probability of peak streamflow occurring within a given number of days from the date at which the SNOTEL site reached each melt-out level.",

            "abstract": "Surface temperature is among the most important variables in the surface energy balance equation and it significantly affects the atmospheric boundary layer structure, the turbulent heat exchange and, over ice, the ice growth rate. Here we measure the surface temperature using thermal infrared sensors from 10-12 µm wavelength, a method whose primary limitation over sea ice is the detection of clouds. However, in the Arctic and around Antarctica there are very few conventional observations of surface temperature from buoys, and it is sometimes difficult to determine if the temperature is measured at the surface or within the snowpack, the latter of which often results in a warm bias. To reduce this bias, much interest is being paid to alternative remote sensing methods for monitoring high latitude surface temperature. We used Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) global area coverage (GAC) data to produce a high latitude sea surface temperature (SST), ice surface temperature (IST) and ice cap skin temperature dataset spanning 27 years (1982-2009). This long-term climate record is the first of its kind for IST.\nIn this project we used brightness temperatures from the infrared channels of AVHRR sensors aboard NOAA and Metop polar-orbiting satellites. Surface temperatures were calculated using separate split window algorithms for day SST, night SST, and IST. The snow surface emissivity across all angles of the swath were simulated specifically for all sensors using an emission model. Additionally, all algorithms were tuned to the Arctic using simulated brightness temperatures from a radiative transfer model with atmospheric profiles and skin temperatures from European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts (ECMWF) re-analysis data (ERA-Interim). Here we present the results of product quality as compared to in situ measurements from buoys and infrared radiometers, as well as a preliminary analysis of climate trends revealed by the record.",

            "abstract": "Birmingham is built on a complex sequence of Middle Pleistocene sediments, representing at least three lowland glaciations (MIS12, MIS6, and MIS2). British Geological Survey mapping accounts 75% of the land mass as Quaternary deposits; predominantly glacial-sandy tills, glacial-fluvial sands, clays and organic silts and peats. Understanding the age of fluvial-glacial outwash, related to specific glaciations, is critical in establishing a Geochronology of Birmingham. Shotton (1953) found a series of Middle Pleistocene glacial sediments, termed the Wolstonian, intermediate in age between MIS11 and MIS5e Interglacial’s. Uncertainty surrounding the relation to East Anglian sequences developed by Rose (1987) implies Birmingham sequences should be referred to MIS12. Despite this, younger Middle Pleistocene glacial sequences occur in Birmingham, yet uncertainty has deepened over our understanding of the complex, inaccessible sediments, especially as deposits have similar extent with MIS2 sequences. Five Optical Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dates from three sites around Birmingham have been sampled. East of Birmingham, ice advanced from the Irish Sea and later the North East. In Wolston, a sample of outwash sand, associated with the Thurssington Till, is dated. In Meriden, two samples of outwash sands, associated with a distal Oadby Till, are dated. West of Birmingham, ice advanced from the Welsh Ice Sheet. In Seisdon, two samples of an Esker and outwash sand, associated with a Ridgeacre Till, are dated. Correlation of OSL dates provide an important constraint on understanding the history of Birmingham. Using GSI3D modeling to correlate geochronology and sedimentology, the significance of OSL dating can be understood within the complex sequences (and regional stratigraphy), complimented by Cosmogenic and Palynology dates taken in South West and North East. OSL dating on Birmingham’s outwash sands, deposited by extensive repeated Middle Pleistocene glaciations, asserts the Wolstonian Glaciation was present in Birmingham during MIS6, this contributes hugely to debate surrounding the timing of glaciations in East Anglia and across the UK. This has a wider significance due to East Anglia sequences being associated with sequences in the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany (Rose, 2009; Lee et al, 2012).",

            "abstract": "The largest estuary on the west coast of North America, San Francisco Bay is an ecosystem of enormous biodiversity, and also enormous human impact. The benthos has experienced dredging, occupation by invasive species, and over a century of sediment input as a result of hydraulic mining. Although the Bay’s great cultural and ecological importance has inspired numerous surveys of the benthic macrofauna, to date there has been almost no investigation of the microbial communities on the Bay floor. An understanding of those microbial communities would contribute significantly to our understanding of both the biogeochemical processes (which are driven by the microbiota) and the physical processes (which contribute to microbial distributions) in the Bay.\nHere, we present the first broad survey of bacterial and archaeal taxa in the sediments of the San Francisco Bay. We conducted 16S rRNA community sequencing of bacteria and archaea in sediment samples taken bimonthly for one year, from five sites spanning the salinity gradient between Suisun and Central Bay, in order to capture the effect of both spatial and temporal environmental variation on microbial diversity. From the same samples we also conducted deep sequencing of a nitrogen-cycling functional gene, nirS, allowing an assessment of evolutionary diversity at a much finer taxonomic scale within an important and widespread functional group of bacteria. We paired these sequencing projects with extensive geochemical metadata as well as information about macrofaunal distribution.\nOur data reveal a diversity of distinct biogeographical patterns among different taxa: clades ubiquitous across sites; clades that respond to measurable environmental drivers; and clades that show geographical site-specificity. These community datasets allow us to test the hypothesis that salinity is a major driver of both overall microbial community structure and community structure of the denitrifying bacteria specifically; and to assess whether patterns of diversity observed at the broadest of taxonomic scales also apply to patterns observed within a single extremely diverse gene (nirS). In sum, this project provides a first look at the forces driving the migration and selection of microbial communities in San Francisco Bay.",

            "abstract": "C4 grasses currently cover ~18% of the earth’s surface and are economically important as food sources, but their distributions are likely to change with future climate changes. As a result of the opposing impacts of atmospheric CO2 and temperature on C3 and C4 physiology, future changes to the productivity and distributions of these grasses have remained unclear. We have used past and present tooth enamel, collagen, and bone carbon isotope ratios (δ13C) of Bison and Mammoth grazers to record the δ13C values of their diet, and the abundance of C3 and C4 vegetation in these habitats. Thus, the δ13C values of bison and mammoth tissues serve as a proxy for vegetation composition across North America through time. We combine these isotope data with ensemble CMIP5 climate model outputs, eight different climatic and fire predictor variables and advanced statistical techniques to model the spatial distribution of C3 and C4 grasses up through the year 2100 for two different emissions scenarios. Using the Random Forest algorithm, our model explains 91% of the spatial and temporal isotopic variability in bison and mammoth tissues and infers that mean summer temperature is the strongest predictor of all climate variables. For the emission scenario RCP4.5, in which atmospheric CO2 levels are predicted to rise to ~540 ppm by 2100, we find decreases in the abundance of C4 grasses of up to 30% in the south-central Great Plains and the Florida peninsula, and increases of up to 50% in the northern Great Plains. For the RCP8.5 scenario, in which atmospheric CO2 levels are expected to rise to ~930 ppm by 2100, our model predicts minor decreases in the abundance of C4 grasses in Texas and Oklahoma, but increases of 30-50% over the majority of the Great Plains. The overall effect of these changes is a homogenization of the Great Plains ecoregion in terms of grassland type distributions, and the loss of the highest abundance of C4 ecosystems of the panhandles of Texas, Oklahoma and western Kansas. These results have important implications for future changes to insect and mammalian biodiversity and trophic interactions across the Great Plains of North America.",

            "abstract": "Crevasses exist throughout many ice shelves as a precursor of large calving events which serve as the main source of mass loss for most ice sheets and glaciers. The stability of an ice shelf depend largely on whether the crevasses can grow and penetrate the entire ice thickness or will be filled with ice and eventually disappear. In light of recent observations of basal crevasses hundreds of meters wide, we use a finite element model to relax this condition and examine the effect that large basal crevasses have on the velocity and stress field within the ice shelf. The relative strength between the tensile stress pulling a crevasse open and the opposing hydrostatic pressure drawing ice in to heal can serve as a valuable proxy for determining the evolution of a crevasse, thus allowing us to infer regions vulnerable to fracture and those that are more stable based on ice shelf velocity and thickness measurements.",

It is said that about 10% of CH4sources is paddy fields (IPCC AR4, 2007). In this study, methane emission from a single-rice crop field was estimated by long-term micrometeorological measurements. Methane emission was calculated by the aerodynamic gradient technique from January 2011 to August 2014. Intermittent water management was carried out during cultivation period at the observational site, HCH, located in Okayama, Japan. 3-days flood and 4-days drained condition were regularly repeated from late-June to early October.\nSeasonal variations of CH4flux for irrigation term from 2011 to 2013 were shown in Fig.1.\nRemarkably large fluxes were shown at early stage of irrigation term in 2011.It seemed to be caused by the relatively longer flooded condition that the first flooded period was 20 days.\nFlux in 2012 was smaller than in other year through the entire irrigation period. Rapid rise in flux for early August and gradual decrease between late August and September were shown in 2013. Fluxes under drained condition showed larger emission than under flooded condition.

            "abstract": "Slow slip events (SSEs) in Cascadia occur at ~30-50 km depth, every 10-19 months, and typically involve slip of a few cm, producing surface displacements on the order of a few mm up to ~1cm. There is a well-known association between tremor and SSEs; however, there are more frequent tremor episodes that are not clearly associated with geodetically detected SSEs (Wech and Creager 2011). This motivates the question: Are there smaller SSE signals that we are currently not recognizing geodetically? Most existing methods to investigate transient deformation with continuous GPS (cGPS) data employ kinematic, smoothed approaches to fit the cGPS data, limiting SSE identification and characterization.\nRecently, Haines et al. (submitted) showed that Vertical Derivatives of Horizontal Stress (VDoHS) rates, calculated from GPS data by solving the force balance equations at the Earth’s surface, represent the most inclusive and spatially compact surface expressions of subsurface deformation sources: VDoHS rate vectors are tightly localized above the sources and point in the direction of push or pull. We adapt this approach, previously applied to campaign GPS data in New Zealand (e.g., Dimitrova et al. 2013), to daily cGPS time series from Cascadia and compare our results with those from the Network Inversion Filter (NIF) for 2009 (Bartlow et al. 2011). In both NIF and VDoHS rate inversions, the main 2009 SSE pulse reaches a peak slip value and splits into northern and southern sections. However, our inversion shows that the SSE started prior to July 27-28, compared to August 6-7 from the NIF results. Furthermore, we detect a smaller (~1 mm surface displacement) event from June 29-July 7 in southern Cascadia, which had not been identified previously.\nVDoHS rates also reveal the boundaries between the locked and unlocked portions of the megathrust, and we can track how this varies throughout the SSE cycle. Above the locked interface, the pull of the subducted plate generates shear tractions in the overlying plate in the direction of subduction, while above the creeping section shear tractions are in the opposite direction, which is reflected in the VDoHS rates. We show that sections of the Cascadia megathrust unlock prior to some SSEs and lock thereafter, with the locked zone propagating downdip and eastward after the SSEs over weeks to months.",

            "abstract": "The habitability of polar desert environments on Earth, and other neighboring planets, is dependent on the availability of liquid water. In areas where the surface is frozen, lenses of water present in the subsurface may act as microbial refugia. In the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, the presence of highly saline brine in valley lakes raises the potential for the existence of a deep groundwater network. We report on a geophysical study that shows Lake Vida, in Victoria Valley, is nearly frozen, and the remaining brine is confined beneath thick ice. Near surface, bathymetric mapping of grounded lake ice was accomplished from a series of ground penetrating radar surveys. Radar penetration was limited to 20 m. An airborne transient electromagnetic survey (AEM) revealed a low resistivity zone at 30-100 m depth beneath the surface of the lake. Based on previous knowledge of brine chemistry and local geology, this zone is interpreted as brine saturated unconsolidated sediments with a porosity of 23-42%. Brine volume is calculated at 15 to 32 million cubic meters, which is of similar magnitude to the brine volume in nearby saline lakes. The AEM survey provided a means of quantifying the spatial extent of deep subsurface brine in this remote environment, and has provided a new perspective on the potential for subsurface habitats in areas often considered devoid of life.",

These include the Mole sub-system, for storing relevant event data in a MySQL database (see M. Quintiliani and S. Pintore, SRL, 2013), and an embedded webserver, Moleserv, for serving such data to web clients in QuakeML format. These modules have enabled, for the first time using Earthworm, the use of web applications for seismic data processing. These can greatly simplify the operation and maintenance of seismic data processing centers by having one or more servers providing the relevant data as well as the data processing applications themselves to client machines running arbitrary operating systems.\n\nWeb applications with secure online web access allow operators to work anywhere, without the often cumbersome and bandwidth hungry use of secure shell or virtual private networks. Furthermore, web applications can seamlessly access third party data repositories to acquire additional information, such as maps. Finally, the usage of HTML email brought the possibility of specialized web applications, to be used in email clients. This is the case of EWHTMLEmail, which produces event notification emails that are in fact simple web applications for plotting relevant seismic data.\n\nProviding web services as part of Earthworm has enabled a number of other tools as well. One is ISTI’s EZ Earthworm, a web based command and control system for an otherwise command line driven system; another is a waveform web service. The waveform web service serves Earthworm data to additional web clients for plotting, picking, and other web-based processing tools. The current Earthworm waveform web service hosts an advanced plotting capability for providing views of event-based waveforms from a Mole database served by Moleserve.\nThe current trend towards the usage of cloud services supported by web applications is driving improvements in JavaScript, css and HTML, as well as faster and more efficient web browsers, including mobile. It is foreseeable that in the near future, web applications are as powerful and efficient as native applications. Hence the work described here has been the first step towards bringing the Open Source Earthworm seismic data processing system to this new paradigm.",

These reconsiderations provide further motivation for studying the nature of the field when core convection was predominantly related to core mantle boundary heat flow. Here we examine the ca. 2.575 Ga Great Dyke of Zimbabwe. We rely on deep drill core samples, eliminating the otherwise pervasive effects of lightning seen in surface samples. We apply single silicate crystal paleointensity (SCP) techniques (Tarduno et al., Rev. Geophys., 2006) on feldspars separated from orthopyroxene gabbros (norites). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analyses indicate the presence of rare sub-micron equant to slightly elongate magnetic inclusions in the feldspars. The magnetite/titanomagnetite needles commonly observed in feldspars of slowly cooled igneous rocks are rarely observed in crystals from our Great Dyke gabbro samples. Selection criteria of crystals for analyses required feldspar crystals to be free of visible multi-domain inclusions. Natural remanent magnetic intensities of ca. 1 mm-sized feldspar crystal are relatively weak (approximately 1-2 x 10-8 emu), but well within the measurement range of the University of Rochester small bore ultra-high moment resolution 2G DC SQUID magnetometer. Preliminary total thermal demagnetization experiments suggest paleofield values within 50% of those of the present-day, similar to other results that imply a relatively strong magnetic field during the late Archean. Results from Thellier analyses will be used to test this interpretation.",

To determine the impact of bromine on photochemical loss of atmospheric ozone, the contribution to total column BrO from the troposphere and stratosphere must be accurately assessed. In a 2010 study, Salawitch et al. recommended that an additional 5 to 10 ppt supply of very short lived (VSL) bromocarbons to stratospheric inorganic bromine (Bry­) is necessary to accurately represent the variation of total column BrO with total column O3. This recommendation will be reevaluated in light of total column BrO measurements obtained over Fairbanks, Alaska using a multifunction differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MFDOAS) instrument and the Pandora spectrometer system. Additionally, the impact of modifications to the kinetics regulating the partitioning between BrO and BrONO2 proposed by Kreycy et al. (2013) on the current VSL Bry estimate will be explored. Finally, we will evaluate the impact of our new understanding of VSL Bry on the tropospheric residual BrO that is inferred from OMI BrO.",

            "abstract": "A number of geophysical studies have been carried out along the San Andreas Fault (SAF) in the Northern Gabilan Range (NGR)\nwith\n the\n purpose\n of\ncharacterizing in detail the fault zone structure. Previous seismic research has revealed the complex structure of the crustal volume in the NGR region in two-dimensions (Thurber et al., 1996, 1997), and there has been some work on the three-dimensional (3D) structure at a coarser scale (Lin and Roecker, 1997). In our study we use earthquake body-wave arrival times and differential times (P and S) and explosion arrival times (only P) to image the 3D P- and S-wave velocity structure of the upper crust along the SAF in the NGR using double-difference (DD) tomography. The earthquake and explosion data types have complementary strengths - the earthquake data have good resolution at depth and resolve both Vp and Vs structure, although only where there are sufficient seismic rays between hypocenter and stations, whereas the explosions contribute very good near-surface resolution but for P waves only. The original dataset analyzed by Thurber et al. (1996, 1997) included data from 77 local earthquakes and 8 explosions. We enlarge the dataset with 114 more earthquakes that occurred in the study area, obtain improved S-wave picks using an automated picker, and include absolute and cross-correlation differential times. The inversion code we use is the algorithm tomoDD (Zhang and Thurber, 2003). We assess how the P and S velocity models and earthquake locations vary as we alter the inversion parameters and the inversion grid. The new inversion results show clearly the fine-scale structure of the SAF at depth in 3D, sharpening the image of the velocity contrast from the southwest side to the northeast side.",

            "abstract": "Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) has been a useful tracer of hydrologic flow paths that generate streamflow during hydrologic events. This is due to the distinct strong source of DOC in shallow soil horizons and specific landscape positions within a watershed. The variability in stream DOC concentration was examined in 76 hydrologic events between 1985 and 2014 at Panola Mountain Research Watershed, a small 41-hectare forested watershed near Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.A. Stream DOC concentrations ranged from about 1 to 2 mg/l (as C) in base flow and increased with discharge to a maximum of about 11 mg/l. DOC concentrations in shallow soil water at 15 cm depth varied between about 5 and 25 mg/l and were highest in the summer. Maximum stream event DOC concentrations were lower during winter and spring when conditions are wetter. The timing of the maximum event DOC concentration compared to the stormflow peak was variable. Summer events displayed an almost exclusive counterclockwise (ccw) hysteresis (DOC maximum occurring after the streamflow peak). During other seasons, events exhibited both clockwise (cw) and ccw hysteresis, no hysteresis, and occasionally a figure-8 shaped concentration-discharge response. The hysteretic patterns were compared to various attributes such as precipitation amount and intensity, base flow, streamflow response, and soil moisture antecedent conditions and event response at various soil depths. The ccw response was most related to shallow soil moisture response at a depth of 15 cm that either peaked at or after the hydrograph peak indicating higher contributions of DOC from shallow soils during the storm recession. A cw response was related to a rapid increase in soil moisture that plateaued well before the peak event discharge and occurred when the soil profile was wet. Other DOC response patterns occurred during either intermediate wetness conditions or more varied hydrologic dynamics. Spectral ultraviolet absorption (SUVA), an index of the aromatic fraction of DOC, increased in five high intensity storms during particularly wet antecedent conditions and is likely the result of overland flow, which apparently has a distinct SUVA signature. DOC was a useful tracer indicating the importance of the contribution and timing of shallow flow paths in generating streamflow during hydrologic events.",

            "abstract": "Numerous lakes and seas have been observed in Titan’s polar regions (Stofan et al., 2007), primarily at the north pole (Hayes et al., 2008), while evidence for channelized fluid flow has been found at all latitudes (Lorenz et al., 2008), though primarily at the poles as well. We construct a geomorphologic map of both poles at latitudes higher than 600 using a combination of the Cassini Synthetic Aperture Radar images along with topographic data in the form of SARTopo (Stiles et al., 2009) and sparsely distributed Digital Terrain Models. Utilizing data from flybys Ta through T98, we define five governing morphologic units: plains, small depressions, large seas, mountains and ridge and valley networks. These units are subdivided according to their radar properties (bright or dark, uniformity), morphologies (degree of dissection, undulation, curvature and organization, regional slope), relative elevations and contact relations. These units are systematically mapped in a repeatable, quantitative manner along with various structural features such as remnant ridges, channels, alluvial fans and scarps. In combining SAR imagery with topographic data, our geomorphic map reveals a stratigraphic sequence from which we can infer processes. We find that the North Pole is dominated by an elevated, radar-dark plains unit, embedded by numerous filled, wet and dry small depressions with a sparse number of channels. The dark-plains unit transitions into a highly dissected radar-bright, lowland unit closer to the mare. A high density of radar-dark remnant ridges, channels and alluvial fans characterizes this unit. The South Pole is markedly different from the North, having far fewer lakes, no large filled seas, larger elevation gradients and a greater number of mountain regions while also being dominated by an organized ridge and valley network. Our work suggests the South Pole is not a drier version of the North. Rather the observed dichotomy between the two poles is likely the result of different governing surface process. While fluvial bedrock incision and overland flow processes may dominate the modern South Pole, the North appears to be primarily governed by dissolution and/or sublimation processes along with catastrophic overland flow events at the margins of the elevated, radar-dark plains.",

HRToF-CIMS equipped with a Filter Inlet for Gases and AEROsols (FIGAERO) was utilized to investigate the gas/aerosol partitioning of amines (e.g., methylamine, C2-amines, C3-amines, and C4-amines) under controlled laboratory and ambient conditions. Aerosol samples were collected onto a 25 mm diameter PTFE filter with a pore size of 0.5 μm, followed by thermal desorption (up to 200°C) and analysis by HRToF-CIMS. Aerosol collection and desorption efficiencies were characterized with atomized ammonia and aminium salts. The calibration curve of (CH3NH3)2SO4 was produced over a range of concentrations of interest and showed linear response. During ambient measurement, ammonia was found mostly in the gas phase. However, all amines including their oxidation products (e.g. CH2NH) were mostly in the aerosol phase. The gas/aerosol partitioning of laboratory generated NH4NO3 and (CH3NH3)2SO4 were studied at various RH and were compared with E-AIM model simulations to evaluate the performance of the FIGAERO/HRToF-CIMS.",

            "abstract": "It is accepted that fibrous diamonds grew from the high-density fluids (HDFs) they trapped as microinclusions. Such fluids are not found in monocrystalline (MC) diamonds, leaving their source of carbon a mystery. Fibrous diamonds carry nitrogen in A centers and are young (106 years), while most MC diamonds carry aggregated nitrogen in both A and B centers and are older (109 years). Weiss et al. (2014) found saline HDFs in the core of a coated diamond from Guinea and carbonatitic and saline fluids in a South African diamond, both with low concentrations of B centers (5-27%). Here we report finding microinclusions with high-Mg carbonatitic HDFs in MC diamonds. The infrared spectrum of these diamonds confirms their highly aggregated nature (>60%).\nWe studied a suite of twinned diamonds, macles, from the Venetia mine in South Africa. The diamonds were polished perpendicular to their twinning plane and cleaned in HF and HNO3. We identified the twinning planes in cathodoluminescence images and methodically searched along and next to these planes, assuming that inclusions were preferentially trapped there. Shallow, sub-surface inclusions were analyzed using a JEOL JXA-8230 EPMA and an EDS detector.\nIn two out of 11 diamonds we found inclusions with high concentrations of MgO (26-31 wt%), CaO (21-34%), K2O (9-16%), FeO (7-12%) and SiO2 (8-13%). These compositions are similar to those of HDFs in fibrous diamonds from Guinea and Yakutia (Weiss et al., 2009; Klein-BenDavid et al., 2009; Zedgenizov et al., 2009). Eight carbonatitic inclusions were found in diamond ON-VNT-608 and three in ON-VNT-605.\nFive microinclusions in 608 and one in 605 carry high concentrations of SiO2, MgO and FeO, with little else. Their compositions fall close to that of orthopyroxene, suggesting that both diamonds belong to the peridotitic paragenesis. Other inclusions, rich in SiO2 and Al2O3 in variable proportions were found in 8 of the 11 diamonds. The nature of these inclusions is not yet clear.\nThe presence of high-Mg carbonatitic inclusions in clear, gem-quality diamonds indicates that carbonate-bearing HDFs play a role in the formation of most diamonds. The high aggregation state of the nitrogen affirms a long mantle-residence time implying that the major element composition of diamond-forming fluids has not changed over time.",

            "abstract": "The application of compound-specific radiocarbon dating to molecular biomarkers has allowed for tracking of specific organic carbon pools as they move through the environment, providing insight into complex processes within the global carbon cycle. Here we use this technique to investigate links between glacial-interglacial climate change and terrestrial organic carbon cycling in the catchments of Cariaco Basin and Lake Titicaca, two tropical South American sites with well-characterized climate histories since the last glacial period. By comparing radiocarbon ages of terrestrial biomarkers (leaf wax compounds) with deposition ages in late glacial and Holocene sediments, we are able to gauge the storage time of these compounds in the catchments in soils, floodplains, etc. before transport to marine or lacustrine sediments. We are also able to probe the effects of temperature and hydrologic change individually by taking advantage of opposite hydrologic trends at the two sites: while both were colder during the last glacial period, precipitation at Titicaca decreased from the last glacial period to the Holocene, but the late glacial was marked by drier conditions at Cariaco. Preliminary data from both sites show a wide range of apparent ages of long-chain n-fatty acids (within error of 0 to >10,000 years older than sediment), with the majority showing ages on the order of several millennia at time of deposition and age generally increasing with chain length. While late glacial leaf waxes appear to be older relative to sediment than those deposited in the Holocene at both sites, at Cariaco we find a ~2-3 times larger glacial-interglacial age difference than at Titicaca. We hypothesize that at Titicaca the competing influences of wetter and colder conditions during the last glacial period, which respectively tend to increase and decrease the rate of organic carbon turnover on land, served to minimize the contrast between glacial and interglacial leaf wax storage time compared to Cariaco where temperature and hydrologic change may have acted in concert on the rate of terrestrial carbon turnover. This study has important implications for understanding the effects of large climate change on terrestrial carbon storage, as well as applications of terrestrial biomarkers for paleoclimate records.",

Our experiments consist of exposing aqueous microjets containing SP-B1-25, the natural antioxidant ascorbic acid, and the Fe2+ carried by most atmospheric fine particulates, under mild acidic conditions, such as those created by the innate lung host defense response. Reactants and the products of such interactions are detected via online electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. We will show that ascorbic acid largely inhibits the ozonation of SP-B1-25 in the absence of Fe2+, leading to the formation of an ascorbic acid ozonide (Enami et al., PNAS 2008). In the presence of Fe2+, however, the ozonide decomposes into reactive intermediates that result in the partial oxidation of SP-B1-25, presumable affecting its function as surfactant. We infer that these experimental results establish a plausible causal link for the observed synergic adverse health effects of ambient ozone and fine particulates",

            "abstract": "Since seminal studies of transition zone discontinuities in the 1960ies and the advent of seismic tomography a decade later much progress has been made with the understanding of the scale and nature of mantle convection. First order questions remain, however, about the fluxes between the canonical upper and lower parts of Earth’s mantle and the origin and nature of deep mantle heterogeneity. The first generation of tomographic models depicted fast shear wave propagation in the lowermost mantle beneath the circum-Pacific subduction zones and large low shear wspeed anomalies beneath Africa and the central Pacific. In P-wave models these structures are less apparent, and the anomalous Vp/Vs ratios and related variables are suggestive of chemical heterogeneity. Later tomographic studies revealed the pattern of subducted oceanic lithosphere in more detail and discovered that some slabs sink deep into the lower mantle whereas others remain, at least temporarily, in the transition zone. The complex flow trajectories and the evidence for compositional heterogeneity render simple end-member models of strict layering or unobstructed mantle flow untenable. Various seismic imaging methods have been used to map with increasing precision the variations in depth to the major mantle discontinuities, and also these results are not fully consistent with expectations for simple convection models. In addition, renewed scrutiny with more data and better methods suggest that the models of phase transitions around 410 and 660 km depth in the olivine component of a pyrolitic mantle composition are oversimplifications. Indeed, interfaces are also found at other depths, and many exceptions to the expected anti correlation of the interface topographies have been reported. Some of these observations can be explained with experimental and computational studies of the mineralogy and phase chemistry of deep mantle assemblages, but with such studies still restricted to fairly simple bulk compositions and with seismological probes continuing to discover hitherto unknown complexities, it is clear that the deep mantle still has many secrets to be uncovered and explained. This presentation will be a mix of review of published results and a presentation of preliminary results of seismic tomography and deep earth imaging.",

            "abstract": "The bedload transport of sediment particles is strongly determined by coherent structures of the near bed flow. Many experimental and computational studies have shown this interaction, but the mechanisms that control some important phenomena such as the initiation of particle movement, the probability distribution of resting time and the intermittency in particle transport are not yet fully understood. In order to give new insights into these processes, we carried out simulations over a flat bed channel. We used CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) to solve the 3D Navier-Stokes equations for the flow in a high resolution grid and DEM (Discrete Element Method) to solve the particle dynamics (LIGGGHTS, http://www.cfdem.com/liggghts) using a two-way coupling approach. The objectives are to elucidate i) how the forces determine the intermittency in the sediment transport, and ii) how relevant are collisions between particles during this process. We show that the drag force, generated by the turbulent coherent structures near the bed, is the main driving force in the intermittent jumps of the particles. We conclude that the probability distribution of the resting time of the particles is a key variable that could explain the intermittency in the transport. Therefore, computing the interaction between particles may modify the shape of the probability distribution functions.",

            "abstract": "Chinese Yellow River Station (YRS), at Ny-Alesund, Svalbard is one of the few stations that can make longtime optical auroral observation at the cusp latitude in the dayside during the boreal winter season on the Earth. Since November 2003, an optical observation system consisting of three identical all-sky imagers supplied with the narrow band filters centered at 427.8, 557.5 and 630.0nm, has been installed at YRS, and the continuous observations providing us with an unprecedented opportunity to investigate some new properties of dayside aurora. Optical diffuse auroras are normally observed at the sub-aurora latitude in nightside on the ground. However, by using 7-year continuous observations obtained at YRS, we found that the diffuse auroras are very frequently observed on the dayside at the high latitude, i.e., near the cusp. We classified the dayside diffuse aurora into four primary categories. They are (1) Veiling Diffuse Aurora, which has no obvious morphological structure and clear boundaries, sometimes likes a thick cloud cover the entire sky, (2) Patch Diffuse Aurora, which is an aurora patch normally in ~10-100km in width and usually owns pulsating property; (3) Diffuse Arcs, which looks like an arc but is apparently different from the discrete auroral arcs in morphology, and (4) Pulsating Aurora, occurring with sparkling forms. We statistical studied how the occurrence of the four types of dayside diffuse auroras depends on the local time, magnetic activity, and solar wind conditions. We found that the occurrence of each type of dayside diffuse aurora shows a unimodal distribution with magnetic local time and their peaks are mostly appeared near the magnetic local noon. We also noted that ~92.2% of the dayside diffuse auroras is observed under low magnetic activity, i.e., Kp ≤ 3, and the dayside diffuse auroras prefer to be observed under IMF By<0 and Bz>0. Although previous studies suggested that the dayside diffuse aurora should be caused by wave scattering of relatively high-energy magnetospheric electrons that drift from the nightside after a substorm injection, we believe that our observational results on the dayside diffuse aurora will provide new clues for fully understanding the generation mechanisms to the diffuse aurora.",

Deciphering past climate signals in CG ice cores is particularly challenging due to rapid annual layer thinning and high glaciometeorological noise. As the latest addition to a unique multi-core array, our new ice core (drilled in 2013) is specifically designated for investigation using novel ultra-high resolution techniques in combination with traditional ice core analysis methods. Our novel technique - laser ablation (LA) inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) produced > 8000 samples per meter for this project in comparison with the < 200 samples per meter achievable by the most state of the art continuous flow analysis (CFA) systems.\nHere we present LA calcium (Ca) measurements from our new ice core in comparison with co-registered CFA Ca. This dual approach emphasizes the benefits of increased resolution in the deepest sections while simultaneously demonstrating that both systems capture similar trends in the more shallow sections, including annual layers of greater age than previously established at CG. Additionally, we further examine the composition of selected depth sections, initially found to contain anomalously high Ca, Na, or S, using LA, CFA, and liquid-ICP-MS measurement of discrete acidified meltwater samples. The comprehensive characterization afforded by the combination of all three techniques may enable us to classify the anomalies, quantify their frequency of occurrence and then speculate about the atmospheric conditions connected with such changes.",

            "abstract": "In this study we quantify erosional and depositional processes in the coastal zone (including tidal flats and river channels) of the lower Ganges Brahmaputra delta (GBD). Recent availability of accurately coregistered, radiometrically intercalibrated, Landsat TM, ETM+ & OLI collected since 1988 allows for spatiotemporal (ST) analyses of both natural and anthropogenic processes in the coastal zone on seasonal to interannual time scales. We quantify changes in the coastal zone using 106 cloud-free acquisitions in the area of the 3 Landsat scenes spanning the lower delta. Changes are quantified using multitemporal spectral mixture analysis of exoatmospheric reflectance to represent land cover and water bodies as continuous fields of soil and sediment substrates (S), vegetation (V), and dark surfaces (D; water & shadow). We also use MODIS 16-day EVI composite time series and high spatial resolution (2-4 m) imagery post-2000 to extend and vicariously validate the Landsat-derived observations. Because water levels on the lower delta change by several meters on time scales of hours (tides), months (discharge) and years (relative sea level rise), we use a network of 11 tide gauges to distinguish the effects of these changes in the coastal zone imaged by Landsat. Cross spectral analysis of this network of tide gauge records quantifies the dominant periods and relative magnitudes as well as phase of water level variations across these time scales. Tide gauge records are used to identify Landsat scenes acquired at similar water levels as well as the effects of water level on variations in tidal flats. Water level and water leaving radiance are used to map spatiotemporal variations in suspended sediment. Tri-temporal change maps of SVD fractions show progressive changes of coastlines throughout the study period. We find significant change in tidal flats in acquisitions from different tidal heights, alluding to the importance of tidal phase in coastal analyses. Erosion of forested coastlines is distributed along channels of all sizes, while deposition occurs primarily in more localized regions. Expansion of mangrove forest is observed in several larger areas of deposition. These results suggest that the balance between erosion and deposition is more complex than often assumed in studies of sea level rise on the GBD.",

            "abstract": "Scanning wind lidars offer the possibility to compare full-scale measurements in the wake of a wind turbine with LES wind fields calculated for the same test case. Due to the novelty and the peculiarity of lidar measurements, a comparison between experimental data and simulation results is non-trivial and several methods can be applied. This study presents validation methods for single and dual-doppler lidar measurements respectively.\nConsecutive azimuthal scans - commonly indicated as Plan Position Indicator (PPI) - at a low fixed elevation and centered on the wind turbine wake provide the radial wind speed, i.e. the wind component along the laser beam, on an almost flat polar grid. This data can be directly compared with the radial wind speed evaluated at the measurement point from the simulated wind field. This approach provides a detailed spatial description of the wind field and can be applied to averaged data for steady analysis. For the comparison with LES results, time average and spatial interpolation of the computed wind field are needed. Moreover, a proper wind direction should be chosen to evaluate the radial wind speed.\nWith two lidars performing consecutive PPI scans over the same region from different places it is possible to estimate the horizontal wind field where the scanned regions overlap. Due to the limits in the synchronization of the PPI scans by the lidars, only steady analysis based on time averaged data can be done. A horizontal grid based on the one used for the LES is overlapped to the region covered by the two non-co-planar scans. The horizontal wind field at a considered point can be evaluated solving the system given by at least two non-aligned radial directions about this point. For each node, the data sampled by the lidars in a well defined volume during the considered time interval is used to write this system. Moreover, a discrete approximation of the continuity equation is applied to link the solutions for all the grid nodes. Instead of an interpolation on the LES wind field, this approach requires a temporal and vertical average over the considered time and height intervals.\nThe application of these two approaches to lidar measurements performed in the offshore wind farm »alpha ventus« is presented in this work. The results are going to be used to evaluate different wind turbine wake models applied to LES.",

            "abstract": "Delta inter-channel islands are land masses bounded by channels, resulting from bifurcations and junctions that characterize delta networks. Reflecting the morphology of the channels and the relationship among neighboring channels, delta islands are among the best descriptors of a deltaic network. The islands also play a fundamental role in the propagation of environmental fluxes through the delta and support important ecological processes such as denitrification. Often flooded, delta islands remain inundated for long periods of time suggesting that hydraulic residence time in islands may be longer than in channels, thus allowing for significant denitrification to occur. Which forcings among wind, tides, and discharge contribute to island inundation is a key question.\nIn this work, we apply information theory to identify environmental controls on island inundation in Wax Lake Delta, a naturally prograding delta in coastal Louisiana, USA. We analyze the delta as a “hydrologic web” consisting of connected channels and inter-channel islands to use a network approach and gain insights across spatial and temporal scales. Continuous water level data were collected by sensors placed on five inter-channel islands and a levee for a duration of three months, spanning spring floods and summer flows. Information theory statistics, such as transfer entropy and mutual information, were calculated for all sensors to characterize controls on island inundation in terms of strength, direction, and scale. While high flows (discharge above median) certainly exert significant control on island inundation, wind and tides can cause significant water level set-up and draw-down and control island inundation particularly in the case of low flows (discharge below median). A spatial gradient of inundation response to forcings is observed both at network-scale and at single island-scale. The results quantify the important role played by tides and wind on island inundation in a river-dominated delta. Implications for the transport of sediment and nutrients across the delta network are discussed.",

Furthermore, changes are observed between orbits for the same local time sampling (over tens of days).

            "abstract": "Climate change represents the worst of wicked environmental problems, requiring collaborations among individuals and groups that cross public, private and voluntary sectors on a global scale to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for impacts. The Climate Communication Consortium of Maryland represents such a collaboration on a state level for the purpose of supporting governments, non-profits, businesses and universities in communicating with the public about climate and energy within the context of multiple frames, such as public health, extreme weather, and coastal resilience. The collaboration was developed using communication research as an organizational framework – providing data from yearly public opinion surveys on Marylanders’ attitudes, behaviors and policy support, and a variety of other qualitative and quantitative studies. In this presentation, we will highlight four dimensions of the use of research within collaborative organizational climate communication that can lead to success, or impediments: 1) individual organizational ability and resources for using audience data; 2) the linking of research questions to programmatic development goals and processes; 3) the weighing of audience- versus communicator-oriented values and priorities; and 4) identification of overarching communication objectives that span individual organizational interests. We will illustrate these dimensions using findings from surveys of our member organizations describing the types of barriers organizations face in communicating about climate change effectively, including their use of formative and evaluative research, and will discuss some of the findings from our public opinion and experimental research, illustrating the ways in which these findings influenced programmatic development and were used by Consortium member organizations.",

            "abstract": "Rayleigh wave group velocity dispersion measurements from local and regional earthquakes are used to interpret the lithospheric structure in the Gulf of California region. We compute group velocity maps for Rayleigh waves from 10 to 150 s using earthquakes recorded by broadband stations of the Network of Autonomously Recording Seismographs in Baja California and Mexico mainland, UNM in Mexico, BOR, DPP and GOR in Southern California and TUC in Arizona. The study area is gridded in 120 longitude cells by 180 latitude cells, with an equal spacing of 10 x 10 km. Assuming that each grid point is laterally homogeneous, for each period the tomographic maps are inverted to produce a 3D lithospheric shear wave velocity model for the region.\nNear the Gulf of California rift axis, we found three prominent low shear wave velocity regions, which are associated with mantle upwelling near the Cerro Prieto volcanic field, the Ballenas Transform Fault and the East Pacific Rise. Upwelling of the mantle at lithospheric and asthenospheric depths characterizes most of the Gulf. This more detailed finding is new when compared to previous surface wave studies in the region. A low velocity zone in north-central Baja at ~28ºN which extends east-south-eastward is interpreted as an asthenospheric window. In addition, we also identify a well-defined high velocity zone in the upper mantle beneath central-western Baja California, which correlates with the previously interpreted location of the stalled Guadalupe and Magdalena microplates. We interpret locations of the fossil slab and slab window in light of the distribution of unique post-subduction volcanic rocks in the Gulf of California and Baja California. We also observe a high velocity anomaly at 50 km depth extending down to ~130 km near the southwestern Baja coastline and beneath Baja, which may represent another remnant of the Farallon slab.",

Permafrost is present on 25 % of the northern hemisphere lands and contain high quantities of « frozen » carbon, estimated at 1400 Gt (40 % of the global terrestrial carbon).\nThe aim of this study is to improve our understanding of the climate evolution in arctic areas, and more specifically of land areas covered by snow. The objective is to describe the ground temperature year round including under snow cover, and to analyse the active layer thickness evolution in relation to the climate variability. We use satellite data (fusion of MODIS land surface temperature « LST » and microwave AMSR-E brightness temperature « Tb ») assimilated in the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) of the Canadian climate model coupled with a simple radiative transfer model (HUT). This approach benefits from the advantages of each of the data type in order to complete two objectives : 1- build a solid methodology for retrieving the ground temperature, with and without snow cover, in taïga and tundra areas ; 2 – from those retrieved ground temperatures, derive the summer melt duration and the active layer depth.\nWe describe the coupling of the models and the methodology that adjusts the meteorological input parameters of the CLASS model (mainly air temperature and precipitations derived from the NARR database) in order to minimise the simulated LST and Tb ouputs in comparison with satellite measurements. Using ground-based meteorological data as validation references in NorthEastern Canadian tundra, the results show that the proposed approach improves the soil temperatures estimates when using the MODIS LST and Tb at 10 and 19 GHz to constrain the model in comparison with the model outputs without satellite data. Error analysis is discussed for the summer period (2.5 - 4 K) and for the snow covered winter period (2 – 3.5 K). Further steps are described to apply this methodology over a taiga environment, as we have to take into account the vegetation effects in the radiative transfer.\nA better understanding of the permafrost evolution processes, and particularly the impact of the snow cover should enable us to better apprehend the impact of the global warming on the melt of permafrost and the futur of their carbon stock.",

            "abstract": "NWA 8159 is a olivine-bearing, fine-grained augite basalt from Mars with SNC-like oxygen isotopes and Fe/Mn values. The sample consists of augite, plagioclase (An50-65), olivine (Fa61-76), magnetite and minor orthopyroxene. NWA 8159 has several mm-thick shock-melt veins that have crystallized to a fine-grained granular mixture of silicate and sulfide with a texture unlike that seen in other shocked meteorites. Raman spectra from the veins suggest a Ca-rich garnet in the veins. Although the shock effects in this sample are similar to those of other Martian meteorites, the plagioclase remains anisotropic (crystalline) with polysynthetic twinning and fractures throughout much of the sample. In the vicinity of shock veins, the plagioclase is isotropic and stoichiometric with undisturbed grain boundaries and no fractures. Some plagioclase in contact with shock melt has transformed to tissintite (Ca-jadelite like pyroxene). Fayalitic olivine is partially transformed to ahrensite (spinel) in contact with shock melt. As in several other shocked Martian meteorites, olivine is also transformed into a nanometer-scale mixture of oxide and silicate. Raman spectra from these areas are consistent with the presence of magnetite, rather than magnesiowüstite, as seen in other samples. Minor quartz grains have radiating fractures through the surrounding minerals indicative of partial back transformation from a high-density phase. Raman spectra from this material indicates stishovite and coesite. The coexistence of crystalline plagioclase and maskelynite suggests a moderate shock pressure of 16 – 23 GPa. However, the association of maskelynite and other transformation features with shock veins indicates the importance of high temperatures in creating heterogeneous shock features. Nanometer-scale mineralogy and transformation nano-structures will be investigated in FIB sections with analytical TEM to better constrain the mineralogy, transformation mechanisms and shock conditions.",

Intrinsic predictability tests show that the memory of cloud-resolving-scale organization is not critical for producing desired modes of organized convection such as the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). This has implications for the feasibility of data assimilation and real-world initialization for superparameterized weather forecasting. Climate simulation sensitivity tests demonstrate that 400% acceleration of cloud superparameterization is possible by restricting the 32-128 km scale regime without deteriorating the realism of the simulated MJO but the number of cloud resolving model grid columns is discovered to constrain the efficiency of vertical mixing, with consequences for the simulated liquid cloud climatology.

            "abstract": "Aerosols directly and indirectly affect Earth’s energy balance. The aerosol indirect effect remains the largest uncertainty in global radiative forcing (IPCC, 2013). Various satellite sensors have been employed to estimate aerosol properties globally using multi-channel, multi-angle, polarization and/or Lidar approaches. Sensors able to portray the spatial and temporal dynamics of aerosol loading, such as MODIS and VIIRS, often have low revisiting frequency, i.e. two images per day for the same region. While sensors capable of observing columnar aerosol properties (e.g. CALIPSO, MISR, POLDER) have limited usage for climate study and operational air quality monitoring and forecast because of their narrow swath and sparse revisiting frequency. Imagers onboard Geostationary (GEO) satellite GOES East and West are able to provide half-hourly observations with wide coverage and moderate spatial resolution. However, their use for estimating aerosol optical depth is largely limited because only the visible channel (0.53 – 0.75 μm) can be applied with large uncertainties on spectral properties related to aerosol types. Toward the goal of optimizing aerosol assimilation and forecast in the GEOS-5 systems, we developed a synergistic approach to estimate aerosol optical depth (AOD) over ocean. This algorithm utilizes GOES visible channel observations, look-up tables (LUTs) derived from a coupled ocean-atmosphere radiative transfer model (COART), and is constrained by MODIS-assimilated and GOCART-based GEOS-5 aerosol type information. In this presentation, we describe this algorithm; show the preliminary product, including AOD, aerosol type, and quality assurance; and present validations using AERONET observations and MODIS aerosol product.",

Its activity is characterized by a permanent emission of a gas plume, occasionally interrupted by vulcanian eruptions, and less frequently by sub-plinian eruptions. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of thermal anomaly variations detected in its active crater using Landsat TM and ETM+ images, combined with ground-based measurements, has allowed us to establish an eruptive pattern and relate it to magma circulation. Low intensity eruptions are related to degassing pathways obstruction induced by partial collapse of inner walls of active crater, which produce a decreasing of gas released to atmosphere and consequently an increasing of internal pressure in the magmatic system by volatile accumulation. In this case, low intensity thermal anomalies are detected, with heat flux of 75-765 MW. At critical pressures, energy is liberated as vulcanian eruptions, with columns no higher than 8 km altitude, releasing exclusively non-juvenile products (e.g. July 2000, December 2003 eruptions). After low intensity eruptions, thermal anomalies and heat flux values increase reaching up to 1,005-10,527 MW. On the other hand, high intensity eruptions seems to be related to influx of new and high temperature magma in a cold and more evolved magma chamber, which induce to eruptive processes characterized by emission of columns higher than 15 km altitude and production of pyroclastic flows by column collapse (e.g. April 1993 sub-plinian eruption). Despite previous to high intensity eruptions thermal anomalies and heat flux decrease, during high intensity eruptions heat flux can reach up 867,000 MW, returning subsequently to lower flux values (~10,000 MW).",

Relatively fast structures (5%) are invoked to simulate such observations requiring numerical methods to capture such proportional distortions. Here, we present results from the reverse direction that is the effects on depth phases of deep events propagating up the slab. In particular the Mw6.7 Sea of Okhotsk deep earthquake occurred at a depth of 640 km is believed to be near the bottom of the slab structure and produced an abundance of depth phases. Differential travel time sP-P analysis shows a systematic decrease of up to 5 seconds from Europe to Australia and then to Pacific which is indicative of a dipping high velocity layer above the source region. Multiple simulations using WKM(An upgraded variation of the traditional WKBJ method) and finite difference methods were conducted in an effort to assess the effects of sharp structure on the whole wave-field. Results obtained from analytical methods, by the WKM code become questionable compared against the finite difference method due to its inability to handle the diffraction phases which become crucial in complex structures.\nIn this example, seismicity clustered within a 45 degree dipping benioff zone at shallow depth but became blurred beyond 400 km. Finite difference simulations showed that a slab shapped structure that follows the benioff zone at shallow depth and steepens beyond 400 km produces a model that can account for the sP-P differential travel times of our 5s for oceanic paths.",

            "abstract": "How Saharan mineral dust affects the structure of African easterly waves (AEWs) is an outstanding scientific question. Addressing this question is important because AEWs often serve as precursors to the development of tropical storms off of West Africa. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting Dust (WRFD) model is used to examine the radiative effects of Saharan dust on the structure of AEWs that occurred in July 1995. Two numerical experiments are conducted. The first (control) experiment uses the standard WRF model in the absence of dust. The second experiment is identical to the first, but includes the transport and radiative effects of dust. Dust is modeled by 12 continuity equations for dust-sized particles that represent the spectrum of mineral dust in the atmosphere. Analysis and comparison of the no-dust and dust experiments show that Saharan dust significantly affects the structure of AEWs. For example, a spectral density analysis of the AEWs shows that dust causes higher peak power during the 3 to 6 day period at 700mb. For the meridional wind over Dakar in West Africa, the dust causes the power to increase by about 82% and to shift to a lower frequency by about a half day. Covariance plots show spatial shifts, structural changes and magnitude differences in the AEWs between the dust and no dust experiments. Calculations show that the dust causes the maximum in momentum flux to increase by about 4%. The African easterly jet (AEJ) also shows changes between the dust and no dust experiments. Ongoing work includes quantifying the structural changes of AEWs and the AEJ.",

            "abstract": "Observed “wild” natural fluctuations may differ substantially in their character. Some events may be genuinely\nunforeseen (and unforeseeable), as with Taleb’s “black swans”. These may occur singly, or may have their impact\nfurther magnified by being “bunched” in time. Some of the others may, however, be the rare extreme events from a\nlight-tailed underlying distribution. Studying their occurrence may then be tractable with the methods of extreme\nvalue theory [e.g. Coles, 2001], suitably adapted to allow correlation if that is observed to be present.\nYet others may belong to a third broad class, described in today’s presentation [ reviewed in Watkins, GRL\nFrontiers, 2013, doi: 10.1002/grl.50103]. Such “bursty” time series may show comparatively frequent high\namplitude events, and/or long range correlations between successive values. The frequent large values due to the\nfirst of these effects, modelled in economics by Mandelbrot in 1963 using heavy- tailed probability distributions,\ncan give rise to an “IPCC type I” burst composed of successive wild events. Conversely, long range dependence,\neven in a light-tailed Gaussian model like Mandelbrot and van Ness’ fractional Brownian motion, can integrate\n“mild” events into an extreme “IPCC type III” burst.\nI will show how a standard statistical time series model, linear fractional stable motion (LFSM), which de-\nscends from the two special cases advocated by Mandelbrot, allows these two effects to be varied independently,\nand will present results from a preliminary study of such bursts in LFSM. The consequences for burst scaling when\nlow frequency effects due to dissipation (FARIMA models), and multiplicative cascades (such as multifractals)\nare included will also be discussed, and the physical assumptions and constraints associated with making a given\nchoice of model.",

            "abstract": "Foreknowledge of upcoming events and anniversary dates can be extraordinarily valuable in the planning and preparation of a variety of aviation and Space-related educational programming. Alignment of programming with items “newsworthy” enough to attract media attention on their own can result in effective program promotion at low/no cost. Similarly, awareness and avoidance of dates upon which media and public attention will likely be elsewhere can keep programs from being lost in the noise.\nNASA has created a useful and entertaining app called “SPACE 365” to help supply that foreknowledge. The app contains an extensive database of historical aviation and Space exploration-related events, along with other events and birthdays to provide socio-historical context, as well as an extensive file of present and future space missions, complete with images and videos. The user can search by entry topic category, date, and key words. Upcoming Events allows the user to plan, participate, and engage in significant “don’t miss” happenings.\nThe historical database was originally developed for use at the National Air and Space Museum, then expanded significantly to include more NASA-related information. The CIMA team at NASA MSFC, sponsored by the Planetary Science Division, added NASA current events and NASA educational programming information, and are continually adding new information and improving the functionality and features of the app.\nFeatures of SPACE 365 now include: NASA Image of the Day, Upcoming NASA Events, Event Save, Do Not Miss, and Ask Dr. Steve functions, and the CIMA team recently added a new start page and added improved search and navigation capabilities. App users can now socialize the Images of the Day via Twitter, Pinterest, Facebook, and other social media outlets.\nSPACE 365 is available at no cost from both the Apple appstore and GooglePlay, and has helped NASA, NASM, and other educators plan and schedule programming events. It could help you, too!",

            "abstract": "Smooth pāhoehoe and jagged ʻaʻā represent two end-members of a textural spectrum that reflects the emplacement characteristics of basaltic lava flows. However, many additional textures (e.g., rubbly and slabby pāhoehoe) reflect a range of different process due to lava flow dynamics or interaction with topography. Unfortunately the influence of topography on the distribution of textures in basaltic lava flows is not well-understood. The 18 ± 1.0 ka Twin Craters lava flow in the Zuni-Bandera field (New Mexico, USA) provides an excellent site to study the morphological changes of a lava flow that encountered topographic obstacles. The flow field is 0.2–3.8 km wide with a prominent central tube system that intersects and wraps around a 1000 m long ridge, oriented perpendicular to flow. Upstream of the ridge, the flow has low-relief inflation features extending out and around the ridge. This area includes mildly to heavily disrupted pāhoehoe with interdispersed agglutinated masses, irregularly shaped rubble and lava balls. Breakouts of ʻaʻā and collapse features are also common. These observations suggest crustal disruption due to flow-thickening upstream from the ridge and the movement of lava out and around the obstacle. While the ridge influenced the path of the tube, which wraps around the southern end of the ridge, the series of collapse features and breakouts of ʻaʻā along the tube system are more likely a result of changes in flux throughout the tube system because these features are found both upstream and downstream of the obstacle. This work demonstrates that topography can significantly influence the formation history and surface disruption of a flow field, and in some cases the influence of topography can be separated from the influences of changes in flux along a tube system.",

            "abstract": "On 29th December 2013, the European spacecraft Mars Express performed a very close flyby at the Martian moon Phobos dedicated to the radio science experiment MaRS. The flyby distance was 58 km, the closest ever. Almost 32 hours of continuous tracking data were collected by ESTRACK (35 m) and DSN (70 m) ground station antennas. 31 VLBI antennas worldwide also recorded the radio signal. The tracking data were interrupted by occultations of approximately 1 hour duration in each orbit revolution, when the spacecraft in Mars orbit disappeared behind the planet as seen from the ground station. Images were taken with the Super Resolution Channel (SRC) of the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) onboard Mars Express before and after the flyby in order to improve the ephemeris of Phobos.\nThe gravity field of Phobos was estimated from a close MEX flyby in 2010 at a distance of 77 km. The derived second degree and order gravity coefficients, however, showed large errors and could not resolve the interior structure of Phobos. Hence, the close flyby in 2013 was the opportunity to estimate the gravity field of Phobos at a higher precision because of the closer flyby distance, improved Phobos ephemeris obtained from the HRSC/SRC camera, and longer observation times with the ground station antennas.\nWe aim at measurements of the gravity coefficients C20 and C22, which are linked with the main moments of inertia of the body. By comparison with the Phobos shape model and assuming a homogeneous mass distribution these can help in interpretations of the internal structure of Phobos. The main contribution to the error budget of the gravity field is caused by the uncertainty of the Phobos ephemeris, which potentially can be improved by HRSC/SRC observations.",

            "abstract": "The drainage basin of Totten Glacier (TG) comprises nearly one-eighth of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and contains an estimated ice volume equivalent to 6.9 m of eustatic sea level rise, a value greater than the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Adjacent, and partially covering the area presently corresponding to TG drainage basin, is the Aurora Subglacial Basin, a deep trough that reaches more than 1 km below sea level where geophysical data suggest the existence of numerous subglacial water bodies. Such water bodies maintain zero basal shear stress relatively to the overlying ice. It is theorized that subglacial outburst would decrease the shear stress at the bottom of marine ice sheets near the margin, inducing ice acceleration, thinning and ultimately contributing to the collapse of the ice sheet. In this contribution we present part of the preliminary results of the first geological and geophysical marine survey (NBP1402) to the inner continental shelf off the Sabrina Coast in the Totten Glacier/Moscow University Ice Shelf area, East Antarctica. We describe a set of subglacial features that we interpret as representing the sedimentary and geomorphic record of past subglacial water outbursts. These features, which we refer as “feather moraines”, were imaged by high-resolution multichannel seismic (MCS) and CHIRP data to consist of a stack of subglacial sediments separated by erosional unconformities, and were shown in the swath bathymetry to consist of feather-like areas exhibiting cross and cut relationships between different sets, with distinct step-wise borders on the downstream side. They are superimposed on megascale glacial lineations (MSGL) and are elongated in generally the same direction as the MSGLs. The upstream side of the feather moraines coincides with the initiation of the MSGL and an area of drumlins near the limit of the glacial sediments and the outcropping of bedrock. A network of channels carved in bedrock just south of the feather moraines point in the direction of these geomorphic features suggesting a genetic link. The MCS imaged architecture indicate a constructional origin with progradational facies on the downstream side, and complex array of unconformable surfaces separating different growth stages. Ongoing sedimentary analyses of core samples taken from these features will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The ecosystem services provided by wetlands are widely recognized but difficult to quantify. In particular, estimating the effect of landcover and land use on downstream flood outcomes remains challenging, but is increasingly important in light of climate change predictions of increased precipitation in many areas. Economic valuation can help incorporate ecosystem services into decisions and enable communities to plan for climate and flood resiliency. Here we estimate the economic value of Otter Creek wetlands for Middlebury, VT in mitigating the flood that followed Tropical Storm Irene, as well as for ten historic floods. Observationally, hydrographs above and below the wetlands in the case of each storm indicated the wetlands functioned as a temporary reservoir, slowing the delivery of water to Middlebury. We compare observed floods, based on Middlebury’s hydrograph, with simulated floods for scenarios without wetlands. To simulate these “without wetlands” scenarios, we assume the same volume of water was delivered to Middlebury, but in a shorter time pulse similar to a hydrograph upstream of the wetlands. For scenarios with and without wetlands, we map the spatial extent of flooding using LiDAR digital elevation data. We then estimate flood depth at each affected building, and calculate monetary losses as a function of the flood depth and house value using established depth damage relationships. For example, we expect damages equal to 20% of the houses value for a flood depth of two feet in a two-story home with a basement. We define the value of flood mitigation services as the difference in damages between the with and without wetlands scenario, and find that the Otter Creek wetlands reduced flood damage in Middlebury by 88% following Hurricane Irene. Using the 10 additional historic floods, we estimate an ongoing mean value of $400,000 in avoided damages per year. Economic impacts of this magnitude stress the importance of wetland conservation and warrant the consideration of ecosystem services in land use decisions. Our study indicates that here and elsewhere, green infrastructure may have to potential to increase the resilience of communities to projected changes in climate.",

            "abstract": "Unconventional oil and gas (UOG) production has emerged as an important element in the US and world energy mix. Technological innovations in the oil and gas industry, especially horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, allow for the enhanced release of oil and natural gas from shale compared to conventional oil and gas production. This has made commercial exploitation possible on a large scale.\n Although UOG is enormously successful, there is surprisingly little known about the effects of this technology on the targeted shale formation and on environmental impacts of oil and gas production at the surface. We examined water samples from both conventional and UOG shale wells to determine the composition, source and fate of organic substances present. Extraction of hydrocarbon from shale plays involves the creation and expansion of fractures through the hydraulic fracturing process. This process involves the injection of large volumes of a water-sand mix treated with organic and inorganic chemicals to assist the process and prop open the fractures created. Formation water from a well in the New Albany Shale that was not hydraulically fractured (no injected chemicals) had total organic carbon (TOC) levels that averaged 8 mg/L, and organic substances that included: long-chain fatty acids, alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heterocyclic compounds, alkyl benzenes, and alkyl phenols. In contrast, water from UOG production in the Marcellus Shale had TOC levels as high as 5,500 mg/L, and contained a range of organic chemicals including, solvents, biocides, scale inhibitors, and other organic chemicals at thousands of µg/L for individual compounds. These chemicals and TOC decreased rapidly over the first 20 days of water recovery as injected fluids were recovered, but residual organic compounds (some naturally-occurring) remained up to 250 days after the start of water recovery (TOC 10-30 mg/L). Results show how hydraulic fracturing changes the organic composition of shale formation water, and that some injected organic substances are retained on the shale and slowly released. Thus, appropriate safe disposal of produced water is needed long into production. Changes in organic substances in formation water may impact microbial communities. Current work is focused on UOG production in the Permian Basin, Texas.",

Sumner, NM in late September, 2014. BOPPS will fly an 80-cm telescope with two instruments to detect and characterize two Oort Cloud comets, C/2013 A1 Siding Spring and C/2012 K1 PanSTARRS. The BOPPS instruments [1,2] are the BOPPS Infrared Camera (BIRC), imaging at R band and from 2.5 to 5 microns, and the UVvis camera which includes a fine pointing system to demonstrate sub-arc second pointing and ability to obtain high SNR imaging at wavelengths near 300 nm sensitive to OH emission (1). The BIRC will image the comets in nine filter pass bands at 1.16 arc second per pixel resolution and will measure the strengths of H2O and CO2 emissions at 2.7µ and 4.3µ respectively. These are the primary volatiles driving cometary activity, and there is no alternative way to make these measurements from Earth or from space. The BIRC observations of Comet Siding Spring will occur about three weeks prior to the close approach of the comet to Mars, which will also be observed by the full constellation of Mars spacecraft. We will report initial results of BOPPS comet observations.\n",

            "abstract": "Rice Lake, (40’41” N; 123’30” W, 1109 m elev.) lies in the transition zone of the precipitation dipole in the western United States, which is reflected by the present vegetation – a mosaic of mesic northern mixed hardwood-evergreen forests (Quercus spp., Pinus spp.,  Calocedrus/Juniperus) and more arid southern oak foothill woodlands (Quercus spp.) that borders the westernmost edge of coastal redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) forest. The site, which lies on the active Lake Mountain fault zone, is now a large (~15 ha) sagpond that dries in summer. Between ~26,600 yr - ~15,000 yr, a permanent lake with aquatic vegetation (Isoetes) occupied the core site. Montane conifer forests, with pine (Pinus, spp.), mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), spruce (Picea spp), and western hemlock (T. heterophylla) covered the region. Climatic parameters of modern montane coniferous forest and the continued presence of aquatic vegetation (Isoetes) suggest higher precipitation and lower temperatures during the last glacial. Charcoal (fire event frequency) was minimal. Rapid oscillations of oak, the riparian alder (Alnus), pine, Cupressaceae (Juniperus, Calocedrus), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menzeii), and fir (Abies) characterize the deglacial, and reflect rapid changes in precipitation and temperatures, e.g, Bølling-Allerød warming and Younger Dryas cooling. Between ~15,000 yr and ~13,000 yr, aquatic vegetation of the lake abruptly decreased. Expansion of oak, tanoak (Lithocarpus), shrubs (cf. Ceanothus) and decline of pine and montane conifers, along with the development of marshes with Typha and Cyperaceae on the former lakebed, imply early Holocene warming and decreasing precipitation. This is supported by an increase in charcoal, which is attributed to forest fires. Between ~5,000 yr - ~6,000 yr, a short interval of increased precipitation (inferred from a peak in alder and decrease in Cupressaceae) initiates the development of modern mixed hardwood-evergreen forest. Correlative data from terrestrial and marine climate proxies from a core located 33 km off the mouth of the Eel River, (TN062 0550, 40.9°N, 124.6°W, 569 m water depth) suggest that ENSO-like conditions typified the Holocene.",

            "abstract": "The rapid retreat of many glaciers in the monsoonal Himalaya is of potential societal concern. However, the retreat pattern in the region has been very heterogeneous, likely due in part to the inherent heterogeneity of climate and glaciers within the region. Assessing the impacts of glacier change on water resources, hydroelectric power, and hazard potential requires a detailed understanding of this potentially complex spatial pattern of glacier sensitivity to climate change. Here we quantify glacier surface-mass balance and meltwater flux across the entire glacierized region of the Bhutanese watershed using a full surface-energy and –mass balance model validated with field data. We then test the sensitivity of the glaciers to climatic change and compare the results to a thirty-year record of glacier volume changes. Bhutan is chosen because it (1) sits in the bulls-eye of the monsoon, (2) has >600 glaciers that exhibit the extreme glacier heterogeneity typical of the Himalayas, and (3) faces many of the economic and hazard challenges associated with glacier changes in the Himalaya. Therefore, the methods and results from this study should be broadly applicable to other regions of the monsoonal Himalaya.\nOur modeling results show a complex spatial pattern of glacier sensitivity to changes in climate across the Bhutanese Himalaya. However, our results also show that <15% of the glaciers in Bhutan account for >90% of the total meltwater flux, and that these glaciers are uniformly the glaciers most sensitive to changes in temperature (and less sensitive to other climate variables). We compare these results to a thirty-year record of glacier volume changes over the same region. In particular, we extract DEMs and orthorectified imagery from 1976 historical spy satellite images and 2006 ASTER images. DEM differencing shows that the glaciers that have changed most over the past thirty years also have the highest modeled temperature sensitivity. These results suggest that, despite the complex glacier heterogeneity in the region, the regional meltwater resources are controlled by a very small percentage of the glaciers, and that these glaciers are particularly vulnerable to changes in temperature.",

            "abstract": "The Polaris Project is a unique undergraduate education, research, and outreach initiative that examines global climate change in the Siberian Arctic. The program focuses on permafrost and carbon processes in the boreal and tundra ecosystems of the Kolyma Watershed, the largest watershed underlain by continuous permafrost. Each summer, a diverse group of undergraduate students and faculty mentors spends one month living on the Kolyma River, developing independent projects that engage the students directly in the biogeosciences through authentic scientific research experiences in remote field sites. In all cases the student projects contribute to the overall goal of the Polaris Project to investigate the transport and transformations of carbon and nutrients as they move among terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and the atmosphere. Through the use of online interactive ArcGIS maps the students share their experiences and learning, while posing questions in a format that can be used to engage K-12 learners in the classroom. By embedding information; including databases, photographs and video, informational text, and geospatial data; into user-friendly maps the Polaris Project students will “tell the story” of studying climate change in the Siberian tundra in a way that allows the users to explore climate science through inquiry and web-map based investigation. Through performance expectation topics including Weather and Climate, Interactions, Earth’s Systems, and Human impacts, this investigation uses consideration of the vast amounts of ancient organic matter locked up in permafrost in the region, and concerns about the fate of this ancient organic carbon as temperatures warm and permafrost thaws, to make K-12 climate change connections with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).",

The 2,220 ± 100 BP basaltic eruption in Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve represents early stages of low shield growth, which was aborted when magma supply was cut off. Compared to mature shields, KB is miniscule, with ~0.02 km3 of lava over ~3 km2, yet the ~6 km long series of fissures, cracks and pits are well-preserved for analog studies of volcanic processes. The termination of eruption was likely related to proximity of the 2,270 ± 50 BP eruption of the much larger Wapi lava field (~5.5 km3 over 325 km2 area) on the same rift.\nOur investigation extends early work by R. Greeley and colleagues, focusing on imagery, compositional variations, ejecta distribution, dGPS profiles and LiDAR scans of features related to: (1) fissure eruptions – spatter ramparts, cones, feeder dikes, extension cracks; (2) lava lake formation – surface morphology, squeeze-ups, slab pahoehoe lava mounds, lava drain-back, flow lobe overlaps; and (3) phreatic steam blasts – explosion pits, ejecta blankets of ash and blocks.\nPreliminary results indicate multiple fissure eruptions and growth of a basin-filled lava lake up to ~ 10 m thick with outflow sheet lava flows. Remnant mounds of original lake crust reveal an early high lava lake level, which subsided as much as 5 m as the molten interior drained back into the fissure system. Rapid loss of magma supply led to the collapse of fissure walls allowing groundwater influx that triggered multiple steam blasts along at least 500 m. Early blasts occurred while lake magma pressure was still high enough to produce squeeze-ups when penetrated by ejecta blocks. The King’s Bowl pit crater exemplifies processes of a small, but highly energetic eruption that ejected blocks up to 2 m strewn over 200 m onto the lava lake surface.",

            "abstract": "Gridded precipitation datasets are crucial for driving large-scale models which are related to weather forecast and climate research. However, the quality of precipitation products is usually validated individually. Comparisons between gridded precipitation products along with ground observations provide another avenue for investigating how the precipitation uncertainty would affect the performance of large-scale models. In this study, using data from a set of precipitation gauges over British Columbia and Alberta, we evaluate several widely used North America gridded products including the Canadian Gridded Precipitation Anomalies (CANGRD), the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis, the Water and Global Change (WATCH) project, the thin plate spline smoothing algorithms (ANUSPLIN) and Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA). Based on verification criteria for various temporal and spatial scales, results provide an assessment of possible applications for various precipitation datasets. For long-term climate variation studies (~100 years), CANGRD, NCEP, WATCH and ANUSPLIN have different comparative advantages in terms of their resolution and accuracy. For synoptic and mesoscale precipitation patterns, CaPA provides appealing performance of spatial coherence. In addition to the products comparison, various downscaling methods are also surveyed to explore new verification and bias-reduction methods for improving gridded precipitation outputs for large-scale models.",

            "abstract": "During the last decades, many hydrological models has been created to simulate extreme events or scenarios on catchments. The classical outputs of these models are 2D maps, time series or graphs, which are easily understood by scientists, but not so much by many stakeholders, e.g. mayors or local authorities, and the general public. One goal of the Blue Green Dream project is to create outputs that are adequate for them. To reach this goal, we decided to convert most of the model outputs into a unique 3D visualization interface that combines all of them. This conversion has to be performed with an hydrological thinking to keep the information consistent with the context and the raw outputs.\nWe focus our work on the conversion of the outputs of the Multi-Hydro (MH) model, which is physically based, fully distributed and with a GIS data interface. MH splits the urban water cycle into 4 components: the rainfall, the surface runoff, the infiltration and the drainage. To each of them, corresponds a modeling module with specific inputs and outputs. The superimposition of all this information will highlight the model outputs and help to verify the quality of the raw input data. For example, the spatial and the time variability of the rain generated by the rainfall module will be directly visible in 4D (3D + time) before running a full simulation. It is the same with the runoff module: because the result quality depends of the resolution of the rasterized land use, it will confirm or not the choice of the cell size.\nAs most of the inputs and outputs are GIS files, two main conversions will be applied to display the results into 3D. First, a conversion from vector files to 3D objects. For example, buildings are defined in 2D inside a GIS vector file. Each polygon can be extruded with an height to create volumes. The principle is the same for the roads but an intrusion, instead of an extrusion, is done inside the topography file.\nThe second main conversion is the raster conversion. Several files, such as the topography, the land use, the water depth, etc., are defined by geo-referenced grids. The corresponding grids are converted into a list of triangles to be displayed inside the 3D window. For the water depth, the display in pixels will not longer be the only solution. Creation of water contours will be done to more easily delineate the flood inside the catchment.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen loading has been identified as a potential stressor to marine ecosystems of the Puget Sound in the Pacific Northwest, and the Washington State Department of Ecology has estimated that anthropogenic sources of dissolved inorganic nitrogen to the Sound are 2.7 times higher than natural loads (Mohamedali et al. 2011). The Seattle urban area, situated in the southeast of the Sound, has the largest population in the northwestern US. Heavily urbanized along the coast, the 4 counties comprising the region (Snohomish, King, Pierce, and Kitsap) also include forests and agriculture. Urban and agricultural areas tend to have substantial anthropogenic N loading due to fertilizer application, presence of N-fixing vegetation, N atmospheric deposition, and human and other animal waste. To determine the relative contribution of urban vs. rural agricultural activities to N loads from the Seattle region to the Puget Sound, we used the Net Anthropogenic Nitrogen Inputs (NANI) calculator developed by Hong et al. (2011) for the watersheds of this region. The NANI calculator uses nationally available datasets to calculate NANI as the sum of oxidized N deposition, fertilizer application, agricultural N fixation, net food and feed inputs, and net animal and human N consumption. We found that NANI ranged from approximately 100 to 1500 kg m-2 y-1, with some of the highest rates in watersheds with high impervious surface or agricultural areas with N-fixing crops or large fertilizer additions. Many of the agricultural watersheds have intervening low-NANI watershed between themselves and the coast, thus it is likely that agricultural NANI is attenuated before entering the Puget Sound. The urban areas in the region do not have these attenuating watersheds, and so are likely to be the main contributor to the observed total aquatic N yield. This information is helpful for developing policies to reduce N loading to the Sound.",

            "abstract": "In cultivated fields, residual organic matter is plowed into soil after harvest and decaying in fallow season. Greenhouse gases such as CO2 and CH4 is generated by the decomposition of the substantial organic matter and released into the atmosphere. In some fields, open burning is carried out by tradition, when carbon in residual matter is released into atmosphere as CO2. However, burning effect on carbon budget between crop lands and atmosphere is not entirely considered yet.\nIn this study, coarse organic matter (COM) in paddy soil of a single-crop rice field was sampled on regular intervals between January, 2011 and August, 2014 The amount of carbon release from residual matter was estimated by analyzing of the variations in carbon content of COM. Effects of soil temperature (Ts) and soil water content (SWC) at the paddy field on the rate of carbon decomposition was investigated. Though decreasing rate of COM was much smaller in winter season, it is accelerated at the warming season between April and June every year. Decomposition was resisted for next rice cultivated season despite of highest soil temperature.\nIn addition, the observational field was divided into two areas, and three time open burning experiments were conducted in November, 2011, 2012, and 2013. In each year, three sampling surveys, or plants before harvest and residuals before and after the burning experiment, were done. From these surveys, it is suggested that about 48±2% of carbon contents of above-ground plant was yield out as grain by harvest, and about 27±2% of carbon emitted as CO2 by burning. Carbon content of residuals plowed into soil after the harvest was estimated 293±1 and 220±36gC/m2 in no-burned and burned area, respectively, based on three-years average. It is estimated that 70 and 60% of the first input amount of COM was decomposed after a year in no-burned and burned area, respectively.",

It is bordered by the state of New York on its western side and drains to the north into Quebec, Canada. Lake Champlain is the source of fresh drinking water for over quarter of a million people and provides for the livelihoods and recreational opportunities of many well beyond its borders. The health of this lake is important. During the summermonth’s algae blooms plague the lake. These unsightlygrowths, which affect other aquatic organisms, are the result of excess phosphate flowing into the lake from major tributaries.\nExploring the relationship between soil type and particulate size to phosphate levels in tributaries to the Lake Champlain basin sheds insight on potential sources of phosphate from the Lake Champlain watershed into the lake and may point topossible mitigation efforts.\n Total Phosphate levels and Total Suspended Solids were measured in second and third order streams in the Lake Champlain Basin over a three-year period. These streamsfeed into the Missisquoi River and Winooski Rivers, whichflow into Lake Champlain. Soil was sampled along transects from uplands areas through the riparian corridor to the edge of the streams. These samples were then classified using the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) and an analysis of particle size was conducted.\nIn general there is a correlation between higher levels of phosphate and smaller particulate size.",

            "abstract": "Airborne radar data and a series of numerical simulations are employed to investigate the structure of Hurricane Karl (2010). Karl was a strong hurricane that reached its peak intensity in the Gulf of Mexico before making landfall on the mountainous coast of Veracruz, Mexico. Multiple aircraft extensively sampled Karl during the NASA GRIP campaign, including NASA’s DC-8 aircraft instrumented with the Advanced Precipitation Radar 2 (APR-2). APR-2 is a high-resolution, dual-frequency Doppler radar capable of classifying hydrometeor types. Data from APR-2 provide a unique opportunity to characterize the precipitation and microphysical structure of Hurricane Karl over the open ocean and as it underwent orographic modification during landfall.\nAnalysis of the radar data is complemented by a series of WRF runs, in which different microphysical schemes are employed. In particular, the resulting structures from the simulations are compared to the patterns derived from the APR-2 reflectivity, velocity and hydrometeor snapshots. These comparisons allow for an assessment of the ability of each microphysical scheme to reproduce the observed structure. Consistent with prior studies, it is shown that the vertical and horizontal hydrometeor patterns depend strongly upon the microphysical scheme chosen, despite the relatively similar tracks generated by each model run. Finally, the resulting thermodynamic structures and flow patterns produced by each model simulation are examined to provide information missing from the radar data.",

            "abstract": "Since its introduction by Park, et al. (1999), Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) has become an invaluable geophysical technique for geotechnical site investigation. The technique is primarily focused on developing 2-D and 3-D shear stiffness vs. depth images of the near surface. MASW involves measuring surfaces waves of various frequencies produced by a seismic source, such as a sledgehammer or vibroseis source, which is evaluated to determine the velocity of the shear waves propagating through the subsurface at shallow depths. Traditionally, this technique relies on a long string of geophones as receivers. However, our study utilized a Distributed Acoustic Sensor array to detect ground motion caused by passing surface waves at a spatial resolution of one meter. The purpose of this investigation is to compare the effectiveness of using a DAS array for MASW data collection instead of traditional geophones. Data were collected at the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation’s Garner Valley Downhole Array site (NEES’s GVDA). Various time-frequency filtering and moving window cross correlation (MWCC) techniques were examined for extracting the surface wave dispersion. The results were found to be in good agreement with those previously obtained by Stokoe et al. (2004).",

            "abstract": "Understanding the dynamics and the transport mechanisms of fluidmud is crucial to illuminate the details regarding the attenuation in the surface wave energy over muddy seabed and wave-supported gravity-driven mud flows that take place in nearshore environments. Although there is significant progress through theoretical, experimental, and numerical studies, little attention has been drawn to the intricate alteration in the fluidmud transport over bedforms that inherently exist in the actual field conditions. Specifically, interfacial waves at the fluidmud interface were observed in coastal Louisiana as a part of MURI field experiments in 2010. It is also observed that wave attenuation was dominated by viscous processes during laminar flow and attenuation decreased duing the transition to turbulence. Considering the slow growth of shear instability at the interface, bed forms have a critical role to initiate the growth of interfacial waves and the subsequent transition to turbulence. In this study, we investigate the role of bed forms on the dynamics of moderately thin fluidmud layer via large eddy simulations. Three mud viscosity values, based on the field observations, are tested for a 20 centimeters of mud layer over ripples: (i)ν = 1 x 10-3, (ii) ν = 1 x 10-4 , and (iii) ν = 1 x 10-5 . In Case (i), wave energy dissipation is nearly the same as the one over a flat bed. Case (ii) shows that there is a 10 to 20 percent increase in the wave energy dissipation especially at the fluidmud interface. Finally, in Case (iii), we observe the high-energy transitional flow characteristics. In this presentation, we shall also share the detailed analyses of these simulations.",

            "abstract": "As we peer deeper and in more detail into cratonic lithosphere, intriguing structures arise to peak our curiosity and imagination. Seismic discontinuity imaging reveals anomalous features that appear as depths (~100-160 km) that appear to be shallower than the base of the tomographically inferred cratonic lithosphere (~150-300 km). These are now been known as mid-lithospheric discontinuities (MLD). Magnetotelluric data shows regions of low resistivity suggesting regions of hydration or presence of carbon in graphite form. But how do we interpret these observations and how do we use them to learn more about craton formation and evolution? Some explanations for these anomalies include melt accumulation, the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB), and phase transitions. We propose that many of the structures might actually be related to the initial formation of the cratonic lithosphere. We use a combination of geodynamic models and observations of the depths and orientations of mid-lithospheric seismic discontinuities from a compilation of recent receiver function observations within various regions of cratonic lithosphere around the world and new results from the West African Craton to test whether some of the imaged structure can be attributed to the initial formation of thickened cratonic lithosphere. The formation of thick, cratonic lithosphere should introduce complex structures that could then be preserved within the long-lived regions (to then be later captured by eager geophysicists). We performed numerical simulations of the thickening of lithosphere. We considered two types of thickening - either a process akin to (1) thrust stacking or (2) viscous thickening of the lithospheric material.. In particular, we looked to delineate regions that showed regions with mid-lithospheric discontinuities occurring at variable depths and orientations. Our geodynamic models provide an explanation for the observation that some cratonic regions exhibit mid-lithospheric discontinuities at variable depths and orientations, but others may not.",

SOHO/EIT provides earlier era data, allowing the building EUV coronal hole maps over the course of a solar rotation. We find that for solar cycle 23 the unsigned magnetic flux enclosed by coronal hole boundaries ranges from (2-5)x10^{22} Mx, covering 5%-17% of the solar surface. For solar cycle 24 this flux ranges from (2-4)x10^{22} Mx, covering 5%-10% of the solar surface. Using a surface flux transport model, we compare observational coronal hole boundaries and computed potential open field for solar cycles 23 and 24. From both our observed coronal holes and modeled open magnetic field, we find that low-latitude regions are significant in area, contributing to the total open magnetic flux, and should be considered in more significant detail.",

At the land-ocean interface, river deltas mediate the\nflux of water, sediment, and nutrients from the basin watershed, though the\ncomplex delta river network, and into the coastal ocean. In the Mekong river\ndelta, irrigation networks and surface water storage for rice cultivation\nredistribute, in space and time, water and sediment fluxes along the coastline.\nDistribution of fluxes through the delta is important for accurate assessment of\ndelta land aggregation, coastline migration, and coastal ocean biogeochemistry.\nUsing a basin-scale hydrological model, WBMsed, interfaced with a coastal\nhydrodynamics/wave/sediment model, COAWST, we investigate freshwater and\nsediment plumes and morphological changes to the subaqueous delta front. There\nis considerable uncertainty regarding how the delta spatially filters water and\nsediment fluxes as they transit through the river and irrigation network. By\nadjusting the placement and relative distribution of WBMsed discharge along the\ncoast, we estimate the resulting bounds on sediment plume structure, timing, and\nmorphological deposition patterns. The coastal ocean model is validated by\ncomparing simulated plume structure and seasonality to MERIS and MODIS derived\nestimates of surface turbidity. We find good agreement with regards to plume\nextent and timing, with plumes weakest in the early spring, extending strongly\nto the west in the fall, and toward the east in winter. Uncertainty regarding\nriver outflow distribution along the coastline leads to substantial uncertainty\nin rates of morphological change, particularly away from the main Mekong River\ndistributary channels.",

            "abstract": "During earthquakes, frictional melts can localize on slip surfaces and dramatically weaken faults by melt lubrication. Once seismic slip is arrested, the melt cools and solidifies to form pseudotachylyte (PST), the presence of which is commonly used to infer earthquake slip on ancient exhumed faults. Little is known about the effect of solidified melt on the strength of faults directly preceding a subsequent earthquake. We performed triaxial deformation experiments on cores of tonalite (Gole Larghe fault zone, N. Italy) and mylonite (Alpine fault, New Zealand) in order to assess the strength of PST bearing faults in the lab. Three types of sample were prepared for each rock type; intact, sawcut and PST bearing, and were cored so that the sawcut, PST and foliation planes were orientated at 35° to the length of the core and direction of σ1, i.e., a favorable orientation for reactivation. This choice of samples allowed us to compare the strength of ‘pre-earthquake’ fault (sawcut) to a ‘post-earthquake’ fault with solidified frictional melt, and assess their strength relative to intact samples. Our results show that PST veins effectively weld fault surfaces together, allowing previously faulted rocks to regain cohesive strengths comparable to that of an intact rock. Shearing of the PST is not favored, but subsequent failure and slip is accommodated on new faults nucleating at other zones of weakness. Thus, the mechanism of coseismic weakening by melt lubrication does not necessarily facilitate long-term interseismic deformation localization, at least at the scale of these experiments. In natural fault zones, PSTs are often found distributed over multiple adjacent fault planes or other zones of weakness such as foliation planes. We also modeled the temperature distribution in and around a PST using an approximation for cooling of a thin, infinite sheet by conduction perpendicular to its margins at ambient temperatures commensurate with the depth of PST formation. Results indicate that such PSTs would have cooled below their solidus in tens of seconds, leading to fault welding in under a minute. Cooled solidified melt patches can potentially act as asperities on faults, where faults can cease to be zones of weakness.",

            "abstract": "Silver Lake is the modern terminal playa of the Mojave River. As a result, it is well located to record both influences from the winter precipitation dominated San Bernardino Mountains – the source of the Mojave River – as well as the late-summer to early-fall North American monsoon. Here, we present various physical and geochemical data from a new 8.2 m sediment core taken from Silver Lake, CA that spans modern through 14.8 kcal yrs BP. Age control is based on six bulk organic C radiocarbon dates processed with Bacon v2.2 to generate an age model. Texturally, the core varies between a silty clay and a silty sand, often with abrupt sedimentological transitions. Our working hypothesis states that high percent clay values indicate persistent standing water wherein the deposition, accumulation, and preservation of fine grain sediment exceeds some undefined thickness that inhibits deflation during succeeding desiccation events or ephemeral lake environments. Based on this clay – lake status hypothesis, the sediment core is divided into five lake status intervals. Clay values are highest between 14.4 – 13.5 kcal yrs BP, coeval to Lake Mojave II. Clay values decrease abruptly at 13.5 kcal yrs BP (encapsulating the Younger Dryas) indicating a return to an ephemeral lake. At 11.3 kcal yrs BP, clay values rise abruptly indicating a return to a perennial lake; this early Holocene pluvial ended abruptly at 7.8 kcal yrs BP. From 7.8 – 4.2 kcal yrs BP, clay is low, but variable and mudcracks are common. At 4.2 kcal yrs BP, clay values increase but only moderately indicating a return to more frequent sustained perennial lakes. The early Holocene pluvial is likely a result of higher summer insolation, which generated a more intense and spatially expansive North American monsoon. Coupled with lower winter insolation and thus more winter storms across the region, Silver Lake flourished. A comparison to stable carbon isotope data from Leviathan Cave (NV), support our interpretation as indicated by more productive soils (i.e., wetter) (Lachniet et al., 2014). The resurgence of a wet Mojave ca. 4.2 kcal yrs BP is also supported by the NV cave data. We attribute this late Holocene pluvial to the strengthening of El Niño.",

            "abstract": "Previous radar observations have shown that polar cap flows are highly structured and that localized flow enhancements are related to nightside auroral disturbances. However, such studies are limited to available echo regions. Utilizing wide spatial coverage by an all-sky imager at Resolute Bay and simultaneous SuperDARN radar measurements, we determined properties of such localized flow enhancements and their statistical association with nightside auroral activity. We found that narrow flow enhancements are well collocated with airglow patches with substantially larger velocities (>~200 m/s up to ~700 m/s) than the weak large-scale polar cap convection. The flow widths are similar to the patch widths. During the evolution across nightside the polar cap, the flow directions and speeds are consistent with the patch propagation directions and speeds. These correspondences indicate that patches can visualize localized flow enhancements reflecting the flow width, speed and direction. Such associations were prevalent (~67%) in our survey and tended to be observed under By-dominated IMF. The typical flo\nw channel speed, propagation time, and width within our observation areas were 600 m/s, tens of minutes, and 200-300 km, respectively. Localized flow enhancements were usually observed as a channel elongated in the noon-midnight meridian and directed towards pre-midnight (post-midnight) for +By (-By), and accounted for ~10-40% of the plasma transport across the entire polar cap. Utilizing airglow patches as tracers of localized flow enhancements, we also found that as localized polar cap structures move across the polar cap and impinge on the poleward boundary of the nightside auroral oval, they are followed by poleward boundary intensifications (PBIs), which can extend equatorward as auroral streamers, some of which further propagate equatorward and are followed by a substorm auroral onset. This suggests that localized flow enhancements within the polar cap can contribute to enhanced distant magnetotail reconnection, earthward flow channels in the plasma sheet, and substorm disturbances.",

Daytime HONO concentrations range from low ppt in free troposphere to 10-20 ppt in the boundary layer in the background air masses, to up to 40 ppt in the industrial and urban plumes. While daytime HONO sink is well defined, dominated by its photolysis, daytime sources vary in different types of air masses: pNO3 photolysis appears to be the major HONO source in the background terrestrial air masses in both the boundary layer and the free troposphere. With an average pNO3 photolysis rate constant of (2.8±1.7)×10-4 s-1, p-NO3 photolysis becomes to be an effective pathway to recycle HNO3 to NOx in the troposphere, with HONO as a dominant intermediate product. Within the high-NOx industrial plumes encountered, HONO is predominantly produced by secondary formation processes involving NOx as the precursor. Away from ground surface, no significant nighttime HONO accumulation exists in the background terrestrial air mass.",

            "abstract": "Phyllosilicates that are ubiquitous in subsurface can serve as an iron source for microbial respiration. The objective of this research is to determine the ability of the phyllosilicate Fe to remove nitrate in subsurface undergoing microbial-driven redox cycles. In this study, thus, a well-characterized reference clay (NAu-2; nontronite), was subjected to redox cycles in a system containing dissimilatory Fe(III)-reducing bacteria, Shewanella putrefaciens CN32, and nitrate-dependent Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria, Pseudogulbenkiania sp. Strain 2002. Three redox cycles were conducted in bicarbonate- and PIPES-buffered medium. The extents of Fe(III) reduction, Fe(II) oxidation, nitrate reduction, and its various intermediate products were measured by wet chemical methods. For each cycle, Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy and Mossbauer spectroscopy confirmed Fe oxidation state. Mineralogical changes were identified by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), 57Fe-Mössbauer spectroscopy, and infrared absorption spectroscopy. For all three cycles, nitrate was completely reduced to nitrogen gas under both bicarbonate- and PIPES- buffered conditions. As redox cycle increased, bio-reduction extents of Fe(III) in NAu-2 decreased by 33% and 48% in PIPES- and bicarbonate-buffered medium, respectively; however, bio-oxidation extents increased by 66% and 55% in the same medium, respectively. Despite the change of OH-stretching vibration band and OH-bending vibration bands in NAu-2 structure along Fe redox cycles, XRD data showed interlayer spacing of NAu-2 to be constant along the same Fe redox cycle. 57Fe-Mössbauer spectroscopy indicated complex reduction and re-oxidation pathways. For example, a distinct Fe(II) doublet and a Fe2.5+  feature due to interfacial Fe(II)-Fe(III) electron transfer on clay mineral are prominent in their RT spectra. Both these Fe(II) are partially oxidized by Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria. The result of this study shows that Fe in biogenically reduced or oxidized NAu-2 could serve as a renewable iron source for multiple biogenic redox cycles to remove nitrate contaminant in soils and groundwater systems.",

            "abstract": "Cordilleran Ice Sheet (CIS) delivered meltwater to the NE Pacific Ocean off BC and WA via glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), ice rafting and subglacial meltwater discharge. A deglacial glaciomarine sedimentation record is preserved in the well dated ~50-kyr core MD02-2496 (48˚58.47’ N, 127˚02.14’ W, water depth 1243 m), collected off Vancouver Island. To understand the history of the relationship between the CIS, climate and meltwater discharge, high resolution, multi-proxy geochemical records from the interval that captures the Fraser Glaciation (~30-10 ka) were generated. These proxies include Mg/Ca temperatures and δ18Oseawater from planktonic foraminiferal sp. N. pachyderma and G. bulloides, elemental and organic carbon (Corg) geochemistry of bulk sediments, εNd and K/Ar dating of the <63µm fraction. A detailed reconstruction of CIS retreat has been generated based on the source of glaciomarine sediments and ice rafted debris (IRD), as well as evidence for processes such as GLOF events and iceberg discharge.\nAt the Fraser Glaciation initiation (~30 ka) <63µm glaciomarine sediments deposited at MD02-2496 had a ~100 Ma volcanic rock source. The CIS passed over the Vancouver Island continental shelf at Tofino at ~20 ka ~75 km from the site dramatically increasing sedimentation. From ~19 to 17.3 ka GLOFs created cyclic (~80 year) sedimentary packages of ~300 Ma (εNd of ~-8) shale associated with terrestrial Corg, and ~100 Ma (εNd of ~-3) volcanic sediment associated with marine Corg. The GLOFs were likely to be associated with glacial lake Missoula outburst flooding, occurring during the interval of the coolest ocean temperatures (2-4°C) and most depleted δ18Oseawater (-1.75‰). At 17.3 ka as ocean temperatures increased by ~3°C and δ18Oseawater increased to ~0‰, IRD deposition increased dramatically at the site, terminating abruptly at 16.2 ka. At the Bølling, ocean temperatures rose by > 3°C to 10-12°C in association with an additional IRD event at ~14.8 ka sourced from a ~75 Ma felsic volcanic source, likely the Southern Coast Plutonic Complex. At no point in the δ18Oseawater reconstruction is an obvious meltwater isotopic signature recorded despite the sedimentary evidence for both ice rafting and outburst flooding. Thus CIS meltwater likely entered the NE Pacific Ocean via hyperpycnal flow.",

            "abstract": "Wave-induced recirculation across the sediment-water interface can impact the transport of pollutants through a beach aquifer and their ultimate flux into coastal waters. The fate of nutrients (e.g. from septic and agricultural sources) and fecal indicator bacteria (e.g. E. coil) near the sediment-water interface are of particular concern as these pollutants often lead to degradation of recreational water quality and nearshore ecosystems. This paper presents detailed field measurements of groundwater flows in a freshwater beach aquifer on Lake Huron over periods of intensified wave conditions. Quantifying wave-driven processes in a freshwater beach aquifer enables wave effects to be studied in isolation from density and tidal effects that complicate groundwater flows in marine beaches. Water exchange across the sediment-water interface and groundwater flow patterns were measured using groundwater wells, arrays of vertically nested pressure transducers and manometers. Results show that wave action induces rapid infiltration/exfiltration across the sediment-water interface and a larger recirculation cell through the beach aquifer. Field data is used to validate a numerical groundwater model of wave-induced groundwater flows. While prior studies have simulated the effects of waves on beach groundwater flows, this study is the first attempt to validate these sophisticated modeling approaches. Finally, field data illustrating the impact of wave-induced groundwater flows on nutrient and bacteria fate and transport in beach aquifers will also be presented.",

            "abstract": "During the last years, volcanic activity at Mt. Etna was often characterized by cyclic occurrences of fountains. In the period between January 2011 and June 2013, 38 episodes of lava fountains has been observed. Automatic recognition of the volcano’s states related to lava fountain episodes (Quiet, Pre-Fountaining, Fountaining, Post-Fountaining) is very useful for monitoring purposes. We discovered that such states are strongly related to the trend of RMS (Root Mean Square) of the seismic signal recorded in the summit area.\nIn the framework of the project PON SIGMA (Integrated Cloud-Sensor System for Advanced Multirisk Management) work, we tried to model the system generating its sampled values (assuming to be a Markov process and assuming that RMS time series is a stochastic process), by using Hidden Markov models (HMMs), that are a powerful tool for modeling any time-varying series. HMMs analysis seeks to discover the sequence of hidden states from the observed emissions. In our framework, observed emissions are characters generated by SAX (Symbolic Aggregate approXimation) technique. SAX is able to map RMS time series values with discrete literal emissions. Our experiments showed how to predict volcano states by means of SAX and HMMs.",

            "abstract": "The uncertainty of future water availability due to climate change in the Upper Oldman River Basin in Alberta, Canada, and downstream users is considered in this study. A changing climate can significantly perturb hydrological response within a region, thereby affecting the available water resources within southern Alberta. The ACRU agro-hydrological modelling system is applied to simulate historical (1950-2010) and future (2041-2070) streamflows and volumes of a major irrigation reservoir. Like many highly complex, process-based distributed models, major limitations include the data availability and data quality at finer spatial resolutions. With the use of a scripting language, certain limitations can be greatly reduced. Three phases of the project will be emphasized. First, the assimilation of solar radiation, relative humidity, sunshine hours and wind speed daily data into the Canadian 10KM daily climate data that contains daily precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature data for the period 1950-2010, so as to enable potential evapotranspiration calculations using the Penman-Monteith equation. Second, the downscaling of five regional climate model (RCM) data to match the 10KM spatial resolution was undertaken. Third, a total of 1722 hydrological response units (HRUs) were delineated within the 4403 km2 large upper Oldman River Basin. In all phases of model input data parameterization and calibration, the automation of known external procedures greatly decreased erroneous model inputs and increased the efficiency of validating the quality of input data to be used within the ACRU model.",

            "abstract": "Clumped isotope paleothermometry is based on the association of 13C and 18O within carbonate minerals. Although the influence of temperature on equilibrium 13C–18O bond ordering has been studied, recent oxygen isotope studies of inorganic calcite demonstrate that calcite grown in laboratory experiments and in many natural settings does not form in equilibrium with water. It is therefore likely that the carbon and clumped isotope composition of these calcite crystals are not representative of true thermodynamic equilibrium. To isolate kinetic clumped isotope effects that arise at the mineral-solution interface, clumped isotopic equilibrium of DIC species must be maintained. This can be accomplished by dissolving the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA) into the solution, thereby reducing the time required for isotopic equilibration of DIC species by approximately two orders of magnitude between pH 7.7 and 9.3.\nWe conduct calcite growth experiments aimed specifically at measuring the pH-dependence of kinetic clumped isotope effects during non-equilibrium precipitation of calcite. We precipitated calcite from aqueous solution at a constant pH and controlled supersaturation over the pH range 7.7–9.3 in the presence of CA. For each experiment, a gas mixture of N2 and CO2 is bubbled through a beaker of solution without seed crystals. As CO2 from the gas dissolves into solution, calcite crystals grow on the beaker walls. The pH of the solution is maintained by use of an autotitrator with NaOH as the titrant. We control the temperature, pH, the pCO2 of the gas inflow, and the gas inflow rate, and monitor the total alkalinity, the pCO2 of the gas outflow, and the amount of NaOH added. A constant crystal growth rate of ~1.6 mmol/m2/hr is maintained over all experiments. Results from these experiments are compared to predictions from a recently-developed isotopic ion-by-ion growth model of calcite. The model describes the rate, temperature and pH dependence of oxygen isotope uptake into calcite under non-equilibrium conditions. Adaptation of the model for clumped isotope uptake under non-equilibrium conditions requires knowledge of the clumped isotopic compositions of DIC species and any mass-dependent kinetic fractionation that arises during ion transport to or from the mineral surface.",

            "abstract": "Utilization of slope land in recent years is rapid as a result of the dense population and limit of land resources in Taiwan. Therefore, mountain road plays an essential role for the necessity of human life. However, landslide disaster resulting in road failure occurred frequently in Taiwan on the slope land due to earthquake and typhoon. Previous studies found that the extreme rainfall coupled with the property of fragile geology could cause landslide. Nevertheless, the landslide occurrence might be affected by the drainage of the road side ditches.\nTaiwan Highway No.21 in Chi-Shan watershed and the forest roads located in Xiao-Lin Village, which failure during the hit of Typhoon Morakot in 2009, were selected for exploring the potential of vulnerable to landslides. Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) and Road Curvature (RC) were extracted along the road to indicate the potential sites which are vulnerable to slope failure. The surface runoff diverted by the road side ditches could spoil the sites with high RC due to the straight movement characteristics of the diverted runoff and cause the downslope collapse.\nThe sites with higher mean value and lower standard deviation of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from the SPOT imagery taken in dry and/or rainy seasons could be implied as the vegetation stands showing highly buffer effects in environmental stress due to having deeper soil layer, and are hardly interfered by the drought. The stands located in such sites once collapsed are often resulting in huge volumes of debris. Drainage Density (DD) index could be applied as the degrees of geologic fragile in the slope land. A road across the sites with higher mean value and lower standard deviation of NDVI and/or higher DD should be paid more attention because of having highly vulnerable to deep seated landslide. This study is focusing on extracting and analyzing the environmental indices such as TWI, RC, NDVI and DD for exploring the slope stability along the mountain road.

            "abstract": "The Great Salt Lake (GSL) and Utah Lake (UL) in northern Utah are in the middle of the Intermountain Seismic Belt, a band of active seismicity extending from western Montana through central Utah to northern Arizona. The proximity of these water bodies to an active earthquake zone is ideal for an investigation of lake-triggered seismicity. Both GSL and UL are shallow (10 and 4.3 m, respectively). The fresh water UL drains via the Jordan River into the salty GSL, which has no outlet. GSL has an aerial extent of 4400 km2, and the shallow depth and lack of outlet cause the surface area to change greatly as the lake volume increases and decreases. UL is much smaller with an almost constant aerial extent of 385 km2. For each lake, we compare yearly earthquake counts near the lake to yearly average lake level for years 1975-2013. GSL seismicity and lake level data correlate well, with seismicity increasing 3-5 years after lake level rise (cross correlation coefficient=0.56, P-value=0.0005). There is an especially large increase in seismicity in 1989 NE of the GSL following the historic lake level high stand in the mid-1980s. The 1989 seismicity has characteristics of both a swarm and a traditional mainshock/aftershock sequence. We will use a double-difference method (HypoDD) to relocate these earthquakes. UL seismicity does not correlate well with the lake level. The different results for the two lakes could perhaps be explained by the lakes’ different sizes and the fact that UL has an outlet while GSL does not. The difference might also be explained by subsurface fluid pathways and available faults for nucleating earthquakes. We will further explore the significance of the GSL seismicity and lake level correlation by generating synthetic earthquake catalogs and cross correlating their yearly earthquake counts with the lake level data.",

            "abstract": "Arctic climate has changed rapidly during recent decades, including increased surface temperature, reduced sea ice and land snow, and altered atmospheric circulations. One contributor to this change is absorptive aerosols (black carbon, brown carbon and dust) which are transported to the polar region and darken the bright snow and ice surface. The Arctic aerosol distribution is governed by three factors: emission, transport and deposition processes. Hence, an outstanding question is how will the transport and deposition of these forcing agents change when climate changes. In this study, we use a modified version of Bulk Aerosol Module (BAM) embedded in Community Atmosphere Model version 4 (CAM4) to track aerosol tracers emitted from different locations and investigate their transport to, and deposition within the Arctic in present and future climate. Two experiments have been designed to separate the effects of aerosol transport and deposition. A preliminary result shows that the transport efficiency for aerosols emitted from East Asia will increase about 50% in future climate (end of 21st century under Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5, RCP8.5) compared to present. Further analysis will place this change within the context of shifting atmospheric dynamics in the mid-high latitude region.",

            "abstract": "Here we present a DEM of Greenland covering all ice-free terrain and the margins of the GrIS and local glaciers and ice caps. The DEM is based on the 3534 photos used in the aero-triangulation which were recorded by the Danish Geodata Agency (then the Geodetic Institute) in survey campaigns spanning the period 1978-1987. The GrIS is covered tens of kilometers into the interior due to the large footprints of the photos (30 x 30 km) and control provided by the aero-triangulation. Thus, the data are ideal for providing information for analysis of ice marginal elevation change and also control for satellite-derived DEMs.\nThe results of the validation, error assessments and predicted uncertainties are presented. We test the DEM using Airborne Topographic Mapper (IceBridge ATM) as reference data; evaluate the a posteriori covariance matrix from the aero-triangulation; and co-register DEM blocks of 50 x 50 km to ICESat laser altimetry in order to evaluate the coherency.\nWe complement the aero-photogrammetric DEM with modern laser altimetry and DEMs derived from stereoscopic satellite imagery (AST14DMO) to examine the mass variability of the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream (NEGIS). Our analysis suggests that dynamically-induced mass loss started around 2003 and continued throughout 2014.",

            "abstract": "Following laboratory rock friction experiments, fault strength under sub-seismic slip speeds is thought to depend on a slip rate- and state-dependent friction. Laboratory-measured temperature dependence of the frictional properties and their implied variation with depth form the basis for current models of the seismic cycle. However, scant attention has been paid to the role such heterogeneity has on determining the location and manner in which an earthquake nucleating slip instability develops. Recent work demonstrates that a slip instability on a fault with rate-and-state friction (in which state evolution follows the aging law) occurs as the attraction of a dynamical system towards a fixed point (Viesca, this meeting). Based on this development, we find that the location of that fixed point may be determined if a heterogeneous distribution of the relative rate-weakening parameter a/b is known. (Rate-weakening occurs for 0<a/b<1, and rate-strengthening for a/b>1). That this arises can be deduced considering that (i) the problem that determines the fixed points is equivalent to finding the equilibrium solution for a linearly slip-weakening crack, and (ii) heterogeneities in the parameter a/b have analogy in the equivalent problem to heterogeneities in the background stress. Physically, instability develops where rate-weakening is strongest. We examined the influence such a heterogeneity has on the fixed point attractor (and hence on the instability development) by considering the scenario of a rate-weakening patch embedded within a rate-strengthening region with in-plane or anti-plane slip conditions. Specifically, we solve for fixed points under a rate-weakening heterogeneity within |x|<H of the simple form a(x)/b = (a/b)m + (1-(a/b)m)*|x|/H and rate-strengthening behavior (a/b>1) outside. Additionally, a linear stability analysis reveals the effect of heterogeneity on the stability of the fixed points of the dynamical system. The heterogeneity parameters (a/b)m and H enter as bifurcation parameters indicating a transition in the classification of the fixed point from asymptotically stable to unstable at critical values of (a/b)m and H. The results are further verified by full numerical simulation of the system of slip acceleration and state evolution under this heterogeneity.",

However, they are required in order to characterize and understand possible ice-ocean interactions involving the eastern sector of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS). We have generated a high-resolution stable isotope and detrital stratigraphic record for core HU2001043-008 (990m, 48° N, 45° W) from Flemish Pass, Labrador Sea, to better understand the role of LIS ice-rafting events in abrupt climate changes during the last glaciation. Samples at two-centimeter resolution were disaggregated, washed, and picked for Neogloboquandrina pachyderma (sinistral) for stable isotope and radiocarbon analysis. The δ18O signal in foraminiferal calcite allows us to examine surface-ocean changes that may indicate an influx of freshwater, which may or may not be related to an LIS ice-rafting event. Our results will help in developing a better understanding of the source of LIS ice-rafting events, precursory indicators of the events, and how these events are associated with changes in deep-water formation in the Labrador Sea.",

            "abstract": "Accurate precipitation and temperature forecasts are the pre-requisites to produce skillful flood forecasts. The structures of different precipitation forecasting systems are constantly evolving, for example, with improvements in the forecasting techniques, increases in spatial and temporal resolution, improvements in model physics and numerical techniques, and better understanding of uncertainty. Hence, routine verification is necessary to understand the quality of forecasts at particular times and locations, and as inputs to hydrologic modeling. Hydrologic forecasters in the National Weather Service are evaluating precipitation and temperature forecasts from a wide range of numerical prediction models to improve the streamflow forecasts. To assist in this effort, our goal here is to verify the operational precipitation forecasts from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction 21-member Short Range Ensemble Forecast (SREF) system, together with precipitation reforecasts from the 11-member Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS). The verification is done for the middle- and north-eastern region of the United States and for mean areal precipitation forecasts conditioned on precipitation amounts, lead times, seasonality, and accumulation periods. Multi-sensor precipitation estimates are used as observed data. The effect of different basin sizes on forecast quality is also studied by simply choosing areal extents of varying sizes. Although flood forecasting is the main context of this study, separate analyses are presented for moderate and large precipitation events with a view towards providing additional information to forecasters. The summary of verification statistics indicates similar forecasting performance for both SREF and GEFS reforecasts even though GEFS reforecasts are valid for much longer lead times and coarser grid resolution. Precipitation forecasts from both of these models show greater skill in large basins than in relatively smaller ones. Lastly, we identify and highlight the potential of the verified precipitation forecasts as forcing inputs to hydrologic modeling.",

            "abstract": "The Monsoon Intraseasonal Oscillation (MISO) and the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) are two of the dominant elements of the tropical atmosphere exhibiting strong intraseasonal variability (ISV). They are the main components of the tropical intraseasonal oscillation (TISO). Both these events are important because of the extent of their respective influences geographically, materially in demography and economics and temporally as their subseasonality connects weather forecasts to climate predictions. This study investigates whether these principal intraseasonal oscillations (ISO) are same or different over the Indo-Pacific tropical region by using mechanistic experiments run on an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM), CAM4.0. We try to better understand the eastward propagation common to both MISO and MJO, through a few idealized experiments and experiments where observational signals are applied. In the idealized experiments a very narrow band of idealized eastward propagating heating and cooling signal is applied to the temperature tendency of CAM4.0 over the Indo-Pacific equatorial belt. In the observational experiments, observed diabatic heating MISO and MJO signals are added to CAM4.0, again over the Indo-Pacific region. These experiments are run during boreal summer (JJAS) and boreal winter (DJFM) separately. The response of temperature tendency meridionally will be discussed. The response and changes both zonally and meridionally in circulation, specific humidity and diabatic heating of the model will also be presented.",

            "abstract": "The central Appalachian basin (CAB) in the eastern United States contains complicated sedimentary sequences often with thin and discontinuous strata. As an economically important coal-producing region, the basin’s architectural framework and depositional history are important to understand. Typically, eustatic marine incursions, marked with black shale deposits, are used for basin-wide correlation. The Betsie Shale Member of the Kanawha Formation represents one of these relatively thick and laterally extensive marine zones. This study examines the palynoflora of the Matewan coalbed, which conformably underlies the Betsie, in the context of a new Re-Os date for the Betsie Shale Member and additional geochemical measures. At its base, the Matewan contains abundant lycopsid tree spores, indicative of a submerged, flooded paleomire. Upsection, biodiversity increases to include small fern and calamite spores as well as cordaite pollen. Combined with an observed increase of inertinite, the diversification of palynoflora suggests surficial peat exposure and drying out of the paleomire. A S-rich (28 wt. %) shaley parting separates these lower and upper benches of the Matewan and may represent an initial marine pulse prior to the glacioeustatic incursion that ultimately flooded the Matewan and deposited the overlying Betsie Shale. The Betsie is organic-rich (3.05 – 4.89 wt. % TOC) with Re and Os content ranging from 320 – 1,200 ppb and 1.5 – 5.3 ppb, respectively. The highly enriched Re values result in notably high parent:daughter ratios (187Re/188Os = 3,644 – 5,737). The Re-Os isotopic data yield a Model 1 age of 323 ± 7.8 Ma (n = 7; MSWD = 0.63) with evidence that the true age lies closer to the younger end of the uncertainty. This age is consistent with previous paleontologic-based interpretations but represents the first directly measured radiometric date for the Betsie. An absolute age for the Betsie is a critical result, as the member is correlated with units in Wales and Germany and therefore has implications across the Carboniferous Euramerican Belt. Further, the Betsie has been interpreted to represent the Lower-Middle Pennsylvanian stage boundary in North America, making this directly measured age an important marker not only within the CAB but also for refinement of the Carboniferous timescale.",

            "abstract": "The Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) began taking Along-Track Oversampled (ATO) observations in 2010 to obtain super-resolution hyperspectral images, with spatial resolutions in the along-track direction of as small as ~5 m/pixel. We present a new method to both process and reduce noise in the ATOs. We developed a log-likelihood algorithm to determine the most likely estimate of the actual Martian surface given the CRISM spectral radiance measurements and spatial and spectral transfer functions (TF). We assume the spatial TF is given by a 2D Gaussian and use the asymmetric Gaussian spectral TF given in the CRISM documentation. The log-likelihood method reduces Poisson noise in the spectrum for a given hyperspectral pixel, allowing for identification of subtle spectral absorptions otherwise lost in noise. We assume that the data are Poisson distributed and that the mean μ is given by a blurred version of the actual scene c. The CRISM ATO is this blurred version. It is more efficient to maximize the log of a function rather than the function itself, so we compute the image c that maximizes the log-likelihood function for the data. We begin with an initial guess for the projected, estimated scene c and have the freedom to choose any reasonable output pixel size. To forward project, we convolve the spatial TF with c and then convolve the spectral TF with the output. The result is a simulation of the measured ATO. We divide the CRISM ATO by this simulated scene to obtain the error, and then we backproject the error into dimensions of c by applying transposes of the TFs. Finally, we update our guess for the actual scene by multiplying c by the backprojected error. We iterate until convergence. We focus our analysis on recent ATOs of Gale Crater to illustrate the advantages of the method. We will also present a combined Poisson and Gaussian noise iterative approach with regularization and results for reducing noise in CRISM data.",

During the science operational phase (since April, 2014), the three spacecraft were placed in slightly different polar orbits: one spacecraft in a higher altitude orbit (507km x 512km) and two side-by-side in lower altitude orbits (459km x 462km).

            "abstract": "Changes in atmospheric cooling due to enhanced divergence of radiative fluxes are well accepted to explain the long-term changes in global precipitation coming along with global warming. Recent studies have shown that the rate of change of global annual mean precipitation in 21st century climate scenarios are well correlated with changes in clear-sky radiative divergence for both CMIP3 and CMIP5 multi-model ensembles.\nThe shortwave component of the clear-sky radiative cooling has been found to explain both the rates of change in rainfall and the wide diversity between models in most future climate scenarios. But there is low agreement on the reasons for the inter model spread in clear-sky shortwave radiative divergence. In particular, it has not been shown if this inter-model range primarily results from differences in the characteristics of water vapor or in the parameterization of shortwave absorption in radiative transfer codes.\nIn the present study we examine the reasons for the large diversity in clear-sky shortwave radiative divergence and their implications for global-mean precipitation, using the models assembled for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project and assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We quantify the contributions of the parameterization of shortwave absorption, of changes in the concentration and spatial distribution of water vapor and of the short- and long-lived anthropogenic forcing agents to the inter-model range in shortwave radiative cooling. We conclude by discussing the need to reduce the spread in radiative physics, anthropogenic shortwave diabatic heating, and background state, especially water vapor, across the next generation of multi-model ensembles used to project future precipitation.",

            "abstract": "Iceberg calving is a major process involved in the removal of large volumes of ice from ice sheets to the oceans, but remains relatively poorly understood. The part of the puzzle that remains the least clear is the dynamics involved in the transition between intact glacier ice and rapid fragmentation during calving events. Because calving is a sudden rapid event, it is often the case that what gets captured by satellite observation is the before and after, rather than the exact moment of failure. Here we exploit this fact and use a statistical approach using a collapse model to investigate whether or not there exists a quantifiable critical fracture density, or \"critical mass\" of closely-spaced fractures, beyond which dynamic fragmentation of the glacier occurs. To do this we study the size distribution of fragments in proglacial mélange, using this information to infer physical properties of the pre-collapsed ice, such as material strength and the energy necessary to create a fragmentation event using methods widely applied in civil and even weapons engineering, but not previously applied in a glaciological context. Characterizing fracture density at different locations and quantifying a critical factor to describe the transition from highly-fractured to collapse/fragmentation region enable us to understand the distribution of observable surface fracture patterns and underlying differences within regions of individual glaciers and between glaciers. This investigation is well-served by the only-recently-available high resolution data over Greenland’s glaciers by LandSat, MODIS and Operation IceBridge, among others. While many studies have focused on the propagation of crevasses in the glacier ice as a means of predicting calving, the main goal of this work is to consider the physical transition between the two phases of collapse. As such, our work focuses (1) on the pre-collapse state as characterized by crevasse pattern formation in the glacier, or level of damage present; and (2) on the post-collapse state as characterized by proglacial mélange properties. Application of these techniques to glaciers yield insight into the processes leading up to collapse and enable us to determine critical parameters such as critical fracture density, antecedent to collapse events.",

            "abstract": "Modeling the dynamics of chemical transport from the landscape to streams is necessary for water quality management. Previous work has shown that estimates of the distribution of water age in streams, the transit time distribution (TTD), can improve prediction of the concentration of conservative tracers (i.e., ones that “follow the water”) based on upstream watershed inputs. A major challenge however has been accounting for climate and transport variability when estimating TDDs at the catchment scale. In this regard, Harman (2014, in review) proposed the Omega modeling framework capable of using watershed hydraulic fluxes to approximate the time-varying TTD. The approach was previously applied to the Plynlimon research watershed in Wales to simulate stream concentration dynamics of a conservative tracer (chloride) including 1/f attenuation of the power spectra density. In this study we explore the extent to which TTDs estimated by the Omega model vary with the concentration of non-conservative tracers (i.e., ones whose concentrations are also affected by transformations and interactions with other phases). First we test the hypothesis that the TTD calibrated in Plynlimon can explain a large part of the variation in non-conservative stream water constituents associated with storm flow (acidity, Al, DOC, Fe) and base flow (Ca, Si). While controlling for discharge, we show a correlation between the percentage of water of different ages and constituent concentration. Second, we test the hypothesis that TTDs help explain variation in stream nitrate concentration, which is of particular interest for pollution control but can be highly non-conservative. We compare simulation runs from Plynlimon and the agricultural Choptank watershed in Maryland, USA. Following a top-down approach, we estimate nitrate concentration as if it were a conservative tracer and examine the structure of residuals at different temporal resolutions. Finally, we consider model modifications to account for the effects of nitrogenous biogeochemical transformations.",

The Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM) is one of the few models in the world that requires remote sensing derived snow cover as model input. Based on the SRM hydrological model, this study simulated the snowmelt process in melt-season of 2007 in Manasi River Basin and try to make contribution to the understanding of snowmelt runoff process in such ungagged catchment. The conclusions are as follows: the SRM model represented a certain semi-distributed model with physical mechanism, has a good applicability in scarcely meteorological and hydrological suits distributed catchments. The correlation coefficient between computed runoff and measured runoff could reach 0.93 with 2.57% volume derivation in ideal situation without the effects of instantaneous precipitation during March-Jun, 2007. As one of the most important input variables, the daily snow cover extent derived from MOD10A1 are effectively make up the lack of in suit snow observations. The classification accuracy of MOD10A1 reached 0.81 in 95% confidence level on 3×3 pixels statistical scale verified by the Landsat 5 TM images. Meanwhile, temperature and precipitation played important roles on snowmelt runoff simulation, the correlation coefficient between daily temperature and daily measured runoff is 0.46 in 95% confidence level. The lase rate of discharge determined the basic shape of computed runoff, while the precipitation and lag time inputs determined the peak size and peak position of computed runoff. There are also issues unsolved in this study, the threshold value of NDSI used in the MOD10A1 need to be further testified in the arid region, the effects of instantaneous precipitation on snowmelt runoff simulation also need to be further discussed.",

            "abstract": "Flash flooding is a concern in watersheds of the New York City Water Supply System, as the turbidity associated with rapid flooding is unacceptable in an unfiltered water supply. Previous studies suggest that flash flooding will occur more frequently in this region in a changing climate. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the conditions associated with flash flooding are important for effective watershed management. Seven flash floods were identified in the hydrologic record for the Neversink River near Claryville, NY from 1 April 1987 through 15 July 2014. Case studies using Weather Prediction Center forecast maps, National Centers for Environmental Prediction/ National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis daily composites, and co-operative station data were used to characterize each event. Forecast maps indicate synoptic-scale frontal activity concurrent with all flash flood events. The four winter flash flood peaks are associated with rain on existing snowpack, with anomalously warm 1000 mb temperatures and anomalously high precipitation rates. The three summer flash flood peaks are associated with convective activity, high precipitation rates, anomalously warm 1000 mb temperatures, and southerly winds. NCEP/NCAR climate composites for winter and summer flash flood events are consistent with the case studies presented. The frequency of these broad-scale conditions suggest that localized effects of the basin conditions separate flash flood events from other high discharge events. Recognizing these conditions in the context of climate predictions is useful for effective and proactive water management in the region to maintain an unfiltered water supply for the greater New York City area.",

            "abstract": "The Palgongsan Granite which intruded into the Cretaceous Gyengsang Basin in SE Korea is elongated in NW-SE direction (ca. 2.4 aspect ratio of long axis to short in exposure) and is generally thought as being emplaced along the WNW-ESE trending Palgongsan Fault which is the boundary between the Uiseong sub-basin (north) and Miryang sub-basin (south) within the basin.\nIt is widely believed that emplacement of the pluton along the sub-basin boundary removed all evidence associated with the faulting. Recent studies of gravity and aeromagnetic anomalies in the vicinity of the granite imply that the emplacement of this pluton was controlled by the geometry of WNW-ESE trending right-lateral overstepping lineaments. It gives us an opportunity to examine the controlling factors for emplacement such as the internal structural characteristics of the pluton, thermal cooling history, residual magmatic fluid pressure, and external regional stress regime.\nWithin the granite, pegmatitic dykes and hydrothermal deposits related to the late stages of intrusion are frequently observed and penetrative joints and faults are also well developed. The study of orientation, distribution, relative cross-cutting relationships and kinematics based on the indicators of each structural element coupled with geochronological and geophysical data provides information of the prevailing stress regime at the time of dyke intrusions and the controlling structures, such as strike-slip overstepping and dilational linkage. The results of 3-D mohr-circle analysis for NW-SE trending dykes show they intruded under vertical σ1 and NE-SW horizontal σ3 in low differential stress and relatively high residual pressure of magmatic fluid. This coincided with regional NW-SE horizontal σ1 and NE-SW horizontal σ3 direction based on other structural analysis.\nAlthough these results imply the possibility that the pluton was emplaced in a dilational overstep along a WNW-ESE reactivated dextral strike-slip fault, felsic intrusions in the upper crust are not only controlled by pre-existing structures but are also controlled by other factors such as magmatic flow behavior. Therefore further studies such as magnetic anisotropy suspension and seismic exploration are required to fully understand the mode of emplacement of the Palgongsan Granite.",

            "abstract": "Measuring urban change is important for policy makers at the municipal, regional, national, and international levels. However, obtaining urban metrics from countries is often difficult, and data-poor, developing countries have little to no capacity to measure urban change over long time periods. The goals of this analysis were to develop a standard methodology for extracting urban footprints from remotely sensed data, and to determine what environmental and economic conditions control urban brightness. For example, an urban area in a country with less development may have darker urban areas than their more developed counterparts, thus, country specific thresholds for separating urban from non-urban areas are necessary to appropriately analyze urbanization. Nighttime lights data, from the DMSP-OLS constellation, are well suited for this task, due to their global coverage, historical archive, and ease of accessibility for data-poor countries. In this project, we used ESA’s GlobCover dataset as our validation data, and developed a country-specific classification of urban vs. non urban cover using the nighttime lights data. Classification accuracies varied by country, but ranged from ~90-99%. Preliminary results show that brightness thresholds vary substantially both between countries, and as a function of geographic location. Finally, brightness thresholds and their associated accuracies were compared to environmental and economic indices through regression analysis, in an attempt to determine the drivers of urban brightness.",

            "abstract": "One of the recurring challenges of creating earth science data records is to ensure a consistent level of metadata compliance at the granule level where important details of contents, provenance, producer, and data references are necessary to obtain a sufficient level of understanding. These details are important not just for individual data consumers but also for autonomous software systems. Two of the most popular metadata standards at the granule level are the Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions and the Attribute Conventions for Dataset Discovery (ACDD). Many data producers have implemented one or both of these models including the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) for their global SST products and the Ocean Biology Processing Group for NASA ocean color and SST products. While both the CF and ACDD models contain various level of metadata richness, the actual “required” attributes are quite small in number. Metadata at the granule level becomes much more useful when recommended or optional attributes are implemented that document spatial and temporal ranges, lineage and provenance, sources, keywords, and references etc. In this presentation we report on a new open source tool to check the compliance of netCDF and HDF5 granules to the CF and ACCD metadata models. The tool, written in Python, was originally implemented to support metadata compliance for netCDF records as part of the NOAA’s Integrated Ocean Observing System. It outputs standardized scoring for metadata compliance for both CF and ACDD, produces an objective summary weight, and can be implemented for remote records via OPeNDAP calls. Originally a command-line tool, we have extended it to provide a user-friendly web interface. Reports on metadata testing are grouped in hierarchies that make it easier to track flaws and inconsistencies in the record. We have also extended it to support explicit metadata structures and semantic syntax for the GHRSST project that can be easily adapted to other satellite missions as well. Overall, we hope this tool will provide the community with a useful mechanism to improve metadata quality and consistency at the granule level by providing objective scoring and assessment, as well as encourage data producers to improve metadata quality and quantity.",

As a significant component of atmospheric carbon exchange, above-ground biomass in forests remains a large source of uncertainty in current climate models. To address the need for forest structure monitoring on a global scale we propose an algorithm for estimating ground elevation, canopy height, and canopy cover from the forthcoming NASA earth-observing satellite, ICESat-2, planned for launch in 2017. The payload, a next-generation micro-pulse photon-counting LiDAR sensor known as the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), is primarily designed for monitoring ice-masses. Thus several significant challenges need to be overcome to generate canopy measurements. This work presents a Bayesian state-space generative statistical model to estimate canopy height and cover accurately from the low signal-to-noise data expected from ATLAS, and demonstrates the effectiveness with data simulations. The method performs comparably to existing methods with several advantages including robustness to noise, extensibility, and ease of data fusion.",

            "abstract": "Oil and gas production in the Western United States has increased considerably over the past 10 years. While many of the still limited oil and gas impact assessments have focused on potential human health impacts, the typically remote locations of production in the Intermountain West suggests that the impacts of oil and gas production on national parks and wilderness areas (class 1&2 areas) could also be important. To evaluate this, we utilize the Comprehensive Air quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) with two year-long modeling episodes representing 2008 and 2011, meteorology and emissions. The model inputs for the 2008 and 2011 episodes were generated as part of the West-wide Jump-start Air Quality Modeling Study (WestJumpAQMS) and Three State Air Quality Study (3SAQS) respectively. Both studies included a detailed assessment of oil and gas (O&G) emissions in Western States for the respective years. Each year-long modeling episode was run both with and without emissions from O&G production. The difference between these two runs provides an estimate of the contribution of the O&G production to air quality. These data were used to assess the contribution of O&G to the 8 hour average ozone concentrations, daily and annual fine particulate concentrations, annual nitrogen deposition totals and visibility in the modeling domain. We present the results for the class 1&2 areas in the Western US. We also present temporal trends of O&G impacts, differentiating between trends in urban and rural areas.",

            "abstract": "We analyze a 22 years of shale gas production, from more than 18,000 wells, in the Barnett formation to better characterize and understand shale gas production. The Barnett Shale formation has a relatively long history of exploration and shale gas production using both hydraulic fracturing and horizontal wells. The original Barnett well, a vertical well that used a nitrogen foam working fluid, dates back to 1981, and the first horizontal wells were drilled in 1991. However, the first “successful” production wells were not drilled until around 1997-1998.\nGas production data for the Barnett is publicly available dating back to 1993. Here, we analyze gas production from ~18,000 individual wells (data collected in July 2014) in order to understand and quantify how shale gas has been produced in the Barnett. This includes understanding how and when shale gas production techniques have improved resulting in enhanced gas production. Several key trends and hypotheses emerge from this analysis. For example, the data shows a distinct and strong pattern of “learning by doing”, whereby per-well gas production rates have notably increased over time. For example, a typical well drilled in 2011 takes three years to produce 1,000 MMcf, whereas a typical 2007 well takes seven years to produce the same quantity. The data can also be differentiated by parameters such as depth and well type (principally vertical vs. horizontal); we show a clear link between drilling techniques and production. The analysis also reveals unexpected outcomes. For instance, wells drilled in the period 1994-1999 have greater cumulative production than wells drilled in the period 2000-2006. We hypothesize that the older wells often performed poorly when first drilled and were thus subsequently re-fractured one or more times, whereas the later wells were re-fractured much less frequently.\nFinally, we compare shale gas production from the Barnett formation with more recent production from the Hayneville-Bossier and Eagle Ford formations. We believe that lessons learned from historic shale gas production can help us better understand shale production, including quantifying “rates of learning”, as well as providing the foundation of understanding the benefits and challenges of alternative working fluids such as CO2.",

            "abstract": "The COSIMA time of flight mass spectrometer on board the ROSETTA spacecraft (Kissel et al., 2007, 2009) will provide the first in-situ high resolution spectra of cometary grains. The first results on mass spectra will be presented in companion abstracts (e.g. Hilchenbach et al.). The grains are collected by three 10 mm x 10 mm targets exposed simultaneously in front of a funnel. The first exposed targets are covered by a very smooth “metal black” layer (gold and silver). Given the relatively low dust flux expected during the first stages of the RV phase and the non-renewable supply of Indium in the ion source, identifying the best candidate collected grains is a critical issue. For this purpose, COSIMA images the targets by presenting them before and after exposure in front of a camera (“COSISCOPE”), with grazing incidence illumination from opposite directions by two LED’s. The images will also provide information on the scattering properties of the collected grains. The resolution of the camera is 14 µm / pixel, which makes it possible to identify features filling up a significant fraction of the analyzed spot (50 µm FWHM).\n The images of the first targets before and after exposure are downloaded without compression and with sub-pixel sampling for providing maximum resolution. Several algorithms have been developed so as to provide a priority ranking of features to be analyzed by SIMS. The results of this process will be presented, as well as the relationship between the optical signatures of high priority features and the outcome of the SIMS analyses.\n ",

            "abstract": "The Indian Summer Monsoon directly affects the lives of over 1/6th of the world’s population, being critical for agriculture (>50% of the agricultural lands are still rainfed) and water availability in the subcontinent. The summer monsoon is characterized by a dominant 30-60 day mode of intraseasonal variability causing the occurrence of wet and dry spells over a substantial portion of India during the peak-monsoon months (July-August). We use a 1°x1° gridded rainfall dataset (1951-2011) from the Indian Meteorological Department to quantify changes in the mean and intraseasonal variability of daily summer monsoon rainfall across India. Using a non-parametric statistical methodology to account for temporal correlation in the time-series, we find a statistically significant decreasing trend in rainfall and increasing trend in variability in many regions, and changes in the characteristics of wet and dry spells.Using geopotential heights from the NCEP reanalysis dataset, we apply the Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) approach (cluster analysis) to define typical upper (200mb) and lower-level (850mb) atmospheric patterns associated with extreme wet and dry conditions in the different sub-regions within India. We identify the extreme wet and dry spell patterns from the precipitation composites associated with the SOM patterns. Next, we link the contribution of the changing frequency of occurrence of the associated atmospheric patterns and increasing moisture availability in response to atmospheric warming to observed trends in these extremes. Lastly, we compare the changes in the frequency of occurrence of these atmospheric patterns in the historical and pre-industrial simulations from a single GCM to examine the influence of global warming on these extremes. Understanding the causes of these observed changes in wet and dry extremes during the monsoon season and responses to increasing global warming are relevant for managing climate-related risks, with particular relevance for water resources, agriculture, disaster preparedness, and infrastructure planning.",

            "abstract": "Earthquakes are sometimes triggered by transient stresses carried by seismic waves. There are several features of triggering that require explanation, including 1) the often-observed delay between the triggering waves and the triggered earthquakes, and 2) the effectiveness of transient stressing in the seismic frequency band. Previous theoretical and laboratory work has suggested that seismic transients should have little impact on faults if the duration of the transient is smaller than the timescale for nucleation of slip. We examine stress triggering during laboratory stick-slip sliding of granite and focus on several observations that pertain to earthquake triggering in nature. 1) Delayed triggering (clock advance) occurs when slip accumulates during the transient but remains below a critical value dc. 2) Delayed and instantaneous triggering both occur much earlier in the stick-slip cycle than expected for a simple Coulomb threshold. 3) Shorter-period (higher stressing-rate) pulses are more effective at triggering than longer-period pulses of the same stress amplitude. We use numerical simulations to show that rate-state friction can explain each of the observed features, but not all three simultaneously. Only the Ruina slip law can reproduce the observations of stressing-rate dependence and early triggering onset. The Dieterich aging law predicts only duration-dependent triggering with relatively late triggering onset. The observations show that moderate-amplitude, short-period transients can have a strong triggering effect even at durations far below the nucleation timescale. Transient oscillations at seismic frequencies may therefore be more effective at earthquake triggering than previously recognized.",

            "abstract": "Within the U.S., coastal ocean current mapping with HF radar has matured to the point where it is now considered an essential component of regional ocean observing systems. A Mid-Atlantic HF radar network now provides high-resolution coverage within five localized networks, which are linked together to cover the full range of the Mid-Atlantic coast. While the primary focus of these networks has been on offshore current mapping observations, a long-term objective has been to develop and evaluate nearshore waves and currents. Of particular interest is the height of ocean waves that play a crucial role in engineering projects, ship navigation and design, vessel traffic control as well as shoreline protection, beach erosion, and mitigation of oil spills and ocean pollution.\nThe radars owned by Rutgers University cover the coastline of New Jersey at multiple frequencies from 4.5 to 25 MHz. Their echoes contain information on both currents and waves from deep water up into the shallow coastal zone, providing an excellent archive for this study. Radar sea-echo spectra consist of dominant first-order peaks surrounded with lower-energy second-order structures. Present analysis methods assume that the waves do not interact with the ocean floor. The assumption of deep water is often invalid close to the coast and for broad continental shelves, and is particularly inadequate to describe the second-order sea-echo used to give information on ocean waves. Additionally, second-order echo is often only visible above the noise floor at close ranges.\nIn this paper, a shallow water spectral theory is implemented at four locations on the New Jersey coast- Strathmere, Wildwood, Brant Beach, and Sea Bright. The corrected wave characteristics extracted from the HF radars were then compared to several in situ wave measurements. The first three sites—Strathmere, Wildwood and Brant Beach—were validated against two long-term (1999-2007) wave gauges deployed by Stevens Institute of Technology in 5 meters of water. Based on this initial comparison, several additional corrections to the radar processing were implemented. The site at Sea Bright was used for independent verification and validated against an ADCP deployed for three weeks in March 2012.",

            "abstract": "The initial transformation of protolith into regolith has been associated with the dissolution of highly soluble minerals such as carbonates as well as oxidation of Fe(II)-minerals. The weathering of these minerals is then thought to control the formation of regolith and the emergence of secondary porosity. These reaction fronts at depth have been related to the groundwater table position and are believed to parallel the surface topography. These observations lead to the following questions: over long timescales does the water table position control nested weathering fronts, or conversely, do these reaction fronts dictate the water table position? At shorter times scales, how do processes related to the evolution of regolith influence groundwater solute fluxes?\nUnderlain entirely by shale, Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (SSHCZO) provides an ideal platform for investigating nested reaction fronts and their control on groundwater geochemistry. At SSHCZO, several ridgetop and valley floor boreholes have been drilled. Borehole optical televiewer and outcrop data define variations in geologic structure. Eighteen shallower wells further refine patterns in water table position and groundwater chemistry. Residence times of groundwater are constrained by measurement of atmospheric tracers (i.e., SF6, CFCs & 3H).\nSulfur and ferrous iron concentrations from the drill cores document that the deepest reaction front is pyrite oxidation, which is roughly coincident with the groundwater table. The drill core carbonate content from the valley floor boreholes and one ridgetop hole are indicative of a carbonate reaction concurrent with the oxidation front. However, low carbonate contents observed over four other ridgetop holes indicate a complex geometry of the carbonate dissolution front, perhaps controlled by lithological heterogeneity. Groundwater levels and geologic observations suggest the interplay between stratigraphy and topography control the water table position, and thus the location of nested reaction fronts. Elements released to groundwater due to weathering (i.e., Mg, Ca & Si) show very little variability in concentration seasonally despite their strong variations in residence time, suggesting relatively fast chemical reactions that control the fluxes from the system.",

            "abstract": "The Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 345 sampled lower crustal primitive gabbroic rocks that formed at the fast-spreading East Pacific Rise (EPR) and are exposed at the Hess Deep Rift. The metamorphic mineral assemblages in the rocks recovered at Site U1415 record the cooling of primitive gabbroic lithologies from magmatic (>1000°C) to zeolite facies conditions (<200°C) associated with EPR spreading, Cocos-Nazca rifting and exposure onto the seafloor. The dominant alteration assemblage is characterized by lower grade greenschist (<400°C) and subgreenschist facies (<200°C) alteration of olivine to talc, serpentine, or clay minerals, and is commonly accompanied by prehnite microveins in plagioclase. The intensity of alteration varies with igneous lithology, in particular, the modal abundance of olivine, as well as proximity to zones of brittle fracturing and cataclasis. We have attempted to characterize the nature and extent of isotopic exchange associated alteration and cooling and present a record of variations in O, Sr, and Nd isotopic compositions in altered rocks from the lower plutonic crust at Hess Deep. The Rb-Sr and 18O/16O systems exhibit sensitivity to hydrothermal interactions with seawater; whereas the Sm-Nd system appears essentially undisturbed by the minimal alteration experienced by the rocks drilled at Site U1415. The 87Sr/86Sr isotopic compositions of olivine gabbros (Mg# 0.81-0.89) range from 0.702536-0.703950 (±0.000008). Higher 87Sr/86Sr ratios are strongly correlated with percentage of hydrous minerals, and are higher in samples with a greater modal abundance of olivine. These rocks have somewhat higher 87Sr/86Sr ratios than upper plutonic rocks from the Northern Escarpment at Hess Deep (Kirchner and Gillis, 2012), although their percentage of hydrous phases is apparently similar. The d18O in these rocks ranges from 0.23‰ to 4.65‰ (±0.67); troctolites have systematically lower d18O than the gabbro and gabbronorites. Preliminary Nd isotopic data appears to be consistent with previous measurements from the Site 894 gabbros, implying derivation from depleted MORB (e.g. Pedersen et al., 1996).",

The primary focus of this study was to investigate FAC derived from magnetometer measurements obtained by CHAMP collocated with various auroral phenomena. Two types of aurora were studied in detail: pulsating aurora and diffuse aurora occurring equatorward ward of an established auroral arc. We found that pulsating aurora exhibited low levels of fluctuating field aligned currents alternating between +/− 1 μA/m2 for the duration of the conjunction. We found similar behaviour for diffuse aurora equatorward of stable auroral arc events. Upon entering the region of diffuse aurora CHAMP recorded an alternating current fluctuating between +/− 5 μA/m2. High resolution data confirmed this alternating current structure as well as the presence of small scale arc structure seen by larger, small time scale amplitude fluctuations similar to that seen in the auroral arcs. These results show that electrical currents in diffuse and pulsating auroral structures are relevant.",

Over the past several decades, microbial populations have been qualitatively and quantitatively characterized in marine sediments from the near shore to gyre centers, from the surface to two kilometers below the surface. Recent exploration of the underlying basement has revealed bacterial populations within the basalt. Initial cultivation-based and in situ analysis of subsurface basalt has produced some structural identification of populations that have the potential to alter the crust. Within this study, we have advanced this understanding by characterizing the metabolically active fraction of these populations. A 16S rRNA gene transcript approach was conducted using high throughput sequencing on RNA extracted from breccia, glass basalts and ultramafic basalts of the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Previous research has shown that the fluid within the basement is oxic. As expected, populations associated with aerobic metabolism were detected. In addition, iron-utilizing populations were observed to be metabolically active within the basalt samples characterized. Future characterization will reveal overlap between previous studies to determine the total versus metabolically active populations.",

The Miocene-Holocene deposits of the Meade Basin, southwestern Kansas preserve a record of C4 ecosystem expansion as well as a rich fossil record of small mammals. These records combined provide an excellent opportunity to study the cause(s) of the C4 ecosystem expansion and the consequences for faunal evolution. As part of an interdisciplinary project, we are investigating the organic geochemical record of vegetation and hydrological change in the Meade Basin. Preliminary findings from three modern soil pits suggest n-alkane δ¹³C values have similar trends to n-alkanoic acid δ¹³C values in each soil profile, but the absolute values of these two different types of plant-wax compounds are offset by up to 6.8‰. This result was unexpected because the absolute δ¹³C values of n-alkanes and n-alkanoic acids are assumed to be very similar in the plants themselves. Moreover, the δ¹³C values of the n-alkanoic acids more accurately reflect the modern vegetation at our sites. Few studies compare carbon isotope data in n-alkanes and n-alkanoic acids and it is important to constrain how these two types of plant-wax compounds reflect vegetation differently. We will use hydrogen isotope measurements on these same plant-wax samples to evaluate how the modern precipitation isotopic ratios are recorded in biomarkers, which in turn will be used to interpret hydrogen isotope data from paleosol biomarkers. Ongoing work will use plant-wax isotopic records from the modern soil profiles as a framework for interpreting the plant-wax isotopic records from Meade Basin paleosol and fluvial sediments to reconstruct the late Neogene C4 grassland expansion and hydroclimate change in this region.",

We detect small-scale explosive events that are likely to be boosted by the interactions of magnetic field lines at the chromospheric level and therefore triggered by the evolution of the light bridge in the photosphere beneath. In particular a very localized explosive event reaching the transition region and coronal temperatures is observed from simultaneous IRIS and SDO data.",

            "abstract": "In central Peru the combination of an unusually shallow Wadati-Benioff zone and lack of arc volcanism are indicators of flat slab subduction and are associated with both the ongoing subduction of the Nazca Ridge and the prior subduction of the Inca Plateau. Data from the PULSE experiment has allowed us to better constrain the geometry of the southern half of the Peruvian flat slab through analysis of teleseismic receiver functions, Pn and Sn phases from regional intermediate (>100 km depth) and deep (>500 km depth) earthquakes at the margins of the flat slab region, and teleseismic tomgraphy.\nWe observe a low velocity anomaly below the subducted portion of the Nazca Ridge in the teleseismic S-wave tomography. Utilizing both Pn and Sn phases from regional intermediate and deep earthquakes at the margins of the flat slab, we have found significant travel time delays for propagation paths passing through this anomaly, confirming the presence of this low velocity anomaly under the flat slab. This anomaly likely contributes to the buoyancy of this segment of the flat slab, increasing the coupling with the upper plate. Both the teleseismic tomographic and our receiver function results indicate that the southern segment of the Peruvian flat slab extends locally more than 100 km further inboard than previous estimates. As the shallow portion of the slab inboard of the subducting Nazca Ridge is largely aseismic, these new results help to better constrain the geometry of the Peruvian flat slab as it re-subducts back into the mantle. Between 10°S and 16°S the subducted oceanic crust along the inboard projection of the Nazca Ridge lies at a depth of 60 km to 70 km while subducted crust immediately north and south of the ridge projection lies at depths of 80 km to 90 km suggesting the slab is sinking north and south of the ridge. The unusually shallow depth of the slab along the ridge’s projection may indicate that the subducted Nazca Plate is coupled to the South American Plate far inboard from the trench. This coupling may be causing deformation beyond the active Andean thrust front. The Fitzcarrald Arch, a long-wavelength topographic feature along the ridge’s projection and east of the edge of Andean deformation, lies immediately inboard of our shallowest observed subducted oceanic crust and may be an example of this coupling induced deformation.",

            "abstract": "Waves, currents, and sand levels were observed on a 1.4 km-long cross-shore transect extending from the back beach to ~11 m water depth at Agate Beach, Oregon in Fall 2013. Wave runup and water table fluctuations on this low slope (1:80) beach were measured with a cliff-mounted scanning Lidar and buried pressure sensors. Significant wave heights at an offshore buoy in 128m depth ranged from small (0.5m) to extreme (7.5m), with peak periods between 4-22 seconds. Infragravity frequency (nominally 0.01 Hz) horizontal runup excursions exceeded 100m, and infragravity cross-shore velocity exceeded 3 m/s. Cross-shore patterns of infragravity wave energy flux, observed with seven co-located pressure and current meters, indicate ‘proto-saturation’ of the inner surfzone in extreme conditions. That is, the intensification of incident wave forcing (e.g. higher energy, longer swell) leads to a wider surfzone and an increase in the shoreward infragravity wave energy seaward of the surfzone, but produces more modest increases in flux in the inner surfzone, and in the runup. Nonlinear energy balances, based on the observations, show transfer of energy from sea-swell to infragravity waves, and vice-versa. The infragravity energy balance closes in cases with low energy incident sea-swell. With more energetic incident waves, there is an unexplained inner surfzone energy sink at the lowest IG frequencies (0.004-0.02 Hz). Ongoing work aims to quantify the effect on infragravity energy balances by infragravity wave breaking and bottom friction. Additionally, the estimates may be degraded by contamination with rotational velocities of surfzone eddies. Whatever the dynamical explanation, infragravity wave runup on a low slope beach in high-energy conditions is limited significantly by dissipation. The slow rate of runup increase suggests nascent, or ‘proto’ saturation. This work was supported by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.",

            "abstract": "Understanding past compositional changes in vegetation provides insight about ecosystem dynamics in response to changing environments. Past vegetation reconstructions rely predominantly on fossil pollen data from sedimentary lake cores, which acts as a proxy record for the surrounding vegetation. Stratigraphic changes in these pollen records allow us to infer changes in composition and species distributions. Pollen records collected from a network of sites allow us to make inference about the spatio-temporal changes in vegetation over thousands of years. However, the complexity of the relationship between pollen deposits and surrounding vegetation, as well as the spatially sparse set of fossil pollen sites are important sources of uncertainty. In addition, uncertainty arises from the carbon dating and age-depth modelling processes.\nTo reconstruct vegetation composition including uncertainty for the Upper Midwestern USA, we build a Bayesian hierarchical model that links vegetation composition to fossil pollen data via a dispersal model. In the calibration phase, we estimate the relationship between vegetation and pollen for the settlement era using Public Land Survey data and a network of pollen records. In the prediction phase, parameter estimates obtained during the calibration phase are used to estimate latent species distributions and relative abundances over the last 2500 years.\nWe account for additional uncertainty in the pollen records by: allowing expert palynologists to identify pre-settlement pollen samples to be included in our calibration data, and through the incorporation of age uncertainty obtained from the Bayesian age-depth model BACON in our prediction data.\nResulting spatio-temporal composition and abundance estimates will be used to improve forecasting capabilities of ecosystem models.",

            "abstract": "We present a new North American lacustrine PSV record spanning the last ~ 33 ka from Fish Lake, Utah. Eleven meters of sediment were recovered from three holes with overlapping drives using a UWITECH coring system. Magnetic susceptibility was measured in the field to ensure stratigraphic completeness and to provide real time information on the material recovered. The recovered lake stratigraphy includes three distinct facies, interpreted to represent the post-glacial (0.75-6.75 m), last glacial maximum (LGM)/deglaciation (6.75-9.5 m), and pre-LGM period (9.5-11.75 m), with an initial chronology constrained by ten radiocarbon dates. CT scans were made on each section and used to monitor for coring deformation and establish precise stratigraphic correlation. Magnetic remanence was studied using AF demagnetization of u-channel samples measured on the OSU 2-G Enterprises u-channel magnetometer. The NRM is characterized by a viscous remanent magnetization (VRM), present throughout the core but successfully removed by 20 mT AF demagnetization. Weak NRM intensities in the post-glacial interval (3-6 x 10-4 A/m before AF demagnetization and 1-3 x 10-4 A/m following 20 mT AF demagnetization) approach the sensitivity of the u-channel magnetometer with increasing demagnetization and result in high MAD values during PCA analysis. Accordingly, we choose to use the NRM measured after 20 mT AF demagnetization for the post-glacial sediments to avoid both the VRM overprint and noise introduced due to week intensities at higher demagnetization steps. Major inclination features are consistent with other western North American PSV records providing confidence in this approach. NRM intensities are significantly higher below 6.75 m, reflecting increased terrigenous input during the LGM/deglaciation and pre LGM periods. A stable magnetization is isolated using a PCA over the 20-60 mT AF demagnetization steps, yielding MAD values of <1 and ~2, respectively. Declination is rotated to a mean of zero and inclinations vary around geocentric axial dipole predictions for the site’s location further suggesting that a reliable PSV record is preserved. The continuous PSV record reveals higher amplitude swings during the late Pleistocene. Here we assess the reliability and implications of these observations.",

            "abstract": "A comprehensive study of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) hydrology has been carried out in order to improve understanding of the coastal freshwater discharge (FWD) magnitude and spatial distribution, and mass changes from GOA glaciers. FWD along the coastline and surface mass balance (SMB) for all glacier surfaces in the GOA drainage were modeled using a suite of physically-based, spatially distributed weather, energy-balance snow/ice melt, and runoff-routing models at a high resolution (1-km horizontal grid; 3-h time step). SnowModel simulations of air temperature, precipitation, surface runoff, and glacier SMB were completed for the entire GOA drainage from 1979-2009. HydroFlow was used to route the SnowModel-derived runoff to the GOA coastline. Meteorological forcing was provided by the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) dataset. The NARR data was bias-corrected using monthly gridded climate data to more accurately reflect the strong spatial gradients in air temperature and precipitation, while retaining the temporal attributes of NARR. The most recent version of the Alaska Glacier Inventory was used to define the glacier cover for the model simulations. The modeling system was validated and calibrated in several glaciated catchments containing long-term streamflow and glacier mass balance datasets, as well as several non-glaciated catchments with only streamflow data. The overall GOA mean annual FWD volumes from HydroFlow agree well with previous estimates. Glacier SMB simulated by SnowModel from 2004-2009 produced seasonal storage changes and long term trends consistent with GRACE satellite-based estimates. Both SnowModel and GRACE data suggest a negative SMB trend which indicates that recent glacier volume loss contributes significantly to GOA FWD. The final product of this study is a 30-year record of daily streamflow at every coastal grid cell (1-km resolution) in the GOA drainage, which includes the runoff signal from glacier melt and volume loss. This information is valuable to physical oceanographers and ecologists studying marine systems in the GOA.",

Therefore, to investigate the microbial transformation of fixed nitrogen compounds in crustal aquifer fluids, fluids were sampled from different horizons of two neighbouring CORK (Circulation Obviation Retrofit Kit) observatories at the North Pond sediment pond. This site is located on the western flank of the Mid Atlantic Ridge and is characterized by relatively young oceanic crust and cold fluids. The crustal fluids contain oxygen and nitrate, which potentially both may serve as electron acceptor for respiration. In a multidisciplinary approach we combined stable isotope incubations, determination of the natural isotopic compositions and plan to analyse relevant functional genes from a metagenomic dataset to investigate the nitrogen cycling at North Pond. The turnover of fixed nitrogen in oceanic crustal fluids may have important implications for the understanding of the global nitrogen cycle.",

            "abstract": "The Zambales ophiolite region in the Philippines contains high pH springs associated with serpentinization. At the surface where calcium-saturated ­fluids mix with air, fluid becomes aerobic and diffusion of CO2 occurs. At depth, there are low concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon and O2, and high concentrations of CH4 and H2. Redox potential of iron in the fluids is largely dependent on pH. Fe2+ is unstable at a high pH, and spontaneously reacts with atmospheric O2 to form Fe3+, which is then hydrolysed to ferrihydrite. The reaction kinetics may be too rapid for microbes to harness energy for growth, however cells have been documented to act as nucleation sites for ferrihydrite precipitation in natural environments. Precipitates that sink to the subsurface act as substrates for microbes where they may carry out Fe3+ reduction in the presence of H2. Predictions made about Gibbs energy of reaction for iron metabolisms in serpentinizing systems show that Fe3+ reduction in the subsurface is energetically favorable (Fig. 1A) (Cardace, et al., 2013).\nSpring fluid and rock samples from the Zambales region were collected in September 2013. Time series microcosms including sample rock, spring fluid, and gas simulating the spring surface and subsurface (Fig. 1B) will investigate microbial growth rates and microbial reaction products over one year. Microcosms will undergo cell counts via fluorescence microscopy, SEM, and XRD to examine cell growth rates, microbial action on mineral surfaces, minerals forming around cells, and changes in mineralogy. After one year, microbial community structure and iron metabolizers will be identified via DNA sequencing.­­\nSurface microcosms are expected to show abiotic oxidation of Fe2+ and formation of Fe3+ precipitates preferentially around cells acting as nucleation sites (except in abiotic control microcosms). Subsurface microcosms are expected to show biotic reduction of Fe3+ and signs of microbial action on mineral surfaces. This activity will increase directly with increasing cell growth, and will not be evident in abiotic control microcosms. Evidence of reduced iron mineral formation over time will be seen, and DNA sequencing will yield consistent results with microbes capable of metabolizing iron, thus demonstrating microbially-influenced iron cycling in this system.",

This is especially evident around the subduction zones where most of the top ten strongest earthquakes have been recorded in the last century.\nAddressing the coupled nature of the two phenomena requires concurrent simulations. Accordingly, this study deals with the simulation of strongly-coupled subduction zone earthquakes, with a focus on the generation of tsunami waves.\nWe present an application to the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake and tsunami employing a multi-system finite element method for the elastoacoustic problem. In the past, we have reported on the simulation capabilities of Hercules, our finite element tool, for earthquake scenarios such as ShakeOut and Chino-Hills using ideal anelastic material models with kinematic faulting. With the latest improvements we have introduced into Hercules, we can now incorporate oceans and the attendant gravity waves into our three-dimensional simulations.\nWe examine the relationship between the fault rupture, the generation of the tsunami, and the ocean’s effects on the propagation of seismic waves through the solid and acoustic media. Additionally, we clarify the validity of common assumptions made for the tsunami generation mechanism with classical tsunami simulation methods. While our focus is on the physical interpretation of the results and its comparison with observations, we also report on the current understanding of the geologic structure of the Japan Trench, computing resources, and the numerical method.",

            "abstract": "Numerical simulations were performed for the Mouth of the Columbia River (MCR) using a 3D ocean circulation model (ROMS) two-way coupled to a phase-averaged wave propagation model (SWAN) within the framework of a collaborative project called DARLA (Data Assimilation and Remote Sensing for Littoral Applications) funded by the Office of Naval Research (ONR). Model results were compared against an extensive data set obtained during the Riverine and Estuarine Transport II (RIVET II) experiment done in May-June, 2013. Data sources used in the aforementioned multi-institution effort experiment include CTD casts, SAR, RADAR, LIDAR and SWIFT measurements and thus present a unique chance to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the model output. In order to assess the model performance quantitatively, root mean square (RMS) error, bias, model skill and scatter index were used. In general, the model is able reproduce the temporal and spatial behavior of the momentum and scalar transport (temperature and salinity). Also, modeled wave parameters are in good agreement with the LIDAR and RADAR observations. Finally, the effect of the river plume on the waves and vice versa is discussed and advantages and disadvantages of nesting from a realistic outer model are reported.",

            "abstract": "Land use change (LUC) has a significant impact on both above- and below-ground carbon (C) stocks; however, little is known about the net effects of urban LUC on the C cycle and climate system. Moreover, as climate change becomes an increasingly pressing concern, there is growing evidence that urban policy and management decisions can have significant regional impacts on C dynamics. Soil organic carbon (SOC) varies significantly across ecoregions at global and continental scales due to differential sensitivity of primary production, substrate quality, and organic matter decay to changes in temperature and soil moisture. These factors are highly modified by urban LUC due to vegetation removal, soil relocation and disruption, pollution, urban heat island effects, and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations. As a result, on a global scale urban LUC differentially affects the C cycle from ecoregion to ecoregion.\nFor urban ecosystems, the data collected thus far suggests urbanization can lead to both an increase and decrease in soil C pools and fluxes, depending on the native ecosystem being impacted by urban development. For example, in drier climates, urban landscapes accumulate higher C densities than the native ecosystems they replaced. Results suggest also that soil C storage in urban ecosystems is highly variable with very high (> 20.0) and low (< 2.0) C densities (kg m-2 to a 1 m depth) present in the landscape at any one time. Moreover, similar to non-urban soils, total SOC densities are consistently 2-fold greater than aboveground stocks. For those soils with low SOC densities, there is potential to increase C sequestration through management, but specific urban related management practices need to be evaluated. In addition, urban LUC is a human-driven process and thus can be modified or adjusted to reduce its impacts on the C cycle. For example, policies that influence development patterns, population density, management practices, and other human factors can greatly ameliorate the impact of urban LUC on the C cycle. However, even with the recent and rapid expansion of newly acquired data, the net effects of urban LUC on C stocks and fluxes have not been comprehensively addressed. Furthermore, how sensitive these changes are to urban planning, policy decisions, and site management needs to be explored.",

            "abstract": "Changes in the water cycle components of the Amazon and its surrounding regions are a key to assessing regional impacts of climate and land-cover changes, as they may affect rain-fed agriculture and hydroelectric power generation in Brazil. A comprehensive validation of the modeled water budget, therefore, is a necessary part of understanding the region’s hydroclimatology. We evaluate the water cycle components from Ecosystem Demography (ED) model both as a stand-alone model and a coupled model to the Brazilian Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (BRAMS). Model results are compared with satellite-driven observations and a flux tower measurement in central Amazon. Our results indicate that the modeled EDBRAMS precipitation over Amazonia replicates the observed patterns of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) from 2001 to 2009. Total Water Storage Change (TWSC) anomalies from the ED model at the Paraná River basin shows a better agreement with the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite observation from 2002 to 2008, as compared to the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS)/NOAH model. The Nash-Sutcliff model efficiency coefficient improved from 0.50 (GLDAS/NOAH vs. GRACE) to 0.65 (ED vs. GRACE). We also evaluate the modeled evapotranspiration (ET) against the flux tower measurement. Our study affirms the capabilities of the ED model in simulating the Amazon hydrological cycle, which helps investigate its sustainable thresholds with various land-cover and climate change scenarios.",

            "abstract": "The static strength and dynamic shear resistance of seismic faults depend on composition, shape, spatial variability, and distribution of asperities on fault surfaces. To characterize these qualities in a paleoseismic fault, we studied the Boyd Fault, a Laramide thrust exposed in crystalline rocks south of Palm Desert, CA. High-resolution digital elevation models of outcrops were rectified with fault strike and dip and used to map 62 m of exposed fault core in the field at three exposures over 175 m along fault strike. The fault core exhibits stratified layers of fault gouge of varying thicknesses with crosscutting relationships and discontinuous layers. One layer is interpreted as the most recent slip event because it crosscuts all the others and has injection veins branching into both the footwall and hanging wall. Microstructures and the presence of gouge injections indicate fluidization of the gouge throughout the fault slip zone during seismic slip. We compared the geometry of the most recent slip event to the fault core as a whole to constrain how the characteristics of the fault evolve with displacement. We found four “thresholds”: a. the length scales at which the variance of 1. total fault core thickness and 2. the most recent gouge layer thickness do not fluctuate and remain stable, via experimental semivariograms; b. the length scale at which wear is scale dependent, via power spectral density (PSD) calculations from cross sections through the most recent layer and the fault core; and c. the scale at which fault wear transitions from inelastic to elastic, via the maximum length of hanging wall asperity clasts in the fault gouge. By comparing the most recent event with the core as a whole, these results indicate that faults smooth with displacement, but clast compositions provide evidence of preferential wear due to wall rock composition differences. In addition, slip zone thickness decreases and becomes less variable. We suggest the correlation length scale in the slip zone thickness defines the length scale of an asperity on the fault surface. Overall, our results indicate an evolution of the size and distribution of asperities, implying dynamic shear strength and the static strength of the fault also vary with increasing displacement.",

            "abstract": "The water isotopologue HDO is a tracer of water cycle processes including land surface evaporation and transpiration. We use satellite observations to quantify the diurnal variation of HDO and H2O in the atmospheric boundary layer (surface to 800 hPa), as this diurnal variation is associated with evaporation and transpiration (Ueta et al. 2013) and has not been extensively explored on a global scale. We characterize the spatial, seasonal, and interannual patterns of the diurnal variation of δD (a measure of HDO abundance) and we investigate the probable drivers of the diurnal variation in different regions and seasons, with particular focus on the Amazon basin. We analyze nine years (September 2004 to June 2013) of TES Lite data from the Aura satellite. We find that the average diurnal variation for each hemisphere changes seasonally from ~ 120 ‰ during each hemisphere’s respective winter to ~ -5 ‰ in the summer. In the northern hemisphere, observations over land follow a similar but damped cycle to the aggregate (ocean and land) data, with winter values of ~ 100 ‰ and summer values ~ 10‰. Average diurnal variation for land in the southern hemisphere is ~ 30‰, but does not follow a clear annual cycle. Diurnal variation of δD in the Amazon basin does not significantly correlate with southern hemisphere, or global trends. Surface temperature changes, vegetation type and amount, the rate of transpiration relative to evaporation, and transport of water vapor by lateral advection and convective entrainment all may contribute to observed diurnal variation. We assess these possible mechanisms using an atmospheric box model, and estimate the importance of each mechanism for different regions.",

            "abstract": "This study investigates the biogeophysical impacts of human-induced land cover change, particularly crops, on the regional climate of North America, using the fifth generation Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM5). To this effect, two simulations are performed with CRCM5 with different land cover datasets – one corresponding to the potential vegetation (i.e. without land use change) and the other corresponding to current land use. Most of the land use changes are concentrated over the US mid-west and south-central Canada, where forests and grasses have been replaced by crops. This transformation changes the surface parameters, particularly vegetation fractional area, leaf area index, albedo, roughness length and rooting depth among other variables, in the regions where land cover change takes place in these simulations. Both simulations span the 1988–2012 period and are driven by ERA-Interim at the lateral boundaries. The sea surface temperature and sea ice cover that vary inter-annually are also taken from ERA-Interim. Results suggest that regions where forests/grasses were replaced by crops generally show increases in albedo, particularly during the spring, fall and winter seasons, with the increase in albedo being largest for winter. This higher increase in albedo during winter is due to a snow-mediated positive feedback. The increased albedo values during winter, spring and fall are reflected in the cooler 2 meter temperature obtained in the simulation with land use change, compared to that with potential vegetation. Some cooling is observed in the summer for the simulation with land use change, mostly due to the increased latent heat fluxes. Increases in precipitation are noted for these regions, but are not statistically significant.",

            "abstract": "During magnetic storms, the concentration of O+ ions in the ring current can increase substantially. The mechanisms that energize these O+ ions so that they gain enough energy to escape from the ionosphere into the magnetosphere have long been debated. The highly sensitive HOPE (Helium, Oxygen, Proton, and Electron) instrument onboard the Van Allen Probe satellites provide an opportunity to investigate this problem. The two satellites are in nearly identical highly-elliptical, low-inclination (~10°) orbits with a perigee of 1.1 Earth radii (RE), an apogee of 5.8 RE, and a period of ~9 hours. We study a storm event whose SSC occurred near 15:00 UT on 31 May 2013 followed by a lengthy initial phase. The main phase began early on 1 June, reaching a Sym-H minimum of - 134 nT at 07:54 UT. We have identified a large energetic proton enhancement event which is marked by a significant increase in the fluxes of high-energy ions in the deep portion of the main phase. We concentrate on the relative dynamics of H+ and O+. From 03:00 UT to 06:50 UT, there were a few quasi-periodic enhancements of O+ fluxes in the 200 eV to 3.5 keV energy range. A Fourier analysis shows clear power around 30 min periods and excellent coherence among these channels. These enhancements further show clear dispersion with high-energy channels increasing first followed by lower energy channels. During the event, the satellites were near the apogee in the pre-midnight local time sector. The location of the source region can be inferred by energy dispersion based on the time-of-flight effect. One may show that if the particles in different energies were produced at the same time and location, time is linearly correlated with the reciprocal of square-root of the energy for the enhanced fluxes and the source distance can be derived by the slope of the lines of enhanced fluxes. During the event, we identified 8 such enhancements. The sources of these O+ ions appear to be from similar distance to the satellite. Other features during the event will be presented and discussed.",

            "abstract": "Electromagnetic data images mantle regions more conductive than that of dry olivine. There is no doubt that melt is thermodynamically stable and present in the LAB, but how they can impact on mantle electrical conductivity remains debated. In addition, gravitational segregation and fast melt upwelling, being expected if melt fraction exceeds 2 vol. %, is thought to seriously restrict the role of partial melting at the level of the LAB. Petrological studies realized some 30 years ago have shown that peridotites exposed at the P-T-fO2 conditions of the LAB produced H2O and CO2 rich-melts. The segregation of such melts is not expected since they constitute only about 0.5 vol. % of the peridotite, but electrical conductivities of these melts are poorly known.\nTherefore, electrical conductivity experiments have been performed in piston cylinder on H2O-CO2 rich melts. Different melt compositions have been explored, from carbonated melts to basalts. The effects of chemical compositions and volatiles on these melts have been determined. The electrical conductivity measurements have shown that hydrous carbonated melts are very conductive, and the incorporation of basalt decreases the conductivity. With these new data, a semi-empirical law predicting the conductivity as a function of H2O and CO2 contents has been produced. Based on this law and the electrical conductivity of olivine, 1D conductivity profiles were constructed. With these profiles, the effect of volatiles content (partitioned between the melt and in the solids), melt fractions (mixing law and interconnection of the melt) and different temperature regimes on conductivity are discussed. These calculations are conducted on oceanic and continental settings with different ages. The electrical conductivities of the mantle is thus a powerful tool to track the fundamental process of mantle incipient melting, which is in turn narrowly associated to the cycling of H2O and CO2 in the upper mantle.",

            "abstract": "Bangladesh is a country characterized by numerous natural disasters. These natural hazards occur both on the surface (e.g., flooding due to river avulsions) and within the subsurface (e.g., earthquakes) (see figure), and both types have been related to regional tectonic activity. Bangladesh is also one of the most highly populated countries in the world with a capital city, Dhaka, host to 17 million people. This urban center is located only 40 km south east from the Madhupur Tract, a potentially tectonically hazardous region. In order to determine this region’s tectonic hazard potential, recent studies have attempted to detect and identify significant neotectonic signatures of the tract, such as faults, lineaments, and weak zones within the region. Recent earthquake evidence along the Madhupur Fault strongly supports the fact that the area is tectonically unstable and quite vulnerable to further seismicity, placing the fast-growing and densely populated Dhaka city in potential danger (see figure).\nThe Madhupur Tract is in central Bangladesh, and is surrounded by the Jamuna-Brahmaputra river floodplain. Previous research suggests the uplift of the Madhupur Tract may have exerted a significant control on the avulsion history of the Jamuna River. The Jamuna river avulsion history is cyclic, with a periodicity of about 2000 years. Within these cycles, the Jamuna’s position has fluctuated from west to east and east to west, repeatedly (Pickering et al. 2013). As this avulsion history is thought to be, at least partly, related to seismicity in the region, future seismicity has the potential to cause future river avulsions and related flooding.\nThe Madhupur Tract is an exposed Quaternary deposit. It is believed that 1885 Bengal earthquake may have been caused by the rupture of the Madhupur blind fault (see figure). However, there is no paleo-seismological evidence, since it is an intra-plate active fault.\nThe principle aim of this research is to identify the location of the Madhupur fault and determine the connection between activity along the fault and the avulsion history of the Jamuna River. To this end, we aim to determine, more precisely, the intensity of the fault, the local lithology using resistivity survey data, and ultimately the exact cause of Jamuna River avulsion.",

            "abstract": "We use an extensive spectroscopic dataset of 1000 observations of Io in [OI] 6300A, presented by Oliversen et al. (2001), narrow-band images of the torus in [SII] 6731A, and HST/STIS EUV observations of Io and its environs to confirm that the Io [OI] flux is an excellent proxy for the electron density in the Io plasma to torus (IPT). Furthermore, we find:\n(1) A careful statistical analysis of short-term variations in this dataset (20 min to 1 hour), previously suspected to be from flux tube interchange (Oliversen et al. 2001, Morgenthaler et al. 2012) are, in fact, consistent with the expected statistical variation of the parent population of observations.\n(2) The semi-empirical IPT model developed by W. Smyth (Oliversen et al. 2001; Smyth, Peterson, & Marconi 2011) fits the overall trends in the data reasonably well, with notable exceptions.\n(3) There may be a link between what was previously known the \"active sector\" at system III longitudes of 170 ~ 230 degrees and the modulation in IPT plasma density caused by the beating between system III and system IV, predicted by Hess et al. (2011).\nConclusion: a simple modification to the W. Smyth semi-empirical torus model to incorporate a system IV-controlled density enhancement, rather than a fixed \"active sector\" in system III, should enable the model to \"lock in\" more readily to our extensive set of [OI] 6300A observations recorded between 1990 and 2008. This will provide detailed information about the flow of mass and energy in the IPT during the Galileo, Ulysses, Cassini, and New Horizons missions.

            "abstract": "Stable isotope analysis of the endangered Hawaiian petrel’s (Pterodroma sandwichensis, HAPE) feathers provides otherwise intractable information regarding non-breeding season foraging habits. Adult HAPE spend 3.5-6 months at sea during the non-breeding season, at which time they sequentially molt their flight feathers. Because feathers are metabolically inert once synthesized, they capture isotopic signals while they are grown, providing an opportunity to study foraging habits over time. Here we use stable hydrogen (δD), carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotopes to assess variation in foraging habits within and between individuals, and among four breeding colonies. δD is an indicator of prevalence of fish vs. invertebrates in the diet. In one analysis, we observed large variation in feather δD (125‰), with adults from Maui and Kauai having significantly higher δD values than corresponding hatch-year birds, indicating significant dietary differences between age groups. In a second analysis, we utilized δ13C and δ15N of Hawaii, Maui and Lanai adults, values which vary with trophic level and also at the base of the food web across HAPE’s foraging range, potentially revealing information about feeding location, as well as diet. Furthermore, because the sequence of molt is known, we are able to determine whether individual foraging specialization (continued use of the same foraging behavior over time) exists in this species. To do this, we analyzed two primary feathers, P1 and P6, which reflect the beginning and the middle of the non-breeding season, respectively. We did not find significant differences in δ13C or δ15N between P1 and P6, suggesting consistent foraging habits within individuals over time. This provides evidence that individual foraging specialization exists within these populations. Analysis of a secondary feather grown late in the molt sequence would further illuminate the extent of foraging specialization. Finally, δ15N differs significantly between Hawaii and Maui adults, suggesting foraging segregation between these two populations. HAPE may be sensitive to changes in prey availability, given evidence of foraging specialization. However, conserving HAPE populations with apparently different foraging habits may be critical to preserve ecological diversity within the species.",

            "abstract": "Morphodynamic feedbacks result in alternating bars within channels, and the resulting convective accelerations dictate the cross-stream force balance of channels and in turn influence morphology. Pioneer woody riparian trees recruit on river bars and may steer flow and alter this force balance. This study uses two-dimensional hydraulic modeling to test the sensitivity of the flow field to riparian vegetation at the reach scale. We use two test systems with different width-to-depth ratios, substrate sizes, and vegetation structure: the gravel-bed Bitterroot River, MT and the sand-bed Santa Maria River, AZ. We model vegetation explicitly as a drag force by spatially specifying vegetation density, height, and drag coefficient, across varying hydraulic (e.g., discharge, eddy viscosity) conditions and compare velocity vectors between runs. We test variations in vegetation configurations, including the present-day configuration of vegetation in our field systems (extracted from LiDAR), removal of vegetation (e.g., from floods or management actions), and expansion of vegetation. Preliminary model runs suggest that the sensitivity of convective accelerations to vegetation reflects a balance between the extent and density of vegetation inundated and other sources of channel roughness. This research quantifies how vegetation alters hydraulics at the reach scale, a fundamental step to understanding vegetation-morphodynamic interactions.",

            "abstract": "A novel approach of combining cryogenic coring of sediments with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of frozen soil cores is reported. Cryogenic coring has the potential to preserve critical properties of soil cores including the distribution of pore fluids. MRI can provide information on the qualitative and quantitative spatial distribution of non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) contaminants within the cores. Initial results of field-scale cryogenic coring indicated that injecting liquid nitrogen through a cooling coil around a soil core (6.3 cm diameter and 75 cm long) could freeze the core below the water table (water table at 7.2 m) in less than 15 minutes. MRI scanning of soil cores contaminated with trichloroethene (TCE) NAPL indicated that keeping the cores frozen at -20°C can suppress the competing MRI signals of water-bound hydrogen. Comparison of known and measured TCE NAPL saturation using MRI in spiked frozen soil samples showed close agreement. The results confirm the ability of cryogenic coring to prevent redistribution of pore fluids during sample withdrawal and storage. The results of MRI illustrate the ability of this method to discriminate between water and TCE in frozen cores, thus allowing for a sensitive spatial analysis of contaminant distribution. Overall, this novel combined approach has the potential to lower the cost of site investigation while providing an improved basis for site characterization and management.",

            "abstract": "Aeolis Mons, informally called “Mount Sharp,” is a >5 km tall mound of layered sedimentary rock in Gale crater. The mound can be divided into lower and upper formations, with a clear unconformity between the two formations identified by Malin and Edgett (2000). Multiple authors (e.g. Anderson and Bell, 2010; Thomson et al., 2011; Wray, 2012) have noted that the upper formation may have a distinct origin from the lower mound. Although the Curiosity rover is expected to explore the base of the lower formation, the upper portion of Aeolis Mons is likely unreachable. HiRISE observations of the upper formation reveal sinuous bedding patterns on a scale of 100s of meters with apparent truncations. These patterns have been interpreted to be cross-beds (Anderson and Bell, 2010). However, identifying cross-bedding in orbital images is not always straightforward. Planar beds intersecting eroded topography can produce complex patterns of exposed bedding that may look superficially like cross-bedding. To confirm the presence of cross-bedding, the exposure must be studied in three dimensions.\nWe present initial results of an investigation using a HiRISE Digital Terrain Model (DTM) based on the HiRISE stereo pair PSP_001620_1750 and PSP_001422_1750 test the hypothesis that the upper formation of Aeolis Mons represents aeolian cross-bedding. By tracing the intersection of the beds with a plane, we will determine whether the observed patterns might be explained by the interaction of planar beds and complex erosion or if the observed structures require cross-bedded deposits. These measurements are ongoing. If the complex bedding patterns observed in the upper formation are confirmed to be cross-beds, we will present measurements of the bedding orientation and use computer models to interpret the depositional conditions for the upper formation of Aeolis Mons.\nAnderson, R., Bell, J.F., 2010.

Such disparity in river usage causes Tajikistan to consider heavy investments in hydropower dams that will increase social and political tension between counterparts. Traditional irrigation under arid climate causes high rates of water losses in infiltration and evapotranspiration leading to land. Water stress analysis and water resources distribution under climate change and possible adaptation measures were investigated. The framework includes model to analyze available water resources and assessment of the basin efficiency including dam operation and irrigation demand, based on it adaptation measures were suggested. Comparison of the increasing irrigation efficiency in downstream to the 10% rate can decrease water requirements on early stages, however there are still large deficiency of the water resources in the peak irrigation season. Dam operation to benefit irrigation has positive impact while can't compensate the needs of energy in winter months. Cooperation of the both sides are required to address such changes in river flow as interest lies on opposite side. Increasing irrigation efficiency through using return marginal waters and salt tolerant crops under water stress were suggested. The plants were tested on several sites in the downstream of the river using mineralized return waters. The results suggest that using such plants can provide additional outcome for the local community while decreasing demand of the water resources and improving soil conditions. Combination of dam operation for energy production and increasing irrigation efficiency additionally by using return waters can provide a beneficial scenario for the region under future climate change. However, it will require strong political will to address energy swap to achieve nexus on water resources distribution between counterparts.",

            "abstract": "The mechanical properties of organic matter strongly influence the way in which shales deform and fracture. However, the response of organic matter to mechanical stresses is not well understood, representing a critical obstacle to assessing oil and gas production in shale formations. Little is known about the mechanical properties of organic matter in fine grained rocks primarily because it often occupies tiny nanometer-scale voids between the mineral grains which cannot be accessed using standard mechanical testing techniques. Here, we report on the use of a new atomic force microscopy technique (PeakForce QNM) to map the mechanical properties of organic and inorganic components at the nanometer scale. We find that the method can identify different phases such as pyrite, quartz, clays, and organic matter. Furthermore, within the organic component Young's modulus values ranged from 0 - 25 GPa; in 3 different samples - all of which come from thermally mature Type II/III source rocks in the dry gas window - a modal value of 15-16 GPa was measured, with additional peaks measured at ≤ 10 GPa. In addition, the maps suggest that some porous organic macerals possess a soft core surrounded by a harder outer shell 50 – 100 nm thick. Our results demonstrate that the method represents a powerful new petrographic tool with which to characterize the mechanical properties of organic-rich sedimentary rocks. ",

This forcing is linked to the large-scale ocean dynamics and climate via the shelf-basin exchange and its resulting impact on the stratification and ventilation of the interior basin.\nHere we evaluate the role that a realistic runoff forcing has on the hydrography and dynamics of the Labrador Sea by comparing results from two simulations using a subset of the Regional Arctic System Model (RASM). RASM is a regional earth system model, however in this study the atmospheric (Weather and Research Forecasting – WRF) and land (Variable Infiltration Capacity - VIC) model components are replaced with prescribed realistic atmospheric reanalysis data. Its ocean and sea ice models (Parallel Ocean Program - POP and Los Alamos Sea Ice - CICE models, respectively) are the only model components that are actively coupled via the flux coupler (CPL7). This model has a high spatial resolution of 1/12oin the horizontal and 45 levels in the vertical direction. The results of two simulations are analyzed which vary only in the way that sea surface salinity is determined: i) restored to monthly sea surface salinity climatology, or ii) calculated based on the prescribed surface freshwater fluxes. In the first run, the sea surface salinity is restored to mean monthly climatology from the Polar Science Center Hydrographic Climatology (PHC). In the second run, the surface salinity restoring is turned off and instead more realistic surface liquid freshwater fluxes from land runoff and precipitation minus evaporation (P-E) fluxes are prescribed from the Coordinated Ice-ocean ",

Can local leaders from historically centralized or ‘conqueror’ groups still influence access to public goods today?

A growing body of literature examining the sources of the current state of African economic development has cited the enduring impacts of precolonial institutions and geography on contemporary African economic development using large sample cross-sectional analysis. In this paper, I focus on within country effects of local ethnic and political state institutions on access to public infrastructure services in present day Nigeria. Specifically, I combine information on the spatial distribution of ethnic states and ecological diversity in Nigeria circa mid 19th century and political states in Nigeria circa 1785 and 1850 with information, from a novel geocoded survey dataset, on access to public infrastructure at the local government level in present day Nigeria to examine the impact of precolonial state centralization on the current unequal access to public infrastructure services in Nigeria, accounting for the effects of ecological diversity and other geographic covariates. Some preliminary results show evidence for the long-term impacts of institutions, geography and ecological diversity on access to public infrastructure in Nigeria.",

In previous studies, the areas used for ISM-onset prediction were often too large (or too small), or did not include all necessary information for the ISM-onset forecasting. Here, we present recent findings that suggest that a climate network approach may help to provide better definitions for areas used for ISM-onset prediction and an overall better ISM-onset prediction. Our analysis focuses on the following domains: North West Pakistan (NP) and the Eastern Ghats (EG) as they have been identified to include important pre-monsoon information for predicting ISM onset dates. Specifically, we focus on the analysis of surface air temperature and relative humidity in both areas that allows us to derive temporal trends and to estimate the ISM onset. We propose an approach, which allows to determine ISM onset in advance in 67% of all considered years. Our proposed approach is less effective during the anomalous years, which are associated with weak/strong monsoons, e.g. El-Nino, La-Nina or positive Indian Ocean Dipole events. ISM onset is predicted for 23 out of 27 normal monsoon years (85%) during the past 6 decades. In addition, we show that time series analysis in both areas during the pre-monsoon period reveals indicators whether the forthcoming ISM will be normal or weaker/stronger.",

            "abstract": "The Duplin River is an ebb-domintated, salt marsh drainage system west of Sapelo Island, Georgia. With no riverine input, flow in the Duplin is dependent on local surface run off, groundwater discharge and tidal flushing. Repeat multibeam bathymetry surveys within this system provide insight into sediment transport, current dynamics, and the migration of bottom features. Examination of bathymetric changes and the rate of bedform migration can be used to help estimate net sediment transport in fluvial and tidal systems. The swath bathymetry data presented here were collected during December 2009, March 2013, and June 2013 (high and low tide) aboard a small survey vessel, using a pole-mounted Kongsberg EM3002d multibeam bathymetry system. Along-stream profiles from bathymetry data collected during a single spring tidal cycle show little bedform migration, while the more temporally distant profiles record significant shifts in both small (cm-scale) and large (m-scale) bedform position, as well as changes in the morphology of large erosional scour depressions. Previous work has suggested the larger bedforms, which maintain an ebb-oriented geometry through both ebb and flood tide, are indicative of sediment transport rates that are an order of magnitude greater during the ebb tide (Zarillo, 1985). The new data suggest punctuated events, such as storm surges, may also play an important role in the fluvial transport, although more analysis is needed to determine how sediment storage changes in the Duplin river system over multiple tidal cycles. Integration of topographic LiDAR data, vegetation patterns, sediment composition, groundwater inputs and planform river morphology will also provide insight into sediment storage and transport within the system.",

            "abstract": "Historical temperature observations from surface stations have been recorded using a variety of units and levels of precision, with metadata that are often incomplete. As a result, the amount of rounding applied to these observations is generally unknown, posing a challenge to statistical methods that are sensitive to the use of discrete data. Methods used to infer distributional changes often assume that data are continuously distributed and can only be reliably applied when the specific discreteness of each sample is known. We present a new technique, termed `precision-decoding,' that identifies the original precision and units of time series data. Applying it to the GHCND database, we identify temporal and spatial patterns in the precision and units used by surface stations. We show that many archived values have been offset from the original observations due to double-rounding in the presence of conversion between Fahrenheit and Celsius, and provide additional metrics to identify stations in need of further quality control. While the discreteness of the data is unlikely to have influenced global mean temperature trends, we show that it can affect higher-order moments of the temperature distribution such as the variance or skewness, and that it can alter the apparent frequency of record-breaking events.",

We show a reasonable match in aerosol optical depth, effective radius, and forcing between the full aerosol implementation and reconstructions/observations of the Mt.

This allows us to investigate not only the climate impact of the injection of volcanic aerosols, but also influences on regional water vapor, O3, and OH distributions.\nWith the skill of the MATRIX volcano implementation established, we explore (1) how the height of the injection column of SO2 influence atmospheric chemistry and climate response, (2) how the initial condition of the atmosphere influences the climate and chemistry impact of the eruption with a particular focus on how ENSO and QBO and (3) how the coupled chemistry could mitigate the climate signal for much larger eruptions (i.e., the 1258 eruption, reconstructed to be ~10x Pinatubo).

            "abstract": "Guanica Bay is an estuary on the southwest coast of Puerto Rico with numerous nearshore reefs located in adjacent coastal waters. As part of the multi-agency Guanica Bay Watershed Project, a study was undertaken to establish baseline levels of terrigenous sedimentation reaching reefs adjacent to the Guanica Bay watershed as well as establish spatial and temporal patterns in its delivery. To characterize and quantify sedimentation patterns, sediment traps were established at nine reef sites occurring along an ~ 14 km stretch of coastline centered on the outlet of the bay. Sites were located at shallow reefs within 2 km of the shore at depths of ~ 10 m. Two additional sites were located at the mouth of the Rio Loco where it empties into Guanica Bay and at the mouth of the bay where it opens into adjacent coastal waters. Traps were collected monthly from August 2009 through July 2012 to determine both the amount of sediment accumulation (mg cm-2 day-1) and its composition. Composition is expressed in terms of relative amounts of calcium carbonate (in situ production), organic material and terrigenous material. Average trap accumulation rates among the reef sites ranged from ~ 3 to 28 mg cm-2 day-1. Average percent terrigenous material within reef accumulation ranged from ~ 20% to 30%. While trap accumulation rates are highly variable on both spatial and temporal scales, the composition of sediments and relative amount of terrigenous material is fairly uniform. Similar temporal patterns in accumulation rates among the sites without corresponding changes in composition of sediments point to resuspension of bottom sediments by wave action as a primary driver of sedimentary dynamics at these reefs. Sites closest to Guanica Bay display the highest degree of terrigenous influence in terms of trap accumulation rates and percent terrigenous material, which is consistent with Guanica Bay serving as a local source of terrigenous material to coastal waters. However, the lack of east-west trends relative to the bay mouth in either trap accumulation rates or percent terrigenous material indicates that Guanica Bay is not the sole or necessarily primary source of terrigenous materials reaching nearshore reefs.",

The surface quantitative precipitation (QPE) may have considerable errors if vertical structure of precipitation is not considered. It has been realized that the vertical profile of reflectivity (VPR) information is very useful for accurately estimating the surface rainfall. Researchers at the University of Oklahoma have incorporated VPR information from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar (PR) to the Multi-Radar Multi- Sensor system. In the latest progress in the VPR-Identification and Enhancement (VPR-IE) approach, we have optimally combined the climatological VPR information with real-time TRMM-PR observation. Performance of latest hybrid VPR-IE is comprehensively evaluated for the Mountainous West Region of the U.S. Results indicate greater improvements in precipitation estimation following the hybrid VPR-IE methods compared to pure climatological VPR corrections. With the recent availability of GPM Dual-frequency PR, the VPR-IE approach is anticipated to be more robust and more useful by extending to higher latitude mountainous regions.",

            "abstract": "China is the largest emitter of anthropogenic air pollution in the world and previous work has shown the environmental impacts of the long-range transport (LRT) of air pollution from China to the U.S. via chemical transport models, in situ observations, isentropic back trajectories, and to a lesser extent statistical models. However, these studies generally focus on a narrow time period due to data constraints. In this study, we build upon the literature using econometric techniques to isolate the impacts on U.S. air quality from the LRT of air pollution from China. We use a unique daily data set of China's air pollution index (API) and PM10 concentrations at the city level and merge these information with daily monitor data in California (CA) between 2000 and 2013. We first employ a distributed lag model to examine daily patterns, and then exploit a \"natural experiment.\" In the latter methodology, since air pollution is rarely randomly assigned, we examine the impacts of specific events that affect air quality in China, but are plausibly uncorrelated to factors affecting air pollution in CA. For example, Chinese New Year (CNY) is a major week-long holiday and we show pollution levels in China decrease during this time period, likely from reductions in industrial production. CNY varies each calendar year since it is based off the lunar new year, so the timing of this pollution reduction could be considered \"as good as random\" or exogenous to factors affecting air quality in CA. Using a regression framework including weather, seasonal and geographic controls, we can potentially isolate the impact of the LRT of air pollution to CA. First, results from the distributed lag model suggest that in the Spring, when LRT peaks, a 1 μg/m3 increase in daily PM10 from China between 10 and 14 days ago is associated with an increase in today's PM2.5 in CA of 0.022 μg/m3 (mean daily PM2.5 in CA is 12 μg/m3). Second, we find that if CNY occurred 5 to 9 days ago, today's PM2.5 in CA decreases by 3 μg/m3. We also conduct other tests and sensitivity checks, like observing impacts from individual cities in China or other events, and using daily leads as a falsification test. Our results have important policy implications regarding the consequences of foreign pollution sources and suggest a causal relationship between pollution from China and air quality in CA.",

While simple statistics can be applied to compare models with observations, advanced data mining methods, like unsupervised cluster analysis, offer powerful tools for summarizing model-data differences in the spatial and temporal patterns of ecological characteristics. We compared modeled land surface phenology with MODIS 16-day composited Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (MOD13C1) and Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) NDVI3g products spanning years 2001 to 2012. Annual traces of NDVI from two ESMs (CESM-CLM and ISAM) were calculated using modeled radiation from the output of historical simulations and corrected to better match observed properties by considering instrumental bandwidths and solar angle. Multivariate Spatio-Temporal Clustering (MSTC) was applied to annual traces of MODIS and GIMMS NDVI to create phenological regions (phenoregions) and analyzed using Mapcurves, a tool designed for comparing categorical maps, to check the consistency of the spatial patterns of observations before assessing model output. To evaluate modeled phenology, MSTC was first applied to obtain representative centroids of modeled NDVI and separately of satellite NDVI. The Mapcurves method was applied to compare the spatial patterns of modeled phenology to remote sensing observations. Next, modeled NDVI were projected onto the centroids defining phenoregions of observed NDVI, and observed NDVI were projected onto the centroids of modeled NDVI. Mapcurves was then applied to compare the spatial patterns of these classifications. Results showed a general agreement in the spatial pattern of phenoregions from models to satellite observations, except in high-latitude regions and agricultural areas. MSTC averages out small deviations between modeled and observed phenology, which are exhibited across all biome types. However, Mapcurves results showed a relatively low goodness of fit score for modeled phenology projected onto observations. This study demonstrates the utility of a data mining approach for cross-validation of observations and evaluation of model performance.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying anthropogenic sources of CO2 is imperative yet challenging. Here, we present data assimilation experiments to assess the information gain in using current satellite observations of atmospheric constituents that are co-­emitted during a combustion process. In particular, OSSEs will be conducted to investigate synergistic information from GOSAT (and OCO-2) CO2, MOPITT (and IASI) CO and OMI NO2 retrievals in constraining sources of anthropogenic combustion at city, state, and regional spatiotemporal scales. These experiments will be carried out using ensemble-­‐based data assimilation (DA) system comprising of a regional air quality/weather model, WRF-­Chem, global climate/chemistry model, CAM-Chem, and a data assimilation software package, DART. The ensemble-based DA system, which mimics a numerical weather prediction with chemistry, provides a means to statistically estimate local sensitivities across modeled meteorological and chemical states (CO2, CO, NO2, and related species) and parameters (including surface fluxes) using the ensemble statistics derived from dynamical, physical, and chemical perturbations in the model. We take advantage of these sensitivities in fully exploiting the synergistic information provided by the enhancement ratios that are indicative of combustion characteristic for a given location sampled by these space-­based observations. Here, we introduce a two-­step approach in optimizing anthropogenic CO2. This includes: 1) analysis of atmospheric CO2 distribution using multi-­‐species DA, and 2) Bayesian synthesis time-independent inversion using the CO2 analysis as observational constraints. We evaluate the performance of this approach within an OSSE framework, where one realization of simulated atmosphere is assumed to be the ‘truth’. Synthetic observations are then derived from this atmosphere using sampling and error characteristics of the retrievals. The assimilation of these synthetic observations will be evaluated based on how well the analysis reproduce the ‘true’ anthropogenic CO2. Initial results will be presented comparing the relative contributions of different satellite retrievals in constraining anthropogenic CO2. We will also discuss appropriate sampling characteristics to this effect.",

            "abstract": "The Southern Ocean is one of the earth’s largest regional net carbon sinks due to strong westerly winds, which drive surface gas exchange, deep mixing and upwelling. The strength of the sink is set by complex interactions between the physical circulation, gas exchange and biological activity in surface waters. Recent work by others has predicted that global warming may weaken the sink by strengthening the regional winds, increasing upwelling and the flux of deep, naturally carbon-rich and radiocarbon-depleted water into the surface mixed layer. The resulting decrease in the air-sea pCO2 gradient is thought to overwhelm other compensating changes, causing a weakened net sink. Here we demonstrate the use of precise measurements of radiocarbon in Drake Passage air (14CO2) to detect short-term fluctuations in the Southern Ocean gross sea-to-air C flux, and by extension, possible changes in the net carbon sink and their underlying causes.\nDrake Passage boundary layer air has been sampled since 2006 at roughly fortnightly intervals as part of NOAA’s Cooperative Air Sampling Network, resulting in a 5-year high-resolution 14CO2 time-series with accompanying same-flask CO2 concentration measurements. Atmospheric measurements at Drake Passage are representative of zonal average exchange fluxes due to strong mixing by the westerly winds. In preliminary results, anomalously low ∆14C values are correlated with positive states of the Southern Annular Mode, a hemispheric-scale indicator of stronger westerly winds in the high latitude Southern Ocean. Simulations from the TM5 atmospheric transport model with a detailed global radiocarbon budget are used to interpret the results. These results appear to support the hypothesized link between stronger westerly winds and a weaker Southern Ocean carbon sink.",

            "abstract": "The behaviour of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) over the past millennium has been subject to much debate. A period of particular interest is the Little Ice Age (LIA; AD ~1400-1850), which was punctuated by anomalously cold temperatures at least in the Northern Hemisphere. However, there is still dispute over the dominant state of the climate over this period. Climate proxies such as corals, sediment cores and tree rings have been used to extend ENSO reconstructions prior to the instrumental period. Previously published work suggests that there is a discrepancy in the interpretation of precipitation-based and temperature-based ENSO proxies. While several precipitation proxies suggest a more La Nina-like state during the LIA, temperature proxies suggest the opposite. However, this conclusion is largely based on individual records or a combination of just a few.\nWe show that this apparent disagreement between temperature and precipitation trends over the last millennium can be resolved by the use of an improved, denser proxy network. Two ENSO reconstructions, derived from temperature proxies and from rainfall proxies, are constructed using an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) based method, which is validated using PMIP3 model data. Over the LIA period, the proxy reconstructions display a correlation of 0.55, both tending to a La Nina-like state. This result is corroborated by the model reconstructions, which show high correlations between temperature and rainfall both when using the entire tropical region and when using only data at real proxy locations.\nOne of the main remaining issues for improving ENSO reconstructions is the lack of tropical proxy records, particularly for temperature. Although the reconstructions here include nearly, if not all, available proxy records, the temperature series is still based on less than 10 records. In order to further strengthen our understanding of ENSO, an effort must be made to collect more data.",

The peridotites vary from coarse-grained, clinopyroxene-poor spinel peridotite to fine-grained, recrystallized, clinopyroxene-rich garnet peridotite. Garnet coronas around spinel and garnet exsolution indicate cooling and/or increasing pressure. Previous thermobarometry (Chin et al., 2012) interpreted these peridotites as originally shallow (<3 GPa), melt-depleted residues that were subsequently refertilized by basaltic melt, transported to final pressures ~3 GPa, and cooled to 650 – 845 C. Here, we investigate deformation microstructures and volatile content of Sierran peridotites. Owing to the dependence of olivine lattice preferred orientation (LPO) on stress, temperature, and water content, we can gain new constraints on the relative chronology of deformation and introduction of volatiles, which may be related to the refertilization event. Olivine LPOs were determined using the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) technique with the HKL Channel 5 software. Measurements were done manually on a grain-by-grain basis along 3 mm-spacing profiles parallel to the long axis of each thin section. We analyzed three garnet peridotites and one mylonitic spinel peridotite. Of the garnet peridotites, one sample shows alignment of [001] parallel to lineation with [010] aligned normal to the foliation (B-type fabric), while the other samples display a girdle distribution of [100] and [001] parallel to lineation (possibly suggesting axial compression). The mylonitic spinel peridotite is also characterized by a B-type fabric. The B-type fabric is associated with low temperatures, high stress, and hydrous conditions, and could be the dominant fabric type in the cold part of the mantle wedge. The presence of B-type fabric in the Sierran peridotites is consistent with their equilibration at cold temperatures and high pressures, conditions that could be associated with refrigeration by the Farallon slab. We are currently obtaining water and fluorine concentrations in olivine, pyroxenes, and garnet in the Sierran peridotites. These data will be presented at the meeting.",

In cities and urban areas, the inflows and outflows associated with virtual water flows are rarely acknowledged. The emphasis is on the physical and engineered water balances. Our aim is to show the need to account for virtual flows in population-dense regions to better inform local water decision makers. We compare and contrast current methods to assess virtual water. Specifically, we examine the Water Footprint Network method, life cycle assessment, multi-regional input-output method and embedded resource accounting. We build upon these approaches and suggest a framework to account for virtual flows in US cities in the context of constrained available datasets. Results highlight the potential for making estimates of virtual flows in cities more routine and address how this could fit within an urban metabolism framework. We discuss how this framework can assist decision makers as we move into a new era of understanding the role of cities in the context of water scarcity.",

            "abstract": "Field measurements of the vertical structure of rip current flows inside and outside the surf zone are examined on a rip-channeled beach at Monterey, California. Wave-group induced very low frequency (VLF) motions were a significant component of the rip current flow, accounting for 37% to 50% of the total energy inside and outside the surf zone. The VLF pulsations in the near-surface rip current flow were aperiodic, with more frequent and stronger pulsations occurring for increased wave energy. The VLF pulses measured inside and outside the surf zone did not occur simultaneously and were not correlated, indicating the VLF rip current pulses outside the surf zone were random and independent of those inside the surf zone. The strength of the VLF pulses added to the mean surfzone background rip current flow, and determined the magnitude of the rip current flow outside the surf zone where there was no background flow. Inside the surf zone, the rip current flow was found to be depth-uniform with minimal rotation throughout the water column. Outside the surf zone the rip current flow was surface-dominated with rotation in the flow with depth. The results suggest that the rip current behaves like a jet as it exits the surf zone and moves over the surfzone break, becoming surface dominated outside the surf zone and remaining between the sea-surface and the depth at the offshore edge of the surf zone. Farther offshore, the rip current flow mixes vertically downward controlled by the depth of the thermocline as it continues to be transported and mixed offshore.",

            "abstract": "Forest inventories play an essential role in carbon monitoring and REDD+, however they provide a sparse picture of the carbon cycle at a regional scale. Terrestrial Biosphere Models (TBMs) provide a complete picture of the carbon cycle, but efforts at combining inventory data with models have focused primarily on model calibration and purely model-based regional-scale carbon estimation, which ignore observed disturbances, management, and spatiotemporal variability in forest. Our approach is based on assimilating inventory observations in a size- and age-structured model, the Ecosystem Demography model (ED2). Assumptions of large homogenous areas in ecological models result in loss of details that hinder incorporation of observations. We address how to assimilate inventory data with model predictions in a practical way that is readily extensible to the simultaneous fusion of remote sensing and eddy covariance along with inventories.\nWe updated ED2 predictions on forest growth with Forest Inventory and Analysis program (FIA) data. Data assimilation method was the Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF) as implemented in Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) workflow. The study area is a 1° by 1° grid with the Willow Creek Ameriflux tower in Wisconsin at center. ED2 groups individual trees in cohorts so it captures the landscape-scale heterogeneity. Although this approach speeds up computations, it is not practical to estimate each FIA plot within a chosen area. We classified and averaged data for different plots according to their biomass based on number and size of trees within a plot, focusing on biomass changes over a measurement period. We separately calculated the average diameter at breast height (dbh) and stem density for plants over 5 cm for measured and modeled plots within a biomass class for different Plant Functional Types (PFTs).\nThe results showed EAKF successfully adjusting the predicted changes in biomass according to observations. Variation in stem density and dbh within the same biomass class was low for plots with mid to high biomass and thus the state estimates fit better with all observed values within that biomass class, while plots with low biomass show high variation. Therefore applying a single correction factor for all plots did not match the updated plots with the observed plots.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies show that isotropic seismic imaging based on adjoint method reduces low-frequency artifact caused by diving waves, which commonly occur in two-wave wave-equation migration, such as Reverse Time Migration (RTM). Here, we derive new expressions of sensitivity kernels for Vertical Transverse Isotropy (VTI) using the Thomsen parameters (ε, δ, γ) plus the P-, and S-wave speeds (α, β) as well as via the Chen & Tromp (GJI 2005) parameters (A, C, N, L, F). For Horizontal Transverse Isotropy (HTI), these parameters depend on an azimuthal angle φ, where the tilt angle θ is equivalent to 90°, and for Tilted Transverse Isotropy (TTI), these parameters depend on both the azimuth and tilt angles. We calculate sensitivity kernels for each of these two approaches. Individual kernels (“images”) are numerically constructed based on the interaction between the regular and adjoint wavefields in smoothed models which are in practice estimated through Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI). The final image is obtained as a result of summing all shots, which are well distributed to sample the target model properly. The impedance kernel, which is a sum of sensitivity kernels of density and the Thomsen or Chen & Tromp parameters, looks crisp and promising for seismic imaging. The other kernels suffer from low-frequency artifacts, similar to traditional seismic imaging conditions. However, all sensitivity kernels are important for estimating the gradient of the misfit function, which, in combination with a standard gradient-based inversion algorithm, is used to minimize the objective function in FWI.",

            "abstract": "The Texas-northern Mexico high plains experienced record drought conditions in 2011 during strong negative phases of ENSO and the NAO. Given predictions of increased frequency and severity of drought under projected climate change [e.g., Reichstein et al., 2013] and recent findings of CO2 growth rate sensitivity to interannual variability of carbon uptake in semi-arid ecosystems [Poulter et al., 2014], we investigate the response of carbon uptake in the Texas high plains to interannual climate variability with the goal of improved mechanistic understanding of climate-carbon cycle links. Specifically, we examine (1) observed tendencies in regional scale carbon uptake and soil moisture from 2010 to 2011 using satellite observations of gross primary production (GPP) (from plant fluorescence) from GOSAT and soil moisture from SMOS, and (2) the interannual relationship between GPP and ENSO & NAO variability using terrestrial biosphere simulations from 1950-2012.\nObservations reveal widespread decline of GPP in 2011 (0.42 +/- 0.04 Pg C yr-1) correlated with negative soil moisture tendencies (r = 0.85 +/- 0.21) which leads to corresponding declines in net carbon uptake and transpiration (according to model simulations). Further examination of model results over the period 1950-2012 indicates that negative GPP anomalies are linked systematically to winter and spring precipitation deficits associated with overlapping negative phases of winter NAO and ENSO, with increasing magnitude of negative anomalies in strong La Niña years. Furthermore, the strongest decline of GPP, carbon uptake, and transpiration on record occurred during the 2011 drought and were associated with extreme negative phases of ENSO and NAO, with 2011 being the only year since 1950 that both indices exceeded 1 σ standard deviation.",

            "abstract": "The development of large-scale carbon dioxide reduction projects requires high purity CO2and a reactive cation source. A project seeking to provide both of these requirements will likely face cost barriers with current carbon prices. The cement industry is a suitable early implementation site for such projects by virtue of the properties of its exhaust gases and those of waste concrete.\nCement plants are the second largest source of industrial CO2 emissions, globally. It is also the second largest commodity after water, has no ready substitute and is literally the foundation of society. Finally, half of the CO2 emissions originate from process reactions rather than fossil fuel combustion resulting in higher flue gas CO2concentrations. These properties, with the co-benefits of oxygen combustion, create a favorable environment for spatially suitable projects.\nOxygen combustion involves substituting produced oxygen for air in a combustion reaction. The absence of gaseous N2 necessitates the recirculation of exhaust gases to maintain kiln temperatures, which increase the CO2 concentrations from 28% to 80% or more. Gas exit temperatures are also elevated (>300oC) and can reach higher temperatures if the multi stage pre-heater towers, that recover heat, are re-designed in light of FGR.\nA ready source of cations can be found in waste concrete, a by-product of construction and demolition activities. These wastes can be processed to remove cations and then reacted with atmospheric CO2 to produce carbonate minerals. While not carbon negative, they represent a demonstration opportunity for binding atmospheric CO2while producing a saleable product (precipitated calcium carbonate).\nThis paper will present experimental results on PCC production from waste concrete along with modeling results for oxygen combustion at cement facilities. The results will be presented with a view to mineral sequestration process design and implementation.",

However, recent research has suggested that TCs may play a significant role in atmospheric meridional heat transport given the strong correlation between aggregate TC activity and meridional heat transport during the following winter. Building upon prior research, the present study seeks to advance our understanding of the potential role of TCs in aggregate transport of atmospheric energy by quantifying whether the upper-tropospheric outflow of TCs is responsible for transporting significant quantities of total energy (i.e., sum of kinetic energy, latent energy, potential energy, and sensible heat) in the upper troposphere from the Northern Hemisphere (NH) tropics into the Southern Hemisphere tropics during the peak of NH TC season (i.e., late summer and early fall).\nStorm-relative composites of western North Pacific TCs reveal that the upper-tropospheric outflow jet of the TC is responsible for significant southward total energy transport at the equator primarily in the form of dry static energy (i.e., sum of potential energy and sensible heat). Zonal integration of the meridional total energy transport anomalies over a global domain suggests that the TC is the dominant contributing factor at the equator, resulting in instantaneous southward energy transport anomalies of −0.5 PW. For comparison, time-averaged climatological meridional energy transport is approximately −1.0 to −2.0 PW at the equator during the peak of NH TC season, suggesting that TCs temporarily enhance climatological southward energy transport at the equator.",

This study represents a semi-analytical transient solution for estimating leakage rate by pressure change evaluation through an abandoned non-penetrating well (ANW) coupled with an injection well. The leakage rate can be estimated using the Darcy’s law by evaluating pressure change between the upper and the lower aquifers through ANW. The analysis was conducted by solving the diffusivity equations of fluid flow in the aquifer coupled with the pipe flow through ANW. The single-phase flow is considered in this study that is capable of explaining both fluid and CO2 plume flow in an aquifer system by neglecting the variable density effect. The result is compared with that of Avci’s (1994) which dealt with an abandoned fully penetrating well. The result indicates the similar type of curve trend, which is observed by applying a range of aquifer properties as well as distance between the injection and leakage pathway. The important finding is that the leakage rate through ANW is about 50% compared to the fully penetrating well of Avci’s (1994). The sensitivity analyses indicate that parameter leakage coefficient (A), transmissivity ratio (TD) and radial distance (R) between injection and ANW are the most sensitive to the leakage rate and the rest of the parameters are less sensitive. Because of availability of limited analytical and complex numerical solution, this simple new approach is going to provide a simple means to estimate leakage flow for realistic field condition.",

            "abstract": "To interpret the geodynamic processes of the Tibetan plateau uplift, several mechanisms have been proposed, such as the rigid block extrusion or mid-lower crustal flow model. Recently the presences of mid-lower crustal ductile zones (exhibited as low velocity zones) were detected by various geophysical methods in SE Tibet. However, because of the relatively low spatial resolution of previous studies, the detailed variations of crustal structure as well as the relations between surface faults and ductile zones are poorly understood. Here, we utilized broadband waveform data recorded by a newly deployed dense seismic array (ChinaArray) in SE Tibet. We produced high-resolution images of crustal structure along two profiles by common-conversion-point (CCP) stacking from 4566 Ps receiver functions. The most conspicuous features are as follows: (1) the Moho depth changes abruptly across the Red-River fault (~10 km offset from ~38 to 48 km) and also the Lijiang-Xiaojinhe fault (~13 km offset from ~64 to ~51 km); (2) The low velocity zones are only visible beneath the Chuandian block, which are bounded by the Red-River fault and the Xiaojiang fault. These two faults may restrict the lateral extensions of the low velocity zones; (3) Discontinuous low velocity zones are observed beneath the Qiangtang block and the Yangtze craton respectively. As a suture zone between the Qiangtang block and the Yangtze craton, the Lijiang-Xiaojinhe fault may cut through the whole crust. We propose that the southeastward extrusion of the Qiangtang block is resisted by the Yangtze craton beneath Lijiang-Xiaojinhe fault.",

The production of actionable science is thus urgently needed to inform and prepare the public for the consequences of climate change for local and global food systems. Access to data that spans multiple sectors/domains and spatial and temporal scales is key to beginning to tackle such complex issues.\nAs part of the White House’s Climate Data Initiative, the USDA and the National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) are launching a new collaboration to catalyze data-driven research to enhance food systems resilience to climate change. To support this collaboration, SESYNC is developing a new “Data to Motivate Synthesis” program designed to engage early career scholars in a highly interactive and dynamic process of real-time data discovery, analysis, and visualization to catalyze new research questions and analyses that would not have otherwise been possible and/or apparent. This program will be supported by an integrated, spatially-enabled cyberinfrastructure that enables the management, intersection, and analysis of large heterogeneous datasets relevant to food systems resilience to climate change. Our approach is to create a series of geospatial abstraction data structures and visualization services that can be used to accelerate analysis and visualization across various socio-economic and environmental datasets (e.g., reconcile census data with remote sensing raster datasets). We describe the application of this approach with a pilot workshop of socio-environmental scholars that will lay the groundwork for the larger SESYNC-USDA collaboration. We discuss the particular challenges of supporting an integrated, repeatable workflow for socio-environmental data synthesis, and the advantages and limitations to using data as a launching point for interdisciplinary research projects.",

            "abstract": "The eruption of the Siberian Traps Large Igneous Province (LIP) was synchronous with the largest known mass extinction, at the Permo-Triassic boundary. Understanding the volatile budget of the eruptions and hence their potential effects on climate is of critical importance. The volcanism spanned an enormous territory (5 million km2) over 0.8 Ma and the magmas feeding the eruptions were heterogeneous in their chemistry in space and time. In terms of volatiles in pre-eruptive magmas, there are multiple possible sources: the mantle (including metasomatized lithosphere) and crustal rocks and sediments. Discriminating between these sources requires not only microanalysis of volatiles in melt inclusions, but also analysis of trace elements. Crucially, the magmas sampled for this study did not intersect and assimilate evaporite deposits or brines prior to emplacement as sills or eruption as lavas, in contrast to previous studies, which might allow mantle-derived volatile heterogeneity to be preserved in the melts. We present a new dataset of clinopyroxene-hosted melt inclusion geochemistry. Crystalline inclusions in clinopyroxene with Mg# from 69.2 to 82.6 were homogenized at temperatures of 1190°C and fO2 of FMQ-1 in a high temperature gas mixing furnace. We show that, for this particular suite of lavas, considerable variability exists in trace and volatile element ratios (e.g. La/Yb, Nb/Y, Ba/La, F/Nd, Cl/K) that may be explained entirely by mantle heterogeneity. The most depleted melts (e.g. low La/Yb) have the highest range and values of S/Dy, Cl/K and F/Nd ratios; and the most “enriched” melts (highest La/Yb) exhibit low volatile/trace element ratios. These trends are consistent with mixing between end member sources: low degrees of melting of a volatile-poor source and high degrees of melting of a volatile-rich component with a depleted trace element signature (which might be consistent with minimally devolatilised recycled oceanic crust). There is no clear evidence of continental crust being assimilated and promoting additional volatile enrichment.",

            "abstract": "We use ERA-Interim and CERES data to calculate the energy budget of the tropical atmosphere as a function of sea surface temperature. We emphasize the role of the atmospheric cloud radiative effect (ACRE; the change in the radiative heating rate of the atmosphere due to the presence of clouds), which causes a heating of the atmosphere by trapping radiation that would otherwise be lost to space, and which then increases the requirement for the atmosphere to export energy from convective regions. Over the warm pool (10 S – 10 N, 150 – 180 E), the ACRE is shown to be roughly half the value of the net energy transport (~40 W/m2 ACRE from CERES data compared to ~70 W/m2 net energy transport calculated from ERA-Interim). Additionally, we show that over areas of warm SSTs (> 300 K), both ACRE and the energy transport increase with increasing sea surface temperature (SST). The increase in ACRE mirrors the increase in energy transport, suggesting that the increase in energy transport over warmer SSTs is largely driven by radiative heating from the clouds. The net cloud radiative effect at the top of the atmosphere is remarkably insensitive to SST, however.",

            "abstract": "Models that faithfully represent spatially-integrated hydrologic transport through the critical zone at sub-watershed scales are essential building blocks for large-scale models of land use and climate controls on non-point source contaminant delivery. A particular challenge facing these models is the need to represent the delay between inputs of soluble contaminants (such as nitrate) at the field scale, and the solute load that appears in streams. Recent advances in the theory of time-variable transit time distributions (e.g. Botter et al., GRL 38(L11403), 2011) have provided a rigorous framework for representing conservative solute transport and its coupling to hydrologic variability and partitioning.\nHere I will present a reformulation of this framework that offers several distinct advantages over existing formulations: 1) the derivation of the governing conservation equation is simple and intuitive, 2) the closure relations are expressed in a convenient and physically meaningful way as probability distributions\nΩ(\nS\nT\n)\nover the storage ranked by age\nS\nT\n, and 3) changes in transport behavior determined by storage-dependent dilution and flow-path dynamics (as distinct from those due only to changes in the rates and partitioning of water flux) are completely encapsulated by these probability distributions.\nThe framework has been implemented to model to the rich dataset of long-term stream and precipitation chloride from the Plynlimon watershed in Wales, UK. With suitable choices for the functional form of the closure relationships, only a small number of free parameters are required to reproduce the observed chloride dynamics as well as previous models with many more parameters, including reproducing the observed fractal 1/f filtering of the streamflow chloride variability. The modeled transport dynamics are sensitive to the input precipitation variability and water balance partitioning to evapotranspiration. Apparent storage-dependent age-sampling suggests that the model can account for shifts in flow pathways across high and low flows. This approach suggests a path forward for catchment-scale coupled flow and transport modeling.",

            "abstract": "Conversion from grassland to woody dominated communities has been observed globally. In recent decades, this pattern has been observed in coastal communities along the mid-Atlantic U.S. In coastal environments, a suite of biotic and abiotic factors interact as filters to determine plant community structure and distribution. Microclimatic conditions: soil and air temperature, soil moisture and salinity, and light attenuation under grass cover were measured across a grassland-woody encroachment gradient on a Virginia barrier island; to identify the primary factors that mediate this change. Woody establishment was associated with moderately dense (2200 shoots/m2) grass cover, but reduced at high (> 6200 shoots/ m2) and low (< 1250 shoots/ m2) densities. Moderately dense grass cover reduced light attenuation (82.50 % reduction) to sufficiently reduce soil temperature thereby limiting soil moisture evaporation. However, high grass density reduced light attenuation (98.7 % reduction) enough to inhibit establishment of woody species; whereas low grass density attenuated much less light (48.7 % reduction) which allowed for greater soil moisture evaporation. Soil salinity was dynamic as rainfall, tidal inundation, and sea spray produce spatiotemporal variation throughout the barrier island landscape. The importance of light and temperature were compounded as they also indirectly affect soil salinity via their affects on soil moisture. Determining how these biotic and abiotic factors relate to sea level rise and climate change will improve understanding coastal community response as global changes proceed. Understanding how community shifts affect ecosystem function and their potential to affect adjacent systems will also improve predictive ability of coastal ecosystem responses.",

After five million calibrated images, it is appropriate to examine NOAA data as providing consistent context for scientific missions. The first GOES Solar X-ray Imager was launched in 2001 and entered operations in 2003. The current SXIs will remain in operations until approximately 2020, when a new series of Solar (extreme-) Ultraviolet Imagers (SUVIs) will replace them as the current satellites reach their end of life. In the sense that the SXIs are similar to Yokoh’s SXT and Hinode’s XRT, the SUVI instruments will be similar to SOHO’s EIT and SDO’s AIA. The move to narrowband EUV imagers will better support eventual operational estimation of plasma conditions. This work examines the record of GOES Solar X-ray Imager (SXI) observations, including continuity, photometric stability, navigation accuracy, and comparison to other contemporary X-ray imagers. Initial examination of the observing record shows nearly complete coverage since 2001 with the exception of gaps in 2002 and 2008-9. During that span, there are overlaps between all the NOAA instruments to facilitate photometric inter-calibration. Preliminary results of inter-calibration show mostly linear relationships between instruments with exceptions awaiting further investigation. Pointing (navigation) knowledge for the SXIs (particularly GOES 13-15 instruments) will be improved allowing for easier integration of SXI observations into scientific studies. While NOAA’s principal use of these observations is real-time space weather forecasting, they will continue to provide a consistent context measurement for researchers for decades to come.",

One of the key goals in aquatic ecosystem ecology is to parse the upstream influences of terrestrial and aquatic processes on local conditions, which becomes progressively more difficult as watershed size increases and as processes are altered by diverse human activities. Simultaneous deployments of high frequency, in situ aquatic sensors for multiple constituents (e.g. NO3-N, CDOM, turbidity, conductivity, D.O., water temperature, along with flow) offer a new approach for understanding patterns along the aquatic continuum. For this talk, we explore strategies for deployments within single watersheds to improve understanding of terrestrial and aquatic processes. We address applications regarding mobilization of non-point nutrient sources across temporal scales, interactions with land use and watershed size, and the importance of aquatic processes. We also explore ways in which simultaneous sensor deployments can be designed to improve parameterization and testing of river network biogeochemical models. We will provide several specific examples using conductivity, nitrate and carbon from ongoing sensor deployments in New England, USA. We expect that improved deployments of sensors and sensor networks will benefit the management of critical freshwater resources.",

To reliably model natural phenomena and interpret observational data, the accurate determination of underlying collision processes (cross sections, dissociation dynamics) through fundamental experimental studies is essential.\nThe detection of metastable species in laboratory experiments requires a novel approach. Typical radiative de-excitation detection techniques cannot be performed due to the long-lived nature of excited species, and conventional particle detectors are insensitive to the low internal energies O(<sup>1</sup><i>S</i>) and O(<sup>1</sup><i>D</i>).

            "abstract": "The Toba super eruption, which occurred at MIS 5a-4 transition in northern Sumatra, is considered as the word largest known explosive volcanic eruption. Ash preserved in marine and terrestrial sediments shows that the dispersal of the Younger Toba Tuff (YTT) extended to 140S in the southern hemisphere, westward as far as 640E, and northeastwards ~1800 km into the South China Sea. The impact of this explosive event on the global and regional climate and the environment in general remains speculative based on models. Our study was undertaken to directly evaluate changes occurred in climate and environment after the eruption.\nThe YTT layer bearing, top two sections of NGHP 19B 2H sediment core, collected from northern Bay of Bengal, was studied to understand the impacts,. Approximate sedimentation rate of the site during the period was 10 cmkyr-1, Diffuse color reflectance (DSR) spectra, chemical composition of the bulk sediment (XRF), Mg/Ca and δ18O of Globigerinoides ruber were measured at 0.5-2 cm resolutions. Down core variability in Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca ratios and a* and b* color coordinates of sediments, which are proxies for terrestrial input vs productivity, together with SST, calculated with Mg/Ca and δ18O corrected for temperature and ice volume (δ18Osw), suggest climate and environmental changes occurred.\nSince the Toba event occurred at the beginning of MIS 4 glacial period, only the deviations from the cooling related trend in the proxy records were taken in to account. Decrease in Ti/Ca and Fe/Ca ratios by about 25% after the event indicates either decrease in terrestrial influx due to decrease in precipitation or increased productivity leading to enhanced Ca burial or both. Decreased a* and b* (about 12%) indicates shifting sediment color towards blue and green indicating higher productivity. However, 0.5°C decrease of SST derived from Mg/Ca of G. ruber and about 0.34 (‰) increase of δ18Osw, which indicates saltier conditions, are within the error margins. Therefore, it is reasonable to interpret that there was a short-lived increase in productivity due to increase in nutrient supply. A decrease in rainfall intensity could also be plausible. Future work will test the reaction of the continental ecosystem to the Toba eruption.",

            "abstract": "Multiple driving mechanisms conspire to increase melt extent and extreme melt events frequency in the Arctic: changing heat transport, shortwave radiation (SW), and longwave radiation (LW). Cloud Radiative Forcing (CRF) of Greenland's surface is amplified by a dry atmosphere and by albedo feedback, making its contribution to surface melt even more variable in time and space. Unfortunately accurate cloud observations and thus CRF estimates are hindered by Greenland's remoteness, harsh conditions, and low contrast between surface and cloud reflectance. In this study, cloud observations from satellites and reanalyses are ingested into and evaluated within a column radiative transfer model. An improved CRF dataset is obtained by correcting systematic discrepancies derived from sensitivity experiments.\nFirst, we compare the surface radiation budgets from the Column Radiation Model (CRM) driven by different cloud datasets, with surface observations from Greenland Climate Network (GC-Net). In clear skies, CRM-estimated surface radiation driven by water vapor profiles from both AIRS and MODIS during May-Sept 2010-2012 are similar, stable, and reliable. For example, although AIRS water vapor path exceeds MODIS by 1.4 kg/m2 on a daily average, the overall absolute difference in downwelling SW is < 4 W/m2. CRM estimates are within 20 W/m2 range of GC-Net downwelling SW.\nAfter calibrating CRM in clear skies, the remaining differences between CRM and observed surface radiation are primarily attributable to differences in cloud observations. We estimate CRF using cloud products from MODIS and from MERRA. The SW radiative forcing of thin clouds is mainly controlled by cloud water path (CWP). As CWP increases from near 0 to 200 g/m2, the net surface SW drops from over 100 W/m2 to 30 W/m2 almost linearly, beyond which it becomes relatively insensitive to CWP. The LW is dominated by cloud height. For clouds at all altitudes, the lower the clouds, the greater the LW forcing. By applying systematic tuning to minimize discrepancies between the CRM and observations, we construct an improved CRF dataset. According to our preliminary results, tuning CWP alone improves the SW CRF by over 20 W/m2. With this CRF, studies on how much clouds contribute to Greenland surface melt in the long-term and in extreme melt years can be better quantified.",

            "abstract": "Changes in arctic tundra vegetation have the potential to alter the regional carbon (C) budget, with feedback implications for global climate. A number of studies have documented both widespread increases in productivity as well as shifts in the dominant vegetation. In particular, shrubs have been replacing other vegetation, such as graminoids, in response to changes in their environment. Shrub expansion is thought to be facilitated by exposure of mineral soil and increased nutrient availability, which are often associated with disturbance. Such disturbances can be naturally occurring, typically associated with permafrost degradation or with direct anthropogenic causes such as infrastructure development. Mechanical disturbance associated with human development is not uncommon in tundra and will likely become more frequent as warming makes the Arctic more hospitable for resource extraction and other human activities. As such, this type of disturbance will become an increasingly important component of tundra C balance. Both increased productivity and shrub expansion have clear impacts on ecosystem C cycling through increased C uptake and aboveground (AG) storage. What is less clear, however, are the concurrent changes in belowground (BG) C storage. Here we inventoried AG and BG C stocks in disturbed and undisturbed tundra ecosystems to determine the effects of disturbance on tundra C balance.\nWe measured differences in plant functional type, AG and BG biomass, soil C, and specific leaf area (SLA) for the dominant shrub (Salix) in 2 tundra ecosystems in northern Siberia—an undisturbed moist acidic tundra and an adjacent ecosystem that was used as a road ~50 years ago. Deciduous shrubs and grasses dominated both ecosystems, but biomass for both functional types was higher in the disturbed area. SLA was also higher inside the disturbance. Conversely, nonvascular plants and evergreen shrubs were less abundant in the disturbed area. BG plant biomass was substantially greater than AG biomass. On average, soil C pool in organic and mineral soils was higher in the disturbed areas. Our results illustrate changes in ecosystem structure and function associated with disturbance that may become increasingly important with continued climate warming and subsequent human activity in the Arctic.",

            "abstract": "Drivers of hydrothermal venting at mid-ocean ridges are crustal permeability and heat derived from magma, but their relative contributions remain enigmatic, thus raising the question why vents occur where they do. Currently, observational data are ambiguous and biased toward actively venting sites. However, new AUV Sentry bathymetric data from the 92W segment of the Galapagos Spreading Center from the 2010 GRUVEE expedition provide 0.5 m gridded maps that resolve individual chimneys, at least 2m tall and 0.75 m wide, directly. Comparing chimney features from the 23 vents found in the Alvin video with the AUV Sentry bathymetry establishes criteria that allow many other vents to be identified in our study area using only bathymetric data and without need for direct visual observation. Thus, we have a nearly complete record of both active and inactive hydrothermal chimneys over the entire length of a mid-ocean ridge segment to correlate with other seafloor features for further analysis. We use lava morphology, extent of mapped lava flow units, and volcanic features such as tumuli and pillow mounds as proxies for volcanic heat. Magmatic heat input, on a longer timescale, may be estimated by using seismic data on the thickness of layer 2A, depth to the magma lens, or crustal thickness as proxies. For permeability proxies, over 350 fault segments and 150+ fissures have been cataloged on this segment. By analyzing the locations of all these features relative to hydrothermal chimneys, it is possible to correlate crustal permeability and lava morphology with the distribution of vents and to provide empirical constraints on whether certain types of seafloor terrain are more conducive to hosting hydrothermal chimneys. Preliminary analysis suggests a strong correlation between chimneys and nearby mounds and major faults. All 23 chimneys seen with Alvin, inactive and active, are within 30 m of mounds. Considering both chimneys seen from Alvin and a partial catalog of those only detected by Sentry bathymetry, they appear aligned with major faults that comprise the axial summit graben boundaries.",

With increased computational power, and technological advancements it is now possible to create realistic models of fluid flow through highly complex porous media by using a number of fluid dynamic techniques. One such technique that has gained popularity is lattice Boltzmann for its relative ease of programming and ability to capture and represent complex geometries with simple boundary conditions. In this study lattice Boltzmann fluid models are used on macro-porous silt loam soil imagery that was obtained using an industrial CT scanner. The soil imagery was segmented with six separate automated segmentation standards to reduce operator bias and provide distinction between phases. The permeability of the reconstructed samples was calculated, with Darcy’s Law, from lattice Boltzmann simulations of fluid flow in the samples. We attempt to validate simulated permeability from differing segmentation algorithms to experimental findings. Limitations arise with X-ray micro-CT image data. Polychromatic X-ray CT has the potential to produce low image contrast and image artifacts. In this case, we find that the data is unsegmentable and unable to be modeled in a realistic and unbiased fashion.",

            "abstract": "Green infrastructure in urbanized areas commonly uses infiltration systems, such as rain gardens, swales and trenches, to convey surface runoff from impervious surfaces into surrounding soils. However, precipitation inputs can exceed soil infiltration rates, creating a limit to infiltration-based storm water management, particularly in urban areas covered by impervious surfaces. Given the limited availability and varied quality of soil infiltration rate data, we synthesized information from national databases, available field test data, and applicable literature to characterize soil infiltration rate distributions, focusing on Allegheny County, Pennsylvania as a case study. A range of impervious cover conditions was defined by sampling available GIS data (e.g., LiDAR and street edge lines) with analysis windows placed randomly across urbanization gradients. Changes in effective precipitation caused by impervious cover were calculated across these gradients and compared to infiltration rate distributions to identify thresholds in impervious coverage where these limits are exceeded. Many studies have demonstrated the effects of urbanization on infiltration, but the identification of these thresholds will clarify interactions between impervious cover and soil infiltration. These methods can help identify sections of urban areas that require augmentation of infiltration-based systems with additional infrastructural strategies, especially as green infrastructure moves beyond low impact development towards more frequent application during infilling of existing urban systems.",

            "abstract": "The response of shallow cloud systems to changes in atmospheric greenhouse gases and aerosols is a major source of uncertainty limiting the accuracy of predictions of future climate. Factors contributing to this uncertainty are drizzle formation and intensity. Drizzle is ubiquitous in low-level clouds, and the two primary parameters that control the production (autoconversion) and development (accretion) of drizzle are liquid water path (LWP) and aerosol loading. While LWP is the dominant parameter controlling the production and development of drizzle, several numerical studies and field observations have provided evidence of an aerosol role in drizzle suppression. However, it remains unclear to what extent small-scale turbulence influences the production and development of drizzle in low-level stratiform clouds. Here, we use observations from the US Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Mobile Facility (AMF) deployments in the Black Forest, Germany, from April to December 2007 and at the Azores from June 2009 to December 2010. Several days of continental and maritime stratocumulus clouds are identified. Using synergy between ground-based aerosol observing systems and active and passive remote-sensing instruments, time series of LWP, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) number concentration (NCCN), and cloud base drizzle rate (RCB) are derived (Mann et al., 2014). This dataset is conditionally sampled with respect to LWP and NCCN, and for each subset within a specific range of LWP and NCCN values, several additional parameters are estimated to provide information on drizzle onset, drizzle growth and in-cloud turbulence. In particular, the profiling cloud radar Doppler spectra dataset is used to estimate the radar Doppler spectrum skewness, a particularly sensitive parameter in the detection of drizzle onset (Kollias et al., 2011). The rate of drizzle growth is determined using average profiles of radar reflectivity and mean Doppler velocity. In addition, we derive in-cloud turbulent eddy dissipation rates using time-series of radar Doppler velocities and radar Doppler spectrum width observations (Borque et al., 2014). All of these new parameters are utilized to investigate the level of turbulence in low stratiform clouds and its relationship to drizzle onset and growth.",

            "abstract": "Our understanding of wind and wave driven currents in the coastal ocean has been limited by our inability to measure currents within a few meters of the surface. To improve our understanding of current dynamics in the upper few meters of the ocean we combine 8 months of ADCP measurements from the Martha’s Vineyard Coastal Observatory with high-frequency (HF) radar measurements of surface currents. These techniques compliment each other, as the HF radar can only observe the surface velocities, and the ADCP cannot take accurate measurements in the upper few meters of the water column. We find that currents can vary significantly over the upper two meters of the inner shelf. Extrapolations to the surface based on the ADCP data are inconsistent with that observed by the HF radar. When different types of forcing conditions were examined, it was found that this difference is most evident in cases when wind stresses are weak (<less than 0.05 Pa) and waves are large (greater than 0.6m). In this case, the cross-shore HF radar observations were onshore, in the opposite direction of the near-surface ADCP observations. Models indicate this difference can be attributed in part to Stokes’ drift, measured by the HF radar but not the ADCP. When the ADCP velocities are corrected for Stokes’ drift, the difference between the HF radar surface current and the top ADCP current is consistent with a simple model of near-surface wind-driven current shear. This suggests future attempts to extrapolate ADCP currents toward the surface should consider wind-driven shear. This result can be used to more accurately estimate onshore transport, which has applications in calculating nutrient and pollutant transport.",

In the last decade, 48 infrasound stations from the International Monitoring System (IMS) have been installed and are transmitting data to the IDC. The infrasound component of the IMS daily registers infragenic signals originating from various sources such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, microbaroms, meteorites entering the atmosphere and accidental explosions. The IDC routinely and automatically processes infrasound data reviewed by interactive analysis; the detected and located events are then included in the IDC products.\nThe IDC advances its methods and continuously improves its automatic system for the infrasound technology. The IDC focuses on enhancing the automatic system for the identification of valid signals and the optimization of the network detection threshold by identifying ways to refine signal characterization methodology and association criteria. An objective of this study is to reduce the number of associated infrasound arrivals that are rejected from the automatic bulletins when generating the reviewed event bulletins. A number of ongoing projects at the IDC will be presented, such as:\n- improving the detection accuracy at the station processing stage by enhancing the infrasound signal detector DFX-PMCC (Detection and Feature eXtraction – Progressive Multi-Channel Correlation) and by evaluating the performances of detection software.\n- separating infrasound data from other waveform technologies at the automatic network processing stage for technology development and for preparing the implementation of next generation of waveform association algorithm. Infrasound rules in Global Association (GA) are revisited to pursue a lower ratio of false alarms.\n- determining station noise for IMS infrasound, seismic and hydroacoustic stations sending data to the IDC. The data is used for assessing the network capability performances and for assisting station maintenance. It allows for the investigation of a method whereby an acoustic event source size could be indicated as a magnitude estimate.",

            "abstract": "The Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) is supporting NASA’s SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) satellite mission, which launches in January 2015. SMAP will measure global soil moisture and its freeze-thaw state every 3 days using an L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and radiometer. ASF, along with the National Snow and Ice Data Center DAAC and NASA’s Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS), is identifying and developing tools and technologies to facilitate use of global, near-real-time data by the SMAP user community. ASF will host the SMAP Level 1 radar data and make them available for download through ASF's data discovery interface, Vertex, and the ASF Application Programming Interface. Vertex allows a user to search, visualize and download SAR data, browse images and relevant metadata, and will offer the complete SMAP L1 radar archive to the public. The entire SMAP archive consisting of level 1-4 data can be accessed via Reverb, the NASA EOSDIS metadata and service discovery tool. In anticipation of the SMAP launch and data release, ASF has developed and released a new website (\nhttps://www.asf.alaska.edu/smap/\n) and a suite of web resources, including interactive media, technical information, a product guide, related publications, and tools for working with the HDF5 data format. The ASF SMAP team is exploring OPeNDAP and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Webification technologies for enhancing in-browser data visualization and analysis. These technologies, and tools developed with them, represent opportunities for exposing this valuable dataset to areas with limited bandwidth or understanding of radar data. This presentation will highlight the enabling technologies and techniques ASF is employing to bring these data to new scientific and applications users and respond to ever-changing user needs.",

            "abstract": "Land surface moisture content affects the partitioning of radiative energy into heat and moisture fluxes at the land surface, and thus can affect the state of the overlying atmosphere by supplying water vapor, inducing moist convection and lateral convergence, and growing the planetary boundary layer. However, it is difficult to determine how this influence may in turn affect the propensity for subsequent precipitation. Empirical studies have disagreed on the sign and statistical significance of the estimated influence of soil moisture on precipitation, and have suffered from the difficulty of distinguishing a causal effect from lagged correlations that arise from the autocorrelation, seasonality, and interannual variability of each signal. Modeling studies can more easily establish causality, but feedback behavior has been shown to vary widely among models. We apply Granger Causality (Granger (1969), Econometrica, 37: 424-438) to quantitatively diagnose the relationship between soil moisture state and the occurrence of subsequent precipitation, and implement it over the contiguous United States using remotely sensed soil moisture and gauge-based precipitation observations. This is accomplished through a generalized linear model (GLM), specifically a probit regression model, constructed to estimate the observed record of precipitation occurrence. Predictor variables included in the regression account for external atmospheric and climatic influences on precipitation, the prior occurrence of precipitation, and previous day soil moisture anomalies. We find a generally positive soil moisture-precipitation feedback in the western part of the United States and a negative feedback in the east. These findings suggest that processes linking soil moisture to precipitation triggering may differ in arid versus humid climate regimes, and that soil moisture state can play an important role in determining future weather conditions.",

            "abstract": "Glacial landforms are generated from the activity of glaciers and display spatial dimensions ranging from below one meter up to tens of kilometers. Glacial landforms are used as diagnostic features of past activity of ice sheets and glaciers; they are specifically important in the field of palaeoglaciology. Mapping of submarine glacial landforms is largely dependent on geophysical survey methods capable of imaging the seafloor and sub-bottom through the water column. Full “global” seafloor mapping coverage, equivalent to what exists for land elevation, is to-date only achieved by the powerful method of deriving bathymetry from altimeters on satellites like GEOSAT and ERS-1. The lateral resolution of satellite derived bathymetry is, however, limited by the footprint of the satellite and the need to average out local wave and wind effects resulting in values of around 15 km. Consequently, mapping submarine glacial landforms requires for the most part higher resolution than is achievable by satellite derived bathymetry. The most widely-used methods for mapping submarine glacial landforms are based on echo-sounding principles. This presentation shows how the evolution of marine geophysical mapping techniques, in particular the advent of side-scan and multibeam bathymetric sonars, has made it possible to study submarine glacial landforms in unprecedented detail. Examples are shown from the Atlas of Submarine Glacial Landforms: Modern, Quaternary and Ancient, which will be published in late 2015 in the Memoir Series of the Geological Society of London.",

            "abstract": "The California Air Resources Board is developing a compliance offset protocol for rice cultivation practices. This protocol contains three different activities that growers can take to reduce the generation of methane associated with rice cultivation – dry seeding, early drainage, and alternate wetting and drying of fields. All of these practices have been developed using the latest science and have been shown to reduce methane generation without impacting yield. Methane is the second largest anthropogenic source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, accounting for 9% of all U.S. GHG emissions from human activities. Methane is also important because it is more than 20 times more potent a GHG than carbon dioxide. The rice cultivation protocol is important because it will be the first crop-based protocol considered as a part of California’s cap-and-trade program. This session will discuss the latest developments with the protocol from stakeholders involved in the creation of the protocol. We invite you to hear lessons learnt from this experience in order to apply similar approaches to other regions/countries and crops.",

            "abstract": "Certain microorganisms e.g., Sporosarcina pasteurii contribute enzymes that catalyze reactions which in the presence of calcium, can create saturation conditions favorable for calcium carbonate precipitation (microbially-induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP)). MICP can be used for a number of engineering applications including securing geologic storage of CO2 or other fluids by sealing fractures, improving wellbore integrity, and stabilizing fractured and unstable porous media. MICP treatment has the advantage of the use of small microorganisms, ~2μm, suggesting applicability to treatment of small aperture fractures not accessible to traditional treatments, for example the use of fine cement. The promotion of MICP in the subsurface is a complex reactive transport problem coupling microbial, abiotic (geochemical), geomechanical and hydrodynamic processes.\nIn the laboratory, MICP has been demonstrated to cement together heavily fractured shale and reduce the permeability of fractures in shale and sandstone cores up to five orders of magnitude under both ambient and subsurface relevant pressure conditions (Figure 1). Most recently, a MICP fracture treatment field study was performed at a well at the Southern Company Gorgas Steam Generation Plant (Alabama) (Figure 1). The Fayetteville Sandstone at approximately 1120’ below ground surface was hydraulically fractured prior to MICP treatment. After 4 days of injection of 24 calcium pulses and 6 microbial inoculations, injectivity of brine into the formation was significantly reduced. The experiment also resulted in a reduction in pressure decay which is a measure of improved wellbore integrity. These promising results suggest the potential for MICP treatment to seal fractured pathways at the field scale to improve the long-term security of geologically-stored carbon dioxide or prevent leakage of shale gas or hydraulic fracturing fluids into functional overlying aquifers, reducing environmental impacts.",

Before considering stimulation strategies, simulating heat extraction from the reservoir under in-situ fracture geometries will give a first-order estimation of extractable heat. With only limited deep boreholes drilled on the SRP, few analyses of the bulk hydrologic properties of the tuffs exist. Acknowledging the importance of the spatial heterogeneity of fractures to the permeability and injectivity of reservoirs hosted in impermeable volcanic units, we present fracture distributions from ICDP hole 5036-2A drilled as a part of Project HOTSPOT. The core documents more than 1200 m of largely homogeneous densely welded tuff hosting an isothermal warm-water reservoir at ~60˚ C. Multiple realizations of a hypothetical reservoir are created using sequential indicator algorithms that honor the observed vertical fracture frequency statistics. Results help form criteria for producing geothermal energy from the SRP.",

            "abstract": "Grasslands dominated by taxa using the C4 photosynthetic pathway evolved on several continents during the Neogene and Quaternary, long after C4 photosynthesis first evolved among grasses. The histories of these ecosystems are relatively well documented in the geological record from stable carbon isotopes (fossil vertebrate herbivores, paleosols) and the plant microfossil record (pollen, phytoliths). The distinct biogeography and ecophysiology of modern C3 and C4 grasses have led to hypotheses explaining the origins of C4 grasslands in terms of long term changes in the Earth system such as increased aridity and decreasing atmospheric pCO2. However, proxies for key parameters of these hypotheses (e.g., temperature, precipitation, pCO2) are still in development, not yet widely applied, or remain contentious, so testing the hypotheses globally remains difficult. To understand better possible links between changes in the Earth system and the origin of C4 grasslands on different continents, we are undertaking a global scale comparison between observational records of C4 grass abundances in Miocene and Pliocene localities compiled from the literature, and three increasingly complex models of C4 dominance and abundance. The literature compilation comprises >2,600 δ13C values of both fossil vertebrates and of paleosol carbonates and >6,700 paleobotanical records. We are using paleoclimate output from the HadCM3L GCM over a range of pCO2 values for each epoch to model C4 dominance or abundance in grid cells as (Model 1) months per year exceeding the temperature at which net assimilation is greater for C4 than C3 photosynthesis (crossover temperature); (Model 2) the number of months per year exceeding the crossover temperature and having sufficient precipitation for growth (≥25 cm/yr; Collatz model); and (Model 3) the Sheffield Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (SDGVM), output from which includes biomass (g C/m2/yr) for distinct structural components (roots, stems, leaves) of multiple plant functional types (C3 and C4 grasses, evergreen and deciduous trees). Statistical comparisons of the isotopic and paleobotanical databases with the paleoclimate and vegetation model outputs allows us to assess the possible role of abiotic factors in the evolution of modern C4 grasslands during the late Neogene.",

            "abstract": "High latitude forest and peatland soils represent a major terrestrial carbon store sensitive to climate change. Warming temperatures and increased growing-season evapotranspiration are projected to reduce water table (WT) height in continental peatlands. WT reduction increases peat aerobicity and facilitates vascular plant and root growth. Root-associated microbial communities are exposed to a different physical and chemical environment than microbial communities in non-root associated “bulk” peat, and therefore have distinct composition and function within the soil system. As the size of the peatland rhizosphere impacts resources available to the microbial communities, transitions from a root-free high water table peatland to a root-dominated low WT peatland may alter seasonal patterns of microbial community dynamics, enzyme production, and carbon storage within the system.\nWe used a natural water table gradient in Caribou Bog near Orono, ME to explore the influence of species composition, root biomass, and rhizosphere size on seasonal patterns in microbial community structure, enzyme production, and carbon mineralization. We quantified root biomass across the water table gradient and measured microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, C mineralization, N mineralization, and exoenzyme activity in root-associated and bulk peat samples throughout the 2013 growing season. Microbial biomass was consistently higher in rhizosphere-associated soils and peaked in the spring. Microbial biomass CN and enzyme activity was higher in rhizosphere-associated soil, likely due to increased mycorrhizal abundance. Exoenzyme activity peaked in the fall, with a larger relative increase in enzyme activity in rhizosphere peat, while carbon mineralization rates did not demonstrate a strong seasonal pattern. The results suggest that rhizosphere-associated peat sustains higher and more variable rates of enzyme activity throughout the growing season, which results in higher rates of carbon mineralization driven by increased microbial biomass. Increases in vascular plant abundance and root biomass may therefore increase overall rates of carbon mineralization and peat decomposition within peatland systems and influence the nature of the peatland carbon store.",

            "abstract": "In this contribution, we interrogate the timing of km-scale topography development in the region around Yosemite Valley, California. Our goal is to determine when this spectacular glacial valley was carved, and how this might help address controversy surrounding the topographic evolution of the Sierra Nevada. At the scale of the range, two rival hypotheses are each supported by different datasets. Low-temperature thermochronology supports the idea that the range has been high-standing since the Cretaceous, whereas geomorphic evidence suggests that much of the elevation of the Sierra Nevada was attained during the Pliocene. Recent work by McPhillips and Brandon (2012) suggests instead that both ideas are valid, with the range losing much elevation during the Cenozoic, but regaining it during Miocene surface uplift.\nAt the local scale, the classic study of Matthes (1930) determined that most of Yosemite Valley was excavated by the Sherwin-age glaciation that ended ~1 Ma. The consensus view is in agreement, although some argue that nearby comparable valleys comparable were carved long ago (e.g., House et al., 1998). If the Quaternary and younger glaciations were responsible for the bulk of the valley’s >1 km depth, we might expect apatite (U-Th)/He ages at the valley floor to be <2 Ma. Instead, samples collected from bedrock outcrop at the floor of Tenaya Canyon, yield ages ranging from 35-40 Ma, while a sample from El Portal yields an age of ~74 Ma. Valley rim samples yield ages of ca. 60 Ma.\nTo further constrain the timing of valley carving, we have conducted apatite 4He/3He thermochronometry from samples along both the valley floor and rim. By restricting the permissible thermal histories at these locations, these data constrain patterns of valley topography development through time. We also supplement these data with zircon 4He/3He thermochronometry, which is a newly developed method that provides information on continuous cooling paths through ~120-220 °C. We will present both the apatite and zircon 4He/3He data and, in conjunction with thermo-kinematic modeling, discuss the ability and limitations of these data to test models of Sierra Nevada topography development through time.\nMatthes (1930) USGS Professional Paper\nHouse et al.

            "abstract": "Over the past century, northeast Pacific coastal sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and land-based surface air temperatures (SATs) display multidecadal variations associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, in addition to a warming trend of ~0.5 to 1°C. Using independent records of sea-level pressure (SLP), SST and SAT, this study investigates NE Pacific coupled atmosphere-ocean variability from 1900 to 2012, with emphasis on the coastal areas around North America. We use a linear stochastic time series model to show that the SST evolution around the NE Pacific coast can be explained by a combination of regional atmospheric forcing and ocean persistence, accounting for 63% of nonseasonal monthly SST variance (r = 0.79) and 73% of variance in annual means (r = 0.86). We show that SLP reductions and related atmospheric forcing led to century-long warming around the NE Pacific margins, with strongest trends observed from 1910-20 to 1940. NE Pacific circulation changes are estimated to account for more than 80% of the 1900-2012 linear warming in coastal NE Pacific SST and US Pacific northwest (Washington, Oregon and northern California) SAT. An ensemble of climate model simulations run under the same historical radiative forcings fails to reproduce the observed regional circulation trends. These results suggest that natural, internally-generated changes in atmospheric circulation were the primary cause of coastal NE Pacific warming from 1900 to 2012, and demonstrate more generally that regional mechanisms of interannual and multidecadal temperature variability can also extend to century time scales.",

            "abstract": "Recent investigations in Thuringia, Central Germany, focus on the potential for carbon sequestration, groundwater supply and geothermal energy. We report on the results of an integrated fault-slip data analysis to characterize the geometries and kinematics of systematic fractures in contrasting basement and cover rock lithologies.\nThe lithostratigraphy of the area comprises locally exposed crystalline rocks and intermittently overlying Permian volcanic and clastic sedimentary rocks, together referred to as basement. A Late Permian sequence of evaporites, carbonates and shale constitutes the transition to the continuous sedimentary cover of Triassic age. Major NW-SE-striking fault zones and minor NNE-SSW-striking faults affect this stratigraphic succession. These characteristic narrow deforming areas (< 3 km width) build a dense network of individual fault strands with a close juxtaposition to wider (> 15 km) non-deforming areas suggesting localized zones of mechanical weakness, which can be confirmed by the frequent reactivation of single fault strands.\nAlong the major fault zones, the basement and cover contain dominant inclined to sub-vertical NW-SE-striking fractures. These fractures indicate successive normal, dextral strike-slip and reverse senses of slip, evidencing events of NNE-SSW extension and contraction. Another system of mostly sub-vertical NNW-SSE- and NE-SW-striking conjugate strike-slip faults mainly developed within the cover implies NNE-SSW contraction and WNW-ESE extension. Earthquake focal mechanisms and in-situ stress measurements reveal a NW-SE trend for the modern SHmax. Nevertheless, fractures and fault-slip indicators are rare in the non-deforming areas, which characterizes Thuringia as a dual domain of (1) large unfractured areas and (2) narrow zones of high potential for technical applications. Our data therefore provide a basis for estimation of slip and dilation tendency of the contrasting fractures in the basement and cover under the present-day stress field, which must be taken into account for different subsurface technical approaches.",

            "abstract": "During the late Pleistocene and early to mid-Holocene, northern Africa experienced sufficient rainfall to support annual vegetation and widespread lakes. This humid climate state is known as the African Humid Period (AHP). Geologic evidence suggests that the transitions into and out of the AHP occurred rapidly, potentially within a span of decades to centuries. Despite considerable effort to understand the response of precipitation during the AHP, the mechanisms by which the abrupt climate transitions over Africa occurred remain unclear. Here, we use an ensemble of coupled earth system model experiments to explore the role of regional and synoptic-scale atmospheric circulation in Africa during the AHP. Specifically, we analyze characteristics of transient, synoptic-scale weather systems and quantify the relationship between these systems and rainfall in Africa. Preliminary results show that orbital forcing-driven changes in insolation during the AHP weaken surface meridional temperature gradients over Africa and modify the characteristics and energetics of synoptic-scale phenomena, including African easterly waves (AEWs). These results indicate a potential shift in the atmospheric processes that influence precipitation between humid and arid states in northern Africa. We explore whether the insolation-driven changes in local atmospheric processes, in particular the changes in AEWs, contribute to rapid climate reorganization in Africa.",

            "abstract": "1,4-dioxane is an emerging groundwater contaminant and a likely human carcinogen. Due to its history as a stabilizer in chlorinated solvents, 1,4-dioxane is often found as a co-contaminant at solvent releases sites such as landfills, solvent recycling facilities, vapor decreasing operations, and fire-training areas. Historically, 1,4-dioxane was not routinely analyzed for at solvent release sites. The lack of analyses and the limitations of the analyses that were performed (i.e. high reporting limits) means that the scale of 1,4-dioxane subsurface contamination is still emerging. With the number of known 1,4-dioxane sites increasing, the need for cost effective 1,4-dioxane remediation technologies is rising as well. Remediation strategies that are capable of treating both 1,4-dioxane as well as chlorinated co-contaminants are of particular importance, especially when treating mixed-waste source zones.\nIn the present study, we examined the fate of 1,4-dioxane during the targeted remediation of aqueous phase volatile organic compounds (VOC) using an activated persulfate based ISCO method (OxyZone®). Bench scale laboratory experiments are used to evaluate the treatability of 1,4-dioxane both as a single compound and in the presence of trichloroethene (TCE) and 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA). Possible dependencies on oxidant concentration and reaction kinetics were studied. Preliminary results are promising and show that OxyZone® is persistent and long lived, with oxidation of 1,4-dioxane continuing more than 12 days after initial dosage, even at dilute oxidant concentrations. The oxidative destruction of 1,4-dioxane, TCE and 1,1,1-TCA in single compound batch systems followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics. The rate of oxidation for each contaminant increased linearly with increasing persulfate concentration over the range of oxidant concentrations tested. The rate of oxidative destruction, from most easily degraded to least was: TCE > 1,4-Dioxane > 1,1,1-TCA. Experiments examining the destruction of 1,4-dioxane in the presence of TCE and 1,1,1-TCA are ongoing. The final results of this study will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Chute cutoffs, which occur when a bypass or “chute” channel incises across a point or braid bar, distribute water and sediment, regulate sinuosity, and create off-channel habitat in wandering gravel-bed rivers. Cutoffs have been hypothesized to occur by progressive migration preparing a bend for cutoff, after which overbank flow events provide a trigger to excavate new channels. This trigger may depend on the magnitude and duration of floods and their associated sediment fluxes. Here we investigated how overbank flow duration impacts cutoff formation in a wandering gravel-bed river. To explore this, we applied a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model to a recently reconstructed reach of the Clark Fork River in western Montana that experienced chute cutoffs during a long-duration flood event in 2011. Hydrographs exceeding bankfull and with varying durations were simulated to constrain the role of overbank flow duration on erosional work in chute cutoff channels. For each magnitude-frequency-duration combination, cumulative excess shear stress (i.e., above the threshold of sediment mobilization) was quantified for in-channel and overbank areas. Locations of shear stress divergence associated with morphological change were identified along chute pathways. Preliminary results suggest that overbank areas containing concentrated flowpaths such as swales follow cumulative excess shear stress curve patterns similar to in-channel areas. This work describes a dynamic system characteristic of wandering gravel-bed rivers in the Pacific Northwest, and has implications for understanding morphodynamic evolution, river restoration targeting off-channel habitat for fish, and geomorphic flow regime management in regulated rivers.",

            "abstract": "GPS monuments around the world exhibit seasonal signals in both the horizontal and vertical components with amplitudes on the order of centimeters. For analysis of tectonic signals, researchers typically fit and remove a sine wave with an annual period, and sometimes an additional sine wave with a semiannual period. As interest grows in analyzing smaller, slower signals it becomes more important to correct for these seasonal signals accurately. It is well established that the vertical component of seasonal GPS signals is largely due to continental water storage cycles (e.g. van Dam et al., GRL, 2001). Horizontal seasonal signals however are not well explained by continental water storage. We examine horizontal seasonal signals across western North America and find that the horizontal component is coherent at very large spatial scales and is in general oriented perpendicular to the nearest coastline, indicating an oceanic origin. Additionally, horizontal and vertical annual signals are out of phase by approximately 2 months indicating different physical origins. Studies of GRACE and ocean bottom pressure data indicate an annual variation of non-steric, non-tidal ocean height with an average amplitude of 1 cm globally (e.g. Ponte et al., GRL, 2007). We use Some Programs for Ocean Tide Loading (SPOTL; Agnew, SIO Technical Report, 2012) to model predicted displacements due to these (non-tidal) ocean loads and find general agreement with observed horizontal GPS seasonal signals. In the future, this may lead to a more accurate way to predict and remove the seasonal component of GPS displacement time-series, leading to better discrimination of the true tectonic signal. Modeling this long wavelength signal also provides a potential opportunity to probe the structure of the Earth.",

            "abstract": "Step-overs and bends along strike-slip faults can serve as impediments to earthquake rupture. Over many earthquake cycles, these irregularities can develop slip deficits so that the local long-term strike-slip rates do not match the slip rates away from the bends and step-overs. Physical analog models show that bends and stepovers propagate new faults and evolve in order to more efficiently accommodate applied strike-slip thereby reducing off-fault deformation. Numerical models permit evaluation of the energy associated with fault propagation and can predict fault evolution over multiple earthquake cycles using work minimization. The algorithm GROW (GRowth by Optimization of Work) honors tensile and frictional failure criteria along pre-existing surfaces and at fault tips, while allowing the orientation of fault growth within the system to be governed by the global energy budget. In GROW, faults evolve in order to minimize deformation energy, thereby maximizing the mechanical efficiency of the entire system. Using GROW, we subject systems of two right-lateral, strike-slip faults that are initially right-stepping, with varying separation distances and strengths, to remotely applied displacement. We track the propagation paths across the intervening releasing bend. We find that fault strength and initial separation control fault linkage propensity and linkage patterns. In order to build insight into the efficiency gains provided by hard- versus soft-linkage, we also track the work budget of these fault systems as they evolve. For example, linkage of faults may reduce internal work while increasing frictional work and seismic work. Assuming that increasing efficiency correlates with increasing potential for a single earthquake to rupture both faults, this approach has utility for assessing the evolution of seismic hazard as segmented faults systems change over geologic time.",

This presentation provides an overview of the Global Integrated Drought Monitoring and Prediction System (GIDMaPS) which offers near real-time drought information using both remote sensing observations and model simulations. Designed as a cyberinfrastructure system, GIDMaPS provides drought information based on a wide range of model simulations and satellite observations from different space agencies. Numerous indices have been developed for drought monitoring based on various indicator variables (e.g., precipitation, soil moisture, water storage). Defining droughts based on a single variable (e.g., precipitation, soil moisture or runoff) may not be sufficient for reliable risk assessment and decision making. GIDMaPS provides drought information based on multiple indices including Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized Soil Moisture Index (SSI) and the Multivariate Standardized Drought Index (MSDI) which combines SPI and SSI probabilistically. In other words, MSDI incorporates the meteorological and agricultural drought conditions for overall characterization of droughts, and better management and distribution of water resources among and across different users. The seasonal prediction component of GIDMaPS is based on a persistence model which requires historical data and near-past observations. The seasonal drought prediction component is designed to provide drought information for water resource management, and short-term decision making. In this presentation, both monitoring and prediction components of GIDMaPS will be discussed, and the results from several major droughts including the 2013 Namibia, 2012-2013 United States, 2011-2012 Horn of Africa, and 2010 Amazon Droughts will be presented. The presentation will highlight how this drought cyberinfrastructure system can be used to improve water resource management in California. Furthermore, the presentation provides an overview of the information farmers need for better decision making and how GIDMaPS can be used to improve decision making and reducing drought impacts.",

            "abstract": "Future projections of food security require historical agricultural assessments to validate, improve, and understand the limitations of yield estimates. Poor observational climate networks often force historical assessments to rely on reanalysis data- climate model output nudged by observations- for inputs to crop models. However, agricultural yields are sensitive to changes in precipitation, and since reanalysis products generally use little or no observational precipitation in the data assimilation process, its use may compromise the validation exercise. Previous studies do not systematically assess whether reanalysis data is sufficient or data measurements are required. We test the reliability of reanalysis data for agricultural analyses with simulations of maize yields in the U.S., where observational data are extensive. We drive the widely used Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop model with climate inputs from a combination of data sources: bias- and unbias-corrected reanalyses, and observation-based precipitation and solar radiation. We find that driving DSSAT with reanalysis precipitation produces unreliable yield estimates, but driving it with reanalysis bias-corrected with monthly observations is more robust. Bias corrections do require observational data, but gathering reliable monthly data may be easier than gathering daily data. The approach is therefore promising for data-poor regions where observational precipitation is less available and existing data is unreliable. The priority for climate monitoring networks may not be in daily records but instead in lower-cost observational systems that estimate data over coarser temporal resolutions.",

            "abstract": "Reconnection exhausts in Earth’s magnetotail are characterized by complex ion velocity distributions, which often exhibit two or more maxima indicative of multiple beam-like populations. 2D implicit PIC simulations of tail reconnection with a weak guide field (Bg=0.1B0) are used to study the evolution of these ion beams between the x-point and the magnetic pileup region at the interface between the exhaust and the pre-reconnection current sheet. This pileup region, which is characterized by a local increase in Bz-GSM, is also known as a dipolarization front (DF). We follow, both forward and backward in time, the trajectories of collections of ions from the beam-like populations at different spatial locations. By doing so, we are able to determine from where these ions originate as well as to where they ultimately propagate. For example counter-streaming ion beams near the DF are found to originate on the flanks of the pre-reconnection current sheet, consistent with the model of Nagai et al. [Phys. Plasmas, 9, 3705 (2002)]. These ions get swept up via complex interactions with both the “reconnection” (Ey-GSM) and “Hall” (Ez-GSM) electric fields before crossing just upstream of the DF. After crossing, the ions in the beams alternately gain and lose energy, primarily through interactions with Ey-GSM, which has a maximum amplitude in the vicinity of the DF. The weak guide field introduces a significant North-South asymmetry in the beam trajectories. The ions in these beams, which have a small energy spread when the beams cross, ultimately develop a large spread in both energy and position, indicative of heating through interactions with the DF electric field. These simulation studies are used to help interpret recent Themis observations of multiple ion populations near the DF. These results are also relevant to the upcoming MMS mission, which will provide multipoint particle distribution measurements with unprecedented temporal resolution.",

            "abstract": "A prominent integrated assessment model (IAM), the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), has been coupled with the Community Land Model (CLM) of the Community Earth system model (CESM) to assess the vulnerability of the US agriculture and energy sectors to future water shortages under changing climate and socioeconomics. This study utilizes the regionalized version of GCAM for the U.S. with 50-state. GCAM-USA includes a detailed representation of water demands and tracks them at multiple spatial scales and annual scale. A spatial and temporal disaggregation approach is developed to project the annual regional water demand simulations into a daily time step and 1/8o spatial resolution for input to CLM, which has been coupled to a river routing model and generic water management model applicable globally at 1/2o resolution and regionally at 1/8o resolution. The coupled modeling framework demonstrated reasonable ability to simulate the historical flow regulation and water supply over the continental U.S.\nThe coupled modeling framework has been used to investigate: 1) Which water use sector (agriculture or energy) and subbasins in the conterminous U.S. will experience water deficits in future decades; 2) What are the drivers for the deficit (i.e., water availability, water demands, or both); 3) Will climate mitigation policies alleviate or exacerbate the situation; and lastly 4) How will the frequency , severity, and spatial extent of water deficits (hot spots) evolve under a non-mitigation scenario (RCP8.5) in which conventional fossil-fueled technologies prevail versus a mitigation scenario (RCP4.5) in which the carbon price causes a shift toward renewables and expansion of bioenergy productions. Results show that irrigation will face greater water deficit overall except in the northeastern U.S. Water deficit is greatest in the western U.S. except the Pacific Northwest. Human footprints on the regulated flows are most pronounced over the Rio Grande, Colorado, Great Lake, Great, and Missouri basins. Overall, total water deficit in term of both total volume and land area are projected to increase in the future under both RCPs.",

At its current stage of development, IRTAM is an ionospheric weather now-casting model that improves the classic climatology, on average, more than twofold. The IRTAM is able to reproduce major effects that are caused by various events of both solar and terrestrial origin.\nNext step in further IRTAM development is directed towards its forecasting capability. We would like to know how temporal harmonics of the IRTAM specification of foF2/hmF2 are affected during disturbed conditions. Can we find patterns in their behavior and relate them to particular geomagnetic and solar activity indices? Can we forecast ionospheric conditions using previously observed patterns of behavior? To answer these questions we first investigate known storm events during the latest solar cycle. We calculate IRTAM global foF2/hmF2 expansion maps to look for hidden associations of the underlying map constituents to identify those responsible for particular features in foF2/hmF2 global behavior. This effort will result in a classification catalog of the feature patterns corresponding to these known events. We will compare these patterns to the IRI storm-time foF2 timelines. We expect such analysis to reveal various categories of events and to guide our further efforts towards a forecasting IRTAM.",

            "abstract": "Banding along the lower flanks of Mount Sharp has generally been interpreted to indicate stratigraphy within the mound that dips gently outward from it. Many of these bands define prominent terraces that can be traced nearly to closure around the mound, potentially providing chronostratigraphic markers. However, comparing orbital imagery and digital elevation models with ground-based views from Curiosity’s Mastcam suggests much of the banding might indicate buttress unconformities of now-largely-deflated plains units and/or paleolake strandlines that may not extend into the subsurface. Resistant horizons that parallel the upper surface of the mound can be identified in several erosional pits and along flanks of many of the butte “foothills” of Mt Sharp. These surfaces suggest that Mt Sharp was emplaced as a mound that may have been a few percent larger than the modern remnant, but that likely never extended across Gale crater and over the surrounding highland terrains.\nOther geomorphic surfaces – e.g., the fan-shaped feature at the mouth of the science target canyon – suggest paleo stratigraphic surfaces that dip outward at an angle steeper than the banding. The banding continues across these resistant horizons and other geomorphic surfaces without interruption, supporting the inference that it is overprinted onto dipping stratigraphy within Mt Sharp. Previously, we have identified at least three lake levels associated with major valley network fans/deltas debouching into Gale through the crater’s rim. It may be possible to correlate these with specific bands or terraces along the outer margin of Mount Sharp, enabling volume estimates and relative timing of lake levels within the crater to be addressed.",

Some of these sites now have observation records that span several decades; from the early 1980s to present.\nAt the same time, Arctic temperatures have increased at double the rate of the global average increase. A recent comparison of\nmodels of CH4 emissions from wetlands (the “WETCHIMP” study) found that many models predict increased emissions in\nresponse to higher temperatures. Given the temperature sensitivity of the wetland emission models, and the observed\nArctic temperature increase, the change in annual CH4 emissions is likely small, however, the cumulative extra emissions\nover this period may be at the detection level of the atmospheric network. Even so there is still no firm evidence from the\natmospheric network that emissions are changing.\nIn this study, we explore the sensitivity of the atmospheric network to changing emissions. How large do the emissions have to be\nbefore they can be seen in the network observations? Can changes be detected by using spatial gradients of observed methane?\nCan changes in the amplitude and phase of the annual cycle be used to detect increasing emissions during the growing season?\nFurthermore, by using atmospheric assimilation techniques, network observations provide a strong constraint on total Arctic emissions.\nUsing results from a suite of atmospheric CH4 assimilations we show that total emissions from the Arctic are ~25 TgCH4/yr\n(with a range from 18 to 29 TgCH4/yr). This is lower than many bottom-up analyses, and implies that emissions from Arctic lakes, the\nEastern Siberian Arctic Sea, wetlands and possible geologic sources cannot all be accommodated in the Arctic atmospheric\nbudget of CH4. Finally, we address the issue of how the observation network can be augmented to allow timely trend detection.",

            "abstract": "We utilize (U-Th)/He analysis of apatite (AHe) and zircon (ZHe) to resolve cooling ages due to exhumation from those reset by geothermal fluids, and show that structural features play a role in the occurrence of geothermal anomalies. We also test the potential of 4He/3He thermochronometry to record fluid-induced reheating of recently exhumed samples. Dixie Valley is located within the Basin and Range province of Nevada where it forms a half graben east of the Stillwater Range normal fault. This region is characterized by extension, thinned crust, elevated heat flow, and high seismicity. Within Dixie Valley the complex interplay between the NE-trending Stillwater Range normal fault and NW-trending dextral faults produced several prominent dilational corners. These corners are hypothesized to result in increased fracture permeability, and often host blind geothermal prospects. Therefore, Dixie Valley is an ideal case study for applied thermochronometry. Samples (n=79) from the footwall of the normal fault yield AHe aliquots ranging from ~0.2-23 Ma and ZHe aliquots from ~1-146 Ma. Three elevation transects of AHe ages record advective cooling of the footwall due to exhumation onset at ~3-5 Ma. AHe data younger than this exhumation age (~0.2-4 Ma) show a strong correlation with previously identified geothermal anomalies and areas of increased strain, thus suggesting that ages are reset by fluids. Additionally, we use the 4He/3He method to measure the spatial distribution of 4He and to determine continuous t-T paths for individual apatite grains from ~70-20°C. The low-temperature sensitivity of the 4He/3He method makes it uniquely suited to address transient reheating by geothermal fluids. Dixie Valley and the Stillwater Range present an ideal opportunity to obtain empirical data regarding the temperature evolution of geothermal systems and develop a novel application of 4He/3He thermochronometry.",

            "abstract": "The external skeleton of mollusc bivalves, the shell, can furnish a recording of the environmental changes to which the organisms and population are exposed during their lives. The bivalve’s growth is subjected to the thermocline variability; which itself is affected by environmental and climatic events.\nA highly variable environment such as the Humboldt current system (HCS) requires tools capable of recording its variations over a wide range of periodicities. Upwelling, Coastal trapped waves (CTWs), El Niño Southern Oscillation, and Pacific decadal oscillation events contribute to this environmental and climatic variability. The thermocline depth is modified by these different events at their own time-scales (respectively, daily to weekly, intraseasonally, interseasonally to interannually, and on a decadal scale). The thermocline variation translates into changes in Sea surface temperature (SST) and in the qualitative and quantitative productivity of phytoplankton. These two environmental factors are critical to bivalve growth.\nThe sclerochronological (increment width) and sclerochemical (δ18O and δ13C) study consisted on the analysis of the Chilean bivalve Eurhomalea rufa, collected in 2005, as a recorder of the environmental HCS variability. The calibration step identified daily, monthly, and annual marks in the growth patterns of E. rufa. The results confirmed that the thermocline variability mainly drives the bivalve’s activity and led to the establishment of a paleotemperature equation. Moreover, periodogram and wavelet analyses exposed the respective impacts of each environmental event from daily to interannual periodicities. In particular, the growth pattern of E. rufa follows SST variability at an intraseasonal periodicity (~ 60 days) which is remotely induced by CTWs. CTWs are generated by Kelvin oceanic waves, which are formed primarily by eastward equatorial Pacific winds (e.g. Shaffer et al. 1997; Montecino and Lange 2009).\nSclerochronological studies on HCS bivalve shells can provide access to different periodicities, from daily to interannual. Studying shells of modern specimens can thus provide important information on bivalve growth parameters as well as on the variations and timescales of the surrounding environment such as SST and productivity.",

            "abstract": "We apply a suite of analysis methods, including statistical distribution and correlation, empirical orthogonal function (EOF), linear inverse modeling (LIM), and historical modeling using regional air quality and global chemistry-climate models, to analyze surface ozone (since 1980) and PM2.5 (since 2000) measurements from EPA observation networks. The overarching goal is to understand how regional climate and weather systems affect air quality trends and extreme events. Previous studies documented high or geographically specific ozone episodes and identified contributions from anticyclone, transport, or sub-decadal to decadal time scale patterns pertinent to the events. Here, an ensemble analysis of all events from single day to multi-day episodes in the past three decades places all episodes into a continuum of time and geospatial coordinates. Inter-annual patterns linked to source concentrations and seasonal transport are evident, but anomalies such as unseasonable and persistent anticyclones to winter events over snow cover can also be identified. Overlapping events between ozone and temperature extremes are identified. They tend to occur in eastern and western coast regions with significant local variability. The occurrence frequency of overlapping events decreased from 1980s to 2000s. PM2.5 extreme showed more sensitivity to extreme temperature than drought index. When being divided by two periods (2000-2004 and 2005-2009), the second period had more extreme PM events at lower temperature in winter time. An EOF analysis was conducted to examine how regional and hemispheric climate variability affects the ozone extreme events. A question explored here is how well EOF analysis that links ozone concentrations to climate variables explains the temporal and geospatial variability of extreme ozone events (days and episodes >= 75 ppbv). The seasonal change in controlling weather systems plays a key role in how regional climate affects air quality. We also show the feasibility of long-range (1 month) statistical forecasting of PM2.5. Lastly, regional and global model simulations were investigated to understand the mechanisms and identify required model improvements for simulating air quality extremes and trends.",

            "abstract": "Despite being a freshwater system, Green Bay in Lake Michigan, has many estuarine-like characteristics, including water mass exchange and the mixing between riverine inflow and the open lake. The bay has experienced excessive nutrient loading for decades resulting in hyper-eutrophic conditions and extensive algal blooms. Combined with a restricted, estuarine like circulation, this has resulted in the reoccurrence of late summer “dead zones” and wide spread bottom water oxygen concentrations below water quality standards. The onset of hypoxia is clearly related to thermal stratification which, in Green Bay, arises both from direct atmospheric forcing, i.e. low winds, high air temperatures, and increased solar radiation, and from indirect atmospheric forcing that drives circulation patterns resulting in the southerly incursion of cooler Lake Michigan bottom waters onto highly reducing organic rich sediment deposits. This circulation pattern can re-stratify a well-mixed water column within hours, and can set up stable stratified water column conditions that persist for days to weeks during which time sediment oxygen demand rates are sufficient to completely deplete hypolimnetic oxygen. Modeling hypoxia, therefore, is somewhat more complex than in a system which is driven largely or solely by seasonal thermal fluctuations. Understanding both the general circulation and the onset and duration of stratification in the bay are essential to determining the potential for hypoxic conditions to improve or worsen, particularly in the face of climate change projections of warmer conditions, less ice cover, and an earlier summer. Using D and O-18 isotopes in water, Rn-222, and dissolved methane as tracers we examine the relationship between river/lake mixing, transport rates and oxygen depletion in an attempt to verify the spatial and temporal scales of hypoxia in the bay, and estimate the potential impact of future climate change projections.",

While models forced by natural and anthropogenic forcings show a recent decline in sea ice extent and warming in sea surface temperatures, satellite observations show a puzzling redistribution of Antarctic sea ice and non-uniform surface warming trends. Studies with slab ocean models and observations have shown impacts of tropical teleconnections on variability in the Antarctic climate, but these teleconnections have yet to be thoroughly examined in coupled models. Here we examine the impact of tropical Pacific teleconnections to the Antarctic climate using the Community Earth System Model version 1.1. The 1980-2013 cooling trend in tropical Pacific SST’s is imposed by way of a prescribed heat flux adjustment, and an ensemble of simulations is constructed. The ensemble-averaged response is compared to a 30-member ensemble control run. Both ensembles use the rcp8.5 scenario for greenhouse gas forcing. We find that the response to combined tropical Pacific forcing and greenhouse gas forcing results in a regional expansion of Antarctic sea ice. In the event that the observed cooling trend in the tropical Pacific SST is a result of internal natural variability, our results suggest that natural variability in the tropical Pacific may account for some of the recent changes in Antarctic sea ice extent.",

            "abstract": "Feedbacks between hydrology, soil biogeochemistry, and primary productivity raise questions regarding the broader impact of human modifications to one or more of these critical zone processes. In particular, irrigation and nitrogen fertilization are used simultaneously to stimulate agricultural productivity and biomass export; however, together they may lead to unintended downstream consequences such as increased nitrogen leaching or greenhouse gas release. To quantify such trade-offs among ecosystem services and to identify optimal agricultural management practices, an ecosystem model coupling the water, carbon, and nitrogen cycles is studied. The model is forced by stochastic climate and periodic management interventions that include irrigation, fertilization, and harvest.\nSteady-state solutions of ecosystems under rotational harvest are developed, demonstrating that these ecosystems operate in a limit-cycle. Under constant fertilization and soil moisture conditions, the model predicts an optimal rotation length associated with maximum yield and maximum ecosystem nitrogen use efficiency. Through plant-soil feedbacks mediated by the harvest, intermediate rotation lengths promote short periods of immobilization, which stimulates mineral nitrogen retention. In these systems, increased soil moisture increases non-productive nitrogen losses, especially under long rotations, where mineral nitrogen availability is greatest. Time-variable water and nitrogen input scenarios are also considered and suggest the possibility of an optimal irrigation-fertilization strategy that balances productivity, which provides an economic benefit, and leaching, which may have consequences for aquatic ecosystems in receiving waters. These results highlight several soil C-N cycle responses to management practices that influence the provision of and trade-off between ecosystem services, namely primary productivity and mineral nitrogen export.",

Especially the attribution of observed extreme events, like hurricane Sandy, to climate change is often hotly debated. This can, however, be resolved in part for coastal flooding by evaluating the additional damage caused by the incremental increase in flood depth and extent from climate change-driven sea-level rise -- separate from the question of whether climate change contributed to the strength, path or origin of a storm. Here, we analyze Sandy by accurately simulating the observed flood with the ADCIRC model, and then simulating the same event but using a lower sea level. We find that in the absence of ~20cm of sea level rise caused by climate change, Sandy would have flooded significantly less land, houses and population, resulting in at least 10% less direct flooding damages in New York City than observed, translating into a difference in absolute terms in the billions of dollars.",

            "abstract": "The stratigraphic record of sinuous fluvial and deep sea channel deposits contains a wealth of information about formative sedimentary processes. For fluvial systems, deposits are considered in the context of processes observed in rivers, with the point bar facies model, as an example, representing a well-established linkage between process and product. A direct link has not been achieved in the deep sea as direct monitoring of coarse-grained sediment transport is challenging, exacerbated by the sporadic and infrequent nature of flows. Until a method for direct observation is developed and widely applied, the stratigraphic record of sediment transfer in the deep sea provides a critical perspective and unique insight into processes that shape not only ancient basin margin slopes, but also the present day seascape.\nDespite the obvious similarity in sinuous planforms of open, single thread fluvial and deep sea channels, outcrop characteristics, validated in many instances by experimental and theoretical work, indicate different processes. Meandering fluvial systems are most commonly represented by deposits that reflect point bar migration, a process whereby bank erosion and bar growth are genetically linked. At the bed scale, cross-stratification reflects bedload sediment transport and deposition by traction sedimentation. Single thread deep sea channel-fill strata are commonly characterized by sandstone-filled channelform bodies, which reflect both traction and suspension sedimentation. Heterolithic thin beds and cross-stratification can be locally preserved above channel bases and against channel margins, but the majority of depositional thickness comprises tabular sandstone turbidites that bi-directionally lap onto channel edges. The stratal record indicates a distinction between phases of channel maintenance (e.g., erosion, sediment bypass) and phases of substantial infilling with coarse-grained sediment – they are not contemporaneous. This is a key departure from processes known from meandering fluvial channels that should be considered in devising experiments and inputs for numerical models.",

The GEOS-Chem-APM, a global size-resolved aerosol model, can be considered as a representative AeroCom II model. In this study, multi-year AOD data (2004-2012) from ground-based remote sensing data AERONET as well as satellite retrievals MODIS, MISR and SeaWiFS are used to evaluate the performance of the GEOS-Chem-APM in capturing observed seasonal and spatial AOD variations. By incorporating a radiation transfer model, we then derive the anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing, and examine the dependencies of the radiative forcing on different affecting factors. We also investigate the anthropogenic contribution to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and associated first aerosol indirect radiative forcing using online aerosol–cloud–radiation calculation.\nThe aerosol direct and indirect radiative forcings derived from global modeling also differ substantially with satellite-based calculations. Therefore, we assess satellite-based direct radiative forcing and indirect radiative forcing by employing the cloud product from CERES SSF and AOD product from MODIS in combination with the fraction of anthropogenic aerosol optical depth obtained from model simulations using the GEOS-Chem-APM. A statistical relationship between planetary albedo and cloud properties, and, further, between the cloud properties and column aerosol concentration, which is required for the estimations, is derived from satellite retrievals. The uncertainties of both model simulations and satellite-based estimations are analyzed and comparisons in aerosol radiative forcing between simulations and satellite-based estimations are presented.",

Compared to older OAEs, the last Cretaceous OAE, the Coniacian-Santonian OAE 3 (~86 Ma), is more enigmatic and its driving mechanisms less well understood. In contrast to the nearly global OAE 2, OAE 3 was geographically limited to restricted basins and shallow seaways. Due to significant organic carbon burial, OAEs are traditionally identified by large, rapid positive carbon isotope excursions, whereas OAE 3 is characterized by a relatively muted carbonate positive carbon “plateau” that persists for ~3 myrs, which suggests significantly different carbon burial processes or paleoceanographic conditions.\nHere we present new high-resolution paired organic-inorganic carbon isotope records from the Niobrara Formation recovered in the USGS #1 Portland core from Cañon City Basin, Colorado. At the onset of OAE 3, there is a distinct decoupling of the organic and inorganic carbon isotope records. δ13Ccarb exhibits an abrupt ~1‰ positive isotope excursion at the onset of carbon burial superimposed on a larger ~2‰ isotope trend. Coeval with this shift, is a ~3‰ negative δ13Corg excursion. These results indicate that during OAE 3 in the Western Interior Seaway, while significant organic carbon was being buried, organic carbon was depleted in 13C.

            "abstract": "In this work we improve and calibrate a hydro-glaciological model based on a simplified energy balance approach using the WEAP modeling platform for two catchments in the headwaters of the Maipo River Basin, in the Andes Mountains of Central Chile. The Morales Creek catchment includes the San Francisco glacier, a clean glacier occupying 7% of the catchment area. The Pirámide catchment holds the debris-covered Pirámide Glacier, which covers 20% of the catchment area. Detailed field measurements have been carried out on both glaciers to characterize their melt and meteorological regimes. We calibrate an Enhanced Temperature Index melt model against ablation stakes and runoff measurements, and obtain clear differences between the optimal parameters for the clean and debris-covered glaciers. Calibrate melt threshold temperatures are 0,25 and 0,5ºC for the clean and debris-covered glaciers, respectively, while the fraction of net shortwave radiation employed for melting is 90 and 83% for clean and debris-covered glaciers, respectively. These results are coherent with an insulating effect of the debris cover at the Pirámide glacier. The hydrologic contribution of ice melt for the clean, San Francisco glacier is equivalent to 32% of total runoff measured at the Morales Creek outlet during the simulation period; on the other hand, ice melt accounts for 83% of total runoff estimated at the outlet of the Pirámide catchment over the same period. These results are part on an ongoing effort aimed at quantifying cryospheric contribution to the hydrology of the Maipo River basin, one of the key river basins in Chile, on the face of accelerated climate change, and is the first documented work to explicitly include debris-covered glaciers in a context of basin-wide hydrological modeling.",

            "abstract": "Urban agriculture provides a potential contribution towards more sustainable food production and mitigating some of the human impacts that accompany volatility in regional and global food supply. When considering the capacity of urban landscapes to produce food products, the impact of urban water demand required for food production in cities is often neglected. Urban agricultural studies also tend to be undertaken at broad spatial scales, overlooking the heterogeneity of urban form that exerts an extreme influence on the urban energy balance. As a result, urban planning and management practitioners require, but often do not have, spatially explicit and detailed information to support informed urban agricultural policy, especially as it relates to potential conflicts with sustainability goals targeting water-use. In this research we introduce a new model, CityCrop, a hybrid evapotranspiration-plant growth model that incorporates detailed digital representations of the urban surface and biophysical impacts of the built environment and urban trees to account for the daily variations in net surface radiation. The model enables very fine-scale (sub-meter) estimates of water footprints of potential urban agricultural production. Results of the model are demonstrated for an area in the City of Vancouver, Canada and compared to aspatial model estimates, demonstrating the unique considerations and sensitivities for current and future water footprints of urban agriculture and the implications for urban water planning and policy.",

            "abstract": "The application of laser technologies for high spatial resolution dating has proven to be an important advancement in (U-Th)/He thermochronology. Excimer laser microprobes have been used to successfully date high U+Th minerals and are an especially promising way to determine the distribution of (U-Th)/He zircon ages in detrital sedimentary samples. We have also found that another detrital mineral, titanite, may be amenable to this method as well. While titanite contains lower concentrations of parent isotopes than zircon, and consequently less radiogenic 4He, its typically larger grain size allows for these characteristics to be mitigated by the use of larger laser beam diameters during the ablation process. With the integrated use of ICPMS, an established method for U/Pb geochronology, this phase of the laser microprobe (U-Th)/He technique can be modified slightly to enable (U-Th)/He and U/Pb ‘double’ dating of detrital samples. Here we present a proof of concept study demonstrating the viability of integrated laser microprobe (U-Th)/He and U/Pb through dating Oligocene Fish Canyon tuff titanite and zircon from Colorado. Our use of a well characterized sample with established (U-Th)/He and U/Pb dates allows us to fully evaluate the utility of this technique. By selecting medium- to fine-grained crystals we are able to simulate a realistic, uni-modal detrital sample. Using our modified laser microprobe approach, we are able to reproduce the expected age modes with an analytical imprecision roughly twice that of more established methods, a difference that has little practical effect on geologic interpretations. Additionally, we believe that the technique could prove a viable method for double dating detrital rutile and apatite, so long as characteristically lower U+Th concentrations in these minerals are balanced by appropriately scaled ablation pits in an aliquot unbiased by the need for larger detrital grains. Ultimately, integrated laser microprobe U/Pb and (U-Th)/He dating of multiple detrital accessory minerals can be an exceptionally valuable tool for identifying sedimentary provenance and evaluating the exhumation history of a source region.",

            "abstract": "Very few long-term, continuous, high-resolution records of marine environmental conditions, such as seawater temperature and/or salinity, exist within the Arctic, hence, proxy-based records are needed to fully elucidate past marine climatic conditions. Our study uses the long-lived marine bivalve proxy, Arctica islandica, to investigate the impacts of large-scale climate variability on shell growth and geochemistry in northern Norway. A major goal of this work is to use the information stored in shell-based records as a proxy for regional ocean climate variability. The islands of Ingøy and Rolvsøy off northern Norway are located at the boundary between the Barents and Norwegian Seas, proximal to one of the main pathways of Atlantic water entering the Barents Sea, namely, the eastern branch of the North Atlantic Current. A master shell growth chronology constructed from nine shells documents 100 years of synchronous shell growth at Ingøy. Combining growth increment width and oxygen isotope data collected from annual increments yields an annually resolved, multi-proxy record of environmental conditions. A relatively strong inverse relationship (r = - 0.7) is observed between the shell-based multiproxy record and North Atlantic sea surface temperatures. The spatial pattern of correlation resembles that of the North Atlantic Current, indicating that large-scale ocean surface current dynamics play a role in regulating ecosystem processes and thus shell growth in northern Norway. This transfer function will serve the basis for hindcasting seawater temperatures from this location. Ongoing work includes the development of the master shell chronology for the past several centuries.",

            "abstract": "Subauroral Polarization Streams (SAPS) are important electromagnetic phenomena associated with geomagnetic storms that affect the inner magnetosphere and ionosphere. They are characterized by strong sunward plasma flows caused by poleward-directed electric fields in the region of the ionosphere equatorword of the auroral zone. To examine the effects subauroral electric fields have on ionosphere-thermosphere-magnetosphere coupling and magnetospheric convection we are developing an empirical model of the SAPS using data acquired by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), Dynamic Explorer 2, and Atmospheric Explorer C spacecraft, which have made decades of in-situ measurements of ionospheric ion drifts, composition, and precipitating auroral particles. These measurements will be used to characterize the latitudinal drift profiles, relative to the location of the auroral boundary, at varying magnetic local times and magnetic activity levels. As a critical component of this model, we have developed a model of the equatorword particle precipitation boundary of the auroral oval parameterized by AE and MLT, using boundary identifications derived from DMSP data. This will allow the incorporation of the empirical SAPS model into other global models, such as the Global Ionosphere Thermosphere Model. We will also use this model to perform a superposed epoch study of SAPS fields in relationship to the auroral boundary during selected geomagnetic storms as a function of storm phase. A global empirical model of SAPS electric fields of this kind is required to realistically model storm-time theremosphere-ionosphere coupling and inner-magnetospheric convection.",

            "abstract": "Freshwater resources are facing unprecedented pressures. In hope to cope with this, Environmental Hydrology, Freshwater Biology, and Fluvial Geomorphology have defined conceptual approaches such as “environmental flow requirements”, “instream flow requirements” or “normative flow regime” to define appropriate flow regime to maintain a given ecological status. These advances in the fields of freshwater resources management are asking scientists to create bridges across disciplines.\nHolistic and multi-scales approaches are becoming more and more common in water sciences research. The intrinsic nature of river systems demands these approaches to account for the upstream-downstream link of watersheds. Before recent technological developments, large scale analyses were cumbersome and, often, the necessary data was unavailable. However, new technologies, both for information collection and computing capacity, enable a high resolution look at the global scale. For rivers around the world, this new outlook is facilitated by the hydrologically relevant geo-spatial database HydroSHEDS. This database now offers more than 24 millions of kilometers of rivers, some never mapped before, at the click of a fingertip.\nLarge and, even, global scale assessments can now be used to compare rivers around the world. A river classification framework was developed using HydroSHEDS called GloRiC (Global River Classification). This framework advocates for holistic approach to river systems by using sub-classifications drawn from six disciplines related to river sciences: Hydrology, Physiography and climate, Geomorphology, Chemistry, Biology and Human impact. Each of these disciplines brings complementary information on the rivers that is relevant at different scales.\nA first version of a global river reach classification was produced at the 500m resolution. Variables used in the classification have influence on processes involved at different scales (ex. topography index vs. pH). However, all variables are computed at the same high spatial resolution. This way, we can have a global look at local phenomenon.",

            "abstract": "An unprecedented increase in earthquakes in the central and eastern US (CEUS) began in 2009. Many of these earthquakes have been documented as likely induced by wastewater injection. To better understand the likelihood of an induced seismic event from a given injection well, we compare the location and timing of earthquakes and injection operational parameters across the CEUS. We compiled a database of more than 187,000 injection wells in the CEUS, both active and inactive. In combination with the Advanced National Seismic System's (ANSS) comprehensive earthquake catalog from 1973 to mid-2014, we use spatial and temporal filtering methods to discriminate injection wells that may be associated with earthquakes from those that are not. Our goal was to understand whether or not well operational parameters such as injection rate, cumulative injected volume, injection pressure and injection depth affect the likelihood that a well is spatiotemporally associated with an earthquake.\nWe found more than 14,000 injection wells (~8% of all wells) that may be associated with earthquakes in the CEUS. Our spatiotemporal filter succeeded in capturing every suspected case of induced seismicity that we are aware of. We also found that the likelihood of an injection well being associated with an earthquake increased with increasing injection rate and cumulative injected volume. This phenomenon was observed over a wide range of geologic and hydrogeologic provinces in states such as Oklahoma, Colorado, New Mexico and Arkansas. Operational parameters such as injection pressure and injection depth do not show a clear trend towards an increased likelihood of spatiotemporal association with an earthquake.\nIn all, the cumulative number of CEUS earthquakes potentially associated with injection has risen sharply from 112 out of 545 in year 2000 (~19%) to more than 732 out of 1325 by May 2014 (~55%). This increase in earthquakes spatiotemporally associated with wells accounts for the vast majority of increased seismicity in the CEUS since 2009. Given that injection rate and total injected volume appear to affect the likelihood of wells being associated with earthquakes, industry or regulators can use injection parameters to lower the likelihood of earthquakes associated with injection wells.",

These factors consist of earth sciences (geology, geomorphology and soils), hydrology (runoff, sediment yield, infiltration and groundwater conditions) and socio-economic aspects (irrigated agriculture, flood damage mitigation, environment, job creation and so on). Hence, decision making depends on criteria of diverse nature. The goal of this study is defining a Decision Support System for floodwater site selection in Shahriary area. Four main criteria were selected in this research which are floodwater characters, infiltration, water applications and flood damage. In order to determine the weight of factors, Analytical Hierarchy Process was used. The results showed that soil texture and floodwater volume of infiltration are the most important factors. After providing output maps which had been defined in five scenarios, Kappa Index was used to evaluate the model. Based on the obtained results, the maps showed an acceptable agreement with control zones.",

            "abstract": "The JPL quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer presents an exceptional opportunity for combining cutting edge terrestrial geochemical research with the next generation of extraterrestrial science. The QIT is a small mass spectrometer that filters particles of different mass by electron ionization and subsequent separation with a quadrupole RF field. The latest version is capable of achieving very high resolution (R > 1000) without an increase in power consumption through the addition of a dipole RF to augment the primary quadrupole field. Crucially, we demonstrate the ability to achieve this resolution with high sensitivity (> 1014 cps/Torr), and at UHV without the addition of a cooling gas. In this mode, the high sensitivity and extremely low background allow the measurement of a large number of species in very small samples.\nMost laboratory instruments are too heavy, large, and energy-intensive to fly on spacecraft in their optimal forms. As a result, instruments for spaceflight have traditionally been heavily-modified versions of terrestrial instruments, designed to be lighter, smaller, and more efficient than their terrestrial counterparts, at the expense of analytical capabilities. The JPL QIT, in contrast, weighs less than 1 kg, is only a few cm in size, and consumes less than 30W. Only the accompanying UHV system and supporting electronics must be extensively redesigned for spaceflight, and NASA already possesses pumps capable of fulfilling this need. The opportunity for parallel development for terrestrial and extraterrestrial labs and the capability of direct comparison between planetary science and terrestrial geochemistry will benefit both fields.",

            "abstract": "Lake level changes and the associated water budget of closed lake basins are sensitive to climatic change. Although paleoshorelines around large lakes in Tibet were previously studied, reliable dating and surveying of these sequences of shorelines to reconstruct a detailed lake history in this region remain sparse. The rate of lake recession in response to paleoclimate changes remains poorly constrained. We have utilized flights of shoreline features with heights of up to 64 m above modern lake level within the Siling Co (lake) drainage basin to evaluate the history of the lake recession. Our results show that Siling Co underwent a continuous recession since ~ 4 ka from the Lingtong lake highstand (at ~ 4594 m in elevation). Simple calculations based on the history of these shorelines and the geometry of Siling Co lake basin suggest a systematic decrease in lake volume and surface area over the last 4 ka. Calculation of a ‘hydrologic index’ for closed lake basins (Mifflin and Wheat, 1979) suggests that historic lake levels reflect a decrease in effective moisture by a factor of 3 relative to the Middle Holocene lake highstand. The systematic recession of the lake likely reflects a progressive change in the water balance through time (rather than a protracted response to a step-function change). This is consistent with a weakening of the Indian Summer Monsoon. Our study shows how lacustrine shoreline archives can be used to quantify long-held inferences about the strength of the Indian Summer Monsoon.",

            "abstract": "The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the most prominent mode of tropical Pacific climate variability, significantly impacting both regional and global climate. In the past, the mean state of the Pacific Ocean has differed from today as evidenced by variability in the zonal water column structure. Recent paleoproxy based studies of tropical Pacific hydrology and surface temperature variability have hypothesized that observed climatological changes over the Holocene are directly linked to ENSO and/or mean state variability, complementing studies that dynamically relate centennial scale ENSO variability to mean state changes. These studies have suggested that mid Holocene ENSO variability was low and the mean state was more “La Niña” like. In the late Holocene, data have been interpreted as indicating an increase in ENSO variability with a more moderate mean state. Here, we test the hypothesis that observed climatological changes in the eastern tropical Pacific are related to mean state or ENSO variability during the Holocene.\nWe focus our study on three sediment core locations from the equatorial Pacific: the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (BJ803-119 GGC, 117MC), the Line Islands in the central Pacific (ML1208-18GC) and the Galapagos Islands in the Eastern Cold Tongue (KNR195-5 43 GGC, 42MC). These sites lie in regions poised to provide evidence of basin-wide equatorial water column structure changes in response to mean state and/or long-term ENSO variability. We use a multiproxy approach with data from both organic (sterol abundances) and inorganic proxies (Mg/Ca and δ18O of 4 planktonic foraminiferal species, % G. bulloides) to reconstruct zonal tropical Pacific (sub)surface temperature and stratification gradients over the Holocene. This approach enables us to combine the strengths of each individual proxy to derive more robust records. To put our data in the context of the broader Pacific and Indo-Pacific regions, we compare our new data to published records.",

            "abstract": "Extreme events such as tropical storms and typhoons are often the determining factor for the extreme values of wind, wave and water level conditions. The storm track, its propagation speed, the air pressure drop and the wind speed intensity of a typhoon determine the maximum occurring wave heights, water levels and currents. The stochastic behaviour of typhoons and tropical storms, however, lead to uncertainty in the extreme value analysis, because a slight variation of the typhoon track, propagation speed or wind speed intensity can have a significant impact on these local extreme hydrodynamic conditions.\nTo determine the significance of the stochastic behaviour of typhoons a model assessment is performed comparing standard extreme value analysis values of measured water levels (e.g. values of 1/10, 1/50, and 1/100 year return periods) against model results of artificial typhoons. In the model assessment, making use of Delft3D, various artificial typhoons are modelled in which the typhoon tracks, propagation speeds and wind speed intensities are varied within realistic ranges (based on observed historical typhoons). The study focusses on the Pearl River estuary (China) where typically about 5 to 10 tropical storms or typhoons are observed every year. Once every few years an extreme typhoon hits the area. By quantifying the potential impact of artificial typhoons the uncertainty in the extreme water level values in such a typhoon prone area are better assessed.\nThe model is validated simulating several historic typhoons. Subsequently the typhoons tracks, their propagation speeds and wind speed intensities are varied. The extreme water level values (extreme surge height + mean high water value) that follow from the artificial typhoon modelling are compared against values from a standard extreme value analysis, making use of the central limit theorem for the extreme values in a sample. A Peaks over Threshold approach is applied and the extremes are fitted and extrapolated according to a Generalized Pareto Distribution. One of our main conclusions is that while the peak surge heights and related total water levels resulting from the historical and synthetic typhoon simulations can exceed the once per 100 year extreme total water level estimates, they are generally within the 95% confidence interval of the estimate.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying ecosystem services is a crucial topic for land management decision making. However, market prices are usually not able to capture all the ecosystem services and disservices. Ecosystem services from rangelands, that cover 70% of the world’s land area, are even less well-understood since knowledge of rangelands is limited. This study generated a management framework for rangelands that uses remote sensing to generate state and transition models (STMs) for a large area and a linear programming (LP) model that uses ecosystem services to evaluate natural and/or management induced transitions as described in the STM. The LP optimization model determines the best management plan for a plot of semi-arid land in the Empire Ranch in southeastern Arizona. The model allocated land among management activities (do nothing, grazing, fire, and brush removal) to optimize net benefits and determined the impact of monetizing environmental services and disservices on net benefits, acreage allocation and production output. The ecosystem services under study were forage production (AUM/ac/yr), sediment (lbs/ac/yr), water runoff (inches/yr), soil loss (lbs/ac/yr) and recreation (thousands of number of visitors/ac/yr). The optimization model was run for three different scenarios – private rancher, public rancher including environmental services and excluding disservices, and public rancher including both services and disservices. The net benefit was the highest for the public rancher excluding the disservices. A result from the study is a constrained optimization model that incorporates ecosystem services to analyze investments on conservation and management activities. Rangeland managers can use this model to understand and explain, not prescribe, the tradeoffs of management investments.",

Though the comet is still in a state of relatively low-activity, its interaction with the solar wind causes plasma conditions different from standard solar wind characteristics. While Rosetta is still in the solar wind, the five plasma sensors of the Rosetta Plasma Consortium are currently investigating these cometary activity driven perturbations and plan to investigate, within the next few months, the close plasma environment of the comet. In this presentation, we show first observations and results obtained during the cometary approach phase and during the first orbits around the comet. Among the possible first signs of cometary activity that we shall discuss are distributions of pick-up ions possibly detectable by the Ion Composition Analyzer (RPC-ICA) and the Ion and Electron Sensor (RPC-IES), as well as ion cyclotron waves, generated by the pick-up process, which may be measured by the Fluxgate Magnetometer (RPC-MAG). Electron density and temperature measurements, and electric-field and waves measurements in the range from DC up to 3.5 MHz obtained by the Langmuir probes (RPC-LAP) and the Mutual Impedance Probe (RPC-MIP) will also be discussed.",

This salting out effect has important implications regarding the reactivity, transport and fate of organic compounds in atmospheric waters, particularly in aerosol particles because of the relatively large amount of salts present. However, very few studies have quantified the salting out effect of (NH4)2SO4. For the first time, we measured salting-out coefficients (or Setschenow constants) (KS [M-1]) for a large and diverse group of organic compounds in (NH4)2SO4 solutions at a wide range of salt concentrations, providing a reliable database for model development. KS values for (NH4)2SO4 are correlated with and always higher than KS for sodium chloride (NaCl), suggesting a higher salting-out effect of (NH4)2SO4. Three modeling approaches: a poly-parameter linear free energy relationship (pp-LFER), the quantum-chemical COSMOtherm software and the group contribution method AIMOFAC, were calibrated and evaluated in terms of their capability to predict KS. Relative merits of the prediction methods were identified. These models can be applied to estimate Setschenow constants for atmospherically relevant compounds involved in secondary organic aerosol formation based on chemical structure alone.",

Predicting the weather and climate in large cities is remains a challenge because there are diverse processes and factors that determine or influence atmospheric condition at various time and space scales. Consequently, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms of connection between local climate (influenced by urbanization) and those due to larger scales. The weather and microclimate over Santarém city in Amazonia is poor studied and monitored. The application of meteorological models, which representing the diverse atmospheric processes at the various scales, is essential, as e.g. WRF EMS model. The addition of spatial scale data is needed for validation of these models over cities. In this paper, we describe the application of the WRF EMS model (Weather Research and Forecasting) to represent the urban-scale atmospheric conditions (1km resolution) over the Santarem city. The model was validated against observed 2 meter air temperature obtained from several points and spatial rainfall over urbanized zones of Santarém. Thermal conditions and gradients of temperature over forested and non-forested zones were clear represented by the model. The WRF model reproduces well rainfall patterns around the urban area and Tapajós river-city contacts. The main results for this model test was the Improvements in the representation of the types of land cover-Land change from the mosaics structures on the city domain, what permit all errors/bias are reduced.",

            "abstract": "We present a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method that can be used to find the extents of creeping fault areas, an important input to seismic hazard models, from mechanical boundary element modelling of geodetic data. In our scheme, the surface of a partially-creeping fault is represented as a mesh of triangular elements, each of which is modelled as either locked or creeping (freely-slipping) using the boundary element code poly3d. Slip on the creeping elements of our fault mesh, and therefore elastic deformation of the surface, is driven by stresses imparted by semi-infinite faults beneath the base of the mesh (and any other surface faults) that slip at the geodetic slip rate of the faults. Starting from a random distribution of locked and unlocked patches, a modified Metropolis algorithm is used to propose changes to the locking state (i.e. from locked to creeping, or vice-versa) of randomly selected elements, retaining or discarding these based on a geodetic data misfit criterion; the succession of accepted models forms a Markov chain of model states. After a ‘burn-in’ period of a few hundred samples, these Markov chains sample a region of parameter space close to the minimum misfit configuration. By running multiple Markov chains, we can realise multiple such well-fitting models, and look for robustly resolved features (i.e. features common to a majority of the models, and/or present in the mean of those models).\nWe apply this method to a combination of persistent scatterer InSAR and GPS data covering the Hayward fault in northern California. Preliminary results show strong agreement between all models on the presence of regions of creep across the full down-dip extent of the fault at its northwest and southeast ends. The central portion of the fault, thought to be the source of the M~7 1868 Hayward earthquake, shows less consistent patterns. Most elements in this area are locked in around half of the models, with only a few locked in all models, indicating that the fault is likely partially locked here, and that multiple possible configurations of locked and creeping elements can fit the data approximately equally well. Additional observations, e.g. from surface creep measurements or characteristic repeating earthquakes, will be used to further refine these results in future.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the structure and state of hydration of the young Juan de Fuca (JdF) Plate prior to being subducted beneath Cascadia is important because water incorporated into the downgoing plate plays a critical role in many subduction zone processes. Here we present the structure of the JdF plate along a ~400-km-long wide-angle seismic profile extending from offshore Northern WA to offshore Central OR, ~10 km seaward from the Cascadia deformation front (CDF). Vp in the lower crust decreases from north to south: 7.0-7.1 km/s north of 46°N, and 6.85-6.95 km/s south of 45°30’N. Vp in the upper 2.5 km of the mantle is highest north of 46°50N (7.85-7.95 km/s) and south of the 45°N (7.85-8.1 km/s). In between these latitudes, mantle Vp is 7.75-7.85 km/s north of 45°45’N, and reaches a minimum value of 7.55 km/s at 45°15’N. MCS images across the southern part of the plate show evidence for faulting in the lower crust and upper mantle while images across the northern part of the plate do not [Han et al., this meeting]. Therefore we interpret the along-CDF variations in lower crustal and upper mantle velocity largely resulting from the increasing north-to-south effect of bending-related faulting. Taking into account plate age, inferred thermal structure, and expected mantle anisotropy, we explore end-member scenarios on the amount of fracturing and water stored in the lower crust and uppermost mantle of the JdF plate off the CDF. Assuming that Vp variations are due to fractures containing free H2O, we estimate that lower crust/upper mantle porosity increases from <0.1% north of 46°N to 0.15-0.25% to the south of this latitude, with free H2O content at these depths reaching a maximum of 0.08 wt% between 45°15’-30’N. At the other end of the spectrum, Vp variations may be explained by fractures filled-in with hydration products such as serpentine; in which case we estimate a porosity south of 46°N as large as 5-9%, with chemically-bounded H2O content reaching a maximum of 0.5-1.0 wt% between 45°15’-30’N. Since our thermal model predicts a temperature below the Moho of ~550 °C, which would severely limit the formation of serpentine, hydration of the JdF plate is probably better represented by an intermediate case in which both free and chemically-bounded water are present at lower crustal and upper mantle levels.",

This satellite flies the first 94 GHz spaceborne cloud profiling radar and the data collected has provided a unique perspective on Earth's cloudiness and processes that affect clouds. While passes of the nadir-pointing CPR antenna occur infrequently over tropical cyclones (TCs), they happen enough to provide a detailed compilation of the inner structure of clouds and precipitation of these complex storm systems. Over 8,000 vertical profiles of TCs have been collected during the period June 2006 through June 2014 and observations continue as CS flies in daylight only mode. Each unique overpass profiled by CS has been compiled with corresponding A-Train sensors, model data and storm specific best track information.\nWith the volume of data collected, it is possible to composite TC structure information with respect to various environmental parameters that are known to have a controlling influence on storms. To illustrate this characteristic of the data, we show composites of the vertical structure of TCs as a function of environmental wind shear. Observations of wind shear at varying levels (for example 200-850 mb) and TC composites relative to the direction of the larger scale shear will be examined and discussed in detail.",

            "abstract": "The compositions and volumes of basalts erupted at the earth’s surface are a function of mantle temperature, mantle composition, and the rate at which the mantle upwells through the melting zone. Thus, basaltic magmatism has long been used to probe the thermal and physiochemical state of the earth’s mantle. Great insight has been gained into the mantle beneath the global spreading ridge system, where the mantle source is assumed to be homogeneous peridotite that upwells passively [1]. However, it is now recognized that many basalt source regions are lithologically heterogeneous (i.e. containing recycled lithospheric material ranging from harzburgite to pyroxenite) and upwell at rates in excess of those governed by plate separation. To account for these complexities, we have developed a forward melting model for lithologically heterogeneous mantle that incorporates thermodynamically and experimentally constrained melting functions for a range of peridotite and pyroxenite lithologies. The model is unique because it quantifies mantle upwelling rates based on the net buoyancy of the source, thus providing a means for linking basalt compositions/volumes to mantle flow while accounting for source heterogeneity. We apply the model to investigate the mantle properties governing magmatism along different rift segments in Iceland, where lithologic heterogeneity and variable upwelling rates have been inferred through geochemical means [2,3]. Using constraints from seismically determined crustal thicknesses and recent estimates of the proportion of pyroxenite-derived melt contributing to Icelandic basalt compositions [4,5], we show that mantle sources beneath Iceland have excess potential temperatures >85 °C, contain <7% pyroxenite, and maximum upwelling rates ~14 times the passive rate. Our modeling highlights the dominant role of elevated mantle temperature and enhanced upwelling for high productivity magmatism in Iceland, and a subordinate role for mantle heterogeneity, which is required to account for much of the observed chemical and isotopic diversity.

            "abstract": "The routing of water, whether along lateral, near-surface flowpaths or vertically through peatlands, has profound implications for solute transport and budgets. Climate change, by altering hydrological connectivity of peatlands to surface and subsurface flow systems, may feedback on how various flowpaths and biogeochemical transformations affect solute concentrations in receiving waters. Such fundamental ecosystem changes may ultimately lead to shifts in solute yields from peatland catchments, ecosystem productivity, and carbon stabilization in northern peatlands. We are using piezometric, hydraulic conductivity, chemical, and isotopic data to assess how hydrological connectivity, solute sources, and biogeochemical transformations affect solute yields in northern Minnesota where connectivity to groundwater and surface water varies among a suite of fens and bogs. We are using geochemical mixing analysis to elucidate pathways along which water and solutes flow, and to determine how, when, and where solutes, such as dissolved organic matter, are transported from northern peatlands to downgradient aquatic ecosystems. From our assessment of contemporary connectivity of peatlands to larger flow systems, we are working to conceptualize how DOM yields from different peatland types may respond to climate change.",

In the north-east Pacific, Canadian as well as US efforts on building cabled seafloor observatories enable the scientific community to study the Cascadia margin gas hydrates at various locations independent of dedicated ship cruises and unstable weather, without power saving restrictions and with near realtime access to the data and the ability to influence the in-situ data acquisition in reaction to events.\nWe show scientific highlights from Barkley Canyon and Clayoquot Slope off Vancouver Island on of the gas hydrate stability and variability on and below the seafloor as well as gas release into the water column, using some standard measurements from core instruments such as temperature, salinity, bottom pressure, currents, as well as sonar, seismometer and camera image data. Correlations of these various data sets shed light on the dependence of the observed gas hydrate dynamics on various environmental factors, some still subject to debate and longer-term monitoring requirements. Global efforts on cabling the seafloor elsewhere are underway and an exciting future on gas hydrate research lies ahead.\nOcean Networks Canada invites the research community to participate, propose experiments, download data and collaborate (www.oceannetworks.ca).",

            "abstract": "The relationship between sediment transport processes, deposits, and channel morphology is well established for subaerial channel systems. Linking channel-fill patterns with planform morphology in submarine systems, however, is less constrained because of the difficulty in direct observation of sediment transport processes, including deposition of coarse-grained turbidites. Ever-increasing resolution of 3-D seismic-reflection and integrated bathymetry-sonar tools have led to significant improvement, but resolution issues still hinder effective analysis. For example, are inclined reflectors observed in seismic cross sections of channels associated with sinuous planforms indicative of turbidity-current-scale morphodynamics or are they composite surfaces that record larger-scale/longer-term evolution? Documenting the nature and variability of intra-channel fill architecture in outcropping submarine channel deposits provides insight into linking depositional processes and channel morphologies.\nThe Late Cretaceous retroarc foreland Magallanes Basin in southern Chile formed during uplift of the Andean Cordillera. Deep-water slope strata of the Tres Pasos Formation are exposed along a depositional-dip-oriented outcrop belt up to 2000 m thick and at least 100 km long. These strata provide an excellent natural laboratory for comparison of slope channel architectures from different positions on the slope and stages of basin infilling. We consider channelized architectural element dimensions and internal stratigraphic surface characteristics from multiple exposures along the outcrop belt. We also document varying stacking patterns of channel elements over time, from both laterally to vertically offset end-members. Results suggest that for both lateral and vertical channel stacking patterns, phases of accommodation generation (e.g., incision or sediment bypass) and migration of the channel are temporally distinct from phases of channel infilling (e.g., turbidity current collapse), which is an important difference compared to conceptual stratigraphic models of subaerial channel systems.",

            "abstract": "The hygroscopic behavior of atmospheric aerosols influences their optical and cloud-nucleation properties, and therefore affects climate. Although changes in particle size as a function of relative humidity have often been used to quantify the hygroscopic behavior of submicron aerosol particles, it has been noted that calculations of hygroscopicity based on size contain error due to particle porosity, non-ideal volume additivity and changes in surface tension. We will present a method to quantify the hygroscopic behavior of submicron aerosol particles based on changes in mass, rather than size, as a function of relative humidity. This method results from a novel experimental approach combining scanning transmission x-ray microscopy with near-edge x-ray absorption fine spectroscopy (STXM/NEXAFS), as well as scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) on the same individual particles. First, using STXM/NEXAFS, our methods are applied to aerosol particles of known composition ‒ for instance ammonium sulfate, sodium bromide and levoglucosan ‒ and validated by theory. Then, using STXM/NEXAFS and SEM/EDX, these methods are extended to mixed atmospheric aerosol particles collected in the field at the DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Research Facility at the Southern Great Planes sampling site in Oklahoma, USA. We have observed and quantified a range of hygroscopic behaviors which are correlated to the composition and morphology of individual aerosol particles. These methods will have implications for parameterizing aerosol mixing state and cloud-nucleation activity in atmospheric models.",

            "abstract": "Himalayan orogenesis is commonly explained by 1) extrusion models, involving expulsion of high-grade rocks southwards from beneath Tibet and up towards the High Himalayan orographic front, and/or 2) duplexing models, involving accretion of thrust horses from the downgoing Indian plate to the over-riding orogenic wedge. Most extrusion models predict exhumation and erosion of upper-amphibolite facies metamorphic rocks between the Main Central thrust (MCT) and a structurally higher normal fault, and therefore can be tested by determining if such high grade rocks occur between the MCT and the Indus-Yalu suture to the north. Prior qualitative studies suggest that such rocks are missing across the east Ladakh / Chamba and Kashmir regions of the western Himalaya. Here we present new quantitative and semi-quantitative results that document low peak metamorphic temperatures along a northeast-trending transect across the east Ladakh / Chamba Himalaya. We performed illite crystallinity (IC) and quartz grain boundary analyses to determine metamorphic and deformation temperatures, respectively. Calibrated IC values of structurally high samples range from 0.25 to 0.54, indicating temperatures of ~100 ˚C to ~300 ˚C. In structurally lower, muscovite +/- biotite-bearing meta-pelitic and meta-psammitic rocks, quartz grain boundaries show bulging recrystallization fabrics, corresponding to deformation temperatures of <~450 ˚C. Local exceptions occur along the southeast margin of the study region near a dome, where quartz sub-grain rotation fabrics indicate deformation temperatures between ~450 ˚C and ~550 ˚C. Our results, combined with similar IC values to the north from Girard et al. [2001, Clay Minerals v. 36, p. 237-247], demonstrate that a continuous strip of\n<~450 ˚C rocks extends from the MCT to the Indus-Yalu suture here. Therefore the predictions of extrusion models are not met in this portion of the Himalaya; we present alternative duplexing models.  ",

            "abstract": "The mechanical breakdown of rock by physical weathering represents a significant rate limiting step for erosion, sediment supply, chemical weathering, and atmospheric- and landscape- evolution across the globe. Yet, the primary drivers of physical weathering are poorly quantified. Recent work highlights the importance of solar-induced thermal stress as a key driver in physical weathering, particularly in mid-latitudes, but to date the role of climate in thermal stress cracking has not been extensively explored. Here we examine two long-term acoustic emission (AE) records of rock cracking in both a humid-temperate (North Carolina - 1 year of data ) and a semi-arid (New Mexico – 3 years of data) location. We use AE energy as a proxy for rock cracking. We compare on-site average ambient daily temperature for days in which cracking occurs to the average temperatures for those dates derived from climate records from the nearest weather stations. The range of temperatures for days on which cracking occurs is similar for both stations (-10 C to +30 C). The majority of cracking in both locations occurs on warm days (> 15 C). In the semi-arid climate, 73% of cracking occurs on hot days (> 20 C) while only 0.1% occurs on very cold days (-8 C to -3 C). In the humid-temperate climate, 21% of cracking occurs on hot days, while 17% occurs on cold days. When days during which cracking occurs are compared to climate averages, 81% (NC) and 51% (NM) of all cracking occurs on days with absolute temperature anomalies >1, regardless of the temperature. The proportion of cracking that occurs on anomalously hot or cold days rises to 92% and 77% when the data is normalized to account for uneven sampling of the days with extreme temperatures. We examine these results in the context of prior analyses of this dataset which indicates that the majority of cracking, even that occurring in freezing temperatures, is caused by thermal-stress processes. Here we attribute a majority of observed higher cracking rates on anonymously hot or cold days to the increased potential on those days for thermal stress-related fracture. An important hypothesis that arises from our work is that physical weathering rates in the critical zone will increase with increased temperature extremes.",

However, comparison of zircon U-Pb age spectra of soil and bedrock (Ayers and Katsiaficas, unpublished data) suggests that there is a small but significant exotic (externally derived) zircon component. Potential sources of exotic zircon include loess and alluvial sediments. In western Tennessee the Roxana Silt was deposited 38-53 ka and the Peoria Loess 18-25 ka. Detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology is a direct and effective way to test the possibility of loess as a contributor to the source material of the soil. According to Aleinikoff et al. (2008), loess from Colorado and Nebraska have young detrital zircon age peaks at ~34Ma. If this is also true for the loess in Tennessee, it may explain the ~33 Ma age peak found in one of the three studied soil samples. To identify the source of the exotic zircon found in middle TN soils, zircon age spectra will be measured for Roxana Silt, Peoria Loess, and alluvial sediments from the Harpeth and Cumberland Rivers. The loess samples were collected near Memphis, TN, while the alluvial sediments were collected near the soil sample sites.",

            "abstract": "Estimating the relative contributions of human withdrawals and climate variability to changes in groundwater is a challenging task at present. One method that has been used recently is a model-data synthesis combining GRACE total water storage estimates with simulated water storage estimates from land surface models. In this method, water storage changes due to natural climate variations simulated by a model are removed from total water storage changes observed by GRACE; the residual is then interpreted as anthropogenic groundwater change. If the modeled water storage estimate contains systematic errors, these errors will also be present in the residual groundwater estimate. For example, simulations performed with the Community Land Model (CLM; the land component of the Community Earth System Model) generally show a weak (as much as 50% smaller) seasonal cycle of water storage in semi-arid regions when compared to GRACE satellite water storage estimates. This bias propagates into GRACE-CLM anthropogenic groundwater change estimates, which then exhibit unphysical seasonal variability. The CLM bias can be traced to the parameterization of soil evaporative resistance. Incorporating a new soil resistance parameterization in CLM greatly reduces the seasonal bias with respect to GRACE. In this study, we compare the improved CLM water storage estimates to GRACE and discuss the implications for estimates of anthropogenic groundwater withdrawal, showing examples for the Middle East and Southwestern United States.",

Here, we demonstrate that the packing density (Φf) of compacted rigid aggregates is independent of spatial scale for systems under weak compaction, a regime that includes small solar system bodies.  The Φf of rigid aggregated structures across 6 orders of magnitude were measured using nanoscale spherical soot aerosol composed of aggregates with ≈ 17 nm monomeric subunits and aggregates made from uniform monomeric 6 mm spherical subunits at the macroscale. We find Φf = 0.36 ± 0.02 at both the nano- and macroscale. These values are remarkably similar to qf observed for comet nuclei and measured values of other rigid aggregated systems across a wide variety of spatial and formative conditions. We present a packing model that incorporates the aggregate morphology and show that Φf is independent of both monomer and aggregate size. These observations suggest thatqf of rigid aggregates is independent of spatial dimension across varied formative conditions ranging from interstellar space to pharmaceutical manufacturing.",

Dust devils also cause surface erosion and change in surface albedo which impacts radiative energy budget. Thus there is a need for parameterizing dust devil impacts in Martian climate models. In this context it is important to understand environmental conditions that are favorable for formation of dust devils on Mars and associated implications for diurnal, seasonal, and geographical variation of dust devil occurrence. On earth, prior studies show that thresholds of ratio of convective and friction scale velocities may be used to identify boundary layer regimes that are conducive to formation of dust devils. On earth, a w*/u* ratio in excess of 5 is found to be conducive for formation of dust devils. In this study, meteorological observations collected during the Viking Lander mission are used to constrain Martian boundary layer model simulations, which is then used to estimate w*/u* ratio. The w*/u* ratio is computed for several case days during which dust devil occurrence was detected. A majority of dust devils occurred in convective boundary layer regimes characterized by w*/u* ratios exceeding 10. The above described analysis is being extended to other mars mission landing sites and results from the extended analysis will also be presented.",

            "abstract": "Changing tephra concentration in volcanic eruption columns is difficult to measure in the field due\nto fluid opacity. The bulk fluid erupted may be higher density than the surrounding atmosphere at\nthe vent and then transition to positive buoyancy through the ingestion and heating of ambient air;\nthus, the concentration of the plume fluid as it rises is critical to determining whether the material\nrises in a sustained plume or collapses into a pyroclastic density current. We evaluate the changing\nconcentration of an analogue plume via tracer dye intensity and relate it to plume radius expansion and\nvent distance. To calibrate our concentration metric, we calculated the density and dye concentration\nof pre-determined tracer-water mixtures. The density of the solution was directly measured using a\nmicropipette and high precision balance. The calculated density falls within the standard error of the\nmeasured density for each step. Five photographs were taken of each concentration using a mounted\nEx-FH100 digital camera with identical lighting. Using a MATLAB script, the RGB (Red-Green-Blue) color\nvalue was extracted from five pixels located at the same coordinates in each image, confirming that\nthere was no inherent error caused by the camera and that the RGB value was the same across an\nentire image. We created a color map to convert from the RGB color value of a pixel in an image to\nits corresponding concentration. This method algorithm can then be applied to an analogue volcanic\ntank model, using the color variations in the plume eddies to determine the tracer concentration, and\nthereby density distribution, in the plume.",

            "abstract": "Although there are about 2100 rain gauges all over India only monthly rainfall data are made available to the public due to various reasons. Poor data collection network and difficulty to access the data, lack of motivation and dedication on the part of the data collection and monitoring agencies and lack of appreciation of the cost of water by the general public were identified to be key barriers to effective management of water in a low income country like India through the literature review and interview with twenty-four key stakeholder institutions that deals directly or indirectly with water in India.\nOne of the solutions to this challenge could be to crowdsource the collection of rainfall, humidity and temperature data to at least one school each in every district of the about 675 districts in the country. The data could be uploaded to a single website either through text messages or internet under the supervision of a school teacher on a daily basis. The data collected could be accessed by researchers and decision makers in cases of emergencies like floods and droughts.\nBesides improving the data collection and quick dissemination of data this could motivate school children to value their laboratory practices as they can see the immediate benefits of their sincere laboratory works and at the same time motivate the larger community to value water and the impact of quality data. The same could be applied for prevention of water quality related epidemics if water quality data and healthcare data can be simultaneously collected and correlated.",

            "abstract": "Radial anisotropy provides important constraints on mantle deformation. While its presence is well accepted in the uppermost mantle, large discrepancies remain among existing models, even at depths well sampled by seismic data, and its presence at greater depths is highly uncertain. Surface wave phase velocity dispersion measurements are routinely used to constrain lateral variations in mantle S-wave velocity (dlnVS) and radial anisotropy (ξ=VSH2/VSV2). Here, we employed the fundamental and higher mode surface wave phase velocity maps of Visser et al. (2008) that have unprecedented sensitivity to structure down to 800-1000km depth, and we adopted a probabilistic forward modeling approach, the Neighbourhood Algorithm, to quantify posterior model uncertainties and parameter trade-offs.\nWe investigated the effect of prior crustal corrections on 3-D ξ and dlnVS models. To avoid mapping crustal structure onto mantle heterogeneities, it is indeed important to accurately account for 3-D crustal anomalies and variations in Moho depth. One approach is to solve the non-linear problem and simultaneously constrain Moho depth and mantle anomalies (Visser et al., 2008). Another approach, taken here, is to calculate non-linear crustal corrections with an a priori crustal model, which are then applied to the phase velocity maps before inverting the remaining signal for mantle structure. In this work, we also determined laterally varying sensitivity kernels to account for lateral changes in the crust. We compare models obtained using CRUST2.0 (Bassin et al., 2000) and the new CRUST1.0 (Laske et al., 2012) models, which mostly differ under continents. Our preliminary results show strong differences (ΔdlnVS>2%) between the two models in continental dlnVS for the upper 150-200km, and strong changes in x amplitudes in the top 200km (Δξ>2%). Some of the differences in ξ persist down to the transition zone, in particular beneath central Asia and South America. Despite these discrepancies, inferences on the depth of continental roots (~200-250km) based on either the extent of the dlnVS>0 anomalies or the depth at which ξ changes sign remain independent of the crustal model employed. We also note that VSV>VSH dominates the deep upper mantle except in central Pacific, which is characterized by VSH>VSV down to the transition zone.",

Concentrations of this pollutant are significantly influenced by precursor gas emissions, many of which emanate from energy production and use processes. Energy system optimization models could inform policy decisions that are intended to reduce these harmful effects if the contribution of precursor gas emissions to human health and ecosystem degradation could be elucidated. Nevertheless, determining the degree to which precursor gas emissions harm ecosystems and human health is challenging because of the photochemical production of ozone and the distinct mechanisms by which ozone causes harm to different crops, tree species, and humans.\nHere, the adjoint of a regional chemical transport model is employed to efficiently calculate the relative influences of ozone precursor gas emissions on ecosystem and human health degradation, which informs an energy system optimization. Specifically, for the summer of 2007 the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model adjoint is used to calculate the location- and sector-specific influences of precursor gas emissions on potential productivity losses for the major crops and sensitive tree species as well as human mortality attributable to chronic ozone exposure in the continental U.S. The atmospheric concentrations are evaluated with 12-km horizontal resolution with crop production and timber biomass data gridded similarly. These location-specific factors inform the energy production and use technologies selected in the MARKet ALlocation (MARKAL) model.",

            "abstract": "Lateral subsurface flow can be critical to understanding the spatial soil moisture availability to plants, and when, where, and how drought are influencing individual plants. The concentration of intensive aspen damage in certain hillslopes with higher temperature and lower soil moisture suggests that soil augmentation/reduction from lateral redistribution could help explain the survivability of some aspen through its influence on soil water availability during drought. It remains unclear how lateral water redistribution helps to limit hydraulic impairment of aspen located in different topographic positions during a drought event. This study employed an integrated ecohydrology model, TREES, combining plant-water balance and canopy physiology, to examine the potential effects of lateral flow on hydraulic and metabolic performance of aspen, by exposing trees to a set of soil water conditions associated with different levels of water stress. Sap flux, soil moisture, meteorological and plant hydraulic data from aspen trees in Colorado that died (SAD) and those that lived were used to parameterize the model. Our goal was to quantify the extent to which lateral flow explained sudden aspen dieback. The results indicate that the predisposition of tree mortality is related to the level of soil water augmentation. A reduction of 30% soil water content could introduce 21.55% increase in the loss of hydraulic conductivity (PLC), 23.6% loss in canopy transpiration, 21.7% loss in GPP. It would also cause the frequency of greater than 50% PLC to increase from 42.1% of the time to 51% of the time, and the frequency of hitting the 88% PLC pressure to increase from 11% to 14% of the time. On the other hand, an augment of 30% soil water content could introduce 20.2% reduction in PLC, 16.4% gain in canopy transpiration, 16.5% gain in GPP. The frequency of greater than 50% PLC is reduced to 31% of the time and the frequency of hitting the 88% PLC pressure is reduced to 6% of the time. This result suggests that water augmentation or reduction due to topographic control can be critical for survival or mortality of individual under extreme conditions. The result of this study has implications for coupling lateral flow with plant hydraulics and extending tree mortality simulations to landscape scale.",

            "abstract": "In Arctic ecosystems, climate-driven changes to the thermal regime of permafrost soils have the potential to create surface disturbances that influence vegetation dynamics and underlying soil properties. Disturbance-mediated changes in vegetation are important because vegetation and the accumulation of soil organic matter drive ecosystem carbon (C) dynamics and contribute to the insulation of soils and protection of permafrost from thaw. We examined the effect of two disturbance types—thermokarsts and frost boils—to determine disturbance effects on the vegetation community and soil properties in northeast Siberia. In summer 2014, we measured vegetation cover, soil moisture, soil temperature, and thaw depth in two thermokarst sites within boreal forests, two frost boil sites in tundra, and in adjacent undisturbed sites within both ecosystems. Both thermokarst and frost boils resulted in decreased vegetation cover and greater exposure of mineral soils (10-40% bare soils vs. 0% in undisturbed), and consequently, 2-3 times higher soil temperature and deeper thaw depth. Compared to undisturbed areas, soil moisture was 3-4 times higher in thermokarst areas but 1.2-2 times lower in frost boil areas, which reflected differences in microtopography between these two disturbance types. In both thermokarst and frost boil disturbed areas, deciduous and evergreen shrubs covered only 5 and 10%, respectively, compared to approximately 10 and 20%, respectively, in undisturbed areas. In general, graminoids were substantially more abundant (2-20 times) in disturbed areas than in those undisturbed. These results highlight important linkages between disturbances, vegetation communities, and permafrost soils, and contribute to our understanding of how changes in arctic vegetation dynamics as direct and/or indirect consequences of climate change have the potential to impact permafrost C pools.",

Recent launches of the SAC-D/Aquarius and SMOS satellites have provided near real-time snapshots of global ocean sea surface salinity (SSS). Changes in SSS over time and space have shown to be a direct reflection of changes in our global hydrological cycle. In addition, salinity is an important component of ocean circulation. This study attempts to advance our understanding of interannual changes in SSS by looking at year to year changes in the seasonal cycle over the past decade. We utilize near-surface salinity data from the World Ocean Database (WOD) to compute gridded monthly SSS fields from January 2004 through December 2013. The WOD includes Argo salinities along with other salinity profile data which augment Argo data. In addition to in situ derived monthly analyses, level-3 monthly data from SMOS and Aquarius are also utilized for the 2010-2013 and 2012-2013 calendar years, respectively. For each calendar year (2004-2013), a Fourier decomposition is applied and the first and second harmonics are examined for year to year changes in salinity. Additionally, interannual SSS variability is correlated to multiple climate indices (ENSO, NAO, etc.) over the past decade.",

Sediments recovered from IODP Site U1396 (16.51°N, 62.45°W) contain a 140 m sequence of hemiplegic sediment and intercalated tephra related to the evolution of the Lesser Antilles volcanic arc. Shipboard measurements of the NRM demagnetized at 20mT documented 17 polarity reversals dating back ~4.5Myrs with magnetic susceptibility (MS) efficient at identifying the visible tephra. These initial results suggested Site U1396 presents a rare, low-latitude, sedimentary magnetic record stretching back into the Gilbert chron. After developing a composite depth scale for the site, we sampled the continuous splice with u-channels to improve the 2.5cm shipboard resolution. Centimeter scale u-channel measurements of MS, NRM AF demagnetized in 12 steps between 20-80mT, and ARM were accompanied by hysteresis measurements of discrete samples to assess lithologic variability, establish the magnetic carriers and quality of the geomagnetic signal, refine the shipboard magneto-stratigraphic reversal record, and derive an estimate for relative paleointensity (RPI). Magnetic mineralogy is dominated by PSD-MD size ferrimagnetic minerals and MS efficiently discriminates sub-cm scale tephra that can drive lithologic variances in the NRM from the carbonate dominated hemipelagic sediment. Maximum angular deviation (MAD) values range from < 1° to > 40° in volcanogenic deposits, though 5-10° are more representative of hemipelagic intervals whose average values are lower in the Pliocene than the Pleistocene. Inclination varies around GAD predictions for both polarities which alongside azimuthally orientated declination establishes the refined reversal based age model. Pliocene sedimentation rates (~4 cm ky-1) are twice that of the Pleistocene and MS reveals a greater Pliocene eruption frequency potentially identifying a behavioral change in the volcanic history of the arc. The NRM was normalized by ARM and MS to generate estimations of RPI. Comparison to ODP Site 983 shows preservation of similar directional and intensity features through the B/M boundary while lower Pliocene MAD values and the accompaniment of older reversals with RPI lows reinforces our geomagnetic interpretation back into the Gilbert.",

            "abstract": "The EarthScope USArray provides an opportunity to obtain detailed images of the continental upper mantle of United States at a novel scale. The majority of mantle models derived from USArray data contain spatial variations in velocity; however, little is known about the attenuation structure of the North American upper mantle. Joint interpretation of seismic attenuation and velocity models can improve upon the interpretations based only on velocity, and provide important constraints on the temperature, composition, melt content, and volatile content of the mantle.\nIn this study, Rayleigh wave travel time and amplitude are measured using an interstation cross-correlation version of the Generalized Seismological Data Functional algorithm, which takes advantage of waveform similarity at nearby stations. Our data are from 670 large teleseismic earthquakes that occurred from 2006 to 2014 and were recorded by 1,764 Transportable Array stations. More than 4.8 million measurements at periods between 20 and 100 s are collected into our database. Isolating the signal of attenuation in the amplitude observations is challenging because amplitudes are sensitive to a number of factors in addition to attenuation, such as focusing/defocusing and local site amplification. We generate several Rayleigh wave attenuation maps at each period, using several different approaches to account for source and receiver effects on amplitude. This suite of attenuation maps allows us to distinguish between the robust features in the maps and the features that are sensitive to the treatment of source and receiver effects. We apply Helmholtz surface-wave tomography (Lin et al., 2012) to determine velocity and attenuation maps.\nA significant contrast in velocity and attenuation is observed in the transition between the western and central United States along the Rocky Mountain front. We find low Q values in the western US, along the eastern coast, and the Gulf plain. These areas are also characterized by low wave speed in the phase-velocity maps. The lateral variations in Q may indicate possible temperature variations in the upper mantle of the continental interior. Our Q maps in the western US show good agreement with those presented by Lin et al. (2012). Both models contain low Q (< 100) beneath the Colorado Plateau and the West Coast for 60 s.",

            "abstract": "Recent work shows, both theoretically and empirically, that river networks fed by subsurface flow bifurcate on average at an angle of 2π/5 [1]. However, the network's existence within a complex natural framework obscures the emergence of this pattern. Fortunately, this ambiguity betrays the presence of processes that have had some effect on the channels during the network's long history. In particular, we concern ourselves with the signature of the third dimension - the topographic relief - on the early stages of channel bifurcation. While, on average, channels grow in a direction dictated by the shape of the groundwater table, we hypothesize that the valley relief plays a crucial role in determining the opening angle and its relaxation to 2π/5 in this regime. A network-wide averaging of several thousand channel bifurcations driven by subsurface flow on the Florida Panhandle reveals that rivers on average branch initially at an angle wider than 2π/5, yet quickly relax to 2π/5 after a few meters. We hypothesize that this initial wide growth direction is governed by the shape of the topography. As these channels form independent valleys, the Laplacian field prevails, yielding an emergent 2π/5 branching angle. Our results therefore suggest that the path-selection of incipient channels fed by subsurface flow is coupled both to the local topography and the surrounding groundwater field.\n1.

            "abstract": "The United States summer of 2012 is remembered for record-breaking heat and devastating drought. This summertime heat and drought, however, was preceded by a heat wave in March—the March heat wave event saw a 3.7σ increase from 1948-2012 average temperature, while the July maximum saw a 2.5σ increase—that led to soil moisture depletion entering the summertime growing season. The July event was also notably difficult to predict and even to simulate in standard models. To explain this, some researchers have categorized the July event as a flash drought that was triggered by rapidly evolving dryness in the immediate lead-up to the event. Others have hypothesized that longer-term soil moisture memory played a role, where the March event was a large factor in the July event. Here we present results from controlled simulations with the NASA-Unified Weather Research and Forecasting Model (NU-WRF) in which we explore the roles of soil moisture memory and land-atmosphere coupling in the evolution of the July extreme, with a focus on near-surface air temperature. NU-WRF coupling to the Land Information System (LIS) is utilized to perform experiments with and without land coupling, with neutral versus observed initial conditions at the onset of the July event, and with lower boundary conditions prescribed to match observed 2012 anomalies or climatology. These simulations allow us to quantify the role of the land surface in driving high temperatures in 2012 and to identify mechanisms involved in land-atmosphere coupling during hot and dry extremes.",

            "abstract": "Predicted changes to California’s climate over the coming decades are expected to affect distribution, timing, and type of precipitation. This shift in timing and amount of water, particularly that originating from mountain sources, will affect the hydrology of the intensively farmed Central Valley and reliability of supply for growing urban areas on the coast and in the valley. Previous studies have assessed potential impacts of future climate scenarios on Sierra mountain and central valley hydrology through GCM-LSM coupling as well as lumped and semi-distributed hydrologic models. However, little work has been done to simulate the propagation of potential climate change impacts through the full hydrologic system at a refined spatial and temporal resolution in a manner that fully captures the mechanistic interconnection between the surface and subsurface. The integrated hydrologic model ParFlow, coupled with the land surface model CLM, is used in this study to evaluate the impact of changed climate scenarios (derived from CMIP5 datasets) over the San Joaquin basin in central California at 1 km horizontal resolution. Simulation results allow diagnosis of impacts to critical water budget components including streamflow, groundwater-surface water exchange, and valley recharge.",

            "abstract": "Dissolved organic copper-binding ligands were examined on the U.S. GEOTRACES zonal transect in the Eastern Tropical South Pacific from Peru to Tahiti. All samples were measured using competitive ligand exchange-adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry (CLE-ACSV), and a subset were analyzed using multiple competition strengths of the added ligand salicylaldoxime (1, 2.5, 5, 10, and 25 µM). Titration data was processed using newly available multiple analytical window data processing techniques, which unify the multiple window dataset as a whole. Multiple competition strengths of the added ligand enabled the detection of an additional weaker class of copper-binding ligand, compared to the two stronger ligand classes which have been measured previously in the open ocean. The strongest ligand class (L1) ranged in concentration from 1-10 nmol L-1 and had a conditional stability constant (logK) ranging from approximately 15.0-16.0. The weaker ligand classes (L2, and L3) were present in much higher concentrations even in surface waters, with concentrations ranging from 5-50 nmol L-1 and conditional stability constants ranging from 8.6-12.5. The elevated ligand concentrations, both in surface and deep waters, lead to extremely low concentrations of Cu2+ throughout the transect, possibly influencing important biogeochemical processes such as inducible iron acquisition by diatoms, and ammonium oxidation in the oxygen minimum zone.",

            "abstract": "Modern ground-based remote sensing methods offer a unique opportunity to provide long-term observations of precursors to ozone formation, specifically NO2 and Volatile Organic Carbons (VOCs), with good spatial and temporal resolution. Among those methods, Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) has become a popular technique for measuring atmospheric trace gases using narrow-band absorption features of gas molecules along a light path through the atmosphere. The UCLA Multi-Axis DOAS instrument (MAX-DOAS) is a ground-based spectrometer currently located at Mt. Wilson, California (1700 meters above sea level). Since May of 2010, it has been taking regular measurements of atmospheric pollutants in the boundary layer of the atmosphere in and above the Los Angeles Basin. We will present results from four years of measurements of NO2 and HCHO from Mt. Wilson, and discuss some of the techniques developed specifically for taking long term measurements from a fixed mountaintop location above an urban atmosphere. The advantages of a mountaintop measurement strategy will be discussed in light of the amount of vertical information that can be retrieved from this approach. The methodology developed to retrieve vertical concentration profiles from these observations using radiative transfer models and a combination of linear and nonlinear inverse modeling techniques will be described. We will discuss the observed path-integrated column densities of NO2, HCHO, and O4 (as proxy of aerosol extinction) and our retrievals of vertical trace gas concentration and aerosol extinction profiles. A first practical application of these observations uses the ratio of HCHO/NO2 to study the dependency of ozone formation on nitrogen oxides and VOCs.",

            "abstract": "Global mascon solutions of Earth’s time-variable surface mass distribution have been introduced in recent years as new products enabling geodetic studies of GRACE observations. One such product, developed at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), derives 1-degree equal-area mascons using spatial constraints in conjunction with regional boundaries to capture signal within appropriate regions and quantify a global solution. In this study, a rigorous statistical analysis is conducted seeking improvements to the spatial regularization methods employed in creating the constraints used by this product. Until now, these solutions have applied an exponential weighting model within regions and no correlation between differing regions in deriving mascon values. This work explores alternatives to this spatial regularization technique. A statistically driven study of additional regularization methods is conducted in an effort to extract more signal and reduce noise in the GSFC product. Additionally, alternative region definitions are explored to both assess their impact on the global solution and investigate regions that have not been specifically addressed by the product in previous studies. This report serves as a summary of initial findings by the study, analyzing potential improvements to the spatial regularization technique as well as multiple newly investigated regions. Mascon solutions utilizing these potential changes are presented in comparison to the current product, and impacts of these changes are quantified and illustrated. Future work to be investigated is presented based on these initial findings.",

            "abstract": "Bottle sampling is a convenient method of obtaining suspended sediment measurements for the development of sediment budgets. While these methods are generally considered to be reliable, recent analysis of depth-integrated sampling has identified considerable uncertainty in measurements of grain-size concentration between grain-size classes of multiple samples. Point-integrated bottle sampling is assumed to represent the mean concentration of suspended sediment but the uncertainty surrounding this method is not well understood. Here we examine at-a-point variability in velocity, suspended sediment concentration, grain-size distribution, and grain-size moments to determine if traditional point-integrated methods provide a representative sample of suspended sediment. We present continuous hour-long observations of suspended sediment from the sand-bedded portion of the Fraser River at Mission, British Columbia, Canada, using a LISST laser-diffraction instrument. Spectral analysis suggests that there are no statistically significant peak in energy density, suggesting the absence of periodic fluctuations in flow and suspended sediment. However, a slope break in the spectra at 0.003 Hz corresponds to a period of 5.5 minutes. This coincides with the threshold between large-scale turbulent eddies that scale with channel width/mean velocity and hydraulic phenomena related to channel dynamics. This suggests that suspended sediment samples taken over a period longer than 5.5 minutes incorporate variability that is larger scale than turbulent phenomena in this channel. Examination of 5.5-minute periods of our time series indicate that ~20% of the time a stable mean value of volumetric concentration is reached within 30 seconds, a typical bottle sample duration. In ~12% of measurements a stable mean was not reached over the 5.5 minute sample duration. The remaining measurements achieve a stable mean in an even distribution over the intervening interval.",

            "abstract": "Precipitation biases over Southern Asia persist in atmospheric general circulation models (AGCM) when compared to various observational data sets. It has been hypothesized that high-resolution modeling is key to reducing these biases. Here we compared a suite of high to low-resolution simulations (~0.25 to ~ 2.0) using Community Earth System Model version 1.0 (CESM1) to show that these features are consistent across the range of resolutions.\nWe find that the general spatial distribution of precipitation over the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, and Central Asia stay relatively consistent as we increase model resolution. For instance, orographic precipitation over the Himalayan front and the exceedingly strong signal from the Somali Jet are the two most prominent and robust features we find in the model. Furthermore, we used the CESM’s recent modified AGCM, Community Atmospheric Model version 5 (CAM5) with two model resolutions (1.0 and 2.0). Despite the improved formation of cloud condensation nuclei through the new parameterization of direct and indirect aerosol interactions, we find that the features mentioned above continually persist throughout both simulations.\nBoth orographic precipitation over the Himalayan range and the Somali jet are slightly improved in our ~0.25 simulation, although the zonal average profile of precipitation over Asia consistently shows two maximum peaks one near the tropics and another in the subtropics that are not seen in both observational data sets Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). We also find the magnitude of these peaks to be greater than the observations. However, hi-resolution observations also show different precipitation patterns especially over the Arabian Sea and Central Asia. To evaluate the sensitivity of the model-data mismatch, we will utilize hi-resolution rain gauge (APHRODITE) and satellite observation (CMAP) data sets, and discuss the implication of these different data sets for the interpretation of model accuracy.",

Despite this knowledge, the impact of wind shear on convection has largely been ignored at the scale of climate models due to a lack of observations. In leiu of these observations, convection-allowing simulations can be used to understand these relationships. Although these simulations are computationally expensive, several institutions maintain large databases of simulations run over the contiguous US in support of the NOAA Hazardous Weather Tesbed (HWT).\nMultiple years of daily simulations from NSSL and NCEP run in support of this project will be used to understand the relationship between wind shear and convective properties such updraft strength and area. It will be shown that in environments with weak instability, wind shear decreases convective area and strength for areas the size of climate model grids. When sufficient instability is present, however, both of these properties increase with wind shear. Although many of these results are consistent between the NSSL/NCEP simulations, some differences exist. These differences will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The land surface reflectance is a fundamental climate data record at the basis of the derivation of other climate data records (Albedo, LAI/Fpar, Vegetation indices) and a key parameter in the understanding of the land-surface-climate processes. It is essential that a careful validation of its uncertainties is performed on a global and continuous basis. One approach is the direct comparison of this product with ground measurements but that approach presents several issues related to scale, the episodic nature of ground measurements and the global representativeness. An alternative is to compare the surface reflectance product to reference reflectance determined from Top of atmosphere reflectance corrected using accurate radiative transfer code and very detailed measurements of the atmosphere obtained over the AERONET sites (Vermote and al, 2014, RSE) which allows to test for a large range of aerosol characteristics; formers being important inputs for atmospheric corrections. However, the application of this method necessitates the definition of a very detailed protocol for the use of AERONET data especially as far as size distribution and absorption are concerned, so that alternative validation methods or protocols could be compared. This paper describes the protocol we have been working on based on our experience with the AERONET data and its application to the MODIS and VIIRS record.",

            "abstract": "It has been demonstrated through various case studies that multispectral satellite imagery can be utilized in the identification of damage caused by a tornado through the change detection process. This process involves the difference in returned surface reflectance between two images and is often summarized through a variety of ratio-based vegetation indices (VIs). Land cover type plays a large contributing role in the change detection process as the reflectance properties of vegetation can vary based on several factors (e.g. species, greenness, density). Consequently, this provides the possibility for a variable magnitude of loss, making certain land cover regimes less reliable in the damage identification process. Furthermore, the tradeoff between sensor resolution and orbital return period may also play a role in the ability to detect catastrophic loss. Moderate resolution imagery (e.g. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)) provides relatively coarse surface detail with a higher update rate which could hinder the identification of small regions that underwent a dynamic change. Alternatively, imagery with higher spatial resolution (e.g. Landsat) have a longer temporal return period between successive images which could result in natural recovery underestimating the absolute magnitude of damage incurred.\nThis study evaluates the role of land cover type and sensor resolution on four high-end (EF3+) tornado events occurring in four different land cover groups (agriculture, forest, grassland, urban) in the spring season. The closest successive clear images from both Landsat 5 and MODIS are quality controlled for each case. Transacts of surface reflectance across a homogenous land cover type both inside and outside the damage swath are extracted. These metrics are synthesized through the calculation of six different VIs to rank the calculated change metrics by land cover type, sensor resolution and VI.",

NASA’s P‐3B and B200 were deployed to sample vertical profiles over specific focus areas using a spiraling vertical profile flight plan on select days during the 30 day sampling campaign. In this project, we measured organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), inorganic carbon and water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) from filter-based sampling efforts at four ground-based sites across the Houston metropolitan area. Ground-based sites were chosen to represent the downtown area, upwind and downwind as well as the Houston Ship Channel (industrial area). Ratios of EC:OC and WSOC:OC will be used to track contributions of primary and secondary organic carbon (POC and SOC), respectively. Spatial and temporal trends in POC and SOC for the Houston metropolitan area will be discussed.",

This analysis shows that there is a very strong seasonal cycle in the CH4 mole fraction when winds are coming from the southern sector, which peaks in August and September each year with average enhancements of ~80 ppb. Despite many suggestions from other recent studies that CH4 emissions should be significantly enhanced in this region, our analysis indicates that emissions from the North Slope have not increased since the start of the measurement record. However, large enhancements in the CH4 mole fraction originating from the North Slope are correlated with increases in the mean air temperature coming from the same air masses, suggesting that with continued increases in North Slope surface temperatures, CH4 emissions from permafrost will increase in the North Slope as predicted.",

            "abstract": "There has always been a strong perception within the geoscience community that a capstone field course was the pinnacle of an undergraduate geoscience degree. Such a course draws from the student’s accumulated knowledge base, using information from multiple sub-disciplines to solve “real-world” problems. Since 2006, there has been a 92% increase in students attending field camps (Status of the Geoscience Workforce 2014 – AGI). But, the number of field camps has significantly declined. In 1995, 35% of geoscience departments offered a summer field course but by 2006 that number had dropped to 15% (Status Report on Geoscience Summer Field Camps – AGI) and since 2009, the number of field camps listed in the Geology.com directory has dropped from 100 to about 75. This decline is despite the fact that 88% of industry professionals believe fieldwork should “be an integral and required part of undergraduate programs” (Petcovic, et al., 2014).\nIn 2012, in order to meet the growing needs of industry and better prepare our students, Texas A&M University-Kingsville developed an in-house, unique set of field courses that expand the limits of the classroom. We have two required courses. One is similar to a traditional field camp except that it contains a writing intensive component. The six-credit course runs for seven weeks. Prior to camp, students are required to write an introduction (geologic history section) on the study area. We spend two weeks in the field, mapping daily (Big Bend National Park), and then return to Kingsville. Students then have two weeks to finish a fully referenced paper, including their edited introduction, methods, observations, interpretations, discussion and conclusions and once complete, they begin the introduction for the next area. This is another two-week field session, in central Texas. After this, we return the first paper which has been edited for content by geoscience faculty and for grammar by an English instructor. Students spend the next few days correcting edits and turn in a polished, final draft. They use edits and suggestions from this first paper to complete the second paper. Our second field course or “professional development” course occurs between the fall and spring semesters and is two credits, co-taught by industry leaders, and also writing intensive.",

            "abstract": "One of the most widespread habitable environments on Earth lurks just under our feet. Soils, which are created by precipitation-induced chemical weathering of rocks and sediments, provide abundant geochemical sources of energy for microbes, and form even under water-limited or snow-dominated climates. The mineralogy of soils is directly related to climatic and environmental conditions. Typical neutral, well-drained soils are dominated by phyllosilicates produced through hydrolysis by carbonic acid, but the additional presence of sulfates, oxides, reduced iron, and carbonates can indicate other conditions, including variations in water saturation, redox state, and pH. The high clay content of soils enhances preservation, and reducing soils, like those formed in wetlands, can preserve high concentrations of organics in the form of coal precursors.\nOn Mars, deposits with mineralogies consistent with paleosols are observed in several locations, but are best exemplified by clay-bearing deposits on the plateau surrounding Mawrth Vallis. Widespread smectites at Mawrth are consistent with regional paleosols formed under a temperate climate, and detections of leached Al-rich minerals, acid sulfates, and reduced iron-bearing phases are consistent with localized modification of these soils by fluctuating ground water tables. Together, this suggests a wetlands-like surface environment with diverse chemical gradients providing many energy pathways for life and locally high preservation potential.\nWhile sites like Mawrth could be excellent targets for organics and biosignatures on Mars, one limitation of such dispersed sites is that finding high concentrations of organics can be challenging. An alternative would be to utilize deltas and other fluvial deposits as a geological filter. Deltas concentrate the often organic-rich clay size fraction of detrital sediments in well-defined locations. On Earth, the majority of deltaic organics and clays are sourced from soils upstream, and have been shown to host some of the oldest known non-marine organics. Thus, while deltas can be a powerful tool for searching for organics and biosignatures, their utility is greatly enhanced if the sediment source region also exhibits clear evidence for habitability, in the form of soils or other environmental indicators.",

            "abstract": "Urban trees are a component of the urban infrastructure which offers diverse services including environmental, aesthetic and economic. The accumulation of carbon in the atmosphere resulting from the indiscriminate distribution of human populations and urban activities with the unsustainable consumption of natural resources contributes to global environmental change especially in coastal cities like Lagos. Carbon stocks and sequestration by urban trees are increasingly recognized to play significant roles for mitigating climate change. This paper focuses on the estimation of carbon stock and sequestration through biomass estimation and quantification in Ikeja GRA, Lagos. Ikeja possesses a characteristic feature as a microcosm of Lagos due to the wide range of land uses. A canopy assessment of tree population was carried out using itree canopy software. A GPS survey was used to collect an inventory of all trees showing their location, spatial distribution and other attributes. The analysis of the carbon storage and sequestration potential of both actual and potential tree planting sites involved biomass estimations from tree allometry equations. Trees were identified at species level and measurements of their dendrometric values were recorded and integrated into the GIS database to estimate biomass of trees and carbon storage. The trees in the study area were estimated to have a biomass of 441.9 mg and carbon storage of 221.395 kg/tree. By considering the potential tree planting sites the estimated carbon stored increased to 11,352.73 kg. Carbon sequestration value in the study area was found to be 1.6790 tonnes for the existing trees and 40.707 tonnes for the potential tree planting sites (PTPS). The estimation of carbon storage and sequestration values of trees are important incentives for carbon accounting/footprints and monitoring of climate change mitigation which has implications for evaluation and monitoring of urban ecosystem.",

            "abstract": "Over the past sixty years, road deicers (i.e., road salt) have been applied to roadways in high latitudes to improve traffic conditions in winter weather. However, the dissolution of road deicers in highway runoff create waters with high total dissolved solids (TDS), specifically high concentrations of sodium, which can mobilize soil metals via soil cation exchange reactions. While several studies have detailed the interactions of high TDS solutions and surface and ground waters, limited attention is paid to the impacts of high TDS solutions on near-road soils. Between 2013 and 2014, soil water samples were collected from a roadside transect of lysimeter nests in Pittsburgh, PA. Soil water samples were analyzed for metal concentrations and resulting data used to examine cation dynamics. Patterns in soil water calcium and magnesium concentrations follow patterns in soil water sodium concentrations. In our samples, the highest major cation concentrations are found at the deepest lysimeters, suggesting major cations are mobilized to, and potentially accumulate in, deeper soil horizons. Concentration peaks in the downslope soil waters lag concentration peaks at the near-road nest by two months, indicating that road salt plumes persist and migrate following the road salting season. Characterizing the interactions of high TDS solutions and roadside soil cation pools clarifies our understanding of metal dynamics in the roadside environment. A deeper understanding of these processes is necessary to effectively restore and manage watersheds as high TDS solutions (i.e., road deicing, hydraulic fracturing, and marginal irrigation water) increasingly influence ecosystem function.",

There are currently two families of methods used to estimate crustal magnetic thickness. Statistical methods are based on the analysis of the power spectrum of magnetic anomalies and assume a random or fractal model for crustal magnetization. Equivalent dipole methods assume that the crust contains only induced magnetization characterized by a constant magnetic susceptibility and that it can be approximated by a surface distribution of dipoles. Although the first family of methods is most often applied to airborne data and the second family of methods is most often applied to satellite data, they can potentially be applied to both types of data. Because these families of methods rely on very different assumptions, they are not expected to provide the same thickness estimates and depending on the study area one method may be more applicable than the other. In this study, we apply both a statistical method and a dipole equivalent method for estimating the magnetic crustal thickness using aeromagnetic compilations available in the Western US, Greenland, and Australia, and also using synthetic datasets. We compare results from both methods and discuss similarities and differences with respect to the geological context and the data quality.",

            "abstract": "As global climate warms, IPCC predictions suggest dry and seasonally dry regions will become dryer, increasing stress on water resources by growing urban populations (e.g. Southern California; Yucatan, Mexico). This study aims to reconstruct paleohydrologic trends during the late Holocene using foraminifera assemblages in Yucatan, Mexico to determine drought susceptibility in a region affected by migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The ITCZ affects precipitation over the Yucatan Peninsula, potentially decreasing groundwater infiltration and thus reducing discharge in submarine springs at the peninsula margins. The field site Celestun Lagoon near Merida, Yucatan, Mexico, is dominated by spring and groundwater inputs at the northern terminus and opens to the Gulf of Mexico at the southern end resulting in a strong salinity gradient dependent on freshwater influx. We analyzed the foram assemblage in the top 6 cm of a set of 7 cores collected along a lagoonal transect (from the mouth to the head) and plotted the relative abundances of Ammonia beccarii, Elphidium sp., Quinqueloculina sp., and the ostracod Hemicyprideis cf. nichuptensis against site location. A. beccarii abundance increases from 40% near the head to 70% near the middle of the lagoon before dropping to <10% toward the saline lagoon mouth (high abundance in brackish salinity). Quinqueloculina sp. increases from 0% at the upper lagoon to nearly 40% near the mouth showing an opposite trend along the same transect. Elphidium sp. showed no clear trend (abundance range 10-28% throughout), and lowest H. nichuptensis abundance occurred at the middle of the lagoon (10%) increasing to the north and south (up to 60%). The inversely correlated spatial distribution between A. beccarii and Quinqueloculina sp. occurs vertically in an upper lagoon long core from 125-96 cm below sediment-water interface (14C age dates 3968-2820 ka), implying a decreasing salinity over ~1000 yrs and increased precipitation over the peninsula feeding the springs. The relationship between decreasing Elphidium sp. abundance and salinity over the same time interval is unclear; ostracod trends are being measured. This assemblage data corresponds to low δ18O values in Yucatan lakes suggesting low evaporation and increased wet conditions during the same time period.",

It has been largely ignored by some and seen as the cause for the development of whaling and the Thule migration by others. Neither extreme is particularly satisfactory, because of the realities of the climatic constraints operating in the Arctic and given that the populations in question were interacting socially with and affected by members of their own and neighboring groups.\nThis paper looks at the current understanding of climate in North and Northwest Alaska for the last two millennia, a period during which there were some notable climate shifts, including the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the “Little Ice Age.” This time period encompassed some significant cultural alterations including the Birnirk/Thule transition, the Thule migration and the development of the regional variations that are characteristic of Late Western Thule. The timing of the climatic and cultural events has been examined to determine if there were instances when they coincided. Cultural changes which could be correlated to climate change were analyzed, to determine if the nature of the observed cultural changes plausibly can be related to the correlated climate change.",

            "abstract": "Ionization of neutrals by precipitating electrons and ions is the main source of Titan’s nightside ionosphere. Electron densities generated by theoretical modes are much larger than densities measured by instruments onboard the Cassini Orbiter. This model density overabundance must result either from overproduction or from insufficient loss of ions. This presentation has two goals: (1) characterization of the role of electron impact ionization on the nightside ionosphere for different magnetospheric conditions, and (2) presentation of empirical ion production rates determined using densities measured by the Cassini Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) on the nightside. The ionosphere between 1000 and 1400 km is emphasized. We adopt electron fluxes measured by the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer - Electron Spectrometer (CAPS-ELS) and the Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument (MIMI) as classified by Rymer et al. [2009]. The current work demonstrates that modeled and empirical ionization rates on the nightside are in agreement with an electron precipitation source above 1100 km. Ion production rate profiles for each of the cases outlined by Rymer et al. are constructed for various magnetic field topologies. Empirical production rate profiles are generated for deep nightside flybys of Titan. The results also suggest that at lower altitudes (below 1100 km) another source, such as ion precipitation, is probably needed.",

            "abstract": "The salinization of groundwater resources is a widespread problem in arid agricultural environments. In Mewat District (Haryana, India), groundwater salinity has rendered much of the accessible supply unfit for human consumption or agriculture. Historically, this closed basin retained fresh pockets of water at the foothills of the Aravalli Hills, where monsoonal precipitation runoff from the mountains was recharged through infiltration or facilitated by man-made structures. To date, an increasing number of pumps supply the region with fresh water for consumption and agriculture leading to shrinking the freshwater zone at an accelerated pace. The potential for increased human consumption corroborated with the effects of climate change bring uncertainty about the future of water security for the Mewat communities, most of them critically bound to the existence of local water. This study addresses the sustainability of the freshwater supply under a range of land interventions and climate scenarios, using a 2-D groundwater flow and transport model. Our results quantify potential futures for this arid, groundwater-dependent location, using numerical groundwater modeling to quantify interactions between human water use, infrastructure, and climate. Outcomes of this modeling study will inform an NGO active in the area on sustainable management of groundwater resources.",

These whistler \"vortices\" resemble m = 0 helicons in bounded plasmas when n parallel to B0 and m = 1 helicon modes when n is perpendicular to B0. Both dipole orientations produce conical phase fronts that cannot be directly compared to plane wave theories and are inclined at the Gendrin angle. The magnetic field topology exhibits evidence of linkage and helicity, whose sign is defined by propagation direction. The wave fields are force free. Using linear superposition, as demonstrated in Physics of Plasmas 7, 519-526 (2000), the measured fields are added in a variety of configurations to produce, for example, directional radiation patterns, whistler standing waves, and nearly plane whistler waves. The configurations are produced by adding the spatially and temporally shifted observed single-antenna magnetic field topology. The directional antenna configuration is shown to be more efficient than rotating field antennas. Whistler standing waves produce no perfect nodes and have wave polarizations varying spatially between linear and circular. Nearly plane whistler waves are created when the angle θ of wave propagation has been varied by a phase shift along an array of spatially separated antennas. These results are of interest to space and laboratory plasmas. (Work supported by DOE/NSF.)",

            "abstract": "Chronic and widespread coastal erosion along the northern coast of Alaska is threatening traditional lifestyles, sensitive ecosystems, energy and defense related infrastructure, and large tracts of Native Alaskan, State, and Federally managed land. Recent USGS historical shoreline position studies have documented shoreline change rates along most of northern Alaska for the period from 1947 to circa 2000. Rates vary from an erosional high of -18.6 m/yr along vulnerable bluffed coasts, to accretion up to +10.9 m/yr along prograding sand-rich coasts (average rate for entire study area is -1.4 m/yr). The historical analysis gives valuable information regarding long-term rates of change but does not provide details on the timing and processes driving the change.\nOblique and vertical aerial photography contains valuable coastal information on such things as bluff failure mechanisms, presence or absence of shorefast ice, beach characteristics including erosional scarps and ice-push ridges, wrack lines produced during storm surge events, and habitat identification. Recent advances in digital photogrammetry applied to oblique aerial photography can be used to construct high quality DEMs at a relatively low cost. Repeat aerial surveys and resultant DEM construction serve as a potential monitoring tool that can be used to quantify volumetric change, and, if conducted frequently enough, provide insights into the mechanisms responsible for coastal change in the Arctic. We provide examples from a few selected sites in northern Alaska where oblique aerial photography has been used to better understand coastal change in remote and threatened areas.",

            "abstract": "Networks of eddy covariance towers like AmeriFlux provide the infrastructure necessary to study relationships between ecosystem processes and environmental forcing across a range of spatial and temporal scales. Recent syntheses of comparisons between observations from eddy covariance tower sites in North America and output from several Land Surface Models showed that the characterization of phenology was not accurate in most of the models. In order to improve phenological models, a continental-scale phenological observatory, the PhenoCam network, provides high-frequency observations of vegetation phenology, which can be used to derive a greenness index, the green chromatic coordinate (gcc). In this study we run the Community Land Model (CLM4.5) for 10 deciduous forests sites in North America, included in the AmeriFlux and PhenoCam networks, to assimilate multiple data types including one of the key variables in most ecosystem models, fPAR, the radiometric equivalent of Leaf Area Index (LAI). fPAR characterizes vegetation canopy function and energy absorption capacity and therefore it is important for estimating canopy photosynthesis. We use fPAR data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), with a pixel resolution of 1 km x 1 km and a temporal resolution of 8 days. Data is assimilated in CLM with an Ensemble Kalman Filter, a sequential data assimilation technique, within the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). In our study, we also compare observations available for Harvard Forest (LAI, NEE and gcc) with model output. The CLM output for LAI and NEE is sometimes located out of the observation space delimited by LAI and NEE measurements for Harvard Forest. After assimilating data, we compare observations and mean CLM model output from all the sites for a free run, an assimilation run and an assimilation run with inflation. We investigate the impact of assimilating these observations and the resultant model state updates on ecosystem carbon flux predictions.",

In this study, we investigated the relationship between hydraulic conductivity and vegetation type for fens occurring in Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP), Colorado, USA. Vegetation in RMNP fens can be dominated by woody plants and shrubs, such as willows; by mosses; or by herbaceous plants such as sedges. Fens dominated by each vegetation type were selected for study. Six fens were investigated, all of which are in the Colorado River watershed on the west side of RMNP. For each site, soil hydraulic conductivity was measured at multiple locations using a single-ring infiltrometer. As a result of the shallow water table in these fens (the water table was always within 10 cm of the surface), horizontal hydraulic gradients were produced during the field tests. The measured infiltration rates were analyzed using the numerical model HYDRUS. In order to determine the hydraulic conductivity, a parameter estimation problem was solved using HYDRUS as the forward simulator. Horizontal flow was explicitly accounted for in the model. This approach produced more accurate estimates of hydraulic conductivity than would be obtained using an analytical solution that assumes strictly vertical flow. Significant differences in hydraulic properties between fens appear to result at least in part from the effects of different dominant vegetation types on peat soil formation.",

            "abstract": "Most of the oceanic crust is generated at mid oceanic ridges and only a minor portion results from magmatism related to subduction zones (i.e. back-arc basins or in incipient arcs). However it has been observed that several ophiolites preserve an oceanic crust displaying a subduction zone signature. Such a signature is also found in the Khantaishir ophiolite located in western Mongolia. This ~570 m.y. old ophiolite is ~480 km2 in size and displays a complete sequence, tectonically slightly dismembered during the emplacement process. The ophiolite exposes ~130 km2 of highly refractory harzburgitic mantle with local dunite channels and lenses. Towards its top the mantle is replaced by sub-horizontal km-wide discrete zones of pyroxenites situated either in the mantle or forming a crust-mantle transition zone overlain by gabbros. The crust is then composed of various gabbros and minor gabbronorite (both in part replaced by pyroxenites and/or cut by intermediate dykes), by a dyke/sill-complex and by pillow lavas. The entire ophiolite is re-equilibrated at lower greenschist facies conditions. Major and trace elements of the crustal rocks of the Khantaishir ophiolite show trends similar to those observed for the Izu-Bonin-Mariana subduction system. Mafic dykes/sills and pillow lavas of the Khantaishir ophiolite have overall basaltic-andesite compositions, resembling high-Mg andesites with an average SiO2 of 57 wt%. Their low TiO2 (<1.2 wt%) and Ti/V ratios of ~10 contrast with MOR suites, which are basaltic (average SiO2 ~50 wt%) with TiO2 values usually higher than 1.2 wt% and a Ti/V ratio between 20 and 50. This difference is prominent in Th/Yb and Nb/Yb, where the lavas from the Khantaishir ophiolite plot at higher Th/Yb than the typical MORB-OIB array. Moreover, some volcanics with nearly primitive compositions (XMg = 0.69, SiO2 = 56.5 wt%) have trace element patterns comparable with those displayed in high-Mg andesites and boninites from modern island arcs. This evidence suggests that the Kantaishir crust might represent the submarine initial stage of an incipient arc, probably when the preexisting oceanic crust is spread and incipient island arc crust is formed.",

            "abstract": "As gravel-bedded rivers fine downstream, they characteristically exhibit an abrupt transition from gravel- to sand-bed. This is the only abrupt transition in grain-size that occurs in the fluvial system and has attracted considerable attention. A number of competing theories have been proposed to account for the abruptness of the transition, including base-level control, attrition of ~10mm gravel to produce sand, and sediment sorting processes. The prevailing theory for the emergence of abrupt transitions is size selective sorting of bimodal sediment wherein gravel deposits due to downstream declining shear stress, fining the bedload until a sand-bed emerges. We explored this hypothesis by examining grain-size, shear stress, gravel mobility and sand suspension thresholds through the gravel-sand transition (GST) of the Fraser River, British Columbia. The Fraser GST is an arrested gravel wedge with patches of gravel downstream of the wedge forming a diffuse extension. There is an abrupt change in bed slope through the transition that leads to an abrupt change in shear stress. The GST, bed-slope change and backwater caused by the ocean are all coincident spatially, which enhances the sharpness of the GST. Interestingly, the bimodal reach of the river occurs downstream of the GST and exhibits no downstream gradients in shear stress, suspended sediment flux, gravel mobility or sand suspension thresholds. This calls into question the prevailing theory for the emergence of an abrupt GST by size selective sorting. We provide evidence, both empirical and theoretical, that suggests the emergence of an abrupt GST is caused by rapid deposition of sand when fine gravel deposits. We argue that the emergence of gravel-sand transitions is a consequence of gravel-bedded rivers adopting a steeper slope than sand-bedded rivers. The abruptness arises because the bed slope required to convey the gravel load fixes the distal location of a terminal gravel wedge, and once the river has lost the capacity to carry the gravel mixture, the river adopts the lower slope required to pass the sand load. Progressive downstream fining of a gravel-sand mixture is not a necessary condition for the emergence of a gravel-sand transition.",

            "abstract": "Turrialba is an active stratovolcano located 35 km northeast of San Jose, Costa Rica’s capital city and socioeconomic hub. After over 100 years of quiescence Turrialba resumed activity in 1996 progressively increasing its degassing and seismic activity, showing continuous gas emissions since 2007. Intermittent phreatic explosions with ash emissions that have reached the capital have occurred since 2010. This activity has resulted in the temporary evacuation of two villages, closure of the National Park that comprises the summit region of the volcano and devastation of the local ecosystem.\nWe combined a variety of satellite-based time series with ground-based measurements of ambient gas concentrations, element deposition and surveys of species richness to enable a comprehensive assessment of SO2 emissions and changes in vegetation. Satellite-based time-series were obtained from Landsat ETM+, Terra ASTER, Terra/Aqua MODIS and Aura OMI, with some of the data dating back to 2000. From 2007-2010 we observed emissions of SO2 and loss of vegetation healthiness (i.e. decrease of EVI2) downwind of the vents. From 2010 onwards these stabilized, but we observe an apparent decrease in agriculture. Other multi-temporal products, such as the ALOS PALSAR FNF data, confirm our observations. The exposure to the volcanic plume resulted in high soil acidity and significant uptake of certain heavy metals by vegetation; in contrast other elements are leached from the soil as a result of the acid deposition. These factors are likely to be responsible for decreased species richness and physiological damage observed at Turrialba.\nOur study shows ecological impacts, in terms of soil characteristics, vegetation composition and diversity and physiological damage of vegetation, which all correlate to fumigation by Turrialba’s plume. Analyzing and relating the remote observations to conditions and impacts on the ground provides a better understanding of volcanic degassing, its impacts on vegetation and how satellite-based monitoring can be used to inform hazard management strategies related to land use and agricultural productivity in near-real time.",

            "abstract": "Natural variations in the 238U/235U ratio of marine carbonates may provide a useful way of constraining past variations in ocean redox conditions. However, before applying this novel redox proxy, it is essential to explore possible isotopic fractionation during U coprecipitation with aragonite and calcite. We investigated these effects in laboratory experiments.\nAragonite and calcite coprecipitation experiments were conducted at pH 8.5±0.1 using a constant addition method [1]. More than 90% of the U was incorporated into the solid phase at the end of each experiment. Samples were purified using UTEVA chemistry and δ238/235U was measured using 233U-236U double-spike MC-ICP-MS with a precision of ±0.10‰ [2]. The aragonite experiment demonstrated a 238U/235U Rayleigh fractionation factor of α=1.00008±0.00002 with the 238U preferentially incorporated. In contrast, the calcite experiment demonstrated no resolvable U isotope fractionation (α=1.00001±0.00003).\nTo determine if U isotopes are affected during the early diagenetic conversion of aragonite to calcite, natural carbonate samples were collected along an aragonite-calcite transition across a single coral head in the Key Largo limestone, and characterized for U concentration and δ238/235U [3]. We found that the mean δ238/235U in aragonite (-0.33±0.07‰ 2se) was slightly heavier than that in calcite (-0.37±0.02‰ 2se).\nFurther work is needed to address the mechanisms leading to differential isotopic fractionation of U(VI) during incorporation into aragonite and calcite. Possible drivers include differences in coordination in the crystal structure or equilibrium isotopic fractionation between various aqueous U(VI) species prior to incorporation.\n[1] Reeder et al.

            "abstract": "River classifications have been used in river health and ecological assessments as coarse proxies to represent aquatic biodiversity when comprehensive biological and/or species data is unavailable. Currently there are no river classifications or biological data available in a consistent format for the extent of the Greater Mekong Region (GMR; including the Irrawaddy, the Salween, the Chao Praya, the Mekong and the Red River basins). The current project proposes a new river habitat classification for the region, facilitated by the HydroSHEDS (HYDROlogical SHuttle Elevation Derivatives at multiple Scales) database at 500m pixel resolution. The classification project is based on the Global River Classification framework relying on the creation of multiple sub-classifications based on different disciplines. The resulting classes from the sub-classification are later combined into final classes to create a holistic river reach classification. For the GMR, a final habitat classification was created based on three sub-classifications: a hydrological sub-classification based only on discharge indices (river size and flow variability); a physio-climatic sub-classification based on large scale indices of climate and elevation (biomes, ecoregions and elevation); and a geomorphological sub-classification based on local morphology (presence of floodplains, reach gradient and sand transport). Key variables and thresholds were identified in collaboration with local experts to ensure that regional knowledge was included. The final classification is composed 54 unique final classes based on 3 sub-classifications with less than 15 classes each. The resulting classifications are driven by abiotic variables and do not include biological data, but they represent a state-of-the art product based on best available data (mostly global data). The most common river habitat type is the “dry broadleaf, low gradient, very small river”. These classifications could be applied in a wide range of hydro-ecological assessments and useful for a variety of stakeholders such as NGO, governments and researchers.",

            "abstract": "Recent theoretical models of the seismic properties of mantle rocks predict seismic velocity profiles for mature oceanic lithosphere that are fundamentally inconsistent with the best observations of seismic velocities in two ways. Observations of strong positive velocity gradients with depth, and a very sharp and very shallow low-velocity asthenosphere boundary (LAB), both suggest that non-thermal factors such as bulk composition, mineral fabric, grain size, and dehydration play important roles in controlling the formation of the lithosphere, and thus the underlying LAB. There is little consensus on which of these factors are dominant, in part because observations of detailed lithosphere structure are limited. To address this discrepancy, we conducted the NoMelt experiment on ~70 Ma Pacific lithosphere between the Clarion & Clipperton fracture zones. The experiment consists of a 600x400 km array of broad-band ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) and magnetotelluric instruments, and an active-source reflection/refraction experiment. Here we characterize the shear-velocity structure and its seismic anisotropy across the lithosphere-asthenosphere system beneath the array using surface-wave dispersion. Of the 27 deployed instruments, 21 were recovered, all of which produced useful data on the seismometer and the differential pressure gauge in the 20-200 s period band. Energetic, high S/N Rayleigh waves and useful love waves are observed from over 21 and 8 events with Mw > 6.5 respectively. Models of shear velocity as a function of depth derived from intra-array Rayleigh-wave phase velocities are characterized by a relatively constant, high-velocity lithosphere to ~70 km depth, with a rapid drop in velocity below that depth. The combination of a high-velocity lid with an abrupt transition to the low-velocity zone cannot be explained by plate-cooling models. The Rayleigh waves display strong azimuthal anisotropy with a fast direction parallel to fossil spreading at all periods; the anisotropy is strongest at shortest periods, suggesting that the underlying fabric is dominantly in the lithosphere. We are developing a mode-interference analysis to evaluate the Love-wave propagation across the system. These data will provide constraints on the radial anisotropy across the lithosphere-asthenosphere system.",

This allows the researcher to isolate and select the relevant measurements for their topic of study.\nThe Virtual ITM Observatory (VITMO) has many diverse geophysical datasets that cover a large temporal and spatial range that present a unique search problem. VITMO provides many methods by which the user can search for and select data of interest including restricting selections based on geophysical conditions (solar wind speed, Kp, etc) as well as finding those datasets that overlap in time. One of the key challenges in improving discoverability is the ability to identify portions of datasets that overlap in time and in location. The difficulty is that location data is not contained in the metadata for datasets produced by satellites and would be extremely large in volume if it were available, making searching for overlapping data very time consuming.\nTo solve this problem we have developed a series of light-weight web services that can provide a new data search capability for VITMO and others. The services consist of a database of spacecraft ephemerides and instrument fields of view; an overlap calculator to find times when the fields of view of different instruments intersect; and a magnetic field line tracing service that maps in situ and ground based measurements to the equatorial plane in magnetic coordinates for a number of field models and geophysical conditions.\nThese services run in real-time when the user queries for data. They will allow the non-specialist user to select data that they were previously unable to locate, opening up analysis opportunities beyond the instrument teams and specialists, making it easier for future students who come into the field.",

            "abstract": "The loss of sensitivity at higher biomass levels is a common problem in biomass mapping using optical multi-spectral data or radar backscattering data due to the lack of information on canopy vertical structure. Studies have shown that adding implicit information of forest vertical structure improves the performance of forest biomass mapping from optical reflectance and radar backscattering data. LiDAR, InSAR and stereo imager are the data sources for obtaining forest structural information. The potential of providing information on forest vertical structure by stereoscopic imagery data has drawn attention recently due to the availability of high-resolution digital stereo imaging from space and the advances of digital stereo image processing software. The Panchromatic Remote-sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping (PRISM) onboard the Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) has acquired multiple global coverage from June 2006 to April 2011 providing a good data source for regional/global forest studies.\nIn this study, five PRISM triplets acquired on June 14, 2008, August 19 and September 5, 2009; PALSAR dual-pol images acquired on July 12, 2008 and August 30, 2009; and LANDSAT 5 TM images acquired on September 5, 2009 and the field plot data collected in 2009 and 2010 were used to map forest biomass at 50m pixel in an area of about 4000 km2in Maine, USA ( 45.2 deg N 68.6 deg W). PRISM triplets were used to generate point cloud data at 2m pixel first and then the average height of points above NED (National Elevation Dataset) within a 50m by 50m pixel was calculated. Five images were mosaicked and used as canopy height information in the biomass estimation along with the PALSAR HH, HV radar backscattering and optical reflectance vegetation indices from L-5 TM data. A small portion of this region was covered by the Land Vegetation and Ice Sensor (LVIS) in 2009. The biomass maps from the LVIS data was used to evaluate the results from combined use of PRISM, PALSAR and LANDSAT data.\nThe results show that the canopy height index from PRISM stereo images significantly improves the biomass mapping accuracy and extends the saturation level of biomass, and results in a biomass map comparable with those generated from LVIS data.",

Using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 5 (CMIP5) archive, we show that the model simulations also yield similar changes, with anthropogenic aerosols accounting for nearly all of the simulated response and about 1/3 of the observed trends. Consistent with these precipitation changes, both observations and models forced with anthropogenic aerosols yield a reversal in the trend of the leading pattern of sea surface temperature variability in the North Pacific, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Future CMIP5 RCP4.5 ensemble mean also shows a significant negative trend in SW US precipitation. Additionally, NCAR Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) RCP4.5 anthropogenic aerosol forcing (CAM5-AA) experiment shows a significant drying trend throughout 21 century. The CAM5-AA experiment also shows a significant negative PDO trend throughout 21 century. By altering the position of the jet stream, our results suggest that anthropogenic aerosols have perturbed Southwest United States precipitation and have significantly contributed to the recent—and future—drying trend.",

            "abstract": "Carbon injection projects introduce several operational, management and risk-assessment challenges, including leakage of carbon dioxide through fractures or derelict wells, reactivation of dormant faults, topographic subsidence/uplift, and contamination of existing groundwater resources. In this work we evaluate whether geomechanical measurements can be used within a stochastic estimation framework to characterize physical and geometric parameters of a system undergoing injection.\nA numerical forward model built in COMSOL Multiphysics is used to solve the equations governing linear poroelasticity to compute the geomechanical signals (e.g. pressure, strain, tilt and displacement) produced during injection given a set of model parameters (e.g. Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, and permeability). A hybrid Markov Chain Monte Carlo/multiobjective genetic algorithm is then used to iteratively generate a sequence of parameter estimates; distributed high performance computing is used to efficiently evaluate the computationally expensive forward model for each set of parameters. The set of posterior parameter estimates is then used to find the mean and uncertainty of each parameter subject to measurement limitations (noise, model error, spatial/temporal constraints).\nWe find that geomechanical measurements collected within the target formation can be used to accurately and efficiently estimate the physical parameters of the formation. We also observe that measurements taken in an overlying confining unit can be used to estimate the parameters of both the confining unit and target aquifer. This suggests that measurements made in the upper confining unit could mitigate drilling costs as well as reduce the risk of puncturing the confining unit. Using various combinations of synthetic measurements from the confining unit and target aquifer, we have also been able to resolve the geometry and physical parameters of heterogeneities analogous to fluvial gravel lenses and faults. Finally, we have found that when the model used in the inversion is conceptually flawed, systematic data fitting errors occur to alert practitioners to the problem. These numerical experiments demonstrate the potential of geomechanical measurements for characterizing coupled flow and deformation processes in a reservoir.",

            "abstract": "Malaria has afflicted human society for over 2 million years, and remains one of the great killer diseases today. The disease is the fourth leading cause of death for children under five in low income countries (after neonatal disorders, diarrhea, and pneumonia) and is responsible for at least one in every five child deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. It kills up to 3 million people a year, though in recent years scale up of anti-malaria efforts in Africa may have brought deaths to below 1 million. Malaria is highly conditioned by ecology, because of which climate change is likely to change the local dynamics of the disease through changes in ambient temperature and precipitation. To assess the potential implications of climate change for the malaria burden, this paper employs a Malaria Ecology Index from the epidemiology literature, relates it to malaria incidence and mortality using global country-level data , and then draws implications for 2100 by extrapolating the index using several general circulation model (GCM) predictions of temperature and precipitation. The results highlight the climate change driven increase in the basic reproduction number of the disease and the resulting complications for further gains in elimination. For illustrative purposes, I report the change in malaria incidence and mortality if climate change were to happen immediately under current technology and public health efforts.",

            "abstract": "Similarities in trace element geochemistry between ocean-floor sediments and arc lavas suggest the involvement of subducted sediments in the mantle source of arc volcanoes. Siliciclastic sediments produce rhyo-dacitic, hydrous partial melts at sub-arc depths, which must react with wedge peridotite during their ascent. In addition to fluids, these sediment melts can be a major carrier of water to the arc source. Here we investigate the effects of bulk water concentration on the phase equilibria of reaction between sediment partial melt and peridotite.\nPiston-cylinder experiments were performed using Au-Pd capsules, at 2 and 3 GPa, 1050 – 1350 °C with mixtures of 25% rhyolite + 75% lherzolite, bearing bulk water content of 2 (low-water) and 4 wt.% (high-water). Melting degree is higher in high-water experiments at both 2 and 3 GPa with a sharp increase in melt mode from 31 to 53 wt.% at 1250-1300 °C, 2 GPa and 21 to 49 wt.% at 1225-1250 °C, 3 GPa. This sharp increase in melt mode is accompanied by a corresponding abrupt increase in residual olivine to opx ratio at both pressures (0.11 to 0.53 at 1250-1300 °C, 2 GPa and 0 to 0.71 at 1225-1250 °C, 3 GPa). The stability field of phlogopite, clinopyroxene, and garnet are reduced in high-water experiments due to higher degrees of partial melting. Low-water experiments produce basalts with SiO2, on a volatile-free basis, increasing from 49 to 51 wt.% at 2 GPa and 46 to 48 wt.% at 3 GPa. For high-water experiments, melt SiO2 contents at 2 GPa are slightly higher than those in low-water experiments for a given temperature, varying from 51 to 52 wt.%, and, at 3 GPa, the melts trend towards andesitic compositions with SiO2 ~54 wt.%. These compositional characteristics of the melts can be attributed to the effect of increased olivine to opx ratios in the residue as a function of increasing bulk water concentration.\nOur study shows that a spectrum of ultra-potassic, high-Mg arc lavas (MgO varying from 10-16 wt.%) from basaltic to andesitic compositions can be produced by partial melting of sediment melt-fluxed wedge peridotite hybrids with variable water contents.",

            "abstract": "In mountain watersheds of the western US, fire and other disturbances interact with vegetation dynamics and hydrology to affect ecosystem structure and function. It is necessary to couple projections of hydrological processes in a changing climate with projections of fire disturbances, but to our knowledge none of the watershed-scale ecosystem models that have disturbance modules have explicit hydrological routing. This is because it is difficult to find common currency between variables associated with spatially explicit hydrology and those associated with fire spread and fire severity. We have developed WMFire, a stochastic raster-based model of fire spread that integrates fire with the Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System (RHESSys), a spatially distributed model of climate-water-carbon interactions that projects the effects of climatic change on mountain watersheds. We resolve mismatches between the two model systems by aggregating the dynamics of fire spread into probabilities, whereby the probability a fire spreads into a neighboring cell increases with the fuel load and moisture input from the hydrological model, and the probability further increases if the direction of spread is uphill and in line with the prevailing wind direction. In this manner WMFire is expected to replicate patterns of spread and fire regimes, not the propagation of individual fire events. Patterns of fire spread and effects simulated by WMFire are returned to RHESSys, modifying carbon source-sink dynamics and hydrological routing. Model evaluation entails a quantitative procedure to assess the agreement between simulated fire-regime properties and observations. Simulations to date have focused on historical projections to evaluate how well the coupled model replicates fire regimes of the past half-century on two watersheds: one in the HJ Andrews experimental forest in Oregon, USA, and another the watershed supplying water to Santa Fe, NM, USA. In extensive model evaluation we match the level of abstraction of fire spread to that of the hydrological model, thereby identifying and reducing sources of uncertainty both in the fire spread model and in the coupling of the fire spread model with the hydrological model.",

Both simulations show a steady warming trend in the North Sea, especially in the German Bight and central North Sea. A strong freshening of the North Sea is seen in both the projections towards the end of the 21st century, with enhanced fresh water input from the Baltic Sea. This could change the vertical stratification resulting in major changes in the nutrient distribution and ecology. Our results show that winter time SST in the North Sea is positively correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which results in enhanced warming of the North Sea during the positive phase of NAO. The effect of NAO related changes in stratification and temperature is most prominent in the German bight region. A multi-decadal variability is observed in the singular spectrum trend of salinity, therefore an emphasis on disentangling the effect of climate change signal vis-à-vis natural variability on the physical parameters of North Sea is very important. There exist significant differences in simulated parameters between the coupled and uncoupled projections, with coupled model showing comparatively warmer and fresher North Sea in the future. Evaluation of the effect of coupling on simulating physical parameters and climate change will be also focussed in the study.",

            "abstract": "The modern Mississippi deep-sea fan is a large-scale accumulation of Quaternary sediment deposited in the Gulf of Mexico by the modern Mississippi River via the Mississippi delta. The Mississippi River has a well-characterized drainage system extending across North America from the western Rocky Mountains to the Appalachians in the east. Deep-water sand samples of buried channel-fill and lobe deposits of the Mississippi fan from selected Sites of Leg 96 of the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) and were integrated with USGS piston core samples from the most recent lobe for detrital zircon U-Pb isotopic analysis. Since the modern Mississippi River has a well-known catchment, the detrital zircon age ‘signal’ observed in the deep-water sediments can therefore be used as an actualistic study of the detrital zircon provenance signatures resulting from modern drainage patterns. Based on this approach, we compare this dataset with published data and observe minor variability in the detrital zircon signature through time. Populations sourced from the Western North American Cordillera are consistent through time in terms of ages, however Paleocene sediments are slightly enriched in Yavapai-Mazatzal zircons sourced from southwestern continental U.S.. Grenville- and Appalachian-derived zircons reflect minor variation in sediment input from the Appalachian Mountains and related deposits in the eastern Mississippi River catchment. When compared to published Upper Jurassic Norphlet formation detrital zircon data, the Paleocene published dataset and the newly acquired modern sands are partly depleted of Appalachian-derived zircons. This paucity in Appalachian age zircon in Paleocene-to-modern sediments suggests a reconfiguration of the Mississippi River drainage prior to Tertiary time. Since this realignment, the Mississippi River drainage has remained relatively unchanged. Piston core samples from the most recent lobe yielded zircons indicating a recent influx of Appalachian sources. The direct correlation of modern deep-sea fan to the modern Mississippi River suggests that longshore sediment transport along the Gulf of Mexico margin may be minor. These results test and refine existing paleogeographic, sediment dispersal, and source-to-sink models for the Mississippi drainage system through time.",

            "abstract": "The asteroid 4 Vesta, with an average diameter of ~525 km, is the second most massive asteroid in the solar system. Most of our knowledge about this differentiated asteroid comes from the Howardite-Eucrite-Diogenite class of meteorites that originated from Vesta, images provided by Hubble Space Telescope, and data from the Dawn spacecraft that orbited Vesta from July 2011 to September 2012. Notably, these close-range data confirmed what Hubble images suggested: a highly oblate shape in which the equatorial radius is ~60 km greater than the polar radius, a shape consistent with Vesta’s short rotational period of ~5.3 hr. These images also revealed the presence of two large impact craters near the asteroid’s south pole. Rheasilvia, the younger and larger crater at ~500 km in diameter, is superimposed over Veneneia, ~400 km in diameter. The occurrence of two large impacts near a pole, which possesses a relatively small area (less than 30% of the surface), is highly improbable. Thus, we investigate the possibility of True Polar Wander. We hypothesize that the integrated mass deficit of these two basins applied a torque to the lithosphere to reorient the surface relative to the spin axis and thereby placing these basins near the pole. In order for this phenomenon to occur, however, the lithosphere needs to be pliable enough to allow relaxation of the ancient rotational bulge and concurrent development of the current bulge. We have previously explored whether the lithosphere of Vesta could support the large-scale (~20 vertical km) topography of the basins (short answer: it can). Here, we explore whether this lithosphere could also permit True Polar Wander. We use the Finite Element Method and a viscoelastic rheology to simulate the relaxation of an oblate Vesta under a range of plausible thermal scenarios consistent with Vesta’s expected budget of long-lived radiogenic nuclides. Our results indicate that under reasonable thermal conditions, the relaxation of the rotational bulge of Vesta and subsequent True Polar Wander cannot happen. As unlikely as it may be, it seems that both large impacts occurred in the south polar region of Vesta.",

            "abstract": "Understanding water sources, use, and availability in Earth’s arid and semiarid lands is fundamental to understanding and forecasting dryland ecosystem function. While it is accepted that drylands can obtain water from sources other than precipitation (e.g., from dew), little is known about how liquid water supplied to dryland soils via water vapor adsorption (WVA) helps to regulate dryland communities and their activity. WVA – the adsorption of water vapor and subsequent formation of liquid water within soil – occurs at times when the relative humidity in the soil atmosphere is lower than the relative humidity of the overlying air. Surprisingly little research has been focused on WVA, though environmental conditions are such that this phenomenon is likely to occur quite regularly in dryland regions throughout the world. Here we used an observational study in a semiarid grassland and a series of laboratory experiments to explore the role of WVA in providing soil moisture and regulating soil microbial activity (assessed as CO2 efflux rates). Through the introduction of 18O liquid water into the atmosphere of a closed system, we were able to trace the movement of water from the atmosphere to the soil via WVA under a range of temperature conditions. Both in the field setting and in the laboratory, elevated rates of soil respiration were observed with WVA-induced increases in soil moisture. Taken together, these results indicate that vapor adsorption is occurring under a variety of common conditions and provide compelling evidence that this water source may strongly influence the activity of soil microorganisms, including fundamental aspects of the soil carbon cycle.",

            "abstract": "Two Neotethyan Sutures,Izmir-Ankara and Intra-Tauride suture zones meet around Ankara region appx. at right angles.The northerly located Izmir-Ankara Suture zone follows approximately E-W trend and it makes a sharp approximately 90° bend at the east along the western margin of the Çankiri Basin.The Intra-Tauride suture follows approximately the Tuzgölü Fault Zone and trends NW-SE and seems to be overprinted by the structures related to the Izmir-Ankara suture zone. These two sutures meet southeastern corner of the Haymana Basin where the basin makes major eastwards counterclockwise bend.From west to East, the Haymana, Tuzgölü and Çankiri Basins straddle these suture zones and are developed in relation to the subduction and collision processes in the region, making them the perfect sites to unravel deformation history and paleogeography of the Neotethyan suture zones in the region. In order to accomplish this, the tectono-stratigraphic evolution of the basin and its paleogeographical positions, in different time slices, constructed by conducting a very detailed study on the Late Cretaceous to Recent infill of the Haymana, Tuzgölü, and Çankiri Basins. We collected more than 4500 sedimentary paleomagnetic samples for paleomagnetic purposes from 112 different locations within 250 km diameter area.Before the demagnetization process, nearly 3000 core specimens were measured for anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) in order to understand deformation amounts and kinematics.The paleomagnetic results show that the region underwent strong clockwise and counterclockwise rotations more than 90° in places, resulting in the present geometry of the suture zones. The central part of the Haymana basin rotated as high as 90° counterclockwise while its northern part together with the southwestern part of the Çankiri basin and northern part of the Tuzgölü basin rotated approximately 30° clockwise contrary to almost all published paleomagnetic data from the region.The restored orientations based on this new paleomagnetic data indicate that Haymana, Tuzgölü Basin and the SW margin of the Çankiri basins were initially oriented N-S prior to Eocene.These results indicate that the most of the paleogeographical maps and evolutionary scenarios and models of the region requires major re-thinking and serious revisions.",

            "abstract": "Shallow low frequency seismic events are common features associated with restless and erupting volcanoes. The physical mechanisms generating their characteristic low frequency, and often extended duration signals remain poorly understood. Here we present new double-difference relocations and spectral scaling of a group of ~400 shallow low-frequency seismic events occurring within the Mount St. Helens edifice during its 2004-2008 dome-building eruption, as recorded by a temporary seismic array for a month within the crater in 2006. Relocation results suggest that the majority of earthquakes occurred in the center of the crater close to the vent at depths < 500 m, with some events potentially locating under the new dome but ~200-300m southwest of the vent. Low-frequency events exhibit moment-corner frequency scaling roughly consistent with a constant static stress-drop, similar to tectonic earthquakes occurring elsewhere in shallow crustal faults. The scaling suggests that the ~400 events result from stick-slip behavior, and that the low frequency character of the waveforms may result from a combination of path effects and slow rupture speeds.\nFor relocation, we divide the 400 events into eight families based on waveform similarity, and use a subset of nearly 40 earthquakes with clear first arrivals ranging in moment magnitude from 0.4 – 1.8 to calculate hypocenters. We then relocate these events using a double-difference method with a three-dimensional velocity model of the edifice from Waite and Moran (2009). The relocated events are then used to estimate source parameters of the remaining earthquakes via a spectral ratio technique. Spectral corner frequency estimations based on this spectral ratio approach produce stress-drop values of ~1 MPa assuming a shear-wave velocity of 1500 m/s. The estimations also indicate a constant stress-drop scaling for all events, with two event families having lower estimated stress drops of ~0.1 MPa. While localized lithological differences could cause corner frequencies and thus stress drop values to be lower for two of the families, the variations may result from an erroneous assumption of a constant velocity value in the upper 500 m. Overestimations of shear-wave velocity of 30% near the two families with lower stress drops would explain the variation.",

            "abstract": "Upscaling mixing-limited reactive transport of injectates involved in in-situ groundwater treatment schemes remains challenging due to the non-commutation between averaging approaches and nonlinearities in the reaction rate expressions and due to the difficulty in quantifying mixing. The Eulerian effective plume model (macrodispersion model) generally overestimates the reaction rate due to the overestimated mixing of the plume, whereas Lagrangian particle or streamtube approaches do not provide an explicit means for keeping track of mixing extent. The lamella approach is a new modeling tool that overcomes the abovementioned shortcomings by combining mixing measures such as the scalar dissipation rate with a Lagrangian modeling focus on front-tracking. This approach involves dividing the moving interface between the displacing-displaced solutions into approximately linear segments (set of lamellae) on which the mixing-limited reactions take place and studying the transport mechanisms and the chemical reactions on them. This approach is summarized in application to idealized radial injection, where mixing between the injected and displaced solutions leads to calcite precipitation..The theoretical reaction rate found via the simplified lamella approach is compared with explicit simulation using a finite elements (COMSOL) framework fitted with the representative multicomponent equilibrium reaction network.",

            "abstract": "The western region of the Greenland Ice Sheet around and above the equilibrium line is characterized by relatively high accumulation rates with short-lasting melt events of variable intensity during the summer months. During melt season, supra-glacial lakes are formed at least temporarily in depressions found in the topography of the ice. These ponds can form and drain rapidly, affecting the dynamics of the ice below. Recent warming trends have gradually increased the amount of meltwater found every summer over the ice sheet, with melt regimes migrating to higher altitudes. Consequentially, supra-glacial lakes are being found at higher elevations, yet it is unclear what mechanisms control their formation over firn. We used data from different radar systems acquired by Operation Icebridge around and over lakes formed above the equilibrium line of the Greenland Ice Sheet to study internal features of identified frozen/drained supra-glacial lakes, and to investigate near-surface snow and firn conditions in the vicinity of the ponds by radar-mapping internal snowpack structure. Airborne radar and additional field observations revealed extensive and impermeable ice layers 20-70 cm thick formed at elevations between 1500 m and 2200 m. Buried by winter accumulation, these ice layers prevent further meltwater to percolate deeper during melt season, limiting firn capacity to absorb meltwater and causing near-surface snowpack saturation, thus facilitating the transport of meltwater to newly-formed basins above the equilibrium line. Ice penetrating capabilities from the different radar systems allow the survey of different firn layers and internal features created by refrozen meltwater. IceBridge data is acquired in early spring, when no liquid water content is found over this region ensuring adequate radar response.",

            "abstract": "Predicting the temporal response of stream water quality to a proposed reduction in contaminant loading is a major watershed management problem due to temporary storage of contaminants in groundwater, vegetation, snowpack, etc. We describe the response of dynamically calibrated SPARROW models of total nitrogen (TN) flux to hypothetical reductions in reactive nitrogen inputs in three sub-regional watersheds: Potomac River Basin (Chesapeake Bay drainage), Long Island Sound drainage, and South Carolina coastal drainage. The models are based on seasonal water quality and watershed input data from 170 monitoring stations for the period 2002 to 2008.\nThe spatial reference frames of the three models are stream networks containing an average 38,000 catchments and the time step is seasonal. We use MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and snow/ice cover data to parameterize seasonal uptake and release of nitrogen from vegetation and snowpack. The model accounts for storage of total nitrogen inputs from fertilized cropland, pasture, urban land, and atmospheric deposition. Model calibration is by non-linear regression. Model source terms based on previous season export allow for recursive simulation of stream flux and can be used to estimate the approximate residence times of TN in the watersheds.\nCatchment residence times in the Long Island Sound Basin are shorter (typically < 1 year) than in the Potomac or South Carolina Basins (typically > 1 year), in part, because a significant fraction of nitrogen flux derives from snowmelt and occurs within one season of snowfall. We use the calibrated models to examine the response of TN flux to hypothetical step reductions in source inputs at the beginning of the 2002-2008 period and the influence of observed fluctuations in precipitation, temperature, vegetation growth and snow melt over the period. Following non-point source reductions of up to 100%, stream flux was found to continue to vary greatly for several years as a function of seasonal conditions, with high values in both winter (January, February, March) and spring due to high precipitation and snow melt, but much lower summer yields due to low precipitation and nitrogen retention in growing vegetation (EVI). Temporal variations in stream flux are large enough to potentially mask water quality improvements for several years.",

Current wind power estimates rely on the use of mean climatological wind speeds. This approach to estimating wind power neglects the influence of momentum extraction by the turbines (i.e. turbine-turbine interactions) and interannual variability in windspeed. The present study will use a wind turbine parameterization within the Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF) model to assess the role of interannual and climatic variability on power extraction. The WRF model will be forced by NARR, and run from 1980-2010 to incorporate different climatic conditions over the central United States. Analysis focusses on the role of climate variability on wind power extraction; specifically on the role of drought and wet periods, as well as variability in the Great Plains Low Level Jet. In addition, WRF will be used to assess the impact of wind turbines on each term of the momentum budget. Understanding the impact of interannual variability will improve our understanding of the role that wind power can play in meeting future energy demands.",

Because this stock extends to several meters below the surface for many coastal wetlands, it becomes paramount to understand the fate of C under ecosystem shifts, varying natural environmental constraints, and changing land use. In this project we analyze total hydrolysable carbohydrates, amino acids, phenols and stable isotopic data (δ13C) at two study sites located on the Texas coastline to investigate chemical compositions and the stage of decomposition in mangrove and marsh grass dominated wetlands. Carbohydrates are used as specific decomposition indicators of the polysaccharide component of wetland plants, whereas amino acids are used to identify the contribution of microbial biomass, and acid/aldehyde ratios of syringyl (S) and vanillyl (V) phenols (Ac/AlS,V) follow the decomposition of lignin. Preliminary results show carbohydrates account for 30-50 % of organic carbon in plant litter and surface sediments at both sites. Sharp declines of carbohydrate yields with depth occur parallel to increasing Ac/AlS,V ratios indicating substantial decomposition of both the polysaccharide and lignin components of litter detritus. Ecological differences (between marsh grass and mangrove dominated wetlands) are discussed to better constrain the role of litter biochemistry and ecological shifts on C preservation in these anoxic environments.",

Daily simulations of natural Delta flows for the period 1922-2009 were obtained using precipitation-snowmelt-runoff models for the upper watersheds that are tributaries to the California’s Central Valley, and then routing the water through the Central Valley floor area using a modified version of the California Central Valley Groundwater-Surface Water Simulation Model (C2VSIM) for water years 1922 through 2009. Daily stream inflows from all major upper watersheds were simulated using 23 Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) models. Historical precipitation and reference evapotranspiration data were extracted from the SIMETAW2 with the 4km gridded meteorological data. The Historical natural and riparian vegetation distributions were compiled from several pre-1900 historical vegetation maps of the Central Valley. Wetlands were dynamically simulated using interconnected lakes. Flows overtopping natural levees were simulated using flow rating curves. New estimates of potential evapotranspiration from different vegetative classes under natural conditions were also used. Sensitivity simulations demonstrate that evapotranspiration estimates, native vegetation distribution, surface-groundwater interaction parameters, extinction depth for groundwater uptake, and other physical processes play a key role in the magnitude and timing of upstream flows arriving at the Delta. Findings contradict a common misconception that the magnitude of inflows to the Delta under natural vegetative conditions is greater than those under the historical agricultural and urban land use development. The developed models also enable to study the impacts of global warming by modifying meteorological and climatic conditions that comport with the various projections. The developed set of tools also provides a more systematic, reliable and scientific means for setting the Bay-Delta flow and quality standards and examining ways to improve the health and sustainability of the ecosystem.",

            "abstract": "Sandbars in sand-bedded rivers of the Central U.S. are highly dynamic, with substantive changes occurring across a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. River hydrology is the primary driver of channel patterns and morphodynamics in these systems, and characterization of sandbar responses to varying flow regime allows for a better understanding of landscape-scale ecology for sandbar-dependent species. We are developing models of sandbar response to river hydrology to be used initially in a metapopulation ecological model of the endangered Interior Least Tern (Sterna antillarum) for 11 different predominantly regulated rivers of the Central U.S. plains. The model is being developed to simulate long term (>30 years) species population dynamics. Because of the large temporal and spatial scope of this effort, we are using an empirical approach to characterize dynamics of sandbar location and extent within the modeling domain in place of more intensive physical models. We developed a dataset of in-channel land cover classifications spanning from 1982 to 2011 for the modeling domain using surface reflectance data from select images of the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) Climate Data Record (CDR). Additionally, we segmented all rivers into lengths with approximately uniform discharge and compiled historic discharge data for each segment. We integrated these data to develop a long-term dataset of sandbar area, cover type, and prevailing discharge. We used residuals of regressions between sandbar area and discharge to normalize sandbar area to varying discharge. By comparing our sandbar area and vegetation cover dataset to historic discharge records, we characterize the types of hydrographs that form, erode, and recruit vegetation on sandbars in different river systems, and the rates at which these processes occur. Additionally, we use geomorphic covariates calculated from remote sensing data to begin to explore controls on spatial variation in sandbar morphodynamics.",

            "abstract": "The Lusi mud eruption, near Sidoarjo, East Java, Indonesia, began erupting in May 2006 and continues to erupt today. Previous analyses of surface deformation data suggested an exponential decay of the pressure in the mud source, but did not constrain the geometry and evolution of the source(s) from which the erupting mud and fluids ascend. To understand the spatiotemporal evolution of the mud and fluid sources, we apply a time-dependent inversion scheme to a densely populated InSAR time series of the surface deformation at Lusi. The SAR data set includes 50 images acquired on 3 overlapping tracks of the ALOS L-band satellite between May 2006 and April 2011. Following multitemporal analysis of this data set, the obtained surface deformation time series is inverted in a time-dependent framework to solve for the volume changes of distributed point sources in the subsurface. The volume change distribution resulting from this modeling scheme shows two zones of high volume change underneath Lusi at 0.5-1.5 km and 4-5.5km depth as well as another shallow zone, 7 km to the west of Lusi and underneath the Wunut gas field. The cumulative volume change within the shallow source beneath Lusi is ~2-4 times larger than that of the deep source, whilst the ratio of the Lusi shallow source volume change to that of Wunut gas field is ~1. This observation and model suggest that the Lusi shallow source played a key role in eruption process and mud supply, but that additional fluids do ascend from depths >4 km on eruptive timescales.",

            "abstract": "Emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2) from vehicles are important precursors to ozone (O3) formation, and thus contribute to environmental and health issues. Both carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) are large emissions from combustion, with the former a marker for total fuel consumption and the latter a commonly used combustion tracer. Thus, measurements of NOx to CO and CO2 emission ratios form an important part of characterizing total vehicle NOx emissions. Vehicle NOx emissions are primarily in the form of NO, although the NO2 content of these emissions may be changing as a result of control technology implementation, particularly for Diesel engines. Characterization of direct NO2 emission factors (i.e., NO2 to NOx ratio) is important because NO2 produces ozone upon its photolysis, while NO emission titrates ozone near sources.\nNO + O3 → NO2 + O2\nNO2 + hν (+ O2) → NO + O3\nHigher NO2 to NO emission ratios will likely result in higher ozone levels per unit NOx emitted. Higher NO2 emission ratios also lead to ozone production in closer proximity to the emission sources. There is a substantial lack of top-down measurements to assess emission inventories. Here we present an analysis of on-road measurements of vehicular emissions. We simultaneously measured NO, NO2 and O3 with a shared inlet at 20 pptv/s precision using a custom-built cavity ring-down measurement system in an instrumented van, together with high time resolution measurements of CO and CO2. Measurements were performed while driving throughout the Colorado Front Range urban area. We present a statistical analysis of vehicle plumes and their corresponding emissions ratios that can be used to constrain the direct emission ratio of NO2 in NOx, and NOx emission factors relative to CO and CO2.",

            "abstract": "A major need stated by the NASA Earth science research strategy is to develop long-term, consistent, and calibrated data and products that are valid across multiple missions and satellite sensors. NASA has invested in the creation of consistent time series satellite data sets over decades, through both mission science team-based and measurement-based data product reprocessing and through solicitations for merged data products. The NOAA/NASA Pathfinder Program, carried out in the mid-1990’s, resulted in the reprocessing of four long time-series datasets from existing archives. The Research, Education and Applications Solutions Network (REASoN) Program, initiated in 2002, consisted of several projects that provided data products, information systems and services capabilities, and/or advanced data systems technologies, to address strategic needs in Earth science research, applications, and education. The Program named Making Earth System data records for Use in Research for Earth Science, or MEaSUREs has had two requests for proposals, the first in 2006 and the second in 2012. With this Program, the Earth Science Division has focused on generating datasets for particular Earth science research measurement needs, and refers to such datasets as Earth System Data Records (ESDRs). Climate Data Records (CDRs) are a particular case of ESDRs. An ESDR is defined as a unified and coherent set of observations of a given parameter of the Earth system, which is optimized to meet specific requirements in addressing science questions.\nMost of the MEaSUREs projects are five years long. They produce ESDRs using mature, peer-reviewed algorithms. The products are vetted by the user community in the respective scientific disciplines. They are made available publicly by the projects during their execution period. Before the projects end, the ESDRs are transferred to one of the NASA-assigned Distributed Active Archive Centers for longer-term archiving and distribution. Tens of millions of ESDR files have been distributed to tens of thousands of users over the last five years, and the activity is on-going. The scientific impact of the Program can be seen in the number of citations (e.g., 960 in Fiscal Year 2013) in peer-reviewed scientific literature referencing the MEaSUREs products or algorithm-related publications.",

            "abstract": "During the last two decades, the Greenland ice sheet has been losing mass, significantly contributing to sea level rise (0.33±0.08 mm yr-1). In the meantime, summer surface melt has been increasing in both duration and extent, and subsequent runoff represents about half of the total mass lost. However, small-scale heterogeneous physical processes and residence times associated with meltwater formation, infiltration in the firn, refreezing and/or runoff remain unconstrained in coarser resolution numerical models, leading to significant error bars while estimating total runoff. In Southeast and South Greenland, widespread aquifers have been observed in relative high accumulation and melt regions, persisting throughout the year, storing a significant mass of water within the firn. The presence of a persistent water table within the firn aquifer is observed using a 400 MHz ground-penetrating radar and the 750 MHz airborne Accumulation Radar over the same location. In both radar echograms, a strong reflection is present, illustrating the important dielectric contrast between dry firn and water-saturated firn. Since 2011, NASA’s Operation IceBridge mission allows us to produce an ice-sheet-wide map of the location and depth of the firn aquifer using the Accumulation Radar echograms. Over the last four years, from one spring to the next, repeated flight lines demonstrate a relatively steady short-term behavior of water in the aquifer with constant lateral boundaries (with a few exceptions) and water table surface. An earlier radar survey (1993) implies the aquifer presence by lack of bed return, but the study area was limited to the Helheim Glacier region. Within the aquifer, a relatively slow flow of water is inferred from 2-D hydrological flow modeling, while assuming a constant hydraulic conductivity in the aquifer. On the aquifer low-elevation lateral boundary, connection with crevasses are observed in the airborne radar echograms and documented in this study. More work is required to quantify the water volume potentially draining from the aquifer into the crevasse system. The aquifer presence will need to be taken into consideration during mass balance estimations as it could impact the elevation change to mass change conversion for certain regions of the Greenland ice sheet.",

The high sensitivity of mountain glaciers to even small\nperturbations in the climate has the potential to provide very detailed records of regional\nglacier and climate histories. Recent progress in age determination techniques such as\nsurface exposure dating has greatly improved the temporal precision of glacial records.\nThe conversion of changes in glacier geometries to a climate signal, however, remains a\nsignificant challenge. A particular need exists for a versatile method easily applicable to\ndiverse regions and conditions around the globe. Because the equilibrium line altitude\n(ELA) provides a more explicit comparison of climate than properties such as glacier length\nor area, ELA methods lend themselves well to such a need, and allow for a more direct\ninvestigation of the primary drivers of mountain glaciations during specific events. Here we\npresent a new, robust ELA model for quantifying changes in climate directly from glacier\ngeometry. The model derives from a linear flow model based on Glen’s Flow law while fully\naccounting for glacier hypsometry. As a preliminary application, we combined our modeled\nELA reconstructions with a new 10Be chronology of late glacial culminations in Graubünden\nin the Swiss Alps. These glacier culminations occurred during the Egesen Stadial, which has\nbeen correlated to the Younger Dryas (YD) interval. Results for two related glacier systems\nin Graubünden reveal an ELA depression of 365-401 m (depending on the moraines\nchosen) during the Egesen stage/YD compared to the modern ELA. This agrees well both\nwith established estimates for ELA depressions in the region and an additional application\nperformed using our model and previously determined ages on the nearby Lagrev Glacier\n(a 370 m ELA depression). We then reconstruct the temperature and precipitation changes\nrequired to explain the ELA changes for these Swiss glacier systems. We will apply the\nmodel to other regions in order to further elucidate the variability and sensitivity in the\nclimate system during the YD, and provide insight into the primary drivers of those changes.",

Trees are an important component of the critical zone due to their significant effects on carbon, water, and oxygen cycles. They also constitute a significant portion of the biomass that relies on water and minerals from the soils. However it is a challenging task to monitor their interaction with the critical zone without damaging the trees. Geophysical methods are highly effective tools to monitor near surface processes that have the potential to provide in-situ images of the root structure. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is an efficient method to map the root structure, monitor the soil moisture distributions around root systems as they respond to the temporal drivers. This study introduces a novel and fast measurement technique to collect and process GPR data. Images of three-dimensional root structure and the soil moisture distribution in the surrounding volume provide insights into the fundamentals of plant-soil-water interactions.",

            "abstract": "Icebergs calved from tidewater glaciers act as distributed freshwater sources as they transit through fjords to the surrounding ocean basins. Glacier discharge estimates provide a crude approximation of the total iceberg discharge on inter-annual timescales, but the liquid freshwater flux from icebergs in glacial fjords is largely unknown. Here we use repeat high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) to derive meltwater fluxes for 18 icebergs in Sermilik Fjord, East Greenland, during the 2011-2013 boreal summers, and for 33 comparably-sized icebergs in Ilulissat Fjord, West Greenland, during March-April 2011 and July 2012. We find that iceberg melt rates for Sermilik Fjord are in good agreement with simulated melt rates along the vertical terminus of Helheim Glacier in winter, i.e. when melting at the glacier front is not enhanced by subglacial discharge, providing an independent validation of our technique. Variations in meltwater fluxes from icebergs are primarily related to differences in the submerged area of individual icebergs, which is consistent with theory. The stratification of water masses in fjords has a noticeable effect on summertime-derived melt estimates, with lower melt rates (and meltwater fluxes) observed in the relatively cold and fresh Polar Water layer and higher melt rates in the underlying warmer and more saline Atlantic Water layer. The meltwater flux dependence on submerged area, particularly within the deeper Atlantic Water layer, suggests that changes in the characteristics of icebergs (size/shape/keel-depth) calved from a tidewater glacier will alter the magnitude and distribution of meltwater fluxes within the fjord, which may in turn influence fjord circulation and the heat content delivered to the glacier terminus.",

            "abstract": "Rising atmospheric CO2 levels are predicted to alter C cycling and terrestrial ecosystem functions through effects on plant-microbial interactions. Under elevated CO2, plants transfer more C belowground. However, the fate, transformation and consequence of this extra C in soil are not well understood. We examined the influence of eCO2 on the belowground C cycling using Avena fatua, a common Mediterranean annual grass, with its root associated microbial community across multiple plant growth stages over one-growing season. Avena grown under eCO2 (700 ppm) 13CO2 increased both total C allocated belowground and the amount of root-derived 13C in the mineral-associated fraction. Although eCO2 did not show any significant impact on the abundance (quantified by qPCR) and composition (assessed by MiSeq 16S and ITS sequencing) of rhizosphere microbial community at any sampling time point, small but significant shifts on rhizosphere microbial functional potential were detected using GeoChip 5.0. In addition, the rhizosphere effect (i.e., impact of roots on rhizosphere community versus bulk soil) was much stronger in plants grown under eCO2 than these under ambient CO2 (aCO2). The rhizosphere enriched genes included key functional genes involved in C, N, P and S cycling as well as stress response. The signal intensities of a number of C cycling genes shifted significantly in rhizosphere communities associated with plants grown under eCO2, and many of these genes are involved in the decomposition of low molecular weight C compounds. When plants became senescent, the abundance of some genes encoding enzymes capable of decomposing macromolecular C compounds (e.g., xylanase, endopolygalacturonase) were significant higher in the rhizosphere of Avena grown in eCO2 than aCO2 condition, which may be due to the higher amount of Avena root debris detected at the end of season. Understanding modulations of plant-microbial interactions due to changing climate may allow improved prediction and model parameterization.",

            "abstract": "NASA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Mission, due to launch January 2015, will provide global observations of the Earth’s surface soil moisture, providing high accuracy, resolution and continuous global coverage. This paper seeks to show how SMAP data can be used in flood applications to improve flood warning/planning operations for the Upper Mississippi River basin. The Mississippi River ranks as the fourth longest and tenth largest river in the world and is noted as one of the most altered rivers in the United States. The Mississippi River has a very long track record of flood events, with the 2011 event being a unique event due to large volumes of snow melt and heavy spring rain in the Upper Mississippi basin. Understanding and modeling these processes and combining them with relevant satellite observations such as soil moisture conditions could help alleviate some of the risk to flooding by identifying when infiltration to soils is cut off causing excessive runoff.\nThe objective of the analysis is to improve our understanding of how satellite-derived soil moisture will impact basin scaled/multi state decision processes linked to emergency planning and preparedness, such as FEMA FloodSMART. Using the snow hydrology model SNOW-17 (NWS) coupled to a large-scale two-dimensional floodplain inundation model LISFLOOD-FP, the study evaluates how different soil moisture states can be captured by satellites to enable a multi-state decision process focused on flood risk and planning. The study develops a scenario that applies historical soil moisture data from past events to monitor basin soil moisture conditions and yields a percent value of the saturation status. Scenario analysis is particularly important for decision makers such as emergency responders and insurers as their operations depend on their ability to gauge and appropriately assess risk. This analysis will enables insurers to develop mitigation strategies and contingency plans for such events.",

            "abstract": "One of the largest uncertainties in the Holocene ocean-atmosphere carbon cycle is the role of the Southern Ocean (SO) and subpolar seas in controlling atmospheric CO2 levels. The strength and position of the westerly winds is thought to control rates of CO2 exchange as well as depth of ventilation. Secondarily, through their control on the large scale geostrophic circulation, the westerlies influence the position of major ocean frontal boundaries as well as stratification in the Southern Ocean – additional controls on SO carbon uptake. However, little is known about westerly wind variability over the Holocene. Southern Patagonia is an ideal locality for addressing this uncertainty, as it is the only major landmass that extends into the southern westerly wind field. In particular, lake and fjord environments hold potential for reconstructing precipitation, which is closely correlated with westerly wind strength in this region. Here we present a multi-proxy lacustrine sediment core record from Lago Sarmiento (51.06˚S, 72.91˚W), a large, closed-basin lake in southwest Chilean Patagonia. We observe highly variable C:N ratios between ~12,500 and ~6,000 14C yr BP, indicating recurrent transitions from grassland to forest. We measured a steady increase in the C:N ratio from ~6,000 14C yr BP to present, indicating a sustained shift from grassland to the modern Nothofagus forest and more humid conditions. We observe a general decreasing trend in bulk carbonate δ18O since ~4,000 14C yr BP, which we interpret as a progressive increase in westerly wind intensity and associated tendency towards positive water balance. Weight percent bulk carbonate varies greatly, with a strong decreasing trend in the early Holocene, followed by an increasing trend during the mid-Holocene, and a dip followed by a short rise in the late Holocene. Comparison with other records from southern Patagonia and Antarctica is improving our understanding of the forcing mechanisms driving changes in the southern hemisphere westerlies.",

            "abstract": "Oil and gas generation is a set of processes which taking place in the interior, the processes can’t be observable in nature. In the process of dumping the source rock, organic matter is transformed into a complex of high-molecular compounds - precursors of oil and gas (kerogen). Entering of a source column for specific thermobaric conditions, triggers the formation of low molecular weight hydrocarbon compounds. Generation of sufficient quantities of hydrocarbons leads to the primary fluid migration within the source rock.\nFor the experiment were selected mainly siliceous-carbonate composition rocks from Domanic horizon South-Tatar arch. The main aim of experiment was heating the rocks in the pyrolyzer to temperatures which correspond katagenes stages. For monitoring changes in the morphology of the pore space X-ray microtomography method was used.\nAs a result, when was made a study of the composition of mineral and organic content of the rocks, as well as textural and structural features, have been identified that the majority of the rock samples within the selected collection are identical. However, characteristics such as organic content and texture of rocks are different. Thus, the experiment was divided into two parts: 1) the study of the influence of organic matter content on the morphology of the rock in the process of thermal effects; 2) study the effect of texture on the primary migration processes for the same values of organic matter. Also, an additional experiment was conducted to study the dynamics of changes in the structure of the pore space.\nAt each stage of the experiment morphology of altered rocks characterized by the formation of new pores and channels connecting the primary voids. However, it was noted that the samples with a relatively low content of the organic matter had less changes in pore space morphology, in contrast to rocks with a high organic content. At the second stage of the research also revealed that the conversion of the pore space at the expense of primary migration processes in rocks with different textures can be held in different ways.\nDuring the sequential heating significant changes in the structure of the pore space have occurred in the step from 260 ° C to 430 º C. This temperature range corresponds to the most intense stage of the formation of hydrocarbons.",

            "abstract": "Methane emitted from wetlands represents the end product of various microbial processes operating within anaerobic wetland soils. Determining the rate at which these microbial reactions occur is challenging, making it difficult to gain a mechanistic understanding of the factors and conditions that influence microbial rates and ultimately methane emissions. One approach for estimating in-situ reaction rates involves tracking the time evolution of porewater concentrations and stable carbon isotopes of CH4 and CO2. Microbes preferentially use isotopically light carbon substrates, which causes the carbon product pool to become isotopically lighter and the carbon substrate pool become isotopically heavier. Different microbial biochemical pathways fractionate carbon to different extents, allowing for differentiation between microbial reactions. This is a powerful approach to estimate in-situ rates, but, as we show in our presentation, it is possible for different combinations of reaction rates to provide equally good fits to the evolution of these data. The solution is non-unique and depends on the set of considered reactions. We used two different reaction network models on a set of porewater data collected from a thermokarst bog at the Alaska Peatland Experiment (APEX) outside of Fairbanks, AK to estimate in-situ microbial reaction rates during the summer season. Both models included methane production, methane oxidation and fermentation/respiration, but only one model included homoacetogenesis. We found that both reaction networks explained the evolution of dissolved gas concentrations and stable carbon isotope data, but predicted rates that differed from each other by up to a factor of six. The methane production rates estimated by the model that included homoacetogenesis aligned better with measured rates of methane emission. Despite differences in the magnitude of modeled rates, results from the two models told a similar story about the spatial and temporal patterns of microbial rates at the site. Modeled rates were higher at the edge of the bog than in the center of the bog, and rates at the edge increased during the summer while those in the center did not change with time. In both the center and at the edge of the bog, modeled rates increased with depth. We present hypotheses for these patterns.",

Most of the existing oil plume models use a Lagrangian based approach, which computes integral measures such as plume centerline trajectory and plume radius. However, this approach doesn’t account for feedbacks of the buoyant plume on the ambient environment. Instead, we employ an Eulerian based approach to acquire a better understanding of the dynamics of buoyant plumes. We have performed a series of hydrostatic modeling simulations using the MITgcm. Our results show that there is a dynamical response caused by the presence of the buoyant plume, in that there is a modification of the background flow. We find that the buoyant plume becomes baroclinically unstable and sheds eddies at the neutral buoyancy layer. We also explore different scenarios to determine the effect of the buoyancy source and the temperature stratification on the evolution of buoyant plumes.",

Presently, very little is known about how climate change will impact these events. Since these phenomenon are not resolved by climate models, proxies are required to understand how these events may change in the future.\nPrior to investigating how convective environments change in the future, a reference must be obtained to understand the current climatology of convective environments. Studies such as Kennedy et al. (2011) have shown there are significant differences in reanalyses for regions prone to severe weather.\nSevere weather parameters such as Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE), Lifted Index, K Index, Total Totals, 0-1 km shear, 0-3 km shear and 0-6 km shear are calculated using soundings from reanalyses for known severe convective environments. Reanalyses included in this study are the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA), 20th Century Reanalysis (20CR), Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), Japanese 25-year Reanalysis (JRA25), and Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA55).

            "abstract": "Despite its very low mixing ratios relative to the troposphere, water vapor in the lower stratosphere (LS) plays a significant role in Earth’s radiative balance and climate system and is an important constituent in stratospheric chemistry. The low H2O content of air entering the LS is established to first order by dehydration processes controlled by the cold temperatures of the tropical tropopause layer (TTL). Cirrus clouds occur with high frequency and large spatial extent in the TTL, and those occurring near the thermal tropopause facilitate the final dehydration of stratosphere-bound air parcels. Uncertainties in aspects of the nucleation and growth of cirrus cloud particles and the sparseness of in situ water vapor and cirrus cloud observations with sufficient spatial resolution limit our ability to fully describe the final stages of the dehydration process before air enters the LS in the tropics.\nThe NASA Airborne Tropical Tropopause Experiment (ATTREX) measurement campaign has yielded more than 140 hours of sampling from the Global Hawk UAS in the Pacific TTL during deployments in 2013 and 2014, including more than 30 hours sampling TTL cirrus. The high spatial and temporal resolution in situ measurements of water vapor and cirrus cloud properties made during ATTREX provide an outstanding dataset by which to characterize the Pacific TTL environment and evaluate our current understanding of the dynamical and microphysical processes that result in the dehydration of stratosphere-bound air in this region. Here we present a statistical analysis of the ATTREX water vapor, relative humidity and cirrus cloud crystal number and ice water content (IWC) data in order to investigate cirrus cloud formation and resulting potential for dehydration.",

            "abstract": "Short-period (~5-15 minute), small-scale (10s of km) gravity waves propagating through the middle atmosphere will encounter and interact with other atmospheric waves and flows, which can vary horizontally, vertically, and temporally across a wide range of scales. Simulations of gravity wave impacts over global scales generally consider vertical propagation and atmospheric variations, and neglect small scale wave reflection and interactions between waves of different scales and the time dependent background atmosphere [e.g., Fritts and Alexander, Rev. Geo., 41, 1, 2003, and references cited therein]. Short period gravity waves , which are often subject to reflection, nevertheless carry significant momentum through the atmosphere [Hines, 1997, J. Atmos. Sol. Terr. Phys., 59]. Prior studies have investigated gravity wave propagation through horizontally sheared winds [e.g., Basovich and Tsimring, J. Fluid. Mech., 142, 1984], or in altitude and time varying backgrounds [e.g., Broutman and Young, J. Fluid. Mech., 166, 1986]. Senf and Achatz [JGR, 116, D24, 2011, and references cited therein] have also considered propagation through vertically, horizontally, and temporally varying background winds, finding significant reduction of dissipation by critical levels. We here use a combination of 2D numerical simulations and ray-tracing to study the effects of medium scale background wave wind fields on the upward propagation of small-scale, short-period waves. In particular, we consider cases where the short-period waves would be classically reflected or ducted in static realistic background temperature and wind structures. Results suggest an important role for medium-scale temporal and spatial atmospheric variability in reducing the strength of reflections and facilitating the upward propagation of small-scale waves.",

Comparison of ozone records from the NCFR clearly show that ozone primarily results from regional photochemical daytime production. Recent trend analyses do not show an improvement of surface ozone despite efforts by the State of Colorado to curb ozone precursor emissions. Our review of atmospheric volatile organic compound (VOC) measurements from historic and recent monitoring shows significant spatial increases of atmospheric VOC towards the oil and gas development area in Weld County, NW of the Denver-Boulder metropolitan region. Secondly, analyses of VOC trends and VOC signatures show an overall increase of oil and gas associated VOC relative to other VOC sources. These analyses suggest that oil and gas emissions are playing and increasing role in ozone production in the NCFR and that reductions of oil and gas emissions would be beneficial for lowering surface ozone and attainment of the ozone NAAQS.",

            "abstract": "Methane (CH4) fugitive emissions from fossil energy mining remain highly uncertain and scrutinized with the rapid expansion in domestic production by hydraulic fracturing. Top down observational studies of reported bottom up inventories are limited, but the latter may be biased low. We focus on the Four Corners region of the Southwestern United States, a region with extensive coal bed methane production, to verify its current emissions. At our site we measured methane over a range of scales using ground-based, in-situ instruments and a Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS), which is part of the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON). Measurements of CH4 produced much higher concentrations of methane in this rural area than previously expected. The diurnal variation and wind direction dependence in the CH4 concentrations suggest a source location tied to topographically induced winds and consistent with oil and gas production.\nThis paper presents the results of WRF-Chem simulations that are performed to simulate methane concentrations in this region. Emissions from the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) indicate large CH4 emissions, associated with the gas production and distribution sector, in one 0.1 x 0.1 degree grid cell within the region and these emissions are employed in the simulations. A series of six simulations are run at two-month intervals during 2012. Each simulates a six-day time series to demonstrate the diurnal and seasonal characteristics of the methane concentrations that would be expected at the FTS location, from the sources reported in the EDGAR data set. The results of these simulations will be presented, along with the implications for interpretation of the FTS measurements. We will also interpret our FTS measurements of ethane (C2H6), which is emitted only from fossil fuel mining, to attribute leaks.",

            "abstract": "Samples from strata spanning the Triassic-Jurassic boundary in the classic sections at Kuhjoch and Kendlbach were studied by NAA to determine Ir levels, and the results compared to previously determined carbon isotope stratigraphy. Ir concentrations in the Kössen Formation are very low (< 10 pg/g), well below average crustal levels until the top of the formation, reaching levels of ~15 pg/g, in the T-bed at the top of the Eiberg Member. The Tiefengraben Member (Kendlbach Formation) is enriched in Ir in general relative to the strata below. The shift to higher levels is abrupt at the base of the member. Concentrations of 60 to 80 pg/g are typical through the entire thickness of the Schattwald Beds and into the gray Tiefengraben, peaking at 145 pg/g. Above 560 cm from the Tiefengraben base, concentrations decline gradually from 50 pg/g to ~30 pg/g. The analyses from the Kendlbach section compare well with those from Kuhjoch, with the same order of magnitude difference in Ir concentration between the Kössen and Kendlbach formations. The same range of Ir values (60 to 80 pg/g) is seen in the lower 200 cm of the Tiefengraben Member, with a significant decline seen above 220 cm.\nIn both sections, the initial increase in Ir corresponds to the initial carbon isotope excursion, considered the peak extinction horizon, but otherwise there is no clear correlation to the C-isotope data. The positive shift to background δ13C values is not accompanied by any noticeable change in Ir, however. There do appear (at least visually) to be smaller parallel shifts in both δ13C and Ir, but the shifts are of smaller magnitude. The difference between the Ir concentration in the Kössen and Kendlbach formations levels has a strong lithologic control; levels are very low carbonate versus elevated levels in siliclastics, but variations within the Kendlbach Formation are independent of lithology. Although there is no obvious evidence of volcanic input in the sections studied, we consider outgassing during eruptions of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province, which is widely accepted as the driver of Late Triassic extinctions, a viable hypothesis to explain the origin of the slightly elevated Ir levels.",

            "abstract": "Low-energy electrons are accelerated to relativistic energies through different mechanisms, transporting them across their drift shells to the outer radiation belt. Among the different acceleration mechanisms, radial diffusion describes the result of ULF magnetic field pulsations resonantly interacting with radiation belt electrons. In this paper, the radial positioning of the relativistic electron population during 39 intense and moderate magnetic storms is examined against that of ULF Pc5 wave power and the plasmapause location. The relativistic electron population of the outer radiation belt appeared enhanced in the 2 - 6 MeV electron flux data from SAMPEX and in > 2 MeV electron flux data from the geosynchronous GOES satellites following 27 of the magnetic storms. We compared relativistic electrons observations with concurrent radial distribution of wave power enhancements at Pc5 frequencies as detected by the IMAGE and CARISMA magnetometer arrays, as well as by additional magnetic stations collaborating in SuperMAG. We discuss the growth and decay characteristics of Pc5 waves in association with the plasmapause location, determined from IMAGE EUV observations, as the controlling factor for wave power penetration deep into the magnetosphere. We show that, during magnetic storms characterized by increased post-storm fluxes, Pc5 wave power penetrates to L shells of 4 and lower. On the other hand, magnetic storms which were characterised by loss of electrons were related to low Pc5 wave activity, which was not intensified at low L shells. These observations provide support for the hypothesis that enhanced Pc5 wave activity deep into the magnetosphere during the main and recovery phase can discriminate between storms that result in increases of electron fluxes from those that do not.\nThe work leading to this paper has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7-SPACE-2011-1) under grant agreement no. 284520 for the MAARBLE (Monitoring, Analyzing and Assessing Radiation Belt Energization and Loss) collaborative research project.",

            "abstract": "Tropical cyclones (TCs) are a hazard to life and property and a prominent element of the global climate system, thus understanding and predicting their intensity, frequency and possible impacts is of paramount importance to the society. In coastal cities, the determination of the levels of defense against flooding is based on the best estimate of the probability of the hurricane induced storm surge. This certainly involves estimating the probability that a hurricane will pass within some given radius of the point in question, yet there are too few such events in the historical record to infer robust probabilities from the data alone, casting at least some doubt on the historical estimates. Recent research efforts have indicated that one partial solution to this problem is to generate a very large number of synthetic hurricanes, whose most important statistical properties conform to those of historical events. This work presents a cascade modelling approach for the prediction of storm surges in Mexico. The approach involves the numerical simulations of wind, waves and hydrodynamics induced by 3100 synthetic hurricane tracks, in comparison to that determined from the historical events. For this, wind fields are used as forcing in a third generation wave model and a 2D hydrodynamic model, enabling the characterization of hurricane conditions from the synthetic events. For several coastal locations on Mexico, we present a comparison of the estimates with this approach against those directly derived from historical hurricane data. The results suggest that such modelling approach opens the door towards a robust dynamical forecast of TC induced storm surges.",

            "abstract": "We present a comprehensive global comparison of seismic velocity, axial depth, and basalt composition along mid-ocean ridges to test whether the observations are most consistent with variations in mantle composition or mantle temperature. To compare to the seismic models, we have assembled a new global data set of major- and trace-element concentrations for 16,694 MORB samples from the published data archived in PetDB and GeoRoc as well as unpublished analyses. We first identified the individual segments of the global ridge system, using shipboard and satellite bathymetry in GeoMapApp, on the basis of first- and higher-order segmentation features. For ridge segments containing MORB samples from >2 unique locations, the major-element compositions were corrected for low-pressure fractionation to MgO = 8 wt. %. This resulted in fractionation-corrected composition estimates for 246 ridge segments.\nThe seismic models and ridge observations are strongly correlated. The correlation between axial ridge depth and shear velocity is largest for mantle depths 300-400 km and remains >0.6 to ~600 km. The correlation between Na90 and shear velocity is largest at 225 km and remains statistically significant to depths > 400 km. Using predictions of shear velocity, isostatic calculations for ridges, and mantle melting models, we show that the global correlation between the three data sets requires 250-degree variation in temperature beneath ridges extending to depths >300 km and cannot be reconciled with variations in composition at nearly constant temperature. High temperatures are mostly associated with upwelling mantle plumes. Cold downwellings, which are longer-wavelength features, are less often sampled by mid-ocean ridges. This finding addresses outstanding questions regarding the cause of along-ridge variations in axial depth and chemistry, and it provides calibration for the temperature sensitivity of shear velocity, allowing estimates of mantle temperature from tomographic models away from ridges.",

            "abstract": "Running simulations is an involved process taking many hours of computational time to complete. With the advent of cluster computing and parallel processing, problems may be solved in much less time compared to those run in serial. Specifically, NVIDIA released the parallel computing platform CUDA in 2007 giving researchers and programmers access to the GPU to solve generalized problems, and not those of just images.\nIn current research, code has previously been developed to study the interaction of the heliosphere and heavy atoms from the local interstellar medium.\nIonized species of hydrogen, helium and other heavy atoms are deflected by the heliosphere where as the neutral species are relatively unimpeded. Charge exchange of these neutral particles may occur between ionized species originating from the solar wind or other populations of pickup ions (PUI) modifying the shape and properties of the heliosphere, compared to one without neutrals. The details of the charge exchange interaction are element dependent and need to be investigated one by one. Current research has studied the interaction of local interstellar hydrogen with the heliosphere quite extensively with theory, simulations and modeling.\nSince hydrogen is the most abundant element care must be taken when coupling MHD equations with the charge exchange interactions. Simulation code has been developed to account for this dynamic problem and they have shown that the shape of the heliosphere is affected by this. Interstellar atoms heavier than hydrogen interacting with the heliosphere has been looked at as well, but not nearly with as much detail or sophisticated models as hydrogen. The heavy atom data collected by IBEX has in this sense been under-utilized by models.\nPreviously, the simulation was computed with the use of MPI (Message Passing Interface) for parallelization. This approach provided a decrease in computational time. However, CUDA enables the programmer to take advantage of the computer's hardware allowing for more code/memory optimization. The results of this work demonstrate a respectable decrease in computation time of the CUDA code compared to the MPI code. In addition, the distribution, temperature, and direction of primary and secondary ions and neutrals were found for that of helium and oxygen in and around the heliosphere.",

            "abstract": "The Blue Nile, a major tributary of the Nile River, extensively incised the long-wavelength Ethiopian Plateau developed within the East African Rift System, exposing various rock formations ranging in age from Neoproterozoic to Recent. The 1.6 km deep Blue Nile Canyon, the only deep and extensive canyon in the greater Nile drainage basin, characterizes the plateau, which has an average elevation of 2.5 km. The time line of the plateau uplift is still not well understood, and has been highly contested, with some suggesting early (before 20 Ma) and others arguing late (after 10 Ma) rise of the plateau. A recent modeling of deep-mantle convection beneath the African continent showed that the Ethiopian Plateau started to rise rapidly around 10 Ma. Quantifying the incision history of the Ethiopian Plateau is critical in unraveling the causes and timing of plateau’s elevation gain.\nLow temperature thermochronology provides a rigorous analytical tool in determining the cooling history to reconstruct canyon incision. From apatite (U-Th)/He ages measured from Neoproterozoic basement rocks and Mesozoic sedimentary strata exposed along the valley wall of the Blue Nile canyon, we investigate rock cooling history of the Ethiopian Plateau induced by this canyon incision. Although our apatite He dates show strong data dispersion, both within and among samples and ranging from 58 to 460 Ma, these ages positively correlate with apatite effective uranium concentrations. Hence, this age dispersion is likely linked to changes in helium retention and diffusivity related to differential accumulation of radiation damage. Our inverse thermal model simulations determine the best-fit cooling history that shows the onset of major canyon incision after 30 Ma with regional exhumation accelerated after 15 Ma. These observations are also supported by our quantitative geomorphic data extracted from the Blue Nile tributaries that correlates with mantle tomography data.",

            "abstract": "Changes in land use have caused a net release of carbon to the atmosphere over the last centuries and decades1. On one hand, agriculture accounts for 52% and 84% of global anthropogenic methane and nitrous oxide emissions, respectively. On the other hand, many agricultural practices can potentially mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the most prominent of which are improved cropland and grazing land management2. From this perspective, land use change that reduces emissions and/or increases carbon sequestration can play an important role in climate change mitigation.\nAs shown in Figure 1, this paper is an integrated study of climate impacts, land uses, and regional carbon changes to examine, link and assess climate impacts on regional carbon changes via impacts on land uses. This study will contribute to previous research in two aspects: impacts of climate change on future land uses under an uncertain future world and projections of regional carbon dynamics due to changes in future land use. Specifically, we will examine how land use change under historical climate change using observed data and then project changes in land use under future climate projections from 14 Global Climate Models (GCMs) for two emission scenarios (i.e., RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). More importantly, we will investigate future land use under uncertainties with changes in agricultural development and social-economic conditions along with a changing climate. By doing this, we then could integrate with existing efforts by USGS land-change scientists developing and parameterizing models capable of projecting changes across a full spectrum of land use and land cover changes and track the consequences on ecosystem carbon to provide better information for land managers and policy makers when informing climate change adaptation and mitigation policies.",

            "abstract": "We quantify the loss of radiation belt electrons into Earth’s atmosphere with measurements from the Radiation Belt Storm Probes – Energetic Particle, Composition, and Thermal plasma (RBSP-ECT) instrument suite onboard NASA’s Van Allen Probes mission. Understanding the relative importance of radiation belt enhancements and decreases relies on a quantitative assessment of the state of the belts. For instance, estimates of electron loss through precipitation into the atmosphere only become meaningful when compared to the total belt population. Previous studies used observations to quantify the total number of energetic electrons in the Van Allen belts. Baker et al. (2004) used measurements from the low altitude SAMPEX mission to estimate the radiation belt content, while Selesnick and Kanekal (2009) used high altitude NASA/Polar measurements. Our work extends these pioneering studies by taking advantage of measurements from RBSP-ECT, providing complete coverage of electron energy and pitch angle, near the magnetic equator, and with sufficiently high time cadence. We integrate the electrons measured by RBSP-ECT over energy and pitch angle throughout the belts every half orbit on each spacecraft to establish a quantitative estimate of the total radiation belt electron content (TRBEC) and its time variation. We identify a several week period in March 2013 during which TRBEC slowly decayed following an impulsive enhancement. Over that interval, electron phase space density profiles with L* are consistent with inward radial diffusion conditions, at all first and second invariants, with no indications of significant local acceleration or impulsive injections. From this slowly-evolving, quiet interval, we may thus constrain the total amount that was lost through precipitation to the atmosphere in the global system. In the absence of new sources, and assuming only the one sink in such a state, we effectively quantify the efficiency of the “drain” (precipitation loss to the atmosphere) by watching the TRBEC level decrease with time from the radiation belt electron reservoir. We compare this loss estimate with previous estimates and, finally, discuss the implications of this energetic electron precipitation on atmospheric chemistry.",

Rapidly growing oil and natural gas (O&NG) operations in the Denver-Julesberg Basin, NNE of the Denver metropolitan area, continue to be one of the largest volatile organic compound emitting sources in the region. Trend analysis of the last 13 years of Denver/NCFR ozone monitoring from five sites does not show any statistically significant decrease in annual regulated ozone maxima despite state efforts to mitigate ozone precursor emissions. In this work, we investigate the contribution of O&NG emissions to continued exceedances of the ozone NAAQS. We use surface ozone and wind data from two sites near Boulder, Colorado, to investigate the climatology of ozone in the NCFR region. Transport analyses show a preponderance of elevated ozone events associated with transport from the O&NG operations area in the N-ESE sector, rather than from the more densely populated Denver metro area to the SE-S. On average, between the two sites, air transport from areas associated with dense O&NG operations accounts for 65% of 1-hr averaged elevated ozone (>75 ppbv), while transport from the densely populated Denver metropolitan area accounts for only 9%.",

            "abstract": "The area of West Bohemia/Vogtland in western Eger Rift is typified by earthquake swarm activity with maximum magnitudes not exceeding ML 5. The seismicity is dominated by the area near Novy Kostel where earthquakes cluster along a narrow and steeply dipping focal zone of 8 km length that strikes about N-S in the depth range 7-11 km. Detailed seismic monitoring has been carried out by the WEBNET seismic network since 1992. During that period earthquake swarms with several mainshocks exceeding magnitude level ML 3 took place in 2000, 2008 and 2011. These swarms were characteristic by episodic character where the activity of individual episodes overlapped in time and space. Interestingly, the rate of activity of individual swarms increased with each subsequent swarm; the 2000 swarm being the slowest and the 2011 swarm the most rapid one. In 2014 the character of seismicity has changed from a swarm-like activity to a mainshock-aftershock activity. Already three mainshocks has occurred since May 2014; the ML 3.6 event of May 24, the ML 4.5 event of May 31 and the ML 3.5 event of August 3. All these events were followed by a short aftershock sequence of one to four days duration. All three events exceeded the following aftershocks by more than one magnitude level and none of these mainshocks were preceded by foreshocks, which differentiates this activity from the preceding swarm seismicity. Interestingly, the hypocenters of the mentioned earthquake swarms and mainshock-aftershock sequences share a common fault zone and overlap significantly.\nWe present detailed analysis of precise hypocenter locations and statistical characteristics of the activity in order to find the origin of different behavior of seismic activity, which results in either earthquake swarms or mainshock-aftershock activity.",

            "abstract": "NSF and other funders have supported the development of undergraduate STEM educational innovations over the past decades, only to see many yield limited uptake and impact beyond the grantee institutions. Numerous factors contribute to this complex problem, but one cause is likely insufficient incorporation of the understanding of how innovations propagate into project design. Following J.W. Dearing and colleagues, “dissemination” can be characterized by “push” approaches, which mainly emphasize one-to-many information sharing. In TUES/CCLI proposals, dissemination strategies have commonly taken the form of the “3 Ps” (presenting, publishing and posting) , with overall modest impact. Since the seminal work of Everett Rogers, however, “diffusion” of innovations has been understood as an inherently social process among potential adopters, which interacts with community norms and existing practices. Keys to diffusion include close understanding of the needs and context of the potential-adopter community and the development of “pull” within it, as well as support for implementation of innovations.\nPotential approaches to facilitating diffusion of innovations include a) using “lean start-up” methodologies (e.g., NSF’s I-Corps-L program), in which explicit business-model hypotheses are tested through customer-discovery interviews, commonly leading to pivots where initial hypotheses are not confirmed, b) providing a range of potential commitment levels for adopters tailored to levels of support (“reverse Kickstarter model”), c) supporting decentralized communities of practice in which adaptations and tacit knowledge can readily be shared, d) encouraging crowd-sourcing of innovations, with an “architecture of participation” informed by successful open-source projects, and e) integrating innovations with discipline-based educational research, e.g., big-data approaches which allow A/B testing and analysis of clickstream data that reveal behaviors along a novice-to-expert continuum. Such new directions will be facilitated by stronger partnerships with technologists and data scientists, as well as community development of learning objectives and assessment standards that are sufficiently flexible and transparent and allow rapid feedback.",

The need to understand how managed ecosystems respond to climate is intensified by uncertainty associated with knowing when, where, and how long drought conditions will manifest. Analysis of broad scale patterns in ecosystem productivity can inform our understanding of ecosystem dynamics and improve predictions for responses to climate extremes. We leveraged observations of plant biomass at a long-term ecological research site in southern New Mexico to verify the use of NDVI time-series as a proxy for landscape productivity from 13 years of MODIS data. The period between 2000 and 2013 encompassed years of sustained drought (2000-2003) and record-breaking high rainfall (2006 and 2008) that yielded decreases followed by increases in biomass with a restructuring of plant communities. We decomposed patterns derived from the 250m MODIS NDVI product over this period into contributions from the long-term trend, seasonal cycle, and unexplained variance using the Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) model to identify significant deviations from the modelled trend and seasonal components. Observed breakpoints in NDVI trend and seasonal components were verified with field estimates of species-specific biomass data at 15 sites. We found that breaks in the trend reflected large changes in mean biomass and seasonal breaks reflected changes in dominance of perennial grasses, shrubs, and/or annual grasses. The BFAST method proved useful for detecting observed state changes in this arid ecosystem. The ability to distinguish between long-term phenological change and temporal variability is strongly needed in water-limited ecosystems with high inter-annual variability in primary productivity. We demonstrate that time-series analysis of NDVI data holds potential for monitoring landscape condition at spatial scales needed to generate indicators for ecosystem responses to changing climate.",

The Pará River sub-basin, located in the upper São Francisco river basin, in southeastern Brazil, was selected for developing the studies. In this paper, we used the Rio Grande conceptual hydrologic model (EHR/UFMG, 2001) and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation method named DREAM (VRUGT, 2008a). Two probabilistic models for the residues were analyzed: (i) the classic [Normal likelihood – r ≈ N (0, σ²)]; and (ii) a generalized likelihood (SCHOUPS & VRUGT, 2010), in which it is assumed that the differences between observed and simulated flows are correlated, non-stationary, and distributed as a Skew Exponential Power density. The assumptions made for both models were checked to ensure that the estimation of uncertainties in the parameters was not biased. The results showed that the Bayesian approach proved to be adequate to the proposed objectives, enabling and reinforcing the importance of assessing the uncertainties associated with hydrological modeling.",

            "abstract": "Discussion with students about the science of global warming and the consequences of greenhouse gas emissions – while emitting greenhouse gasses in the process – is a focal point for geoethics in the Cornell University Earth and Environmental Systems (EES) Field Program. If we seek to educate students in the fundamentals of environmental stewardship we must also put stewardship into practice as part of that education. The EES program is a semester length earth systems field program held on Hawai`i Island. In Hawai`i students gain first-hand experience with the interconnected solid earth, living earth, ocean and atmosphere. They also gain first-hand experience with the consequences of unsustainable resource use: marine resource depletion, deforestation and species loss, development v. conservation, fossil fuel v. alternative energy options. Yet as a travel-based field program the pursuit of these goals carries a clear environmental cost. Thus a core element of EES education is to run a carbon-neutral program. To achieve this, students quantify every aspect of the program’s carbon footprint. They decide which actions they must include as part of that footprint and learn how to monitor and calculate the resulting CO2 emissions. Students learn how to reduce emissions where possible, and offset emissions that cannot be eliminated. Working in partnership with island-based conservation organizations students engage in reforestation of degraded native forest landscapes. They model the carbon sequestration capacity of restored forest biomass and soil reservoirs. The outcome of this process has triple-bottom-line benefits: (1) native forest and endangered species habitat is restored, (2) carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere and sequestered, and (3) students gain hands-on, minds-on experience with carbon-cycle science, ecosystem science, and with the ethical imperative of putting one’s knowledge into action.",

            "abstract": "Seismic event amplitude estimation plays an important role in a range of endeavors including the discrimination between earthquakes and explosions and seismic hazard estimation. Reasonable amplitude estimation requires knowledge of the attenuation experienced by seismic waves as they travel through the earth. In this study, we investigate the attenuation structure in the region of Southern Nevada as part of the Source Physics Experiment (SPE). The SPE consists of a series of chemical explosions at the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS) designed to improve our understanding of explosion physics and enable better modeling of explosion sources. Phase I of the SPE is currently being conducted in the Climax Stock Granite and Phase II will move to a contrasting dry alluvium geology. Phase III is planned to be a direct earthquake-to-explosion comparison in Rock Valley at the southern end of NNSS. For the Rock Valley experiment, a chemical explosion would be placed at the hypocenter of a small shallow earthquake and recorded at a common set of receivers. A sequence of unusually shallow events along the Rock Valley Fault Zone in May of 1993 was recorded by a network of stations operated by the University of Nevada-Reno (UNR) and makes this novel experiment possible. As part of a feasibility study for this phase of the SPE, LLNL, UNR and NSTec are working to improve our understanding of the region and the propagation of energy from sources in the area to local and regional stations in the western U.S. Eight new seismic stations, including two borehole sensors, located at the original 1993 sites and additional sites, have been installed and ongoing seismicity along the fault is currently being recorded.\nExamination of the local attenuation structure is an important part of our site characterization. We wish to ensure that an explosion generated at a Rock Valley site will be large enough to be recorded at regional distances, and a well-constrained attenuation study will aid us in all our SPE modeling efforts. We simultaneously invert regional phases Pn, Pg, and Lg (e.g. Pasyanos et al. 2009) to examine the crust and upper mantle structure of southern Nevada and surrounding region.\nThis work performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.",

            "abstract": "The roles and interactions of processes that generate bedforms in soluble bedrock settings are not yet fully understood. One outstanding puzzle is the morphogenesis of scallops. Current chemical theory does not allow dissolution rate to spatially vary under many of the conditions at which scallops are thought to form. This lack of variation in dissolution rate disagrees with the creation and existence of scallops for a large portion of the range of scallop sizes that are found in nature. Previous studies that have examined processes that generate bedforms using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) have made simplifying assumptions to ensure tractability. Consequently, tractability is sacrificed and some fine scale effects associated with the driving processes are not modeled. We incorporate Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) and adaptive meshing into a lattice-Boltzmann CFD method for fluid flow, chemical dissolution, and solute transport allowing relaxation of simplifying assumptions employed in previous models. These methods can model sub-grid scale turbulence and resolve the dissolution and precipitation processes occurring at the fluid-solid interface. We use this CFD model to simulate flow and dissolution over scallops and flutes to investigate the formational processes responsible for variations in dissolution rate that drive the spatio-temporal evolution of these features.",

Many techniques and approaches are available to determine representative source parameters of these events. For M > 3.5 events, high quality seismic data from regional networks can be used to provide reasonable estimates of moment tensor solutions. In this investigation we explore various techniques and datasets to constrain full moment tensor solutions of M < 3.5 induced events, expanding upon the approach developed by Guilhem et al., 2014.\nSmall magnitude events recorded by local seismic networks can yield good quality data with distinct body wave and converted phases depending upon the velocity structure and frequency range. Generating synthetic seismograms or Green’s functions to accurately model these high frequency phases can be challenging. To investigate the variability associated with the choice of Green’s functions, we test available codes to see how well they capture body wave phases. Other stability and uncertainty measures include the F-test, Jackknife test, residual bootstrap, and Network Sensitivity Solution, (Ford et al., 2009; Ford et al., 2010). Additional datasets to constrain the full moment tensor solution include P-wave first motions and amplitude ratios.",

            "abstract": "Stordalen mire is located at 68°21’N and 19°02’E in the Swedish subarctic. Climate monitoring has revealed a warming trend spanning the past 150 years affecting the mires ability to hold stable palsa/hummock mounds. The micro-topography of the landscape has begun to degrade into thaw ponds changing the vegetation cover from ombrothrophic to minerotrophic. Hummocks are ecologically important due to their ability to act as a carbon sinks. Thaw ponds and sphagnum rich transitional zones have been documented as sources of atmospheric CH4. An objective of this project is to determine if a high resolution three band camera (RGB) and a RGNIR camera could detect differences in vegetation over five different site types.\nSpecies composition was collected for 50 plots with ten repetitions for each site type: palsa/hummock, tall shrub, semi-wet, tall graminoid, and wet. Sites were differentiated based on dominating species and features consisting of open water presence, sphagnum spp. cover, graminoid spp. cover, or the presence of dry raised plateaus/mounds. A pole based camera mount was used to collect images at a height of ~2.44m from the ground. The images were cropped in post-processing to fit a one-square meter quadrat. Texture analysis was performed on all images, including entropy, lacunarity, and angular second momentum.\nPreliminary results suggested that site type influences the number of species present. The p-values for the ability to predict site type using a t-test range from <0.0001 to 0.0461. A stepwise discriminant analysis on site type vs. texture yielded a 10% misclassification rate. Through the use of a stepwise regression of texture variables, actual vs. predicted percent of vegetation coverage provided R squared values of 0.73, 0.71, 0.67, and 0.89 for C. bigelowii, R. chamaemorus, Sphagnum spp., and open water respectively. These data have provided some support to the notion that texture analyses can be used for classification of mire site types.\nFuture work will involve scaling up from the 50 plots through the use of data collected from two unmanned aerial systems (UAS), as well as WorldView-2 satellite imagery collected during the years 2012-2014. Identification of methane flux regions will later be analyzed based on vegetation coverage to aid classification of increased emission zones within the mire.",

            "abstract": "We describe the modeling of tsunami inundation for the Upper US East Coast (USEC) from Ocean City, MD up to Nantucket, MA. and the development of inundation maps for use in emergency management and hazard analysis. Seven tsunami sources were used as initial conditions in order to develop inundation maps based on a Probable Maximum Tsunami approach. Of the seven, two coseismic sources were used; the first being a large earthquake in the Puerto Rico Trench, in the well-known Caribbean Subduction Zone, and the second, an earthquake close to the Azores Gibraltar plate boundary known as the source of the biggest tsunami recorded in the North Atlantic Basin. In addition, four Submarine Mass Failure (SMF) sources located at different locations on the edge of the shelf break were simulated. Finally, the Cumbre Vieja Volcanic (CVV) collapse, located in the Canary Islands, was studied.\nFor this presentation, we discuss modeling results for nearshore tsunami propagation and onshore inundation. A fully nonlinear Boussinesq model (FUNWAVE-TVD) is used to capture the characteristics of tsunami propagation, both nearshore and inland. In addition to the inundation line as the main result of this work, other tsunami quantities such as inundation depth and maximum velocities will be discussed for the whole USEC area. Moreover, a discussion of most vulnerable areas to a possible tsunami in the USEC will be provided. For example, during the inundation simulation process, it was observed that coastal environments with barrier islands are among the hot spots to be significantly impacted by a tsunami. As a result, areas like western Long Island, NY and Atlantic City, NJ are some of the locations that will get extremely affected in case of a tsunami occurrence in the Atlantic Ocean. Finally, the differences between various tsunami sources modeled here will be presented. Although inundation lines for different sources usually follow a similar pattern, there are clear distinctions between the inundation depth and other tsunami features in different areas. Figure below shows the inundation depth for surrounding area of the Ocean City, MD. Figure (a) and (b) are the envelope inundation depth for SMF and coseismic sources. Figure (C) shows the inundation depth for CVV source, which clearly has the largest magnitude amongst the sources studied for this work.",

            "abstract": "Peatlands cover approximately 3% of the Earth’s surface, but account for approximately one-third of terrestrial soil carbon. This carbon is also much older, collected over hundreds to thousands of years, than other commonly encountered wildfire fuels such as Ponderosa Pine (i.e., years to decades). Due to the moisture and mineral content of peat it has a propensity to smolder, unlike Ponderosa Pine which has an intense flaming period when burning. To better understand the emission from peat fires, in comparison to Ponderosa Pine, a series of experiments were performed in the 8 m3 combustion chamber located at the Desert Research Institute in Reno, NV. Peat from Alaska and Florida (USA) and Siberia (Russia) were burned at two moisture content levels (25 & 50%). Ponderosa Pine needles from Sierra Nevada sites were burned at one moisture content level (8.2%). Real-time measurements included gaseous carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx = NO + NO2), and ozone (O3) concentration, as well as particulate matter (PM) mass, size distribution, and black carbon concentration. In addition, Teflon-membrane and quartz-fiber filters as well as Teflon-impregnated glass fiber (TIGF) filters followed by XAD-4 cartridges were collected for detailed PM chemical speciation. Changes in fuel mass and combustion temperature were continuously monitored during each experiment. We will present a comparison of mass-based emission factors of inorganic gases, PM and black carbon mass concentrations, organic and elemental carbon, and a number of intermediate-volatility (300<saturation mass concentration, C*<3x106 μg m-3) and semi-volatile (0.3<C*<300 μg m-3) polar organic compounds (POCs) in gas- and particle-phases. Implications for secondary organic aerosol formation in smoke plumes will be discussed. Because fire regimes are expected to increase, an improved understanding of their emissions will enable us to better forecast their impacts on local and regional climate and air quality.",

            "abstract": "Numerical hydrological models are essential tools for the retrieval of water information in many societal sectors. Although such models are usually applied at a catchment scale, there is an increasing need to model large spatial domains to be able to manage resources in a coordinated manner. However, modeling a large spatial domain brings with it a number of challenges. One of the issues that needs to be addressed is estimation of the model parameters under a situation where the physical and climate characteristics of the catchments making up the model domain are highly variable. A semi-distributed continuous hydrological model HYPE is applied to model daily stream flows over the entire pan-European region. The model includes simplified components to simulate human impacts, such as irrigation, reservoir regulation, and water abstraction. The entire region was subdivided into more than 35,000 subcatchments and a catchment classification scheme was implemented to group catchments based on similarity of their physiographic and climate characteristics. A range of catchment physiographic and climate attributes were used and principal component analysis was employed to reduce the dimensionality. These attributes were iteratively selected so that catchments of the same group have one or more of their hydrological signatures similar. The model parameters were estimated using a regionalization approach. Soil and landuse parameters were fixed based on soil and landuse classes respectively. Lake and irrigation parameters were estimated separately. Model parameters that are defined at a catchment scale were estimated for each group as functions of the catchment physical and climate characteristics. Simultaneous calibration was performed on a number of catchments to optimize the overall model performance and the functional relationships between the parameters and the catchment properties. ERA-interim reanalysis forcings were used as climate drivers and MODIS products were used to constrain the evapotranspiration parameters. Around 3,000 gauging stations were used to calibrate and validate the regionalization scheme. The regionalized parameters were evaluated by testing the performance on catchments that were not used in the derivation of the relationship and good results were obtained.",

            "abstract": "One of the discoveries made by Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding (MARSIS) on the Mars Express spacecraft is the existence of magnetically controlled structures in the ionosphere of Mars, which result in irregularities in the ionospheric electron density contours. These irregularities lead in turn to oblique echoes, which show up as hyperbola-shaped features on the plots of echo intensity measured by MARSIS as a function of altitude and universal time. The study of a hyperbola-shaped feature observed in a pass over an isolated region of strong crustal magnetic field shows that this kind of feature can be associated with a plasma cavity in the upper ionosphere and a corresponding density enhancement in the lower levels of the ionosphere. At the location where the hyperbola-shaped echo is observed, the electron and ion fluxes measured by ASPERA-3 at the location of the spacescraft are depleted and the local electron density from MARSIS shows a small decrease, as well. However, the peak ionospheric density obtained by MARSIS remote sounding shows a clear increase as Mars Express passes over the same region. We conclude that through the open magnetic field lines, the electrons are accelerated downward and ions are accelerated upward in a manner similar to the field-line driven auroral acceleration at Earth. This heating due to precipitating electrons causes a bulge at the altitude of the main ionosphere, which in turn leads to a hyperbola shaped echo, and loss of ionospheric plasma at high altitudes.",

            "abstract": "Recent attempts to accelerate cloud superparameterization for climate simulation by using reduced cloud resolving model (CRM) extents unsatisfyingly amplify upper tropospheric temperature biases and liquid water condensate. The effect of scale coupling frequency, fscale, is investigated as a candidate strategy to remedy these biases by compensating for CRM-trapped subsidence. Significant sensitivity to fscale is found in the 10-year climatology of a superparameterized version of NCAR Community Atmosphere Model 3.0. Higher fscale improves both long wave cloud forcing (LWCF) and short wave cloud forcing (SWCF) in a systematic manner that scales quasi-linearly with increased fscale. In addition, a systematic quasi-linear mid-tropospheric warming associated with faster updraft is observed with higher fscale. These improvements suggest fscale is a useful tuning parameter in superparamtereized global climate models to improve mean state cloud forcing biases and can help remedy the too cold mid-troposphere thermal bias associated with the trapped subsidence when using reduced CRM setups. However, inconsistent LWCF response with ice water path (IWP), e.g. lower LWCF with more IWP, and confounding surface flux responses, e.g. increasing surface flux with fscale, need be further investigated.",

            "abstract": "The exchangeability of methane for carbon dioxide in gas hydrates opens the possibility of producing emission-neutral hydrocarbon energy. Recent field tests have shown that the production of natural gas from gas hydrates is feasible via injection of carbon dioxide into sandy, methane-hydrate-bearing sediment strata. Industrial-scale application of this method requires identification of thermo- and fluid-dynamic as well as kinetic controls on methane yield from and carbon dioxide retention within the reservoir. Extraction of gas via injection of carbon dioxide into the hydrate reservoir triggers a number of macroscopic effects, which are revealed for example by changes of the hydraulic conductivity and geomechanical stability. Thus far, due to analytical limitations, localized reactions and fluid-flow phenomena held responsible for these effects remain unresolved on the microscale (1 µm – 1 mm) and at near-natural reservoir conditions. We address this deficit by showing results from high-resolution, two-dimensional Raman spectroscopy mappings of an artificial hydrate reservoir during carbon dioxide injection under realistic reservoir conditions. The experiments allow us to resolve hydrate conversion rate and efficiency as well as activation of fluid pathways in space and time and their effect on methane yield, carbon-dioxide retention and hydraulic conductivity of the reservoir. We hypothesize that the conversion of single hydrate grains is a diffusion-controlled process which starts at the grain surface before continuing into the grain interior and show that the conversion can be modeled simply by using published permeation coefficients for CO2 and CH4 in hydrate and grain size as only input parameters.",

However, the impact of soil property uncertainty on these projections may be significant. In this research, we evaluate the contribution of soil property uncertainty on ALT projections at the Barrow Environmental Observatory, Alaska. The effect of variations in porosity, thermal conductivity, saturation, and water retention properties of peat and mineral soil are evaluated. The micro-topography of ice wedge polygons present at the site is included in the analysis using three 1D column models to represent polygon center, rim and trough features. The Arctic Terrestrial Simulator (ATS) is used to model multiphase thermal and hydrological processes in the subsurface. We apply the Null-Space Monte Carlo (NSMC) algorithm to identify an ensemble of soil property combinations that produce simulated temperature profiles that are consistent with temperature measurements available from the site. ALT is simulated for the ensemble of soil property combinations for four climate scenarios. The uncertainty in ALT due to soil properties within and across climate scenarios is evaluated.

            "abstract": "As the largest group of fresh water bodies on Earth, the Laurentian Great Lakes have significant influence on local and regional weather and climate through their unique physical features compared with the surrounding land. Due to the limited spatial resolution and computational efficiency of general circulation models (GCMs), the Great Lakes are geometrically ignored or idealized into several grid cells in GCMs. Thus, the nested regional climate modeling (RCM) technique, known as dynamical downscaling, serves as a feasible solution to fill the gap. The latest Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) is employed to dynamically downscale the historical simulation produced by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory-Coupled Model (GFDL-CM3) from 1970-2005. An updated lake scheme originated from the Community Land Model is implemented in the latest WRF version 3.6. It is a one-dimensional mass and energy balance scheme with 20-25 model layers, including up to 5 snow layers on the lake ice, 10 water layers, and 10 soil layers on the lake bottom. The lake scheme is used with actual lake points and lake depth. The preliminary results show that WRF-Lake model, with a fine horizontal resolution and realistic lake representation, provides significantly improved hydroclimates, in terms of lake surface temperature, annual cycle of precipitation, ice content, and lake-effect snowfall. Those improvements suggest that better resolution of the lakes and the mesoscale process of lake-atmosphere interaction are crucial to understanding the climate and climate change in the Great Lakes region.",

            "abstract": "Soils are dynamic natural bodies composed of mineral and organic materials. As a result of this mixed composition, essential properties of soils such as their apparent density, organic and mineral contents are typically correlated. Negative relationships between bulk density (Db) and organic matter concentration provide well-known examples across a broad range of soils, and such quantitative relationships among soil properties are useful for a variety of applications. First, gap-filling or data interpolation often are necessary to develop large soil carbon (C) datasets; furthermore, limitations of access to analytical instruments may preclude C determinations for every soil sample. In such cases, equations to derive soil C concentrations from basic measures of soil mass, volume, and density offer significant potential for purposes of soil C stock estimation. To facilitate estimation of soil C stocks on highly weathered soils of the Americas, I used observations from the International Soil Carbon Network (ISCN) database to develop carbon – bulk density prediction equations for Oxisols and Ultisols. Within a small sample set of georeferenced Oxisols (n=89), 29% of the variation in A horizon C concentrations can be predicted from Db. Including the A-horizon sand content improves predictive capacity to 35%. B horizon C concentrations (n=285) were best predicted by Db and clay content, but were more variable than A-horizons (only 10% of variation explained by linear regression). Among Ultisols, a larger sample set allowed investigation of specific horizons of interest. For example, C concentrations of plowed A (Ap) horizons are predictable based on Db, sand and silt contents (n=804, r2=0.38); gleyed argillic (Btg) horizon concentrations are predictable from Db, sand and clay contents (n=190, r2=0.23). Because soil C stock estimates are more sensitive to variation in soil mass and volume determinations than to variation in C concentration, prediction equations such as these may be used on carefully collected samples to constrain soil C stocks. The geo-referenced ISCN database allows users the opportunity to derive similar predictive relationships among measured soil parameters; continued input of new datasets from highly weathered soils of the Americas will improve the precision of these prediction equations.",

            "abstract": "Mantle temperature variation, plate spreading rate variation and mantle compositional variation have been considered to be the three fundamental variables that govern the working of global ocean ridges [1]. An analysis demonstrates that mantle compositional variation exerts the primary control on ocean ridge processes; it determines (1) variation in both composition and mode of mantle mineralogy, (2) variation of mantle density, (3) variation of ridge axial depth, (4) source-inherited MORB compositional variation, (4) density-controlled variation in the amplitude of mantle upwelling, (5) apparent variation in the extent of melting, and (6) the correlated variation of MORB chemistry with ridge axial depth [2]. The above interpretations are reinforced by the updated MORB database [3]. The new database also confirms spreading rate control on the extent of melting as shown previously [4]. Mantle temperature variation could play a part, but its overstated role [3,5] results from a basic error (1) in treating ridge axial depth variation as evidence of mantle temperature variation by ignoring the intrinsic control of mantle composition, (2) in treating “mantle plume” influenced ridges (e.g., Iceland) as normal ridges of plate spreading origin, and (3) in treating low Vs at greater depths (> 300 km vs. < 200 km beneath ridges) beneath these “mantle plume” influenced ridges as evidence for hot ridge mantle. In order to understand the working of global ocean ridges, we must avoid plume-influenced ridges (e.g., in the vicinity of Iceland) and remove/average out data from such ridges. As a result, the correlations (e.g., between ridge axial depth, mantle low Vs anomaly, and some geochemical parameters) required for the interpretation of mantle temperature control all disappear. There is thus no evidence for large mantle temperature variation away from ridges influenced by “mantle plumes”. ",

To spark student interest in the sciences early in their college career, the CIRES diversity initiative teamed with the Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory to build an REU for Colorado community college students.\nA group of 7 students was selected from consideration of diversity, prior training, and personal statements. Each student was paired with a research science mentor. Field excursions and team-building exercises filled the first week of the 8-week program. Students received weekly training in science communication, responsible conduct of research, use of spreadsheet and graphing software, and statistical analysis. Each student presented their research in a poster session, an oral presentation, and a written report.\nSeveral aspects of this pilot program worked well. The students formed a very supportive cohort, despite the fact that they were not in residence. Cohesion grew out of the immersion in field trips, and was reinforced with weekly check-ins. The trainings were essential for seeing projects through to written and oral presentations. Teaming students for fieldwork was an effective strategy to build support, and reduce mentor fatigue. Each student produced useful data.\nIn the future, we would include a workshop on personal finances to address a clear need. Transportation support will be provided. A residential program might attract some but could preclude participation of students with families or other life-issues. Personal tutoring tailored to research projects would address low math skills.\nAll 7 students completed the program; several elected to submit to the undergraduate virtual poster session at Fall AGU. Students all reported enormous personal and academic growth. Some are discussing transfer and graduate school opportunities with their mentors. The enthusiasm and appreciation of the students was unparalleled.",

            "abstract": "The double focussing mass spectrometer (DFMS), part of the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis (ROSINA) instrument package, consists of an ion source, a mass analyser and a detector assembly consisting of three detectors. The magnetic sector of the analyser provides the mass dispersion needed for use with the position-sensitive microchannel plate (MCP) detector. Ions that hit the MCP release electrons that are recorded using a linear electron detector array with 512 pixels (LEDA). Raw data for a given commanded mass are obtained as ADC counts as a function of pixel number. This contribution describes a computer-assisted approach to address the problem of calibrating such raw data, in other words, how to associate the pixel number to a mass-over-charge ratio (m/Z) and how to convert the ADC counts per pixel to ion counts per second.\nAfter calibration, the abundance and identity of ions at the detector are known. Neutral comet gases, however, are ionized in the ion source before they are transferred to the mass analyser and during this process fragmentation of the gas molecules may occur. Our software allows a tentative identification of the neutrals that entered the instrument, given the detected ion fragments and a fragmentation database. By taking into account experimentally determined sensitivities gas number densities are obtained.\nThe instrument characterisation (experimental determination of sensitivities, fragmentation patterns for the most common neutral species, etc.) has been conducted by the consortium using an instrument copy in the University of Bern test facilities.",

            "abstract": "The work presented here builds on the results of Grotheer & Livi [2014], which found that the majority of the vapor produced due to meteoroid impacts on Mercury is caused by meteoroids with masses 4.2 x 10-7 g ≤ m ≤ 8.3 x 10-2 g. Meteoroids with a mass of 2.1 x 10-4 g are the largest contributors to the vapor released by meteoroid impacts, thus here we focus on meteoroids with such masses as an input to a particle tracing simulation called the Hermean Exosphere Model of Oxygen (HEMO).\nThe HEMO simulations include 36 different particle species which can be released via meteoritic impact vaporization, based on the abundances determined by Berezhnoy & Klumov [2008]. After the initial simulation of the meteoroid impact, the released particles are affected by the gravitational pull of the planet Mercury, as well as the Sun’s radiation. Particles may be photoionized or in the case of molecules also photodissociated. Due to the effects of photodissociation, a total of 38 species are actually present in the simulation, since 2 species are not directly released by impact vaporization but may be created due to photodissociation.\nThese simulations record various pieces of information about each simulated particle, including position and velocity, for each time-step of the model. This information is then utilized to construct density profiles for each simulation run, as well as for aggregates of simulation runs with similar input parameters. The results are intended to aid the interpretation of results from the MESSENGER and BepiColombo missions to Mercury, with a particular focus on atomic and molecular oxygen.\n",

            "abstract": "Wildfires have profound, highly variable impacts on erosion, sediment transport, and stream channel morphology. Climate change and fuel management actions have altered the current fire regime relative to the historic fire regime. Many researchers have quantified post-fire geomorphic response immediately following events and also over millennial timescales using geochronologic techniques and field study. While these studies have informed our understanding of the post-fire geomorphic response during the dry and wet periods of the Holocene, there are still some fundamental questions about long-term landscape erosion that we have yet to answer, particularly in fire-dominated landscapes.\nThe Hayman fire burned 55,700 hectares in Pikes Peak National Forest, Colorado in 2002. Hillslope- and small watershed-scale sediment yield data were previously collected for 5 to 7 years in areas burned by high severity immediately after the fire. Plot data from 33 hillslope-scale plots indicate an average of 0.8 mm per year of erosion. Wildfires are common to this area and there is observable evidence of extreme geomorphic response following historic fires, similar to what has been monitored after the Hayman fire. In this study, we collected samples of channel alluvium deposited since the Hayman fire and sediment from alluvial fans thought to have been deposited in association with wildfires that may have occurred pre-European settlement. Samples were used to measure in-situ 10Be to estimate millennial-scale, catchment-averaged denudation rates that were compared to the erosion rates measured from the hillslope and watershed-scale plots to determine the proportion of erosion that is generated post-wildfire relative to undisturbed periods. Material from older alluvial fans was collected to try to evaluate whether denudation rates have changed and the ages of the older alluvial fans were determined using radiocarbon or optically-stimulated luminescence.",

The main objective of this research is to monitor the partitioning of the strain along the active splays of NAF. The occurrences of 1999 earthquakes also enabled to quantify co-seismic and post-seismic deformation in addition to the inter-seismic deformation. Furthermore, current network scheme allows to monitor the recently discovered aseismic creep along rupture of Izmit earthquake, which require near fault observations. Periodic observations at these micro-geodetic networks enable us to clarify how accumulated strain is distributed across spatial and temporal scales. In this study, we analyzed periodic GPS observations of these networks to derive velocity vectors and principal components of crustal strain rates. Estimated horizontal velocities relative to Eurasia are found to be in the range of 18-22mm/yr with an uncertainty level at the order of 1-2mm/yr. The principal strain rate axes show a dominant extension in NE-SW direction, and mostly negligible SE-NW direction of contraction.",

            "abstract": "The hydrogen isotopic composition of plant waxes in sediments is now routinely used as a hydroclimate proxy. This application is based largely on empirical calibrations that have demonstrated continental-scale correlations between source water and lipid hydrogen isotope values. But at smaller spatial scales and for individual locations it is increasingly recognized that factors that modify apparent fractionation between source water and leaf lipid hydrogen isotope values must also be considered. Isotopic enrichment of leaf water during transpiration is key among these secondary factors, and is itself sensitive to changes in hydroclimate. Leaf water enrichment also occurs prior to photosynthetic water uptake, and is therefore independent from cellular-level biomarker synthesis. Recent advances in theory have permitted mechanistic models to be developed that can be used to predict the mean leaf water hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition from readily available meteorological variables. This permits global-scale isoscape maps of leaf water isotopic composition and enrichment above source water to be generated, but these models have not been widely validated at continental spatial scales.\nWe have established a network of twenty-one sites across Europe where we are sampling for leaf-, xylem-, and soil-water isotopes (H and O) at approximately 5-week intervals over the summer growing season. We augment the sample set with weekly to monthly precipitation samples and early- and late-season plant wax lipid samples. Collaborators at each site are conducting the sampling, and most sites are members of the FLUXNET tower network that also record high-resolution meteorological data. We present information on the implementation of the network and preliminary results from the 2014 summer season. The complete dataset will be used to track the evolution of water isotopes from source to leaf water and from leaf water to lipid hydrogen across diverse environments. This will provide a more focused framework for understanding the environmental signal captured in leaf waxes, and will be used to refine models of isotopic processes within plants as well as the impact of these processes on surface and atmospheric water.",

            "abstract": "We present measurements of a large suite of gas and particle phase organic compounds made with a Filter Inlet for Gas and AEROsol (FIGAERO) coupled to a high resolution time of flight chemical ionization mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-CIMS) developed at the University of Washington and with airborne HR-ToF-CIMS measurements. The FIGAERO instrument was deployed on the Jülich Plant Atmosphere Chamber to study α-pinene oxidation, and subsequently at the SMEAR II forest station in Hyytiälä, Finland and the SOAS ground site, in Brent Alabama. During the Southern Atmosphere Study, a gas-phase only version of the HR-ToF-CIMS was deployed on the NOAA WP-3 aircraft as part of SENEX. We focus here on highly oxygenated organic compounds derived from monoterpene oxidation detected both aloft during SENEX and at the ground-based site during SOAS. In both chamber and the atmosphere, many highly oxidized, low volatility compounds were observed in the gas and particles and many of the same compositions detected in the gas-phase were detected in the particles upon temperature programmed thermal desorption. The fraction of a given compound measured in the particle phase follows expected trends with elemental composition such as O/C ratios, but many compounds would not be well described by an absorptive partitioning model assuming unity activity coefficients. The detailed structure in the thermograms reveals a significant contribution from large molecular weight organics and/or oligomers in both chamber and ambient aerosol samples. Approximately 50% of the measured organics in the particle phase are associated with compounds having effective vapour pressures 4 or more orders of magnitude lower than commonly measured monoterpene oxidation products. We discuss the implications of these findings for measurements of gas-particle partitioning and for evaluating the contribution of monoterpene oxidation to organic aerosol formation and growth. We also use the aircraft measurements and a steady state model to estimate the yield of such highly oxidized compounds from monoterpene oxidation.",

            "abstract": "According to the 5th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the model estimates of Radiative Forcing due to aerosol-radiation interactions (RFari) for individual aerosol types are less certain than the total RFari [Boucher et al., 2013]. For example, the RFari specific to Black Carbon (BC) is uncertain due to an underestimation of its mass concentration near source regions [Koch et al., 2009]. Several recent studies have evaluated chemical transport model (CTM) predictions using observations of aerosol optical properties such as Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) or Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) from satellite or ground-based instruments (e.g., Huneeus et al., [2010]). However, most passive remote sensing instruments fail to provide a comprehensive assessment of the particle type without further analysis and combination of measurements. To improve the predictions of aerosol composition in CTMs, we have developed an aerosol classification algorithm (called Specified Clustering and Mahalanobis Classification, SCMC) that assigns an aerosol type to multi-parameter retrievals by spaceborne, airborne or ground based passive remote sensing instruments [Russell et al., 2014]. The aerosol types identified by our scheme are pure dust, polluted dust, urban-industrial/developed economy, urban-industrial/developing economy, dark biomass smoke, light biomass smoke and pure marine. First, we apply the SCMC method to five years of clear-sky space-borne POLDER observations over Greece. We then use the aerosol extinction and SSA spectra retrieved from a combination of MODIS, OMI and CALIOP clear-sky observations to infer the aerosol type over the globe in 2007. Finally, we will extend the spaceborne aerosol classification from clear-sky to above low opaque water clouds using a combination of CALIOP AOD and backscatter observations and OMI absorption AOD values from near-by clear-sky pixels.",

            "abstract": "Nano-scale zero valent iron (nZVI) has been used at a number of contaminated sites over the last decade. At most of these sites, significant decreases in contaminant concentrations have resulted from the application of nZVI. However, limited work has been completed investigating nZVI mobility at the field-scale. In this study a three dimensional, three phase, finite difference numerical simulator (CompSim) was used to simulate nZVI and polymer transport in a variably saturated site. The model was able to accurately predict the field observed head data without parameter fitting. In addition, the numerical simulator estimated the amount of nZVI delivered to the saturated and unsaturated zones as well as the phase of nZVI (i.e., attached or aqueous phase). The simulation results showed that the injected slurry migrated radially outward from the injection well, and therefore nZVI transport was governed by injection velocity as well as viscosity of the injected solution. A suite of sensitivity analyses was performed to investigate the impact of different injection scenarios (e.g. different volume and injection rate) on nZVI migration. Simulation results showed that injection of a higher volume of nZVI delivered more iron particles at a given distance; however, not necessarily to a greater distance proportionate to the increase in volume. This study suggests that on-site synthesized nZVI particles are mobile in the subsurface and the numerical simulator can be a valuable tool for optimum design of nZVI applications.",

            "abstract": "Although a great deal of progress has been made with various arctic observing efforts, it can be difficult to assess such progress when so many agencies, organizations, research groups and others are making such rapid progress. To help meet the strategic needs of the U.S. SEARCH-AON program and facilitate the development of SAON and related initiatives, the Arctic Observing Viewer (AOV; http://ArcticObservingViewer.org) has been developed. This web mapping application compiles detailed information pertaining to U.S. Arctic Observing efforts. Contributing partners include the U.S. NSF, USGS, ACADIS, ADIwg, AOOS, a2dc, AON, ARMAP, BAID, IASOA, INTERACT, and others. Over 6100 sites are currently in the AOV database and the application allows users to visualize, navigate, select, advance search, draw, print, and more. AOV is founded on principles of software and data interoperability and includes an emerging “Project” metadata standard, which uses ISO 19115-1 and compatible web services. In the last year, substantial efforts have focused on maintaining and centralizing all database information. In order to keep up with emerging technologies and demand for the application, the AOV data set has been structured and centralized within a relational database; furthermore, the application front-end has been ported to HTML5. Porting the application to HTML5 will now provide access to mobile users utilizing tablets and cell phone devices. Other application enhancements include an embedded Apache Solr search platform which provides users with the capability to perform advance searches throughout the AOV dataset, and an administration web based data management system which allows the administrators to add, update, and delete data in real time. We encourage all collaborators to use AOV tools and services for their own purposes and to help us extend the impact of our efforts and ensure AOV complements other cyber-resources. Reinforcing dispersed but interoperable resources in this way will help to ensure improved capacities for conducting activities such as assessing the status of arctic observing efforts, optimizing logistic operations, and for quickly accessing external and project-focused web resources for more detailed information and data.",

            "abstract": "Here we define the Tuff of Huntoon Creek (THC), previously identified and mapped in Mono Basin, CA by Gilbert et al. (1968) as “latite ignimbrite” (K-Ar date of 11.1-11.9 Ma). Formally defining this formation and its paleomagnetic characteristics, can help reveal the spatial and temporal relationships of the Walker Lane and Mina Deflection structural features, including distribution of vertical axis rotation. THC is composed of four tuffs with an intercalated volcaniclastic sandstone giving a total stratigraphic thickness of ~300 m. We define THC in a gorge of Huntoon Creek, where the stratigraphic section is capped by Pliocene basalt. The lowest and most extensive stratigraphic unit, the Huntoon Valley member of THC, is ~243 m thick and can be distinguished from other units by the presence of sanidine and biotite phenocrysts and normal polarity. A 7-meter-thick volcaniclastic sandstone overlies the Huntoon Valley member, straddling a magnetic polarity reversal within the section. The 3 overlying members of THC are reversed-polarity, biotite-bearing, sanidine-free tuffs of variable degrees of welding. Their paleomagnetic directions are each statistically distinguishable from the others, indicating that the deposition of each tuff is separated by a significant amount of time and can be used as a geologically instantaneous measure of Earth’s magnetic field for purposes of averaging out secular variation. The capping Pliocene olivine basalt was emplaced over an erosional unconformity of significant relief, as evidenced by the complete absence at some locations of the uppermost biotite-bearing THC member. The tilt corrected mean paleomagnetic direction for the 4 members of THC indicate a clockwise rotation magnitude of 77.5°±40.3°. The absolute rotation results of this locality are statistically indistinguishable from the relative rotation results of this locality compared to Cowtrack Mountain (Lindeman et al. 2013). The corroboration of these data suggests that this region of the Mina Deflection has undergone large magnitude clockwise rotation since the emplacement of THC. However, the capping basalt exhibits a magnetic declination of due north, suggesting that this unit experienced little rotation and that rotational deformation in this region had mostly ended by the time of its emplacement at ~3.5 Ma.",

Most notably, pH of the coral calcifying fluid has been shown to be significantly elevated relative to seawater. Such pH regulation not only determines coral calcification responses to environmental changes (e.g. ocean acidification and rising temperature), but also affects the elemental and isotopic compositions of coral skeleton and complicates the interpretation of various geochemical proxies. Based on existing models of coral calcification and geochemical constraints on its pH regulation, I simulated the chemistry, especially pH, of the coral calcifying fluid, and evaluated the calcification responses to changing seawater chemistry among different coral species. Predictions from these simulations compare favorably with results from laboratory manipulation experiments, and suggest different coral species can exhibit different responses to ocean acidification depending on their respective capabilities to regulate the calcifying environment. The implication of these model results for interpreting geochemical proxies will also be discussed at the meeting.",

            "abstract": "The Saskatchewan River Basin (SaskRB) in Saskatchewan, Canada, supports various water demands including municipal, industrial, irrigated agriculture, hydropower and environmental sectors. Proposals for future development include significantly increased irrigation. However, proposing an appropriate level of irrigation development requires incorporation of water supply uncertainties in the water resources management analysis, including effects of climate variability and change. To evaluate potential climate change effects, a feasible range of shifts in annual volume and peak timing of headwater flows are considered to stochastically generate flows at the Alberta/Saskatchewan border. This envelope of flows, 30,800 realizations, is further combined with various irrigation expansion areas to form various future scenarios. Using an integrated water resources model developed for Saskatchewan, the impact of irrigation development on the system is assessed under the changing water supply conditions. The results of this study show that level of irrigation development as well as variation in volume and peak timing of flows can all contribute to change the water availability, vulnerability and economic productivity of the water resources system in Saskatchewan. In particular, the combined effect of large irrigation expansion, reduction in the volume of flows and earlier timing of the annual peak can exacerbate water resources system vulnerability, produce unstable net revenues, and decrease flood frequency in the Saskatchewan River Delta.",

In the figure we show the displacement patterns for the (a) (3,2,1) mode in the two layer core, (b) (3,2,1) mode in the inner core, (c) (3,2,1) mode in the outer core, and (d) the (2,1,1) mode, known as the tilt over mode, in the two layer core. We also study the inertial modes of a core model which includes an elastic solid inner core in order to investigate the effects of elastic boundary at the inner boundary interface on the frequencies and the displacement eigenfunctions of these modes. The novelty of the approach is in the manner the boundary conditions are applied, especially at the interface, for a Galerkin formulation of the governing equations.",

            "abstract": "The Lau and North Fiji backarc basins are located in a tectonically complex region of the South Pacific, where the upper mantle may have been modified by up to five hotspots (Samoa, Rurutu, Rarotonga, Macdonald, and Louisville), each with distinct geochemical fingerprints. We present new Hf, Nd, Sr, and Pb isotopic data for basaltic samples dredged from seven areas along an east-west transect spanning the Lau and North Fiji basins to determine the possible influence and distribution of these various hotspot sources. We find that the isotope ratios of nearly all samples can be explained by mixing a depleted mantle component, which is ubiquitous in the Lau Basin, with a component similar to that found in Samoan shield (EMII) and/or rejuvenated (EMI) lavas. Lavas as far southwest as the Fiji Triple Junction (North Fiji Basin) show enriched geochemical signatures (87Sr/86Sr and 206Pb/204Pb up to 0.7037 and 18.635 respectively, and 143Nd/144Nd and 176Hf/177Hf down to 0.51285 and 0.283023, respectively) trending toward Samoa. This observation extends the range of Samoan influence into the North Fiji Basin 400 km south of its previous observed extent at South Pandora Ridge. The few samples that cannot be explained solely by incorporation of Samoan material are from the northeastern Lau Basin (Falloon et al., 2007) and host a dilute HIMU component that may relate to the incorporation of material from the Rurutu hotspot. This component is not observed further to the west in the Lau and North Fiji basins. A ubiquitous EMI signature in the region may be linked to the Rarotonga hotspot. New dredges from the northeast Lau Basin may give clearer signals that will reveal the identity of the enriched plume component.",

Each template is assembled from 100's to 1000's of individual LFEs, representing a total of over 200,000 independent detections spanning a selection of episodic-tremor-and-slip (ETS) events between 2003 and 2013. On the basis of empirical evidence and analytical arguments, these templates can be considered as band-limited, empirical Green's functions excited from shallow-thrust point sources to station locations corresponding to a collection of temporary and permanent network sites. The high fidelity of template match-filtered detections enables precise alignment of individual LFE time series and analysis of LFE amplitudes. Upon correction for geometrical spreading, attenuation, free-surface magnification and radiation pattern, we solve for station-channel amplification factors and LFE magnitudes for all detections corresponding to a given ETS episode. We will present a spatio-temporal analysis of LFE magnitudes including their variability across different ETS events, their dependence in along-dip location, and their expression in different rupture modes, i.e. main front versus rapid tremor reversals of Houston [2011] versus small scale reversals of Rubin and Armbruster [2013].",

            "abstract": "Future climate changes may have significant effects on many North American ecosystems. One way of assessing the potential impacts of future climate change is to use future climate analogues of present climate to evaluate the spatial extent and rates of future climate change. We used a set of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) future climate simulations (2006-2100) produced under representative concentration pathway scenario RCP8.5. We regridded these data to a 10-km equal-area grid of North America. Modern climate data (1961-1990 30-year mean) were interpolated to the same 10-km grid. The projected future climate data were analyzed using 10-year mean values of monthly and seasonal temperature and precipitation and a set of derived annual bioclimatic variables (e.g., growing degree days) considered to be ecologically significant.\nPotential future climate analogues were calculated for each grid cell using Euclidean distances to identify similar climates occurring elsewhere in North America. We identify regions that are projected to retain climates similar to present in the future (e.g., parts of the southeastern United States) and regions where present climates are projected to become less common or to disappear in the future (e.g., high elevation sites in western North America). We also calculate the rates of change in locations of similar climates (i.e., climate analogue velocities) and compare our results with simulated paleoclimate velocities over the past 22 kyr (from TraCE-21ka transient climate simulations for 22 ka-present). We discuss the implications of these results for conservation and natural resource management in North America. We also describe a web application being developed to allow researchers, decision makers, and members of the public, to visualize, explore, and use the climate analogue data.",

Additionally, the compositions of these newly found planets will not be identical to either Neptune or Uranus. Therefore, rather than compute the EOS for each possible planetary interior, it behooves us to understand the general behavior of mixtures relevant to these interiors. We present the results of varying the concentration ratios in a mixture of Methane, Ammonia, and Water at a density of 3.0g/cc using quantum molecular dynamics simulations. We show the onset of a superionic phase of the mixtures occurs for all mixing ratios below a temperature of 4,000K.

            "abstract": "Topography plays a commanding role on the organization of ecohydrologic processes and resulting vegetation patterns. In southwestern United States, climate conditions lead to terrain aspect- and elevation-controlled ecosystems, with mesic north-facing and xeric south-facing vegetation types; and changes in biodiversity as a function of elevation from shrublands in low desert elevations, to mixed grass/shrublands in mid elevations, and forests at high elevations and ridge tops. These observed patterns have been attributed to differences in topography-mediated local soil moisture availability, micro-climatology, and life history processes of plants that control chances of plant establishment and survival. While ecohydrologic models represent local vegetation dynamics in sufficient detail up to sub-hourly time scales, plant life history and competition for space and resources has not been adequately represented in models. In this study we develop an ecohydrologic cellular automata model within the Landlab component-based modeling framework. This model couples local vegetation dynamics (biomass production, death) and plant establishment and competition processes for resources and space. This model is used to study the vegetation organization in a semiarid New Mexico catchment where elevation and hillslope aspect play a defining role on plant types. Processes that lead to observed plant types across the landscape are examined by initializing the domain with randomly assigned plant types and systematically changing model parameters that couple plant response with soil moisture dynamics. Climate perturbation experiments are conducted to examine the plant response in space and time. Understanding the inherently transient ecohydrologic systems is critical to improve predictions of climate change impacts on ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Key to understanding the threat posed by large megathrust earthquakes is identifying where the potential for these destructive events exists. Studying extended sequences of earthquakes, Slip Deficit and Stress Evolution modelling techniques may hold the key to locating areas of concern. However, as well as using recent instrumentally constrained slip distributions they require the production of high resolution source models for pre-instrumental events.\nOne place we can attempt this longer term modelling is along the Sunda Trench with its record of large megathrust earthquakes dating back centuries. Coral microatolls populating the intertidal areas of the Sumatran Forearc act as long-term geodetic recorders of tectonic activity. Repeated cycles of stress accumulation and release alter relative sea levels around these islands. Growth of corals, controlled by the level of the lowest tide, exploit interseismic rises in sea level. In turn, they experience die-offs when coseismic drops in sea level lead to subaerially exposure. Examination of coral stratigraphy reveals a history of displacements from which information of past earthquakes can be inferred.\nWe have developed a Genetic Algorithm Slip Estimator (GASE) to rapidly produce high resolution slip distributions from coral displacement data. GASE recombines information held in populations of randomly generated slip distributions, to create superior models, satisfying observed displacements. Non-unique solutions require multiple iterations of the algorithm, producing a suite of models from which an ensemble slip distribution is drawn. Systematic testing of the algorithm demonstrates its ability to reliably estimate both known synthetic and instrumentally constrained slip distributions based on surface displacements. We will present high-resolution source models satisfying published displacement data for a number recent and paleoearthquakes along the Sunda trench, including the great 1797 and 1833 events.",

            "abstract": "The oxygen isotope composition of carbonate minerals varies with temperature as well as other environmental variables. For carbonates that precipitate slowly, under conditions that approach thermodynamic equilibrium, the temperature-dependence of 18O uptake is the dominant signal and the measured 18O content can be used as a paleotemperature proxy. In the more common case where carbonate minerals grow in a regime where they are not in isotopic equilibrium with their host solution, their stable isotope compositions are a convolution of the effects of multiple environmental variables.\nWe present results from inorganic calcite growth experiments demonstrating the occurrence of non-equilibrium oxygen isotope effects that vary systematically with pH and crystal growth rate. We have developed an isotopic ion-by-ion crystal growth model that quantifies the competing roles of temperature, pH, and growth rate, and provides a general description of calcite-water oxygen isotope fractionation under non-equilibrium conditions. The model predicts that (1) there are both equilibrium and kinetic contributions to calcite oxygen isotopes at biogenic growth rates, (2) calcite does not inherit the stable isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), (3) for oxygen isotopes there is a kinetically controlled variation of about 1‰ per pH unit between pH=7.7 and 9.3 at constant growth rate for inorganic calcite as well as the foraminifera Orbulina universa, and (4) extreme light isotope enrichments in calcite in alkaline environments are likely due to disequilibrium among DIC species in aqueous solution.\nThe experimental and modeling approaches can be extended to carbon isotope as well as clumped isotope uptake into calcite but additional data are needed to constrain the kinetic fractionation factors for carbon isotopes and doubly-substituted isotopologues. The results will be discussed in the context of separating the relative influence of inorganic and biologic processes on isotopic fractionation.",

            "abstract": "History shows that substantial investments in protection against any specific type of natural disaster usually occur only after (usually shortly after) that specific type of disaster has happened in a given place. This is true even when it was well known before the event that there was a significant risk that it could occur. Presumably what psychologists Kahneman and Tversky have called “availability bias” is responsible, at least in part, for these failures to act on known but out-of-sample risks. While understandable, this human tendency prepares us poorly for events which are very rare (on the time scales of human lives) and even more poorly for a changing climate, as historical records become a poorer guide.\nA more forward-thinking and rational approach would require scientific risk assessments that can place meaningful probabilities on events that are rare enough to be absent from the historical record, and that can account for the influences of both anthropogenic climate change and low-frequency natural climate variability. The set of tools available for doing such risk assessments is still quite limited, particularly for some of the most extreme events such as tropical cyclones and tornadoes. We will briefly assess the state of the art for these events in particular, and describe some of our ongoing research to develop new tools for quantitative risk assessment using hybrids of statistical methods and physical understanding of the hazards.",

            "abstract": "Based on Atmospheric Infrared Sunder (AIRS) Obs4MIPs data, Tian et al. (2013) evaluated the climatological mean tropospheric air temperature and specific humidity simulations in Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) models. They found that most CMIP5 models have a cold bias in the extratropical upper troposphere and a double-Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) bias in the whole troposphere over the tropical Pacific. They also pointed out the cloud-related sampling biases in the AIRS Obs4MIPs air temperature and specific humidity climatologies that were later quantified by Hearty et al. (2014). In this study, we will continue comparing the tropospheric specific humidity climatologies between the CMIP5 model simulations and the AIRS Obs4MIPs data after correcting the AIRS data sampling biases to quantify the overall tropospheric moist or dry bias of CMIP5 models. In particular, we will quantify the strength of the double-ITCZ bias in each individual CMIP5 model and discuss its possible implication for climate sensitivity and climate prediction.",

            "abstract": "In this project a multi-disciplinary undergraduate team from CUA, comprising majors in Physics, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Biology, design, build, test, fly, and analyze the data from a prototype attitude determination system (PADS). The goal of the experiment is to determine if an inexpensive attitude determination system could be built for high altitude research balloons using MEMS gyros. PADS is a NASA funded project, built by students with the cooperation of CUA faculty, Verner, Bruhweiler, and Abot, along with the contributed expertise of researchers and engineers at NASA/GSFC, Kogut, Lowe, Mirel, and Lazear. The project was initiated through a course taught in CUA’s School of Engineering, which was followed by a devoted effort by students during the summer of 2014. The project is an experiment to use 18 MEMS gyros, similar to those used in many smartphones, to produce an averaged positional error signal that could be compared with the motion of the fixed optical system as recorded through a string of optical images of stellar fields to be stored on a hard drive flown with the experiment. The optical system, camera microprocessor, and hard drive are enclosed in a pressure vessel, which maintains approximately atmospheric pressure throughout the balloon flight. The experiment uses multiple microprocessors to control the camera exposures, record gyro data, and provide thermal control. CUA students also participated in NASA-led design reviews. Four students traveled to NASA’s Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility in Palestine, Texas to integrate PADS into a large balloon gondola containing other experiments, before being shipped, then launched in mid-August at Ft. Sumner, New Mexico. The payload is to fly at a float altitude of 40-45,000 m, and the flight last approximately 15 hours. The payload is to return to earth by parachute and the retrieved data are to be analyzed by CUA undergraduates. A description of the instrument is presented here as well as a preliminary analysis of the anticipated data, which were not available at the time of abstract submission.\nAcknowledgements: NASA grant NNX13AR61 under NASA’s Undergraduate Student Instrument Program (USIP).

The Discover-AQ/FRAPPE field experiment took place along the Colorado Front Range in July and August, 2014. The air quality modeling team of the NOAA Air Resources Laboratory was one of the three teams that provided real-time air quality forecasting for the campaign. The U.S. EPA Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) Model was used with emission inventories based on the data set used by the NOAA National Air Quality Forecasting Capacity (NAQFC). By analyzing the forecast results calculated using aircraft measurements, it was found that CO emissions tended to be overestimated, while ethane emissions were underestimated. Biogenic VOCs were also underpredicted. Due to their relatively high altitude, ozone concentrations in Denver and the surrounding areas are affected by both local emissions and transported ozone. The modeled ozone was highly dependent on the meteorological predictions over this region. The complex terrain over the Rocky Mountains also contributed to the model uncertainty. This study discussed the causes of model biases, the forecast performance under different meteorology, and results from using different model grid resolutions. Several data assimilation techniques were further tested to improve the “post-analysis” performance of the modeling system for the period.",

            "abstract": "Meltwater Pulse 1a (MWP1a; 14,600 years ago), is the largest rapid sea level rise event observed in geological records (~15 m in < 350 years). Its relative synchronicity with the unexplained and abrupt Northern Hemisphere Bolling warming (Deschamps et al., 2012) makes it a particularly interesting event. In order to understand the link between ice sheets, sea level and climate changes during that time, we must first determine the sources and causes of the sea level change. A recent study by Gregoire et al. (2012) modelled the evolution of North American and Greenland ice cover over the last deglaciation and suggested that the collapse of an ice saddle between the Laurentide and Cordilleran Ice Sheets could have been a major contributor to the meltwater pulse. However, the relative contributions of the Antarctic, North American and Eurasian ice sheets to MWP1a remain unconstrained.\nWe combined analysis of ice sheet modelling uncertainty with sea level fingerprinting to constrain the contribution of the North American ice sheet to MWP1a.\nTo explore uncertainties in climate and ice sheet processes, we performed ensembles of ice sheet model simulations with Glimmer-CISM, forced by transient deglacial experiments from two General Circulation Models (FAMOUS and CCSM3). The results were then compared with geological reconstructions of ice extent and sea level change to evaluate a probability distribution for the Northern American ice sheet contribution to MWP1a.\nWe also predicted the gravitationally self-consistent sea-level changes associated with the ice model simulations to explore whether the Laurentide-Cordilleran saddle collapse could have been the dominant source of MWP1a on the basis of fits to far-field sea-level records at Barbados, Tahiti and Sunda Shelf.\nBased on these interdisciplinary and multi-model results, we present a new scenario for the relative contributions of the different ice sheets to MWP1a.",

            "abstract": "Changes in extreme temperatures, heat waves, heavy rainfall events, and precipitation frequency can have adverse impacts on human health, air quality, agricultural productivity, and water resources. Using the aerosol only (AER) and greenhouse gas only (GHG) “single forcing” simulations (3 ensemble members each) from the GFDL CM3 chemistry-climate model, we investigate aerosol- versus greenhouse gas-induced changes in high temperature and precipitation extremes over the United States. We identify changes in these events from 1860 to 2005 and the associated large-scale dynamical conditions. Small changes in these extremes in the “all forcing” simulations reflect cancellations between the individual, opposite-signed effects of increasing anthropogenic aerosols and greenhouse gases. In AER, aerosols lead to lower extreme high temperatures and fewer warm spells over the western US (-2.1 K regional average; -20 days/year) and over the central and northeast US (-1.5 K; -12 days/year). In GHG, a similar but opposite-signed response pattern occurs (+2.7 K and +14 days/year over the western US; +2.5 K and +10 days/year in the central and northeast US). The similar spatial response patterns in AER versus GHG suggest a preferred regional mode of response that is largely independent of the regional distribution of the forcing agent. The influence of both greenhouse gases and aerosols on extreme high temperature is weakest in the southeast US, collocated with the observed “warming hole”. No statistically significant change occurs in AER, and a warming of only +1.8 K occurs in GHG. Warming in this region continues to be muted over the 21st century under the RCP 8.5 scenario, with increases in extreme temperatures more than 1 K smaller than elsewhere. Aerosols induce decreases in the number of days per year with at least 10mm of precipitation (R10mm) over the eastern US in summer and winter and over the southern US in spring of roughly 1 day/year. In contrast, greenhouse gases induce increases in R10mm over the eastern US in winter (+0.8 days/year), the northern and central US during spring (+1 day/year), and the southeast US during summer (+0.5 days/year), but decreases over the northeast US in summer (-0.2 days/year). In RCP 8.5, the patterns of extreme temperature and precipitation associated with greenhouse gas forcing dominate.",

Previous studies on hydraulic property upscaling focusing on steady state flux exchanges illustrated that an effective hydraulic property is usually more difficult to define for evaporation. This study focuses on upscaling hydraulic properties of large scale transient evaporation dynamics using the idea of the stream tube approach. Specifically, the two main objectives are: (1) if the three simple averaging schemes (i.e., arithmetic, geometric and harmonic means) of hydraulic parameters are appropriate in representing large scale evaporation processes, and (2) how the applicability of these simple averaging schemes depends on the time scale of evaporation processes in heterogeneous soils. Multiple realizations of local evaporation processes are carried out using HYDRUS-1D computational code (Simunek et al, 1998). The three averaging schemes of soil hydraulic parameters were used to simulate the cumulative flux exchange, which is then compared with the large scale average cumulative flux. The sensitivity of the relative errors to the time frame of evaporation processes is also discussed.",

            "abstract": "Currently, many biogeochemical models lack the mechanistic capacity to accurately simulate soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics, especially within intensely managed landscapes (IMLs) such as those found in the U.S. Midwest. These modeling limitations originate by not accounting for downslope connectivity of flowpathways initiated and governed by landscape processes and hydrologic forcing, which induce dynamic updates to the soil active layer (generally top 20-30cm of soil) with various sediment size fractions and aggregates being transported and deposited along the downslope. These hydro-geomorphic processes, often amplified in IMLs by tillage events and seasonal canopy, can greatly impact biogeochemical cycles (e.g., enhanced mineralization during aggregate breakdown) and in turn, have huge implications/uncertainty when determining SOC budgets. In this study, some of these limitations were addressed through a new concept, Potential Carbon Transport (PCT), a term which quantifies a maximum amount of material available for transport at various positions of the landscape, which was used to further refine a coupled modeling framework focused on SOC redistribution through downslope/lateral connectivity. Specifically, the size fractions slaked from large and small aggregates during raindrop-induced aggregate stability tests were used in conjunction with rainfall-simulated sediment enrichment ratio (ER) experiments to quantify the PCT under various management practices, soil types and landscape positions. Field samples used in determining aggregate stability and the ER experiments were collected/performed within the historic Clear Creek Watershed, home of the IML Critical Zone Observatory, located in Southeastern Iowa.",

            "abstract": "Since the earthquake hit Haiti in 2010, hydroclimatology measurements have been performed in southwestern Haiti. This area is coated with small mountainous rivers (SMRs) and has been susceptible to significant deforestation. Both anthropogenic activities and natural forces have altered the abundances and transformations of carbon as it is transported from land to the coastal ocean. This investigation of carbon transport and air-sea gas exchange in Haiti will address the current deficiency of scientific knowledge regarding biogeochemical cycles and tropical SMR systems. Vertical and horizontal flux of dissolved inorganic carbon is calculated primarily using carbon system data, including pCO2 and DIC, and salinity discharge curves. SF6, an inert gas, was mixed into a solution of salt and rhodamine to find air-sea gas exchange of these SMRs. Integration of both vertical and horizontal fluxes over a year aids in the identification of the movement of inorganic carbon be it weathering, respiration, or photosynthesis. Research will be continued throughout the season, but only dry season data is represented here so discharge values are expected to increase. As rivers fork and bifurcate, it is difficult to address all branches of southwestern Haiti’s rivers. Thus, concentration lies on both the largest rivers and those most prudent to current hydroelectric power prospects.",

            "abstract": "Deep long period (DPL) seismic swarms recently detected beneath Mauna Loa fuel speculation whether the volcano could enter a renewed phase of unrest. To mitigate threats from future eruptions, a better understanding of how and over which timescales magma moves within Mauna Loa is required. We present a novel approach linking the compositions preserved in the chemical stratigraphy of 158 olivine crystals with kinetic modelling to provide timescales and routes of magma migration beneath Mauna Loa prior to the voluminous (376 million m3, [1]) 1950 eruption of Mauna Loa. We have studied a total of 8 near-vent samples erupted from fissures that opened progressively at elevations from 12,000ft to 8,500ft within the first 24h of the eruption (June 1-23, 1950). The samples contain olivine crystals with different populations of core (Fo89, Fo87-88, Fo85-86, Fo82-84), and rim compositions (majority Fo78-81) and zoning patterns (normal, reverse and complex). The diverging compositional and zoning record can be best explained as the product of magma evolution in five distinct magmatic environments (MEs): M0 (=Fo89), M1 (=Fo87-88), M2 (=Fo85-86), M3 (=Fo82-84), M4 (=Fo78-81) with melt transfer and mixing among them. Modelling the diffusive relaxation of the compositional zoning profiles constrains the timescales and durations over which crystals (and melt) are transferred between the different MEs. Diffusion models were performed at temperatures of 1133-1168°C and fO2 at ∆NNO -0.55 [2]. The derived timescales range from ~20 days up to 11 months, with the majority of the timescales being shorter than 4 months. The nature and duration of magma transfer beneath Mauna Loa prior to the catastrophic 1950 eruption is interpreted as follows: (i) Three dominant magma migration pathways connecting the environments M1:M4, M3:M4 and M2:M4 can be identified; and (ii) transfer of magma along these routes occurs in multiples pulses commencing up to 8 months before, and becoming more frequent in the weeks prior to, eruption. Depth constraints for each these environments remain to be resolved but are likely to extend from beneath the MOHO to within the shallow edifice [3].\n[1] Finch & Macdonald (1950) USGS Bul 996-B, 27-89; [2] Gerlach (1993) Geochim Cosmochim Acta 57, 795-814; [3] Thornber & Trusdell (2008), IAVCEI General Assembly 2008, Reykjavik",

These weather generators are used for developing time-series data for extended periods assuming that the conditions are stationary. Single-site generators preserve the mean and variance. However, some recently developed multi-site weather generators also claim to preserve spatial correlation in addition to the mean and variance of selected variables. Markov Chain based approaches are used in both types of generators used in this study to preserve wet/dry statistics.\nThe main objective of this study is to evaluate several single- and multi-site weather generators that are used for the generation of the long-term precipitation at the Mekong River Basin (MRB), one of the largest river basins (~840,000 km2) in the world. The MRB covers a wide array of hydro-climatic conditions, terrain and land-cover types. Thus, it provides a very challenging backdrop to test these weather generators. Daily precipitation of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 (v7) at 0.25-degree resolution from 1998 to 2012 is used in this study as the observed data set.",

            "abstract": "Civilization and in particular agriculture worldwide depends on the availability of clean freshwater resources stored in the underlying soil and aquifer systems. Unfortunately, water quality is often deteriorating, which is e.g. due to the extensive use of fertilizers or pesticides in agriculture or infiltrating waste water from cities and industries. All groundwater bodies commonly discharge into the nearby surface-water bodies like streams, lakes, or springs, and soil water is a direct water source for the biosphere. Therefore, bio-hydro-geochemical reaction systems along flow paths of the unsaturated as well as the saturated zone can have a strong impact on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.\nThe simulation of such reactive transport problems in different hydrological compartments can help to understanding the comprehensive processes chain. One way to evaluate the water quality in space and time is to model the mass transport in soil and/or groundwater together with the contemporaneous chemical reactions numerically. Such physical and bio- hydro- geochemical driven forward simulations are usually solved by standard finite differences, finite element or finite volume methods, but simulating these scenarios at catchment scales is a challenging task due to the extreme computational load, numerical stability issues and different scale-dependencies.\nThe main focus of the present study is the numerical simulation of reactive transport processes in heterogeneous porous media at large scales, i.e. from field scale, over hill slopes towards catchment scale. The objective of the study is, to develop a robust modelling framework which allows to identify appropriate levels of heterogeneity as well as the possibly dominating structural features (e.g. S-shaped clay lenses) with respect to specific reaction systems. The presented modelling framework will describe the functional interaction of different numerical methods and high performing computing (HPC) techniques by the use of exemplary case studies. The concept includes different numerical coupling concepts e.g. operator splitting, global implicit approaches, particle tracking method, or tool couplings together with an OpenMPI parallelization scheme for reactive transport simulations on HPC-Cluster infrastructures.",

            "abstract": "High-energy emission from lightning is more easily measured at high altitudes, close to or within the electric fields accelerating the energetic particles. Gamma rays from long duration glows and x-rays from stepped leaders attenuate with distance. From mountaintops, it may be possible to measure an amplified version of the x-rays commonly seen from stepped leaders. These amplified x-rays could arise from the thunderstorm electric field multiplying the energetic particles via Relativistic Runaway Electron Avalanches (RREA). Amplified stepped leaders may be similar or even the same as terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs), which need long-range electric fields to produce the intensities seen from space. We deployed two gamma-ray detectors at the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory site on the northeastern slope of the Sierra Negra near Puebla, Mexico at 4100 meters to search for amplified leader events and also for the minutes-long gamma-ray glows observed from thunderstorms by other groups from the ground, balloons, and aircraft. We will also examine the data from HAWC itself, a large array of water tanks viewed by photomultiplier tubes, to look for signals simultaneous with any in our scintillators. In principle, large Cherenkov detectors and small scintillators can give complementary data about the radiation field, emphasizing the total energy content and the number flux of particles, respectively. We will present results from the summer 2014 deployment and talk about future lightning gamma-ray detectors to be deployed at HAWC.",

            "abstract": "Increased rainfall/evaporation ratio had merged the Dead Sea and Sea of Galilee basins to a 260 km long Lake Lisan during the Last Glacial Maximum, 160 m below current mean sea level (mbsl). The timing of the natural drop to the 400 mbsl (Dead Sea level) has been precisely determined to 25-11 ka. Human settlements had initiated near the retreating shorelines at 21 ka. However, rather than following the dropping level, the subsequent settlement took advantage of swamps perched above 240 mbsl.\nAlong with an increased number of persons in the communities that left artefacts in the lacustrine and shore sediments, the technologies for exploiting the environment for survival had evolved. Some of the finds attest to activities that were not tied immediately to physical survival. The development of art and of social behaviour raises fascinating issues regarding our perception of the capabilities and motives of Mankind during the change from hunter-gatherer subsistence to one based on cultivation of plants and livestock associated with settlement.\nThe changes in the lifestyle are likely related to the environmental changes, some of which can be reconstructed by modern geological tools. On the other hand, some of the findings of the archaeological studies can help resolve geological issues, such as aridization around 9 ka, attested by initiation of gully washers that form boulder deposits over Netiv Hagdud site. The aridization is hindered relatively to lake level drop, presumably due to evolving spatial distribution of rainfall, where the rift shoulders still receive rain, while lake decline reflects aridization in the southern drainage, namely the Negev. This observation accords with speleothem studies from the rift shoulders.",

            "abstract": "High temperature (~300°C) hydrothermal alteration of peridotites can produce an alteration assemblage abundant in Fe-bearing serpentine and magnetite without the presence of brucite. This is particularly so in systems with SiO2-rich fluids derived from the hydration of orthopyroxene in basaltic intrusions and gabbros [1]. Few experimental studies have investigated the effects of aSiO2(aq) on the rate of olivine serpentinization and none that have examined the Fe isotopic composition of olivine hydrolysis products. Thus, this study addresses these problems by using flexible gold cell hydrothermal equipment to react olivine (Fo90) and talc with a NaCl-bearing fluid at 300 °C and 500 bars for ~90 days; providing time-series solution chemistry data coupled with Fe isotope, magnetic susceptibility, and Mössbauer measurements of reactant olivine and the serpentinization product. Talc is used to elevate the aSiO2(aq)above the serpentine-brucite buffer, effectively preventing brucite formation and allowing only the formation of Fe-bearing serpentine and magnetite from olivine alteration.\nInitial time series solution chemistry data indicate that the net rate of the serpentinization of olivine and talc dissolution is such that the experimental system is poised between the serpentine-brucite and serpentine-talc stability fields, with little H2 generated by the oxidation of Fe2+ upon formation of Fe-serpentine and magnetite. However, as the talc Si-source becomes effectively titrated, the continued hydration of olivine decreases the aSiO2(aq) towards the serpentine-brucite stability field concurrent with an increasing rate of H2 generation. This chemical transition likely reflects an enhanced rate of magnetite formation upon a decrease in the relative stability of Fe-serpentine. Fe isotope data indicate a slight enrichment trend in δ56Fe versus Fe3+/ΣFe of the altered mineral phases, magnetite > Fe-serpentine > olivine, although the observed inter-mineral fractionations are small, <0.1 ‰. These experimental data are consistent with observations of natural Fe isotope data derived from hydrothermally altered peridotites [2] while providing requisite quantitative constraints to understand better their origin and evolution.\n[1] Bach et al., 2006 (GRL)\n[2] Craddock et al., 2014 (EPSL)",

            "abstract": "We introduce a new framework for efficient posterior sampling in Bayesian inference, using a combination of optimal transport maps and the Metropolis-Hastings rule. The core idea is to use transport maps to transform typical Metropolis proposal mechanisms (e.g., random walks, Langevin methods, Hessian-preconditioned Langevin methods) into non-Gaussian proposal distributions that can more effectively explore the target density. Our approach adaptively constructs a lower triangular transport map—i.e., a Knothe-Rosenblatt re-arrangement—using information from previous MCMC states, via the solution of an optimization problem. Crucially, this optimization problem is convex regardless of the form of the target distribution. It is solved efficiently using Newton or quasi-Newton methods, but the formulation is such that these methods require no derivative information from the target probability distribution; the target distribution is instead represented via samples. Sequential updates using the alternating direction method of multipliers enable efficient and parallelizable adaptation of the map even for large numbers of samples. We show that this approach uses inexact or truncated maps to produce an adaptive MCMC algorithm that is ergodic for the exact target distribution. Numerical demonstrations on a range of parameter inference problems involving both ordinary and partial differential equations show multiple order-of-magnitude speedups over standard MCMC techniques, measured by the number of effectively independent samples produced per model evaluation and per unit of wallclock time.",

The framework uses the ALEXI (Atmosphere Land Exchange Inverse)/DisALEXI (Disaggregated ALEXI) suite of land-surface models forced by remotely sensed data from Landsat, MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), and GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite). Land-surface temperature (LST) can be an effective substitute for in-situ surface moisture observations and a valuable metric for constraining land-surface fluxes at sub-field scales. The adopted multi-scale thermal-based land surface modeling framework facilitates regional to local downscaling of water and energy fluxes by using a combination of shortwave reflective and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery from GOES (4-10 km; hourly), MODIS (1 km; daily), and Landsat (30-100 m; bi-weekly). In this research the ALEXI/DisALEXI modeling suite is modified to incorporate carbon fluxes using a stomatal resistance module, which replaces the Priestley-Taylor latent heat approximation. In the module, canopy level nominal light-use-efficiency (βn) is the parameter that modulates the flux of water and carbon in and out of the canopy. Leaf chlorophyll (Chl) is a key parameter for quantifying variability in photosynthetic efficiency to facilitate the spatial distribution of coupled carbon and water retrievals. Spatial distribution of Chl are retrieved from Landsat (30 m) using a surface reflectance dataset as input to the REGularized canopy reFLECtance (REGFLEC) tool. The modified ALEXI/DisALEXI suite is applied to regions of rain fed and irrigated soybean and maize agricultural landscapes within the continental U.S. and flux estimates are compared with flux tower observations.",

Isotopic data from synoptic surveys in three different years in the Langtang Valley, Nepal show seasonal shifts in oxygen-18 isotope values (reported as δ18O) for glacier discharge, liquid precipitation, and surface water samples. From samples collected in November-December 2008, May 2012, and October-November 2013 we present results of isotope values at seventeen sites resampled on multiple occasions over this time period, as well as the elevational lapse rate in monsoon precipitation during the 2012 and 2013 seasons.\n Samples of discharge at the outlet of the debris-covered Lirung Glacier have δ18O isotope values that range from -9.29‰ in May 2012 to -18.43‰ in November 2013. Samples from discharge of the clean-ice Khimsung Glacier, in the same sub-catchment, have δ18O values that only range from -13.63‰ in May 2012 to -16.39‰ in November 2013. Depth-integrated snow from a pit at 5184 m in May 2012 has a mean δ18O value of -8.09‰ while a fresh snow sample from 5100 m in November 2013 has a value of -27.22‰. Samples from a hotspring 20 km do not vary as much, with δ18O values of -13.3‰ in November 2008 and -13.64‰ in May 2012. Monsoon precipitation collected as bulk samples between June and September 2012 in the Langtang Valley have a decrease in δ18O from -9.70‰ at 1400 m to -14.88‰ at 4350 m. These values are used in an attempt to unmix Langtang River water samples with δ18O values ranging from -14.8‰ to -11.83‰ in May 2012 and from -16.78‰ to -13.11‰ in November 2013.\nThe overlap in river water isotope samples between seasons, the seasonal shift in some source water isotope values, and the isotopic lapse rate in precipitation all present challenges for defining the chemistry of sources that contribute to river discharge and parameterizing mixing models. The variability in mixing model results based on seasonal changes in chemistry values is explored here and the plausibility of different versions is assessed.",

Here we show that the maximum earthquakes on different sections of the North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ) scale with the duration of fault zone activity, cumulative offset and length of individual fault segments. The findings are based on a compiled catalogue of historical earthquakes in the region, using the extensive literary sources that exist due to the long civilization record. We find that the largest earthquakes (M~8) are exclusively observed along the well-developed part of the fault zone in the east. In contrast, the western part is still in a juvenile or transitional stage with historical earthquakes not exceeding M=7.4. This limits the current seismic hazard to NW Turkey and its largest regional population and economical center Istanbul. Our findings for the NAFZ are consistent with data from the two other major transform faults, the San Andreas fault in California and the Dead Sea Transform in the Middle East. The results indicate that maximum earthquake magnitudes generally scale with fault-zone evolution.",

The warming is influencing sea ice thickness, while a more intense transpolar drift in the summer promotes faster removal of ice from the Siberian and Alaskan coasts towards Fram Strait. We are analyzing factors potentially responsible for the recent changes in the large-scale circulation, focusing specifically on the pronounced transpolar drift pattern in late summer. Experiments with an atmospheric GCM forced with prescribed SST anomalies typical for recent decades show that both warming in the North Atlantic (positive AMO) and PDO switching towards the negative phase might be contributing to those circulation changes.

            "abstract": "In recent years scientists have been debating the role of climate on the trajectory of Maya culture in the Late Classic period, 600-900 AD. Paleo-climatologists have reconstructed realizations of climate [Haug 2003; Medina-Elizalde 2012; Hodell 1995] that offer evidence for reduced precipitation in the Late Classic period. Recently French et al [2014] proposed that landuse change may also play an important role in the available water supply at Tikal, with the removal of tropical forest and conversion to maize-agriculture and urban landuse leading to extensive development of sophisticated water storage systems and rainfall harvesting for water supply and irrigation. Rapid population growth is a concurrent and compounding factor [Scarborough 2012; Shaw 2003] where landuse impacts the distribution and availability of water storage in the surrounding watershed. Although proposed climate scenarios for the Late Classic offer a quantitative scenario for possible atmospheric conditions at Tikal, the impact of land use change on the distribution and availability of water supply has not been evaluated.\nIn this research we reconstruct the plausible vulnerability of the water supply at Tikal under the combined forces of climatic and land use change. The Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM) [Qu and Duffy 2007] is used to simulate the daily-to-seasonal space and time distribution of soil moisture, groundwater and surface water storage for the period 700-800 AD, the peak of Tikal’s population history. The analysis includes a quantitative assessment of the likely changes in available water storage as tropical forest is converted to maize agriculture and urban land. In particular we examine the important control that reduced canopy interception plays in the seasonal availability of water. Preliminary simulations suggest that removing tropical forest increases runoff and available water storage, which may serve to moderate seasonal and long-term drought conditions.",

            "abstract": "In 1983 Techno, Inc. collected five seismic reflection profiles in the region between Whitefish, Montana and the United States-Canada border. The poulter method was used to gather four of these profiles and one profile was collected using a vibroseis source. We are currently reprocessing these data in order to construct a regional geological interpretation. The profiles cover a key position in the hinterland of the Cordillera in the lee of the Lewis thrust salient where the east-northeast verging Lewis thrust fault system translated (horizontal displacement >100 km) and inverted a thick, strong slab of primarily Belt-Purcell rocks out of a deep Precambrian depositional basin onto a cratonic platform. In this event, Belt-Purcell rocks were thrust over complexly imbricated Phanerozoic strata in the foreland. Late Mesozoic compressional deformation was followed by Cenozoic extensional collapse of the over-thickened Cordillera and subsequent basin and range style deformation that produced an array of northwest trending grabens. Three of the seismic profiles cross the Rocky Mountain Trench; the Trench is a linear structure of regional dimension that is an expression of the extensional fragmentation of the Cordillera. Strong reflections, interpreted as sills encased within Lower Belt rocks (encountered in the Arco-Marathon 1 Paul Gibbs borehole), outline the complexly folded and faulted structure of the eastern limb of the Purcell anticlinorium. East of the Rocky Mountain Trench stratified reflections within Belt rocks clearly outline the Wigwam Thrust. Beneath the Whitefish Range, an apparent inflection in the strongly reflective basal Cambrian veneer marks the westerly increase in dip of the Rocky Mountain Basal Detachment. The dip contrast between the foreland and hinterland might be a manifestation of the tectonic loading of the Belt basin margin and the loading might have localized extension across the Rocky Mountain Trench.",

We pursued these goals through measurement of atmospheric organics ranging from very volatile (using in-situ GC-MS and proton transfer reaction time-of-flight MS, PTR-ToF-MS) to semi-volatile gas and particle phase compounds (using the Semi-Volatile Thermal desorption Aerosol Gas chromatograph, SV-TAG).\nMeasured concentrations and fluxes of VOCs at the top of the SEARCH tower were coordinated with concentration gradients and fluxes at the AABC flux tower site, and vertical profiles using the Long-EZ aircraft to provide equivalent observations across sites. These results are informed through measurements using the same instrument during the FIXIT controlled laboratory oxidation study at CalTech that investigated oxidation pathways of BVOC with varying levels of anthropogenic pollutants.\nMeasurements by SV-TAG of particle-phase and total gas-plus-particle-phase compounds at the SEARCH tower provide hourly quantification of semi-volatile compounds, including the oxidation products of measured VOCs. Derivatization of hydroxyl groups prior to GC analysis allows analysis of highly oxidized chemicals, including most known tracers. Methyl tetrols, an oxidation product of isoprene, had a significant day-time gas-phase component, and their abundance was strongly correlated with particle-phase sulfate, indicative of anthropogenic influence on the formation or partitioning processes. Similar observations of pinic acid (monterpene oxidation product) and many other BVOC oxidation products were made in both the gas and particle phases.\nThrough measurements of specific chemical tracers across a wide range of volatilities, we explore the chemical lifecycle of BVOCs to understand anthropogenic-biogenic interactions in aerosol formation.",

            "abstract": "A synthesis of observations from fast and magmatically-robust intermediate spreading ridges suggest that fine-scale tectonic segments, previously classified as 3rd order, correspond with principle magmatic segments along these ridges, each with their own magmatic plumbing system in the crust and shallow mantle. In this study, we use multi-beam sonar data available for fast and intermediate spreading ridges to determine the length distribution of these segments for comparison with the primary segmentation of the ridge axis found at slower spreading ridges. A study of intermediate, slow and ultraslow-spreading ridges using global satellite-derived bathymetry indicates a dominant segment length of 53 km [Briais and Rabinowicz, J. Geophys. Res. 2002]. However, satellite-derived bathymetry cannot be used to identify fine-scale tectonic segmentation of fast and magmatically-robust intermediate spreading ridges due to the subdued low-relief expression of ridge-axis discontinuities along these spreading rates. This study focuses on the well-mapped regions of the East Pacific Rise between 13.35°S and 18°N, and the Galapagos Spreading Center between 85° and 95.38° W. We reexamine tectonic segmentation of the ridge axis previously identified in the literature and modify the locations of ridge-axis discontinuities defining segment ends in regions where modern multi-beam bathymetric data coverage has improved relative to that available in early studies. Discontinuities of first, second, and third order are used to define tectonic segment lengths. Initial results show a mean segment length of 42 km (standard deviation of 27 km) and a median of 33 km, with 85 segments studied, similar to the segment length distributions observed at slower spreading ridges. To further evaluate the hypothesis of principle magmatic segments, we also examine the relationship between fine-scale tectonic segmentation and properties of the crustal magmatic system imaged in prior seismic studies of fast and intermediate spreading ridges.",

            "abstract": "Two speleothems from eastern North America grew throughout Marine Isotope Stages 10 and 11. High-resolution stable isotope δ18O and δ13C, and Sr records are constrained by 16 230Th age dates. MIS 11 (374 – 424 kyr BP) is of particular interest due to the similarity of orbitally-controlled insolation conditions from this time period and the modern. While few high-resolution continental paleoclimate records exist for this time period, marine records reveal that during this prominent interglacial, sea surface temperatures were relatively stable, in contrast to those which occurred during the subsequent glacial period (MIS 10).\nSpeleothems TNBS-8 and TNMOR2-01, from Tennessee’s Blue Springs Cave and Morrell Cave, respectively, grew between 338 – 420 kyr BP and overlap for ~50 kyr. Growth rates were generally higher during MIS 11 than 10, with a higher degree of variability. Stable isotope δ18O and δ13C records (TNMOR2-01) show an overall trend towards higher values throughout the MIS 11-10 transition, with well-defined periods of depletion and enrichment. Sr concentration measured through µ-XRF reveals similar behavior as the δ13C record and serves as a proxy for moisture availability. Overlapping Sr results for both speleothems share general trends and reveal distinct intervals of increased precipitation occur throughout the record, with most coinciding with summer insolation maxima. The transitions of MIS 11.2 to 11.1 and MIS 11 to 10 are well-constrained by abrupt increases in δ18O and δ13C values along with Sr concentrations.\nAn examination of continental proxy responses to similar orbital and climatic conditions as the modern allows for not only a greater understanding of how the climate changed during the MIS 10-11, but also allows for the examination of natural climate variability in light of the addition of anthropogenic climate forcing.",

            "abstract": "Satellite Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) has greatly expanded the number volcanoes that can be monitored for ground deformation – the number of known deforming volcanoes has increased almost five-fold since 1997 (to more than 213 volcanoes in 2014). However, from 1992-2014, there are still gaps in global volcano surveillance and only a fraction of the 1400 subaerial Holocene volcanoes have frequent observations in this time period. Starting in 2014, near global observations of volcano deformation should begin with the Sentinel satellites from the European Space Agency, ALOS-2 from the Japanese Space Agency, and eventually NISAR from the Indian Space Agency and NASA. With more frequent observations, more volcano deformation episodes are sure to be observed, but evaluating the significance of the observed deformation is not always straightforward -- how can we determine if deformation will lead to eruption? To answer this question, an international task force has been formed to create an inventory of volcano deformation events as part of the Global Volcano Model (http://globalvolcanomodel.org/gvm-task-forces/volcano-deformation-database/).\nWe present the first results from our global study focusing on volcanoes that have few or no previous studies. In some cases, there is a lack of SAR data (for example, volcanoes of the South Sandwich Islands). For others, observations either show an absence of deformation or possible deformation that requires more data to be verified. An example of a deforming volcano that has few past studies is Pagan, an island in the Marianas Arc comprised of 2 stratovolcanoes within calderas. Our new InSAR measurements from both the ALOS and Envisat satellites show deformation near the 1981 May VEI 4 lava flow eruption on North Pagan at 2-3 cm/year between 2004-2010. Another example of a newly observed volcano is Karthala volcano in the Comoros. InSAR observations between 2004-2010 span four eruptions, only one of which is accompanied by deformation.",

            "abstract": "Accurate observations of global reservoir storage are critical to understand the global availability of managed water resources. By taking measurements at a 250-m2 spatial resolution and minimum frequency of every 22-days, the NASA SWOT mission will greatly improve the coverage of global reservoir monitoring. With a given 2020 launch date and projected orbit lifetime of only three years, it is essential that the measurement uncertainty is known in advance to maximize the applicability of SWOT data in monitoring systems or models as it is being acquired. We use in-situ measurements of California reservoirs as a ‘truth’ dataset to be compared to simulated SWOT data. Estimates of both temporal and spatial uncertainty will be determined by analyzing how much information is lost when using synthetic records over gauged measurements to generate time series of monthly reservoir storage and by evaluating changes in observations after perturbing satellite flight paths within the range of expected swaths. Based on similar studies that investigated expected SWOT measurement errors for lakes, anticipated uncertainty in SWOT reservoir storage estimates vary from a low of 5% for large reservoirs (>1 km2) to 20% for small reservoirs (<0.01 km2) with negligible impacts due to variations in orbit. The feasibility of using SWOT estimates of storage in large-scale hydrologic models will then be assessed by using synthetic SWOT storage to calibrate RES-ADAPT, a newly developed climate adaptive reservoir model that was tested in California and designed to evaluate global reservoir management impacts on the climate system.",

            "abstract": "This presentation focuses on linking climate knowledge to the complicated decision process for hydropower dam licensing, and the affected parties involved in that process. The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issues of licenses for nonfederal hydroelectric operations, typically 30-50 year licenses, and longer infrastructure lifespan, a similar time frame as the anticipated risks of changing climate and hydrology. Resources managed by other federal and state agencies such as the NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service may be affected by new or re-licensed projects. The federal Integrated Licensing Process gives the opportunity for affected parties to recommend issues for consultative investigation and possible mitigation, such as impacts to downstream fisheries. New or re-licensed projects have the potential to “pre-adapt” by considering and incorporating risks of climate change into their planned operations as license terms and conditions. Hundreds of hydropower facilities will be up for relicensing in the coming years (over 100 in the western Sierra Nevada alone, and large-scale water projects such as the proposed Lake Powell Pipeline), as well as proposed new dams such as the Susitna project in Alaska. Therefore, there is a need for comprehensive guidance on delivering climate analysis to support understanding of risks of hydropower projects to other affected resources, and decisions on licensing. While each project will have a specific context, many of the questions will be similar.\nWe also will discuss best practices for the use of climate science in water project planning and management, and how creating the best and most appropriate science is also still a developing art. We will discuss the potential reliability of that science for consideration in long term planning, licensing, and mitigation planning for those projects. For science to be “actionable,” that science must be understood and accepted by the potential users. This process is a negotiation, with climate scientists needing to understand the concerns of users and respond, and users developing a better understanding of the state of climate science in order to make an informed choice. We will also discuss what is needed to streamline providing that analysis for the many re-licensing decisions expected in the upcoming years.",

Geophys. Res., 111, F02002, doi:10.1029/2005JF000365). We use cosmogenic noble gas paleothermometry on samples from summit flats in the Sierra Nevada to estimate temperatures during the last glacial period in this region and further constrain the climatological predictions of these models. Cosmogenic noble gas paleothermometry utilizes the open-system behavior of cosmogenic noble gases at surface temperatures in common minerals like quartz to quantify the thermal histories of rocks during exposure to cosmic ray particles at the Earth’s surface. We sampled boulders and bedrock tors atop summit flats inferred to be exposed throughout the last glacial period and measured cosmogenic 3He and 21Ne concentrations in quartz from these samples. We use cosmogenic 21Ne, which is quantitatively retained at Earth surface temperatures in quartz, to constrain exposure durations and erosion rates, and cosmogenic 3He, which exhibits open-system behavior in quartz, to quantify time-integrated temperatures during surface exposure. Data from samples collected at the summit of Mt. Langley in the southern Sierra Nevada indicate that 30–45% of the cosmogenic 3He produced in quartz has been retained at surface exposure temperatures; the rest has been diffusively lost. Preliminary models using these data and published diffusion kinetics indicate that the difference between modern and LGM summit temperatures may be significantly greater than the 5.6°C difference predicted by Kessler et al. (2006). We would expect significantly less 3He to be retained if average temperatures were 5.6°C lower at the LGM. Additional cosmogenic noble gas measurements on samples from this site and other sites in the Sierra Nevada and White Mountains as well as sample-specific diffusion kinetics will enable us to quantify this difference more precisely.",

These stations cover a large variety of depths in the same geographical area, allowing for interesting comparisons in similar meteorological conditions. Acoustic noise (velocity and pressure) spectra are studied in the range 0.01 to 10 Hz at various depths. It is known that nonlinear interacting surface waves are the main source of acoustic noise at frequencies around 0.2 Hz with a successful direct model of acoustic spectra from a numerical model of ocean waves (Ardhuin et al. JASA 2013). In that band the main source of error is likely the uncertainties on sediment properties. At frequencies above 0.4 Hz, that direct model of the acoustic noise spectrum is not very accurate probably due to a poor representation of surface wave processes, in particular wave breaking, and their influence on the directional wave spectrum or on the direct generation of noise. Previous study deep stations (~5000 m depth) at H20 or the ACO observatory (Dunnebier et al. 2012) exhibit a strong correlation between acoustic noise level and surface wind speed. Comparison of spectra with meteorological and oceanographic conditions (wind records, wave hindcasts) provide a better way to understand the origin of the noise. The main features are :\n- booms and busts (Farrell and Munk 2010).\n- better observed correlation of acoustic noise level with wave significant height rather than surface wind speed (see e.g. below)\n- effects of station depth.\n- saturation of the gravity part (Farrell and Munk 2012).\n- other results from the work in progress.",

The nucleophilic reaction with sulfide (as H2S or HS-, reaction 1), is a key process in the dissolution of elemental sulfur:\nxS8 + H2S = Sx2- + 2 H+ (1)\nPolysulfides are inherently unstable in acidic conditions, experiencing a series of chain elongation reactions to form the S8 ring form of molecular elemental sulfur (overall this is the reverse of reaction 1).\nS8 rings are also inherently insoluble in water and undergo a very rapid coarsening process to form S8nano that then coarsens more slowly via an Ostwald ripening process to form colloidal particles of a-S8. Coarsening kinetics are influenced by temperature, and the presence/absence and type of surfactants [1]. The amount of polysulfide at any point is thus a balance between the forward and reverse overall reactions represented in reaction 1, and influenced by microbial generation of reduced sulfide and/or microbial production of organic surfactants, and the size of the elemental sulfur particles.\nHere we present some preliminary data on the kinetics of elemental sulfur consumption (reaction 1) that have been tested in various sizes and surface properties of the sulfur nanoparticles. The surface area and presence (or absence) of surfactant molecules influences the kinetics of polysulfide formation. The cycling of that reaction may play a significant role to the element’s bioavailability to microorganisms, which incorporate the nanoparticulate (rather than the bulk a-S8) form of elemental sulfur or polysulfides in their specific metabolisms [2].\n1.

            "abstract": "The Oak Ridge Leadership Facility (OLCF), established at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), welcomes investigators from universities, government agencies, national laboratories and industry who are prepared to perform breakthrough research across a broad domain of scientific disciplines, including earth and space sciences.\nTitan, the OLCF flagship system, is currently listed as #2 in the Top500 list of supercomputers in the world, and the largest available for open science. The computational resources are allocated primarily via the Innovative and Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment (INCITE) program, sponsored by the U.S. DOE Office of Science. In 2014, over 2.25 billion core hours on Titan were awarded via INCITE projects., including 14% of the allocation toward earth sciences. The INCITE competition is also open to research scientists based outside the USA. In fact, international research projects account for 12% of the INCITE awards in 2014. The INCITE scientific review panel also includes 20% participation from international experts.\nRecent accomplishments in earth sciences at OLCF include the world’s first continuous simulation of 21,000 years of earth’s climate history (2009); and an unprecedented simulation of a magnitude 8 earthquake over 125 sq. miles. One of the ongoing international projects involves scaling the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) model to over 200K cores of Titan. ECMWF is a partner in the EU funded Collaborative Research into Exascale Systemware, Tools and Applications (CRESTA) project. The significance of the research carried out within this project is the demonstration of techniques required to scale current generation Petascale capable simulation codes towards the performance levels required for running on future Exascale systems. One of the techniques pursued by ECMWF is to use Fortran2008 coarrays to overlap computations and communications and to reduce the total volume of data communicated. Use of Titan has enabled ECMWF to plan future scalability developments and resource requirements.\nWe will also discuss the best practices developed over the years in navigating logistical, legal and regulatory hurdles involved in supporting the facility’s diverse user community.",

            "abstract": "Glacial and tectonic processes on active margins are intrinsically coupled to the transport of sediment and associated organic carbon (OC). Glaciation/deglaciation and the formation of ice sheets can alter the quantity and composition of OC delivered to the marine environment. Over geologic time scales (>1 Ma), exhumation and mass wasting of sedimentary rock from uplifted accretionary wedges inject recycled OC (e.g. kerogen), along with modern OC into the marine environment.\nThe sedimentary record of glacial and tectonic processes along the southern Alaska margin is particularly well preserved at Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Site U1417. Lithofacies of Site U1417 can be divided into 3 sedimentary packages that we interpret as linked to the onset of tidewater glaciation along, and tectonic convergence of the Yakutat Terrane with, the continental margin of northwestern Canada and southern Alaska. Based on previous studies linking the development of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet and the movement of the Yakutat Terrane to the development of the Surveyor Fan System, we hypothesize biogeochemical variations in the deposited sediments as a result of changing provenance.\nPreservation of terrestrial OC that has been documented in sediments of the Alaskan continental shelf margin and sediment routing through the deep-sea Surveyor Channel from the Pleistocene to modern time implies a long-term conduit for this OC to reach the distal portion of the Surveyor Fan system. To correlate marine deposits with terrestrial formations, bulk geochemical and detailed biomarker analyses are used to delineate source material. Preliminary bulk OC content and stable carbon isotope analyses of the Yakataga, Poul Creek, and Kultheith Fms. reveal notable differences. Detailed biomarker analysis by pyrolysis-gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry has revealed further differences between the three primary formations. Using the biogeochemical fingerprints of the Yakataga, Poul Creek, and coal-bearing Kulthieth Fms., the source of sediments delivered to the Surveyor Fan over the past ~10Ma can be better determined, providing further insight into erosion patterns of the Yakutat Terrane during tectonic transport and under the influence of tidewater glaciation.",

            "abstract": "The objective of this work is to study the behavior of mesoscale cyclonic vortices (MCVs) over South America, principally those that form in association with the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ), with a view toward identifying the basic characteristics of the formation of these MCVs. Two case studies were conducted over the Continental Amazonia Zone, simulated using the BRAMS model, showing the relationship between the mesovortices formation and the convective activity near its formation region. A thermodynamic analysis of two selected MCVs, embedded in the SACZ, highlights some salient features of these intense MCVs. Both systems are associated with strong upward vertical motion throughout practically the whole troposphere, before and during formation. This motion creates a transport of moisture into the upper troposphere and the surface fluxes of sensible and latent heat are reduced when the MCVs are operating. These systems that form in more than one level in the troposphere are more intense and are associated with greater precipitation rates (over 150 mm). Another striking feature is that these systems dissipate quickly. With respect to the horizontal wind, there is no similarity in pattern between the two cases. The first case, where the base of the vortex formed at 925 hPa and extended to 875 hPa, was characterized by convergence of winds from the south - west of the vortex - with winds from the north - east of the vortex. In the second case, which extended from 800 hPa to 775 hPa, we can clearly see the motion, originating in central Brazil, transporting moisture toward the vortex and certainly serving as a local factor contributing significantly to the moisture balance in the region.",

To take this medium a step further, we use illustrations in the form of comics as a way to teach Earth science concepts. The comic book format lends itself to engaging reading for young and old alike and has been used recently by the American Physical Society (APS) and by NASA as an outreach teaching tool. Due to their sequential nature, comic books make it easy for readers to follow a story and grasp concepts that are covered. The limited text in each panel can also help those where reading is a challenge or for those who become nervous and/or discouraged with long text passages. The illustrations also add visual clues that can aid in understanding the concepts being laid out.\nIn the second installment of “Adventures of Geo,” we use the comic book format to introduce the Moon, its formation, evolution, orbit and its interplay with Earth. The exploration of such faraway places is readily disseminated to the public through such a graphical approach. The comic books are aimed at middle school students in the New Haven Public Schools (NHPS) where Earth Science topics are covered in the curriculum.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is expected to adversely influence the weather and may increase the severity of meteorological events, including thunderstorms capable of producing crop damaging hail. Hail events occurring on pre-harvest wheat fields are known to be a significant contributor to outbreaks of virus diseases such as Wheat streak mosaic virus, Triticum mosaic virus , and Wheat mosaic virus, in the subsequent year. These viruses are vectored by the wheat curl mite (WCM) and volunteer wheat from pre-harvest hail events provides WCMs with a green bridge between harvest in the summer and planting in the fall. Controlling volunteer wheat through herbicide application and tillage has been shown to reduce WSMV transmission as long as it is conducted before emergence of the winter wheat crop. The goal of this study was to develop a risk product for WCM-vectored viruses based on pre-harvest hail damage. Traditionally, vegetation indices (VI; i.e. normalized difference vegetation index) are used to remotely identify hail damage in satellite imagery. However, during the highest risk period for volunteer wheat resulting from pre-harvest hail damage, the wheat crop is senescing and dramatically reducing its ‘greenness’, decreasing its sensitivity to changes in many VIs. Ground-based hyperspectral remote sensing over mechanically hailed sites indicates that reflectance from hailed wheat increases in the visible/near infrared spectrum. This information can be incorporated into a model using satellite imagery (LandSat and MODIS) and a 1 x 1 km resolution map of estimated maximal hail size produced by NOAA. The risk maps produced from these inputs will enable farmers and stakeholders to more effectively manage WCM-vectored viruses of wheat.",

In this study, the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model is updated to enhance fine mode SSA emissions, include sea surface temperature (SST) dependency, and revise surf zone emissions. Based on evaluation with several regional and national observational datasets in the continental U.S., the updated emissions generally improve surface concentrations predictions of primary aerosols composed of sea-salt and secondary aerosols affected by sea-salt chemistry in coastal and near-coastal sites. Specifically, the updated emissions lead to better predictions of the magnitude and coastal-to-inland gradient of sodium, chloride, and nitrate concentrations at Bay Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (BRACE) sites near Tampa, FL. Including SST-dependency to the SSA emission parameterization leads to increased sodium concentrations in the southeast U.S. and decreased concentrations along the Pacific coast and northeastern U.S., bringing predictions into closer agreement with observations at most Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) and Chemical Speciation Network (CSN) sites. Model comparison with California Research at the Nexus of Air Quality and Climate Change (CalNex) observations will also be discussed, with particular focus on the South Coast Air Basin where clean marine air mixes with anthropogenic pollution in a complex environment.

Three WorldView-2 images (2m2 spatial resolution, 8 multispectral bands) were acquired in Jul/Aug of 2012-2014 over the Abisko region in northern Sweden. Color infrared (CIR) sub-meter imagery was also collected over a 4km2 area in 2014 using both a multi-rotor helicopter and a fixed wing unmanned aircraft system (UAS). Fifty 1m2 ground sample plots were established; these plots cover 5 major ground cover vegetation classes and were used in classification efforts. Texture analysis was conducted on both UAS and WV-2 imagery. Both an unsupervised k-means clustering algorithm to predict vegetation classes and a supervised classification using both random forests and neural networks were conducted; similar texture analysis and clustering were also performed on the UAS imagery. Classifications of the two imagery types were compared with promising results, thus supporting the use of UAS and high resolution satellite image collection to provide landscape level characterization of vegetation.",

            "abstract": "Intensively managed landscapes (IMLs) in the Midwestern United States are heavily modified by agriculture, artificial drainage, deforestation, urbanization, and wetland destruction. These landscapes have been shaped by repeated glacial events over geologic time scales followed with rapid human modifications for agriculture and drainage that are overlaid on extremely low gradient stream networks.\nIn this study, using LiDAR data from the Upper Sangamon River Basin in Illinois, we attempt to understand how the long-term glacial legacy has shaped the landscape and what is the impact from short-term human activities, such as channel straightening and periodic dredging. Glacial and human legacy impact landscape dynamics simultaneously. Therefore, we evaluate the present-day dynamics of landscapes by attempting to address several questions. First, we explore whether the watershed is in equilibrium conditions or away from it due to human activities. Second, we study how this relates to the degree of maturity in the river valley. Moreover, we map the spatial distributions of terraces and floodplains to understand depositional and erosional history.\nHigh-resolution LiDAR data is ideal for such a study as it reveals the impact of both glacial episodes and human activities. Methods used for extraction of useful information from LiDAR data include the TerEx tool, Stream Profiler, and Hec-GeoRas, among others. We analyze the terrace and floodplain geomorphic features, quantify stream sinuosity, and cross section geometries. An integral method is built based on stream power incision model to obtain sub-basin steady state condition. These features help to reveal local and global watershed properties. A bounded relationship between terraces/floodplains, sinuosity, cross section maturity, as well as sub-basin equilibrium condition is explored. In general, we find that the glacial legacy and present-day human activity have opposed each other in regards to the sub-basin equilibrium conditions of USRB. These studies of historic and recent floodplain dynamics from high-resolution topography will enhance our understanding of intensively managed landscapes, which will strengthen the understanding of watershed dynamics under human impact.",

            "abstract": "While the ability of aerosols to act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nuclei (IN) is well recognized, the effects of changing aerosol number concentrations on convective clouds have only been studied extensively in recent years. As deep convective clouds can produce heavy precipitation and may sometimes bring severe damages, especially in the tropics, we need to understand the changes in the convective systems that could stem from aerosol perturbations. By perturbing convective clouds, it has also been proposed that aerosols can affect large-scale climate. According to the convective invigoration mechanism, an increase in the aerosol concentration could lead to a larger amount of rainfall and higher vertical velocities in convective clouds, due to an increase in the latent heat release aloft. With some of the satellite observations supporting this mechanism, it is necessary to understand how sensitive the model simulations actually are to aerosol perturbations. This study uses the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model as a cloud-resolving model to reproduce deep convective clouds observed during the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) field campaign. The convective cloud of our interest was observed in northeastern Colorado on June 22nd in 2012, with a plume of forest fire smoke flowing into its core. Compared to other convective cells observed in the same area on different days, our aircraft data analysis shows that the convective cloud in question included more organic aerosols and more CCN. These indicate the influence of the biomass burning. We compare the results from simulations with different microphysics schemes and different cloud or ice number concentrations. These sensitivity tests tell us how different the amount and the pattern of precipitation would have been if the aerosol concentration had been higher or lower on that day. Both the sensitivity to aerosol perturbation and the reproducibility of the storm are shown to highly depend on the choice of the microphysics scheme.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost-affected soils are among the most fragile ecosystems in which current microbial controls on organic matter decomposition are changing as a result of climate change. Warmer conditions in the high Arctic will lead to a deepening of the seasonal active layer of permafrost, provoking changes in microbial processes and possibly resulting in exacerbated carbon degradation under increasing anoxic conditions. The viable and non-viable fractions of the microbial community in a permafrost soil from Adventdalen, Spitsbergen, Norway were subjected to a comprehensive investigation using culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. Molecular analyses using FISH (with CTC-DAPI) and amplified rDNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) on a 257cm deep core, revealed the presence of all major microbial soil groups, with the active layer having more viable cells, and a higher microbial community diversity. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) flux measurements were performed to show the amount of C stored in the sample. We demonstrated that the microbial community composition from the soil in the center of the core was most likely influenced by small scale variations in environmental conditions. Community structure showed distinct shift of presence of bacterial groups along the vertical temperature gradient profile and microbial counts and diversity was found to be highest in the surface layers, decreasing with depth. It was observed that soil properties driving microbial diversity and functional potential varied across the permafrost table. Data on the variability of CO2 and CH4 distribution described in peat structure heterogeneity are important for modeling emissions on a larger scale. Furthermore, linking microbial biomass to gas distribution may elucidate the cause of peak CO2 and CH4 and their changes in relation to environmental change and peat composition.",

Partnering with local community colleges, non-traditional students are the hallmark of this program. The IDES program has several components to support the students in the transition from community college to the four-year universities of Oregon State University and Portland State University. Over the four years, the program has adapted while adhering to its primary goals: (1) to increase the number of students from underrepresented groups who prepare for and pursue careers in Earth Science research and education, and (2) to strengthen the understanding of Earth Sciences and their relevance to society among broad and diverse segments of the population.\nNow in its final year under an extension, 53 participants have participated in the program. An ongoing external evaluation of the program reveals that the various stakeholders consider IDES very successful. Participant surveys and interviews document several impacts: expanded opportunities, making professional contacts, building self-confidence, enhanced ability to be employable, and personal acknowledgement. Research mentors and administrators from partner institutions see positive impacts on the students and on their organizations. Challenges include better communication between the IDES program, mentors, and students.\nIDES is poised to move forward with its current experiences and successes as a foundation for further funding. IDES-like activities can be funded from private sources and it is a good fit for funding from Research Experiences for Undergraduates at NSF. The new emphasis on education and research at community colleges is an exciting opportunity and Oregon State University has already used aspects of the IDES program in current grant proposals to obtain funds for more undergraduate research.",

            "abstract": "Lithotrophic reactions, including the oxidation of mineral species, are often difficult to detect in environmental systems. This could be due to the nature of substrate or metabolite quantification or the rapid consumption of metabolic end products or intermediates by proximate biological or abiotic processes. Though recently genetic markers have been applied to detecting these processes in environmental systems, our knowledge of lithotrophic markers are limited to those processes catalyzed by organisms that have been cultured and physiologically characterized. Here we describe the use of electrochemical enrichment techniques to isolate marine sediment-dwelling microbes capable of the oxidation or insoluble forms of iron and sulfur including both the elemental species. All the organisms isolated fall within the Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria and are capable of acquiring electrons from an electrode while using either oxygen or nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor. Electrochemical analysis of these microbes has demonstrated that, though they have similar geochemical abilities (either sulfur or iron oxidation), they likely utilize different biochemical mechanisms demonstrated by the variability in dominant electron transfer modes or interactions (i.e., biofilm, planktonic or mediator facilitated interactions) and the wide range of midpoint potentials observed for dominant redox active cellular components (ranging from -293 to +50 mV vs. Ag/AgCl). For example, organisms isolated on elemental sulfur tended to have higher midpoint potentials than iron-oxidizing microbes. A variety of techniques are currently being applied to understanding the different mechanisms of extracellular electron transport for oxidizing an electrode or corresponding insoluble electron donor including both genomic and genetic manipulation experiments. The insight gained from these experiments is not limited to the physiology of the organisms isolated but will also aid in identification of genetic targets to better understand the ecologic importance of lithotrophs and the role solid substrates may play in their metabolism.",

            "abstract": "The enormous advances in scientific understanding of the earth in the last 400 years led to a remarkable flourishing of humanity, but it also resulted in the disruption of critical systems on which we depend. Around the world, soil is lost faster than it forms; groundwater is withdrawn faster than it recharges; biodiversity and biocapacity are crashing; fossil fuels are 87% of our primary energy sources despite their many problems, including steadily rising emissions of CO2. Since 1600, science has honed an ethic of objectivity that insists that facts and values – scientific work and its real world outcomes – remain separate. As a result, our economy and society applaud as loudly when our graduates land jobs that further damage earth systems as when they seek to preserve them. Geoethics aims at the idea that balancing human action with the capacity of planetary systems is the primary “good.” Without healthy systems, we cannot thrive. Period. Ethical systems developed to mediate human relations are inadequate to find this balance: they implicitly acknowledge a rationality that places the highest value on short-term growth and efficiency, not on living sustainably in the long run. The best paragon of sustainability is the co-evolution of life and other systems on our planet over 3.5 billion years.\n This presentation explores the contributions of Gregory Bateson and other scientists to understanding systems in cybernetic terms. Bateson suggested that “What we believe ourselves to be should be compatible with what we believe of the world around us.” In other words, the path to a sustainable geoethics begins by re-internalizing lessons that humans alone in the biotic community seem to have forgotten. What are the “rules” by which systems sustain themselves? What do self-sustaining systems “value?” How can we help ourselves and our students learn them? I suggest that paying attention to the process of learning itself is an effective first step, and describe the use of a learning cycle model based on system cybernetics. The model provides a structure in which we and our students can reflect on our connections with the world and the limitations on what we can learn about it. I also show how to use campus and other landscapes to clarify the gap between human ethics and a sustainable geoethics.",

            "abstract": "Technologies that serve as a bridge between renewable energy and fossil fuels are needed to meet growing energy demands and to mitigate climate change. Many reservoirs contain difficult to produce residual and/or heavily biodegraded (i.e., geochemically altered) crude oil, which remains a relatively untapped resource. Production of this residual crude oil via unconventional methods, such as enhanced oil recovery (EOR), has offset some of the decline in conventional oil production. EOR is not efficient enough to recover all of the original oil in place, and some methods are not effective for very heavy crude oils. Stimulation of in-situ microorganisms to convert the residual crude oil to natural gas (i.e., microbial methane) is one promising strategy to “extract” residual and /or heavy crude oil. Although the hydrogeochemical conditions necessary for the occurrence of both crude oil biodegradation and microbial methanogenesis in various reservoirs have been studied, there are still gaps in research. Many hydrogeochemical factors have been researched individually (not as part of a multifactor or lithologically similar system) and little work has assessed the microbiological limitations of both processes. Our goal is to determine the hydrogeochemical and microbiological conditions required for maximum crude oil biodegradation and microbial methanogenesis across a lithologically similar unit. Produced water, oil, gas, and microbial biomass samples were collected from wells completed in the Paleocene—Eocene Wilcox Group in central Louisiana. Initial results indicate potential relationships between the amount of crude oil biodegradation, indicators of microbial methanogenesis, and aqueous geochemistry. For example, produced waters with the lowest salinity had the highest crude oil biodegradation, and wells exhibiting the most microbial methane generation produce waters with hydrogeochemical conditions most fit for methanogenesis to occur. In sampled wells displaying similar hydrogeochemical conditions (e.g., similar temperatures), indicators of methanogenesis, such as δ13C dissolved inorganic carbon values, are more pronounced in wells displaying oils that are more biodegraded, suggesting methanogenesis may be accelerated with greater amounts of crude oil biodegradation.",

In this work, we employ a two-domain approach to model flow through and over submerged canopies. The model, amenable of a closed-form solution, couples the log-law and the Darcy-Brinkman equation, and is characterized by a novel representation of the drag force that does not rely on a parametrization through an unknown drag coefficient. This approach limits to one, i.e., the obstruction permeability, the number of free parameters. Analytical expressions for the average velocity profile through and above the canopies, volumetric flow rate, penetration length, and canopy shear layer parameter are obtained in terms of the canopy layer effective permeability. The model suggests that appropriately rescaled velocities in the canopy and surface layers follow two different scaling laws. The analytical predictions match with the experimental data collected by Ghisalberti and Nepf (2004) and Nepf et al. (2007).",

            "abstract": "Fecal contamination in urban waterways is a major public and environmental health threat. Sanitary sewer and combined sewer overflows are major point sources of fecal pollution. Additionally, stormwater runoff and failing sewer infrastructure contribute fecal contamination and pathogens to urban waterways. Traditionally, fecal indicator bacteria such as E. coli, enterococci, and fecal coliforms are used to gauge fecal contamination in water; however, these general indicators are unable to distinguish fecal sources in the environment. This study used two human-specific fecal indicator bacteria to identify human sewage contamination in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where three rivers form an estuary that discharges to Lake Michigan. Two-hour composite samples were collected at four sites, one in each of the three rivers and one in the estuary, to represent the entire hydrograph before, during, and after a rain event. Samples were collected throughout a variety of conditions, including dry-weather baseline, light and heavy rain events, and combined sewage overflows (CSOs). These samples were analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays to determine human sewage loads in each river during each type of event. Low levels of human indicators were found during dry-weather baseline conditions, and loads increased significantly (one to two orders of magnitude) during rain events. Sampling upstream of the estuary indicated sewage contamination was originating in the heavily urbanized part of the watersheds, likely a result of failing infrastructure. CSO events contributed the highest loads, which were on average ten-fold higher than rainfall events with no CSO. This information will be a useful for directing the efforts of local agencies and municipalities to investigate failing infrastructure, as well as agencies at the state and federal levels to create appropriate goals to address the human health concerns that are posed by sewage contamination in urban waterways.",

            "abstract": "Global estimates of phytoplankton biomass (Cphyto) and particulate organic carbon (POC) have traditionally been made using passive ocean color measurements. Recently, data from the CALIOP sensor on the CALIPSO satellite have provided the first measurements of these two key carbon cycle stocks from a space-based lidar. Although CALIOP was not designed for subsurface ocean retrievals, global distributions of Cphyto and POC retrieved with CALIOP compare well with independent assessments using MODIS passive ocean color data. This success suggests a potentially important future role for space lidar measurements in global ocean plankton research, particularly for a lidar system optimized for water column profiling. To this end, the NASA Langley airborne High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) was recently modified for ocean research to provide independent vertically-resolved retrievals of the diffuse attenuation coefficient (Kd) and particulate backscatter coefficient (bbp). The advanced HSRL has been deployed on three ocean-focused airborne field missions: a mission based in the Azores in October 2012, a CALIPSO validation mission based in Bermuda in June 2014, and the Ship-Aircraft Bio-Optical Research (SABOR) experiment based in Bermuda, New Hampshire, and Virginia in July-August of 2014. On the Azores and SABOR missions, the HSRL instrument acquired data coincident with ship-based optical measurements, and data were acquired along CALIOP tracks on all three missions. Results from the airborne HSRL and CALIOP studies will be described, along with a discussion of potential future aircraft campaigns, the scalability of the HSRL technique to space, and the value of simultaneously measuring plankton abundance, marine aerosol loading and optical properties, and cloud microphysical properties and albedo.",

            "abstract": "The Guatemala Suture Zone (GSZ) features two serpentinite mélanges straddling the Motagua Fault system. In both North and South Motagua Mélanges (NMM and SMM, respectively), blocks of high-pressure, low-temperature metabasites (e.g., eclogites) are embedded into a serpentinite matrix, together with vein-related rocks (e.g., jadeitites). The origin of serpentinite forming the matrix is still unclear. It is commonly believed to represent either the seafloor / oceanic mantle hydrated by infiltration of seawater or the forearc mantle wedge hydrated by fluid released during subduction. Nowadays, the few data available on serpentinites from Mariana forearc, abyssal peridotite or ophiolitic massifs show positive or slightly negative δ11B (-4.6 to +40‰), in support of the assumption of a shallow origin for the fluid. However, it has been suggested that serpentinites could form much deeper within a subduction channel (~ 30 km depth).\nIn situ boron analyses on antigorite from serpentinites of the GSZ have been carried out by LA-MC-ICPMS and SIMS. Serpentine matrices have low to moderate B concentrations, between 2 and 15µg/g. They display somewhat negative isotopic values, with δ11B of -8.2 ± 2.8 and -11.9 ± 1.2‰ for samples from the NMM, and δ11B of -4.1 ± 3.0 and -11.1 ± 1.8‰ for a sample from the SMM. In addition, this sample contains a late antigorite vein showing a δ11B of -3.0 ± 3.5‰, and some veinlets with scattered values (δ11B ranging from -12.5 ± 0.9 to -6.4 ± 1.4‰).\nThis first suite of measurements carried out directly on serpentinites from serpentinite mélanges displays very negative values, which do not overlap with previously published data. It indicates that the ultramafic precursors of the serpentine from the GSZ Serpentinite Mélanges were not hydrated by seawater, or by fluid released during the early stages of subduction. Rather, these negative values indicate that the fluid responsible for the hydration of ultramafic rocks likely comes from deep stages of slab devolatilization, in agreement with the hypothesis of deep serpentinite formation in the subduction channel. Thus, the serpentinite matrix of the mélanges probably represents hydrated mantle wedge.",

            "abstract": "Previous studies on interactions between the atmospheric waves and ionospheric perturbations concluded that the acoustic-gravity waves triggered by solid earth events such as earthquakes, tsunamis and underground nuclear tests may be used in detecting the ionospheric perturbations. Ionospheric perturbations have been observed using sounding radars and GPS remote sensing techniques since 1970s. As primary examples, ionospheric disturbances associated with 2006 and 2009 North Korean underground nuclear tests were observed using GPS measurements.\nIn this work, we processed GNSS stations in South Korea and Japan and analyzed traveling ionospheric disturbances that were coincident with the 2013 North Korean underground test. North Korea conducted the third underground nuclear test at 2:57 UTC on February 12, 2013. The magnitude of earthquake generated by this event was registered to be an Mw 5.1 event. After analyzing GPS measurements from nearby stations, strong ionospheric perturbations were observed 15-30 minutes after the reported event, and the disturbances were shown to have primarily two different wave trains. The maximum VTEC perturbations turned out to be between 0.4 to 0.7 TECU. Five stations located in the northwest-to-southeast direction were also scrutinized for the propagation direction and amplitude variation related to ionospheric wave structures. The results clearly showed that the maximum amplitude of the waves may be higher as the stations are closer to the epicenter indicating that the waveforms may propagate away from the epicenter. In this research, we will analyze the characteristics of the detected ionospheric perturbations associated with the underground nuclear test. These findings are expected to verify our modeling results. We hope to get a better understanding of the influence of man-made hazards on the temporal and spatial variability of the global ionosphere.",

            "abstract": "Numerous land subsidence events have been recently reported from central and northern parts of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in Hail, Al Qassim, Al Jowf, and Buraydah Provinces. In some cases, these incidences resulted in losses in life and property. In this study, an integrated (field, geologic, remote sensing) approach is applied to accomplish the following: (1) identify the spatial distribution and extent of areas affected by subsidence (TASK I), (2) identify the factor(s) causing such subsidence (TASK II), and (3) identify areas threatened by such phenomena across northern and central parts of the Kingdom using criteria extracted from TASK II (TASK III). A three-fold approach was applied: (1) visits were conducted to collect field observations from reported subsidence locations, (2) spatial correlations were implemented in a web-based GIS environment for the reported subsidence locations in relation to relevant co-registered static datasets (e.g., rock and soil types, geologic structures) and temporal datasets (e.g., groundwater extraction, landuse/landcover, distribution and magnitude of earthquakes), (3) subsidence rates were extracted applying the Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) radar interferometric technique and using European Remote Sensing satellite-1 (ERS-1), ERS-2, and the Environmental Satellite (Envisat) data sets. Our findings (from radar interferometric studies) indicate that the distribution of areas undergoing subsidence are consistent/correlate with: (1) reported subsidence locations, but reveal many additional unreported subsidence locations, (2) irrigated lands, especially those witnessing a progressive increase in agricultural activities with time; (3) outcrops of the Saq sandstone aquifer system, the main source for fresh groundwater in the Kingdom, (4) outcrops the Minjur limestone formation that are subject to karstification; and (5) urban centers lacking appropriate sewage and drainage systems.",

            "abstract": "Most fast coronal mass ejections (CMEs) originate from solar active regions (ARs). Non-potentiality of ARs is expected to determine the speed and size of CMEs in the outer corona. Several other unexplored parameters might be important as well. To find out the correlation between the initial speed of CMEs and the non-potentiality of source ARs, we associated over a hundred of CMEs with source ARs via their co-produced flares. The speed of the CMEs are collected from the SOHO LASCO CME catalog. We have used vector magnetograms obtained mainly with HMI/SDO, also with Hinode (SOT/SP) when available within an hour of a CME occurence, to evaluate various magnetic non-potentiality parameters, e.g. magnetic free-energy proxies, computed magnetic free energy, twist, shear angle, signed shear angle etc. We have also included several other parameters e.g. total unsigned flux, net current, magnetic area of ARs, area of sunspots, to investigate their correlation, if any, with the initial speeds of CMEs. Our preliminary results show that the ARs with larger non-potentiality and area mostly produce fast CMEs but they can also produce slower ones. The ARs with lesser non-potentiality and area generally produce only slower CMEs, however, there are a few exceptions. The total unsigned flux correlate with the non-potentiality parameters and area of ARs but some ARs with large unsigned flux are also found to be least non-potential.

            "abstract": "The opening and closure of ocean gateways play an important role amongst climate forcing mechanisms: surface and deep-water circulation are altered, and hence global heat transport. An important component of North Atlantic circulation patterns is the warm and saline Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) that enters the North Atlantic via the Gibraltar Strait. Its onset and early history after the opening of the Gibraltar Strait at 5.3 Ma are poorly constrained and its impact on oceanography and climate in the Pliocene are largely unexplored. Current research efforts in the scope of projects funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF-P25831-N29) and the Max Kade Foundation aim to improve our knowledge about this early phase of MOW. Research focuses on Sites U1387C (upper Miocene-lower Pliocene; ~5.8-3.8 Myrs) and U1389E (middle-upper Pliocene; ~3.7-2.8) drilled during IODP Expedition 339 in the northern Gulf of Cádiz close to the source area of MOW.\nAt IODP Site U1389E, a 280m-thick sequence of upper Pliocene contourites is studied to reconstruct MOW behavior and potential paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic feedback mechanisms during the Mid-Pliocene Thermal Optimum. Currently, a reliable age model is developed for the studied interval based on bio-, chemo-, and cyclostratigraphy. Several biostratigraphic datums have been identified from analyses of calcareous nannoplankton and planktic foraminifera which indicate a depositional age between 3.65 Ma and 2.87 Ma. In some intervals of the record a further refinement of the age model at the millenial scale is complicated by poor recovery. However, preliminary results from high-resolution geochemical analyses of the bulk sediment (TOC, CaCO3 and S) and shells of the planktic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber (δ18O, δ13C) reveal distinct cyclic patterns in several well recovered intervals. Based on an average sedimentation rate of ~25cm/ka, these cycles most likely reflect precessional forcing. Current paleoceanographic research on the late Pliocene history of MOW focuses on these well-recovered intervals and rely on the combination of δ18O and Mg/Ca records of benthic foraminifera and Zr/Al records collected by XRF-scanning of the core material.",

            "abstract": "To a large part, the seismicity of Switzerland is characterized by swarm-like earthquake sequences of natural, and to a minor extent of man-made origin. Many of these sequences have been studied using relative location techniques, which often allowed to constrain the active fault plane of the larger events in a sequence and shed light on the tectonic processes that drive the seismicity. Yet, in the majority of cases the number of located earthquakes was too small to infer the details of the space-time evolution of the sequences, and their statistical parameters (e.g. magnitude-frequency distribution, Omori parameters). Therefore, it has been largely impossible to resolve clear patterns in the seismicity of individual earthquake sequences that are needed to improve our understanding of the mechanisms behind, and the differences between natural and induced earthquake sequences.\nHere we show how a combination of well-established seismological tools can significantly improve the completeness of detected and located earthquakes in surface network catalogs. By taking advantage of the waveform similarity in natural and induced earthquake sequences in Switzerland we are able to detect seismic events several orders of magnitude below the detection threshold of classical signal energy based detectors. For this purpose we have implemented a multi-trace cross-correlation detector that either runs in “template mode” using a set of representative earthquakes (templates) of a sequence, or in “sub-space mode” using characteristic waveforms derived from the templates by singular value decomposition. Waveform similarity is then further exploited to derive accurate and consistent earthquake magnitudes for the sequences. Finally we derive a similarity-distance relationship from a set of double-difference re-located events with larger magnitudes (DD reference set) for each sequence. These relationships are then used to locate tiny earthquakes, which are often only recorded at one station, with respect to the DD reference sets using a cross-correlation location technique.\nIn this way it is possible to provide earthquake scientist with the data they need to better understand the processes and physics behind natural and induced microseismicity.",

            "abstract": "X-ray tomography is an important noninvasive tool for characterizing the structural features of many materials, including soils. Spatial resolution is typically limited to ~10 μm voxels for lab-based systems and ~1 μm voxels for many synchrotron-based systems. However, many properties relevant to aqueous-phase reactive transport in natural systems take place at finer length scales. Recent developments in x-ray imaging, such as phase contrast imaging, have indicated that the use of a patterning element (such as a grating) in the beam can allow measurement of small-angle elastic scattering, which can be used to detect regions that include sub-resolution particles while still providing a 3-D image with a large field of view. We investigated the use of gratings-based phase contrast x-ray imaging for identifying regions containing sub-resolution particles. Investigations of model materials with controlled size distributions, and of natural materials, showed that regions including clay minerals could be distinguished within analyzed volumes. We also investigated procedures for tuning the measurement system to optimize the sensitivity to specific length scales. The use of a patterning element presents a useful extension to conventional x-ray imaging, which will aid in the characterization of unresolved porous regions in soils and other materials.",

            "abstract": "A downscaling framework is presented and applied to physiological and climatic data for projecting future climate resilience of one key boreal tree species, black spruce, in Cape Breton Highlands, Nova Scotia. The technique is based on a combination of probabilistic downscaling methods and control system theory, which together are used to transform large-scale future climate input (air temperature, humidity) to local scale climate parameters important to plant biophysical processes (vapor pressure deficit). Large-scale forecast data from the Community Earth System Model were downscaled spatially then temporally based on the cumulative distributions and sub-daily patterns from corresponding observational data at North Mountain (Cape Breton). Validation over historical decades shows that this technique provides hourly temperature and vapor pressure deficit data accurate to within 0.7%. Further we applied these environmental factors to a species specific empirical model of stomatal conductance for black spruce to compare differences in predicted water regulation response when large-scale (ESM) data are used as drivers versus localized data transformed using this new site-level downscaling technique. We observe through this synthetic study that over historical to contemporary periods (1850-2006) differences between large-scale and localized forecasts of stomatal conductance were small but that future climate extremes (2006-2100) have a strong effect on derived water balance in black spruce. These results also suggest that black spruce in the Cape Breton Highlands may have biophysical responses to climate change that are not predicted by spatially coarse (1°) data, which does not include site level extremes that in this study are shown to strongly curb future growth rates in black spruce as present day climate extremes become common place.",

            "abstract": "How hillslope shape and structure affect the spatial and temporal variability of streamflow is a key question in catchment hydrology. In particular, the role of hillslope structure and arrangement in mediating the longitudinal variability of streamflow in first-order headwater catchments remains poorly understood. Here we assess the spatio-temporal variability of streamflow under baseflow conditions in forested headwater catchments characterized by different topography and vegetation. We studied the relationship between hillslope structure and baseflow along a series of first-order streams using a combination of in-stream water isotope sampling, stream gauging, and geospatial analysis. We studied two pairs of small (< 15 ha) forested catchments at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory (CHL), a long-term ecological research (LTER) site in the southern Appalachian Mountains. The catchments comprise different combinations of aspect (north and south) and vegetation type (deciduous and evergreen), and they contain hillslopes covering a range of sizes. We sampled water along first-order streams, from shallow hillslope wells, and from rainfall collectors distributed across CHL. These monthly samples, collected from June 2011 through June 2013, were analyzed for stable isotopes of water (18O and 2H) using laser spectrometry. During the same period, we quantified longitudinal changes in stream discharge at different baseflow states for each catchment and developed discharge versus contributing area relationships along streams within each continuously gauged catchment. We found relationships between stream water isotopic composition, landscape variables, and hillslope discharge, which was estimated as the difference in streamflow between consecutive measurement locations. Results showed that landscape heterogeneity exerts a strong control over longitudinal variability of baseflow by modulating the timing and volume of lateral flow along the stream gradient. However, the strength of relationships changed with seasons and flow states, suggesting that seasonality and climate interact with hillslope structure and arrangement to either enhance or dampen the influence of landscape heterogeneity on streamflow in headwater catchments.",

            "abstract": "As part of an NSF PIRE grant, we have led four field trips for undergraduate, MS and PhD students to large deltaic systems. Three trips took US students to the Ganges-Brahmaputra (GB) delta in Bangladesh and one brought Bangladeshi faculty and students to the Mississippi (Miss.) delta in the US. An essential component in the learning process and overall experience of each trip was that ~2/5 of the participants were students and professors from Bangladesh. In all cases, the involvement of a substantial international cohort greatly broadened perspectives on the topics being covered. For example, in GBD the local geologic and cultural knowledge of the Bangladeshis deepened the learning and engagement of the US students, an outcome that was almost universally noted in student reviews. The trips received similar feedback from Bangladeshi participants, as they had an enthusiastic and engaged audience of peers from the US. Even for the Miss. delta trip, the Bangladeshis added a unique perspective from a nation that faces similar environmental issues. These overwhelmingly positive contributions have been experienced in several different contexts. Three trips were associated with US courses and run over Spring Break. One matched sustainable development undergrads at Columbia U. with geology undergrads from Dhaka U., and two others matched a mixed group of graduate and undergrad students from Vanderbilt U. with cohorts from Bangladesh. The fourth trip was a stand-alone Field School for PhD students from 14 US universities and mostly MS students from 4 Bangladeshi universities. The focus of each trip ranged from broader surveys of tectonic, fluvial and coastal processes to investigations of geology and people affected by tropical storms. Of particular interest was the success of mixing undergrad and graduate students in the Vanderbilt course, which centered on the intersection of social sciences, physical sciences, and engineering. In this case, undergrads engaged in a liberal arts education brought a generally broader perspective than the more specialized graduate students. Overcoming this condition for the grad students is one of the principal reasons that the course was designed, and incorporating undergrads involved in the humanities and social disciplines invigorated these transdisciplinary aspects of the course.",

            "abstract": "The 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland caused the cancellation of approximately 108,000 flights over an 8-day period, disrupted air traffic worldwide, and cost the airline industry more than $400 million per day. The inconvenience and economic impact of this and similar events, such as Puyehue-Cordon-Caulle in 2011, have heightened the interest in developing improved satellite remote sensing techniques for monitoring volcanic plumes and drifting clouds.   For aviation safety, the operational/research community has started to move towards classifying the concentrations within volcanic plumes and clouds. Additionally, volcanic ash transport and dispersion (VATD) models are often used for forecasting ash cloud locations and they require knowledge of the structure of the erupting column to improve their ash simulations and also downwind 3-D maps of the ash cloud to calibrate/validate their modeling output.   Existing remote sensing satellites utilize a brightness temperature method with thermal infrared (TIR) measurements from 10 – 12 μm to determine mass loading of volcanic ash along a single line of sight, but they have infrequent revisit times and they cannot resolve the three-dimensional structure of the ash clouds. A cluster of CubeSats dedicated to the monitoring of volcanic ash and plumes could provide both more frequent updates and the multi-aspect images needed to resolve the density structure of volcanic ash clouds and plumes.   In this presentation, we discuss the feasibility and requirements for a CubeSat TIR imaging system and the associated on-board image processing that would be required to monitor the structure of volcanic ash clouds from Low Earth Orbit.",

            "abstract": "The deeper, inner parts of active accretionary prisms have been poorly studied due the lack of drilling data, low seismic image quality and typically thick overlying sediments. Our project focuses on the interior of the Nankai Trough inner accretionary prism using deep scientific drilling and a 3D seismic cube. International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 348 extended the existing riser hole to more than 3000 meters below seafloor (mbsf) at Site C0002. Logging while drilling (LWD) data included gamma ray, resistivity, resistivity image, and sonic logs. LWD analysis of the lower section revealed on the borehole images intense deformation characterized by steep bedding, faults and fractures. Bedding plane orientations were measured throughout, with minor gaps at heavily deformed zones disrupting the quality of the resistivity images. Bedding trends are predominantly steeply dipping (60-90°) to the NW. Interpretation of fractures and faults in the image log revealed the existence of different sets of fractures and faults and variable fracture density, remarkably high at fault zones. Gamma ray, resistivity and sonic logs indicated generally homogenous lithology interpretation along this section, consistent with the “silty-claystone” predominant lithologies described on cutting samples. Drops in sonic velocity were observed at the fault zones defined on borehole images. Seismic reflection interpretation of the deep faults in the inner prism is exceedingly difficult due to a strong seafloor multiple, high-angle bedding dips, and low frequency of the data. Structural reconstructions were employed to test whether folding of seismic horizons in the overlying forearc basin could be from an interpreted paleothrust within the inner prism. We used a trishear-based restoration to estimate fault slip on folded horizons landward of C0002. We estimate ~500 m of slip from a steeply dipping deep thrust within the last ~0.9 Ma. Folding is not found in the Kumano sediments near C0002, where normal faults and tilting dominate the modern basin deformation. Both logging and seismic are consistent in characterizing a heavily deformed inner prism. Most of this deformation must have occurred during or before formation of the overlying modern Kumano forearc basin sediments.",

            "abstract": "The last interglaciation (LIG; Marine Isotope Stage 5, ~129-116 ka) was the most recent period in Earth history with significantly higher-than-present global sea level (≥6 m) and as such is commonly used as an intercomparison target for global paleoclimate modeling efforts. However, the spatio-temporal expression and amplitude of temperature variability during the LIG remain poorly constrained, primarily confounded by spurious chronostratigraphic control across ocean basins and between hemispheres. In contrast to the relatively well-dated Holocene, age models for the LIG are problematic in that both the onset and duration of peak interglacial conditions are assigned different ages and lengths based on the record and/or chronometer considered (e.g., ice cores, speleothems, corals, marine sediment cores). Moreover, marine proxy records spanning the LIG are frequently aligned to reference time series targets and assigned some somewhat arbitrary chronological uncertainty. Building a spatially coherent time frame for the LIG must include a robust characterization of age-model uncertainty, as this greatly affects what climatic features and patterns can be confidently resolved in global and regional LIG temperature estimates. Here, we assess the total chronological uncertainty that results from developing an age model based on climatostratigraphic alignment of high-latitude Southern Ocean sea-surface temperature reconstructions to an Antarctic ice-core deuterium record using a modified version of a cross-correlation maximization algorithm. Combining this modified cross-correlation maximization algorithm with a Monte Carlo randomization scheme, we generate a coherent and robust quantification of climatostratigraphic LIG age-model uncertainty to refine regional and global estimates of LIG temperatures.",

            "abstract": "The steep cliffs of Yosemite Valley produce dozens of rock falls each year that pose a hazard to the four million annual visitors to Yosemite National Park. To better understand rock-fall processes, we use 156 years of rock fall data to examine temporal and spatial correlations between rock falls and seasonality, environmental conditions, and rock type. We also investigate the complexity of rock fall triggers, the most notably precipitation-related triggers (precipitation, snowmelt, rain-on-snow), earthquakes, thermal stress, and freeze-thaw. Comparing rock fall occurrences and cumulative precipitation plots for 16 years between 1983 and 2011 demonstrates a temporal correlation between precipitation and rock falls; this is corroborated by the observation of 17 rock falls that occurred within a one-week period of significant precipitation in late winter 2014. Yet there are many rock falls that do not coincide with precipitation; we attribute these to other triggers when clear temporal correlations exist, or, lacking clear temporal correlations, we investigate possible factors involved in “unrecognized” triggers. The large number of rock falls in the database (925) affords the opportunity to establish a volume-frequency relation similar to that of earthquakes. We also investigate both the frequency and volume of rock falls for each significant lithologic unit exposed in Yosemite Valley and find that two units in particular, the granodiorite of Arch Rock and the granodiorite of Kuna Crest, produce higher rates of rock fall relative to the other lithologies. The aim of these analyses is to better understand conditions that contribute to rock fall and to increase understanding of rock-fall hazard within Yosemite National Park.",

            "abstract": "High-latitude auroral arcs are a typical feature of periods of northward IMF. They consist in thin and elongated optical emission similar to discrete auroral arcs but located in the polar ionosphere. Their formation mechanism and the magnetospheric regions to which they are connected are still not well understood.\nOn November 10, 2005, high-latitude arcs were detected by an all-sky camera at Resolute Bay in Canada and by the TIMED/GUVI and DMSP/SUSIE space-based imagers. These observations indicate that they were detaching from the duskside auroral oval and then drifting poleward while pointing in the cusp direction. The same day, the Cluster spacecraft were flying in the dawn-dusk direction from the lobe region at altitudes ~5 RE to the magnetospheric equatorial plane at geocentric distances ~19 RE. Cluster observations reveal the presence of field-aligned acceleration regions above the polar ionosphere associated with the high-latitude arcs detected by the imagers.\nWe analyze Cluster particle observations from the lobe region to the duskside magnetopause. In the high-latitude arcs region, Cluster detects upgoing ions and precipitating electrons accelerated by a quasi-static electric field. These accelerated particles coexist with plasmasheet-like plasma embedded in the lobe region. A comparison between the 4 Cluster spacecraft electron measurements for the most poleward arc reveals that the plasmasheet-like electron population is vanishing on a time scale of a few minutes while the plasmasheet-like ion population doesn’t display any temporal evolution. The most equatorward arc is separated from the auroral oval by a “transition” region where weak fluxes of ions with plasmasheet like temperatures are detected. Then the Cluster spacecraft cross the plasmasheet until they reach the low-latitude boundary layer (LLBL) characterized by a mixture of plasmasheet and magnetosheath plasma. The “transition” region and the LLBL are magnetically connected. Using Cluster observations we show that these two regions display many similar features which suggest that the origin of high-latitude auroral arcs may be related to processes occurring in the LLBL during periods of northward IMF. We’ll discuss the implication of these observations on the formation mechanisms of high-latitude auroral arcs.",

            "abstract": "In recent years a number of studies have suggested that foreshore sand and porewater can act as a non-point source of microbial contamination to adjacent surface waters. Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) can be released from the sand into the surface water through sand erosion or wave-induced porewater flows leading to FIB detachment. Although regression models often show that there is a strong correlation between wave events and high E. coli in surface waters, there is limited understanding of the mechanisms by which E. coli is transported from the subsurface foreshore reservoir (sand and porewater) to surface waters during wave events. An improved understanding of the transport mechanisms will facilitate the development of better water quality exceedences predictions. Detailed groundwater flow, sand level and E. coli measurements were conducted at Ipperwash Beach, Lake Huron (Ontario) for three wave events during the 2014 bathing season to evaluate the relative contribution of sand erosion and wave-induced pore water flow in transporting E. coli from the subsurface reservoir to the shallow waters. As expected, results indicate increased E. coli concentrations in ankle and waist deep surface water during periods of increased wave activity (wave height > 0.5m). Considerable sand erosion from the foreshore may have contributed to these increased surface water concentrations. The E. coli concentrations in the foreshore reservoir generally decreased as the wave height intensified, while E. coli concentrations in upshore sand and porewater locations increased.",

The entire digital record of USGS instantaneous data is used to determine the number of discharge peaks over this threshold per year of data for all USGS gages with more than ten years of instantaneous data. We find that the flashiest basins in the contiguous United States are located in urban areas along a swath of states from the southern Midwest to the Mid-Atlantic as well as in mountainous regions along the west coast. We focus on small urban watersheds to identify the flashiest cities and states across the country. The USGS GAGESII dataset along with lightning data are used for hydrologic, hydraulic, land use and climate data to attempt to explain differences in flashiness across the watersheds. We focus particularly on the Illinois region to investigate how St. Louis is among the flashiest cities in the United Stated while Chicago is among the least flashy. Our flashiness map is compared with other measures of flooding such as flood damage and flash flood reports to see the impact of these frequent small flood events.",

            "abstract": "Isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (iGDGTs) are major archaeal lipids that widely occur in nature and have been used to study paleo-climate and paleo-environments. Estuaries are a dynamic ecosystem that links or divides terrestrial and marine processes. However, factors controlling changes in iGDGTs in estuaries are poorly known. In this study we performed monthly sampling of sediments between July 2012 and May 2013 at four sites from the lower Pearl River to the estuary. Total lipids were extracted to obtain core- and polar-GDGTs, which were identified and quantified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The average concentrations of archaeal lipids were highest at the seawater station (C-iGDGTs: 1804.0 ng/g; P-iGDGTs: 986.9 ng/g) and lowest at the brackish water station (C-iGDGTs: 364.1 ng/g; P-iGDGTs: 324.4 ng/g) with C-iGDGTs being more abundant than P-iGDGTs in most samples. The composition of iGDGTs varied widely from station to station, but was generally dominated by GDGT-0 or crenarchaeol in both C- and P-iGDGTs. At the freshwater station in the lower Pearl River, the relative abundance of C- and P-iGDGTs varied from month to month, whereas such temporal changes were much less at stations in the brackish and marine environments. These results suggest that Archaea living in freshwater might be more sensitive to environmental variation. A significant positive correlation (R2>0.80, p<0.01) was found between the ratio of Cren./(Cren.+GDGT-0) or ring index and salinity in both C- and P-iGDGT fractions, indicating that salinity is the most important factor affecting the composition of iGDGTs in the estuary environment.",

            "abstract": "Bottom Simulating Reflections (BSRs) are commonly thought to be caused by free gas at the base of gas hydrate stability (BGHS). BSRs usually occur at the pressure-temperature conditions for the phase boundary of gas hydrate, which depends on gas composition, pore water chemistry, and various other factors. Hence, BSRs should only occur at a single depth level beneath the seafloor. At several locations worldwide however, double and multiple BSRs have been observed. We have recently discovered localized double-BSRs on the Hikurangi Margin east of New Zealand and present first results from studying the possible origin of these double-BSRs.\nBoth BSRs display negative polarity compared to the seafloor ruling out diagenetic origins. The deeper BSR (BSR-2) is found to be anomalously deep, while the shallower BSR (BSR-1) is at similar depths as BSRs regionally. BSR-2 and BSR-1 are clearly separated on seismic lines from east to west, while they converge from north to south.\nWe propose two possible models for formation of these double-BSRs:\n1. Uplift leads to depressurization and an upward movement of the BGHS with respect to the seafloor. BSR-1 may have formed at the new BGHS while immobile gas may remain in place at the original level of the BGHS causing BSR-2.\n2. Thermogenic gas may leak from a deeper hydrocarbon reservoir. Gas mixes of thermogenic origin are predicted to form hydrate that is more stable than pure methane hydrate, in particular if the mix contains gases that lead to formation of Structure-II hydrate. BSR-2 may form at a level of the BGHS for a more stable gas mix; residual gases may migrate further until they reach the phase boundary for less stable hydrates at BSR-1.\nWe currently slightly favour uplift as cause of the double-BSRs largely because of the smooth topography of BSR-2: Small-scale lateral variations of gas composition should lead to significant BSR topography. More importantly, we note that the process of fractionation of gas during hydrate formation from thermogenic gas mixes in nature is only poorly understood.",

            "abstract": "Physical soil properties create lags between temperature change and corresponding soil responses, which obscure true Q10 values and other biophysical parameters such as depth of production. This study examines inversion approaches for estimating Q10 and depth of production using physically based soil models, constrained by observed high-frequency surface fluxes and/or concentrations. Our inversion strategy uses, at its base, a 1-D multi-layered soil model that simulates realistic temperature and gas diffusion physics. We tested inversion scenarios on synthetic datasets using a range of constraining parameters, time averaging techniques, mechanisms to improve computational efficiency, and various methods of incorporating real data into the model. Overall, we have found that with carefully constrained datasets, inversion was possible. While inversions using exclusively surface flux measurements could succeed, constraining the inversion using at least one shallow subsurface CO2 measurement proved to be most successful. Precision in modeling soil profile temperature was found to be crucial to the inversion process, along with the frequency of temperature measurements. This was not a surprise, given that temperature is the known determinant of soil lags. This presentation will share the various lessons from this work, and will illustrate these concepts using synthetic and real data. This work is a first step toward building a reliable framework for removing physical effects from high frequency soil CO2 datasets. Ultimately, we hope that this process will lead to better estimates of biophysical soil parameters and their variability on short timescales.",

            "abstract": "Synthesis of scientific data coming from individuals and small research group activities, known as long-tail data, with the existing resources elucidates useful scientific knowledge. In general, long-tail data are irreplaceable, expensive to reproduce, infrequently reused, follow no predefined data model, and they are often bounded in different information systems. The contextual relationships across the many attributes among such data in a data collection are herewith defined as data-network. These relationships have the potential to provide deep insights for the scientific challenges that require multidisciplinary interaction by identifying a new data object in the broader context of other data objects, and characterizing its spatial and temporal dependencies with others. Despite the advancement that has been achieved in various geoscience information models, it is not always straightforward to identify and characterize the contextual relationships among long-tail data because information models focus on profiling data attributes more than exploring data tie-ins. To address this need, we have designed the Long Tail Data Networks (LTDN) engine, which depends on a context-based approach to analyze the data attributes, predict data contextual relationships, and publish these relationships as a RDF graph. The engine groups data using their geographic location in spatial collections, and applies binary logic predicates to analyze the spatial, temporal, and variable attributes associated with data entities of each spatial collection to infer their relationships. Here we present the design of the LTDN engine and demonstrate its application for predicting the latent connectivity among long-tail data collections. To demonstrate the capabilities of the engine, we implemented this approach within the Sustainable Environment Actionable Data (SEAD) environment, an open-source semantic content repository that supports long-tail data curation and preservation, and show how relationships among datasets can be extracted. Results of this work demonstrates the capabilities of LTDN engine to predict the latent connectivity among long-tail geoscience data across their domain boundaries, as well as temporal and spatial windows to establish dynamic Web-based data-networks in the Semantic Web context.",

            "abstract": "Detecting trends in hydrometerological data via the commonly used Mann-Kendall test is challenged by the presence of autocorrelation component in the series. The positive autocorrelation inflates the probability of detecting trends when actually none exists. Trend-free Pre-whitening is one useful technique to eliminate this adverse effect of autocorrelation on the test. However, its applicability is offset by the sampling error of estimating linear trend slope in the series. Without removing the trend component, the Pre-whitening method reduces the power of the test to detect a significant trend. To remedy these weaknesses, a modified Trend-free Pre-whitening method is proposed via correcting the standard deviation of the detrended series and improving the estimation accuracy of linear trend slope. The modified method is further compared with the original one and the Pre-whitening method in simulation and application studies. The results validate the merit of the modified method. It not only reduces the probability of falsely reporting an inexistent trend but also preserves the power of detecting a strong trend. The modified method is recommended when the estimated linear trend slope is biased and unreliable.",

            "abstract": "With multiple sensors developed to monitor CO2 concentration from space, it is necessary to examine the coherency and discrepancy in different CO2 datasets for understanding their strengths and weaknesses and their overall spatio-temporal self-consistency. In this study, we examine column CO2 mixing ratios retrieved by three different satellite sensors, namely AIRS, SCIAMACHY and GOSAT (the ACOS algorithm). Data from two surface based observational networks, TCCON and GAW are used to validate the datasets and to test near surface sensitivity. The comparison is focused on large-scale features over land, such as trends and seasonality, which should be present in all datasets despite their different spectral sampling and altitude sensitivity. We use a newly developed spectral analysis technique – the Combined Maximum Covariance analysis (CMCA) to decompose the multi-dimensional datasets and to extract major modes of variability from different datasets combined. Results show that a global increase in XCO2 at ~2ppm/yr is found in all datasets. However, the spatial distribution of the trends are not consistent. All datasets except AIRS exhibit strong seasonal variability, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, while the AIRS seasonal cycle is much weaker. SCIAMACHY and ACOS also have good agreement with ground-based observations. ACOS is found to agree with TCCON the best, and SCIAMACHY has slightly higher near surface sensitivity. We plan to perform similar analysis and comparison using OCO-2 data and also for methane observations.\nFigure caption: The first two CMCA modes for AIRS, SCIAMACHY, ACOS and TCCON data. TCCON signals are superimposed as circles. The PCs have strong seasonal cylces and the correlation between satellite data and TCCON are very high (R values).

            "abstract": "Eutrophication has been one of the major threats to the coastal ecosystem. Several factors are believed to be associated with eutrophication, which including the high nutrient loads delivered into the estuary from river. Yangtze river is the longest river in China. It brings huge amount of nutrients into the Yangtze Estuary (YE) and adjacent East China Sea (ECS) and contributes significantly to the eutrophication in estuary and the adjacent waters. The eutrophication in this region exhibits strong seasonal variability, with the worst situation occurring in summer. This seasonal variability might be coupled with the timing of riverine nutrient inputs and physical processes (wind and along-shore current).\nTo study seasonal variability of nutrients (N/P) in YE, a 3D physical-biological coupled model was applied to the YE and its adjacent waters. The physical model was the Regional Ocean Model System (ROMS) and the biological model was a nitrogen, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and detritus (NPZD) model. The simulated nutrients distribution pattern was consistent with observation. With the numerical experiments, we examined nutrients transport under different river loads and different physical processes. Seasonal variability of nutrients budget in YE and alone-shelf transport flux were also studied.",

            "abstract": "The magnetospheric magnetic reconnection rate, RMR, is used to describe how fast magnetic reconnection proceeds on the dayside magnetopause. In literature, one of the proxies used for determining the reconnection rate is the plasma velocity in the reconnection inflow region, VIN, or, to be more accurate, the convective electric field parallel to the X line in the inflow region, E = VINBIN. On the magnetopause of the Earth, RMR divided by the rate at which solar wind flux is incident on the cross section of the magnetosphere can represent the input efficiency of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) into the Earth's magnetosphere. RMR on the magnetopause, however, is modified by local conditions such as the magnetic fields and plasma densities on both sides of the magnetopause. Thus RMR may vary with position on the magnetopause and the integral of RMR over the whole magnetopause is required to estimate the global efficiency of the input of IMF flux into the magnetosphere. We will present a new approach to establishing reconnection efficiency by comparing solar wind flux to measured magnetosheath flux carried in the flow near the terminator. We have conducted statistics on data collected by Cluster in the Earth's magnetosheath from 2001-2013. The global input efficiency of IMF flux into the magnetosphere is estimated and its relationship to the solar wind and IMF conditions is investigated in this presentation.",

            "abstract": "Recent work has found links between how a species’ phenology shifts with climate change and its changes in performance with climate change. Species that appear to ‘track’ climate change, for example North American temperate plant species that shift leafing or flowering earlier with warmer springs, also tend to increase in abundance or other metrics of plant performance, while the reverse is generally seen for species that delay phenology with warming. This correlation between phenological tracking and performance has been implicated in plant invasions and appears to be an important factor in predicting future plant populations and communities under climate change scenarios. We have, however, little theory on why--or why not--species may phenologically track the start of spring. Early-season phenology gives priority access to light and soil resources and thus, in a simplistic model where the start of season varies between years, all species should strongly track the start of season, yet communities are always a mix of phenological tracking strategies (from species that do not track the start of season to strong trackers).\nUsing a stochastic community assembly model we examined how phenological tracking influences species abundances across time under two different environmental scenarios: one with a stationary environment and one with a nonstationary environment where the start of season shifts earlier over time. Our model shows that trade-offs are required between phenological tracking and parameters related to species-specific resource use to maintain a community with a diversity of phenological tracking strategies and that nonstationary environments strongly favor species that track the start of season. Our results suggest that trade-offs established under a stationary climate that allow a diversity of phenological tracking strategies across species in a community may not hold under non-stationary environments to maintain the same diversity of species. Instead, nonstationary environments may lead to abundance increases in species that strongly track climate and thus may explain recent findings linking phenological tracking to performance.",

            "abstract": "Land subsidence is a common natural hazard occurring in extensive areas in the world. In Beijing, the capital city of China, there has been serious land subsidence due to overexploitation of ground water during the recent decades. Five major subsidence tunnels have formed. Across the Beijing plain area, the ground is sinking at the rate of 30-100mm/year. Uneven subsidence leads to ground fissure and building destruction, and has caused great economical and property loss. To better characterize and understand regional land subsidence evolution, it is critical to monitor the time-series dynamics of subsidence, and capture the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of the subsidence evolution. Interferometric SAR technique, as it provides high spatial resolution and wide range of observation, have been successfully used to monitor regional ground deformation.\nThe objective of this study is to derive time-series regional land subsidence dynamics in Beijing, and based on which, analyze and assess the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of the evolution using cluster analysis. First, ENVISAT ASAR (2003-2009 years, 28 scenes, track number: 218) datasets during 2003-2010 covering Beijing plain area were utilized to obtain time-series subsidence rate using Persistent Scatter InSAR (PS-InSAR) technique provided in SARProz software. Second, time-series subsidence characteristics of the PS points were analyzed and the PS points were clustered based on Self-Organization feature Maps (SOM) algorithm considering environmental factors such as groundwater level and lithologic characters.\nThis study demonstrates that based on InSAR measurements and SOMs algorithm, the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of land subsidence evolution can be captured. Each cluster shows unique spatial-temporal evolution pattern. The results of this study will facilitate further land subsidence modeling and prediction at regional spatial scale.",

            "abstract": "The mandate is clear for improving communication between models and experiments to better evaluate terrestrial responses to atmospheric and climatic change. Unfortunately, progress in linking experimental and modeling approaches has been slow and sometimes frustrating. Recent successes in linking results from the Duke and Oak Ridge free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments with ecosystem and land surface models – the FACE Model-Data Synthesis (FACE-MDS) project – came only after a period of slow progress, but the experience points the way to future model-experiment interactions.\nAs the FACE experiments were approaching their termination, the FACE research community made an explicit attempt to work together with the modeling community to synthesize and deliver experimental data to benchmark models and to use models to supply appropriate context for the experimental results. Initial problems that impeded progress were: measurement protocols were not consistent across different experiments; data were not well organized for model input; and parameterizing and spinning up models that were not designed for simulating a specific site was difficult. Once these problems were worked out, the FACE-MDS project has been very successful in using data from the Duke and ORNL FACE experiment to test critical assumptions in the models. The project showed, for example, that the stomatal conductance model most widely used in models was supported by experimental data, but models did not capture important responses such as increased leaf mass per unit area in elevated CO2, and did not appropriately represent foliar nitrogen allocation.\nWe now have an opportunity to learn from this experience. New FACE experiments that have recently been initiated, or are about to be initiated, include a eucalyptus forest in Australia; the AmazonFACE experiment in a primary, tropical forest in Brazil; and a mature oak woodland in England. Cross-site science questions are being developed that will have a strong modeling framework, and modelers and experimentalists will work to establish common measurement protocols and data format. By starting the model-experiment connection early and learning from our past experiences, we expect to significantly shorten the time lags between advances in process-oriented studies and large-scale models.",

            "abstract": "Extreme precipitation events along the U.S. West Coast can result in major damage and are projected by most climate models to increase in frequency and severity. One of the most prevalent extreme precipitation events that occurs along the west coast of North America are known as 'Atmospheric Rivers' (ARs), whereby extensive fluxes of water vapor are transported from the tropics and/or subtropics, delivering substantial precipitation and contributing to flooding when they encounter mountains. This region is particularly vulnerable to ARs, with 30-50% of annual precipitation in this region occurring from just a few AR events. Because of the tropical and/or subtropical origin of ARs, they can carry unique isotopic properties. Here we present the results of analysis of weekly precipitation data and accompanying isotopic values from Giant Forest, in Sequoia National Park, in the southwestern Sierra Nevada Mountains (36.57° N; 118.78° W; 1921m) from 2001 to 2011. To better characterize these events, we focused on the 10 weeks with the highest precipitation totals (all greater than 150 mm) during the study period. We show that nine of the top ten weeks contain documented 'AR' events and that 90% occurred during the negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation. A comparison of extreme precipitation events across the Western U.S. with several key climate indices demonstrate these events occur most frequently when the negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation is in sync with the negative phase of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the negative or neutral Pacific North American (PNA) pattern. We also demonstrate that central or eastern Pacific location of ENSO sea surface temperature anomalies can further enhance predictive capabilities of the landfall location of extreme precipitation. Stable isotope results show that extreme precipitation events are characterized by highly variable δ18O (-7.20‰ to -19.27‰), however, we find that more negative δ18O values typically occur during the negative PNA pattern. Finally, we will present the results of data comparison with NCAR-NCEP reanalysis, Hysplit back trajectories, and isotope enabled climate model (IsoGSM) results.",

            "abstract": "Ethane is an abundant hydrocarbon in the atmosphere and it is a precursor to tropospheric ozone formation. Ethane also impacts the atmosphere’s oxidative capacity through its reaction with OH, the primary loss pathway. Today, the primary sources of atmospheric ethane are from anthropogenic fossil fuel use, mainly from evaporative emissions associated with the production, processing and transmission of fossil fuels. Ethane also has significant emissions from biomass burning and biofuel use, and minor emissions from oceanic, biogenic, and possibly geologic sources. The mean annual atmospheric lifetime of ethane is about 2 months. Reconstructions from polar firn air and surface flask data show a significant rise in the global levels of atmospheric ethane during the twentieth century, followed by a peak and a decline from 1980-2010. However, to date, no ice core measurements of paleo-atmospheric ethane have been reported. A pre-industrial ethane record would provide information about the magnitude and natural variability of ethane from biomass-burning and geologic emissions and would contribute to our understanding of the variability in atmospheric methane over long timescales.\nIn this study, we discuss analytical methods for the extraction of ethane from polar ice cores. Ethane measurements were made in shallow, dry-drilled ice cores from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide and the South Pole, and in Greenland ice cores from the Greenland Ice Sheet Project. Samples were analyzed by both dry and wet extraction procedures, with analysis by high-resolution mass spectrometry with isotope dilution. The results from both methods will be compared. Preliminary estimates of pre-industrial ethane levels will be discussed, as well as the feasibility of reconstructing long-term records of atmospheric ethane.",

We have derived the necessary and sufficient condition for existence of magnetic flux-current surfaces in magnetohydrostatic equilibria. It is also shown that the existence of flux-current surfaces is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the ratio of gravity-aligned components of current density and magnetic field to be constant along each field line. However, its necessary and sufficient condition is found to be very restrictive.

However, weather reconnaissance aircraft data has observed warm-rings in intense hurricanes. A warm-ring structure results when the warmest temperature anomalies occur on the outer edge of the eye. Schubert et al. (2007) suggests the Eliassen transverse circulation equation can model intense hurricanes with a warm-core structure in the upper troposphere and also a warm-ring structure in the lower. Although the thermal wind equation was used in the derivation of the transverse circulation equation, the thermal wind equation has not been used explicitly in an attempt to create such a temperature field. This study derives the thermal wind equation from the hydrostatic and the gradient wind equations to analyze the temperature, tangential velocity, and the absolute vorticity fields. Using observed hurricanes, a warm-ring structure is simulated with the thermal wind equation as the basis. With a prescribed temperature profile, the calculated tangential velocity and absolute vorticity fields resemble those of a realistic hurricane. Thus, the thermal wind equation can be used to create a realistic, intense hurricane with a warm ring structure. Schubert et al. (2007) discusses subsidence as a mechanism that leads to the warm-ring but the tangential velocity and absolute vorticity fields suggest some influence of boundary layer processes that should be explored in future research for a further understanding of warm-rings.",

            "abstract": "Seasonal snow water equivalent (SWE) is important for an estimate of water storage in the hydrological cycle, prediction of snow disaster, water resources, and so on. Satellite observation technique is valuable but has the coarse footprint such as 25 km spacing generally. In this study, numerical simulation model is applied to estimate the SWE in the presence of spatial variability. To begin with, we examined validity of the SWE simulated by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Snow surveys in the Altai Mountain were carried out, and the in-situ snow data were manually collected during the maximum SWE season each year. We compared the SWE simulated by the WRF model (ver. 3.3) with that collected by the in-situ snow surveys in the Altai Mountains during four years (2008, 2011, 2012, and 2013). The results show that the agreement with in-situ snow survey data is good. Based on this, this presentation will also describe characteristics of the simulated SWE distribution in the Altai Mountains.",

            "abstract": "Lack of reliable, well-distributed, long-term datasets for model validation is a bottle-neck for most exercises in soil moisture analysis and prediction. Understanding what factors drive soil hydrological processes at different scales and their variability is very critical to further our ability to model the various components of the hydrologic cycle more accurately. For this, a comprehensive dataset with measurements across scales is very necessary. Intensive fine-resolution sampling of soil moisture over extended periods of time is financially and logistically prohibitive. Installation of a few long term monitoring stations is also expensive, and needs to be situated at critical locations. The concept of Time Stable Locations has been in use for some time now to find locations that reflect the mean values for the soil moisture across the watershed under all wetness conditions. However, the soil moisture variability across the watershed is lost when measuring at only time stable locations. We present here a study using techniques such as Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) and Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM) that extends the concept of time stable locations to arrive at locations that provide not simply the average soil moisture values for the watershed, but also those that can help re-capture the dynamics across all locations in the watershed. As with the time stability, the initial analysis is dependent on an intensive sampling history. The DMD/DEIM method is an application of model reduction techniques for non-linearly related measurements. Using this technique, we are able to determine the number of sampling points that would be required for a given accuracy of prediction across the watershed, and the location of those points. Locations with higher energetics in the basis domain are chosen first. We present case studies across watersheds in the US and India. The technique can be applied to other hydro-climates easily.",

            "abstract": "Global land surface models and Earth system models are computationally expensive and contain large numbers of uncertain parameters, limiting the feasibility of uncertainty quantification (UQ) studies that require model ensembles on a global scale. Fortunately, even relatively small model ensembles can yield useful information about key model parameter sensitivities. Knowledge about how parameter sensitivities vary across space, time and model outputs are of key importance to not only the modeling community, but also the measurement community as this knowledge can inform observation strategies targeted at reducing prediction uncertainty. Here we apply the Morris method, a basic but efficient way to perform a parameter sensitivity analysis, on 24 biogeophysical parameters in CLM, using 200 global offline 1.9x2.5 degree global simulations. Model output variables of interest are photosynthetic fluxes, energy fluxes, and hydrologic variables. We find that the ranking of parameter importance strongly depends on climate (e.g. mean annual temperature and precipitation). The parameterization of stomatal conductance is particularly important in most locations. We also evaluate the performance of the model ensemble against benchmark datasets for evapotranspiration and gross primary productivity. We then present results from a second ensemble of land-atmosphere coupled simulations, using the Community Earth System Model (CESM), investigating in particular the sensitivity of land-atmosphere feedbacks to 5 key CLM biogeophysical parameters.",

            "abstract": "Information on the uncertainties in projections of future climate change is vital for their effective use across a wide range of applications. A multi-thousand member perturbed-physics ensemble of global climate model simulations is being used to better estimate model uncertainties in climate change projections for the globe and North America. Ensemble members have been generated by the distributed computing project climateprediction.net at the University of Oxford, where thousands of simulations have been run on PCs across the globe, each running a different version of the Hadley Centre HadCM3L coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (CMIP3 version) with perturbed physics parameters. Results from this perturbed physics ensemble will be compared to results from the CMIP3 and CMIP5 multi-model ensembles for global and North American regional temperature and precipitation variability and change across the 20th and 21st centuries. It will be shown that the uncertainty in the perturbed physics ensemble can exceed that of the multi-model ensemble.   \nThe HadCM3L model has horizontal resolution of 2.5° latitude by 3.75° longitude with 19 vertical layers in the atmosphere and 20 vertical layers in the ocean. A 30 minute dynamical integration time step is used with physics parameterization run every 3 hours. Transient climate change simulations are available from 1921 to 2080 along with matching control simulations that use flux adjustments to maintain stable climates. For the period 1921 to 2000, the model is forced by observed changes in both anthropogenic and natural climate forcing factors, including changes in greenhouse gases and aerosols, and changes in solar irradiance and volcanic aerosols. For the period 2001 to 2080, the model is forced by a range of future solar and volcanic forcing scenarios as well as projected changes in anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols according to the IPCC SRES A1B emission scenario, a mid-range scenario. Model physics parameters are varied within their current range of uncertainty for each forcing scenario, providing an ensemble of more than 1,700 transient and 1,200 control simulations.",

            "abstract": "The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a key mechanism in basin-scale northward heat transport and thus plays an important role for global climate. In the North Atlantic, warmer water from the subequatorial region is transported northward in the upper layers of the ocean, and after cooling at higher latitudes, the water sinks down and is transported back southward. This process has important influence on the climate regime in the Earth’s northern hemisphere, in particular in Northwestern Europe.\nCoherence between ocean bottom pressure (OBP) and the AMOC has been characterized in theoretical and simulation studies. Here, we use output from two ocean state estimates, ECCO2 and GECCO2. We use the model data to (1) evaluate to what extent space-based observations of time-variable gravity and the inversion for ocean bottom pressure can be used to observe AMOC variability, and (2) to test algorithms to extract the AMOC signal from GRACE-like OBP observations.\nIn both ocean state estimates we find a strong correlation between the AMOC signal and local OBP variations, and we are able to reconstruct AMOC variations from OBP anomalies at the model’s resolution. In a next step, the ECCO2 and GECCO2 outputs are smoothed and filtered so that the OBP data resemble the spatial resolution of GRACE gravity solutions.\nWhile the AMOC at GRACE resolution introduces errors due to the decreased spatial sensitivity, first results show that inter-annual AMOC variations can be recovered from GRACE-like OBP observations at some latitudes (e.g., at 28N for the upper ocean transport). At other latitudes, signal leakage can introduce significant errors in the AMOC reconstruction. Finally, the techniques are employed to derive the AMOC signal from recent GRACE OBP solutions.",

            "abstract": "Balsam woolly adelgid (BWA) is a nonnative invasive forest insect introduced from Europe to North America around 1900. The insect established and spread in the northeast, infesting and causing mortality of balsam fir and has since established infestations in all true firs in eastern and western North America. There are several indicators of the presence and severity of BWA, and mortality can occur rapidly or trees may persist for many decades depending on the type and intensity of infestation. Severity ratings to describe damage have largely been based on a system developed for balsam fir in Newfoundland. Modifications to this system, also developed in eastern North America, used similar characteristics, but reduced the number of classes using qualitative damage assessments. Quantitative rating systems have been developed in the western United States, however much of the research in the Pacific Northwest is based on long-term monitoring studies that describe damage patterns for host species and quantify mortality rates. Results are inconsistent geographically and between tree species, and do not incorporate stand-specific information with individual tree ratings. This emphasizes the need for a species-specific, stand-level rating system, particularly in the west where the insect is expanding its range into novel habitat, likely as a result of climatic changes. We developed a new, more comprehensive rating system for grand fir and subalpine fir in the northwest US that combines all the symptoms of BWA-related tree damage with stand-level information about species composition and structure. Our scale identifies differences between each species and quantitatively differentiates between damage classes, identifying the symptoms defining each class. This rating system allows for more efficient classification of stand-level risk for BWA and will be used to develop a predictive risk model that identifies factors that can assist land managers with damage mitigation strategies.",

We have confirmed the engineering performance at system level of the interferometer demonstrating that it measures across-track surface slopes with a precision of 25 micro-radians and an accuracy of 10 micro-radians, greatly exceeding the pre-launch specifications (100 micro-radians). Over the polar ice sheets, we have examined the performance of the range estimation, and determined the range precision to be 19 cm RMS at 20 Hz. We have examined the retrieval of the phase information over the ice sheets, and found the phase estimates to be robust and little affected by the uncertain ice sheet topography. Based on the calibration of the interferometer, the contribution of the across track slope error is, at 0.4 mm, negligible. Over marine sea ice, we have verified the discrimination of sea ice and ocean lead returns using contemporaneous SAR imagery from ENVISAT, and we have estimated the precision of individual (20 Hz) measurements to be 2 cm. In summary, with the corrected data products, we are able to confirm that the system performance of CryoSat-2 will meet or exceed its specification over the continental and marine ice sheets.\nThis presenetation sumamrises the key outcomes of the mission performance, and presents a series of example case studies where CryoSat-2 data have been applied to study changes in Earth's land and sea ice cover. We show that in 4 years CryoSat has been able to detect changes in the mass of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets with an accuracy comparable to that of the past 20 years of conventional satellite altimetry and that important changes have occured in these regions, we show that CryoSat has been able to quantify changes in the volume of sea ice across the entire northern hemisphere for the first time and that unexpected changes have occurred, and we show that the mission has been able to detect changes in the volume of rugged, glaciated terrain, that were beyond the capability of past altiemter missions and that are in places extreme in comparison to past observations.",

            "abstract": "We investigated how the moisture supply from the Kuroshio Current/Kuroshio Extension affects the rapid intensification of an explosive cyclone using a couple atmosphere-ocean non-hydrostatic model, CReSS-NHOES. The Cloud-Resolving Storm Simulator (CReSS) and the Non-Hydrostatic Ocean model for the Earth Simulator (NHOES) have been developed by the Hydrospheric Atmospheric Research Center of Nagoya University and the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, respectively. We performed a numerical simulation of an extratropical cyclone migrating along the southern periphery of the Kuroshio Current on January 14, 2013, that developed most rapidly in recent years in the vicinity of Japan. The evolutions of surface fronts related to the cyclone simulated by the CReSS-NHOES closely resemble Shapiro-Keyser model. In the lower troposphere, the cyclone’s bent-back front and the associated frontal T-bone structure become evident with the cyclone development. Cold Conveyor Belt (CCB) is also well organized over the northern part of the cyclone. During its developing stage, since the CCB dominates just over the Kuroshio Current/Kuroshio Extension, a large amount of moisture is efficiently supplied from the warm current into the CCB. The vapor evaporated from the underlying warm current is transported into the bent-back front by the CCB and converges horizontally in the vicinity of the front. As a result, strong diabatic heating arises over the corresponding moisture convergence area in that vicinity, indicating that the abundant moisture due to the warm current plays a vital role in rapid development of the cyclone through latent heat release processes. Both processes of the moisture transport from the warm current into the cyclone system via the CCB and of the latent heat release around the bent-back front are also confirmed by trajectory analyses. The rapid SLP decrease of the cyclone center can in turn increase the moisture supply from the warm current through enhancement of the CCB. We anticipate that such a feedback process plays a key role in the rapid intensification of the cyclone highlighted in this study.",

            "abstract": "Stable Sr isotopic compositions (δ88/86Sr) in marine carbonates potentially provide key information on paleoseawater temperature (Rüggeberg et al. 2008). Traditional methods for δ88/86Sr determination by 87Sr-84Sr double-spike TIMS or MC-ICP-MS require chemical purification of Sr before spectrometric measurements because of matrix effects. Recent studies suggested that the matrix-matching method, in which matrix-matched standard solutions were used to bracket untreated water samples, gave precise and accurate results for sulfur isotopic ratios by MC-ICP-MS (Lin et al., 2014). The obvious advantage of this method is that there is no need for chemical purification, thus eliminating the possibility of isotope fractionation during the ion chromatography and expediting sample throughput. In this study, we applied the matrix-matching method to δ88/86Sr determination by MC-ICP-MS. NIST 987 Sr solution and a purified seawater sample (collected from the South China Sea) were selected for this study. Given that major matrices in carbonate come form Ca2+, NIST 987 and SW solutions containing 40 ppm Ca2+ were prepared by adding high-purity Ca solution. All solutions used contained 200 ppb Sr and the 88Sr/86Sr ratios were measured using a Neptune MC-ICP-MS. The purified SW was first determined using SSB method, in which pure NIST 987 was used as standard to bracket SW and yielded δ88/86Sr value of 0.366 ± 0.008‰ (2SE, n = 10). The δ88/86Sr values of Ca-bearing SW were then measured by using pure NIST 987 solution as the working standard to investigate matrix effects. The determined δ88/86Sr value (0.039 ± 0.021‰; 2SE, n = 10) deviated obviously from the reference value. Finally, the matrix-matched NIST 987 was applied as the working standard to bracket the Ca-bearing SW, and the measured δ88/86Sr value is 0.351 ± 0.009‰ (2SE, n = 10), consistent with the reference value within uncertainties. The consistent δ88/86Sr values and comparable external precision suggested that the matrix-matching method is applicable to δ88/86Sr determination when Ca2+ is the major matrix inference. However, its application to natural carbonate samples with more complicated matrices needs further exploration. [1] Lin et al. 2014, Rapid Commun. Mass. Sp. [2] Rüggeberg et al. 2008. Earth. Planet.

            "abstract": "The tropical belt has widened by several degrees latitude since 1979, as evidenced by shifts in atmospheric circulation and climate zones. Global climate models also simulate tropical belt widening, but less so than observed. Reasons for this discrepancy and the mechanisms driving the expansion are uncertain. Here we analyse multidecadal variability in tropical belt width since 1950 using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 climate model runs and find that simulated rates of tropical expansion over the past 30 years—particularly in the Northern Hemisphere—are in better agreement with observations than previous models. We find that models driven by observed sea surface temperatures over this interval yield the largest rate of tropical expansion. We link the tropical expansion in the Northern Hemisphere to the leading pattern of sea surface temperature variability in the North Pacific, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. We also find, both from models and observations, that the tropical belt contracted in the Northern Hemisphere from 1950 to 1979, coincident with the reversal of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation trend. In both time periods, anthropogenic aerosols act to modify the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and therefore contribute to the width of the tropical belt. We conclude that tropical expansion and contraction are influenced by multidecadal sea surface temperature variability associated with both the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and anthropogenic aerosols.",

            "abstract": "Recent high-resolution tremor catalogs exhibit many enigmatic features related to rapid secondary fronts arising at or behind the main, slower tremor front. These include: “Rapid tremor reversals” that progress from km-scale affairs occurring too frequently to be tidally modulated to large (10’s of km) events that clearly are tidally modulated; relatively narrow tremor “streaks” that most often follow the main tremor front, even when that front is curved; other narrow streaks that propagate a few km behind the main front; and a tremor reversal that is spawned when two streaks propagating along the main front (nearly) collide. Most “reversals” differ from most “streaks” in that the reversals, propagating mostly along strike, typically have a resolvable down-dip extent, while the streaks, propagating mostly along dip, typically do not have a resolvable along strike extent. However, some “streaks” propagating along-dip at the main front appear to have a resolvable along-strike extent; these, and the streaks that arise behind the main front, seem to argue against the streaks’ rapid velocity resulting simply from the main front intersecting a linear array of tremor sources.\nThe above observations, tremor amplitude trends, and the widths of propagating tremor fronts are all potential constraints on the constitutive law for slow slip. Some of these observations were reproduced by an ad-hoc two-state-variable friction law [Rubin, 2011]; some appear to have been reproduced more naturally by heterogeneous single-state variable simulations [Luo and Ampuero, AGU 2011; 2012]; some were reproduced by the simplified rate-state simulations of Collela et al. [2012]. Given the complexity of these models and the underling equations, we report here on the results of models in which a single tremor source perturbs an otherwise homogenous slow slip front propagating along a 1-D or 2-D rate-state-friction fault. The hope is that these toy models will ultimately help us to distinguish between proposed constitutive laws for slow slip.",

            "abstract": "The motivation for this project was simple: to reduce raw data from the Ultraviolet Spectrometers on both Voyager Spacecraft to verify the results of a simulation of Lyman-alpha radiative transfer within a 3D MHD kinetic-neutral model of the heliosphere created at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. The heliospheric model, which self-consistently includes the interaction between ionized and neutral hydrogen, outputs a density map of neutral hydrogen. The Monte Carlo radiative transfer model then simulates the propagation and scattering of millions of photons through this density map and outputs the relative number of photons that should be seen by spacecraft at any point within 1000 AU of the sun. My project was to learn how to analyze the raw Voyager data and compare it to these simulations.\nThere were several stages of analysis necessary to reduce to useful data. Records containing signals from sources other than the interplanetary medium, such as stars and planets, were discarded. The remaining records were averaged along regional lines of sight to achieve better signal to noise. The spectra were then corrected for inherent device flaws, such as channel-to-channel variations in sensitivity (fixed-pattern noise), dark counts due to the radioisotope thermal electric generator, and imperfections in the scattering of the diffraction grating. Records were then sorted and averaged to create a full-sky map consisting of 18 regions for each specified radial bin to match the cell spacing of the radiative transfer model. The results were then normalized to solar minimum to reduce variations in the data due to solar cycle oscillations.\nInitial results indicate an unexpected deviation from the models, but more analysis must be performed to determine if the discrepancy comes from the normalization of the data, insufficient angular resolution of the radiative transfer model, or the physics of the models themselves. Future work involves increasing the resolution of the radiative transfer model and the number of sky regions to try to resolve smaller scale features of the heliosphere.",

We present measurements of waves, currents, and turbulence from SWIFT drifters at the Columbia River Mouth to diagnose wave transformation, breaking, and the resulting turbulence. In particular, down-looking velocity profiles, measured onboard the drifters, allow for evaluation of wave transformation on a vertically sheared current, for which theory exists but few in situ measurements are available. One consequence of wave transformation is steepening and breaking, which is identified using visual images, increased near surface turbulence, and gradients in wave energy flux. Vertical turbulent dissipation profiles measured during breaking are compared to existing scalings developed for deep and shallow water and expanded to the intermediate depth conditions common at the Columbia River Mouth. The analysis is intended to improve hydrodynamic models, especially two-way coupled wave-current models, and to aid navigation by better predicting dangerous wave conditions.",

            "abstract": "Shortly after the climactic eruption of ~600 km3 of Bishop Tuff zoned rhyolitic magma, ~100 km3 of crystal-poor Early Rhyolite erupted inside Long Valley Caldera between ~750-650 ka as domes, glassy lavas, and tuffs (Hildreth, 2004). Despite similarities in bulk composition (e.g., 73-75 wt% SiO2; ~100 ppm Sr), there are marked differences between the Late (≥ 790°C) Bishop Tuff and postcaldera Early Rhyolites. Although crystal-poor (<5%), the Early Rhyolites are often saturated with 7-8 mineral phases (plag + opx + ilm + tmte + biotite + apatite + zircon ± pyrrhotite), but without the quartz, sanidine, and cpx additionally found in the more crystal-rich (12-24%) Late Bishop Tuff. Pre-eruptive temperatures, on the basis of two Fe-Ti oxides, range from 720-860°C, and ∆NNO values range from-0.4 to -0.9 (consistent with abundant ilmenite). Thus the Early Rhyolites record fO2 values that are nearly two orders of magnitude lower than those in the Late Bishop Tuff (∆NNO = +1; Hildreth and Wilson, 2007). Application of the plagioclase-liquid hygrometer to Early Rhyolites gives pre-eruptive water contents ≤ 4.4 wt% H2O. The phenocrysts in Early Rhyolite obsidians often display euhedral and/or diffusion-limited growth textures, suggesting degassing-induced crystallization during rapid ascent. Isotopic data from the literature (e.g., Simon et al., 2014 and references therein) show that Long Valley rhyolites were derived from both crustal and mantle sources. We hypothesize that the drop in fO2 between the Late Bishop Tuff and Early Rhyolites may reflect a transition in their respective mantle source, from subduction-modified lithosphere to asthenosphere. Such a time-progressive transition in the mantle source of erupted basalts is seen throughout the Great Basin, occurring earliest in its central region and more recently toward its western margin (e.g. Cousens et al., 2012). Although the geochemistry of Quaternary basalts erupted around Long Valley indicate a subduction-modified lithosphere source (Cousens, 1996), the Early Rhyolites may be recording the crustal emplacement of basalts from the asthenosphere before any have yet erupted. If so, the Early Rhyolites may be derived from a greater proportion of crustal sources than calculated from isotopic data on the assumption of a lithospheric mantle source.",

Initial data reduction has shown two recurring non-connecting aerosol layers between 50 and 500 m. Changes in the vertical profiles of relative humidity, and potential temperature collected from the NASA P-3 Aircraft were correlated with these recurring layers identified by the CL31. Aerosol backscatter profiles from the High Spectral Resolution LIDAR (HSRL) aboard the NASA King Air Aircraft also indicate the presence of multiple near surface layers. While the planetary boundary layer (PBL) heights inferred from the P-3 aircraft profiles generally agreed with the CL31 LIDAR measurements, the initial PBL heights retrieved from the NASA HSRL Galveston Island over flights did not agree with the CL31 ground LIDAR measurements. However, preliminary unprocessed aerosol backscatter data displayed aerosol layers, which appear to match the two layers seen by the Galveston CL31 LIDAR. Variations in the vertical profiles of VOC trace gases, as measured by the P-3 airborne PTR-MS, also confirmed the presence of the two layers observed by the CL31 at Galveston. Further data analysis aims to determine the significance of these aerosol backscatter signals and their correlation to the PBL.",

            "abstract": "Current sea ice observations and models indicate a transition towards a more seasonal Arctic ice pack with a smaller, and geographically more variable, multiyear ice component. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the processes governing this transition it is important to include the impact of the snow cover, determining the mechanisms by which snow is both responding to and forcing changes to the sea ice pack.\nData from NASA’s Operation IceBridge (OIB) snow radar system, which has been making yearly surveys of the western Arctic since 2009, offers a key resource for investigating the snow cover. In this work, we characterize the OIB snow radar instrument response to ascertain the location of ‘side-lobes’, aiding the interpretation of snow radar data. We apply novel wavelet-based techniques to identify the primary reflecting interfaces within the snow pack from which snow depth estimates are derived. We apply these techniques to the range of available snow radar data collected over the last 6 years during the NASA OIB mission. Our results are validated through comparison with a range of in-situ data. We discuss the impact of sea ice surface morphology on snow radar returns (with respect to ice type) and the topographic conditions over which accurate snow-radar-derived snow depths may be obtained. Finally we present improvements to in situ survey design that will allow for both an improved sampling of the snow radar footprint and more accurate assessment of the uncertainties in radar-derived snow depths in the future.",

            "abstract": "Antarctic sea ice increased over the past decades. This increase is the result of an increase in the Ross Sea (RS) and along the coast of East Antarctica, whereas the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas (ABS) and the Antarctic Peninsula has seen a general decline. Several mechanisms have been suggested as drivers for the regional, complex sea ice pattern, which include changes in ocean currents, wind pattern, as well as ocean and atmospheric temperature.\nAs part of the Roosevelt Island Climate Evolution (RICE) project, a 763 m deep ice core was retrieved from Roosevelt Island (RI; W161° 21’, S79°41’, 560 m a.s.l.), West Antarctica. The new record provides a unique opportunity to investigate mechanism driving sea ice variability in the RS and ABS sectors. Here we present the water stable isotope record (δD) from the upper part of the RICE core 0-40 m, spanning the time period from 1894 to 2011 (Fig. 1a).\nAnnual δD are correlated with Sea Ice Concentration (SIC). A significant negative (r= -0.45, p≤ 0.05) correlation was found between annual δD and SIC in the eastern RS sector (boxed region in Fig. 1b) for the following months NDJFMA (austral summer and fall). During NDJFMA, RI receives local moisture input from the RS, while during the rest of the year a large extent of this local moisture source area will be covered with sea ice with the exception of the RS Polynya. Concurrently, we observe positive δD and SIC correlations in the ABS, showing a dipole pattern with the eastern RS. For this reason, we suggest that the RICE δD might be used as a proxy for past SIC for the RS and ABS region.\nThere is no overall trend in δD over 100 years (r= -0.08 ‰ dec-1, p= 0.81, 1894-2011). However, we observe a strong increase from 2000-2011 of 17.7 ‰ dec-1(p≤ 0.1), yet the recent δD values and trend of the last decade are not unprecedented (Fig. 1a). We investigate changes in sea surface temperature, atmospheric temperature, inferred surface ocean currents and atmospheric wind fields to determine the driving mechanisms over the observational period (1979-2011).\nFigure 1. a) Annual δD RI record 1894-2011 (black dots) and δD decadal running mean (blue line). b) Correlation plot between δD and six-months (NDJFMA) seasonal SIC means between 1980- 2011.

            "abstract": "We investigate crustal and upper mantle phase velocity structures beneath NorthEastern China (NEC, 40°-54°N, 112°-135°E), a tectonically active region with continental volcanicity divided by active faults.\nRayleigh wave phase velocity is obtained respectively by Ambient Noise Method (ANM, Lin et al., GJI, 2009), Two Station Method (TSM, Meier et al., GJI, 2004) and Two Plane Wave Method (TPWM, Yang and Forsyth, JGR, 2005), assuring good frequency coverage. Two-year’ events with magnitude Ms>5.5 and epicentral distance Δ>30°recorded by NECESSArray and some permanent stations of CEA are together used in TPWM and TSM, while 1 s continuous seismic observations in the same period are employed in ANM. The period of Rayleigh wave phase velocity spans from 6 s to 150 s, i.e., from 6 s to 30 s (ANM); 30 s to 100 s (TPWM) and 30 s to 150 s (TSM). Shear wave velocity structure of the research region is obtained by Weighted Least Squares Inversion, in which the weight is adopted as function of data quality.\nOur results not only display close relation with tectonics of this region, such as mountains, sedimentary basins, faults, but also reveal variation feature of crustal thickness. Moreover, our results clearly show that all volcanos in this region have their roots — low velocity zones, among them the roots of Changbai, Jingbohu, Wudalianchi are obviously connected, while the biggest one of Daxinganling is separated. This feature might be result of an early intense eruption in western NEC and a late weak one in eastern NEC.",

            "abstract": "Remote sensing of precipitation in mountainous and snow-fed basins is challenging, but critical for hydrometeorological applications and water resources management. This study is part of the ongoing effort to develop a Regional Hydrological Extremes Assessment System (RHEAS). Five commonly used satellite-based high-resolution precipitation products (HRPPs) over several basins in the mountainous western United States are investigated. The products (TRMM 3B42, TRMM 3B42-RT, CMORPH, PERSIANN, and PERSIANN-CCS) are analyzed using ground gauge and gauge-adjusted radar precipitation data. In order to diagnose the sources of errors, level 2 products are also explored (AMSR, AMSU, TRMM TMI, TRMM PR, and CloudSat). CloudSat provided useful insight on light rain and snowfall and was used as an additional resource to improve the analysis. For hydrologic assessment, the skill of HRPPs and the resulting streamflow simulations from the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model is cross-compared. It was found that over the mountainous west US basins, HRPPs often capture major precipitation events, but seldom capture the observed magnitude of precipitation, especially during winter when snowfall is dominant. Bias adjustment is found to be effective in enhancing the HRPPs and resulting streamflow simulations. The results using collocated AMSR-E, CloudSat, and AMSU suggest that current limitations in retrieving snowfall, precipitation from systems that lack frozen hydrometeors, and systems over frozen land contribute largely to the observed errors transferred to HRPPs. In light of the operation of the GPM mission, further opportunities for enhancing snowfall retrieval and hydrology of cold and mountainous regions are becoming available. We provide some initial assessment of the latest GPM observations and discuss about the impact of GPM over cold-mountainous basins.",

            "abstract": "Crop productivity (yield) is sensitive to climate variability and change. To inform stakeholders, including food agencies in food-importing countries, about future variations in food supply associated with climate variability and change, understanding major climatic drivers of the spatiotemporal variations in crop yield over global cropland during the last few decades is crucial. Although remote sensing has difficulty distinguishing individual crops and misses entire cropping cycles in areas where extensive cloud cover during the monsoon limits satellite observations, it is still useful in deriving a proxy of crop yield over large spatial domain and estimating the impacts on crop yield proxy due to climate, including land-surface temperature and surface-layer soil moisture. This study presents an attempt to globally depict the impact of climate change on crop yield proxy by applying a time series analysis to MODIS and AMSR-E satellite images. The crop yield proxy used was the annual maximum or integrated MODIS-derived NDVI during the growing period predefined on the basis of the global crop calendar. The trends in the crop yield proxy in the interval 2001–2013 appeared positive in higher latitudes and negative in lower latitudes. In higher latitudes (and thus colder regions), the increased land-surface temperature led to an increase in crop yield in part due to the enhanced photosynthesis rate. In contrast, the crop yield proxy showed negative correlation with land-surface temperature in lower latitudes. The increased temperature might decrease crop yield by increasing evapotranspiration rate, plant respiration and/or heat stress. The crop yield proxy was also correlated with the AMSR-E-derived soil moisture, although the geographical distribution of soil moisture was highly heterogeneous.",

            "abstract": "Changes in local climatology are likely driving changes in local air-quality, both in terms of mean pollutant levels as well as the frequencies and magnitudes of extreme events. While the impact of changing meteorology on O3 and PM2.5 has been explored previously, much of the existing literature has focused on averages and linear regressions, statistical techniques that largely ignore extreme behavior and tail dependence. Since current air-quality standards often include limits on high quantiles of pollutant level observations (e.g. annual 4th highest daily maximum 8-hour concentration of O3 and 98th percentile of PM2.5 in the United States), statistical analyses that do not focus on tail dependence will be unable to fully evaluate impacts on exceedance frequencies. Using methodologies based on quantile regression (QR) and extreme value theory (EVT), tools specifically developed for the analysis of heavy-tailed phenomena, we analyze relationships between meteorology and extreme pollution episodes in the United States, both in the observed data record and in modeled output generated by the Community Earth System Model (CESM). Through this analysis, we propose a statistical framework for the identification of the meteorological drivers of these air-quality extremes, the evaluation of modeled extremes, and the improvement of future extreme projections based on observed sensitivities and assumed climatological changes.",

            "abstract": "Hydrologic connectivity of headwater catchments affects surface water yield and quality of downstream drinking water supplies. Lower Gordon Gulch, a 2.75 km2 catchment, is part of the Boulder Creek watershed – the primary drinking water supply for the city of Boulder, Colorado. We hypothesize that the geologic and climatic environment within the catchment controls the magnitude, timing, and duration of hydrologic connection between the landscape and the stream, and thus the distribution of major ions to the surface water. Specifically, bedrock patterns, vegetation type and density, and snowpack dynamics influence how precipitation inputs move from the hillslopes to the catchment outlet. Preliminary results suggest that north-facing hillslopes with steeper slopes, deeper weathering of bedrock, denser vegetation stands, and a seasonal snowpack, provide consistently greater groundwater inputs to the stream compared to the south-facing hillslopes. We believe that this is in part due to subsurface bedrock patterns forcing a dominate cross-valley gradient. Through an extensive observation network of hillslope wells, periodic stream water balance measurements, and synoptic chemistry samples, we plan to continue our assessment of the spatio-temporal connectivity dynamics throughout the seasonal dry down (late summer through winter), during which streamflow can be intermittent. Results will help to guide landuse practices of upland catchments with respect to their role in Boulder’s drinking water supply.",

Strong type III bursts observed by the Learmonth radio spectrograph and imaged by the MurchisonWidefield Array (MWA) are demonstrated to be in very good temporal and spatial coincidence with specic SDO magnetic reconnection events and with bursts of nonthermal 3-35 keV X-rays observed by the RHESSI spacecraft. The reconnection sites are low, near heights of 5-10 Mm or 0.01 solar radii, alleviating the number problem for producing the energetic electrons and X-rays. These data, especially the images and event timings, provide direct evidence for the long-unproven but standard model for type III bursts: semi-relativistic electrons energized in magnetic reconnection regions produce radio emission as they move away from the Sun and X-rays as they move into the chromosphere. Since not all SDO events produce X-ray or type III events, different special conditions must exist for the production of strong radio, X-ray, or UV bursts by reconnection events. These conditions are both on the production of suitable energetic electrons and on the production of observable radio, X-ray, and UV emissions from these electrons.",

            "abstract": "Most biogeochemical studies in forests have concentrated on nutrient pools and transformations occurring at relatively large spatial scales (i.e., stand or small catchment), over monthly or annual time scales. Many of these studies have also focused on the average or medial values observed across the spatial or temporal scale studied, discounting outliers. However, extremely high values found consistently (hot spot) or infrequently (hot moment) at a given soil microsite may be critical for nutrient acquisition by organisms and nutrient retention by terrestrial ecosystems. We have been evaluating soil nutrient hot-spot and hot-moment phenomena vertically (to a 60-cm depth) and horizontally (2-m sampling interval within a 6 m x 6 m grid) in two areas within a mixed-conifer, Sierran forest experiencing a Mediterranean-type climate. Nutrient fluxes in space and time were measured using ion exchange resin capsules placed at various depths and collected at two times (first significant precipitation in fall and post-snowmelt in spring) per year. Our previous work over a single year showed that fluxes of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in mineral soil were substantially greater in the spring (post-snowmelt) than in the fall, suggesting that soil water was a major factor in controlling these nutrient fluxes. The opposite pattern was found for NH4+ and Na+, where greater fluxes occurred following the first precipitation event in fall. Here, we report new data over two additional years at these same sites that allow us to better delineate between nutrient hot spots and hot moments. Overall, our results suggest that microbial-mediated nutrients (e.g., NH4+, NO3-, and PO43-) occur frequently as both hot spots and hot moments within soil, while those that are more abiotically controlled (e.g., Ca2+, Mg2+, and Na+) occur predominately as hot spots. Further elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for nutrient hot spot-hot moment phenomena within soil should be invaluable for improving the predictive capacity of biogeochemical models and for scaling these models across space and time.",

            "abstract": "Oxygen exists in lunar materials in distinct phases having unique sources and equilibration histories. The oxygen isotopic composition (δ17O, δ18O) of various components of lunar materials has been studied extensively, but analyses of water in these samples are relatively sparse [1-3]. Samples collected on the lunar surface reflect not only the composition of their source reservoirs but also contributions from asteroidal and cometary impacts, interactions with solar wind and cosmic radiation, among other surface processes. Isotopic characterization of oxygen in lunar water could help resolve the major source of water in the Earth-Moon system by revealing if lunar water is primordial, asteroidal, or cometary in origin [1].\nMethods: A lunar rock/soil sample is pumped to high vacuum to remove physisorbed water before heating step-wise to 50, 150, and 1000°C to extract extraterrestrial water without terrestrial contamination. The temperature at which water is evolved is proportional to the strength with which the water is bound in the sample and the relative difficulty of exchanging oxygen atoms in that water. This allows for the isolated extraction of water bound in different phases, which could have different source reservoirs and/or histories, as evidenced by the mass (in)dependence of oxygen compositions. A low blank procedure was developed to accommodate the low water content of lunar material [4].\nResults: Oxygen isotopic analyses of lunar water extracted by stepwise heating lunar basalts and breccias with a range of compositions, petrologic types, and surface exposure ages will be presented. The cosmic ray exposure age of these samples varies by two orders of magnitude, and we will consider this in discussing the effects of solar wind and cosmic radiation on the oxygen isotopic composition (Δ17O). I will examine the implications of our water analyses for the composition of the oxygen-bearing reservoir from which that water formed, the effects of surface processing on the isotopic composition of that water, and potential exogenous sources of water on the Moon.\n",

            "abstract": "Reactions in fog and cloud drops are important for a number of processes, such as formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA), cycling of organic carbon and nitrogen, and determining the lifetimes of pollutants. The rates of these processes depend upon the steady-state concentrations of the major photooxidants, namely, hydroxyl radical (.OH), singlet molecular oxygen (1O2*) and triplet excited states of organic compounds (3C*). While there are some past measurements of .OH and 1O2* concentrations in fog and cloud drops, there are no data for the concentrations of triplet excited states. However, there is increasing evidence that triplets might be important for the processing of organics in a cloudy or foggy atmosphere.\nTo address this question, we collected fog water samples from Davis, CA and Baton Rouge, LA, illuminated them with simulated sunlight, and measured the steady-state concentrations of .OH , 1O2* and 3C* . To understand the relative importance of these photooxidants, we also measured the photochemical loss of two added model organic compounds in the illuminated fog waters - syringol (a biomass burning phenol) and methyl jasmonate (a green leaf volatile). Our results show that triplet excited states can play a major role in oxidizing the model compounds, typically accounting for 30 – 90% of the loss of both model compounds. Given that atmospheric triplets are relatively less understood, our results highlight the importance of deeper investigation into their nature.",

Routing scheme is among the most important components of a hydrologic model. In this study, we replace the lumped LRR (linear reservoir routing) scheme used in previous versions of the distributed hydrological model, CREST (coupled routing and excess storage) by a newly proposed distributed LRR method, which is theoretically more suitable for distributed hydrological models. Consequently, we have effectively solved the problems of: 1) low values of channel flow in daily simulation, 2) discontinuous flow value along the river network during flood events and 3) irrational model parameters. The CREST model equipped with both the routing schemes have been tested in the Gan River basin. The distributed LRR scheme has been confirmed to outperform the lumped counterpart by two comparisons, hydrograph validation and visual speculation of the continuity of stream flow along the river: 1) The CREST v2.1 (version 2.1) with the implementation of the distributed LRR achieved excellent result of [NSCE(Nash coefficient), CC (correlation coefficient), bias] =[0.897, 0.947 -1.57%] while the original CREST v2.0 produced only negative NSCE, close to zero CC and large bias. 2) CREST v2.1 produced more naturally smooth river flow pattern along the river network while v2.0 simulated bumping and discontinuous discharge along the mainstream. Moreover, we further observe that by using the distributed LRR method, 1) all model parameters fell within their reasonable region after an automatic optimization; 2) CREST forced by satellite-based precipitation and PET products produces a reasonably well result, i.e., (NSCE, CC, bias) = (0.756, 0.871, -0.669%) in the case study, although there is still room to improve regarding their low spatial resolution and underestimation of the heavy rainfall events in the satellite products.",

Water column particles were collected by in situ filtration (0.2 micron, polycarbonate) from above, within, and below the hydrothermal plume. Water column samples were handled in an anaerobic chamber and stored frozen under inert gas shipboard, and protected from ambient oxygen during analysis. The flocculant, top-layer of the sediments was sampled shipboard under ambient conditions and stored frozen until analysis. Iron and carbon speciation were measured using X-ray microprobe (10.3.2) and scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) instruments at the Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA. Iron (1s and 2p) and carbon (1s) X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy and imaging for particles revealed that: (1) in comparison to the above plume sample, organic carbon is abundant in particles within and below the plume, as well as in surface sediments; (2) iron sulfides are not detectable in any water column sample investigated so far; (3) the fraction of non-sulfide reduced iron is highest in the below plume samples; and (4) the below plume sample is rich in free-living microbial cells.",

            "abstract": "There is growing interest in the use of seismic and acoustic data to interpret a variety of geomorphic processes including landslides and debris flows. This measurement technique is attractive because a broad area can be monitored from a safe distance, unlike more direct methods of instrumentation, which are restricted to known flow paths and are vulnerable to damage by the flow. Previous work has shown that measurements of ground vibrations are capable of detecting the timing, speed, and location of landslides and debris flows. A remaining question is whether or not additional flow properties, such as basal stress, impact force, or flow magnitude can be inferred reliably from seismic data. This question has been difficult to answer, because detailed, independent measurements of flow dynamics are lacking.\nHere, we explore characteristics of debris-flow induced ground vibrations using new data from the Chalk Cliffs monitoring site in central Colorado. Monitoring included a heavily instrumented cross-section consisting of two tri-axial geophones to record ground vibrations (at 333 Hz), a small, 225 cm2 force plate to record basal impact forces (at 333 Hz), a laser distance meter to record flow stage over the plate (at 10 Hz), and a high definition camera to record flow dynamics (at 24 Hz). One geophone (A) was mounted on a boulder partially buried in colluvium; the other (B) was mounted directly to weathered bedrock typical of the site. This combination of instrumentation allowed us to compare the spectral response of different geophone installations to independently measured flow depth and basal impact force. We also compared the response of the geophones to surges that flowed over a sediment-covered bed (40-cm thick) to surges that flowed over a bare bedrock channel.\nPreliminary results showed that site conditions have a large effect on recorded debris-flow vibrations. The seismic signature of debris flow was very different between the geophones, with geophone B exhibiting a broad frequency response during surges, while geophone A had energy concentrated in a narrower 30-90 Hz band. In addition, the presence of bed-sediment cover was found to damp the geophone signals. While further work is needed, these initial results highlight some of the challenges associated with extracting debris-flow dynamics from seismic data.",

The velocity vector makes its change in a few seconds. For shear layers with vector velocity changes greater than 50 km/s, an average of 12 shear layers pass the Earth per day. Global magnetospheric MHD simulations with four different simulation codes have been performed at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) to examine the reaction of the Earth to the solar-wind velocity shears. All 4 simulation codes predict comet-like disconnections of the magnetotail, the magnetosheath, and the bow shock on the flanks as a shear layer passes the Earth. The simulation codes also predict sudden changes in the cross-polar-cap potential and ionospheric Joule dissipation as the shear layers pass the Earth. A data-analysis research effort is underway to look for signatures of the Earth’s reaction to abrupt wind shear events; preliminary results of that effort will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The curvature of subducting lithosphere controls deformation due to bending at the trench, which results in a force that dissipates gravitational potential energy and may affect seismic coupling. We use 2‐D, thermo-mechanical subduction models to explore the dependence of the radius of curvature on the thickness of the subducting and overriding plates for models with both viscous and effectively plastic lithospheric rheologies. Such a plastic rheology has been shown to reproduce the bending stresses/moment computed using a kinematic strain rate description and a laboratory derived composite rheology. Laboratory and numerical models show that the bending geometry of subducting slabs with a viscous rheology is strongly dependent on slab thickness; thicker plates have a larger radius of curvature. However, the curvature of subducting plates on Earth, illuminated by the distribution of earthquake hypocenters, shows little to no dependence on the plate thickness or age. Such an observation is instead compatible with plates that have a plastic rheology. Indeed, our numerical models show that the radius of curvature of viscous plates has a stronger dependence on subducting plate thickness than in equivalent plastic models. In viscous plates, the bending moment produces a torque, which balances the torque exerted by buoyancy. However, for the plastic plate case the bending moment saturates at a maximum value and so cannot balance the gravitational torque. The saturation of bending moment means that, (a) the radius of curvature of the bending region is not constrained by this torque balance, and, (b) other forces are required to balance the gravitational torque. We explore the role that the overriding plate could play in controlling the subducting plate curvature in plastic plate models where the bending stresses have saturated. For such plates, we find that increasing the thickness of the overriding plate causes the radius of curvature to increase. The same correlation is found in real subduction zones when the radius of curvature is compared with near‐trench overriding lithospheric thickness. We suggest that the thickness of the overriding plate, through controlling the depth extent of the slab suction caused by the strong overriding plate, exerts a primary control on the curvature of subducting lithosphere.",

Exceptions to this overall trend are found in the Tasman Sea, where two chains of age-progressive volcanism are present, the Tasmantids and the Lord Howe seamount chain (LHSC). Both of these follow broadly north-south co-linear trends, recording rapid northwards motion of the Australian plate since >24 Ma. The bathymetric expression of the volcanic trails can be traced northwards towards the Coral Sea, which hosts a complex tapestry of poorly sampled plateaux and rises whose relationship to hotspot volcanism remains enigmatic.\nWe present the results of a marine geophysical and dredging survey to the eastern Coral Sea onboard the RV Southern Surveyor in October-November, 2012. We constrain the timing of basin opening in the South Rennell Trough and Santa Cruz Basin to between ~43-28 Ma, using a combination of magnetic anomaly profiles, seafloor fabric from swath bathymetry data, Ar-Ar dating of basalts and paleontological dating of carbonates. The evolution of this spreading system corresponds to the opening of the Solomon Sea further north, where chrons 19-16 have been identified, suggesting the existence of a single > 2,000 km long back-arc basin.\nRocks dredged from the northernmost volcanoes of the LHSC, close to the southern end of the South Rennell Trough, are dated at ~27-28 Ma. Geochemically the LHSC lavas are intraplate tholeiites and contrast with older E-MORB-type basalts formed at the ultra-slow spreading South Rennell Trough until ~28 Ma. These are the oldest rocks recovered from the LHSC, and their age confirms predictions from absolute plate motion modeling.",

            "abstract": "The phenology of vegetation emergence in the Arctic is highly sensitive to climatic fluctuations. Spring phenology drives ecological processes across local, population, and ecosystem scales. Traditional approaches to capturing spatio-temporal variation in the annual timing and pace of Arctic green-up, like satellite-derived and plot-level records, are limited by trade-offs in the grain and extent of monitoring through both space and time. Recent studies demonstrate the utility of tracking canopy phenology using near-surface digital repeat photography (phenocams) to overcome spatial and temporal grain limitations at the extent of individual plants or vegetation stands. However, our understanding of how fine-grain phenological dynamics scale to landscape extents is incomplete. Here we report on the fine-grain green-up dynamics of a low-Arctic tundra system in West Greenland at the extent of a caribou calving range (40 km2) using three years (2012-2014) of phenological records derived from a network of 50 phenocams, field observations, and high-resolution satellite imagery. Using geostatistics and multiple-regression models, we characterize spatiotemporal patterns of plant phenology, landscape controls on the timing of emergence of common shrub and graminoid species, and assess scale-dependency in patterns of vegetation green-up. We link these results with coarse-grained satellite records of plant phenology to clarify how fine-grained dynamics contribute to the widely reported broad-scale patterns of phenological and ecological change in the Arctic.",

            "abstract": "Seismic tomography is often an ill-posed linear inverse problem and regularization such as damping and smoothing has been widely applied to find an approximate solution to the inverse problem. The “optimal” solution is chosen based on the tradeoff between model norm (or model roughness) and data misfit. The main difficulty associated with this deterministic approach is in determining a balance between model uncertainty and data fit. This can make interpretation of tomographic structures subjective because models at the “corner” of the tradeoff curve often show large variability. In this study, we investigate a Bayesian approach to the linear inverse problem by minimizing an empirical Bayes risk function based on training dataset generated for the tomographic problem. We show that sample average approximation can be used to find optimal spectral filters to solve the linear tomographic problem based on singular value decomposition (SVD). We compare optimal truncated SVD, optimal Tikhonov filtering as well as independent optimal spectral filtering in finite-frequency tomography and ray theoretical tomography using a global dataset of surface-wave dispersion measurements.",

            "abstract": "Although current global reanalyses provide reasonably accurate large-scale features of the atmosphere, systematic errors are still found in the hydrological and energy budgets of such products. In the tropics, precipitation is particularly challenging to model, which is also adversely affected by the scarcity of hydrometeorological datasets in the region. With the goal of producing downscaled analyses that are appropriate for a climate assessment at regional scales, a regional spectral model has used a combination of precipitation assimilation with scale-selective bias correction. The latter is similar to the spectral nudging technique, which prevents the departure of the regional model’s internal states from the large-scale forcing. The target area in this study is the Amazon region, where large errors are detected in reanalysis precipitation.\nTo generate the downscaled analysis, the regional climate model used NCEP/DOE R2 global reanalysis as the initial and lateral boundary conditions, and assimilated NOAA's Climate Prediction Center (CPC) MORPHed precipitation (CMORPH), available at 0.25-degree resolution, every 3 hours. The regional model’s precipitation was successfully brought closer to the observations, in comparison to the NCEP global reanalysis products, as a result of the impact of a precipitation assimilation scheme on cumulus-convection parameterization, and improved boundary forcing achieved through a new version of scale-selective bias correction. Water and energy budget terms were also evaluated against global reanalyses and other datasets.",

            "abstract": "Small unmanned aerial systems (sUASs) have the potential to provide highly useful information for models of earth systems that vary over time intervals of days and for which sub-meter resolution is crucial. In particular, the state of coastal watershed plains are highly dependent on vegetation type and cover, soil type, weather, river flooding, and coastal inundation. The vegetation type and cover affect the drying potential, as well as the watershed’s resistance to flood water movement. The soil type, soil moisture, and pond depths affect the ability of the watershed to absorb river flood waters and inundation from the sea.\nIn this presentation we will describe a data collection campaign and model modification effort for hydrological models in a coastal watershed. The data collection campaign is obtaining data bimonthly using multiple UASs to capture the state of the watershed quicker. In particular, the vegetation cover and the extent of the water surface expression are captured at approximately a 1 inch spatial resolution over a few days with sUASs that can image 1-2 square miles per hour. The vegetation data provides a time-varying input to improve the estimation of the roughness coefficient and the dry potential from the traditionally static datasets. By correlating the high spatio-temporal resolution surface water expression with data from approximately ten river gauges, models can be improved and validated under more conditions.\nThe presentation will also discuss the requisite sUAS capabilities and our experience in using them.",

Beside these main common features however, desert boundary layers present extremely complex local structures that have been scarcely addressed in the literature, and whose understanding is essential in modeling processes such as transport and deposition of dust and pollutants, local wind fields, turbulent fluxes and their impacts on the sustainable development, human health and solar energy harvesting in these regions.\nIn this study, we explore the potential of the joint usage of Lidar Ceilometer backscattering profiles and sun-photometer optical depth retrievals to quantitatively determine the vertical aerosol profile over dusty hot desert regions. Toward this goal, we analyze a continuous record of observations of the atmospheric boundary layer height from a single lens LiDAR ceilometer operated at Masdar Institute Field Station (24.4425N 54.6163E, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates), starting March 2013, and the concurrent measurements of aerosol optical depth derived independently from the Masdar Institute AERONET sun-photometer. The main features of the desert ABL are obtained from the ceilometer range corrected backscattering profiles through bi-dimensional clustering technique we developed as a modification of the recently proposed single-profile clustering method, and therefore “directly” and “indirectly” calibrated to obtain a full diurnal cycle climatology of the aerosol optical depth and aerosol profiles. The challenges and the advantages of applying a similar methodology to the monitoring of aerosols and dust over hyper-arid regions are also discussed, together with the issues related to the sensitivity of commercial ceilometers to changes in the solar background.",

Such framework is not complete and not purely multiplicative. We present here a stochastic framework which stays in the multiplicative realm and can be used to generate zero values.\nThe multiplicative continuous model for multifractal fields with zero values is built using infinitely multiplicative random variables, the multiplicative analog to infinitely divisible distributions for addition. It also needs stochastic multiplicative measures and multiplicative stochastic integrals. The model hence generates continuous multiplicative cascades.\nThe model produced possesses as special case a continuous generalization of the classical discrete beta-model.

            "abstract": "The Arctic and Boreal regions are warming rapidly, leading to the thawing of the underlying permafrost and associated changes in vegetation structure and composition. The thawing of ice-rich permafrost drives land surface dynamics called thermokarst, characterized by a variety of geomorphic surface features across high latitude landscapes. The development of these thermokarst or thermo-erosional features depends on factors such as local permafrost conditions, hydrology, geomorphology, vegetation, and climate, but their degree of dependence are not well understood across scales. The structure, functions and traits of the vegetation can work as effective indicators of these landscape changes. Our ability to characterize these vegetation characteristics across a wide range of thaw gradients at the local scale could help us to better understand the dependency as well as the impacts of thermokarst processes on them. This will also help us to develop capabilities to quantify these characteristics and dependencies from local to regional scales by using remote sensing and ecosystem modeling techniques. During the months of June - July of 2013 and 2014, we conducted field surveys at various sites across the central Seward Peninsula in Alaska covering a range of thaw gradients to collect data for vegetation functional traits, ancillary data and also hyperspectral data in the 400-2500 nm range using a field spectrometer. Data were collected from plots established along 50 m transects to capture transitional states of these thaw features from the upland zone, transition zone, and thaw lake basins as well as in polygonal features. Here we discuss the characteristics of vegetation functional traits and how they relate to the ground-based spectral measurements. Some of these findings could be scaled up using airborne and satellite remote sensing data. The findings from this study can improve our understanding of disturbance patterns and their feedbacks to local scale plant and soil dynamics. Scaling up our understanding based on multi-scale remote sensing and ecosystem models over multiple spatial and temporal scales across landscapes could help us reduce uncertainties in estimating the carbon budget from local to pan-arctic scales.",

            "abstract": "There is a pressing need to generate spatially-explicit models of rainfall-runoff dynamics in the urban humid tropics that can characterize flow pathways and flood magnitudes in response to erratic precipitation events. To effectively simulate stormwater runoff processes at multiple scales, complex spatio-temporal parameters such as rainfall, evapotranspiration, and antecedent soil moisture conditions must be accurately represented, in addition to uniquely urban factors including stormwater conveyance structures and connectivity between green and gray infrastructure elements. In heavily urbanized San Juan, Puerto Rico, stream flashiness and frequent flooding are major issues, yet still lacking is a hydrological analysis that models the generation and movement of fluvial and pluvial stormwater through the watershed. Our research employs a novel and multifaceted approach to dealing with this problem that integrates 1) field-based rainfall interception and infiltration methodologies to quantify the hydrologic functions of natural and built infrastructure in San Juan; 2) remote sensing analysis to produce a fine-scale typology of green and gray cover types in the city and determine patterns of spatial distribution and connectivity; 3) assessment of precipitation and streamflow variability at local and basin-wide scales using satellite and radar precipitation estimates in concert with rainfall and stream gauge point data and participatory flood mapping; 4) simulation of historical, present-day, and future stormwater runoff scenarios with a fully distributed hydrologic model that couples diverse components of urban socio-hydrological systems from formal and informal knowledge sources; and 5) bias and uncertainty analysis of parameters and model structure within a Bayesian hierarchical framework. Preliminary results from the rainfall interception study suggest that canopy structure and leaf area index of different tree species contribute to variable throughfall and stemflow responses. Additional investigations are pending. The findings from this work will help inform urban planning and design, and build adaptive capacity to reduce flood vulnerability in the context of a changing climate.",

            "abstract": "Hydrologic measurement campaigns are often limited by battery resources or, as in the case of automated water quality samplers, the number of actual samples that can be taken. As such, it becomes imperative to strategically capture only events of interest, such as the “first flush” of a hydrograph. We address the need to capture abrupt signal changes in hydrologic systems by leveraging a network of low-cost, low-power sensor nodes that continuously monitor their environment and dynamically update their sampling frequency in response to real-time, on-board flow models and live precipitation forecasts obtained from WeatherUndergound. In our case, this enables the use of an automated sampler only when a sample is deemed necessary, permitting samples to be spaced out throughout entire storm events while preserving battery resources and extending the deployment period of each automated sampler. We discuss the deployment and evaluation of a web-enabled “intelligent” sensor network in an urban watershed in Michigan. Equipped with a suite of in-situ aquatic sensors, each node continuously monitors and transmits hydrologic measurements (e.g., temperature, conductivity, and gage height) in real-time. Results indicate that the system effectively and autonomously captures signals of interest while simultaneously reducing the use of sampling resources. We also investigate how these real-time sensor nodes provide insight into hydrologic systems during storm events.",

In further investigation on comparison of cycle days of MJO, duration of MJO active phases (4,5,6,and 7),low-frequency wind at 850hPa, large-scale convection circulation and vatiability of Surface Sea Temperatures (SST) and Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) in MJO active phases between 1979-1997 and 1998-2010, we found that: during 1998-2010,cycle days of MJO and duration of MJO active phases exhibited a significant decrease; low-frequency wind at 850hPa showed an eastern-wind transition; convective areas in MJO active phases decreased and anormaly of its SST were more negative. These may be reasons of difference of TC frequency in the period of 1979-1997 and 1998-2010.",

These instrument payloads are being miniaturized for an orbital opportunity to provide atmospheric temperature profile measurements, cloud ice mass statistics, sea ice/ice-free ocean detection and mapping, and ice sheet surface snow properties that complement and extend existing passive microwave measurements from space. Collectively, these instruments, currently being prototyped, will comprise the first multi-frequency millimeter-wave and submillimeter-wave (MMW/SMMW) passive microwave imaging sensors flown in space. The objective is to map the brightness temperature spectra of several critical cryospheric and tropospheric Earth systems at high spatial resolution (~18.5 km) and high radiometric precision (~0.3-2.0K) at three key bands (118.7503, 325.153-340, and 670 GHz) over the entire globe during a nominal one year mission beginning in 2016. We discuss the application of the integrated PC/CIC data sets to climatological cloud modeling, determination of the vertical temperature and water vapor structure of polar regions, polar climate and atmosphere change studies, sea ice mapping, and ice sheet snow accumulation. Importantly, global cloud ice mass and mean particle size mapping will be supported at ~2o spatial scale using a new and independent passive MMW/SMMW technique as a means to constrain general circulation model cloud statistics. The PC/CIC mission will provide an important snapshot of global cloud ice mass statistics in the current era years prior to operational passive microwave cloud ice measurement. It will also demonstrate the use of compact, multi-frequency, scanning microwave radiometers that are prototypes of a new low-cost class of spaceborne microwave weather and climate sensors.",

The western U.S. is mostly arid in the southwest, experiences heavy precipitation in the northwest, and influenced by the moisture coming from the Pacific Ocean. A study of the interactions between the Pacific Ocean climate variability and western U.S. streamflow is presented. Singular value decomposition (SVD) technique is used to evaluate the influence of winter season sea surface temperature (SST) on seasonal i.e., spring, summer, and spring-summer streamflow in six hydrologic regions in the western United States for 50 years (1960-2010). A lagged lead time approach was utilized i.e., previous year October to December SST were used to predict current year spring-summer (April to September), spring (April to June), and summer (July to September) streamflow for each hydrologic region. The variability in terms of lagged response of adjacent watersheds was established, which can be attributed to spatial and local factors. The temporal expansion series generated from SVD lead to high correlation values for spring-summer streamflow in the western United States. The SVD technique was applied to the six regions taken together, which addressed the bias generated when using global datasets. The results obtained from this study can be used to improve the current forecasting techniques for streamflow.\nKey words: Streamflow, Sea surface temperature, Singular value decomposition",

The impact of halogenated VSLS on halogen loading in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UT/LS) is uncertain, and their potential impacts on stratospheric ozone loss are not well-quantified. Slow, large-scale ascent of tropospheric air into the stratosphere occurs primarily in the tropics, but large midlatitude convective storms have been shown to rapidly transport tropospheric air into the stratosphere during summer months. In this work, data from the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry field campaign (DC3, summer 2012) is used to investigate vertical redistribution of halogenated VSLS from the planetary boundary layer (PBL) into the UT/LS region. UC Irvine's whole air sampler (WAS) was deployed onboard the NASA DC-8, and measured a suite of halogenated species including many halogenated VSLS. Using these measurements, the fractional contribution of each halogen species to the total halogen loading will be calculated for airmasses in the PBL, UT, and LS. Total halogen loading will be compared between UT/LS airmasses that have not been affected by convection and airmasses that have been affected by recent convection, and the impact of halogenated VSLS from the PBL on total halogen loading will be quantified. This will allow futher work to be done to assess the role of midlatitude convective storms on the chemistry and composition of the UT/LS region.",

            "abstract": "Obtaining temperature dependence of creep rate, that is, activation energy for the creep is critical in geophysics, since its value can indicate deformation mechanism and also allows to extrapolate the creep rate measured in the room experiments to geological conditions when the creep mechanism is identical in both cases. Although numerous experimental results have been obtained so far, the obtained activation energy often contains error range of >50 kJ/mol, which often causes large uncertainties in strain rate at applied geological conditions. To minimize this error, it is important to collect strain rates at many different temperatures with high accuracy. We conducted high temperature compression experiments on synthetic forsterite (90%vol) and enstatite (10vol %) aggregates under increasing and decreasing temperatures. We applied a constant load of ~20 MPa using uniaxial testing machine (Shimadzu AG-X 50kN). The temperature was changed from 1360°C to 1240°C by furnace attached to the machine. Prior to the applying the load to the samples the grain size was saturated at 1360°C for 24 hours to minimize grain growth during the test. Decreasing-rate of temperature was 0.11min/°C and 0.02min/°C at temperature ranges of 1360 to 1300 and 1300 to 1240 respectively. The increasing-rate of the temperature was the same as the decreasing-rate. Strain rates from every 1 degree were obtained successfully. After the experiment, we analyzed the microstructure of the sample with scanning electron microscopy to measure the grain diameter. Arrhenius plots of strain rate demonstrate very linear distribution at > 1300 °C giving an activation energy of 649 ± 14 kJ/mol, whereas weak transition to lower activation energy 550 ± 23 kJ/mol below 1300°C was observed. Tasaka et al. (2013) obtained the activation energy of 370 ± 50 kJ/mol from similar temperature ranges used in our study but finer-grained samples. Combining these results, we interpret our results of high activation energy to lattice diffusion of Si and lower activation energy to apparent values where deformation mechanism transits from volume diffusion to grain boundary diffusion at lower temperature condition.",

            "abstract": "Soils are the interface between the lithosphere and the atmosphere. The presence and thickness of a soil mantle is locally a function of the rate of parent material weathering and the net transport of soil downslope, which are both heavily controlled by the type and density of vegetation present. In semiarid landscapes, water is often both a limiting material to the growth of vegetation as well as additional control on weathering and erosion of soil. The goal of our study is to promote fundamental understanding of the sensitivity of soil thickness to changes in precipitation in these water-limited environments. To accomplish this, we have quantified denudation rates in a semi-arid ecosystem through field work and used these data to inform a variety of climate change simulations in a landscape evolution model.\nOur denudation rates were sampled from areas with varying elevation, slope, and aspect, all variables that engender differences in the vegetation of sagebrush steppe ecosystems. The data were collected using a sediment flux measurement technique where a GPS with sub-centimeter accuracy was used to periodically resample the movement of rebar that was installed in the regolith.\nWithin sagebrush steppe ecosystems, wildfires were historically common before the presence of humans. Contemporarily, after a disturbance invasive species are able to establish themselves more quickly than native plants can, and so fires have a much different effect on our landscapes than they did in the past. With Landlab, an open-source, community framework that supports the rapid development of integrated landscape development models, we have modeled the effect of this shift on landscape evolution. Our model is able to react to shifts in climate by changing the vegetation present and the recurrence interval of fires. We can, therefore, use the model to quantify the linkages between climate, local soil evolution, and landscape evolution under plausible alternative futures of climate.",

            "abstract": "Kinematic point source inversions using data from complex tectonic settings (e.g. geothermal or volcanic areas and mines) often result in large non-double-couple components. Examining events with mechanisms more complex than shear motion on a planar fault requires a sophisticated inversion method. We have developed a technique within the probabilistic Bayesian framework that combines previous knowledge about the mechanism with the information from the data and results in a posterior probability distribution for the model parameters. It is capable of yielding parameter uncertainties, which cannot be analytically calculated for a non-linear inversion that includes the source location. The code uses time-series of displacements of regional earthquakes and explosions with moderate magnitudes to compute the centroid location and the seismic moment tensor.\nThe noise is also treated as an unknown in the inversion, in order to determine the level of data fit. As a result, the model complexity (i.e. the contribution of isotropic and compensated linear vector dipole components) is determined by the data themself. Furthermore, the noise weights the contribution of each waveform and the noise covariance matrix accounts for both observational and theoretical errors.\nThe code has been extensively tested in synthetic experiments with a variety of focal mechanisms and different types of noise added to synthetic waveforms. It showed fast convergence of the centroid location, accompanied with thorough sampling of the moment tensor parameters leading to narrow posterior distributions. Subsequently, it is being applied to waveforms from earthquakes that occurred in various tectonic environments.",

            "abstract": "Bulk aerosol composition and aerosol volume size distributions measured aboard the NASA DC-8 during the NCAR DC-3 (Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry Experiment) mission in May/June 2012 were used to investigate the transport of mineral dust through twelve storms encountered over Colorado and Oklahoma. Measurements made at low altitudes (< 5 km) in the storm inflow region were compared to those made in the outflow in and around storm cirrus anvils (altitude > 9 km). Total coarse (1 μm < diameter < 5 μm) aerosol volume (Vc) and Ca2+ measured in both storm inflow and outflow were highly correlated, thus dust was assumed to dominate the aerosol coarse volume. Mean outflow Ca2+ concentrations were comparable to mean inflow values as demonstrated by average outflow/inflow Ca2+ ratios near unity. Vc outflow/inflow ratios were also high (>> 0.5) for most storms, suggesting coarse mode dust was efficiently transported through the CO and OK storms. Comparisons between inflow aerosol number concentration (Nc) calculated over a size range characteristic of dust ice nuclei (0.5 μm < diameter < 5 μm) and ice particle concentrations in storm anvils further suggested interstitial coarse mode dust was present in these cirrus anvils. For over half the storms, mean inflow Nc exceeded mean anvil ice particle concentrations implying ice nucleation mechanisms may be sensitive to complex dust characteristics beyond size. Possible artifacts associated with shattered ice crystals were examined via 1) closure calculations for observations from different instrumentation and independent aircraft inlets, and 2) assessment of relationships with cloud microphysical observations. Initial results indicate minimal influence of ice shatter on aerosol measurements, but effects vary for individual storms with different cloud microphysical characteristics.",

            "abstract": "Air pollutant emissions have been steadily increasing in China, and the need for emission mitigations has become crucial. In order to better understand the source and uncertainties of these emissions in China, we evaluated four global and regional emissions inventories: Regional Emission inventory in Asia version 2.1 (REASv2.1), Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research version 4.2 (EDGAR v4.2), Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC), and the other by Dr. Yu Zhao. We compared emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 10 μm (PM10), that of less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5), ammonia (NH3), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) from 2000 to 2008, and analyzed differences in emissions estimates by source sectors and provinces as well as the national total. In order to understand the cause of these differences in the transport sector, we also analyzed emission factors in depth. We find that the differences of China’s total CO2 emissions among the inventories is small (~2%), whereas that of PM10 emissions is large (200% ~ 350%) for 2008. Furthermore, emissions at the source sector level showed considerable differences for some species. For example, the differences among the inventories for the industry sector for PM10 ranged at 27 ~ 48%, and that for the transport sector for PM10 was larger than an order of magnitude for 2008. These discrepancies were also visible at the provincial level for various species and sectors. Residential sector tended to have the largest, and industry the smallest difference among inventories, though this was not true for all the species. Transportation sector had comparatively small difference, ranging usually in 10 ~ 30%, except for PM10.",

A considerable amount of research has been conducted into the morphological evolution of chemical dissolution fronts within an isotropic fluid-saturated porous medium. Although real geologic media are never perfectly isotropic, previous studies often assume they are. This study investigates temporal porosity evolution in an anisotropic fluid-saturated porous medium. A series of numerical simulations are performed to evaluate the morphological evolution of chemical dissolution front. Simulation results indicate that morphological evolution of chemical dissolution fronts not only depends on the spacing of two local non-uniformities and the upstream pressure gradient but also the medium anisotropic permeability ratio. However, the effect of the medium anisotropic permeability ratio decreases with increasing upstream pressure gradient.",

As part of Indo-Japan collaborative research project (DISANET) sponsored by JST and JICA, six sets of building vibration sensors have been installed in the Union Territory of Chandigarh, India.\nThe Union Territory of Chandigarh, India is located at South of the Himalayan Frontal Belt (HFT) is in zone IV of the seismic zone map of India (BIS, 2007). In past few decades, this area has experienced several minor earthquakes and a few moderate earthquakes. In spite of being in high seismic zone, most of the buildings in Chandigarh are designed and constructed for gravity loads only disregarding seismic forces. Such kind of buildings may deteriorate in strength even when they are subjected to minor earthquakes.\nTo understand the response of buildings to micro-tremors, vibration sensors were installed in the building of Department of Geology of Panjab University in July 2012. Subsequently 5 more buildings were instrumented by January 2014. For each building, in order to capture the overall vibration of building during earthquake, vibration sensors of 8 or 10 units are installed to the ground floor, top floor and middle floor of the building. These sensors are continuously monitoring the building vibration and recording all data which include the weak ground motion occurring from near to far earthquakes.\nThrough these sensors, over 20 minor ground motions have been recorded during last two years. Even in these weak ground motions, it was possible to confirm the state of the building response caused by earthquakes.\nIn this presentation, we will introduce some building vibration records caused by the weak ground motion of the earthquakes and discuss the important insights drawn from analysis of recorded data.",

To clarify the spatial and temporal properties of this variability and its mechanism, we deployed nine moorings in May 2014 at 30°N, 147°E where the ocean depth is about 6200 m with relatively flat topography. The nine (3×3) moorings, of which five had current meters at 6000, 5000, 4000 and 3000 m and the remaining four had them at 6000 and 4000 m, were arrayed in a diamond shape, whose zonal and meridional widths are both 100 km. We also conducted full-depth CTD observations at 16 (4×4) stations alternating with the moorings. The isopycnal of σ4 = 45.89 kg m-3 was deepest (6033 m) at the northeastern corner and was shallowest (5595 m) at the southwestern corner. Isotherms and isohalines exhibited similar spatial variation in the deep layer.\n To understand current variability obtained from ongoing and previous mooring observations, we have also analyzed outputs from a global eddy-resolving ocean general circulation model. The model was COCO model, with 62 vertical levels with thickness increasing from 2 m at the surface to 660 m at the bottom (7200 m depth), and was driven by the CORE Ver.2 interannual forcing. We analyzed the modelled current in 1997―2006 at five locations corresponding to our mooring sites. The eastward and northward 10-year mean velocities at 4000 m depth at the five locations were -0.51 to 0.25 cm s-1 and -1.03 to 1.27 cm s-1, respectively. These averages were smaller than their standard deviations that exceeded 1.4 cm s-1. The eddy kinetic energy (EKE) was 3.4 cm2 s-2 at the southernmost location (29°30’N, 147°E) and 11.1 cm2 s-2at the northernmost location (30°30’N, 147°E), increasing northward. These values were similar to those from previous mooring observations conducted near 30°N, 146°40’E in the late 1970’s. In the Northwest Pacific Basin, simulated EKE was highest at the Kuroshio Extension, and a high-EKE area extended about 500 km north and south of it.",

            "abstract": "As flood control infrastructure reaches its design life, and climate change, population growth, and urban migration increase flood risk, the historical paradigm of store-then-release floodwaters behind rigid infrastructure is of decreasing physical and socioeconomic value. Instead, a new paradigm of sustainable flood management is emerging, which can be framed in the context of three elements that can contribute to and/or mitigate flood risk: 1) water resources infrastructure, 2) policies and socioeconomics, and 3) changing climates and land use. In this presentation, I present the results of analysis on the role of these three elements in contributing to flood risk of the Sutlej River (India) and the Koshi River (Nepal) basins for six historical flood events. The Himalaya region was selected based on the a) increasing intensity of monsoonal rains, b) increasing prevalence of glacial lake outburst floods, c) water resources management that achieves short-term development goals but lacks long-term sustainability, and d) other socio-economic, environmental, and geopolitical factors.\nI develop and apply a flood risk management framework that is based on metrics for characterizing the losses associated with the three elements contributing to major floods in the Himalaya region. Derived from a variety of data sources, results highlight how, across different hydrogeologic settings and various flood magnitudes, the largest influences on high flood losses are associated with inflexible water resources infrastructure and inappropriate development and flood management policies. Particularly for the most destructive events, which are generally associated with landslides and other natural hazards in this region, the effectiveness of some types of traditional and inflexible flood management infrastructure, including large dams and levees, is limited.\nAs opposed to the probability of a particular flood event, findings illustrate the importance of the damages side of the flood risk equation, which is often the most controllable but disregarded element of flood risk management. In addition, results lead to a hypothesized matrix of appropriate flood management strategies for the types of flood events that occur in the hydrogeology and cultural settings of high mountain areas and the lowlands to which they drain.",

            "abstract": "While the relationship between fractional cover of anthropogenic and vegetation features and the urban heat island has been well studied, the effect of spatial arrangements (e.g., clustered, dispersed) of these features on urban warming or cooling are not well understood. The goal of this study is to examine if and how spatial configuration of land cover features influence land surface temperatures (LST) in urban areas. This study focuses on Phoenix, AZ and Las Vegas, NV that have undergone dramatic urban expansion. The data used to classify detailed urban land cover types include Geoeye-1 (Las Vegas) and QuickBird (Phoenix). The Geoeye-1 image (3 m resolution) was acquired on October 12, 2011 and the QuickBird image (2.4 m resolution) was taken on May 29, 2007. Classification was performed using object based image analysis (OBIA). We employed a spatial autocorrelation approach (i.e., Moran’s I) that measures the spatial dependence of a point to its neighboring points and describes how clustered or dispersed points are arranged in space. We used Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data acquired over Phoenix (daytime on June 10, 2011 and nighttime on October 17, 2011) and Las Vegas (daytime on July 6, 2005 and nighttime on August 27, 2005) to examine daytime and nighttime LST with regards to the spatial arrangement of anthropogenic and vegetation features. We spatially correlate Moran’s I values of each land cover per surface temperature, and develop regression models. The spatial configuration of grass and trees shows strong negative correlations with LST, implying that clustered vegetation lowers surface temperatures more effectively. In contrast, a clustered spatial arrangement of anthropogenic land-cover features, especially impervious surfaces, significantly elevates surface temperatures. Results from this study suggest that the spatial configuration of anthropogenic and vegetation features influence urban warming and cooling.",

            "abstract": "Spherical models for planetary spheres represent a common characterization of bulk global material properties, often satisfying up to 90% of recorded data. Our new methodology combines accurate seismic wave propagation with symmetry properties of radiation patterns, reciprocity, and high-order interpolation to deliver a comprehensive waveform database from which arbitrary source-receiver configurations and high-frequency record sections for a given model can be extracted within seconds. The database thus acts as a once-and-for-all solution to wave propagation in spherically symmetric models. This not only releases users from re-running wave propagation codes, but opens doors to new applications in which vast numbers of parameter alterations are desired such as modifications in source properties (moment tensor, source-time function, location), filtering, or background models, e.g. in a framework for probabilistic uncertainty assessment.\nUsing reciprocity, only 2 simulations with global wave-propagation solver AxiSEM (Nissen-Meyer et al. 2014, www.axisem.info) suffice to generate a complete database of Green's functions: one as a \"source\" for the vertical, and one for both horizontal components. Storage of the propagating spatio-temporal displacement field at all distances (0-180 degrees) and depths (0-700km for earthquakes) on the actual basis of the spectral-element mesh ensures the same accuracy as for the propagation system upon posteriori interpolation. The ease of computation (10.000 CPU hours) and tolerable storage requirements (~1TB for 1Hz waveforms) implies that multiple such databases may be computed for many models at high resolution (1Hz for global-Earth synthetics), e.g. continental versus oceanic crust, anisotropic versus isotropic, or a various lower-mantle models. One may also use our methodology in parameter-space studies for other planetary objects such as Mars, Mercury, Sun. Further applications include the efficient generation of reference synthetics for global tomography, wavefields for hybrid 1D-3D methods, and responses to finite-fault sources. A first example of such a database is being developed and stored at the IRIS DMC (Seattle), to deliver on-demand customizable synthetics.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the temporal variance of evapotranspiration (ET) at the watershed scale remains a challenging task, because it is affected by complex climate conditions, soil properties, vegetation, groundwater and human activities. In a changing environment with extensive and intensive human interferences, understanding ET variance and its factors is important for sustainable water resources management. This study presents an analysis of the effect of storage change caused by human activities on ET variance Irrigation usually filters ET variance through the use of surface and groundwater; however, over-amount irrigation may cause the depletion of watershed storage, which changes the coincidence of water availability and energy supply for ET. This study develops a framework by incorporating the water balance and the Budyko Hypothesis. It decomposes the ET variance to the variances of precipitation, potential ET, catchment storage change, and their covariances. The contributions of ET variance from the various components are scaled by some weighting functions, expressed as long-term climate conditions and catchment properties. ET variance is assessed by records from 32 major river basins across the world. It is found that ET variance is dominated by precipitation variance under hot-dry condition and by evaporative demand variance under cool-wet condition; while the coincidence of water and energy supply controls ET variance under moderate climate condition. Watershed storage change plays an increasing important role in determining ET variance with relatively shorter time scale. By incorporating storage change caused by human interferences, this framework corrects the over-estimation of ET variance in hot-dry climate and under-estimation of ET variance in cool-wet climate. Furthermore, classification of dominant factors on ET variance shows similar patterns as geographic zonation.",

            "abstract": "We present an experimental study investigating reaction pathways during the interaction of CO2-rich aqueous fluids with mantle peridotite, which have major implications for geochemical budgets and microbial life in oceanic lithosphere. Powdered harzburgite was reacted with a Ca-enriched fluid in a flexible-cell hydrothermal apparatus at 300°C and 35 MPa for 1.7 years. A CO2-rich fluid was subsequently injected and allowed to react for 8 months to examine the formation of carbonates under reducing conditions. Fluids were sampled throughout the experiment to monitor changes in fluid chemistry, and the secondary mineralogy was analyzed at the end of the experiment. Fluid speciation and mineral analyses suggest that initial serpentinization of harzburgite led to the precipitation of serpentine, brucite, magnetite, chlorite, calcite and Ni-sulfides. Fluids during this stage were characterized by low concentrations of dissolved Si, Mg and CO2, alkaline pH(25°C), and high concentrations of dissolved Ca, consistent with buffering by serpentine-brucite-diopside-calcite equilibria. H2(aq) concentrations increased during the first 10 months of reaction (due to magnetite formation), but subsequently plateaued, suggesting that serpentinization approached completion prior to CO2 injection. The introduction of CO2 resulted in acidic pH(25°C), substantial decreases in H2(aq) concentrations, and increases in dissolved SiO2 and Mg2+ concentrations. Dolomite and high-Mg calcite appear to have formed at the expense of olivine, calcite and likely brucite. However, petrographic observations suggest that Mg-calcite was only a transient phase and was ultimately destabilized in favor of dolomite. Replacement textures with carbonate in mesh centers are strikingly similar to those found in dolomite-altered abyssal serpentinites from the Atlantis Massif. While magnesite precipitation seems possible in ridge environments, high CO2(aq) and Ca2+ activities in serpentinization systems appear to favor the precipitation of dolomite over calcite and magnesite. Exposure of actively serpentinizing peridotite to CO2-rich aqueous fluids may therefore represent an important mechanism for dolomite formation and explain the low abundance of magnesite in mid-ocean ridge serpentinites.",

The final water consumption is evapotranspiration into atmosphere, so it is important to estimate the evapotranspiration in urban area. Usually the urban area is considered as an area of low evapotranspiration, but it is challenged by the wet islands effects. In order to make it clear, we estimated the evapotranspiration by water balance based on the hydrology information and water process data of Beijing from 2003 to 2012. The water balance analyses were made in total area and different sub area including mountain area, plain area, urban area and the suburban area. The results show that (1) the average evapotranspiration in Beijing was close to the precipitation so Beijing made limited contribution to the water resources of the Haihe River Basin; (2) the average evapotranspiration in urban area is about 928mm/a, even higher than the evaporation on water surface; (3) the evapotranspiration in urban area controlled by the precipitation and human activities. We can conclude that the evapotranspiration or water consumption in urban area is higher than that in surround area in Beijing.",

            "abstract": "Resistant bedrock outcrop can exert strong control on river long profile adjustment, upstream transmission of base level fall, and valley development, particularly in post-orogenic settings. Though resistant dolerite (diabase) outcrop in river beds provides a key control on fluvial landscape dynamics in the South African interior, the rates and patterns of change have remained poorly constrained. Cosmogenic 3He measurements made in this study are the first known estimates of river incision and valley development rates in South African dolerite and yield new insight on valley evolution.\nBed incision and valley development rates on three short reaches of the Klip River, Mooi River, and Schoonspruit vary as a function of local geomorphic context though cross-sectional patterns of valley denudation are broadly similar among the sites. Channel bed incision occurs primarily through hydraulic plucking of joint-bounded dolerite blocks and minor subaerial weathering with rates varying from ~12-254 m/My. Subaerial denudation on the low-relief valley tops varies from ~20-50 m/My and the valley side denudation rates vary from ~11-12 m/My. At each of the study sites, channel bed and valley top denudation rates are approximately in balance for long intervals of time but valley side denudation rates are negligible. Valleys are roughly in topographic steady state, maintaining cross-sectional depth and width while lowering in pace with the broader landscape. The steady state condition can be interrupted by transient periods of enhanced channel bed incision that deepen the valley.\nIn this post-orogenic setting, enhanced bed incision is typically accomplished by knickpoints that arise from a variety of intrinsic factors including enhanced rates of block plucking (owing to variation in weathering and structure) and incision into underlying weaker lithologies. Knickpoints correlate closely with resistant dolerite outcrop in the study area, and are long-lived (commonly > 105 years) features of river long profiles with positions, morphologies, and retreat rates that are unrelated to uplift timing and magnitude. The results demonstrate the critical role of river incision through resistant lithologies as a driver of fluvial landscape dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Human modification of the nitrogen (N) cycle has resulted in increased flows of reactive N, with some suggesting that planetary boundaries for maintaining human and ecosystem health have been exceeded. Persistence of large hypoxic zones in inland and coastal waters created by elevated concentrations of nitrate is one of the most significant impacts of such increased flows. While the need to manage these flows is recognized, best management practices to reduce stream N concentrations have had only limited success. Some have attributed this lack of success to accumulation of legacy N stores from decades of fertilizer application. Here we introduce an unprecedented analysis of long-term soil data from the Mississippi River Basin (MRB) revealing significant increases in total N (TN) content. We show that TN accumulation for the MRB accounts for 43% of net anthropogenic N inputs, complementing previous work indicating an approximately 25% loss of net inputs as riverine output. These findings significantly reduce uncertainty associated with basin-level N retention and demonstrate the presence of N accumulation in the deeper subsurface of agricultural soils. The presence of such legacy N stores is utilized in the development of a conceptual framework for quantifying catchment-scale time lags based on both soil nutrient accumulations (biogeochemical legacy) and groundwater travel time distributions (hydrologic legacy). Time scales of change for stream nutrient concentrations are explored as a function of both natural and anthropogenic controls, from topography to spatial patterns of land-use change, and an optimization approach has been developed to determine maximum possible concentration reduction benefits within time frames of interest.",

            "abstract": "As global temperatures rise, snow resources over North America are predicted to change in significant ways. Long-term changes in the timing of the snow season and amount of snow will negatively impact natural ecosystems and the human use of snow resources for water storage, hydroelectric power production, irrigation and recreation. Here we examine future changes in snowpack (snow water equivalent, SWE) using the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP, Mearns et al. 2013) suite of regional climate models (RCMs). These models are intended for use in climate process studies as well as climate change impacts and adaptation studies.\nSWE from the current climate simulations of the NARCCAP models is compared against an ensemble of off-the-shelf, gridded “observation based” SWE products compiled from a number of sources (satellite, reanalysis, snow-pack models, gridded observations). During winter, the RCMs are found to overestimate SWE in the mountains of western North America. Also, simulated snow tends to stay on the ground for longer than observed in mountainous regions. By mid-Century, the NARCCAP RCMs predict that winter SWE amounts will decrease dramatically over most of North America. The only exception to this is in northern Canada, where warmer temperatures mean it is no longer “too cold to snow” and SWE amounts increase. In some regions, such as the Southern Rockies, the models suggest that decreases in SWE are linked to changes in both precipitation type (transition from snow to rain) and an increase in snowmelt. In other areas, such as New England, the processes driving changes in SWE are less clear. In addition to changes in winter snowpack amounts, the NARCCAP models show that the snow season (defined here as the time with measurable snow on the ground) will decrease substantially. In the future peak snow amounts are expected to occur earlier in the season, and significant snowmelt will happen earlier in spring. These changes will have significant repercussions for water, energy, agriculture, and recreation in the west.",

            "abstract": "The hydration state of the downgoing Juan de Fuca (JdF) plate is important to a number of subduction processes at Cascadia, yet is poorly known. As oceanic plates subduct, faults develop at the outer rise due to flexural bending and have been shown to facilitate plate hydration near the trench. We present pre-stack time migrated (PSTM) images of two cross-plate transects offshore Oregon and Washington to characterize faulting within the Juan de Fuca Plate. Basement faulting evident from vertical offsets in the sediment section is observed as far as 200 km seaward of the deformation front, and may result from complex intraplate stresses within the JdF plate. Along the Oregon margin, bright fault plane reflections within the crust are observed beginning ~40 km seaward of the deformation front. They are sparsely spaced, form in conjugate pairs, and cut completely through the crust. We suggest they are related to plate bending. Within the same region, a set of mantle reflections, possibly originating from the continuations at depth of some of the crustal faults, extend as deep as ~6 km beneath the Moho. The waveforms of the fault plane reflections vary with depth, implying variation of the internal structure and/or pore fluid pressure within the fault zones. Along the Washington margin, densely spaced faults that may be bending-related are confined to the upper and middle crust and most of them are seaward dipping. Mantle reflections are not observed on this transect. In the lower crust, a set of dipping events is imaged, they are spaced at 1-2 km, dip ~ 30° towards the ridge and shoal into the Moho reflection. The crust in which these reflections are observed is 6-8 Ma old. Lower crustal reflections with similar characteristics are also observed in crust of same age on our Oregon transect, suggesting they are related to accretionary processes at the JdF Ridge during this time period. We conclude that different faulting patterns at Oregon and Washington margin result from along-strike variations in bending and intraplate stresses, and the pre-existing crustal structure. Localized alteration around faults is inferred at the Oregon margin.",

            "abstract": "In the last decade, there has been a surge in research on the use of time-varying temperature records (e.g. diel temperature) to estimate seepage velocity of water across stream channel boundaries into or out of the hyporheic zone. The hallmark of this research is the use temperature signals measured over length scales of a few meters to determine the properties of interest. Application of the methods at the river reach scale (e.g. tens of meters) using seasonal temperatures signals has not been explored. For instance, research in the Umatilla River basin in north central Oregon USA shows that seasonal temperature records from the hyporheic zone exhibit characteristic phase lagging and amplitude damping that closely matches similar characteristics observed in diel temperature signals typically used to estimate streambed seepage velocity. We demonstrate that at these larger scales, aquifer thermal dynamics are controlled by mechanical dispersion rather than thermal conduction. The trade-off between conduction and dispersion is apparent in plots of the ratio (r) of dispersive to conductive forces verses the thermal Peclet number (Pe). Plotting a range of analytical solutions for r and Pe over a range of hydraulic conductivities and dispersivities allows visual comparison of of their relative position in a spreading-transport domain. We show that when dispersivity and velocity are large, dispersion governs both spreading and transport processes of thermal energy in contrast to conduction. This finding is analogous to well-known findings from solute transport theory that show a trade off from conductive forces to dispersive forces as both scale and velocity increase. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when reasonable values for dispersion are not included in analytical temperature solutions using seasonal temperature records, unrealistic minimal amplitude damping results. Our results suggest that incorporating dispersion into analytical and modeling solutions is key to understanding annual water temperature dynamics in semi-arid streams.",

            "abstract": "Holocene moisture trends provide a useful context for historic hydrologic variations and potential future changes, and serve as key benchmarks for assessing paleoclimate dynamics. Many different approaches exist for paleohydrologic reconstruction, and comparisons offer an opportunity to validate key patterns and gain information based on differences. We consider multiple datasets from two mid-latitude regions of North America to evaluate centennial-to-millennial hydrologic variability during the Holocene. Comparisons of proxies at individual sites (i.e., pollen-inferred precipitation, reconstructed lake levels, hydrogen isotope ratios of biomarkers) and comparisons of proxies across sites in different hydrologic settings (i.e., closed vrs open lakes) provide insight into regional changes, while differences between the semi-arid (Wyoming) and humid (New England) regions reveal shifts in continental-scale moisture gradients.\nPollen-inferred precipitation records were developed using the modern analog technique, which matches fossil pollen data to the climates of equivalent modern pollen assemblages. Lake moisture budgets were quantified in terms of mm/yr of precipitation minus evapotranspiration based on water-level histories systematically reconstructed from transects of sediment cores and geophysical data. Comparisons of the budgets for open and closed lakes, which have modern lake water isotopic values consistent with no or substantial evaporative losses respectively, were used to differentiate precipitation and evapotranspiration trends. Hydrogen isotopic values of aquatic versus terrestrial biomarkers, as well as comparisons with oxygen isotopic values of carbonate sediment, provide additional constrains on the magnitude of past evaporation trends that enrich the heavy isotope composition of lake water and thus aquatic substrates.\nIn New England, pollen-inferred precipitation trends closely agree (Adj. R2 = 0.80) with replicated lake-level reconstructions, which show >300 mm/yr increase in effective moisture over the Holocene as well as repeated multi-century fluctuations. The trends indicate significant changes in the east-west moisture gradient before ca. 8000 BP and at ca. 5000 BP, in part due to changes in warming-induced evaporation in Wyoming.",

CYGNSS consists of a constellation of eight small observatories carried into orbit on a single launch vehicle. The eight satellites comprise a constellation that flies closely together to measure the ocean surface wind field with unprecedented temporal resolution and spatial coverage, under all precipitating conditions, and over the full dynamic range of wind speeds experienced in a TC.\nThe 8 CYGNSS observatories will fly in 500 km circular orbits at a common inclination of ~35°. Each observatory includes a Delay Doppler Mapping Instrument (DDMI) consisting of a modified GPS receiver capable of measuring surface scattering, a low gain zenith antenna for measurement of the direct GPS signal, and two high gain nadir antennas for measurement of the weaker scattered signal. Each DDMI is capable of measuring 4 simultaneous bi-static reflections, resulting in a total of 32 wind measurements per second across the globe by the full constellation.\nSimulation studies will be presented which examine the sampling as functions of various orbit parameters of the constellation. For comparison purposes, a similar analysis is conducted using the sampling of several past and present conventional spaceborne ocean wind scatterometers. Differences in the ability of the sensors to resolve the evolution of the TC inner core will be examined.\nThe CYGNSS observatories are currently in Phase C development. An update on the current status of the mission will be presented, including the expected precision, accuracy and spatial and temporal sampling properties of the retrieved winds.",

            "abstract": "Black carbon (BC) is considered to be potentially the 2nd most important global warming factor behind CO2 (Bond et al., 2013). Uncertainties exist due to BC morphology and mixing state on the extent of the warming that it causes, e.g. Cappa et al., 2012. Core-shell BC is expected to enhance absorption by up to a factor of 2, but has yet to be observed to this extent from ambient data. Experiments were conducted during the Soot Aerosol Aging Study (SAAS) Laboratory Campaign at Pactific Northwest National Laboratory’s Environmental Chamber in the winter of 2013-2014 to investigate the relationship between coatings and enhancements from diesel emissions.\nDirect on-line measurements were made with the single particle soot photometer (SP2) from fresh and aged BC from coating and coagulation experiments with secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formed in the chamber. BC measurements are coupled with photoactoustic measurements spanning the visible region to probe BC enhancements when mixed with SOA. Here we focus on the enhancements at 781 nm, that are tracked throughout SOA growth on BC, as determined from SP2 coating thicknesses. Thermal denuder (TD) experiments are conducted and enhancements are calculated from two different methods that agree well with each other, confirming the observed results. BC measurements are also compared with co-located measurements from SPLAT-II and filter analysis using SEM and TEM.\nBC coagulated with SOA produces minimal absorption enhancement values, whereas coatings are observed to have significant enhancement values at 300 degrees C, e.g. 1.3 for thickly coated BC. BC particles were coagulated with SOA in the chamber since this morphology has been observed in wildfire emissions (Sedlacek et al., 2012). Since we did not observe appreciable enhancements for the coagulated BC, we expect that ambient emissions dominated by this particle type to have enhancements due to other sources, such as brown carbon (BrC) that is often co-emitted (Saleh et al., 2014).\nWe also observed thickly coated BC that is not detected by the SP2 when the coatings are too thick for the laser to evaporate the coating and for the BC core to receive enough energy from the laser to incandesce. This noted caveat warrants more research to determine how prevalent this BC particle type is and how it would be expected to impact climate.",

The whole year's samples could be classified into two groups using cluster analysis: one group was from May to September, another group was from October to April of next year, corresponding to monsoon period and non-monsoon period, respectively. The classification represents two different atmospheric circulation systems, ASM in monsoon period and the Westerlies in non-monsoon period. Discriminant analysis was performed. First, the whole year samples were divided into two a priori groups, group A is monsoon period (May-Sep.) and group B is non-monsoon period (Oct.-Apr.). Then percentage data of major pollen taxa were used to establish the discriminant functions, and then the samples were classified into predicted groups. The results of discriminant analysis show that 78.6% of the samples were cross-validated grouped correctly. Thus, airborne pollen assemblages can distinguish two different climate systems: monsoon period and non-monsoon period. According to the discriminant score, the group centroids of group A and group B were negative and positive, respectively. Therefore, we created the discriminant score as a new monsoon index (PDI, Pollen Discriminant Index), small PDI values represented enhanced summer monsoon climate. Using above result, we calculated the PDI of Nam Co NCL core, the PDI values can be coincided with Dryness (moisture indicator) and A/Cy ratio (temperature indicator).",

This project investigates how sea level rise and nutrient enrichment impact salt marsh accretion in the Waquoit Bay Estuary on the southwest coast of Cape Cod, MA, USA. The region is a recognized hot spot of sea level rise over the past 25 years, and it has experienced accelerated nitrogen enrichment related to population growth over the past 60 years. Eleven piston cores were collected from four marshes experiencing a gradient in nutrient enrichment. Preliminary results are based on a 90 cm core from Sage Lot Pond that spans approximately 490 years. Sediment accretion rates, determined from 137Cs and 210Pb, indicate an acceleration in marsh vertical growth since 1950. Concurrent evaluation of bulk carbon content shows increased carbon burial over the same time period. Additionally, sediment nitrogen content has increased while δ15N values became heavier, potentially indicative of anthropogenic nitrogen loading. These data will contribute to our understanding of the capacity of the marshes to contribute to carbon burial while responding to changes in climate and land use.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the dynamics of rhyolitic conduits and lava flows, requires precise knowledge of how viscosity (η) varies with temperature (T), pressure (P) and volatile content (X). In order to address the paucity of viscosity data for high-silica rhyolite at low water contents, which represent water saturation at near-surface conditions, we made 245 viscosity measurements on Mono Craters (California) rhyolites containing between 0.01 and 1.1 wt.% H2O, at temperatures between 796 and 1774 K using parallel plate and concentric cylinder methods at atmospheric pressure. We then developed and calibrated a new empirical model for the log of the viscosity of rhyolitic melts, where non-linear variations due to temperature and water content are nested within a linear dependence of log η on P. The model was fitted to a total of 563 data points: our 245 new data, 255 published data from rhyolites across a wide P-T-X space, and 63 data on haplogranitic and granitic melts under high P-T conditions. Statistically insignificant parameters were eliminated from the model in an effort to increase parsimony and the final model is simple enough for use in numerical models of conduit or lava flow dynamics:\nlog η = -5.142+(13080-2982log⁡(w+0.229))/(T-(98.9-175.9 log⁡(w+0.229)))- P(0.0007-0.76/T )\nwhere η is in Pa s, w is water content in wt.%, P is in MPa and T is in K. The root mean square deviation (rmsd) between the model predictions and the 563 data points used in calibration is 0.39 log units. Experimental constraints have led previously to spurious correlations between P, T, X and η in viscosity data sets, so that predictive models may struggle to correctly resolve the individual effects of P, T and X, and especially their cross-correlations. The increasing water solubility with depth inside a simple isothermal sheet of obsidian suggests that viscosity should decrease by ~1 order of magnitude at ~20m depth and by ~2 orders of magnitude at ~100m depth. If equilibrium water contents are maintained, then deformation in spreading obsidian flows should be strongly partitioned into the deeper parts of the flow. Kinetically inhibited degassing, or recycling of degassed crust into a flow interior (e.g. by caterpillar-tread motion) could lead to strong lateral variations in viscosity within a flow, affecting flow evolution and morphology.",

The first step uses a recent seismic model (Crust1.0) to estimate the thickness of crystalline crust above the Moho, modified in the Andes and the Himalayas to account for the non-magnetic lower crust there. The second step calculates the magnetic field expected from such a layer of crystalline rock assuming the magnetization is solely induced in the earth’s main field by rock of constant magnetic susceptibility, and modifies the starting crustal thickness to bring it into agreement with the Xchaos model. This global model removes spherical harmonic degrees less than 15 to account for the core field mask. We restrict our attention to the continental crust, in particular to Australia, western North America, and Scandinavia. Petrophysical and petrological data from Scandinavian rocks that have been deep in the crust help place limits on susceptibility values. Our simulations use two susceptibilities, 0.02 and 0.04 SI. The mean crystalline crustal thickness from the seismic model is 42 and 37 km in western North America and Australia, respectively, and the modification with the magnetic data makes little change to the mean crustal thickness, irrespective of whether the susceptibility is 0.02 or 0.04 SI. However, the modification with the magnetic data does make a significant difference to the standard deviation of the crustal thickness, increasing it by a factor of two in the case of a susceptibility of 0.04, and by a factor of four in the case of a susceptibility of 0.02. The changes to the standard deviation of the crustal thickness are also evident in the Scandinavian data, but the mean crystalline crustal thickness of 45 km is significantly larger than that found from either magnetic model (33 and 30 km). The differences could be due to magnetic remanence oblique to the present field, or to weaker magnetizations in the crust. We use Swarm data from 10 April (Kp<0+) to place bounds on the minimum apparent magnetization required, irrespective of direction, to explain the observations, in an approach pioneered by Parker.",

            "abstract": "One of the key findings during the Phoenix and Mars Science Laboratory landed Mars missions has been the detection of perchlorate, a highly deliquescent salt. Perchlorates are of great interest on Mars due to their high affinity for water vapour as well as their ability to greatly depress the freezing point of water when in solution. This has intriguing biological implications as resulting brines could potentially provide a habitable environment for living organisms. Additionally, it has been speculated that these salts may play a significant role in influencing the hydrological cycle on Mars. In order to experimentally study brine formation on Mars and assess the feasibility of a future landed detection tool, a stand-off Raman spectroscopy instrument and environmental simulation chamber have been developed at York University. A sample of magnesium perchlorate has been subjected to the water vapour pressure, background pressure and temperatures found at polar Martian latitudes. Results indicate that at a water vapour pressure of ~20 Pa, Raman spectroscopy is able to detect the onset of brine formation and provide an estimate of the quantity of water taken up by the sample. At the lower water vapour pressures typically found on Mars ( ~1 Pa), it appears that slower dynamics inhibit the onset of water uptake over relevant time scales. The experimental setup and current results will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic is undergoing rapid climatic changes, which are some of the most coordinated changes currently occurring anywhere on Earth. They are exemplified by the retreat of the perennial sea ice cover, which integrates forcing by, exchanges with and feedbacks between atmosphere, ocean and land. While historical reconstructions from Global Climate and Global Earth System Models (GC/ESMs) are in broad agreement with these changes, the rate of change in the GC/ESMs remains outpaced by observations. Reasons for that stem from a combination of coarse model resolution, inadequate parameterizations, unrepresented processes and a limited knowledge of physical and other real world interactions.\nWe demonstrate the capability of the Regional Arctic System Model (RASM) in addressing some of the GC/ESM limitations in simulating observed seasonal to decadal variability and trends in the sea ice cover and climate. RASM is a high resolution, fully coupled, pan-Arctic climate model that uses the Community Earth System Model (CESM) framework. It uses the Los Alamos Sea Ice Model (CICE) and Parallel Ocean Program (POP) configured at an eddy-permitting resolution of 1/12° as well as the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) models at 50 km resolution. All RASM components are coupled via the CESM flux coupler (CPL7) at 20-minute intervals.\nRASM is an example of limited-area, process-resolving, fully coupled earth system model, which due to the additional constraints from lateral boundary conditions and nudging within a regional model domain facilitates detailed comparisons with observational statistics that are not possible with GC/ESMs. In this talk, we will emphasize the utility of RASM to understand sensitivity to variable parameter space, importance of critical processes, coupled feedbacks and ultimately to reduce uncertainty in arctic climate change projections.",

            "abstract": "Seismic source mechanism is a useful property to indicate the source physics and stress and strain distribution in regional, local and micro scales. In this study we jointly invert source mechanisms and locations for microseismics induced in fluid fracturing treatment in the oil and gas industry.\nFor the events that are big enough to see waveforms, there are quite a few techniques can be applied to invert the source mechanism including waveform inversion, first polarity inversion and many other methods and variants based on these methods. However, for events that are too small to identify in seismic traces such as the microseismics induced by the fluid fracturing in the Oil and Gas industry, a source scanning algorithms (SSA for short) with waveform stacking are usually applied. At the same time, a joint inversion of location and source mechanism are possible but at a cost of high computation budget. The algorithm is thereby called Source Location and Mechanism Scanning Algorithm, SLMSA for short. In this case, for given velocity structure, all possible combinations of source locations (X,Y and Z) and source mechanism (Strike, Dip and Rake) are used to compute travel-times and polarities of waveforms. Correcting Normal moveout times and polarities, and stacking all waveforms, the (X, Y, Z , strike, dip, rake) combination that gives the strongest stacking waveform is identified as the solution. To solve the problem of high computation problem, CPU-GPU programing is applied. Numerical datasets are used to test the algorithm. The SLMSA has also been applied to a fluid fracturing datasets and reveal several advantages against the location only method: (1) for shear sources, the source only program can hardly locate them because of the canceling out of positive and negative polarized traces, but the SLMSA method can successfully pick up those events; (2) microseismic locations alone may not be enough to indicate the directionality of micro-fractures. The statistics of source mechanisms can certainly provide more knowledges on the orientation of fractures; (3) in our practice, the joint inversion method almost always yield more events than the source only method and for those events that are also picked by the SSA method, the stacking power of SLMSA are always higher than the ones obtained in SSA.",

            "abstract": "A more accurate prediction of future climate-carbon (C) cycle feedbacks requires better understanding and improved representation of the carbon cycle in permafrost regions within current earth system models. Here, we evaluated 10 terrestrial ecosystem models for their estimated net primary productivity (NPP) and its vulnerability to climate change in permafrost regions in the Northern Hemisphere. Those models were run retrospectively between 1960 and 2009. In comparison with MODIS satellite estimates, most models produce higher NPP (310 ± 12 g C m-2 yr-1) than MODIS (240 ± 20 g C m-2 yr-1) over the permafrost regions during 2000‒2009. The modeled NPP was then decomposed into gross primary productivity (GPP) and the NPP/GPP ratio (i.e., C use efficiency; CUE). By comparing the simulated GPP with a flux-tower-based database [Jung et al. Journal of Geophysical Research 116 (2011) G00J07] (JU11), we found although models only produce 10.6% higher mean GPP than JU11 over 1982‒2009, there was a two-fold disparity among models (397 to 830 g C m-2 yr-1). The model-to-model variation in GPP mainly resulted from the seasonal peak GPP and in low-latitudinal permafrost regions such as the Tibetan Plateau. Most models overestimate the CUE in permafrost regions in comparison to calculated CUE from the MODIS NPP and JU11 GPP products and observation-based estimates at 8 forest sites. The models vary in their sensitivities of NPP, GPP and CUE to historical changes in air temperature, atmospheric CO2 concentration and precipitation. For example, climate warming enhanced NPP in four models via increasing GPP but reduced NPP in two other models by decreasing both GPP and CUE. The results indicate that the model predictability of C cycle in permafrost regions can be improved by better representation of those processes controlling the seasonal maximum GPP and the CUE as well as their sensitivity to climate change.",

            "abstract": "The Paleoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic Albany-Fraser Orogen is situated along the southeastern margin of the Archean Yilgarn Craton in Western Australia. The orogen records a long history of extension and magmatism, dominantly in a rift or back-arc setting, inboard of the collision zone between the West Australian and South Australian Cratons. The extensional structures were inverted during formation of a fold and thrust architecture during the Mesoproterozoic, which must have left its mark on the orogen's deep crustal and lithospheric structure.\nIn November 2013, a 40-station passive seismic array was installed across the east Albany-Fraser Orogen, which was shifted southeast, along strike of the orogen, in October 2014. The goal of this project is the retrieval of three-dimensional models of crustal and mantle lithospheric structure for the east Albany-Fraser Orogen, thereby extending recently acquired active seismic profiles into the third dimension. First results from analyzing the data recorded by the northern sub-array are presented, exploiting ambient noise, receiver functions and information from occasional local events.\nAmbient noise tomography yields a three-dimensional S-wave velocity model of the upper and middle crust. The obtained velocity distribution shows a marked contrast between faster upper crustal velocities throughout the Yilgarn margin and the Albany-Fraser Orogen and markedly slower velocities in the Eucla Basin further east. The Fraser Zone, a ~450 km long body of metamorphic gabbros in the Albany-Fraser Orogen, shows up as a prominent upper crustal high-wavespeed anomaly. At mid-crustal levels, the average seismic velocitiy decreases, and the basement beneath the Eucla Basin appears to be faster than the regions further west. P receiver functions have been used for the estimation of bulk crustal Vp/Vs (H-K stacking) as well as for Bayesian inversion that yields a 1D S-wave velocity profiles. The westernmost stations, which lie on the unmodified margin of the Yilgarn Craton, show a crustal thickness of around 35-38 km, and a very sharp Moho. Crustal thickness increases southwestwards, reaching maximum values of up to 50 km beneath the Biranup and Fraser Zones of the Albany-Fraser Orogen. Towards the Eucla Basin in the east, the crust thins again to about 40 km.",

The study presents open water classifications over the wetland dominated Sheppard Slough watershed east of Calgary in western Canada using parallel temporal imagery captured from the RapidEye and RadarSat satellites throughout 2013, a year of widespread and costly flood inundation in this region. The optical and SAR-based temporal image stacks were integrated with a high-resolution lidar DEM in order to delineate regions of inundation on the DEM surface. GIS techniques were developed to extract lidar-derived water surface elevations and track the spatio-temporal variation in pond and lake water level across the watershed. Water bodies were assigned unique identifiers so that levels could be tracked and linked to their associated watershed channel reach. The procedure of optical image classification through to merging of individual water bodies into watershed channel topology and extracting reach water levels has been automated within python scripts. The presentation will describe: i) the procedures used; ii) a comparison of the SAR and optical classification and water level extraction results; iii) a discussion of the spatio-temporal variations in water level across the Sheppard Slough watershed; and iv) a commentary on how the approach could be implemented for web-based operational monitoring and as simulation initialisation inputs for flood inundation model studies.",

            "abstract": "The combined use of Lidar and radar interferometry to estimate canopy height can be classified into 3 categories: cross-validation, simple combination and fusion methods. In this presentation, we investigate the potential of each category for local and regional scale applications, and assess their sensitivity to instrument configuration, terrain topography and variations in the vertical forest canopy profiles.\nIn addition to field data, we use data from TanDEM-X, UAVSAR (Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar), LVIS (Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor) and a commercial discrete lidar. TanDEM-X is a pair of X-band spaceborne radars flying in formation to provide a global digital surface model and can also be used to perform polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (polinSAR) inversion of canopy height. The UAVSAR is an airborne fully polarimetric radar enabling repeat-pass interferometry and has been used for polinsar. While LVIS records the full waveform within a 20m footprint, the discrete lidar collects a cloud of points. The lidar data can be used to validate the polinSAR results (validation), to obtain ground elevation (simple combination with radar surface models) or within the polinSAR inversion model through a common model framework.\nThe data was collected over the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve, a managed territory covering 7861km2 which is located between Québec city and Saguenay. The variety of management practices offers the possibility for long term and comparative studies of natural forest dynamics as well as the impact of human, fires and insect disturbances. The large elevational gradient of the region (~1000m) allows study of variations in structure and type of forests.\nDepending on the method used, several factors may degrade the accuracy of canopy height estimates from the combined use of lidar and radar interferometry. Here we will consider misregistration of datasets, differences in spatial resolution and viewing geometry, geometric decorrelation and the vertical wavenumber. Finally we investigate the sensitivity of estimate to forest vertical profile and terrain topography.",

            "abstract": "The Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer (MOMA) investigation on the 2018 ExoMars rover will examine the chemical composition of samples acquired from depths of up to two meters below the martian surface, where organics may be protected from radiative and oxidative degradation. MOMA combines analyses of acquired drill fines via (i) pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) and (ii) Mars ambient laser desorption mass spectrometry (LDMS), enabled by a fast-valve capillary ion inlet system. This “dual source” approach gives MOMA unprecedented breadth of detection over a wide range of molecular weights and volatilities. Analysis of nonvolatile, higher-molecular weight organics such as carboxylic acids and peptides even in the presence of significant perchlorate concentrations is enabled by the extremely short (~1 ns) pulses of the desorption laser. Use of the MOMA ion trap’s tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) mode permits selective focus on key species for isolation and controlled fragmentation, providing structural analysis capabilities. The flight-like engineering test unit (ETU) of MOMA’s ion trap mass spectrometer has been put through a battery of tests to assure robustness of operation in the martian environment, to assess science performance, and to prepare for the flight model build under extremely sterile conditions as required by ExoMars. These tests have included coupling campaigns with advanced prototypes of the MOMA GC (provided by the University of Paris) and the MOMA tapping station, ovens, and laser (provided by MPS and LZH). Planning for science operations has expanded with the development of scripts for MOMA’s various parameterized modes, including MS/MS. Given the limited duration of the baseline mission (218 sols), MOMA will benefit from a thorough characterization of its performance with a variety of Mars analog samples and a careful comparison with current science results from the SAM experiment on MSL. Such preparation will enable efficient use of resources when MOMA analyzes unknown martian samples in conjunction with other ExoMars instruments such as the MicrOmega and Raman spectrometers.",

Capitalizing on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technology for improved access to the nation's precise geodetic elevation infrastructure requires use of a geoid model, which relates GNSS-derived heights (ellipsoid heights) with traditional elevations (orthometric heights). NGS is facilitating the use of crowdsourced GNSS observations collected at published elevation control stations by the professional surveying, geospatial, and scientific communities to help improve NGS' geoid modeling capability. This collocation of published elevation data and newly collected GNSS data integrates together the two height systems. This effort in turn supports enhanced access to accurate elevation information across the nation, thereby benefiting all users of geospatial data.\nBy partnering with the public in this collaborative effort, NGS is not only helping facilitate improvements to the elevation infrastructure for all users but also empowering users of NSRS with the capability to do their own high-accuracy positioning. The educational outreach facet of this effort helps inform the public, including the scientific community, about the utility of various NGS tools, including the widely used Online Positioning User Service (OPUS). OPUS plays a key role in providing user-friendly and high accuracy access to NSRS, with optional sharing of results with NGS and the public.

            "abstract": "Observations indicate that the Arctic sea ice cover is rapidly disappearing while the Antarctic sea ice cover is steadily expanding. State-of-the-art climate models, by contrast, predict that global warming should cause relatively moderate rates of sea ice retreat in both hemispheres. A number of recent studies have suggested that, in the Southern Hemisphere, this discrepancy is the result of the global warming signal being overwhelmed by natural variability which causes the observed expansion. Similarly, other studies have suggested that the rapidly diminishing sea ice in the Northern Hemisphere arises from a global warming signal that is being enhanced by natural variability. We investigate these hypotheses using output from climate model simulations carried out for the two most recent IPCC Assessment Reports (CMIP3 and CMIP5). Separating the simulated sea ice change in each hemisphere into a component associated with global warming and a component associated with natural variability, we quantify the likelihood that the model simulations are consistent with observed sea ice changes in both hemispheres. By placing a probability on the scenario in which neither models nor observations contain a significant deficiency, our results may have direct implications for the uncertainty of future sea ice projections generated using current climate models.",

            "abstract": "Urban water management requires innovative and integrative approaches to improve sustainability in cities keeping in touch with science progress. Integrated Resource Management (IRM) is one of these strategies and has been developed to integrate various natural and human resources. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that it is challenging to move from vision to implementation. The aim of this paper is to identify strengths and weaknesses of IRM and analyze if the approach might facilitate implementation of sustainability objectives in the water management field. A literature review was performed on peer-reviewed papers that were identified through Google Scholar search for the term ‘Integrated Resource Management’. It was found that IRM has been used in a number of contexts such as urban planning, forestry, and management of waste and livestock. Significant implementation challenges are highlighted in the literature. Based on the lessons learned in many different fields, from forestry to communication sciences, important characteristics of IRM approach were found such as the need for adequate governance and strong leaderships, stakeholder’s involvement, the learning process and the critical need of appropriate evaluation criteria. We conclude developing an implementation methodology and presenting several recommendations to implement IRM in urban management. While Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) is recognized as a fruitful approach to achieve sustainable water management, this study suggests that a shift toward Integrated Resource Management (IRM) can be beneficial as it is designed to facilitate consideration of the interrelationships between various natural and human resources.",

            "abstract": "Fog is the cloud of which the base is at the earth surface. Because of severely reduced visibility when fog is present, on-road traffics, maritime transport and aircraft operations are often hampered by fog occurrence. Therefore, accurate prediction of fog has been of high priority in traffic safety. The first step towards the accurate prediction of fog would be to detect the fog formation and monitor the evolution of fog in a continuous manner so that we can better characterize the fog formation mechanism. However, observing the evolution of fog has been difficult due to its nature of local meteorological scale and the lack of proper measurement of such scale. In situ measurements can provide us the most accurate data, but these measurements are limited to a very small spatial coverage. Satellite remote sensing can cover a wider spatial scale but detailed structure cannot be detected, In contrast, ground based remote sensing has advantages in spatial and temporal coverages. Here we present the data measured using a suite of ground based remote sensing instruments at the National Center for Intensive Observation of severe weather (NCIO), located at a southern coastal rural town of Boseong, Korea (34.76 ̊ N, 127.16 ̊ E), which include a scanning Ka-band cloud radar, wind profiler, microwave radiometer, ceilometer and lidar. Analysis of these data will be complemented by the basic meteorological (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction) data measured at 11 different altitudes on a 300m meteorological observation tower installed at NCIO. With the sea to the south, the hilly topographical setting to the north, and the ragged coastal line in between, fog formation mechanisms in this region are expected to be very complex. Our eventual goal is to obtain an insight on the formation mechanisms of the coastal fogs in this region through the analysis of these comprehensive dataset. Some preliminary results from this effort will be presented at the conference.",

            "abstract": "The seismic monitoring is expected to reveal the process of debris flow from the initial area to alluvial fan, because other field monitoring techniques, such as the video camera and the ultrasonic sensor, are limited by detection range. For this reason, seismic approaches have been used as the detection system of debris flows over the past few decades. The analysis of the signatures of the seismic signals in time and frequency domain can be used to identify the different phases of debris flow. This study dedicates to investigate the different stages of seismic signals due to debris flow, including the advanced signal, the main front, and the decaying tail. Moreover, the characteristics of the advanced signals forward to the approach of main front were discussed for the warning purpose. This study presents a permanent system, composed by two seismometers, deployed along the bank of Ai-Yu-Zi Creek in Nantou County, which is one of the active streams with debris flow in Taiwan. The three axes seismometer with frequency response of 7 sec – 200 Hz was developed by the Institute of Earth Sciences (IES), Academia Sinica for the purpose to detect debris flow. The original idea of replacing the geophone system with the seismometer technique was for catching the advanced signals propagating from the upper reach of the stream before debris flow arrival because of the high sensitivity. Besides, the low frequency seismic waves could be also early detected because of the low attenuation. However, for avoiding other unnecessary ambient vibrations, the sensitivity of seismometer should be lower than the general seismometer for detecting teleseism. Three debris flows with different mean velocities were detected in 2013 and 2014. The typical triangular shape was obviously demonstrated in time series data and the spectrograms of the seismic signals from three events. The frequency analysis showed that enormous debris flow bearing huge boulders would induce low frequency seismic waves. Owing to the less attenuation of low frequency waves, advanced signals mainly ranged between 2 and 10 Hz were detected in several minutes prior to the arrival of the main surge of a debris flow. As the results, the prior time of the advanced signals could be used not only to extend the warning time, but also to identify the initial location of a developing debris flow.",

            "abstract": "The effects of aerosols have the largest uncertainty when it comes to predicting the anthropogenic impact with current weather and climate models. The NASA Goddard Cumulus Ensemble model (GCE) with advanced spectral bin microphysics has been used to study the impact of aerosols on deep convective precipitating systems, which contribute more than 50% of the total surface rainfall in the Tropics and for floods and are associated with severe weather events in mid-latitudes. Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) has released its data to the public. High-resolution GCE simulations can be combined with incoming NASA GPM data to provide direct assistance to both retrieval algorithm developers as well as developers of model physics for coarse resolution (i.e., hydrological, regional and global/climate) simulations with more limited computational resources. However, the spectral bin microphysical scheme is very different from previous bulk schemes. It explicitly resolves the particle size distributions using 33 (or more if needed) size bins for each cloud species. This introduces ~400 more prognostic variables. In addition, bin microphysical schemes need to resolve the interactions between these 400 additional variables, making it highly compute as well as I/O intensive. To address those challenges, we have been improving GCE scalability as well as developing a parallel AsyncIO management system consisting of MPI IO, data burst caching and data compression. In this paper, we will present the results of ultra-high resolution (up to 0.125 x 0.125 degree global-model-equivalent resolution) GCE simulations empowered with the parallel AsyncIO management system.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the mass and energy of erupting plasma observed in X-ray and EUV, which are associated with both coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and X-ray flares. Hinode/XRT observed the erupting hot plasma in a few passbands, which allows us to determine the temperature of the plasma using a filter ratio method. SDO/AIA observed the erupting plasma in EUV passbands. We estimate the temperatures and emission measures of the erupting plasma in EUV using a differential emission measure method. One of these observations shows eruptive plasma with a loop-like structure in X-ray and EUV. The temperature of the erupting plasma in X-ray is about 13 MK by the filter ratio method. The estimated mass of this erupting plasma in X-ray is similar to that in EUV. In addition, we estimate the radiative loss, thermal conduction, thermal, and kinetic energies of the eruptive hot plasma in X-rays. We find that the thermal conduction time scale is much shorter than the duration of eruption. This result implies that additional heating during the eruption may be required to explain the hot plasma observations in X-rays. A couple of events are associated with the eruptions of prominences as absorption features in EUV in addition to hot plasma eruption. One event shows that the absorption features change to emission features at the beginning of their eruptions in all EUV wavelengths of SDO/AIA. By estimating the energy budget of the erupting plasmas, we discuss the heating of the plasmas associated with coronal mass ejections in the low corona.",

            "abstract": "A total of two pumiceous layers bounded by sharp upper and lower contacts with surrounding mud were evident in almost all of the 19 sediment cores in southeastern Kyushu, Japan. The upper orange-tinged pumiceous layer A with approx. 5 cm thickness was present at around 2.0–3.5 m deep, while the lower white-tinged pumiceous layer B with a few millimeters to 1.5 cm thickness was found beneath the layer A. The major element composition and refraction index of volcanic glass shards in layers A and B were consistent with those of standard sample of Kr-M and Sz-7, respectively. The Kr-M tephra, sourced from the Mt. Kirishima in southern part of Kyushu, was deposited approx. 4600 years ago, while the Sz-7 tephra, sourced from the Sakurajima in southern part of Kyushu, was deposited approx. 5000 years ago. Selected seeds, leaves, and plant debris obtained from mud samples immediately beneath the layers A and B provided their limiting-maximum ages of approx. 4500 cal. yr BP and 4500–4600 cal. yr BP. The results of the tephra analyses and radiocarbon age indicate that the layer A is the Kr-M fall tephra. However, the limiting-maximum age of the layer B is 400 years younger than the fall age of Sz-7. Given the higher percentage of marine and brackish diatoms than the background mud, deposition of the layer B is thought to be due to a seawater inundation event such as tsunami.\nIt is quite likely that volcaniclastic tsunami deposits exist not only in Kyushu, but also at any site in the subduction zones all over the world. The same approach as this study contributes to the discovery of overlooked tsunami deposits in other areas.",

            "abstract": "A number of recent studies have found evidence for a widening of the earth's tropical belt (Seidel et al). Most studies focus on the annual mean zonal mean tropical belt width. The purpose of this research, however, is to determine the longitudinal variability of the width of the tropical belt. We study how well defined the boundaries of the tropical belt are in both hemispheres as a function of longitude as well as season. The sharpness of the tropical boundaries as a function of longitude can provide information, which is otherwise hidden in the more commonly studied zonal averages. Localized widening of the tropical belt is expected to have a bigger climatic impact for a very sharp tropical boundary encompassing a drastic distinction between the climates of the tropics versus the subtropics. An improved understanding of the morphology of the tropical belt can help us determine any changes regarding these regions surrounding the edges of the tropics. By locating the subtropical tropopause break, a region where the tropopauses’ altitude drastically shifts, the boundaries of the tropical belt can be observed. By finding the gradient of the tropopause break, we can determine the sharpness of the tropical boundaries. It was found that during each hemisphere’s respective summer season the tropical belt edge over the Pacific and Atlantic oceans can display a tendency to be very fickle and thus poorly defined. For all times of the year, however, it is shown that the tropopause break in each hemisphere’s respective winter and over land has the tendency to create a well-defined and sharp tropical edge.",

            "abstract": "An X4.9-class solar flare occurred at approximately 01:00 hours UTC on 25 February 2014 causing widespread dayside blackouts of HF communication and radar, including SuperDARN. Nearly complete disruption persisted for about 10 minutes. The UHF Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR) measured significant plasma density enhancements in the D, E, and lower F regions during the flare event which occurred during PFISR Ion Neutral Observations of the Thermosphere (PINOT) campaign measurements.\nIn this case study, X-ray flux measurements from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-15) were used with the Self Consistent Ionosphere Model (SCIM) to calculate the ionosphere plasma density, temperature, and composition response over Poker Flat, Alaska. Under the assumption that the flare X-ray flux enhancement was confined to GOES-measured X-ray wavelengths between 0.05 and 0.8 nm, the calculated ionosphere plasma density perturbation above Poker Flat was restricted to the D region, contrary to the ISR measurements which in addition showed significant E- and lower F-region electron density enhancements. Incorporating measurements into the model from the GOES-15 and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) extreme ultraviolet (EUV) sensors covering spectral bands between 5 and 36 nm improves the agreement between the modeled electron densities and its measurements but is not entirely sufficient, particularly in upper E and lower F regions.\nIncreasing the model soft X-ray energy flux in the 0.8 to 2.3 nm wavelength band by two orders of magnitude, consistent with TIMED-SEE measurement surveys of previous X-class flares, brings the calculated ionosphere response to good agreement with PFISR measurements. Finally, PFISR measurements made during the 7 January 2014 X1-class solar flare are shown that demonstrate some X-class flares produce only moderate electron density enhancements in the D and lower E regions, but not the upper E and lower F regions. This underscores the need for expanded continuous measurement of solar soft X-ray and EUV flux to adequately model the ionosphere response to X-class solar flares. No continuous measurements of this band are currently available.",

            "abstract": "Zonal wind strength and direction are fundamental components of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and likely play an important role in global temperature modulation. However, historical observations of tropical Pacific winds are limited, and existing datasets disagree on long-term trends, emphasizing the need for independent data to assess zonal wind variability. Earlier work using a 17-year dataset from Tarawa Atoll suggests that Mn/Ca in corals near west-facing lagoons record westerly winds associated with the onset and maintenance of El Niño events. These westerly wind anomalies trigger strong physical mixing and release of Mn from the Mn-enriched lagoonal sediments, which is incorporated into the coral skeleton. Here we present a new ~90 year Mn/Ca record from Tarawa that allows us to assess westerly wind anomalies before the mid-20th century, when instrumental data from the tropical Pacific are scarce. We compare this new Mn/Ca record with 20th-century reanalysis zonal wind and demonstrate a strong association between the frequency of westerly winds and Tarawa Mn/Ca from 1890-1982. This new wind reconstruction also corroborates and extends the idea, developed from models and analyses of the well-observed late 20th century, that periods of strong Pacific trade winds are associated with cooler equatorial Pacific SSTs and a slower rate of global warming, and vice versa. By adding Mn/Ca to the suite of coral tracers measured for paleoclimate reconstructions from appropriate sites, we can expand our view of past climate variability to include westerly winds, along with the more commonly reconstructed variables of SST and salinity. Development of additional Mn/Ca records from other equatorial atolls with westerly facing lagoons will be used to obtain a broader multivariate perspective on the dynamics of recent climate variability.",

            "abstract": "Reverse time migration (RTM) is one of the simplest seismic imaging algorithms to describe: a sum of correlations between forward propagated source wavefields and backward propagated receiver wavefields. To calculate these correlations, we store many wavefield snapshots during their propagation, sometimes as often as once every four time steps. This generates enough data that the snapshots must be written to disk. On modern architectures, we can do the wave propagation quickly on a GPU, but the interface between the GPU and its host CPU in addition to the very slow interface between the CPU and disk acts as a bottleneck in the overall imaging algorithm. \nWe show that the bottleneck when writing to disk can be alleviated by compressing wavefield snapshots on the CPU before writing them to disk. Higher compression ratios can be achieved by the use of lossy compression, so we must balance information lost with reduced data movement time. We compare three strategies of compression: a general data compressor called fpzip, wavelets used in the JPEG 2000 standard, and curvelets, i.e. wavelets designed to fit contours such as wave fronts. Our experiments verify that the losses taken on by compressing wavefields by a significant factor as they are written to disk can be tolerated, presumably because RTM sums up many correlated wavefields which have uncorrelated errors induced by the compression. Our experiments show that lossy compression before writing to disk can reduce the time to produce an image via the RTM algorithm. These results are architecture dependent, so we further provide tools to help other researchers predict the compression timing needs of the RTM workflow on other computers. ",

            "abstract": "Periclase (MgO) is a material of key importance to Earth sciences: it is one of the most abundant minerals in Earth’s lower mantle. It has the simple NaCl structure with no phase transition at least up to 200 GPa and also has very high melting temperatures above 3000 K. These wide stability ranges of MgO cover high-pressure and high-temperature conditions corresponding to the Earth's lower mantle. Therefore, precise knowledge of the thermal elastic properties of MgO, major end-members of constituent mineral phases of the lower mantle, under high pressure and high temperature condition is crucial for constructing the accurate mineralogical model of the Earth's lower mantle. Here we have measured the single-crystal elasticity of MgO using in situ Brillouin spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction at simultaneous high pressure-temperature conditions up to 33 GPa and 900 K in an externally-heated diamond anvil cell. Using the third-order Eulerian finite-strain equations to model the elasticity data, we have derived the aggregate adiabatic bulk, KS0, and shear moduli, G0, at ambient conditions: KS0=162.9 (6) GPa (the value in parentheses represents propagated uncertainties) and G0=130.7 (8) GPa, respectively, consistent with literature results. The pressure derivatives of the bulk and shear moduli at 300K are (∂KS/∂P)T=4.06 (22) and (∂G/∂P)T=2.75(±0.18), respectively, which are also consistent with previous literature results. We also derived the temperature derivatives of these moduli at constant pressure. Our results here provide accurate insights into seismic profiles and mineralogical models of the lower mantle region.",

            "abstract": "The tectonic deformation and geomorphology of the Inner California Borderlands (ICB) records the transition from a convergent plate margin to a predominantly dextral strike-slip system. Geodetic measurements of plate boundary deformation onshore indicate that approximately 15%, or 6-8 mm/yr, of the total Pacific-North American relative plate motion is accommodated by faults offshore. The largest near-shore fault system, the Newport-Inglewood/Rose Canyon (NI/RC) fault complex, has a Holocene slip rate estimate of 1.5-2.0 mm/yr, according to onshore trenching, and current models suggest the potential to produce an Mw 7.0+ earthquake. The fault zone extends approximately 120 km, initiating from the south near downtown San Diego and striking northwards with a constraining bend north of Mt. Soledad in La Jolla and continuing northwestward along the continental shelf, eventually stepping onshore at Newport Beach, California. In late 2013, we completed the first high-resolution 3D seismic survey (3.125 m bins) of the NI/RC fault offshore of San Onofre as part of the Southern California Regional Fault Mapping project. We present new constraints on fault geometry and segmentation of the fault system that may play a role in limiting the extent of future earthquake ruptures. In addition, slip rate estimates using piercing points such as offset channels will be explored. These new observations will allow us to investigate recent deformation and strain transfer along the NI/RC fault system.",

            "abstract": "Similarity scaling predicts that wind induced shear will be the dominant source of turbulence near the air-water interface in lakes with low to moderate wind forcing. Turbulence is expected to be enhanced with wave activity; results are conflicting on the effects of heating and cooling. We measured turbulence with an acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) and / or a temperature-gradient microstructure profiler and obtained correlative time series measurements of meteorology and water column temperature in a 800 m2 arctic pond, a 1 ha boreal lake, and a large tropical reservoir. Turbulence measurements with both instruments corroborated those calculated from similarity scaling in the boreal lake. Within the arctic pond, dissipation rates obtained with the ADV were in agreement with those from similarity scaling when winds exceeded ~1.5 m/s with a greater frequency of measurable dissipation rates when surface waves were present. Dissipation rates in the tropical reservoir reached and often exceeded 10‑6 m2 s-3 in the upper meter under light winds and decreased by an order of magnitude with cooling or rainfall. Under cooling, dissipation rates were at least an order of magnitude higher in the uppermost 25 cm bin than in the water column below. Gas transfer coefficients calculated from concurrent measurements of greenhouse gas fluxes with floating chambers and the surface renewal model using the estimates of turbulence were in agreement. These results support the predictions of Monin-Obuhov similarity scaling in that shear dominates turbulence production near the air-water interface under heating and cooling, illustrate spatial variability in turbulence production in small water bodies due to the intermittency of wind interacting with the water’s surface, are in agreement with prior oceanic observations that shear and associated turbulence can be intensified in shallow mixing layers under heating with light winds, and illustrate the utility of similarity scaling for predicting gas transfer coefficients.",

On the basis of forest inventory data and spatial distribution of forest stand age and forest type, we developed an approach for estimating yearly China’s forest biomass carbon stocks change. Using this approach, we estimated the changes of forest carbon stock due to management practice and forest age structure change, respectively, and predicted China’s future carbon potential based on national forest expansion plan. We also discussed sustainable harvesting intensity for the expanded forest of 2020. The spatial pattern of forest biomass carbon density in 2001 showed high in southwestern and northeastern areas, and low in the other regions, meanwhile the high C sinks appeared in the southwestern and northeastern young-aged forests and low in the southwestern and northeastern old-aged forests. The total forest biomass C stock of China increased from 6.06 Pg C in 2001 to 7.88 Pg C in 2013, giving a total increase of 1.82 Pg C, in which 0.45 Pg C is caused by forest expansion. The average C sink during 2002-2013 was 151.83 Tg C, in which 75.5% is the results of forest growth and 24.5% is caused by forest expansion. With the assumption of China’s forest area will expand by 40 million hectares from 2006 to 2020, the forest C stock in 2020 is predicted as 9.04 Pg C. Harvesting intensity experiments conducted on the expanded forest of 2020 shown higher harvesting level will lead to decline in forest biomass in long term. The harvesting level of 2% is an optimal harvesting intensity for sustainable development of China’s forest resources.",

Roosevelt and Ross Islands are thought to be key stabilization anchors for the Ross Ice Shelf and thus the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.\nAs part of the Roosevelt Island Climate Evolution (RICE) project, a 763m deep ice core was recovered during 2011-2013 from Roosevelt Island, at the northern edge of the Ross Ice Shelf. The ice at Roosevelt Island is grounded 210m below sea level and accumulates in situ, with the Ross Ice Shelf flowing around the rise. High resolution radar surveys show a well developed Raymond Bump at the divide of the ice dome. With the conclusion of the RICE core processing campaign in July 2014, a preliminary age model is developed using annual layer count, volcanic ash layers; and high resolution methane data tied to the WAIS Divide ice core record, and a glacial flow model.\nHere we show preliminary data spanning over 100 ka including evidence of ice from the Eemian period (MIS 5e) at the base of the core. The presence of Eemian ice in the RICE record raises the question: how much of the Ross Ice Shelf and West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapsed during the last interglacial, when global sea level was 4-8m higher than today? We discuss reconstructions of sea surface and air temperature, sea ice extent, atmospheric circulation patterns, and ice shelf retreat. An ensemble of sensitivity modelling experiments is used to determine thresholds for the removal of ice on Roosevelt Island and correlated grounding line and ice volume changes of the Ross Ice Shelf and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.",

            "abstract": "When estimating surface water-groundwater fluxes, the use of complimentary techniques helps to fill in uncertainties in any individual method, and to potentially gain a better understanding of spatial and temporal variability in a system. It can also be a way of preventing the loss of data during infrequent and unpredictable flow events. For example, much of arid Australia relies on groundwater, which is recharged by streamflow through ephemeral streams during flood events. Three recent surface water/groundwater investigations from arid Australian systems provide good examples of how using multiple field and analysis techniques can help to more fully characterize surface water-groundwater fluxes, but can also result in conflicting values over varying spatial and temporal scales. In the Pilbara region of Western Australia, combining streambed radon measurements, vertical heat transport modeling, and a tracer test helped constrain very low streambed residence times, which are on the order of minutes. Spatial and temporal variability between the methods yielded hyporheic exchange estimates between 10-4 m2 s-1 and 4.2 x 10-2 m2 s-1.  In South Australia, three-dimensional heat transport modeling captured heterogeneity within 20 square meters of streambed, identifying areas of sandy soil (flux rates of up to 3 m d-1) and clay (flux rates too slow to be accurately characterized). Streamflow front modeling showed similar flux rates, but averaged over 100 m long stream segments for a 1.6 km reach. Finally, in central Australia, several methods are used to decipher whether any of the flow down a highly ephemeral river contributes to regional groundwater recharge, showing that evaporation and evapotranspiration likely accounts for all of the infiltration into the perched aquifer. Lessons learned from these examples demonstrate the influences of the spatial and temporal variability between techniques on estimated fluxes.",

Over the past decades, various direct and indirect measurement methods have been developed and widely-applied, however, high-quality time-series site-level data are still scarce. This study presents a method to estimate temporal LAI based on in-situ albedo observations using a forest radiative transfer (FRT) model. The estimation of LAI from FRT model inversion is based on a look-up table (LUT) approach. We first simulate diurnal blue-sky albedos to build the LUT by sampling the space of the FRT input variables. Then, to select the feasible solutions from the LUT, the simulated diurnal albedo in LUT are compared to measured data for each day, and a semi-mechanistic LAI dynamics model is served as a temporal constraint for the entire growth season. We also define and provide uncertainties of model inversion. Finally, estimated LAI time-series are compared to multi-year field measurements. We expect this method can be applied for the sites where continuous albedo data are available.",

            "abstract": "The concentration of bubbles, crystals or droplets into small volumes of magma is a key trigger for many interesting magmatic processes. For example, gas slugs driving Strombolian eruptions form from the coalesence of exsolved bubbles within a volcanic conduit, while Ni-Cu-PGE magmatic sulfide deposits require a concentration of dense sulfide droplets from a large volume of magma to form a massive ore body. However the physical mechanism for this clustering remains unresolved - especially since small particles in active magma flows are expected to mostly track flow streamlines rather than clustering.\nWe have uncovered a previously unreported clustering mechanism which is applicable to magmatic flows. This mechanism involves the interaction of particles with two kinds of chaotic flow structure: (a) high-strain regions within the well-mixed chaotic zones of the flow, and (b) unmixed islands of stability within the chaotic flow, known as Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) regions. The first figure shows the difference between chaotic and KAM regions in a chaotic laminar pipe flow.\nTrapping occurs when particles are scattered from high-strain regions in the chaotic zones and become trapped in the KAM regions, leading to a rapid concentration of particles relative to their original distribution (shown in the second series of figures). Using a combination of these analogue experiments and theoretical analysis we outline the conditions under which this clustering process can occur. We examine the onset of secondary density-related instabilities and the effects of increased particle-particle interaction within the clustered particles, and highlight the impact of particle clustering on the dynamics of magma ascent and emplacement.",

Thus it is necessary to fully evaluate the collection 6 products for applications that require high quality MODIS aerosol optical depth data, such as operational aerosol data assimilation.\nThe uncertainties in the MODIS c6 DT over ocean products are studied through both inter-comparing with the Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) aerosol products and by evaluation against ground truth. Special attention is given to the low bias in MODIS DT products due to the misclassifications of heavy aerosol plumes as clouds.

            "abstract": "Urbanization presents challenging water resource problems for communities worldwide. The hydromodifications associated with urbanization results in increased runoff rates and volumes and increased peak flows. These hydrologic changes can lead to increased erosion and stream destabilization, decreased evapotranspiration, decreased ground water recharge, increases in pollutant loading, and localized anthropogenic climate change or Urban Heat Islands. Stormwater represents a complex and dynamic component of the urban water cycle that requires careful mitigation. With the implementation of Phase II rules under the CWA, stormwater management is shifting from a drainage-efficiency focus to a natural systems focus. The natural system focus, referred to as Low Impact Development (LID), or Green Infrastructure, uses best management practices (BMPs) to reduce the impacts caused by urbanization hydromodification. Large-scale patterns of stormwater runoff from urban environments are complex and it is unclear what the large-scale impacts of green infrastructure are on the water cycle. High resolution physically based hydrologic models can be used to more accurately simulate the urban hydrologic cycle. These types of models tend to be more dynamic and allow for greater flexibility in evaluating and accounting for various hydrologic processes in the urban environment that may be lost with lower resolution conceptual models. We propose to evaluate the effectiveness of high resolution models to accurately represent and determine the urban hydrologic cycle with the overall goal of being able to accurately assess the impacts of LID BMPs in urban environments. We propose to complete a rigorous model intercomparison between ParFlow and FLO-2D. Both of these models can be scaled to higher resolutions, allow for rainfall to be spatially and temporally input, and solve the shallow water equations. Each model is different in the way it accounts for infiltration, initial abstraction losses, and urban structures. The intercomparison of these models will help identify key areas of urban hydrology that can be used by agencies in developing design guidelines used in assessing LIDs in urban environments.",

A few existing sea surface temperature (SST) records from the Western Pacific warm pool and South China Sea, at a low resolution, suggest warmer SSTs during this epoch. However, the magnitude of the warmth, as compared to modern conditions, as well as the temperature fluctuations within this period, remains largely elusive. In this study, we reconstruct biomarker-based high-resolution SST records during the late Miocene-Pliocene period from a sediment core retrieved from the Qiongzhou Strait, northern South China Sea. The records reveal the details of the SST variability over this period. Within the late Miocene-Pliocene, a few notable relatively cooling periods at 4.3 Ma, 5.5 Ma, could be identified, which appear to correspond to global benthic d18O changes. Overall, our results suggest that SSTs was indeed warmer than today and that the SST fluctuations within this period was probably modulated by orbital changes.",

            "abstract": "Isoprene epoxydiol (IEPOX) has recently been identified as a key intermediate in the photooxidation of isoprene under low-NO conditions and in the formation of isoprene-derived secondary organic aerosol (SOA). IEPOX is generally expected to react with OH in the gas phase, where it has been found to form predominantly C4O3H8 products, or undergo reactive uptake onto particles, where it is converted into 2-methyltetrols or organosulfates by acid- or ammonium-catalyzed mechanisms. The subsequent chemistry of these gas- and particle-phase products has not yet been explored. Using synthetic standards of IEPOX and its gas-phase products, we have performed environmental chamber and flow tube experiments to investigate the fate of IEPOX in both the gas and particle phases. To explore the gas-phase chemistry of IEPOX, three potential isomers of the C4O3H8 products were synthesized and photooxidized by exposure to OH. Detection with CF3O- chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) allowed for determination of their oxidation rates, fractional yields from IEPOX oxidation, and major products. To explore the photooxidation of IEPOX-derived SOA, synthetic IEPOX was reacted with various salts and atomized into a flow tube, where it was photooxidized by exposure to OH. We will present results showing changes in gas- and particle-phase chemical composition, monitored during oxidation by CIMS and aerosol mass spectrometry, including their dependence on both seed particle composition and OH concentration. Preliminary data show that the photochemical loss of IEPOX-derived SOA mass may be an important consideration for predicting aerosol loading and gas phase oxidative chemistry in isoprene-rich environments.",

            "abstract": "King’s Bowl (KB), located in Idaho’s eastern Snake River Plain, was formed by a phreatic blast through a mostly-congealed lava lake. Blocks up to ~2m diameter were ejected from the vent to form a ballistic ejecta blanket extending radially more than 100m. The blocks on the western side of the KB fissure are extraordinarily well exposed, as the fine fraction was blown eastward by ambient winds during the explosion. We present preliminary modeling results using the western ballistic blocks of KB to calculate the energy of the eruption, and the water volume necessary to create the blast. This work is presented in conjunction with two other 2014 AGU conference abstracts submitted by NASA SSERVI funded FINESSE (Field Investigations to Enable Solar System Science and Exploration) team members: Hughes et al., which introduces the geology of KB and Sears et al., which discusses field observation and data trends. Results of this research are extensible to steam-driven pits on other solar system bodies, including those observed on Mars, Phobos, Deimos, and the asteroids.\nOver 600 blocks ranging from .2 to 2m in diameter were mapped using differential GPS and measured for 3 axial lengths and vesicularity. Mass calculations were corrected using a scaling factor determined from measurements of 100 blocks at KB, coupled with targeted density measurements. The dispersed block trajectories were modeled using a fourth order Runge-Kutta solution of the equations of motion to calculate suites of possible ejection speeds and angles. The resulting characteristic vent velocities were used to calculate the kinetic energy necessary to evacuate the crater at KB; energy required for fragmentation is neglected at this time. Total mass in the kinetic energy calculations was calculated by two separate methods: 1) current volume expression of the KB crater and 2) an additive solution of the ejecta field as determined from radial transect surveys. From the kinetic energy we calculated the pressure behind the eruption, leading to the quantity of water required to create the phreatic blast.",

            "abstract": "Humans have manipulated much of the global land surface, the signature of which accelerated rapidly with the growth of global population over the last ~100 years. Only a modest part of the global land surface is now free of human effects, much of which have been for agriculture and pasture, and to a lesser extent human habitation in urban areas. These land surface changes have in turn affected the land surface water cycle, mostly via enhanced evapotranspiration from that portion of the agricultural area that is irrigated, and from storage of river runoff in reservoirs that provide most of the irrigation water. I evaluate the signature of these perturbations on the land surface water balance on a continent by continent basis, and for selected major river basins. I further evaluate the effect of anthropogenic perturbations in terms of their interseasonal and interannual magnitudes of variation relative to other terms in the land surface water cycle, including precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, and storage change associated with snow and soil moisture. I also evaluate the anthropogenic changes to date relative to projected changes over the next century associated with a warming climate as inferred from IPCC AR5 model output for selected large river basins.",

            "abstract": "Web-based agricultural management software allows for the delivery of previously hard to access soil, weather and remotely sensed data to growers. While access to these data sources is beneficial, growers can realize large gains by leveraging field level data and integrating decision support tools that have been presented in the literature. Using a previously developed model for estimating the growth stage of maize (Sakamoto et al. 2010), we examine how remotely sensed data can be integrated into a web-based agricultural management tool, informing grower management decisions by providing near real-time estimates of crop growth stage and sub-field level variability in growing conditions. When combined with field-level soil and weather data, growers can use remote sensing based models to tailor management activities, taking variable (climate related) and invariant (site characteristic) yield determining factors into account.\nTime series of Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI) derived from Landsat observations were linked to 97 fields growing maize across the Mid-western region of the United States in 2013. Crop growth stage day of year (DOY) estimates (V2.5, R1, R5, and R6) were predicted for each field based on the WDRVI profile and compared to a growing degree day based estimate. These estimates aid in scheduling growth stage specific management activities and allow farmers to more efficiently monitor geographically remote fields. Within-field variation in growing conditions is presented on an ordinal scale (below average, average, above average) based on the field-level distribution of WDRVI values at each observation. Monitoring of sub-field level conditions allows growers to calibrate field-level yield estimates, prioritize field scouting activities and plan targeted interventions. Integration of these tools into existing web-based agricultural management tools allows growers to easily incorporate remotely sensed data into their decision making process, facilitating the exchange of information between researchers and practitioners.",

            "abstract": "The coarse resolution of GCM outputs cannot match the high resolution input requirement of hydrological models and thus are inappropriate for impact assessment of climate change. Though numerous downscaling techniques have been used to gap the mismatch, the methods based on single site cannot be used by the distributed hydrological models for hydrological extreme simulation since the flood in one subbasin can be offset by the adjacent ones due to the ignorance of multi-site spatiotemporal correlation of meteorological variables. This study developed a multi-site downscaling method based on a two-stage weather generator (TSWG) through three steps: (i) spatially downscaling GCMs with a transfer function method; (ii) temporally downscaling GCMs with a single-site weather generator; (iii) reconstructing the spatiotemporal correlations with a post-processing and nonparametric shuffle procedure. Five GCMs (CanESM2, CSIRO_3.6.0, GFDL_CM3, HadGEM2-AO and MPI-ESM-LR) under four RCPs (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) were used to generate climate scenarios for the period of 2011-2040. The hydrological simulation was carried out by SWAT in the Jing River catchment on the Loess Plateau. Future annual mean precipitation would change by -7.7% to 9.2%, annual mean maximum and minimum temperature would increase by 1.4-1.8 ℃ and 1.1-1.4 ℃, respectively. Overall, future climate tended to be warmer and drier under most GCMs and RCPs, and this trend would be more significant for flood season; however, the variations of monthly precipitation would be greater than present. The annual mean streamflow would change by -18% to 38% and be more variable. The monthly streamflow would be more variable for most months due to the increase of monthly maximum streamflow and decrease of monthly minimum streamflow. Therefore, the stremflow in the Jing River should be paid more attention for its possible disasters. The multi-site downscaling method proposed in this study is efficient and performs well for its spatiotemporal correlation reconstruction and hydrological variability simulation, which provides a powerful tool for impact assessment of climate changes.",

            "abstract": "Global warming may destabilize the carbon pool in northern peatlands but it remains uncertain how climatic patterns regulate the transformation of solid-phase peat into greenhouse gases. Here we present a 43-year record of changes in the pore water chemistry from a major peat basin in northern Minnesota. These data indicate that methane production and its transient storage within bogs and fens is finely tuned to climatically driven flow systems on multiple time scales. The peak zones for methanogenesis were apparently limited to the uppermost peat strata during a dry climatic period (1965-1983) when shallow recharge systems prevailed across the GLAP. The shift to a moister climate after 1990 strengthened downward transport systems across the region greatly expanding the vertical suppy of labile root exudates and the peak production zones for methanogenesis in peat profiles. Large methane pools accumulated within the GLAP from 1990 through 2008. Dissolved methane concentrations were 2-to-4 times greater within the deeper peat (1-4 m) than above and were generally higher within bog landforms than in sedge fens. The size of these methane pools varied in response to seasonal and interannual climatic oscillations that apparently affected emission rates via ebullition (from deep peat) and wicking through plant stoma (from the rhizosphere). However, methane pools remained relatively stable during this period, except for a large change between 1990 and 1991. One remaining element of uncertainty concerns the transformation of dissolved methane to free-phase bubbles, which can represent 10-20% of peat volume in the GLAP. Nevertheless, methane profiles from the GLAP indicate that the entire peat profile can function as an incubator for methane depending on the prevailing climate regime and downward transport of labile carbon substrates.",

This is particularly true of platforms built for the Internet of Things (IoT). These enterprise-scale platforms have been designed to exploit the IP-connectivity of sensors and actuators, providing a robust means by which to route real-time data feeds and respond to events of interest. While powerful and scalable, these platforms have yet to be adopted by the hydrologic community, where the value of real-time data impacts both scientists and decision makers. We discuss the use of one such IoT platform for the purpose of large-scale hydrologic measurements, showing how rapid deployment and ease-of-use allows scientists to focus on their experiment rather than software development. The platform is hardware agnostic, requiring only IP-connectivity of field devices to capture, store, process, and visualize data in real-time. We demonstrate the benefits of real-time data through a real-world use case by showing how our architecture enables the remote control of sensor nodes, thereby permitting the nodes to adaptively change sampling strategies to capture major hydrologic events of interest.",

Here, we present a phylogenetic analysis of flowering phenology across an elevational gradient in the Canadian subarctic. We show that the timing of first flower is best explained by a combination of snowmelt, elevation and growing degree days. However, we also show that early flowering species have lower intraspecific variability in their response to climate cues in comparison with late flowering species. Previous work has suggested that early flowering species are more variable in their phenology, but these studies have mostly examined variation in phenology over time, whereas we examined variation in phenology over space. We suggest that both patterns can be explained by the tighter coupling between phenology and climate cues for early flowering species. Thus variability in first flower between seasons over several years demonstrates an opposite trend to variability in first flower over a single growing season, but the underlying mechanisms are the same. Early flowering species have low intraspecific variance in flowering times within a single growing season as individuals respond more uniformly to a common set of cues in comparison to late flowering species. These same species may show large variance between years reflecting interannual variation in climate.",

This tropical region also influenced by many regional and local climate and weather phenomenon which causes high spatial and temporal rainfall variability. These factors may produce unique variability of isotopic precipitation. The isotopic content (d18O and dD) in precipitation have been known to have important role for reconstructing the atmospheric circulation, hydrological cycle, and paleoclimate.\nUsing daily data from six observation station across the IMC (Bukit tinggi, Jambi, Denpasar, Makasar, Manado, and Palau Island), the variability of δ18O was explored. Observation times for each station were different. Bukit Tinggi (GAW) was from Jan. 2001 – Mar. 2010, Jambi (JMB) was from Apr. 2001 – Dec. 2005, Denpasar (DPS), Makassar (MKS), Manado (MND) were from Nov. 2002 – Mar. 2010, and Palau Island (PLL) was from Dec. 2001 – May 2007. Daily average value of δ18O were -7.57‰, -5.41‰, -3.15‰, -6.12‰, -5.49‰ and -4.26‰ for GAW, JMB, DPS, MKS, MND and PLL respectively. Daily value of δ18O in GAW has the lowest value compare with the other station was because the location of GAW station located at high altitude.\nHigh correlation of variability of δ18O and Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) was observed at western part of the IMC (GAW and JMB), and northern part of the IMC (MKS, MND, and PLL), meanwhile δ18O variability at DPS was less correlated with MJO compare with other stations.\nPreliminary result from Color Moisture Analysis (CMA) model revealed that precipitable water at GAW and JMB stations was mostly occupied by water vapor evaporated from the Indian Ocean. However, precipitable water at other stations was mostly composed of water vapor evaporated from the Java Sea and the Pacific Ocean. These findings indicate that water vapor evaporated from the Indian Ocean related to the MJO can only reach the Island of Sumatra in the western part of the IMC. Then, Indian Ocean origin was replaced by the water vapor evaporated from the Java Sea and the Pacific Ocean.",

This seismic station will explore the Martian ambient noise, in addition to more classical science goals related to the detection of Marsquakes, Meteoritic Impacts and Tides.\nMars, in contrast with the Earth (with both atmosphere and ocean) and the Moon (with no atmosphere nor ocean) is expected to have ambient noise only related to its atmosphere. Mars seismic data are therefore expecting to reveal the atmospheric coupling for a different atmospheric dynamics than Earth, especially in the 0.1-1 Hz bandwidth, dominated by oceanic microseisms on Earth.\nWe rapidly present the expected performances of the SEIS experiment onboard InSight. This experiment is based on two 3 axis seismometers, one covering the tide and low seismic frequencies (up to 10 Hz) and a second one covering the high frequencies (from 0.1 Hz to 50 Hz). Both sensors are mounted on a sensors plateform, deployed by a robotic arm 1-2 meters from the lander and covered by thermal protection and a wind protection. The expected performances indicates that signal as low as 10**(-9) m/s**2/Hz**(1/2) will be detected in the 0.005-2 Hz bandwidth.\nWe then focus on the modeling of this ambient atmospheric noise.This modeling has been done not only from constraints gathered by the atmospheric sensors of previous Mars missions (e.g. Viking and Pathfinder) but also by numerical modeling of the atmospheric perturbations, both at global scale and mesoscale. Theoretical estimation of the ambient noise has then been obtained for the pressure-correlated surface loading and the stochastic excitation of surface waves, at both long and very long period (e.g. Mars hum) and at medium or short period (e.g. regional and local generated surface waves). Results shows that most of these source of ambient noise will be detected, likely during the day for those generated locally and possibly during the night for those of global origin.",

            "abstract": "A major problem in earth surface process and hazards research is we have little to no knowledge of precisely where and when the next significant event may occur. This makes it nearly impossible to set up adequate instrumentation and observation ahead of time. Furthermore, it is not practical to overcome this challenge by instrumenting and observing everywhere all the time. We can’t be everywhere and see everything. Remote sensing helps us to fill that gap with missions such as Landsat and WorldView2 offering regular global coverage. However, remote sensing systems for global monitoring have several inherent compromises. Tradeoffs must be made between data storage, processing capacity, spatial resolution, spectral resolution, and temporal resolution. Additionally, instruments and systems must be designed in advance and from a generalized standpoint to serve as many purposes as possible, often at the expense of high performance in specific tasks.\nBecause of these practical constraints, when using remote sensing data to study earth surface processes it is critical to maximize signal content or information obtained from all available data. Several approaches, including multi-temporal data fusion, multi-sensor data fusion, and fusion with derivative products such as band ratios or vegetation indices can help expand how much information can be extracted from remote sensing acquisitions. Fused dataset results contain more coherent information than the sum of their individual constituents. Examples using Landsat and WorldView2 data in this study show this added information makes it possible to map earth surface processes and events, such as the 2011 Cinque Terre landslides, in a more automated and repeatable fashion over larger areas than is possible with manual imagery analysis techniques and with greater chance of successful detection.",

            "abstract": "Refining available estimates of the amount, distribution and alignment of serpentinite in the forearc wedge is needed to develop a better understanding of the seismic anisotropy, strength and fluid transport in this region. Mantle dominantly consists of olivine. However, petrological studies and thermal modeling of convergent margins predict that olivine will be replaced by hydrous mineral phases in fluid-rich and relatively cold forearc mantle. The dominant hydrous mineral will be antigorite. Lower seismic velocities (Vp < ~8 km/s and Vs < ~4 km/s) and higher Vp/Vs values (> ~1.8) of serpentine minerals than those of olivine are commonly used as to detect the distribution of antigorite and estimate its proportion compared to olivine.\nHowever, antigorite is highly anisotropic and this anisotropy can disguise the presence of antigorite in seismic tomography; the apparent Vp/Vs ratio of antigorite can vary from 1.2–3.4 (Vp = 5.6–8.9 km/s and Vs = 2.5–5.1 km/s) depending on the propagation path of the seismic wave relative to the crystal orientation. Here, we take advantage of this anisotropy and perform an analysis of seismic anisotropy that takes into account ray path measured above the forearc mantle of the Rykuyu arc subduction zone. The measured shear wave splitting delay time above this subduction zone is very large, suggesting the presence of aligned antigorite.\nComparing the results of modeling to observed shear wave splitting for both local-S and teleseismic SKS phases, we conclude that the mantle wedge consists of 65 % antigorite and that the antigorite must be aligned along the subducting slab in the deepest part of the wedge but aligned vertically at intermediate depths. This distribution of different orientations strongly suggests the presence of convective mantle flow in the forearc mantle. Physical modeling of the dynamics of the mantle wedge shows that a bulk long-term viscosity of less than 1019 Pa s is required to maintain this large-scale flow.\nThis analysis reveals the presence of otherwise invisible antigorite bearing domains, allows an estimate of the volume percent of serpentinite in the forearc mantle to be made and indicates the pattern of large scale induced flow in this domain.",

            "abstract": "In deep-sea environments, hemipelagites/pelagites and episodic-event deposits are formed from fall out of fine-grained suspensions and from sediment-gravity flows represented by turbidity currents, respectively. In addition, contourites are also formed from bottom currents along the slope. Bottom currents are one of the major processes for the sediment transportation and deposition in deep-sea environments, and are affected by local and global factors such as climate, sea level and tectonics. Therefore, it is important to discriminate the contourites from deep-sea sediments and to clarify their spatial and temporal distribution patterns to reconstruct fluctuations of bottom currents controlled under other factors. In general, major sedimentary facies contourite are characterized by bioturbated mottled facies and bi-gradational grading. However, it is difficult to discriminate muddy contourites from hemipelagites based only on the facies. Therefore, this study focuses on the microstructure of muddy contourites, which would be an additional characteristic/ diagnostic to identify muddy contourites. This study muddy contourites collected from 6 sites are analysed mainly in the Gulf of Cadiz by IODP Expedition 339 (Mediterranean Outflow). In addition, hemipelagites collected from off the west Iberian margin were also examined. Each studied sediments were sub-sampled from the core samples using 7 cc plastic cubes generally used for paleomagnetic analysis. Mean-grain size of the samples was 7.9–25.2 μm, and major mineral components were illite, calcite, and quartz. Most of the samples were wet condition, thus these were dried for SEM observations using a t-butyl alcohol replacing method, which allow us to prepare dried sample without deformation of microstructure. Then the microstructures of the samples were observed using a SEM (JEOL JSM-6390LV). As a result, it is recognized that hemipelagites are composed mainly by calcareous nannoplankton with random orientation of silt grains. In contrast, muddy contourites are characterized by silt grains with plate-like silt parallel or sub-parallel to the bedding plane, with less bioturbation than hemipelagites. These features in the muddy contourite are attributed to the effect of weak and steady bottom current.",

The stable isotopes of water, HDO and H2O18, are included in the present study.\nThe deviation of the isotopic content from linear theory predictions is studied, following Galewsky (2009, doi:10.1130/G30008A.1). The main focus, however, is on the response of orographic precipitation to aerosols and the impact of this response on the isotopic content of the precipitation. Changes in the prescribed cloud droplet number concentration are used as a proxy for changes in background aerosol concentrations. Elevated droplet concentrations lead to a decrease in precipitation over the mountain barrier and a shift of precipitation towards the lee side. In addition, the precipitation over the mountain itself becomes more depleted at some locations.",

Both its north and west margins are of typical passivity.\nSome records mirroring a Cretaceous active margin were reported in the study area. Generally they were attributed to westward subduction from the fossil Pacific plate. With respect of the problem, however, whether the subduction may induce response of an area far from the Pacific margin is an open question.\nThe present approach has been primitively undertaken with the comparison of magmatic formation between the proto-SCS and the Pacific. The adakitic granite and Mg-rich andesite collected from the southern Hainan Island have their own petrologic and chemical characters as distinct from those igneous rocks from Zhejiang-Fujian province just bordering the western Pacific. Interestingly, the characters displayed in the Hainan are repeated in the Nha Trang-Tuy hoa area, South Vietnam.\nAccording to Tapponier’s model (1986), Indo-China block was SE-ward slid 500-700km along the Red River Fault since the late Eocene. If restoring it, the Nha Trang-Tuy hoa area should be on the line extended westward from the Hainan Island. The above two sites constitute a latitudinal zone representing the active margin of the proto-SCS differing from the Pacific system.\nActually some elements can be concentrated as follows to illustrate the framework in the northern margin of the SCS (fig. 1): (1) the late Jurassic to late Cretaceous volcano-sedimentary sequence drilled from the Chaoshan depression 150 mile off the Pearl River Delta, accumulating in the fore-arc environment, (2) the arc-related granite, diorite and monzodiorite (118-72Ma) drilled from the northern continental shelf, the SCS, (3) the Cretaceous andesite, andesitic basalt, granite, and pyroclastic sediments, afore-said, outcropping both in Hainan and South Vietnam, (4) granite-gneiss (75Ma) drilled in the Xisha foundation of reef platform, which might be the output of SubFac, and (5) the Cretaceous volcano-sedimentary sequences representing back-arc rifting and outcropping in the Nanxiong and Hengyang basins, South China.\nThe above pattern portrays an active margin characterized by subducting northward to the Asian land and disappearing at the end of the Mesozoic, which should be a part of the Tethyan archipelago.",

Conversely, recent historical records of 140 years revealed that the relationship between Indian Monsoon and ENSO has broken down (Kumar et al., 1999). Indian Monsoon rainfall variability on decadal time scale was reconstructed by using seawater oxygen isotopes (d18Ow) estimated from oxygen isotopes and Mg/Ca ratios of Globigerinoides ruber from a sediment core in the Bay of Bengal. A comparison of Indian Monsoon rainfall variability on decadal time scale with the number of ENSO events over last 2000 years reveals an inverse relationship between the monsoon rainfall in the Indian Subcontinent and ENSO Events. Furthermore, d18Ow variations reveal increased monsoon rainfall during Roman Warm Period (RWP) and Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and larger monsoon rainfall fluctuations during the Little Ice Age (LIA). Therefore, our study suggests that on decadal time scale ENSO affects the Indian Monsoon Rainfall through the stronger Walker Circulation and associated tropical convection process.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic flux ropes have been observed even in unmagnetized planets' ionosphere, such as Venus and Mars. In the case of Mars, the origin of Martian flux ropes is owing to not only the interplanetary magnetic field and associated draped magnetic fields, but also crustal magnetic fields. Planetary ions are energized through the direct interaction of the solar wind with the upper atmosphere, resulting in ion escape into interplanetary space. Hence magnetic flux ropes can contribute to the ion escape rates, because they may confine large amounts of ionospheric plasma.\nHere, we investigated formation processes of Martian magnetic flux ropes observed downstream from strong crustal magnetic fields in the southern hemisphere based on the Grad-Shafranov reconstruction (GSR) technique. The GSR technique can provide a two-dimensional axial magnetic field map as well as flux ropes axial orientation from single spacecraft data under assumptions that the structure is magneto-hydrostatic and time-independent. We reconstructed the 297 magnetic flux ropes from Mars Global Surveyor measurements between April 1999 and November 2006.\nBased on characteristics of their geometrical axial orientation and transverse magnetic field topology, we found that they can be mainly distinguished according to whether draped interplanetary magnetic fields overlaying on the crustal magnetic fields are involved or not. For approximately two-thirds of the events, they can be formed by magnetic reconnection between neighboring crustal magnetic fields attached to the surface. For the remaining events, however, magnetic reconnection between the crustal and overlaid draping magnetic fields seems to be necessary. Since the overlaid draping magnetic field connects to interplanetary space, planetary ions included inside those flux ropes can be easy to escape from Mars. We also quantitatively evaluate lower limits on potential ion escape rates from Mars owing to the magnetic flux ropes based on the GSR results, and discuss the contribution of magnetic flux ropes to the ion escape rate from Mars.",

            "abstract": "In the past, cost benefit analysis (CBA) has been viewed as an effective means of evaluating water utility strategies, particularly those that were dependent on the construction of new supply infrastructure. As water utilities have begun to embrace ‘soft-path’ approaches as a way to reduce the need for supply-centric development, CBA fails to recognize some important financial incentives affected by reduced water consumption. Demand management, both as a short-term response to drought and in longer-term actions to accommodate demand growth, can introduce revenue risks that adversely affect a utility’s ability to repay debt, re-invest in aging infrastructure, or maintain reserve funds for use in a short-term emergency. A utility that does not generate sufficient revenue to support these functions may be subject to credit rating downgrades, which in turn affect the interest rate it pays on its debt. Interest rates are a critical consideration for utility managers in the capital-intensive water sector, where debt payments for infrastructure often account for a large portion of a utility’s overall costs. Even a small increase in interest rates can add millions of dollars to the cost of new infrastructure. Recent studies have demonstrated that demand management techniques can lead to significant revenue variability, and credit rating agencies have begun to take notice of drought response plans when evaluating water utility credit ratings, providing utilities with a disincentive to fully embrace soft-path approaches. This analysis examines the impact of demand management schemes on key credit rating metrics for a water utility in Raleigh, North Carolina. The utility’s consumer base is currently experiencing rapid population growth, and demand management has the potential to reduce the dependence on costly new supply infrastructure but could lead to financial instability that will significantly increase the costs of financing future projects. This work analyzes how ‘soft-path’ approaches might be more efficiently integrated with investment in supply-side infrastructure and suggests how financial hedging tools could be used to improve long-term utility planning objectives.",

Stripmap-mode HH-polarized TanDEM-X bistatic data (with resolution at 3 m) acquired at different baselines was used. LVIS data was applied to remove the ground phase component of the TanDEM-X interferogram and to validate the derived results. Forest parameters, e.g. canopy height and extinction coefficient were estimated based on Random Volume over Ground (RVoG) model. Scattering phase height (SPH) was also calculated and validated against LVIS rh100. A clear correlation was observed between TanDEM-X SPH and the reference height with an r2 of around 0.6 at 150m resolution. The inverted tree height had an RMSE of less than 3.4 m and an r2 of around 0.7 at the same resolution.

During low tides, times of emersion, Mytilus californianus is exposed to aerial conditions and its body temperature can vary drastically depending on the amount of solar radiation they experience. Thermal stress from high temperatures during emersion sometimes can lead to mortality of individuals. Conversely, during high tides, times of submersion, body temperatures depend on the temperature of the water that surrounds them.\nThis study used remotely sensed surface temperature observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) Aqua and Terra to predict the body temperatures of Mytilus californianus. Mussel body temperatures were provided by the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO) and de-tided. This technique divided the mussel body temperatures into times of emersion and times of submersion. During times of emersion, mussel body temperatures were compared to remotely sensed land surface temperatures (LST) and in-situ air temperatures. During times of submersion, mussel body temperatures were compared to remotely sensed sea surface temperatures (SST) and in-situ water temperatures. To identify spatial variation in temperatures, eight different study sites ranging in latitude along the coast of Oregon were analyzed. Additionally, to better understand the temporal variation in temperatures, fourteen years (2000-2013) were analyzed for each study site.\nSea surface temperature collected during the Aqua overpass and Terra overpass were strongly correlated with mussel body temperatures but varied by study site. Our results show that remotely sensed temperature could predict average daily mussel temperature within 1°C on average during times of submersion.\nBeing able to use remotely sensed surface temperatures to predict the body temperatures of intertidal mussel species will enhance our ability to predict the effects of climate change on intertidal ecosystems. Additionally, it will lead to more research that investigates using remotely sensed observations to understand dynamics in other ecosystems beside the rocky intertidal.",

The amplitude of the seasonal cycle is larger in the northern tropics than in the southern tropics with a 2-3 month phase difference between the hemispheres. MLS data shows a distinct double peak in the magnitude of the northern-tropical seasonal cycle of ozone (in percent) with maxima at 100 hPa and 68 hPa and a relative at 82 hPa. SAGE and HALOE data show a single maximum located near 80 hPa. Analysis of two years of OMPS-limb data from the Suomi-NPP mission confirms the double peak structure measured by MLS. We will show comparisons of data from MLS and OMPS-limb and will examine the interannual variability of the double-peak structure from 10 years of MLS data. It appears that vertical advection is the dominant cause of tracer annual cycles in the southern tropics, while horizontal mixing dominates in the northern tropics. We argue that separating data into separate tropical regions for each hemisphere and examining the seasonal cycle and its interannual variability will lead to increased understanding of the processes that govern transport of ozone and other tracers in the tropical and sub-tropical lower stratosphere.",

            "abstract": "The hydrologic balance in most alpine watersheds is dominated by snowmelt, which provides peak spring runoff and recharges mountain aquifers, contributing to baseflow throughout the year. Measurement of snow-water equivalent (SWE) is necessary for accurate modeling of alpine hydrology but is challenging due to the variability in snow accumulation, ablation and redistribution at scales from microtopography to hillslopes to mountainsides. Here we present a method for imaging snow stratigraphy and estimating SWE over large distances from a ground-penetrating radar system mounted on a snowmobile. We mount commercial GPR systems (500 and 800 MHz) to the front of the snowmobile to provide maximum mobility and ensure that measurements are taken on pristine snow. High-quality images show detailed snow stratigraphy down to the ground surface over snow depths up to at least 8 m, enabling elucidation of snow accumulation and redistribution processes. We estimate snow density (and thus SWE, assuming no liquid water) by measuring radar velocity of the snowpack through migration focusing analysis. Results from the Medicine Bow Mountains, Wyoming, show that estimates of snow density from GPR (0.40±0.15 gm/cm3) are in good agreement with those from coincident snow cores (0.35±0.08 gm/cm3). Using this method, snow thickness, snow density, and therefore SWE can be measured over large areas solely from rapidly acquired common-offset GPR profiles, without the need for common-midpoint acquisition or snow cores.",

            "abstract": "Transient electromagnetic (TEM) data were acquired in Borrego Canyon within the Santo Domingo Basin of the Rio Grande Rift, central New Mexico, during the 2014 Summer of Applied Geophysical Experience (SAGE) field program. TEM surveys were carried out in several regions both to investigate geologic structure and to illustrate the effects of coupling to anthropogenic structures.\nTo determine an optimal survey configuration, 50, 100 and 200 m square transmitter loops were deployed; estimates of depth-of-investigation and logistical considerations determined that 50 m loops were sufficient for production-style measurements. A resistive (100s of ohm-m) layer was identified at a depth of 25-75 m at several locations, and interpreted as dismembered parts of one or more concealed volcanic flows, an interpretation consistent with Tertiary volcanic flows that cap the Santa Anna Mesa immediately to the south. TEM soundings were also made across an inferred fault to investigate whether fault offset is accompanied by lateral changes in electrical resistivity. Soundings within several hundred meters of the inferred fault strand were identical, indicating no resistivity contrast across the fault, and possibly an absence of recent activity.\nAn old windmill and water tank, long-abandoned, offered an excellent laboratory to study the effect of coupling to metallic anthropogenic structures. The character of the measured data strongly suggests the water tank is in electrical contact with the earth (galvanic coupling), and an induced response was persistent to more than 1 second after current turn-off. Coupling effects could be identified at least 150 meters from the tank. Understanding the mechanism behind such coupling and the ability to identify coupled data are critical skills, as one-dimensional modeling of data is affected by such coupling producing artificial conductive layers at depth.",

            "abstract": "This study examined the connections between the North Pacific climate variability and occurrence of the Central Pacific (CP) El Niño for the period from 1950-2012. A composite analysis indicated that the relationship between the North Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) along with its overlying atmospheric circulation and the CP El Niño during the developing and mature phases was changed when the occurrence frequency of the CP El Niño significantly increased after 1990. An Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) analyses of variability in the tropical Pacific and its relationship to North Pacific show that the North Pacific anomalous SST and the atmospheric variability are closely associated with the occurrence of the CP El Niño after 1990 than before 1990. There were noticeable differences in terms of the atmospheric variability conditions over the North Pacific such as the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO)-like atmospheric variability during the spring and its associated SST anomalies during the following winter before 1990 and after 1990. In addition, combined EOF analysis indicated that the wind-evaporation-SST feedback processes in the subtropical northeastern Pacific, which is associated with the NPO-like atmospheric circulation, become more effective to play a role in initiating the El Niño after 1990. Subsequently, such a change might have been associated with the frequent occurrence of the CP El Niño after 1990.",

            "abstract": "Large, deep-seated landslides always have the potential to reactivate in the future – generally locally and not the whole slide. How does one determine if one of these large landslides has reactivated if there are houses on it? In April of 2014 a 25 year old house was investigated to see if it was creeping on an ancient landslide near Kelso, Washington. In 1998 we had worked on nearby prehistoric slides to determine if they had reactivated. We developed a list of 17 points to investigate on a lot and in a house that showed that stress was causing movement. Inside the house we checked for: propagation of cracks in the walls, nails popping out of the walls, bulging walls, separation of internal and external chimney from walls, creaking and popping noises in the house, light switches coming out of the walls, doors and windows that are hard to shut, twisted ceiling and floor beams, cracks in concrete floors, and water seeping into the basement. On the lot outside we looked for changes in surface water drainage, bulges in retaining walls, scarps developing in the soils, pistol butt trees, and broken sewage and water lines. A stable site is defined as a site having none of the above characteristics. Slight movement is defined as having 1-5 of the above characteristics. Moderate movement is from 6 to 10 and considerable movement is from 11+. The house we investigated had a score of 14 – definitely was moving! It had had two electrical fires in the past year from severed electrical wires. We recommend that areas of slight movement be monitored, and lots with moderate to considerable movement to be dewatered to slow the movement. If engineering geologists know that movement has started early enough, proper mitigation can be installed that might stop the movement and save the homes.",

            "abstract": "Of interest here are single-tread alluvial channels (or mildly anastomosing reaches with a single dominant channel) which are self-formed within their own floodplain. The 232 reaches considered here cover nearly the entire range of such channels, with bankfull discharge varying from 3.3x10-1 m3/s to 2.6x105 m3/s, characteristic bed material size varying from 0.04 mm to 168 mm, bed slopes varying from 8x7x10-6 to 5.2x10-2 and bankfull depths varying from 2.2x10-1 m to 4.8x101 m. These channels show complexity at every scale, including the organization of bed grains, the existence or absence of bedforms such as dunes and bars, the state of eroding banks (e.g. fallen trees, rooted stumps, or slump blocks) and the species and density of floodplain vegetation. Scientific research can often be broadly classified into two types: a) research that shows that a system formerly thought to be relatively simple is instead much more complex, with an increase in the number of factors which must be considered to obtain understanding; and b) research which extracts general, broad-brush simplicity from complexity. Both approaches can contribute to the advancement of science. Here we consider the second approach. The problem in question pertains to an explanation of an observation from the time of Luna Leopold: the single bankfull parameter that appears to be invariant is bankfull flow velocity. Here we demonstrate this result empirically at first-order, obtaining the estimate of 1.5 m/s across scales. We then derive a single, universal dimensionless number that specifies bankfull velocity, again across scales. The result is independent of bed material grain size, suggesting that previously-ignored wash load plays a major, and perhaps the dominant role as floodplain material load in setting bankfull velocity.",

            "abstract": "The Australia-Pacific plate boundary south of New Zealand was an active ridge 45 Ma to 30 Ma, generating oceanic crust between the Resolution Rifted Margin and the Campbell Rifted Margin. Referred to as the Macquarie Ridge Complex (MRC), this boundary progressively evolved into a strike-slip boundary from 30 Ma to 20 Ma; the northern segment, the Fiordland-Puysegur subduction zone (FPSZ), has had a substantial transpressional component. Over the last 20 Myr, 600 km of highly oblique plate motion occurred at the MRC, and resulted in a maximum total convergence of 150-200 km at the FPSZ, which some simple models suggested might be near the threshold for a self-sustaining subduction. The morphology of the Puysegur Ridge shows a diagnostic change from uplift to subsidence expected for the transition of a subduction zone from being forced externally to being internally driven by the negative buoyancy of the slab. The large negative gravity anomalies over the Snares Zone, in the middle of the FPSZ, imply strong vertical forces pulling downward the lithosphere. To better understand these observations, we use a viscous flow forward model with a free surface to simulate the geodynamics of the FPSZ since 20 Ma. The forward model describes the dynamics of an incompressible, Stokes fluid. Brittle-ductile behavior of the material within the crust-asthenosphere is modeled by using a fluid viscosity defined via a composite flow law comprised from an Arrhenius and a Drucker-Prager rheology. The well-constrained relative plate motion between the Australian and Pacific plates is used to define a Dirichlet boundary condition for velocity within the lithosphere. In the mantle, we apply the hydrostatic pressure as a normal stress boundary condition. A simplified surface process model consisting of linear diffusion is applied at the free surface to simulate short-range erosion and sedimentation. Our models show that the topographic variations within the Puysegur Ridges may correspond to different stages of subduction initiation. The Snares Zone may be self-sustaining, while the northern and southern parts of the FPSZ are approaching such a self-sustaining threshold.",

            "abstract": "In this work, we use a physically based assessment to estimate the risk of hurricane storm surge at four sites along the U.S. North Atlantic coast. The sites are Narragansett Bay, RI, Jamaica Bay, NY, Atlantic City, NJ, and Norfolk, VA. These sites have all been identified as urban, coastal areas that are particularly vulnerable to storm surge. In consideration of the changing climate, we seek to assess the risk at these sites for both current and projected climate conditions. Using a novel approach to risk analysis, we estimate storm surge recurrence intervals by forcing a hydrodynamic model with thousands of hurricanes. Rather than relying on the limited historical records, we force the hydrodynamic model with the wind and pressure field data of synthetic hurricanes, which are generated from a statistical-deterministic model. This hurricane model uses large-scale atmospheric and oceanic data as input, which can be generated from global climate models (GCMs). To assess the risk of storm surge in the current climate, i.e. the 20th century, we use large-scale data of the observed climate as estimated by the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis. To assess the risk for projected climate scenarios, i.e. the 21st century, we use large-scale data modeled by four GCMs informed by the RCP8.5 emissions scenario from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change fifth assessment report. In addition to the generation of these ``21st century\" storms, we account for climate change by incorporating the rising mean sea level. We have also recently investigated strategies to best estimate recurrence intervals for the 21st century from the distinct recurrence intervals that result from each GCM. Our results have been used to inform a multi-institutional, interdisciplinary research effort to develop ``Structures of Coastal Resilience.\"",

            "abstract": "Early equilibration of the Earth’s mantle with the metallic core accounts for the depletion of siderophile elements in the mantle compared to a chondritic reference. The mantle is highly depleted in sulfur, implying partition into the core. Furthermore, the sulfur isotopic composition of the Earth’s mantle deviates significanlty from chondrites, with a 34S/32S shift of ~1.3‰[1]. On the other hand, the martian mantle is chondritic for S isotopes[2]. Here, we experimentally determine whether the sulfur incorporated in the core could have left such isotopic signatures on planetary mantles.\nExperiments were conducted at 1 and 1.5 GPa at 1650°C using Geophysical Laboratory’s piston-cylinders. Times series were performed to prove that equilibrium has been reached, with durations chosen between 10 and 180 minutes. Starting materials consisted of basalt, Fe and FeS. Isotope analysis on metallic and silicate fractions was subsequently performed using the University of Maryland MAT 253 gas source mass spectrometer.\nThe influence of the capsule on S behavior has been adressed by running 10 experiments in boron-nitride and 9 in graphite. The role of silicate melt structure to control S isotopic fractionation has also been tested by imposing variations of aluminium, boron and silicon oxide content in the silicate melt.\nReproducible δ34S values for metal and silicate fractions for times > 25 minutes indicate that at the high temperature conditions of our experiments, isotopic equilibrium was reached. There is a resolvable 34S/32S isotopic fractionation that consistently showed the silicate fraction to be depleted in 34S , consistent with the observed mantle value. We found the isotope fractionation between the two studied phases, 1000lnamet-sil, to be between 0.2±0.1‰ and 1.4±0.2‰ at 1650ºC, positively correlated to the abundance of aluminium and boron, but not silicon oxides.\nIsotope fractionations are hence related to charge compensation effects, and consistent with variation of coordination environment. Isotope fractionation will therefore increase with compaction, predicting non-trivial fractionation at high-pressure core-mantle equilibrium, hence offering an explanation for the S isotope composition of both the terrestrial and martian mantles.\n1 Labidi et al. 2013\n2 Franz et al. 2014",

Furthermore, a significant amount of work remains to be done in validating and improving the hurricane models.\nA major goal of NASA’s hurricane science research program is to bring a wealth of satellite and airborne observations to bear on addressing these outstanding issues. Despite the significant amount of satellite data, they are still underutilized in hurricane research and operations, due to their complexity and volume.\nTo meet this need, we are developing the JPL Tropical Cyclone Information System (TCIS) to facilitate the inter-comparison of models and observations by bringing them into a common system and developing online tools for joint analysis and visualization.\nThis NASA/ESTO/AIST funded project aims to develop an interactive near-real-time (NRT) portal with the goal to reduce barriers to timely delivery of satellite and model products to increase the understanding of the hurricane processes and the accuracy of their forecasts. The framework of timely data discovery, ingestion, visualization and analysis tools that we are developing presents a new prototype for integration of models and observations.\nIn this presentation we will start by describing the scientific questions. We will then outline our approach to providing fusion of models and observations. We will focus on the main components of our system: i) timely collection of NRT observations from a multitude of satellite instruments; ii) projecting the model forecast into the observational space by using instrument simulators (e.g. NASA Earth Observing System Simulator Suite, NEOS3) to compute synthetic observations (e.g. microwave brightness temperatures) from the model fields for a more direct comparison to the satellite and aircraft data; iii) development of on-line analysis tools; iv) visualization of highly complex systems that allows for user-driven interrogation of models and observations.\nAn important focus of the presentation will be the illustration of how our system can be used to evaluate several models (HWRF, GFS) by applying the analysis tools to several hurricanes observed during the 2013/2014 seasons. Finally, we will outline our future plans.",

            "abstract": "The pores and throats of shales and mudrocks are predominantly found within a range of 1-100 nm, within this size range the flow of gas at reservoir conditions will fall within the slip-flow and low transition-flow regime (0.001 < Kn < 0.5). Currently, the study of slip-flows is for the most part limited to simple tube and channel geometries, however, the geometry of mudrock pores is often sponge-like (organic matter) and/or platy (clays). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can be used to predict slip-flow in complex geometries, but due to prohibitive computational demand are generally limited to small volumes (one to several pores). Here we present a multi-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann model (LBM) parameterized for slip-flow (Guo et al. 2008) and adapted here to complex geometries. LBMs are inherently parallelizable, such that flow in complex geometries of significant (near REV-scale) volumes can be readily simulated at a fraction of the computational cost of MD simulations. At the macroscopic-scale the LBM is parameterized with local effective viscosities at each node to capture the variance of the mean-free-path of gas molecules in a bounded system. The corrected mean-free-path for each lattice node is determined using the mean distance of the node to the pore-wall and Stop’s correction for mean-free-paths in an infinite parallel-plate geometry. At the microscopic-scale, a combined bounce-back specular-reflection boundary condition is applied to the pore-wall nodes to capture Maxwellian-slip. The LBM simulation results are first validated in simple tube and channel geometries, where good agreement is found for Knudsen numbers below 0.1, and fair agreement is found for Knudsen numbers between 0.1 and 0.5. More complex geometries are then examined including triangular-ducts and ellipsoid-ducts, both with constant and tapering/expanding cross-sections, as well as a clay pore-network imaged from a hydrocarbon producing shale by sequential focused ion-beam scanning electron microscopy. These results are analyzed to determine grid-independent resolutions, and used to explore the relationship between effective permeability and Knudsen number in complex geometries.",

The watershed—Indonesia’s Ciliwung River basin—is characterized by a variety of conditions, from pristine tropical forests to the dense urban fabric of Jakarta. The region faces several challenges in terms of water resources, as its population and urban footprint grow exponentially. The Ciliwung River basin represents an exemplary case with positive trends in the occurrence of flooding events, and with three catastrophic floods hitting the city in 2002, 2007 and 2013.\nWe explore the effects of land-use changes on the hydrologic response of the Ciliwung River basin providing a distributed analysis of the hydrological regime for different scenarios of urbanization. The hydrological dynamics is simulated with the distributed model TOPKAPI-ETH, which allows for an explicit simulation of the major basin processes. Hourly model simulations are first tested for the period 2003-2008, when the most reliable meteorological and flow ground data are available. Subsequently, we compare the hydrologic regime across present and past land-use patterns, the latter as obtained by historical information. Finally, we use the model to test two future land-use scenarios (2030) which were prepared for a related study of regional planning. The worst-case scenario explores aggressive urban expansion, while the best-case scenario represents a strong constraint on urban expansion, combined with afforestation in the upper catchment.\nResults suggest that the projected urban expansion leads to an (intuitive) increase in the peak event runoff during the rainy season. Within this scenario downstream discharge increases by up to 20%. Slightly lower baseflow in the dry season is predicted in the order of a reduction of 5% on average in the months of June and July. A detailed overview of possible changes in the hydrological budget components is finally provided.",

            "abstract": "Tropical cyclones (TCs) actively contribute to Earth's climate by influencing oceanic mixing rates, surface fluxes, ocean heat budgets and transports, and large-scale circulations within the atmosphere and ocean. However, TC-climate effects are largely unexplored in fully-coupled Earth system models. Here we analyze results from century-scale pre-industrial control simulations using the high-resolution Community Climate System Model version 3.5 (CCSM3.5) (Kirtman et al., 2012). The modeling experiment consists of two simulations in which the 0.5 degree atmosphere component model is coupled to two different versions of the ocean model, with horizontal grid resolutions of 1 degree and 0.1 degree, respectively. In both configurations, realistic TCs are formed spontaneously within the model. We find that the atmosphere model simulates realistic TCs up to category 3 intensity for both configurations, and the modeled TCs’ mean intensity (i.e. power dissipation) is consistent with observation-based estimates for TCs up to category 3. Both model configurations produce realistic TC climatologies in the Northwest Pacific basin when compared against the observational record, and the model robustly reproduces the observed transient upper ocean surface responses following storm passage, from the perspective of individual storms as well as basin-scale budgets. We estimate TC-induced ocean heat convergence within both model configurations using multiple strategies accounting for mixing depths, and we find the heat convergence estimates are generally consistent across methods and insensitive to ocean model resolution. Using scaling arguments between heat convergence and power dissipation, we estimate that the model’s flux-adjusted TC-induced ocean heat convergence in the northwestern Pacific basin is ~0.20PW and ~0.23PW for the low and high resolution configurations, respectively, which is within the range of previous observation-based estimates. These results suggest that the basin-scale integrated TC effects within the coupled model are relatively insensitive to the choice of ocean grid resolution, when considering 1 degree versus 0.1 degree resolutions. Thus, relatively low resolution (non-eddy resolving) ocean models may sufficiently capture the large-scale ocean response to TC forcing.",

            "abstract": "To investigate the effect of land-use changes on sediment transportation in a small catchment, a short core from reservoir was obtained. Reservoir sedimentation rate changes during last 60 years were reconstructed by radionuclides, exPb-210 and Cs-137, and land-use changes from 1960’s to 2000’s were estimated by analyzing aerial photographs. Reservoir sedimentation rate changes can be recognized in three periods. During first period (1940’s ~ early in 1950’s), reservoir sedimentation rate had increased since the construction of reservoir. During second period (early in 1950’s ~ early in 1990’s), reservoir sedimentation rates were stable relatively around 3 kg m-2 a-1, however, two higher sedimentation peaks occurred. During last period (early in 1990’s ~ 2003), reservoir sedimentation rate had increased sharply. Before 1990’s, the sediment transportations from a catchment to reservoir had been changed little although the increase of forest and grassland areas and the readjustment of rice fields had been occurred repeatedly and those land-use changes might not affect considerably the sediment transportation. The increasing of field area and bare area due to the reduction of forest area since early in 1990’s might be a dominant factor for the increasing the supply of sediment from a catchment, and gradually increasing rainfall amount in this study area since 1970’s would also assist the rapid increasing of sedimentation rate. Therefore, these results implied that land use changes and increasing rainfall caused by climate changes could be result in huge sediment transportation in the future.",

The Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model version 3.6 is being implemented over a regional domain stretching across 4995 x 4455 km centred at Kathmandu, where an intensive field campaign, Sustainable Atmosphere for the Kathmandu Valley (SusKat) took place from December 2012 to February 2013. Seven stations around the valley collected data on meteorology and chemical parameters. WRF-Chem simulation are carried out for the winter time period at high horizontal resolution (1 km × 1 km), which is achieved by nesting the domain of interest, e.g. Kathmandu Valley, inside three coarser domains. Model validation is performed against the field data as well as satellite data, focusing on aerosols. The challenge of capturing the necessary atmospheric processes is discussed. The effort aims for a better understanding of atmospheric processes and aerosol impacts, as well as the impact of long-range transport, particularly of black carbon aerosol upon the radiative budget over the Himalayan glaciers. The rapid melting of Himalayan glaciers and snowfields, and the shrinkage of permafrost as noticed by glaciologists is a concern. Based on physically adjusted schemes, the WRF meteorological model performs well with Pearson correlation coefficients higher than 0.8 for temperature and solar radiation, although it has a tendency to overestimate wind speed. The WRF with chemistry is then used with local and regional emission databases, in combination and after comparison with the global inventory, as input for describing the long-range transport of aerosols. Improved aerosol prediction will allow us to provide crucial information needed for mitigation and adaptation strategies that save people’s lives across the Himalaya. The regional modelling tool is also being set up with an aim to capture aerosol interactions during fog formation, and to generate forecast during a field campaign of the increasing persistent winter fog that ICIMOD plans to coordinate across the Indo-Gangetic Plains during winters 2014-15 and 2015-16.",

Therefore, constructing a one-dimensional (1-D) reference velocity model will be a meaningful first step to understand the detailed velocity structure and also the tectonic evolution of the region. In this study, we use two-year long (2010-2011) ambient noise data recorded by three component broadband seismometers of KIGAM, KMA, F-net, and IRIS networks surrounding the study area. Ambient noise cross-correlations are calculated for station pairs sampling the study area. Multiple filter technique is applied to measure group and phase velocity dispersions of the fundamental mode Rayleigh and Love waves for period ranges between 5 and 70 s, which are sensitive to shear wave velocities in the crust and uppermost mantle. Recently developed inversion method using the Bayesian technique is applied to estimate 1-D models of shear wave velocities and corresponding uncertainties. Combined with the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique, the posterior probability density is evaluated for given data and the prior. Boundaries, velocities, and anisotropy parameters of layers are searched together on the assumption of the layered half-space model. The used method automatically adjusts the number of layers and degree of data fitting by the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) estimation and scaling of the data-covariance matrix, respectively. The estimated anisotropic S-wave velocity model in the crust and upper-mantle can help to investigate tectonic processes of the region. For practical use, our velocity model for the Northern Korean Peninsula can be useful to enhance monitoring power of the underground nuclear tests in given area.",

Much of the geomagnetic variability, known as secular variation, occurs on timescales of tens of years to many thousands of years, requiring the use of paleomagnetic observations to derive continuous records of the ancient field, referred to as paleosecular variation (PSV) records. Marine depositional systems where thick sedimentary sections accumulate at high sedimentation rates provide some of the best locations for obtaining long continuous PSV records that can reveal both the short- and long-term changes in the field. Scientific ocean drilling has been successful at recovering many such sections and the paleomagnetic records from these reveal how the amplitude of PSV differs between sites and through time. In this study, several such records cored during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP), Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP), and other cruises from high, mid, and low latitudes will be used to quantify time intervals of low and high PSV, to examine time-average properties of the field, to map spatial variations in the angular dispersion of the virtual geomagnetic pole (VGP), and to assess whether the spatial variation in angular dispersion changes with time.",

            "abstract": "The Late Triassic is marked by the formation of several large impact structures on the Earth, including the 90-km-diameter Manicouagan crater in Canada (Spray and Kelly, 1998). Anomalously high platinum group element (PGE) concentrations have been reported from the Upper Triassic deep-sea deposits in Japan, which have been interpreted to be derived from an extraterrestrial impact event forming the Manicouagan crater (Onoue et al., 2012; Sato et al., 2013). However, previous studies have not clarified the composition of the projectile. Here we report the PGE element ratios and osmium (Os) isotopic compositions of the Upper Triassic ejecta layers in Japan in order to understand the projectile component.\nEvidence for the Late Triassic impact event has been discovered in the deep-sea claystone layers at four bedded chert sections in the Japanese accretionary complex. The claystone layers contain microspherules, Ni-rich magnetite grains and high abundance of PGEs (Onoue et al., 2012). Biostratigraphic analysis of radiolarian fossils from the studied sections revealed that the claystone layers occur embedded in the upper middle Norian (Sugiyama, 1997; Onoue et al., 2012).\nIdentification of the projectile is attempted by comparing the isotope and elemental ratios of the ejecta deposit with similar data obtained from meteorites. The Ru/Ir and Pt/Ir ratios of all the claystone samples from the study sites are plotted along the mixing line between chondrites and upper continental crust. Although chondrites cannot be distinguished from iron meteorites by using PGE/Ir ratios, the claystone layers have Cr/Ir ratios between 104–105, indicating that the claystone layers are clearly contaminated by chondritic material. The Os isotope data show an abrupt and marked negative excursion from an initial Os isotope ratio of ~0.477 to unradiogenic values of ~0.126 in a claystone layer within a middle Norian bedded chert, indicating the input of chondrite-derived Os into seawater. The size of the projectile can be inferred from the sedimentary Os concentrations and isotope ratios, by making reasonable estimates of the range in the amount of Os released from the projectile into seawater. Assuming 22–100% release of chondrite-derived Os into seawater, the impactor is calculated to be 3.3–7.8 km in diameter.",

            "abstract": "Hydrogeological models that represent flow and transport in subsurface domains are usually large-scale with excessive computational complexity and uncertain characteristics. Uncertainty quantification for predicting flow and transport in heterogeneous formations often entails utilizing a numerical Monte Carlo framework, which repeatedly simulates the model according to a random field representing hydrogeological characteristics of the field. The physical resolution (e.g. grid resolution associated with the physical space) for the simulation is customarily chosen based on recommendations in the literature, independent of the number of Monte Carlo realizations. This practice may lead to either excessive computational burden or inaccurate solutions. We propose an optimization-based methodology that considers the trade-off between the following conflicting objectives: time associated with computational costs, statistical convergence of the model predictions and physical errors corresponding to numerical grid resolution.\nIn this research, we optimally allocate computational resources by developing a modeling framework for the overall error based on a joint statistical and numerical analysis and optimizing the error model subject to a given computational constraint. The derived expression for the overall error explicitly takes into account the joint dependence between the discretization error of the physical space and the statistical error associated with Monte Carlo realizations. The accuracy of the proposed framework is verified in this study by applying it to several computationally extensive examples. Having this framework at hand aims hydrogeologists to achieve the optimum physical and statistical resolutions to minimize the error with a given computational budget. Moreover, the influence of the available computational resources and the geometric properties of the contaminant source zone on the optimum resolutions are investigated. We conclude that the computational cost associated with optimal allocation can be substantially reduced compared with prevalent recommendations in the literature.",

            "abstract": "Air pollution has a great impact on both climate change and human health. One effective way to tackle with these issues is a use of atmospheric aerosol-chemistry models with high-resolution in a global scale. For this purpose, we have developed an aerosol-chemistry model based on a global cloud-resolving model (GCRM), Nonhydrostatic Icosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM; Tomita and Satoh, Fluid. Dyn. Res. 2004; Satoh et al., J. Comput. Phys. 2008, PEPS, 2014) under MEXT/RECCA/SALSA project. In the present study, we have simulated aerosols and tropospheric ozone over Japan by our aerosol-chemistry model “NICAM-Chem” with a stretched-grid system of approximately 10 km resolution, for saving the computer resources. The aerosol and chemistry modules are based on Spectral Radiation-Transport Model for Aerosol Species (SPRINTARS; Takemura et al., J. Geophys. Res., 2005) and Chemical AGCM for Study of Atmospheric Environment and Radiative Forcing (CHASER; Sudo et al., J. Geophys. Res., 2002). We found that our model can generally reproduce both aerosols and ozone, in terms of temporal variations (daily variations of aerosols and diurnal variations of ozone). Under MEXT/RECCA/SALSA project, we also have used these results obtained by NICAM-Chem for the assessment of their impact on human health.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic climate change possibly causes various impacts on human society and ecosystem. Here, we call possible damages or benefits caused by the future climate change as “climate risks”. Many climate risks are closely interconnected with each other by direct cause-effect relationship. In this study, the major climate risks are comprehensively summarized based on the survey of studies in the literature using IPCC AR5 etc, and their cause-effect relationship are visualized by a “network diagram”. This research is conducted by the collaboration between the experts of various fields, such as water, energy, agriculture, health, society, and eco-system under the project called ICA-RUS (Integrated Climate Assessment – Risks, Uncertainties and Society).\nFirst, the climate risks are classified into 9 categories (water, energy, food, health, disaster, industry, society, ecosystem, and tipping elements). Second, researchers of these fields in our project survey the research articles, and pick up items of climate risks, and possible cause-effect relationship between the risk items. A long list of the climate risks is summarized into ~130, and that of possible cause-effect relationship between the risk items is summarized into ~300, because the network diagram would be illegible if the number of the risk items and cause-effect relationship is too large. Here, we only consider the risks that could occur if climate mitigation policies are not conducted. Finally, the chain of climate risks is visualized by creating a “network diagram” based on a network graph theory (Fruchtman & Reingold algorithm).\nThrough the analysis of network diagram, we find that climate risks at various sectors are closely related. For example, the decrease in the precipitation under the global climate change possibly causes the decrease in river runoff and the decrease in soil moisture, which causes the changes in crop production. The changes in crop production can have an impact on society by changing the food price or food supply. Changes in river runoff can also make an impact on the hydropower efficiency. Comprehensive pictures of climate risks and their interconnections are clearly shown in a straightforward manner by the network diagram. We will have a discussion how our results can be helpful for our society to recognize the climate risk.",

Moment tensors are usually estimated by the least-square fitting of amplitudes in the observed seismograms. In this study, we apply a relative moment tensor procedure to study the clusters of the deep earthquakes. The relative moment tensor procedure inverts the moment tensors of clustered events at the same time using the amplitude ratio of the seismic phases recorded at same station generated between the events and the information of take off angle and azimuth of the seismic phases. The relative method has some advantage over the traditional moment tensor inversion methods: 1) no Green's function is needed and 2) using the relative amplitude between the events eliminates the inaccuracies of the Green’s functions because the seismic waves share similar ray paths between the cluster events. We use the relative method to study the source mechanisms of deep earthquake clusters in Tonga-Fiji subduction zone. We discuss the difference between our results and those of traditional studies, and its implications to the understanding of deep earthquake mechanisms.",

Using a combination of spectroscopic measurements, in situ observations, and ancillary data for the atmospheric thermodynamic state from radiosondes and cloud-clearing from active sounders, we can separate out the contribution of CH4 to clear-sky downwelling radiance spectra and its infrared surface forcing.

Unlike terrestrial heat waves, little work has been done to understand the dynamics of heat waves in sea surface temperature (SST). New high spatial and temporal resolution SST products now make it possible to investigate regions of persistent extreme anomalies in SST. Here we characterize the properties of Indian and Pacific Ocean heat waves and investigate how they are modulated by the dominant modes of Indo-Pacific climate variability. In particular, we investigate the influence of El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) in preconditioning ocean heat waves. For the purposes of this study we define heat waves based on an index of cumulative SST 1ºC above the annual maximum with a geographic extent on the order of 105 square kilometers. We examine the prevalence of ocean heat waves during different phases of ENSO and the IOD, and explore the oceanic and atmospheric processes that give rise to these events.",

Corals in temperate regions have lower skeletal growth rate because of relatively stressful environment, in particular lower SST than those in the tropics or subtropics. Dependency on SST proxies from those effects are required to be validated to better understand paleo-environment using temperate corals.\n This study reports Sr/Ca-based SST reconstructions for three temperate Porites coral colonies (USB93, USB12-01, USB12-03) collected from Kyushu, Japan, near the northern latitudinal limits of Porites. Results clearly indicated that Sr/Ca reliably reproduced SST variation, independent from growth rate variations, in contrast to δ18O-based reconstruction (Hirabayashi et al., 2013, Geochemical Journal). The inter-colony variation of skeletal Sr/Ca of two Porites corals (USB12-01, USB12-03) were observed. This is attributed to the difference in calcification processes between so called “smooth type” and “sharp type” proposed by Gagan et al. (2012) as is defined by the ratio of tissue thickness/extension rate. According to these observations, summer SST reconstruction can be achieved by a limited number of coral specimens in a temperate region with comparable accuracy to tropical and subtropical corals.",

The model allows a nonzero azimuthal component of magnetic field at the source surface, contrasting with the Parker model. The mapping shows that, typically, but not always, the magnetic fields are open and Parker-like. Nevertheless, the predicted field lines sometimes deviate significantly from the Parker direction, corresponding to when the observed magnetic fields are more azimuthally-oriented than the Parker model. Examples of non-Parker-like and Parker-like cases are shown, both for solar maximum and minimum conditions. Often the predicted magnetic field configurations are stable over consecutive solar rotations. The mapping predictions have important implications for particle propagation studies and for estimates of the length of the actual field lines.

Since the anthropogenic water management is able to change the surface energy budgets and the water cycle, some research has been done to assess its impacts on both regional and global climate. Note that much of the agricultural irrigation at boreal low latitudes is applied in wintertime. In this study, we use NCAR Community Earth System Model (CESM) to simulate the land-air interaction processes with water management and the consequent responses in atmospheric circulation and hydrological cycle. We conduct some perturbed experiments with different model complexities to clarify the corresponding effects of changes in surface energy balances and atmospheric circulation in both local and global manner. The preliminary results show that the wintertime agricultural irrigation at low latitudes is able to lower the surface Bowen ratio, and reduce the surface temperature in a continental scale through atmospheric feedbacks and to change the intensity of prevailing monsoon circulation. In addition, we observed anomalous tropical precipitation and mid-latitude climatic changes indicating tropical-extra tropical teleconnections. Based on these results, we propose that the location of heavily irrigated place is important to have impacts on remote regions which might be an important consideration on human sustainability. We also try to track the fingerprint of this potential climate forcing in observational data and to estimate its contribution relative to other anthropogenic and natural forcing in future climate projection.",

            "abstract": "Geochemical studies of Paleoproterozoic rocks have revealed that the initial rise of oxygen was protracted and that Earth’s surface environments fluctuated between oxic and anoxic states over hundreds of millions of years. Marine sediments of the 2.1 Gyr-old Franceville Basin of west central Africa are only lightly metamorphosed, and their geochemistry may thus reveal unique insights into the environmental and metabolic conditions during the history of rising oxygen levels. In the Franceville Basin stratigraphic variation totaling 10‰ in δ13Ccarb was previously documented. This contribution builds on this work and characterizes changes in C, N, and S cycles using stable isotope values. The results from systematic analysis of several biologically mediated redox proxies preserved in carbonates from the Franceville Basin will be presented, including δ34S values of pyrite and δ13C and δ15N values of bulk organic carbon and kerogens. Consistent with independent reports of an excursion in δ13Corg in the Franceville Basin and elsewhere, we find ~20‰ stratigraphic variation in δ13C of bulk organic carbon. Initial results for δ15N of bulk organic matter range from -6 to 6 ‰, a wider distribution of values than previously reported for the Franceville Basin and more negative than values reported for the similarly aged Onega Basin in Fennoscandia. I/Ca ratios range from near zero to near Phanerozoic levels and are consistent with the presence of iodate. Chromium reducible sulfide has been extracted from all but one sample, confirming the presence of pyrite. δ34S of pyrite as well as δ13C and δ15N of kerogen will also be presented. The biochemically diverse array of proxy analyses presented here have varying thresholds of sensitivity to oxygen levels and hence will allow detailed reconstruction of the redox history of basin waters.

            "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the influence of open loop ground source heat pump systems operation on hydrological conditions of aquifer. Test bed is located in Chuncheon, Korea. The step drawdown test was conducted in five stages for 300 minutes. The variation of groundwater levels by open loop ground source heat pump systems operation was estimated using Visual MODFLOW. Transmissivity ranged from 2.02×10-4 to 9.36×10-4, and storage coefficient ranged from 0.00067 to 0.021. The amount of optimum bleeding was calculated to be 240 m3/day. When bleeding will be 50, 90, 240 and 450 m3/day for 5 years, groundwater levels may decrease 1.84, 3.31, 8.89 and 17.0 m, respectively. If the amount of bleeding is 50 m3/day, the influence of bleeding will not reach the boundary regions of the Soyang River after 5 years. Regarding the open loop ground source heat pump system installed at the test bed, the amount of optimum bleeding in accordance with the stand are proposed by the government is 90 m3/day, which is 20% of the 450 m3/day circulation quantity of the system. However, if continuous bleeding of more than 90 m3/day occurs, then the radius of influence is expected to reach the boundary regions of the Soyang River after 5 years. These results indicate that amount of optimum bleeding differ in each open loop ground soured heat pump system. Therefore, the debate for the amount of optimum bleeding in open loop ground source heat pump systems is demanded.

The project has now produced up to twenty-two years of consistent, calibrated and validated ESDR products for over 3200 GPS stations from Western North America, other plate boundaries, and global networks made available through the GPS Explorer data portal and NASA’s CDDIS archive. The combined solution of daily coordinate time series uses SOPAC h-files and JPL STACOV files as input to the st_filter software. The combined time series are then fit with the analyze_tseri software for daily positions/displacements, secular velocities, coseismic and postseismic displacements, as well as annual and semi-annual signatures and non-coseismic offsets due primarily to equipment (antenna) changes. Published uncertainties for the estimated parameters take into account temporal noise in the daily coordinate time series. The resulting residual coordinate time series with typical daily RMS values of 1.5-4.0 mm in the horizontal and 4.0-8.0 mm in the vertical can then can be mined for other signals such as transient deformation associated with earthquake tremor and slip (ETS) and hydrological effects. As part of this process we have catalogued and characterized coseismic displacements due to more than 80 earthquakes affecting over hundreds of regional and global stations, as well as significant postseismic deformation for the larger events. The larger events can affect stations 1000’s of km from the earthquake epicenters and thus significantly affect the positions of stations used in defining the reference frame. We discuss the implications and contributions of our ongoing analysis to the long-term maintenance of the international terrestrial reference frame.",

            "abstract": "Ten years after the successful landing of the HUYGENS probe on the surface of Titan, we reassess the complex permittivity measurements of the surface materials performed by the PWA-HASI experiment (Permittivity, Waves and Altimetry - Huygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument).\nThe complex permittivity is inferred from the mutual impedance of a classical quadrupolar probe, ie. the ratio of the voltage measured by a receiving dipole over the current emitted by another dipole. Using a simple model of the quadrupole configuration, the dielectric constant of the material at the landing site was first estimated to be of the order of 1.8. A more realistic numerical model that took into account the influence of the HUYGENS gondola yielded a dielectric constant in the range 2-3 and a conductivity in the range 0.4 - 0.8 nS/m. due to uncertainties about the system geometry ( Grard et al., 2006). However, a puzzling experimental fact remains to be explained, namely a sudden variation of the amplitude and phase of the received voltage 11 mn after landing that cannot be associated with any lander mechanical disturbance. Permittivity estimations were based on the first 11 mn sequence.\nThe present analysis takes advantage of a recent analysis of the landing process that provided more realistic final position and attitude for the HUYGENS lander (Schroder et al., 2012). The new results lie within former estimated ranges and attention is paid to their sensitivity to geometry and to the reference measurements collected immediately before landing. This point is particularly critical for the estimation of the conductivity.\nThe complete data set has been analysed, including the sequence collected after the first 11 mn. We consider various scenarios that may explain the observed phase and amplitude discontinuity. We tested two layers ground models in order to investigate the possibility that the upper layer may have experienced a fast physical change due to deliquescence or outgasing. Unfortunately a rigid quadrupolar array measure the average electric properties of the ground and cannot detect any inhomogeneity.\nWe present in addition the measurements made last May in the Dachstein ice cave in Austria, with a mockup of HUYGENS-PWA and a replica of the PP-SESAME instrument onboard the PHILAE lander of ROSETTA",

            "abstract": "Much of the recent work on advection-dispersion of sediment in rivers has been motivated by, and based on the Master Equation of the Continuous Time Random Walk model. The model, which considers a particle moving through a lattice, has provided the basis for the study of asymptotic forms that include one kind of nonlocality associated with heavy-tailed PDF for particle step length and waiting time. In the case of pebbles moving as bed material load (and thus interacting with the bed), however, the lattice itself varies according to the entrainment and deposition of pebbles, so that CTRW does not formally apply. Here we outline the development of an Exner-based Master Equation for the dispersal of bedload particles. The Master Equation has no active layer, and describes both streamwise and vertical advection-dispersion. Of particular importance is the treatment of waiting time. The formulation is based on the evolution of age structure in population dynamics. As a particle is deposited and buried at some elevation, its age is set to zero; it continues to age in place until the bed erodes down to that level and re-entrains the particle.",

            "abstract": "Climate change adaptation has attracted growing attention with the recent extreme weather conditions that affect people around the world. More and more countries, including the Republic of Korea, have begun to hatch adaptation plan to resolve these matters of great concern. They all, meanwhile, have mentioned that it should come first to integrate climate information in all analysed areas. That’s because climate information is not independently made through one source; that is to say, the climate information is connected one another in a complicated way. That is the reason why we have to promote integrated climate change adaptation platform before setting up climate change adaptation plan. Therefore, the large-scaled project has been actively launched and worked on. To date, we researched 620 literatures and interviewed 51 government organizations. Based on the results of the researches and interviews, we obtained 2,725 impacts about vulnerability assessment information such as Monitoring and Forecasting, Health, Disaster, Agriculture, Forest, Water Management, Ecosystem, Ocean/Fisheries, Industry/Energy. Among 2,725 impacts, 995 impacts are made into a database until now. This database is made up 3 sub categories like Climate-Exposure, Sensitivity, Adaptive capacity, presented by IPCC. Based on the constructed database, vulnerability assessments were carried out in order to evaluate climate change capacity of local governments all over the country. These assessments were conducted by using web-based vulnerability assessment tool which was newly developed through this project. These results have shown that, metropolitan areas like Seoul, Pusan, Inchon, and so on have high risks more than twice than rural areas.\nAcknowledgements: The authors appreciate the support that this study has received from “Development of integrated model for climate change impact and vulnerability assessment and strengthening the framework for model implementation ”, an initiative of the Korea Environmental & Industry Technology Institute .",

            "abstract": "Traditional descriptions of state evolution in the rate-state friction framework do not explain the whole range of laboratory friction experiments. Nagata et al. (2012) have recently suggested that adding a stressing rate dependence to Dieterich (Aging) law state evolution, derived using ultrasonic P-wave transmissivity across frictional interfaces in granite as a proxy for the state variable, could remedy these deficiencies. For 1-3 orders of magnitude velocity step datasets on both rock and gouge, each dataset better fit by the Ruina (Slip) than the Aging law, the stressing-rate dependent Nagata state evolution produces fits identical to the Slip law as long as the stressing-rate parameter c is larger than a lower bound. This lower bound on c increases with the size of the excursion from steady state, ranging from ∼ 10 − 70 over 2- to 3-orders steps as opposed to the c = 2.0 reported by Nagata et al. (2012) for their smaller departures from steady state. On the other hand, the Nagata law with c ∼ 2.0 fits the stress minima at the end of a sequence of holds better than both the Aging and Slip laws but fails to match the evolution of peak stresses upon reslide after long holds. These disagreements with laboratory data and the variations in c under different mechanical conditions lead us to question both the mathematical form of the Nagata stressing-rate dependence and their assumed linear mapping between acoustic transmissivity and state. We investigate these issues using a set of large velocity steps and long slide-hold-slides (SHS) on bare rock complemented by ultrasonic monitoring of the frictional interface. Unlike the experiments of Nagata et al. (2012), we study the micro-mechanical details of frictional sliding far from steady state by using S-wave transmitted phases. Preliminary analyses show that the values of c for the best Nagata law fits to the stress data, which also lead to the best agreement between the Nagata law state variable and shear wave transmissivity, differ by almost an order of magnitude between large velocity steps and SHS tests during the same experimental run. The Nagata law, however, fails to match both the stress peaks and the evolution of transmissivity across reslides after long holds suggesting that the stressing rate dependence of state, as formulated by Nagata et al. (2012), might need revision.",

We built a continuous GPS network starting in 2005, with the ultimate goal of understanding the kinematics and dynamics of this portion of the subduction zone. Using observations from this network, as well as others in the region, combined with InSAR, seismic and tsunami observations, we obtain estimates of inter-seismic, co-seismic and initial post-seismic fault slip using an internally consistent Bayesian unregularized approach. We evaluate the extent of spatial overlap between regions of fault slip during this different time periods. Of particular interest to this event is the extent and nature of any geodetic evidence for transient slow fault slip preceding the Pisagua Earthquake mainshock. To this end, we compare daily and high rate GPS solutions, the former of which shows long period transient motion started about 15 days before the mainshock and with maximum registered amplitude of 14.2 +/- 2 [mm] at site PSGA. Contrary to published findings, we find that pre-seismic deformation seen by the GPS network can be explained as coseismic motion associated with the multiple foreshocks.",

            "abstract": "Dia-free and Dia-bearing Grt-Cpx rocks occur in the Kumdy-Kol area of the Kokchetav Massif. In order to determine fluid conditions during the Kokchetav metamorphism, water in Grt and Cpx, and their distribution were examined by micro FT-IR method. Structural OH and molecular H2O in Grt and Cpx both in Dia-free (sample no. XX16) and Dia-bearing Grt-Cpx rocks (nos. 24997 & 25018) were detected. “Wet” Grt and “dry” Grt were recognized in the same sample, respectively.\nThe mineral assemblage of Grt-Cpx rocks are as in the followings. Dia-free: Grt+Cpx+Cal+Qtz+Kfs+Ttn. Ttn contains exsolved coesite needles in the core. Dia-bearing: Grt+Cpx+Rt+Dia. Large-grained “microdiamond” (ca. 150 μm at average) occurs as an inclusion in Grt and Cpx and as an interstitial phase in their grain boundaries. Rt occurs as intergranular phase in the matrix. Some of Rt grains show lamella texture.\nIR absorption bands of Grt and Cpx were determined by the Gaussian/Lorentzian fitting of IR spectra. Molecular H2O band (3400-3430 cm-1) and structural OH band (3555-3570 cm-1) were detected in Grt. Whereas OH band belongs to OH incorporated in Grt structure, H2O band is assigned to molecular H2O in submicron fluid inclusions. OH and H2O contents were estimated based on the assumption that IR coefficient of H2O is the same as that of OH in Grt (8770 L/mol/cm2; Katayama et al., 2005). The results are as follows:\nDia-free no. XX16 (OH, H2O): (568, 185) - (981, 870) ppm (wt. H2O),\nDia-bearing no. 25018 (OH, H2O): (391, 294) - (1165, 1218) ppm,\nDia-bearing no. 24997 (OH, H2O): (0, 0) - (528, 778) ppm.\nStructural OH contents in Grt in both Grt-Cpx rocks increase with increasing molecular H2O. OH contents in Grt in Dia-free rock are higher than those in Dia-bearing rocks. Mapping of water distribution in the rock (no. 24997) showed that a Grt grain near a Dia grain (cuboid) contains total water of 1358 ppm, but the other grains apart from the Dia contain very low total water (<40 ppm). Water in Cpx also shows the similar trends. The heterogeneity of water distribution in the Dia-free Grt-Cpx rock was previously reported by Sakamaki & Ogasawara (2014). Our micro FT-IR study clarified the heterogeneous distribution of H2O-rich fluid both in the Dia-bearing and Dia-free Grt-Cpx rocks, which might have controlled the Dia formation during the Kokchetav UHP metamorphism.",

            "abstract": "Climate models are valuable tools for understanding how Earth's climate system is changing, yet they are inherently uncertain. Two key sources of uncertainty include: (1) internal variability affecting simulations from a single model initialized from different states, and (2) structural uncertainties affecting multi-model intercomparisons. These uncertainties can significantly increase the spread of climate model projections and interpretations of potential future change. Here we compare results from a new 50-member climate change ensemble experiment, utilizing the low-resolution configuration of the fully-coupled Community Earth System Model (CESM), with results from the CMIP5 models to diagnose the skill of climate model ensembles that predominantly sample structural uncertainties versus internal variability. The CESM ensemble is comprised of transient hindcasts and projections (1850-2100) using historical forcings and the RCP8.5 projection scenario. The transient simulations are initialized from different initial model states, sampled from a ~10,000 year fully-coupled unforced equilibrium simulation that captures internal unforced variability of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system. We find that both the CESM and CMIP5 ensemble strategies have a significant effect on projections of key climate change metrics, and the projected ranges increase with decreasing spatial scale. Further, the CESM ensemble demonstrates considerable skill in simulating key regional climate processes relevant to decision-makers, such as seasonal temperature variability and extremes. When combined with statistical estimation methods, the CESM ensemble provides a useful framework for analyzing projection uncertainties surrounding regional extremes on decadal timescales. Given the tradeoffs between model resolution and computational cost, our results indicate that the ensemble/statistical methods presented here are a useful resource for quantifying decision-relevant uncertainties and analyzing climate change impacts.",

            "abstract": "The atmospheric levels of CO2 and CH4 are mainly governed by emissions from several anthropogenic as well as biogenic sources. Anthropogenic sources have different emission characteristics, and emit CO2, CH4 with various other trace gases like CO, NOx, SO2... etc in different ratios. CO is a useful tracer for differentiating between natural and anthropogenic emissions, as the natural source does not affect its levels significantly. Therefore the interrelations of CO2, CH4 with CO and other co-emitted species can be useful for identifying the relative role of emission sectors on the total emission of CO2 and CH4. Simultaneous measurements of CO2, CO and CH4 were made over Ahmedabad (23.03oN, 72.58oE, 55m AMSL), a semi-arid urban site of western India, during the period of autumn (November 2013), winter (December 2013–February 2014) and Monsoon (July 2014) using an online analyser based on the cavity ring-down spectroscopy technique. The measurements show that atmospheric CO correlates well with CO2 during the autumn and winter. The slope of CO and CO2 (∆CO/∆CO2) is found to be in the range of 0.02 and 0.03 which agrees well with the emission ratio for India as per Asian inventory proposed by Street et al., (2003) and connote the influence of mixed sources (fossil fuel as well as biomass burning) during this period. In July , CO doesn’t correlate well with CO2 (r2 =0.14), but the slope is around 0.005, indicates the dominance of fossil fuel during this time. The correlation and slope (slope ~ 0.02 and r2 ~ 0.55) of CH4 with CO2 remain fairly constant which demonstrate that the study area does not have significant changes in the source of these gases throughout the study period. Details of the levels, amplitude of diurnal variations of CO2, CO, CH4 as well as their mutual interrelationship will be presented.",

            "abstract": "A new ship-based Fourier transform spectrometer has been developed to measure the atmospheric downwelling and reflected infrared radiance spectrum at the Earth's surface with high absolute accuracy. This instrument was designed and built by ABB (Québec, Canada) based on the heritage of the Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI) designed by the University of Wisconsin Space Science and Engineering Center (UW-SSEC) for the Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program. Prior versions of the M-AERI have been operated by the University of Miami for over a decade on research ships transiting the Atlantic and Pacific in support of NASA and NOAA satellite validation.\nThe M-AERI measures infrared radiance between 520-3020 cm-1 (3.3-19 μm), at a resolution of 1 cm-1, using two detectors cooled to cryogenic temperatures with a Stirling cycle cooler. A gold-coated rotating scene mirror allows the M-AERI to selectively view the atmospheric scene at zenith, and ocean/atmospheric scenes over a range of +/- 45° from the horizon. The AERI uses two high-emissivity blackbodies for radiometric calibration, which in conjunction with the instrument design and a suite of rigorous laboratory diagnostics, ensures the radiometric accuracy to be better than 1% (3σ) of the ambient radiance.\nThe M-AERI radiance spectra can be used to retrieve profiles of temperature and water vapor in the troposphere, as well as measurements of trace gases, cloud properties, and ocean skin temperature. The M-AERI measurement of ocean skin temperature has a demonstrated accuracy of better than 0.1 K.\nThe first marine deployment of the new M-AERI will be as part of the second ARM mobile facility (AMF-2) during the ARM Cloud Aerosol Precipitation Experiment (ACAPEX) on board the NOAA Ship Ronald H. Brown in early 2015, occurring jointly with the NOAA CalWater 2 experiment. This field campaign aims to improve understanding and modeling of large-scale dynamics and cloud and precipitation processes associated with atmospheric rivers and aerosol-cloud interactions that influence precipitation variability and extremes in the western United States.",

Additionally, students find it difficult to learn from instructors that are not engaging or are unable to simplify concepts, methods, and analyses. These complications multiple when graduate students try to teach non-science undergraduates. Graduate instructional/teaching assistants have less teaching experience, often do not care about teaching, and frequently get frustrated with non-science undergraduates more easily. This presentation will focus on teaching non-science undergraduates in marine science and geology classes by engaging students, simplifying concepts, working in groups, and making the material fun and interesting.\nInstructional/teaching assistants teach undergraduate courses as a way to pay for their graduate education and in doing so, often forget to express their passion and interest in the subject. Graduate instructional/teaching assistants will be asked not give up on undergraduates because of their lack of interest and experience but rather challenge them to remember what it is like to feel lost and disinterested. While we may not be able to turn them into scientists, we can share our passion, teach them scientific concepts, and hope they leave feeling more knowledgeable, comfortable, and with more appreciation for the geosciences.",

            "abstract": "NASA-GSFC is developing a twin-channel, Integrated-Path, Differential Absorption (IPDA) lidar to measure atmospheric CO2 from space as a candidate for NASA’s ASCENDS mission (Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons).\nThis lidar consists of two independent, tuned, pulsed transmitters on the same optical bench using a common 8” receiver telescope. The system measures CO2 abundance and O2 surface pressure in the same column to derive the dry volume mixing ratio (vmr). The system is being tested on an airborne platform up to altitudes of 13 Km.\nThe lidar uses a cw scanning laser, externally pulsed and a fiber amplifier in a Master Oscillator Power Amplifier (MOPA) configuration to measure lineshape, range to scattering surfaces and backscatter profiles. The CO2 operates at 1572.335 nm. The O2 channel uses similar technology but frequency doubles to the O2 A-band absorption, around 765nm. Both lasers are scanned across the absorption feature measuring at a fixed number of discrete (~30) wavelengths per scan around ~300 scans/s. Each output pulse is slightly chirped <12MHz as the laser is tuning. Removing this chirp will improve our ability to infer vertical CO2 distribution from a more accurately measured line shape.\nA Step Tuned Frequency Locked (STFL) DBR diode laser system has been integrated into the CO2 lidar. Tuning and locking takes a ~30µs and the laser is locked to < ±100KHz. We have the ability to position these pulses anywhere on the absorption line other than within a few MHz of line center.\nWhile the telescope and fiber coupling scheme remains unchanged the detectors have been upgraded. The O2 system now uses eight SPCMs in parallel to improve count rates and increase dynamic range. Especially useful when flying over bright surfaces. This will improve our ability to measure the O2 pressure at cloud tops and aid in the determining the vmr above clouds.\nAn HgCdTe e-APD detector with a quantum efficient of >80%, linear over five decades is now used for CO2 channel. We have increased spatial resolution by an order of magnitude using 0.1s along track integration. The increased signal, negligible nonlinear response and increased spatial resolution will improve our CO2 retrievals.\nWe will discuss the improvements and effects on the retrievals from the Summer 2014 ASCENDS Science campaign.",

            "abstract": "We use a linear array of temporary seismometers to derive a shear-wave velocity model of the upper ~1000m of the crater area of White Island, an active volcano in New Zealand. We use noise interferometry to generate dispersion curves and invert these dispersion curves to obtain a layered 1D model. By exploiting the varying interstation distances along the array, we are able to define a strong shallow impedance contrast in the upper 10 meters as well as a depth to 'effective' bedrock at about 100m. We limit the bandwidth of the measured dispersion using a 2-wave cycle approximation and construct a composite dispersion curve. We then invert the dispersion curves with two separate inversion algorithms in an effort to test the validity of using this broadband approach for monitoring active volcanoes. The first method is a non-linear approach and is useful when an a-priori starting model is poorly known or if a velocity inversion is likely. Unfortunately, this type of non-linear inversion is more sensitive to small perturbations in the recovered Green's Functions, which may be due to non-equipartitioning of the wavefield as well as to velocity changes. The second is a linearized and damped LSQR approach which we envision will be more useful for routine monitoring in situations in which the starting model is well defined. In this case, selective regularization can be used to stablize moving time-window inversion. Lastly, our results will be used as input for hydrothermal fluid flow modelling conducted in a concurrent study.",

            "abstract": "Luminescence techniques are an emerging tool to track transport and provenance of grains in Quaternary fluvial and aeolian deposits. The incomplete zeroing of luminescence signals (partial bleaching) in fluvial environments is an obstacle for dating, but proves advantageous for extracting information about grain-transport histories. Luminescence signals from quartz and feldspar sand have been observed to decrease as an exponential or stretched exponential function of distance downriver. A theoretical framework for the reduction in signal of quartz grains in ephemeral rivers has recently been proposed. We present improvements to a simple forward model for reduction in signal observed for small-aliquot multiple elevated temperature post-IR infrared stimulated luminescence (MET-pIRIR) of K-feldspar grains on the Mojave River in Southern California. Specifically, we use USGS historical stream gage records to produce synthetic hydrographs using time-series analysis. The synthetic hydrographs are used as inputs for an iterative model of signal growth (burial period between floods) and signal depletion (light exposure period during floods). From a best fit of this model to small-aliquot MET-pIRIR data, we can estimate virtual velocity of fine-grain (175 – 200 µm) sand from source to sink. Additionally, we present single-grain MET-pIRIR measurements of K-feldspar grains from the Mojave River and the Santa Clara River in Southern California and explore applications of single-grain data to provenance studies.",

            "abstract": "Supercontinent break-up has most commonly been linked to plume or superplume events, and/or supercontinent thermal insulation, but precise mechanisms are yet to be worked out. Even less know is if and what roles other factors may play. Key factors likely include gravitational force due to the continental superswell driven by both the lower-mantle superplume and continental thermal insulation, mental convention driven by the superplume and individual plumes atop the superplume, assisted by thermal/magmatic weakening of the supercontinent interior (both plume heat and thermal insulation heat). In addition, circum-supercontinent slab downwelling may not only drive the formation of the antipodal superplumes (thus the break-up of the supercontinent), the likely roll-back of the subduction system would also create extension within the supercontinent, facilitating supercontinent break-up.\nConsequences of supercontinent break-up include long-term sea-level rise, climatic changes due to changes in ocean circulation pattern and carbon cycle, and biodiversification. It has long been demonstrated that the existence of the supercontinent Pangea corresponds to a long-term sea-level drop, whereas the break-up of the supercontinent corresponds to a long-term sea-level rise (170 m higher than it is today). A recent analysis of Neoproterozoic sedimentary facies illustrates that the time of Neoproterozoic supercontinent Rodinia corresponds to a low in the percentage of deep marine facies occurrence, whereas the time of Rodinia break-up corresponds to a significantly higher percentage of deep marine facies occurrence. The long-tern sea-level drop during supercontinent times were likely caused by both plume/superplume dynamic topography and an older mean age of the oceanic crust, whereas long-tern sea-level rise during supercontinent break-up (720–580 Ma for Rodinia and Late Jurassic–Cretaceous for Pangea) likely corresponds to an younger mean age of the oceanic crust, massive plume-induced magmatism in the oceans, and perhaps the effect of continents drifting away from a weakening sub-supercontinent superplume.",

            "abstract": "Previous modeling studies have predicted that high flows in the Oregon Cascades will become larger and shift towards earlier in the winter season with climate warming. The impact of those changes on bedload transport frequency and channel morphology remains unknown, however. We examined changes in the timing and magnitude of bedload transport under modeled flow scenarios to identify which rivers draining the Cascades with different hydrologic regimes are most vulnerable to increased frequency of bedload transport. Such increases in the frequency or magnitude of gravel entrainment might lead to disturbance of fragile salmon or bull trout habitat. We calculated bedload transport rates using field measurements of surface sediment size, channel geometry, and channel slope along 14 reaches that included streams with a range of drainage areas and flow regimes (i.e., spring-fed and surface-runoff dominated). Our findings suggest that both spring-fed and surface-runoff streams are vulnerable to predicted changes in the flow regime, but in different ways. Spring-fed streams, characterized by relatively uniform discharge, will likely experience changes in both the timing and magnitude of transport. Spring-fed streams are poised just above the critical transport threshold for a large portion of the year, therefore small changes in the highest flows may lead to marked changes in transport rates. Transport events in surface-runoff streams, which are already characterized by flashy flows, will likely become larger and more frequent. Changes in the frequency and timing of bedload transport in both spring-fed and surface runoff streams will impact bed stability and texture and should be considered for managing these watersheds in the future.",

            "abstract": "The X-discontinuity (~300 km) in the upper mantle has been revealed under some continental or oceanic region by a number of seismic studies, at which depth the P and S wave velocities increase by about 2%. One possible cause for this discontinuity is the coesite-stishovite phase transition. In this study, we conducted ultrasonic interferometry measurements on polycrystalline coesite and stishovite up to 12.6 GPa at ambient temperature and 14GPa 1073K, respectively. While the P wave velocities of coesite continuously increase with pressure, the S wave velocities exhibit a monotonic decrease to the peak pressure of the current experiment followed by a reversible recovery upon release of pressure. As a result, within the pressure range of 8-12 GPa (corresponding to ~250-350 km depths), the velocity contrasts between coesite and stishovite reach as high as ~38% for P wave and 48%-50% for S wave together with impedance contrasts of 71-69% and ~78% for P and S waves, respectively, the highest among all known phase transitions in mantle minerals. With such extreme contrasts, the coesite-stishovite phase transition in the MORB composition with 4-10wt% of SiO2 is sufficient to generate velocity and impedance contrasts comparable to those reported for the X-discontinuity. The current data, together with the seismic X-discontinuity, may provide a geophysical approach to track the ancient subducted oceanic slabs, and place constraints on the amount of silica in the upper mantle.",

Two-moment convective cloud microphysics scheme developed by Song and Zhang (2011) and Song et al. (2012) is tested in NSF/DOE CAM5.\nCompared to the default model, CAM5 with the convective cloud microphysics scheme produces less precipitation in most tropical oceans but more precipitation over tropical lands. More OLR is seen over the ITCZ regions except over the Maritime Continent (MC). The intraseasonal variability in precipitation is better simulated over the MC (and other continents) in the selected hindcast period (Oct 10-Nov 25, 2009). Stratiform precipitation is enhanced over the MC, consistent with changes in the heating, cloud, and relative humidity profiles.

            "abstract": "An auroral substorm commences when a discrete auroral arc brightens and subsequently expands poleward and azimuthally. The arc that brightens is usually the most equatorward of several auroral arcs that remain quiescent for ~5 to ~60 minutes before the break-up commences. This arc is often referred to as the “pre-existing auroral arc (PAA)” or the “growth-phase arc”. Till now, the ionospheric electrodynamics of the PAA has been studied extensively by ground radar, rockets and low-altitude spacecraft, and it is well established that the field-aligned currents (FAC) associated with the PAA in the ionosphere are current sheets that are narrow in latitude and elongated in longitude. However, it remains a question whether the ionospheric currents that connect the FAC pair of the PAA are meridional or azimuthal. \nIn this study, we have identified ~180 PAA events from FAST measurements in 1998 and 1999 and used the statistics to investigate the ionospheric current closure of the PAA. We calculate the height-integrated Pedersen currents from the electric fields measured by FAST using an empirical ionospheric conductance model and infer the FAC density from the divergence of the Pedersen currents. We find that in the vicinity of the PAA, the FAC density inferred from the divergence of perpendicular currents mimics the trend of the FAC density inferred from magnetic perturbations seen on FAST, and that the boundaries between the upward and the downward FAC sheets inferred from two different approaches lie very close together. Additionally, the latitudinal gradient of the azimuthal component of the magnetic perturbation is much larger than the azimuthal gradient of the meridional component of the magnetic perturbation in the vicinity of the PAA, indicating that the density of a meridional current is much larger than that of an azimuthal current. Our observational analysis strongly suggests that the perpendicular current that closes the FAC pair of the PAA is a north-south Pedersen current in the ionosphere.",

            "abstract": "Winter temperature tides observed by lidar at McMurdo (77.8°S, 166.7°E), Antarctica, show less than 3 K diurnal and semidiurnal tidal amplitude below 100 km. However, above 100 km, the diurnal and semidiurnal tidal amplitudes grow super-exponentially and can reach at least 15 K near 110 km, which are exceeding that of the freely propagating tides originating from the lower atmosphere. Such fast growth exists for all Kp index cases and diurnal amplitude increases to 15−30 K at 110 km with larger Kp indices corresponding to larger tidal amplitudes and faster growth rates. Combining with the slopes of diurnal tidal phases being steeper above 100 km, and the tidal phases barely changing with altitude from 100 to 106 km, it indicates that in-situ tidal sources may exist near or above 100 km.\nIn this paper, we utilize the coupled thermosphere ionosphere plasmasphere electrodynamics (CTIPe) model to investigate possible sources/mechanisms that lead to the fast amplitude growth of tides in the polar winter region. Joule heating, particle precipitation, and dynamical heating are likely to be the dominant thermospheric tidal sources, according to CTIPe model. Interestingly, the CTIPe tidal amplitudes induced by these sources form a concentric pattern with its center located at the geomagnetic pole, implying that the geomagnetic activity may play an important role. Furthermore, dynamical heating, which includes adiabatic heating/cooling and vertical advection, is likely to be the explanation of the fast growth of diurnal tidal amplitudes even under quiet condition of geomagnetic activity as observed by lidar. We also found that the tides propagating from the lower atmosphere is a minor factor for the fast increase of thermospheric diurnal tides in Antarctica.",

            "abstract": "These days many geophysicists have been working not only for oil and gas exploration but also for CO2 monitoring for CCS (Carbon Capture and storage). When CO2 is injected and stored to the target layer, it changes the physical properties of subsurface media like p-wave velocity, density and so on. Seismic method is one of the most widely used geophysical methods for CO2 monitoring, because it can delineate physical properties of subsurface media. To prevent CO2 from leaking out of reservoirs, most target areas require caprocks, and shale often acts as a caprock. However, shale has a strong anisotropic property. Without considering the anisotropic property of subsurface media, interpretations of seismic monitoring data can distort the CO2distribution or movement in the subsurface media. For computational efficiency, seismic data interpretation based on acoustic VTI (Vertical Transversely Isotropic) wave equations has been commonly done although it does not consider the shear waves.\nTo investigate the importance of considering anisotropic properties in acoustic FWI (full waveform inversion) for CO2 monitoring, we compare results obtained by the acoustic VTI FWI with those of the conventional acoustic FWI for isotropic case in the frequency domain. Both methods are based on the node-based finite-element method. Numerical examples show that neglecting anisotropic properties of subsurface media can distort distribution of CO2 and degrade reliability of subsurface image obtained by FWI.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the Human Resources Development program (No. 20134010200510) of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP) grant funded by the Korean government Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy and by the “Development of Technology for CO2 Marine Geological Storage” grant funded by the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries of Korea.",

Precipitation was remarkable in that similar depths fell at all elevations from forest-grassland valley bottom to mid-elevation montane forest to alpine ridge-top and started with relatively warm conditions even at high elevations (6 oC), turning to snowfall at the highest elevations towards the end of the event. Snowfall in the alpine zone of the basin is highly redistributed by wind and forms deep drifts on lee slopes and in tree-line forests. These snowdrifts persist into summer and form a critical water supply for the creek. Snow surveys six days before and one day after the event show alpine snowdrift water equivalent declining from 350 to 150 mm and snow-covered area declining from 97% to 55% The snowpack ablation of 120 mm during the heavy precipitation period enhanced water delivery to alpine surfaces from rainfall by 50%. The event was simulated using the modular, physically-based Cold Regions Hydrological Model which was set up here to include a blowing snow model and infiltration to frozen soil model coupled to the SNOBAL energy balance snowmelt model. The results show substantially slower snowmelt rates during the rain-on-snow (ROS) event than before or after the ROS. ROS was characterized by greatly reduced solar irradiance, which was not compensated for by increased net longwave radiation, advected heat from rainfall and small but consistently downward fluxes of sensible and latent heat. Turbulent fluxes did not drive melt as has been suggested for more temperate ROS melts and energy sources can be ranked as K*>L*>Qa>Qh>Qe>>Qg. Nevertheless the combination of rainfall, snowmelt and frozen soils caused alpine snowdrifts to be a ‘hot spot’ for runoff generation during the flood. The distinctive character of this ROS event occurring near summer solstice and with relatively cool atmospheric conditions meant that melt rates were not enhanced by ROS, but snowmelt during ROS was an important contributor to alpine streamflow.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol emission by the anthropogenic source has increased in the 20th century and the effects on climate have received much attention for understanding of historical climate change. Aerosols contribute to change solar radiation at the surface directly and indirectly enhance radiative effect through cloud properties changes, altering surface climate and large-scale atmospheric circulation as well. In East Asia, as anthropogenic emissions increased sharply in industrialized areas, many studies have shown the effect of aerosols on East Asian summer monsoon related to changes in land sea thermal contrast, while studies on the wintertime climate response are few. Climatologically he East Asian winter monsoon is controlled by the intensification of Siberian high and the deepening of Aleutian low which are attributed to higher east-west surface pressure gradient and strong northerly wind. We are interested in the wintertime surface climate change affected by past aerosol emissions.\nThis study uses historical simulations of seven ensemble members by the HadGEM2-AO developed by the UK Met Office. Contrasting with the historical runs, the fixed aerosol experiments are performed where aerosol emissions are held fixed at 1860 levels.\nAs the emissions increase, simulations shows decrease in wintertime land surface temperature, increase in MSLP over the land and northerly wind speeds. In order to understand the circulation changes, we analyze direct and indirect aerosol influences and the results are presented.\nAcknowledgement: This research is supported by a project, “NIMR-2012-B-2(Development and Application of Methodology for Climate Change Prediction)”.",

            "abstract": "In order to study the behavior of the crust in different regions and over time, it remains important to be able to quantify the pressure (P) and temperature (T) conditions of metamorphism in exhumed rocks. The recently developed technique, known as “Titanium-in-quartz” (TitaniQ) shows particular promise as both a geothermometer and geobarometer, because it focuses on one of the most abundant minerals on Earth—quartz—and it can thus be applied to a very wide range of rock types. Despite the potential of TitaniQ, two aspects of the technique remain poorly understood. Firstly, the two most recently developed calibrations predict Ti concentrations that differ by close to a factor of three at the same temperature. Secondly, the effect of deformation on Ti re-equilibration at temperatures where static diffusion is sluggish is debated. We address these aspects of the TitaniQ thermobarometer by applying the technique to a suite of rocks in the Santa Rosa mylonite zone of eastern California that were deformed and metamorphosed at known P-T conditions.\nThe Santa Rosa mylonite zone is a 100-km-long Cretaceous ductile thrust system that juxtaposes deformed metasedimentary rocks (P = 3-5 kbar, T = 600-800 C) known as the Palm Canyon Series in the hanging wall against mylonitized granodiorites (P 4-5 kbar, T = 400-550) of the Peninsular Ranges Batholith in the footwall. The Palm Canyon series includes quartzites, amphibolites and garnet-mica schists, most of which contain titanite as the primary Ti-bearing phase. We measure Ti concentrations in several samples from this unit to see whether they are consistent among different rock types and whether calibrations of the TitaniQ thermobarometer match the P-T conditions constrained by mineral assemblages. The granodiorites show a distinct strain gradient developed over approximately one kilometer as they are incorporated into the Santa Rosa mylonite zone; they range from weakly deformed at the shear zone margin to ultramylonitic in the shear zone core. We examine Ti concentrations in rocks collected across this strain gradient to determine the degree to which progressive strain (accommodated by pervasive dynamic recrystallization) can redistribute Ti in quartz.",

This master variable has been impaired by human activities like dam operations, water diversions, and flood control infrastructure. Furthermore, increasing water scarcity due to rising water demands and droughts has further stressed these systems, calling for the need to find better ways to identify and allocate environmental flows. In this study, a linear optimization model was developed for environmental flows in river systems that have minimal or no regulation from dam operations, but still exhibit altered flow regimes due to surface water diversions and groundwater abstraction. Flow regime requirements for California Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) life history were used as a test case to examine how alterations to the timing and magnitude of water diversions meet environmental flow objectives while minimizing impact to local water supply. The model was then applied to Mill Creek, a tributary of the Sacramento River, in northern California, and its altered flow regime that currently impacts adult spring-run Chinook spawning and migration. The resulting optimized water diversion schedule can be used to inform water management decisions that aim to maximize benefit for the environment while meeting local water demands.",

However, their results show that it still can not reduce parameter uncertainty effectively and even can not perform good water storage simulation in hydrological models in some study areas. The objective of this study was to calibrate and evaluate a semi-distributed hydrological based on the Hydrological Predictions for the Environment (HYPE) code for main part of Red river basin in South-East Asia using five year(2002-2006) GRACE data and multi-site river discharge data. The analysis was conducted in a step-wise calibration method using Differential Evolution Monte Carlo Markov Chain simulation framework. Comparing to calibrating model with multiobjective method, this approach efficiently reduce parameter uncertainty in our model, in the meanwhile, model can perform good discharge simulation and reasonable water storage simulation. We also find that based on this method, our model can enhance potential evapotranspiration simulation in subbasin scale. More important, this study has demonstrated the potential for the joint use of routinely available GRACE water storage data and streamflow records to improve main hydrological flux simulations in the hydrological model.",

            "abstract": "Microseismic analysis is recognized as the main method for estimating hydraulic fracture geometry. However, because of limited access to the subsurface and usually high levels of environmental noise it becomes crucial to verify assumed fracture propagation models under more controlled laboratory conditions. Considering the fact that fluid driven fractures may grow under different regimes i.e., toughness-dominated or viscous-dominated, scaling is necessary to reproduce the corresponding fracture growth regime. Scaling is achieved by constraining material deformational parameters, fluid flow rates, and fracturing-fluid viscosity for the appropriate value of the non-dimensional toughness.\nHence, we implemented hydraulic fracturing tests on translucent plexiglass samples, at room temperature with contrasting fracturing fluid viscosities. A modest, biaxial loading frame creates relatively low directed principal stresses (< 1000 psi, or less < 1 km overburden pressure). A sealed fluid conduit generates fluid pressures (< 3000 psi) created by a positive displacement pump. We record microseismic events on the upper and lower faces of a thermally annealed, sample block (13 cm x 13 cm x 10 cm) with 3-component, broadband sensors (101-106). Preliminary results indicate that the dominant frequency band of the microseismic events appears similar for both toughness-dominated and viscous-dominated regimes (101-102 Hz). The experiments in both regimes show rippled crack surfaces although in the toughness-dominated regime, ‘ripples’ are more closely spaced (mm cf. cm). The fracture surfaces show bifurcating, “wish-bone” structures only in the viscous regime.",

            "abstract": "In many methods of the present Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) systems, hypocenter and magnitude are determined quickly and then strengths of ground motions are predicted. The 2011 Tohoku Earthquake (MW9.0), however, revealed some technical issues with the conventional methods: under-prediction due to the large extent of the fault rupture, and over-prediction due to confusion of the system by multiple aftershocks occurred simultaneously. To address these issues, a new concept is proposed for EEW: applying data assimilation technique, present wavefield is estimated precisely in real time (real-time shake mapping) and then future wavefield is predicted time-evolutionally using physical process of seismic wave propagation. Information of hypocenter location and magnitude are not required, which is basically different from the conventional method.\nIn the proposed method, data assimilation technique is applied to estimate the current spatial distribution of wavefield, in which not only actual observation but also anticipated wavefield predicted from one time-step before are used. Real-time application of the data assimilation technique enables us to estimate wavefield in real time, which corresponds to real-time shake mapping. Once present situation is estimated precisely, we go forward to the prediction of future situation using simulation of wave propagation.\nThe proposed method is applied to the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake (MW9.0) and the 2004 Mid-Niigata earthquake (Mw6.7). Future wavefield is precisely predicted, and the prediction is improved with shortening the lead time: for example, the error of 10 s prediction is smaller than that of 20 s, and that of 5 s is much smaller. By introducing this method, it becomes possible to predict ground motion precisely even for cases of the large extent of fault rupture and the multiple simultaneous earthquakes.\nThe proposed method is based on a simulation of physical process from the precisely estimated present condition. This method, therefore, corresponds to “numerical shake prediction”, on the analogy to “numerical weather prediction” in meteorology.",

Jakarta is located in Java Island, Indonesia, with a population over 10 million. Overall 96 points were sampled through the successive deployments of 52 seismic broadband sensors at different parts of the city. After recording continuous seismic data for 5 months, the network was shifted to Bandung, another city to the south-east of Jakarta on March 2014. Bandung is situated on a old lake deposit surrounded by volcanic provinces. The configuration of the seismic network at Bandung encompasses the whole city as well as an active volcano-Tangkuban Perahu and Lembang Fault both located just outside of the city.\nIn both of the experiments, oceanic and anthropogenic noise were recorded as well as local and regional earthquakes. We apply regularized deconvolution to the recorded data of the vertical components of available station pairs, and over 4000 Green's functions were retrieved in total. Waveforms from stacked interstation deconvolutions show clear arrivals of Rayleigh and body waves. The traveltimes that were extracted from the group velocity filtering of Rayleigh wave arrivals, are used in a Transdimensional Bayesian seismic tomography method to map the velocity perturbations across cities. The constructed images at Jakarta mark the very low group velocities of Rayleigh waves, as low as 150 m/s at 1 Hz showing influence of a very low velocity basin. Low seismic velocity regions imaged through seismic noise tomography beneath both cities potentially posses a large risk of causing seismic amplification during a large earthquake close to the cities.",

Yumul (2007, Island Arc) defined four belts in the Philippine ophiolites and proposed that they progressively become younger towards west, from Early – Late Cretaceous at the easternmost belt to Eocene - Oligocene in the west. However, most of the ophiolitic complexes have been dated by radiolarians and foraminifera in the overlying sediments.\nTo precisely determine the igneous ages of the Philippine ophiolites, we have conducted SHRIMP zircon U-Pb dating of the gabbroic and leucocratic rocks collected from the ophiolitic complexes in the Philippine Islands, including those from Luzon (Zambales and Isabela ophiolites), Masbate (Balud ophiolite), Tablas (Sibuyan Ophiolite), and Cebu. New zircon ages show that all of the ages obtained so far from the eastern ophiolite belts are Eocene in age, from 52 Ma to 41 Ma. These ages coincide well with the opening of the West Philippine Basin (49 – 33 Ma, Taylor and Goodliffe, 2004 JGR), which is a backarc basin formed behind the incipient IBM Arc. Furthermore, geochemical data available from the igneous rocks in the eastern ophiolite belts show backarc basin basalt-like geochemical affinities (e.g. Yumul, 2007), suggesting that these ophiolites are genetically associated with the West Philippine Basin. On the contrary, gabbroic and leucocratic rocks that are associated with the ophiolitic complex in Cebu are Late Cretaceous (~90 Ma) in age, significantly older than those in the eastern ophiolite belts, suggesting a different origin.",

            "abstract": "Within the critical zone on montane hillslopes of Colorado’s Front Range, qualitative observations suggest that gophers not only dominate the modern meadow geomorphic rates, but are involved in a geomorphic-ecological feedback system that governs meadow migration on decadal-millennial time scales. Our observations suggest that gopher intensity and location is pertinent to forest/meadow (FM) dynamics. Field mapping of gopher activity as the snow melts in the spring revealed that subnivean tubes (“eskers”) are tightly clustered at the FM boundary while mounds generated over the remainder of the summer are concentrated strictly in the meadows. This suggests that gophers spend the winter months at the FM interface and spend the warmer seasons within the meadows. We hypothesize that variations in snow depth drive this spatial-temporal pattern of gopher activity; deeper snow near the FM boundary provides greater insulation, as near-surface ground temperatures in the wind-scoured meadow centers are colder. This motivates our initiation of monitoring and modeling of near-surface temperature across a FM pair. Numerical modeling supports qualitative observations that the following geomorphic-ecological processes are active: seedling establishment and damage, gopher tunneling and resulting mound generation, mound material transport driven by ungulate trampling, vegetative lock-down of mound material, and resulting changes in the soil depth of the landscape. This year’s observations suggest that we must add to this mix the annual cycle of the gopher activity. Finally, probing and soil pits within the meadows reveal that on longer timescales gopher activity leads to the development of a well-mixed upper soil layer that is sharply bounded below by high concentrations of large stones (“stone lines”) within the glacial till substrate of the hillslopes. The mean diameter of mound surface grains is half that of clasts comprising the stone lines. This motivates documentation of soil mixing rates utilizing the short-lived bomb isotope 137Cs, which in turn will further constrain numerical modeling of the gopher-geomorphic system.",

            "abstract": "The potential of methane hydrate deposits in the Ulleung Basin of the Korean East Sea was suggested by the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources between 2000 and 2004. In a few years, a pilot production project is planned as the world’s second offshore methane production project. The basin has a water depth of 1500-2300 m; however, the depth of the hydrate occurrence zone is relatively shallow (about 100-200 mbsf) for gas hydrate production. There is high potential for geomechanical stability problems such as seafloor subsidence, differential settlement, effective stress concentrations, marine landslides, and wellbore instability. In this study, 2D axisymmetric numerical modeling is conducted to simulate the depressurization process in the Ulleung Basin for methane gas production. The coupled mechanical-flow-thermal model used for this purpose incorporates the physical processes of hydrate dissociation, the pore fluid flow, thermal advection, and the geomechanical response of hydrate-bearing sediments. Using the coupled model, two high-potential sites are compared with respect to the pore pressure, temperature change, production efficiency, and geomechanical stability. During depressurization, deformation of the sediments around the production well occurs due to the pore pressure difference and the increase in the effective stress in the depressurized region. This tendency becomes more pronounced due to the decrease in the stiffness of the hydrate-bearing sediments, which is caused by hydrate dissociation. In addition, the latent heat induced by methane hydrate dissociation and thermal advection due to the pore fluid flow have greater effects on the dissociation range and pace than do the geomechanical behaviors. Meanwhile, higher production efficiency, a larger latent heat effect and less settlement are induced in the site, which consists of thick sand layers with greater stiffness and permeability levels than mud layers.",

            "abstract": "A synoptic, regional downscaling experiment of Kuroshio off Ryukyu Islands, Japan, exhibits the evident predominance of submesoscale anticyclonic eddies over cyclones in the narrow strip between Kuroshio and the islands (Uchiyama et al., 2013). In the present study, the mechanism and impacts of the anticyclone dominance are examined with a detailed oceanic downscaling model in a double nested ROMS configuration at the horizontal resolution of 3km (ROMS-L1) and 1km (ROMS-L2), forced by the assimilative JCOPE2 oceanic reanalysis and the JMA GPV-MSM atmospheric hindcast. The model results are extensively validated against a variety of data including shipboard hydrography and satellite altimetry and temperature data to show a good agreement. An alternative ROMS-L2 experiment is also conducted to examine topographic effects on the anticyclones around the Ryukyu Islands by eliminating all the island topography above z > -1000 m, while the other configurations are held unchanged. If the islands are removed, the submesoscale negative vortices on the eastern side of the Kuroshio become much weaker than those of the original case with the islands. The experiment clearly demonstrates that dominance of the negative vorticity between Kuroshio and the Ryukyu Islands is caused by enhanced lateral shear due to the concentrated Kuroshio mean current associated with appropriate formation of the eastern branch, the northward-drifting Ryuku Current, and resultant eddy shedding in the narrow channel between the continental shelf of the East China Sea and the Okinawan ridge. A diagnostic eddy heat flux analysis illustrates that the submesoscale anticyclonic eddies play a crucial role in enhancing the eddy heat transport and thus the lateral mixing between Kuroshio and the islands as compared to those in the coarser resolution models (L1 and JCOPE2), resulting in promoting regional larval and material transport from Kuroshio to the islands.",

            "abstract": "A 300 km deep seismic reflection profile across the middle and lower Yangtze River metallogenic belt (YRMB) and its adjacent areas established the architecture and geodynamic framework of the region. Results based on the interpretation of the deep seismic data include the deep complicated geometry of the Tan-Lu fault and Zhangbaling uplift, appears as a subvertical thrust fault with its deep portion dip toward the southeast, and along which the Zhangbaling uplift is squeezed out; complex upper crust deformation structure beneath Chuquan depression, within which there are both kink bands, thrusts, imbrication and fold structures reflecting contraction deformation, and detachment fault and normal-fault structures reflecting extensional deformation; the “crocodile” reflection structure emerging beneath the Tan-Lu fault and Ningwu–Lishui volcanic basin, i.e., the upper crust reflection thrust upward, and the lower crust reflection thrust downward and offsetting the Moho discontinuity, which reflects the decoupled deformation process of the upper and lower crust, and is interpreted as an intracontinental subduction. Further to the southeast, the upper crust deformation shows a large-scale “wave-form” pattern, making crustal scale syncline and anticline. The entire section of the reflection Moho is clearly discernible at depth of 30.0–34.5 km, and the Moho beneath the YRMB is shallowest, while the Moho beneath the North China block is deeper than that beneath the Yangtze block. Moho offsets could be seen beneath the Ningwu volcanic basin.\nOverall, the seismic data show evidence for an intracontinental orogeny and imposes constraints on the deep geodynamic model applied to study region. Our interpretation of seismic profile supports the view that the Yanshanian orogeny, due to the northwest subduction of the paleo-Pacific plate during the Middle–Late Jurassic, is the major event that shaped the tectonic framework of the region. A geodynamic model is proposed for the formation of the world-class metallogenic belt, this model includes several key deep processes, e.g., the subduction of intracontinental sublithosphere, the thickening and delamination of crustal roots, the melting of delaminated lower crust and underplating of the melts to the crust-mantle boundary and subsequent MASH processes.",

            "abstract": "There is a growing recognition among secondary educators and administrators that students need to have a science education that provides connections between familiar classes like biology, chemistry, and physics. Because of this waxing interest in an integrative approach to the sciences, there is a broader push for school districts to offer classes geared towards the earth sciences, a field that incorporates knowledge and skills gleaned from the three core science subjects. Within the contexts of a regular secondary school day on a traditional schedule (45- to 50-minute long classes), it is challenging to engage students in rigorous field-based learning, critical for students to develop a deeper understanding of geosciences content, without requiring extra time outside of the regular schedule. We suggest instruction using common, manmade features like drainage retention ponds to model good field practices and provide students with the opportunity to calculate basic hydrologic budgets, take pH readings, and, if in an area with seasonal rainfall, make observations regarding soils by way of trenching, and near-surface processes, including mass wasting and the effects of vegetation on geomorphology. Gains in student understanding are discussed by analyzing the difference in test scores between exams provided to the students after they had received only in-class instruction, and after they had received field instruction in addition to the in-class lectures. In an advanced setting, students made measurements regarding ion contents and pollution that allowed the classes to practice lab skills while developing a data set that was analyzed after field work was completed. It is posited that similar fieldwork could be an effective approach at an introductory level in post-secondary institutions.",

We developed a portable, in-situ permeameter that works in streambeds characterized by a range of soil particle sizes. The device uses an Arduino controller to drive a pump that establishes a varying pressure head across the medium of interest. This requires a secure seal between the streambed and permeameter housing. Much of our effort was devoted to establishing this seal using unconventional means, including castable ultra-soft rubber. We determine relative permeability using both the difference in amplitude between the measured pressure gradient and that given by the hydrostatic forces of the fluid column, as well as the phase shift between the hydrostatic forcing and the responding pressure as characterized by Darcian flow through the permeable medium. We consider it notable that the data acquisition, control and fluid delivery system could equally be employed as a well-mounted permeameter for small wells, lab permeability tests in cores, as well as air permeability tests in snow and soil.",

            "abstract": "Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques are widely used as practical tools to select superior projects/alternatives in water resources. However, parameter uncertainty (e.g., uncertainty in weights and performances) can significantly affects their performance in such a way that making a robust decision is too much difficult for a decision-maker. Thus, it is necessary to evaluate the effect of uncertainty on ranking of alternative decisions in order to reduce the possibility of failure in selecting a robust decision. In this study, we develop a novel probabilistic methodology for sensitivity analysis of a MCDM model to determine the robustness in decisions considering uncertainty in parameters. The proposed methodology which is developed based on Advanced First Order Second Moment (AFOSM) method estimates both performance and the probability of failure in ranking of alternatives. This provides additional information for decision makers to select a superior alternative with minimum risk of failure. This technique is applied to two case studies in water resources which previously evaluated using Weighted Sum Model (WSM), and the results are compared with those obtained from alternative sensitivity analysis methods, such as Monte Carlo based sensitivity analysis techniques. The results show that the proposed method improves the results of Multi-criteria analysis for water resources problem by providing additional information about the robustness and risk of failure in rank of alternatives when it is compared with other sensitivity analysis methods.",

We investigate the representation of ozone precursors within the CMAQ (Community Multi-scale Air Quality) air quality model, with a focus on assessing how well the model represents NOx and HOx chemistry. A comprehensive set of atmospheric observations for which OPE can be found and HO2 and RO2can be inferred, is available from NASA’s DISCOVER-AQ campaign for July 2011 in the Baltimore-Washington region. Preliminary results show that the OPE as well as the NOx/NOy ratio in the Baltimore-Washington region derived from measurements is twice as high as within CMAQ, and that isoprene and formaldehyde are too low within CMAQ.

            "abstract": "Within the stable continental region of Australia, the Flinders Ranges stands out as experiencing concentrated and prolonged seismic activity. Previous studies have shown that strain rates inferred from seismicity of 10-16 —10-15 s-1 are similar to neotectonic slip rates inferred for range-bounding faults. It is also an area of relatively pronounced topography up to 1700 m and high heat flow averaging 90 mW/m2. For these reasons the Flinders Ranges have been the subject of many studies trying to understand why deformation of the Australian continent appears to be localized there, with explanations including erosion-driven isostatic rebound, lithospheric flexure, stress concentration due to change in lithospheric strength, and thermal weakening. We present a hypothesis for localized, intraplate deformation in the continental crust of south-central Australia that involves fluid-assisted reactivation of faults in the mid- to lower crust. This study utilizes data from a temporary seismometer deployment in the Flinders Ranges from 2003—2005. We show that earthquakes in the region extend to depths of 20 km and are clustered in elongated low Vp/Vs anomalies. These anomalies suggest a highly fractured or deformed zone that is aligned with the axis of the Flinders Ranges and extends to the lower crust. We argue that the compressive earthquake focal mechanisms are consistent with the regional stress field, that there is no evidence for stress concentration, and that the occurrence of earthquakes at mid- to lower crustal depth in an area of high heat flow can only be explained by high pore fluid pressure in the lower crust. These data reveal important constraints on structure, rheology, and stress that are crucial for understanding intraplate deformation in the Flinders Ranges, with possible implications for high-seismicity zones in stable continental regions elsewhere.",

            "abstract": "Unlike previous space-borne Earth-observing sensors, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) employs aggregation to reduce downlink bandwidth requirements and preserve spatial resolution across the swath. To examine the potentially deleterious impacts of aggregation when encountering detector saturation, nearly four months of NOAA’s Nightfire product were analyzed, which contains a subset of the hottest observed nighttime pixels. An empirical method for identifying saturation was devised. The 3.69 µm band (M12) was the most frequently-saturating band with 0.15% of the Nightfire pixels at or near the ~359 K hard saturation limit, with possible saturation also occurring in M14, M15, and M16. Artifacts consistent with detector saturation were seen with M12 temperatures as low as 330 K in the scene center. This partial saturation and aggregation influence must be considered when using VIIRS radiances for quantitative characterization of hot emission sources such as fires and gas flaring.",

            "abstract": "There are a variety of methods to assess the strength of individual feedback processes in numerical climate models. Generally these methods compute, in some form, the ratio of free- and fixed-feedback temperature anomalies when the model is subjected to forcing (e.g., by a doubling of CO2). However, these ratios (gains) are often sensitive to the overall shape of the applied forcing. For example, an ocean-atmosphere coupled model subjected to an equatorially amplified forcing will result in different gains and feedback factors (both global and local) than the same model subjected to a polar amplified forcing.\nWe discuss a new, more general method of feedback analysis that results in\nn×n\nfeedback and gain matrices where\nn\nis the resolution of the model. These matrices generalize (both globally and locally) the classically defined numerical gains and feedback factors and are independent of the applied forcing. The gain matrix, in particular, is shown to reveal, under any forcing scenario, the global pattern by which a given feedback process amplifies or dampens fixed-feedback temperature anomalies. Moreover, in the case of a feedback process that is not purely a function of local temperature, these matrices will show the degree to which this “local feedback process” depends on non-local perturbations. We apply this method in the context of a simple box model as well as a one-dimensional energy balance climate model.",

            "abstract": "The importance of plant roots in carbon cycling and especially soil organic matter (SOM) formation and decomposition has been recently recognized. Up to eighty percent of net primary production may be allocated to roots in ecosystems such as grasslands, where they contribute substantially to SOM formation. On the other hand, root induced priming of SOM decomposition has been implicated in the loss of soil C stocks. Thus, the accurate prediction of climate change impacts on C sequestration in soils largely depends upon improved understanding of root-mediated SOM formation and loss in the rhizosphere. This presentation represents an initial attempt to synthesize belowground observations from free-air CO2 enrichment and warming experiments in two grassland ecosystems. We found that the chemical composition of root carbon is similar to particulate organic matter (POM), but not to mineral associated organic matter (MOM), suggesting less microbial modification during formation of POM than MOM. While root biomass and production rates increased under elevated CO2, POM and MOM fractions did not increase proportionally. We also observed increased root decomposition with elevated CO2, which was likely due to increased soil water and substrate availability, since root C quality (determined by NMR) and decomposition (in laboratory incubations) were unaltered. Further, C quality and decomposition rates of roots differed between C3 and C4 functional types. Changes in root morphology with elevated CO2 have altered root functioning. Increased root surface area and length per unit mass allow increased exploration for nutrients, and potentially enhanced root exudation, rhizodeposition, and priming of SOM decomposition. Controlled chamber experiments demonstrated that uptake of N from SOM was linearly correlated with specific root length. Taken together, these results indicate that root morphology, chemistry and function all play roles in affecting soil C storage and loss, and that these properties are altered by climate change and by species composition in grasslands. Ecosystem C cycling models can be improved by incorporating root-mediated mechanisms of plant community dynamics, nutrient uptake, priming of SOM decomposition, and rhizodeposition to SOM pools.",

            "abstract": "Gallium has a rare water-ice type P-V-T phase diagram in which the density of Ga melt exceeds by about 3 % that of the stable solid Ga phase I at ambient pressure. Liquid gallium, which is easily supercooled, can remain in a metastable liquid state for several months at ambient pressure. A rich polymorphism and metastable modifications of Ga have been discovered in P-T domain. There are a number of studies of liquid gallium under high pressure conditions, but some fundamental properties, such as the equation of state (EoS) of liquid Ga under extreme conditions remain unclear. Very recently, the advanced pair distribution function (PDF) method in which synchrotron high-energy x-ray total scattering data, combined with reverse Monte Carlo simulation, was used to study the microstructure and EoS of liquid gallium under high pressure conditions. However, the application of PDF method for amorphous or liquid samples under pressure conditions normally required a priori knowledge of their EoS. The density estimation from the reverse Monte Carlo simulation with the best mathematical fit to the measured structure factor data could cause big errors if it is calculated without knowing the EoS. In the paper, the volume change of liquid and solid gallium have been studied as a function of pressure and temperature up to 3.63 GPa using synchrotron x-ray microtomography combined with energy dispersive x-ray diffraction (EDXRD) techniques. Two sets of directly measured P-V data at 300 K and 330 K were obtained from 3D tomography reconstruction data. The existence of a liquid-liquid phase transition region is proposed based on the abnormal compressibility of Ga melt at about 2.44 GPa and 330 K conditions.",

Recently, the active studies for the characteristics of HULIS in the atmospheric particles have been progressed due to possibility of significant contribution to the climate change both directly and indirectly (Graber and Rudich, 2006 ; Dinar et al., 2008). However, still there is a lack of reliable information on the amount and characteristics of HULIS in the aerosol. In this study, we will study contribution of HULIS-C concentrations in WSOC of urban aerosol and characterize origin and formation of HULIS in aerosol.\nFour sampling periods were selected for fall (4 October to 4 November in 2012), winter (9 January to 8 February in 2013), spring (1 April to 30 April in 2013), and summer (13 August to 10 September in 2013) to investigate characteristics of HULIS-C and WSOC. The measurements of PM2.5 using high volume air sampler was made at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (37.60°N, 127.05°E) at Seoul, representative urban site, Korea. 15cm2 of each PM2.5 sample filters were extracted with 40 mL of ultrapure water (18.2MΩ) in ultrasonic bath for 60 min. The extracts were filtered with a 0.20 mm Teflon filter (PTFE, Hydrophilic, Advantec). 20mL of extracts was used for the HULIS analysis and other was used for the WSOC analysis. HULIS fraction was extracted using the solid phase extraction and WSOC and HULIS-C were analyzed using total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer. More details on the analytical methods can be found in Lin et al. (2010) and Yang et al. (2003).",

            "abstract": "Barmah-Millewa Forest (BMF), the largest River Red Gum forest in the world, located in south-eastern Australia is suffering from severe dieback, thus diminishing its ecological and economical value. Previous research showed that dieback is a good predictor of the forest health and stressed the need for BMF health mapping and change monitoring. In this respect, airborne laser scanning and hyperspectral imaging offer extensive spatial and spectral coverage of measurements and represent an ideal tool for forest health mapping at individual tree scale. The aim of this project is to quantify the health of individual, structurally complex floodplain eucalypt trees by integrating airborne hyperspectral imagery, full-waveform laser scans and field measurements. An aerial survey, conducted in May 2014, was designed to provide a representative sample of BMF tree health. The positioning of 17 flight lines aimed to capture the heterogeneity of the forest health and flood frequency. Preliminary analysis of the aerial remote sensing data with regards to chlorophyll concentrations, dieback levels and canopy densities allowed us to target our field campaign (conducted in June 2014). Field measurements included accurate position measurements, LAI, visual assessment, spectral measurement and mensuration of individual trees in 30 m2 plots. For detection of individual tree trunks from airborne laser scans we used a novel approach based on Euclidean distance clustering, taking advantage of the intensity and pulse width difference between woody and leaf tree compartments. The detected trunks were used to seed a minimum cut algorithm for tree crown delineation. In situ measurements confirmed the high structural diversity of the forest and allowed the calibration of the tree detection algorithm. An overall accuracy of the tree detection of 54% and 67% was achieved for trees with circumference over 40 cm and over 100 cm respectively. As a further step, 3D point clusters representing individual trees were used in conjunction with hyperspectral imagery to assess tree health in more detail. The detailed floodplain eucalypt tree health map, derived from aerial remote sensing data, will be further extrapolated to the whole forest using WorldView-2 imagery to produce a seamless, high resolution health map of the entire forest.",

Various LWD (Logging While Drilling) and wireline logging have been carried out in many expeditions and for various purposes. Significant features of logging in Chikyu expeditions are many use of LWD than wireline logging, and riser dirlling. riser selected specific tools for each scientific target, and 3) carried out various borehole experiments.\nLWD has been more popular than wireline logging in Chikyu expeditions, because its advantages match theirs science targets. The advantages are followings. 1) LWD has more opportunities for measurement in unstable borehole, such as in the series of Nankai trough drilling expeditions. 2) LWD realtime data allows us to make realtime interpretation and operational decision. Realtime interpretation was required to set obsevartory at the properposition. 3) LWD before coring allows us to make a strategy of spot coring.We can design coring intervals for our interest and core length to improve core recovery.\nRiser drilling brings us merits for logging. One is hole stability (good hole condition) and the other is the use of large diameter tools. Controled drilling mud in riser drilling system prevent mud invasion to formation and mitigates collapse of borehole wall. They reduce the risk of tool stack and improve data quality. Large diameter of riser pipe enhances variation of tool seizes. A couple of new tools were used for new measurement and improvement of the data quality. For example, SonicScanner (trademark of Schulumberger) successfully measured compressional and share velocity in very low velocities at the soft sediment, where it has been difficult to measure them with conventional DSI tool (Exp319). The stress and pore pressure in the borehole were measured with the wireline logging tool, (Schlumberger MDT). The single probe tool enable to measure temporal formation fluid pressure. The double packer tool enable to fracture test by sealing and pumping in the borehole. These in-situ measurement and stress experiment data are very important to understand physical properties and mechanism of fault zone (Exp319).\nThose new technologies and tools also expand the envelope of scientific ocean drilling.",

Differences in surface climate, precipitation, and circulation in climate models may depend on where they situate this boundary.\nIn this study, climate model grid size is found to bias the mean width of the tropical belt, with finer horizontal resolution leading to a narrower tropical belt width. Three objective diagnostics – based on the Hadley circulation, the subtropical jet streams, and the subtropical tropopause break – are used to assess this bias. Horizontal resolution explains up to 50% of the intermodel variation in the tropical belt width in 25 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and 17 Chemistry-Climate Model Validation Activity 2 (CCMVal-2) models, with evidence that the relationship is strongest in high-top models and models with interactive chemistry. An analysis of the CCMVal-2 models reveals that an equatorward shift in the eddy momentum flux divergence at the poleward flanks of the Hadley cells is associated with both finer horizontal resolution and a narrower tropical belt. This suggests changes to the eddy fluxes and their balanced meridional flow as a possible mechanism for this grid size bias, and illustrates how a basic property of a model's dynamical core can influence its mean climate.\nNo other tropical belt width biases were found, suggesting that the processes biasing the poleward shift of the midlatitude jets in climate models do not similarly influence the Hadley cells or subtropical jets.",

Only TGFs detected with the VLF radio networks WWLLN and ENTLN are used, thereby reducing the TGF location error from over 300 km to ~10 km. This results in a sample of 877 TGFs. We begin by identifying incidences of temporal and spatial FOV coincidence between LIS and the TGF sample and then investigate those at the LIS Group and Flash levels. Two incidences of FOV coincidence are found, TGF120124320a and TGF120524874, each of which has one or more LIS flashes. However, the flashes are either too far away in position or time to be convincing associations considering the TGF location uncertainties and our understanding of the TGF-lightning relationship.

It is still, however, difficult to anticipate how large or explosive is an eruption is likely to be. Moreover, we have very limited instrumental evidence for the precursory signs of Plinian eruptions. At a volcano that is known to have a history of moderate size events (VEI 3 - 4) interspersed with several VEI≥6 events, how do we prepare when the volcano enters into a period of unrest? Is it possible to isolate key activity that may indicate that this event is more or less likely to be a large, explosive event? Is there a recipe for Plinian eruptions? In this study we have compiled evidence of instrumental and non-instrumental data from 14 Plinian historical eruptions (including 23 different criteria) to isolate any common features of large explosive eruptions. We looked at: eruption prerequisites (e.g., repose time, presence of an exsolved gas phase, viscosity, and volatile gradients), additional conditions that must develop (fresh intrusions, magma mixing, ascent rates), Plinian potential (evidence of past Plinian eruptions, shear within the conduit, high magmatic volatiles) and finally any observed precursors that in combination may indicate a imminent Plinian eruption (seismicity: deep Long Period, Distal Volcano Tectonic earthquakes, high energy / long duration earthquake swarms, deformation: pronounced or prolonged inflation). Given the limted number of historical plinian eruptions, we supplemented our data set and conclusions with data from more than 30 other analogous volcanoes with subplinian events. We combine these datasets to look for commonalities to provide better – constrained probabilities for large (VEI≥6) eruptions.\nInitial findings show that for 50% of the Plinian eruptions studied there is evidence of an exsolved gas phase. We also find that at least 58% of Plinian eruptions are preceded by phreatomagmatic eruptions that contain juvenile material and that in 78% of cases there is significant seismicity that increased in intensity prior to the eruption.",

However, it is impossible to estimate the geochemical environment for the longer time scale than the groundwater residence time in this method. In this case, analysis of the chemical properties of secondary minerals are one of useful method to estimate the paleohydrochemical conditions (temperature, salinity, pH and redox potential). In particular, carbonate minerals would be available to infer the long-term evolution of hydrochemical for the following reasons;\n-it easily reaches chemical equilibrium with groundwater and precipitates in open space of water flowing path\n-it reflects the chemical and isotopic composition of groundwater at the time of crystallization\nWe reviewed the previous studies on carbonate minerals and geochemical conditions in deep underground and estimated the hydrochemical characteristics of past groundwater by using carbonate minerals. As a result, it was found that temperature and salinity of the groundwater during crystallization of carbonate minerals were evaluated quantitatively. On the other hand, pH and redox potential can only be understood qualitatively. However, it is suggested that the content of heavy metal elements such as manganese, iron and uranium, and rare earth elements in the carbonate minerals are useful indicators for estimating redox potential.\nThis study was carried out under a contract with METI (Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry) as part of its R&D supporting program for developing geological disposal technology.",

            "abstract": "Testing different Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary (KPB) extinction hypotheses is inhibited by insufficient geochronology, exemplified in the geomagnetic polarity time scale (GPTS). The GPTS is used for age control in studies lacking means for high-precision age determination, ranging from studies on climate change to the evolution of life across the KPB. If well-calibrated, the GPTS would provide a powerful tool for probing deeper into the events around the KPB extinctions. Current calibration of the GPTS (GTS2012; Ogg, 2012) across circum KPB chrons (C30n-C28n) draws heavily on the age results of Swisher et al. (1993) for the KPB, which has been shown to be ~ 200 ka too old per reanalysis by Renne et al. (2013). Further, GPTS estimations rely heavily on astronomical tuning of ODP cores and land-based records (Zumaia) (Husson et al., 2011; Thibault et al., 2012; Kuiper et al., 2008; Westerhold et al., 2008), which fail to account for possible biasing effects of climate signals other than those due to orbital forcing, such as those associated with the KPB events. Moreover, complex sedimentation in marine sections following the mass extinction can obscure orbital signals and complicate cyclostratigraphic interpretation (Westerhold et al., 2008).\nTerrestrial deposits in the Hell Creek region of NE Montana (USA) provide an opportunity to refine the ages of polarity reversals near the KPB (C30n-C28n), and test the accuracy of orbitally tuned chronologies e.g. (Ogg, 2012). These strata are interbedded with abundant sanidine-bearing ashes, which have yielded 40Ar/39Ar ages with resolution as good as ± 11 ka and absolute accuracy in the range of ± 40 ka (Renne et al, 2013; Sprain et al., 2014). Further, these sections have relatively uniform sediment accumulation rates, which support the use of interpolation to calculate reversal ages from bounding tephra layers (Sprain et al., 2014).\nPreliminary results using new 40Ar/39Ar ages and magnetostratigraphic data suggests a duration of ~ 200 ka for the Pg. portion of C29r, roughly two 100 ka eccentricity cycles shorter than the orbitally tuned estimate of ~ 400 ka of Westerhold et al. (2008). Combining this new result with maximum estimates for the Cret. portion of C29r (Sprain et al., 2014), the duration of C29r is ~ 450 ka, significantly less than the 710 ka estimate from GTS2012 (Ogg, 2012).",

            "abstract": "The anisotropic structure of the inner core seems complex with significant depth and lateral variations. An innermost inner core has been suggested with a distinct form of anisotropy, but it has considerable uncertainties in its form, size, or even existence. All the previous inner-core anisotropy models have assumed a cylindrical anisotropy with the symmetry axis parallel (or nearly parallel) to the Earth’s spin axis. In this study, we obtain inner-core phases, PKIIKP2 and PKIKP2 (the round-trip phases between the station and its antipode that passes straight through the center of the Earth and that is reflected from the inner-core boundary, respectively), from stackings of autocorrelations of earthquake coda at seismic station clusters around the world. The differential travel times PKIIKP2 – PKIKP2, which are sensitive to inner-core structure, show fast arrivals at high latitudes. However, we also observed large variations of up to 10 s along equatorial paths. These observations can be explained by a cylindrical anisotropy in the inner inner core (IIC) (with a radius of slightly less than half the inner core radius) that has a fast axis aligned near the equator and a cylindrical anisotropy in the outer inner core (OIC) that has a fast axis along the north-south direction. The equatorial fast axis of the IIC is near the Central America and the Southeast Asia. The form of the anisotropy in the IIC is distinctly different from that in the OIC and the anisotropy amplitude in the IIC is about 70% stronger than in the OIC. The different forms of anisotropy may be explained by a two-phase system of iron in the inner core (hcp in the OIC and bcc in the IIC). These results may suggest a major shift of the tectonics of the inner core during its formation and growth.",

            "abstract": "Microbial assimilation of C-N and the physicochemical protection of soil organic matter (SOM) play fundamental roles in regulating land-atmosphere interactions. However, these microbial and physicochemical processes are not explicitly represented in current region/global terrestrial ecosystem models, e.g., the Community Land Model (CLM). The lack of explicit representation of microbial pools and functions results in unrealistic fixed-C:N ratios in SOM pools currently in CLM. Thus current soil C-N model configuration is inadequate to model the effects of litter inputs or fertilization on soil carbon and nitrogen mineralization and linkages between plant litter C:N ratios and soil or microbial C:N ratios. We propose a coupled C-N model that allows for flexible C:N ratios in microbe and SOM pools and thus the ability to represent the decomposition response to fertilization and/or litter inputs with various C:N ratios. Our preliminary analysis has shown that the C:N ratios in SOM, dissolved organic matter (DOM), and microbial pools can be well constrained by the new C-N model and microbes regulate the C:N ratios in SOM and DOM pools. We will use this new model framework to evaluate the soil carbon and nitrogen mineralization processes under conditions of excess organic C, excess organic N, or limited mineral N.",

The string-of-pearls spacecraft configuration allow the motion and dynamics of electron density to be resolved on a one minute timescale. Swarm flew northward through the Scandinavian dayside cusp, passing through auroral features and high frequency radar backscatter. The observations reveal that plasma flow channels, the transport of photoionized plasma, and cusp particle precipitation are all important processes involved in creating the structures which become polar cap patches. Newly created electron density structures are transported across the polar cap via convection. The observed time-history of density structure indicates that particle impact ionization can add structure to both photoionized plasma and lower density polar cap plasma. Newly created and highly structured plasma evolves into lower density, less structured polar cap patches as they transit the polar cap.",

            "abstract": "Gas-phase oxidation mechanisms for organic gases are often used as a starting point to understand heterogeneous oxidation. The reaction of a simple alkane hydrocarbon by OH proceeds through hydrogen abstraction and under ambient conditions leads to peroxy radical (RO2) formation. RO2 can further react to form: (1) smaller molecular weight products (i.e. fragmentation) via alkoxy radical formation and dissociation and/or (2) higher molecular weight products with oxygenated functional groups (i.e. functionalization). The ability to perturb these two pathways (functionalization vs. fragmentation) is critical for understanding the detailed reaction mechanism that control atmospheric aging chemistry of particles. At high temperatures the presence of sulfur dioxide (SO2) during organic-OH gas-phase oxidation enhances the fragmentation pathway leading to increased alkoxy formation. It is unknown if a comparative affect occurs at room temperature during a heterogeneous reaction. We used the heterogeneous reaction of OH radicals with sub-micron squalane particles in the presence and absence of SO2 as a model system to explore changes in individual mechanistic pathways. Detailed kinetic measurements were made in a flow tube reactor using a vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photoionization aerosol mass spectrometer and oxidation products are identified from samples collected on quartz filters using thermal desorption two-dimensional chromatographic separation and ionization by either VUV (10.5 eV) or electron impact (70 eV), with detection by high resolution time of flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-VUV/EI-HRTOFMS). In the presence of SO2 the yields of alcohols were enhanced compared to without SO2, suggesting that the alkoxy formation pathway was dominant. The results from this work will provide an experimentally-confirmed kinetic framework that could be used to model atmospheric aging mechanisms. ",

            "abstract": "In this work, we present a Newton-Krylov-Schwarz (NKS) based parallel implicit solver for the governing equations of Earth’s dynamo. NKS is a general purpose parallel solver for nonlinear systems and has been widely applied to solve different kinds of nonlinear problems. All previously published dynamo models treat nonlinear terms of dynamo governing equations in an explicit or semi-explicit manner, consequently, the numerical schemes are constrained by the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition. To ensure numerical stability, time step sizes should be rather small, especially for high-resolution dynamo simulations, which makes it impractical to use high-resolution dynamo models to study long term evolution of the geomagnetic field, such as reversals and superchrons. To avoid the time step size constraint imposed by CFL numbers associated with fine spacial mesh sizes, we try a fully implicit method and focus on efficiently solving the large nonlinear system at each time step on large scale parallel computers. Our algorithm begins with a discretization of the governing equations on an unstructured tetrahedron mesh with a stable finite element method in space and a fully implicit backward difference scheme in time. At each time step, an inexact Newton method is employed to solve the discretized large sparse nonlinear system while in the Newton steps, a domain decomposition preconditioned Krylov method is used to solve the Jacobian system which is constructed analytically in order to obtain the desired performance. Our numerical model is tested against known standard dynamo solutions at a moderate Ekman number. Additionally, numerical experiments show that our model has super-linear scalability with over eight thousand processors for dynamo problems with tens of millions of unknowns.",

Present-day glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) uplift rates approach 10 mm/yr or more at Hudson Bay and decrease with distance southeastward. Current GIA models forecast that the hinge line between uplift to the northwest and subsidence to the southeast lies somewhere near the Saint Lawrence valley in eastern Canada [Tushingham and Peltier, 1991; Peltier, 2002]. Employing continuous Global Positioning System (cGPS) observations and high precision tools for processing and then analyzing each component of derived time series are important tools to monitor the associated regional crustal deformation with good accuracies. Here we describe the analysis of coordinate time series of cGPS stations scattered sparsely throughout southeastern Ontario and between Ottawa and the east coast of Hudson Bay. Here, the two most reliable local networks, each including 4 to 6 reference stations, were selected for analysis. Data for period of approximately five years, 2008-2012.9, was processed with Bernese 5.0 over several campaigns. Individual cGPS coordinate time series were generated for each station and basic parameters, such as mean, variance and repeatability, were estimated. The time series are corrected with respect to the rigid plate motion and seasonal variations and advanced time series analysis techniques, including spectral analysis and principal component analysis were implemented. Post-processing of the time series reproduces the general GIA spatial pattern. Results also show that the vertical velocities of all stations in the solution are consistent with the GIA model uplift rate and are consistent with other cGPS sites in eastern Canada and increases from north of lake of Ontario (approximately 2 mm/yr) to the near Hudson (9-10 mm/yr). The horizontal velocities and directions are consistent with those of the ICE-3G GIA model, with 0.1-0.2 mm/yr uncertainties [Tiampo, Mazzotti and James, 2013]. In addition, several stations provide additional insights into crustal motion aoong the shores of the Great Lakes to the south.",

The transition zone consists of ancient eclogite layers that are displaced upwards by slabs to become broad, passive, cool ridge-feeding updrafts of ambient mantle. The physics that is overlooked in canonical models of mantle dynamics and geochemistry includes; the 2nd law of thermodynamics, convective overshoots, subadiabaticity, wave-melt interactions, Archimedes principle, and kinetics. Rapid transitions allow stress-waves to interact with melting and phase changes, creating LVZs; sluggish transitions in cold slabs keep eclogite in the transition zone where it warms up by extracting heat from mantle below 650 km, creating the appearance of slab penetration. Canonical chemical geodynamic models are the exact opposite of physics- and thermodynamic-based models and of the real Earth. A model that results from inverting the assumptions regarding initial and boundary conditions (hot origin, secular cooling, no external power sources, cooling internal boundaries, broad passive upwellings, adiabaticity and whole-mantle convection not imposed, layering and self-organization allowed) results in a thick refractory-yet-fertile surface layer, with ancient xenoliths and cratons at the top and a hot overshoot at the base. A thin mobile D” layer results, that is an unlikely plume-generation zone. Accounting for the physics that is overlooked or violated (the 2nd law of thermodynamics) in canonical models, plus modern seismology, undermines the assumptions and conclusions of these models.",

            "abstract": "Eddy-covariance (EC) observations of ecologically relevant trace gas and energy fluxes are too sparse spatially for direct assimilation into gridded earth system models (ESMs). The spatial coverage of a tower EC measurement may represent less than 1% of a grid cell resolved by ESMs. For advancing ecological inference it is hence desirable to improve the spatial representativeness of EC measurements. The objectives of this study are (i) to map the spatio-temporally variable flux field around tower EC measurements, and (ii) to quantify spatial representativeness when surrogating the flux over an ESM grid cell with EC observations that source a spatio-temporally variable patch of surface close to the tower.\nThe present study employs environmental response functions (ERFs) for this purpose. The underlying principle is to extract the relationship between biophysical drivers and ecological responses from measurements in the time-domain under varying environmental conditions. The resulting ERF can then be used for projecting the fluxes into target areas. Based on the probability density functions of resulting flux grids, the representativeness of tower measurements is quantified.\nWe apply ERF to EC measurements from July and August 2011 at the AmeriFlux Park Falls tall tower, Wisconsin, U.S.A. With the ERF procedure, the spatial coverage can be increased to >70% for target areas around the tower of 400 km2. From this we determine that 85% and 24% of the tower flux observations can capture the mean turbulent flux and its variability over a 900 km2 target area, respectively, at 5% significance and 80% representativeness level. Lastly, we determine an uncertainty budget for this methodology. Our companion presentation “Assessing and correcting spatial representativeness of tower eddy-covariance flux measurements” shows the applicability of the ERF procedure to provide consistent flux time series for target regions under different climatic and ecological environments.",

            "abstract": "Methane hydrates are crystalline, ice-like compounds under specific thermodynamic conditions. The existence of methane hydrates is confirmed in the Nankai Trough, an offshore area of Japan. Japan's Methane Hydrate Research and Development Program (MH21) has been under way at this area. In the early 2013, the world’s first intentional gas production attempt from marine gas hydrate deposits was tried and accomplished in the Daini Atumi Knoll area of the Eastern Nankai Trough.\n For gas production, depressurization method has been considered as a promising gas production technique from methane hydrate reservoirs. However, considering of continuous gas production over a long period, there is still something to clarify. The methane hydrate crystals are very small and existed in the intergranular pores of sandy layer of turbidite sediments. When the intergranular methane hydrates will be dissociated, it is considered that dissociated gas and water flow will cause sand production and mud erosion phenomena of turbidite sediments. The production of framework sands into a well is one of the problems plaguing the gas because of its adverse effects on well productivity and equipment. If the eroded mud is accumulated in the pore space of sand, skin is generated and permeability becomes lower. In addition, mud erosion has a negative effect for the well stability.\nThis research presents an experimental study to understand sand production and mud erosion phenomena for sand mud alternate layer. The aims of this study are to understand these phenomena and clarify driving forces. In our experiments, we used an artificial sedimentary core and performed experiments under various conditions. As the results, the driving forces of these phenomena are not dissociation gas flow but water flow through pore.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies on natural and experimental seismic faults have revealed that frictional heating plays an important role in earthquake dynamics as well as in producing mineralogical and microstructural signatures of seismic faulting. Here, we report changes in OSL signals in quartz by frictional heating in experimental fault gouges. The gouges (80% of quartz and 20% of bentonite by weight) with a thickness of 1 mm were sheared between sandstone cylinders (diameter: 25 mm) at a normal stress of 1 MPa and slip rate of 1.31 m/s. The quartz grains from a sand dune on the western coast of South Korea were sieved to select size fractions between 90 and 250 µm. The equivalent dose (De) of the undeformed quartz grains was 8.0 ± 0.3 Gy. Upon displacement, the friction abruptly increases to the 1st peak (with friction coefficient μ ≈ 0.75) followed by slip weakening. Then the fault zones show two more peak frictions (μ ≈ 0.53~0.75) and finally reach a steady-state friction (μ ≈ 0.2~0.35). The fault can be divided into three zones based grain size (thus slip rate); slip localization (SLZ), intermediate slip-rate (ISZ) and low slip-rate (LSZ) zones. SLZ develops adjacent to the moving side of the sandstone cylinder with P-foliation and shear band. The size of quartz (Dq) in ISZ and LSZ is 5-30 μm and 50-250 μm, respectively. SEM and TEM analyses indicate that the fault gouge of SLZ consists of subangular quartz clasts (Dq ≈ 3 μm) and matrix of nano-scale quartz, unidentified silicate minerals and amorphous material. The fault zones were sectioned into six layers (~160 µm thick for each layer) parallel to the fault zone boundary for OSL analyses. Quartz grains from all the layers except the one immediately adjacent to the stationary side of the sandstone cylinder show De of 'effectively' 0 Gy indicating a full resetting of OSL signals. The partial resetting of OSL signal in the layer adjacent to the stationary side of the cylinder indicates the temperature (T) there was not enough to empty the main OSL traps (i.e. 325 °C TL traps), which is supported by T (~250 °C) measured at the stationary side with thermocouples. Our results suggest that frictional heat during seismic events reset 'geologic clocks' of fault rocks and OSL signals in quartz from gouges in natural fault zones can be used to constrain the age of seismic events.",

            "abstract": "Significant building damage and permanent ground displacement occurred in the southern Port Hills suburbs of Christchurch during the Canterbury earthquake sequence. Damage patterns indicate that local amplification of ground motions likely contributed to the most severe effects. The Canterbury earthquake sequence provides an internationally significant case study to understand the influence of topography and local stratigraphy on ground-motion amplification in hillside areas.\nWe present site-response analyses based on GeoNet national strong motion stations, as well as four small-scale temporary seismic arrays installed in the Port Hills following the 2011 February Christchurch earthquake. These stations are spread across narrow north-south trending volcanic spurs with a variety of topographic shapes. The spurs are also overlain, in part, by thick (up to 10m) loess deposits. Site amplification, polarization and dependence on source back-azimuth are assessed using H/V and site-to-reference spectral ratio methods applied to aftershocks of the Canterbury earthquake sequence. Results are also compared with detailed 2D modelling at key locations.\nConsistent amplification peaks at hill-top locations at 1 – 3 Hz appear to be related to slope shape, with the estimated wavelength of amplification comparable to the ridge width at a given location. The strongest amplification at these frequencies generally occurs on top of narrow, steep-sided ridges. Our results imply that relatively low-velocity material comprising the eastern Port Hills has enhanced amplification in this area. At higher frequencies > 3 Hz, significant amplification is associated with local material contrasts or sharp local convex breaks in slope.\nOur results show that both local topography and material contrasts strongly influence ground motion in the Port Hills. These observations have implications for slope stability studies and engineering design in hillside areas, given that significant amplification can occur over a broad frequency range at sites generally classed as rock according to the New Zealand design standards.",

Using the SAR data, we have been putting together detailed geomorphological sketch maps of various Titan regions in an effort to piece together its geologic history. We initially examined the Afekan region of Titan due to extensive SAR coverage. Features described on Afekan fall under the categories (in order of geologic age, extrapolated from their relative emplacement) of hummocky, labyrinthic, plains, and dunes. During our mapping effort, we also divided each terrain category into several different subclasses on a local level. Our map offers a chance to present and analyze the distribution, relationship, and potential formation hypotheses of the different terrains. In bulk, we find evidence for both Aeolian and fluvial processes. A particularly important unit found in the Afekan region is the unit designated “undifferentiated plains”, or the “Blandlands” of Titan, a mid-latitude terrain unit comprising 25% of the moon’s surface. Undifferentiated plains are notable for its relative featurelessness in radar and infrared. Our interpretation is that it is a fill unit in and around Afekan crater and other hummocky/mountainous units. The plains suggest that the nature of Titan’s geomorphology seems to be tied to ongoing erosional forces and sediment deposition. Other datasets used in characterizing Titan’s various geomorphological units include information obtained from radiometry, infrared (ISS), and spectrometry (VIMS). We will present the detailed geomorphological sketch map with all the terrain units assigned and labeled.",

            "abstract": "We present the results of a series of tests that probe the possible existence of compositionally distinct material in the central core of the LLSVPs under the African and Pacific plates using tomography-based mantle flow models that employ several independently-derived viscosity profiles (Mitrovica & Forte 2004, Behn et al. 2004, Steinberger & Calderwood 2006, Forte et al. 2010). We also consider four global tomography models derived from seismic shear velocity data alone (Grand 2002, Panning & Romanowicz 2006, Kustowski et al. 2008, Ritsema et al. 2011). The possible combinations of viscosity and tomography models yield 16 different tests for compositional heterogeneity inside the LLSVPs. In all tests we begin with a mineral physical scaling between lower-mantle shear velocity and density anomalies that assumes thermal effects are dominant everywhere, including within the LLSVPs. We find it is not possible, in any of the tests, to obtain a satisfactory fit to surface geodynamic data, especially the global, long-wavelength gravity anomalies and space-geodetic inferences of excess CMB flattening with a purely thermal interpretation of lower-mantle heterogeneity. If we introduce compositionally-distinct material in the central portions of the LLSVPs, all tests show a notable improvement in the fit to the gravity anomaly and CMB ellipticity data. An optimal reconciliation of the gravity and CMB data is obtained by extending compositional heterogeneity upwards, with maximum-amplitude in the seismic D\"-layer and tapering off to negligible values in the mid-mantle. A robust assessment of the dynamical impact of this deeply-rooted compositional heterogeneity is obtained with maps of \"mean\" convective flow, by averaging the results of all 16 test cases. We find (see map below) dominant lower-mantle upwellings below the axis of the East Pacific Rise (EPR), and under the Caroline Islands in the Western Pacific. Under the African plate we find large-scale upwellings under the southern half of the East African Rift and under the Cape Verde Islands. The EPR \"plume\" has a special significance because of its association with Earth's dominant spreading ridge and plate-kinematic inferences of strong lateral fixity of this ridge over the past 83 Ma (Rowley et al. 2011).",

On average the nighttime is significantly foggier than the daytime with the peak occurrences near 9pm and 4am local time. Overall, the months of December and January contain a significantly higher number of inversion-based fog events (rather than radiation fog events) when compared to November and February, with an absolute peak in mid January. This can be attributed to a higher instance of snow on the ground, available cold air, and a lower sun angle.\nCompared with the Salt Lake Valley, the Heber Valley has a slightly higher ratio of fog events in November and especially in February. During December and January it has a slightly lower ratio of fog events. In effect, its fog season is broader and less peaked than the Salt Lake Valley. The total number of days with inversion-based fog events in the Heber Valley is significantly less than that in the Salt Lake Valley. Most fog is radiation fog. Furthermore, there is a distinct lack of fog in the evening time when compared to the morning hours. We note a strong peak around 6-9 am local time, which coincides with sunrise.\nWith the knowledge obtained from the above statistics, several typical fog cases are examined in the modeling study in order to evaluate the ability of the mesoscale community Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) in predicting fog in the Salt Lake and Heber Valleys.",

Breakout observation is the direct way to detect the far and near filed stress orientation in drilling. Here we compare those data. In 2006, ICDP performed an inland drilling project to penetrate Chelungpu fault plane in central of Taiwan, which had recently slipped in 1999 Mw 7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake. This drilling project succeeded in full coring and collecting comprehensive logging data in the borehole. The resistivity images run by Formation Micro Imager (FMI) indicated that a breakout rotation in the vicinity of the fault (1111mbf). Leak-off tests on site constrained the magnitude of minimum horizontal principal stress. Here we use these data to determine the stress variation in the fault plane in our breakout dislocation model. Based on the amount of breakout azimuth, rotation and fault geometry, the stress drop can be estimated in this model. In 2012, IODP initiated a rapid drilling project after the 2011 Mw9.0 Tohoku earthquake in Japan Trench. Due to the deep-water depth, only a real-time resistivity image recorded by Logging While Drilling (LWD) and few core samples are recovered by this expedition. However, the breakout azimuth occurred near the plate boundary (820mbsf) represents the stress disturbance after the dramatic slip comparing to TCDP case. In this research, we are attempting to discuss the possible effect factors and reconstruct the geo-mechanical models to interpret the breakout distribution observed from logging data and the stress state after these huge earthquakes.",

The AntT will help climatologists, paleoclimatologists, atmospheric chemists, geochemists, climate modelers synchronize paleoclimate archives using volcanic products that establishing timing of climate events in different geographic areas, climate-forcing mechanisms, natural threshold levels in the climate system. All these disciplines will benefit from accurate reconstructions of the temporal and spatial distribution of past rapid climate change events in continental, atmospheric, marine and polar realms. Research is funded by NSF grants: ANT-1142007 and 1142069.",

            "abstract": "Torsvik et al. [\n2006\n] suggest that the original locations of large igneous provinces (“LIPs”) and kimberlites, and current locations of melting anomalies (hot-spots) lie preferentially above the margins of two Large Lower-Mantle Shear Velocity Provinces” (LLSVPs), at the base of the mantle, and that the correlation has a high significance level (> 99.9999%). They conclude the LLSVP margins are Plume-Generation Zones, and deep-mantle plumes cause hotspots and LIPs.\nThis conclusion raises questions about what physical processes could be responsible, because, for example the LLSVPs are likely dense and not abnormally hot [Trampert et al., 2004].\nThe supposed LIP-hotspot-LLSVP correlations probably are examples of the “Hindsight Heresy” [Acton, 1959], of basing a statistical test upon the same data sample that led to the initial formulation of a hypothesis. In doing this, many competing hypotheses will have been considered and rejected, but this fact will not be taken into account in statistical assessments. Furthermore, probabilities will be computed for many subsets and combinations of the data, and the best-correlated cases will be cited, but this fact will not be taken into account either.\nTests using independent hot-spot catalogs and mantle models suggest that the actual significance levels of the correlations are two or three orders of magnitude smaller than claimed. These tests also show that hot spots correlate well with presumably shallowly rooted features such as spreading plate boundaries. Consideration of the kimberlite dataset in the context of geological setting suggests that their apparent association with the LLSVP margins results from the fact that the Kaapvaal craton, the site of most of the kimberlites considered, lies in Southern Africa. These observations raise questions about the distinction between correlation and causation and underline the necessity to take geological factors into account.\nFig: Left: Cumulative distributions of distances from hotspots to nearest ridge for 5 hotspot lists; heavy red curve: Distribution function for a random point on Earth’s surface. Hotspots are closer to ridges than expected at random. Right: For each list, the probability of at least as many random points being as close to a ridge. Values to right have higher significance.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing (HF) produces millions of gallons of waste fluid which contains a microbial community adapted to harsh conditions such as high temperatures, high salinities and the presence of heavy metals and radionuclides. Here we present evidence for microbial activity in HF production fluids. Fluids collected from a Marcellus shale HF well were supplemented with 13C-labeled carbon sources and 15N-labeled ammonium at 25°C under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Samples were analyzed for 13C and 15N incorporation at sub-micrometer scale by ion imaging with the JAMSTEC NanoSIMS to determine percent carbon and nitrogen assimilation in individual cells. Headspace CO2 and CH4 were analyzed for 13C enrichment using irm-GC/MS. At 32 days incubation carbon assimilation was observed in samples containing 1 mM 13C-labeled glucose under aerobic and anaerobic conditions with a maximum of 10.4 and 6.5% total carbon, respectively. Nitrogen assimilation of 15N ammonium observed in these samples were 0.3 and 0.8% of total nitrogen, respectively. Head space gas analysis showed 13C enrichment in CH4 in anaerobic samples incubated with 1mM 13C-labeled bicarbonate (2227 ‰) or methanol (98943 ‰). Lesser 13C enrichment of CO2 was observed in anaerobic samples containing 1 mM 13C-labeled acetate (13.7 ‰), methanol (29.9 ‰) or glucose (85.4 ‰). These results indicate metabolic activity and diversity in microbial communities present in HF flowback fluids. The assimilation of 13C-labeled glucose demonstrates the production of biomass, a critical part of cell replication. The production of 13CO2 and 13CH4 demonstrate microbial metabolism in the forms of respiration and methanogenesis, respectively. Methanogenesis additionally indicates the presence of an active archaeal community. This research shows that HF production fluid chemistry does not entirely inhibit microbial activity or growth and encourages further research regarding biogeochemical processes occurring in Marcellus shale HF wells. Biogeochemical activity may impact the efficacy of HF and natural gas production as well as the chemistry of produced fluids which have become an environmental and public health concern.",

            "abstract": "Integrated hydrologic models coupled to land surface models link water and energy movement between the subsurface, land surface and atmosphere. These connections are especially important when estimating a complex, nonlinear process like evapotranspiration (ET). In this work, a comprehensive sensitivity study of the method used to estimate ET in the ParFlow-Common Land Model (PF-CLM) is presented. Particular attention is paid to the forms of parameterizations used as well as to interactions between the groundwater and land surface models. Using this gained insight, estimates of ET from reduced forms of the parameterizations are directly compared to fully-coupled PF-CLM results. With this approach, several forms of the parameterizations are developed that vary in complexity, nonlinearity and coupling strength. The same forcing data is used to compare estimates of ET across all formulations, thus exploring the process and coupling sensitivity in a novel way. The goals of this research are to understand the sensitivity of ET estimates to parameterization complexity and establish relationships that can be used to scale ET from the tree (meter) to sub-watershed (kilometer) scale. Here we use a single column model equilibrated with atmospheric forcing from a snow-dominated alpine region (Breckenridge, Colorado, USA). Results show how subsurface pressure, ground temperature, atmospheric forcing, atmospheric stability and the fraction of wetted foliage uniquely compound to influence estimates of ET. Differences in ET magnitude are observed as the parameterization complexity changes; however, trends remain consistent throughout the year. The relationship between ET and subsurface pressure varies nonlinearly as a result of introduced resistance factors and the slope depends on ground surface temperature and parameterization complexity. Identification of sensitive interactions and driving factors are necessary to further understand hydrologic processes like ET.",

            "abstract": "Accurate understanding of beach face sediment transport in the swash zone is essential to improve existing models for predicting beach morphological changes. In the swash zone, bed shear stresses are the dominant driving mechanism of both bed-load and suspended-load sediment transport.\nA detailed comparison is presented of swash zone bed shear stresses obtained from direct measurements and velocimetry derived estimates, as measured in the large-scale GWK wave flume facility in Hannover, Germany. Bed shear stresses were measured directly by flush mounted shear plates and estimated using the logarithmic model for velocity profiles obtained from Acoustic Doppler Velocity Profilers (ADVP). The swashes measured were generated by large-scale (H > 0.9m, T > 8s) monochromatic and solitary waves on a planar fixed-bed beach with a rough surface (d50 = 4.6mm). The logarithmic model and its application to swash flows are investigated in detail for the ensemble and individual swash events.\nThe results confirm the concerns of others about log-law suitability in the swash zone and extend the prior works to fully prototype scale. The logarithmic model proves reasonably valid in uprush but increasing invalid through backwash where there is clear evidence of a systematic departure from log-law theory. The cause of the disparity is investigated and considered to be the result of unsteady hydrodynamics, free-surface pressure gradients and complex boundary layer evolution. In the latter stages of backwash the boundary layer becomes emergent further disrupting the flow, re-aerating and tending towards more complex turbulent sheet-flow behaviour. Adjustment to the depth-averaged void fraction cannot account for the magnitude of the discrepancy, indicating that the formulation of the logarithmic model itself is decreasingly valid as the flow thins and decelerates throughout backwash. Though it is conceptually appealing and relatively simple to apply, the results further confirm the limited application of the logarithmic model to sediment transport through the full uprush – backwash cycle.",

            "abstract": "One of the main issues of the geological storage of CO2 under the seabed is a risk of CO2 leakage. Once CO2seeps into the ocean, it rises in water column dissolving into seawater, which results in the acidification of seawater and/or returning to the air. Its behaviour significantly depends on flow rate and bubble size (Kano et al., 2009; Dewar et al., 2013). As for porous media, bubble size is generally predicted through simple force balance based on flow rate, surface tension and channel size which is estimated by porosity and grain size. However, in shallow marine sediments, grains could be mobilised and displaced by buoyant gas flow, which causes distinctive phenomena such as blow-out or formation of gas flow conduit. As a result, effective gas flux into seawater can be intermissive, and/or concentrated in narrow area (QICS, 2012; Kawada, 2013). Bubble size is also affected by these phenomena. To predict effective gas flux and bubble size into seawater, three-phase behaviour of gas-water-sediment grains should be revealed. In this presentation, we will report the results of gas-liquid-solid three-phase simulations and their comparisons with experimental and observation data. Size of solid particles is based on grain size composing marine sediments at some CCS project sites. Fluid-particle interactions are solved using the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), while the particle-particle interactions are treated by coupling with the Discrete Element method (DEM).\n",

            "abstract": "The focus of the majority of studies looking into the evolving tropical pacific climate on glacial/interglacial timescales has been the role of the changing orbital forcing. While this is of course the fundamental forcing that drives changes in the climate on these time scales, without a fully interactive Earth System Model the effects that the evolving ice sheets/sea level and green house gases have on the climate will be missed. In the absence of such models these other forcings must be imposed. While the impact on the temperature in both the high latitudes, and to some extent in the tropics, of all of the forcings is reasonably clear, their impact on the hydroclimate is less obvious. In this study we shall investigate what role all of the different forcings that vary over a glacial/interglacial cycle play on the hydroclimate in the eastern Tropical Pacific.\nWe use as the basis of our study a set of three climate model experiments using the model HadCM3. Each of these simulates the last 120 thousand years as a series of time slices in one of three configurations: varying the orbital forcing; varying the orbital and greenhouse gas forcing; varying the orbital, greenhouse and ice sheet/sea level forcing. With these experiments we can deconvolve the role that each forcing plays. We will show that, in addition to the orbital forcing, both the greenhouse gas forcing and the ice sheet configuration have a large impact on the eastern Tropical Pacific's hydroclimate. Using a set of more idealised model simulations we shall elucidate the mechanisms by which each of these different forcing mechanism causes the simulated changes.",

Comparisons with coarse-grained data and output from lower-resolution simulations illustrate how parameterizations can carry the same fluxes necessary for general circulation balances, but only as the mean state is distorted in order to cause the parameterizations to produce those fluxes.

            "abstract": "Diurnal cycle of rainfall is especially important as it manifests interactions between atmosphere, land, and ocean. However, biases of diurnal rainfall cycle such as too early-onset of land convection, lack of nocturnal rainfall, and lack of propagating diurnal convective organization near the topographical regions, are often found in climate models. These biases have been attributed to deficiencies of cumulus parameterization and/or insufficiencies of model resolution to represent important processes on the diurnal scale in the previous studies.\nThis study focuses on the impacts of resolution and deep cumulus schemes on diurnal rainfall cycle simulated by Community Atmosphere Model version 5.0. Processes on the diurnal scale simulated by CAM is validated with TRMM observations and ERA-Interim reanalysis. Early onset of convection and lack of nocturnal rainfall are both noticed in model simulations over tropical lands. These biases are found to be mostly attributed to the triggering function of deep cumulus scheme, not to the model resolutions, whereas finer model resolution contributes to improvements over topographical regions. Interaction of rainfall and large-scale circulation on the diurnal scale are investigated with the transpose AMIP setup during YOTC period.",

            "abstract": "NICT developed the along-track interferometry SAR (AT-InSAR) system to detect the cars and ships and measure its speed in 2011. The preliminary experiments for the running truck and ship were performed to check its function and capability of the moving targets detection. As a result, it was confirmed that the system performance was satisfactory to its specifications. In this paper, to estimate the distribution of the wave height from SAR images observed by the AT-InSAR precisely, the relationship between the wave height and the sea surface velocity measured by the AT-InSAR was clarified and a method to estimate the wave height from the measured sea surface velocity was developed. In addition, to check the capability of the ocean waves observation by the AT-InSAR, the preliminary observation for the ocean waves was performed. To estimate the wave height from the sea surface velocity, the relationship between the velocity in the sight direction and the wave height was formulated. From this formulation, it was clarified that the phase of the velocity in the sight direction is shifted to -1/2πfor the phase of the wave height. To estimate the distribution of the wave height, the wave surface velocity was estimated by subtracting the average velocity from the estimated sea surface velocity. The spectra of the wave surface velocity were calculated by 2D FFT and the spectra of the wave height were estimated from the spectra of the wave surface velocity. The distribution of the wave height was calculated from the spectra of the wave height by 2D inverse FFT.\n To check the capability of this wave height estimation method, I observed the sea surface by the AT-InSAR. The observation area is the sea surface at 3 km off the coast of Ooarai, north-east to Tokyo, JAPAN. The analysis area is about 2 km square. The incident angle at the center of the SAR image was 55 degrees. The sea state condition was a calm during the observation. The observation was performed in 2 directions and the accuracy of the estimation results were checked. The significant wave height and period measured by the AT-InSAR agreed with it measured by the wave gage located close to this observation area. In addition, there were no irregular wave heights in the distribution of the estimated wave height. As a result, it was confirmed that the AT-InSAR could observe the wave height in a calm sea.",

            "abstract": "Aluminum oxide (Al2O3) is an important ceramic material and a major oxide in the earth. Additionally, alumina is a widely used pressure standard in static high-pressure experiments (Cr3+-bearing corundum, ruby). The changes of its crystal structure with pressure (P) and temperature (T) are important for its applications and understanding its physical properties in the deep Earth. There have been numerous reports on the high P-T polymorphs of alumina. Previous theoretical calculations and experiments suggest that the crystal structure of Al2O3 evolves greatly at high P-T. In this study, we used the newly developed multigrain crystallography method combined with single-crystal x-ray diffraction analysis technique for the structure determination of alumina at high P-T to provide single-crystal structure refinement for high-pressure phases of Al2O3. Alumina powder was mixed with ~10% Pt and Ne was used as both pressure transmitting media and thermal insulating layers during laser-heating. Coarse-grained aggregates of Al2O3 were synthesized in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell. The structure change of Al2O3 was monitored by in situ x-ray diffraction at ~1 Mbar and 2700 K. The results allow us to distinguish the structural differences between the Rh2O3 (II) structure (space group Pbcn) and perovskite structure (space group Pbnm) for the first high-pressure phase of Al2O3. More detailed results will be discussed in the later work.",

Utilizing stereo 360-degree imagery from panoramic camera of Yutu rover, the system enables the operator to visualize the terrain and the celestial background from the rover’s point of view in 3D. To avoid image distortion, stereo 360-degree panorama stitched by 112 images is projected onto inside surface of sphere according to panorama orientation coordinates and camera parameters to build the virtual scene. Stars can be seen from the Moon at any time. So we render the sun, planets and stars according to time and rover’s location based on Hipparcos catalogue as the background on the sphere. Immersing in the stereo virtual environment created by this imaged-based rendering technique, the operator can zoom, pan to interact with the virtual Moon scene and mark interesting objects. Hardware of the immersive virtual Moon system is made up of four high lumen projectors and a huge curve screen which is 31 meters long and 5.5 meters high. This system which take all panoramic camera data available and use it to create an immersive environment, enable operator to interact with the environment and mark interesting objects contributed heavily to establishment of science mission goals in Chang'E-3 mission. After Chang'E-3 mission, the lab with this system will be open to public. Besides this application, Moon terrain stereo animations based on Chang'E-1 and Chang'E-2 data will be showed to public on the huge screen in the lab. Based on the data of lunar exploration，we will made more immersive virtual moon scenes and animations to help the public understand more about the Moon in the future.",

            "abstract": "In coastal aquifers a wedge of intruded seawater extends inland from the coastline and is separated from the freshwater part of the aquifer by a sloping transition zone. Few studies have provided a detailed characterisation of the chemical composition and the age of groundwater within the wedge. This paper presents the results of a field study from South Australia in which a series of multi-level observation wells were installed in a semi-confined aquifer along a transect that extends 1 km inland from the coast. An unexpected finding was that, apart from intruded seawater, a second saltwater type was present in the form of hypersaline groundwater residing in the bottom part of the aquifer. Using the conservative tracers chloride and the stable isotopes of water, a three-end member mixing model was developed. Age tracers, in particular 14C, revealed that the hypersaline end member is older than the intruded seawater by at least tens of thousands of years. It is postulated that the hypersaline water formed as a result of strong evaporation during a time with dryer climatic conditions than the present, and that the seawater intruded over the hypersaline body when sea level rose during the Holocene. The results of this study testify that the hydrological evolution of coastal areas often lead to much more complex salinity distributions than those based on the classical conception of a coastal aquifer in a steady equilibrium with the present sea level and coastline position.",

From a 6-year period of ground observations, from 2008 to 2013, we selected 150 events at longitudinally separated stations (ATH and MGD, group 1), 782 at latitudinally separated stations (MGD and MOS, group 2), all with high coherence of Pc1 waveforms (r > 0.5). As a result, we found that the peak occurrence rates of simultaneous Pc1 events were at 12-18 UT in group1, when ATH was in the morning sector and MGD in the midnight sector. In group 2, the peak was at 18-21 UT, with MGD and MOS in the morning sector. Using cross-correlation analysis, we confirmed the similarity of Pc1 pearl structures at different stations during Pc1 event timing. 82 % of Pc1 events in group 1 were less than 40 % of similarity of Pc1 pearl structures. In addition, 18 % of Pc1 events in group 1, which are over than 40 % of similarity of Pc1 pearl structures, were concentrated at 10-18 UT. According to polarization angle distribution in group 1, 57 % of Pc1 events occurred between ATH and MGD. Most of those events had high similarity of Pc1 amplitude envelopes. We investigated the relationship between the similarity of Pc1 pearl structures and geomagnetic activities (AE and SYM-H indices). The AE index seemed suddenly to start decreasing before the Pc1 onset and increasing after 80 min. The variation of SYM-H index was increasing 2 hours before Pc1 onset. From our statistical analysis, we suggest that the beating process in the ionosphere could be the dominant generation mechanism of Pc1 pearl structures in the ionosphere. It seems that the ionospheric duct in dawn sector of the ionosphere is well-defined during Pc1 pulsation propagating from ionospheric sources to stations. In order to understand the beating process in the ionosphere more clearly, we are going to take into account the possible effects such as distributed ionospheric source, attenuation effect in the ionosphere, dispersive propagation in the ionosphere and Pc1 source amplitude. Using the same procedure, we will also investigate Pc1 pearl structures simultaneously observed at latitudinally separated ground stations (MGD and MOS).",

An uncored hole that penetrated to 850.5 meters below seafloor (mbsf) (total depth [TD] = 7740 meters below sea level [mbsl]) was documented using logging while drilling (LWD) tools. From an adjacent partially cored hole drilled to 844.5 mbsf (TD = 7734 mbsl) 21 cores were acquired that spanned the two main fault targets. The operations lasted 88 days.\n The drilling operation was very technically challenging. The drill string had to be withdrawn a number of times due to high seas, and technical issues; five holes were drilled (one abandoned after spud-in) and reoccupied in >6800 m water depth. A simple observatory was deployed in the wellhead installed during Exp 343 during the follow-up Exp 343T.\n In certain intervals during coring we mostly recovered loose, subrounded fine gravel clasts of the two major lithologies penetrated to those depths (silt and mudstones). We have performed particle shape and size analysis on these gravel aggregates. Particle shape variations apparent visually are not clearly quantified by conventional ‘shape descriptors’. Variations in particle size distributions are apparent and we will discuss whether these relate to variations in drilling parameters.",

            "abstract": "The source of the intriguing surface chemistry of the icy moon, Europa has been widely debated. Of primary interest is the process of surface-ice-shell-ocean exchange of trace chemistry. Of particular astrobiological interest is the possible endogenic origin of the surface chemistry. The viscous lid atop the ice-shell poses a physical barrier for such a material exchange to occur. We have performed a computational study of thermochemical convection models to test the weakening of this viscous lid by warmer plumes of lower compositional density rising in the ice-shell. We modeled a two-phase convecting ice-ocean system with a low viscosity proxy fluid approximation for the liquid ocean. On achieving a stable convecting system, the newly frozen ice at the base of the warm ice plumes at the shell-ocean boundary is tracked and mapped as it is advected upwards by the rising plumes. The newly formed ice is prescribed a lower intrinsic density than the ambient ice to mimic the scenario where compositional contrasts in the ice-shell could exist. We then study how the rising compositional plumes incorporated with the low intrinsic density new ice can erode the stagnant lid at the top of the ice-shell. Several values of density contrast have been modeled to study any variability in their extent of erosion of the lid.\nThe models show that in a convecting ice-ocean system, it is possible for less dense newly formed ice to incorporate into the convecting ice plumes and erode the lid over time. The results suggest that if oceanic trace chemistry were to be incorporated into the newly frozen ice at the ice-ocean interface, it could be possible for it to reach the surface by continual erosion of the viscous ice lid at the top of the shell. This presents a plausible scenario for surface detection of an endogenic chemical signature that could be a potential biosignature of subsurface life in Europa.",

            "abstract": "Current global warming and human activities may exert profound effects on lacustrine environment and ecosystem. However, limited data have been reported to show how lake systems have responded to changes in climate and human disturbances. Here we report multi-proxy climate and environmental data for the past ~150 years from two small alpine lakes with similar size and hydrology at the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, a place influenced by the Indian summer monsoon. One is Jiren Lake (4500 m asl), above the modern tree line and undisturbed by any human activity in history. Another is Cuoqia Lake (3900 m asl), just below the tree line and only experienced an deforestation and reforestation process by human activity over the past centuries. We use hydrogen isotopes of C28-fatty acid and TOC as proxies for changes in monsoon precipitation and lake productivity, respectively. Our data indicate both lakes have experienced similar variations in monsoon precipitation over the past 150 years, resembling the temperature variations in the northern Hemisphere. On the other hand, both lakes show very different changes in lake productivity. Productivity at Jiren Lake was stable before 1920AD and then shifted to an increasing trend, which coincides with our precipitation record and reveals the lake ecosystem being largely controlled by natural climate change. At Cuoqia Lake, the lake productivity gradually decreased until ~1980AD and then increased until now, largely following the local deforestation and reforestation process. Overall, our preliminary data probably indicate that human activities may have a stronger influence than natural climate change on lacustrine ecosystems.",

Located at geostationary orbit, GOCI can provide hourly images, total 8 times in daytime covering East Asia over 2500 km × 2500 km centered at 130°E and 36°N with 500 m spatial resolution.  Using 8 channels in visible and near-infrared from 412 to 865 nm of GOCI both in high temporal and spatial resolution, the GOCI aerosol property retrieval algorithm has been developed and updated. Latest GOCI aerosol products consist of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and fine-mode fraction (FMF) at 550nm, single scattering albedo (SSA) at 440nm, Angstrom exponent (AE) between 440-870nm, and aerosol type according to FMF and SSA.\nIn this study, we evaluated the accuracy of GOCI aerosol products using ground-based AERONET Level 2.0 products from total 14 East Asia sites and satellite-based MODIS-Aqua aerosol C6 products. The period of assessment is 3 years from March 2011 to February 2014. Comparison results show that a correlation coefficient between the AODs at 550 nm of AERONET and GOCI  is 0.922, and RMSE is 0.179 over total sites with regression equation of AOD (GOCI) = 0.959 * AOD (AERONET) - 0.027. Difference of GOCI AOD and the AERONET is analyzed according to scattering angle, surface reflectance, and season. Validation of AE shows high correlation in spring season. It also shows good agreement with MODIS-Aqua aerosol products. Preliminary results show that the correlation coefficient and RMSE between GOCI and MODIS DT AOD are 0.826 and 0.196, respectively. With MODIS DB AOD, these values are 0.776 and 0.335, respectively. The trend of 3-year GOCI AOD over East Asia shows decreasing except for Korea peninsula. During Feb, 2014, highest AOD was detected from GOCI and AERONET over the Korea peninsula.",

            "abstract": "Snow hydrology, climate, and forest ecosystems are intricately connected, with snow serving as a key moisture source for forests while forests fundamentally affect snow accumulation and ablation. These connections have important implications for western US water resources and forest management. Forests reduce snow accumulation via canopy interception while ablation is affected via changes in energy balance. We contrast the snow hydrology of undisturbed forests in the Oregon Cascades with those affected by wildfire and forest harvest. When the forest canopy is removed by wildfire or forest harvest it increases total snow accumulation and increases snowmelt rates. After a high-severity wildfire, canopy removal increases light transmission to the snow. The charred standing trees shed burned debris onto the snowpack surface decreasing snow albedo. The net result for the snowpack is much higher absorbed shortwave radiation and earlier/faster melt. Our work shows that the albedo effect can persist for several years after the fire. Forest harvest also reduces the forest canopy but unlike the post-wildfire environment, forest litter decreases. Our measurements and modeling results show that the effects of forest harvest on snow vary with elevation. At our lower-elevation warmer sites, snow persists longer in the open areas than in the forest while at the higher elevation colder sites, snow persists longer in the forest. In addition to our snow hydrology results, we present preliminary hydrologic modeling showing how these differences in snow accumulation and melt rates influence streamflow in watersheds dominated by surface runoff and in those dominated by groundwater flow.",

            "abstract": "The Asia Monsoon is among Earth’s most intriguing and spectacular phenomena. The Indian Monsoon System (IMS) is a regional manifestation this continental-scale phenomenon with complex characteristics and predictive challenges. India exhibits one of the largest rates of population growth that relies on IMS cycle for water supply. Thus, understanding the temporal variability of the IMS is essential to realistically predict the impacts of climate change on Asia’s water resources and food security. Here we investigate intraseasonal-to-interannual variability of the IMS in the climate of the 20th century using the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) and examine future scenarios of climate change using the high spatial resolution models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) project. IMS is characterized with a large-scale index continuous in time and obtained by performing combined EOF analysis (CEOF) of variables that characterize the monsoon cycle: precipitation, low level circulation at 10 m, specific humidity and temperature at 2m. CFSR is used to derive the index (1979-2013). Projections of the CEOF onto the tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) indicate that the first CEOF captures the large-scale features of the South and East Asia Monsoon. The second CEOF is associated with the IMS and its time coefficient is used as large-scale index for the IMS (LIMS). LIMS realistically defines IMS onset and withdrawal, and its amplitude associates with total seasonal precipitation. Moreover, the spectral analysis of the ISMI shows peaks on intraseasonal timescales that are related to IMS’s active and break phases. Moreover, we demonstrate that LIMS identifies the interannual variability of IMS and can be used to investigate floods and droughts that have occurred over India. Similar approach is used to investigate the skill of the CMIP5 models in realistically simulating active and break phases of the IMS in the ‘historic’ run (1951-2005). We select the models that best represent the intraseasonal variability of IMS and examine projected changes in the amplitude and persistence of the break and active periods in the high-emission representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) (2006-2100). This research has been supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF- 1116105).",

            "abstract": "Subglacial environments are cold, dark, and possess a range of redox conditions. These environments are gaining attention in global biogeochemical cycles as to their role in releasing bioavailable micronutrients such as Fe and the production of greenhouse gases. However, there is uncertainty about how the microbial communities interact with lithology and mediate geochemical reactions under glacial conditions.\nWe examined the microbial communities and their influence on elemental cycling in two glacial environments along the western Greenland Ice Sheet margin: Thule in the north (76ºN, 68ºW) and Kangerlussuaq in the south (67ºN, 51ºW). The north is dominated by supraglacial melting with considerable contribution from the periglacial environment; the south has a well-developed subglacial drainage system. The lithology is sedimentary rocks in the north and crystalline rocks in the south and this difference was reflected in the geochemistry of the drainages. Runoff in the north was oxygen saturated throughout the season. A change from Na and Cl dominance in spring to Ca and SO4 and overall increase in solute concentration marked a stronger contribution from active layer thawing. In the south, waters were undersaturated in oxygen at times, presumably due to biological and chemical sinks of subglacial origin. The meltwater here was dominated by HCO3, SO4 and Ca. In subglacial outflows Fe (oxyhydr)oxide concentrations increased with decreasing oxygen concentration suggesting their formation under oxygen limiting conditions. The high abundance of sulfate implies oxidation of iron sulfides which is consistent with inverse modeling of subglacial weathering processes under anoxic conditions. Meltwater in both locations transported reactive particulate iron which in the north consisted mainly of Fe oxides while Fe(oxyhydr)oxides dominated in the south. DNA and RNA signatures indicate microbial phylotypes that are active in iron reduction, sulfidic mineral weathering, sulfur oxidation, and sulfide reduction supporting the assumption that FeS2 oxidation and formation of particulate reactive Fe(oxyhydr)oxide is microbial mediated. Our data suggest the presence of active microbially iron and sulfur cycling in ice-covered and ice-free zones near the margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet.",

            "abstract": "The velocity structure in the lithosphere is quite complex and is rarely homogeneous. Wave reflection, transmission, and diffraction from the boundaries of the different layers and inclusions are expected to lead to a rich dynamic response and significantly affect rupture propagation on embedded faults. Here, we report our work on modeling dynamic rupture in an elastic domain with an embedded soft (stiff) layer as a first step towards modeling rupture propagation in realistic velocity structures.\nWe use the Finite Element method (Pylith) to simulate rupture on a 2D in-plane fault embedded in an elastic full space. The simulated domain is 30 km wide and 100km long. Absorbing boundary conditions are used around the edges of the domain to simulate an infinite extension in all directions. The fault operates under linear slip-weakening friction law. We initiate the rupture by artificially overstressing a localized region near the left edge of the fault. We consider embedded soft/stiff layers with 20% to 60% reduction/increase of wave velocity respectively. The embedded layers are placed at different distances from the fault surface.\nWe observed that the existence of a soft layer significantly shortens the transition length to supershear propagation through the Burridge-Andrews mechanism. The higher the material contrast, the shorter the transition length to supershear propagation becomes. We also observe that supershear rupture could be generated at pretress values that are lower than what is theoretically predicted for a homogeneous medium. We find that the distance from the lower boundary of the soft layer to the fault surface has a stronger influence on the supershear transition length as opposed to the thickness of the soft layer.\nIn the existence of an embedded stiffer layer we found that rupture could propagate faster than the fault zone P-wave speed. In this case, the propagating rupture generate two Mach cones; one is associated with the shear wave, and the other is associated with the local P-wave speed. This is a signature of supersonic crack tips. We also noted a smooth transition into supershear, with the rupture speed increasing continuously through the so-called ‘energetically forbidden zone’ (between Rayleigh wave speed and shear wave speed) corresponding to the wave speeds of the background medium.",

            "abstract": "A magnetic susceptibility meter with several-decade frequency band has recently made it possible to obtain superparamagnetic grain-size distributions only by room-temperature measurement. A rigorous deconvolution scheme of frequency dependence of susceptibility is already available. I have made some corrections on the deconvolution scheme and present its applications to broadband susceptibility data on loess and volcanic rocks.\nDeconvolution of frequency dependence of susceptibility was originally developed by Shchervakov and Fabian [2005]. Suppose an ensemble of grains distributed for two independent variables of volume (grain-size) and energy barrier. Applying alternating magnetic field with varying frequency results in differentiating grains by energy barrier - not directly by volume. Since the response function for frequency is known, deconvolution of frequency dependence of susceptibility provide a rigorous solution for the second moment of volume on the volume-energy barrier distribution. Based on a common assumption of a linear relation between volume and energy barrier, we can obtain analytical volume or grain-size distributions of superparamagnetic grains.\nA ZH broadband susceptibility meter comprises of two separated devices for lower (SM-100, 65 - 16kHz) and higher (SM-105, 16k - 512kHz) frequency ranges. At every frequency susceptibility calibration was conducted using three kinds of paramagnetic rare earth oxides [Fukuma and Torii, 2011].\nAlmost all samples exhibited seemingly linear dependences of in-phase susceptibility on logarithmic frequency. This indicates that the measured data do not suffer serious noise, and that the second moment of volume is relatively constant against energy barrier. Nonetheless, third-order polynomial fittings revealed slight deflections from the quasi-linear susceptibility - logarithmic frequency relations. Deconvolving the polynomials showed that such slight defections come from peaks or troughs in varying second moment of volume against energy barrier. Assuming a linear relation between volume and energy barrier, peaks or troughs around 1 x 10^{-24} m^{3} were found for the derived volume distributions. Long-tailed volume distributions from Chinese loess samples suggest the broad grain-size distribution.",

            "abstract": "Ice shelf basal melt rates represent an important, yet challenging measurement for understanding ice-ocean interactions and climate change. In November 2011, two moorings containing fiber-optic cables for distributed temperature sensing (DTS) were installed through the McMurdo Ice Shelf at Windless Bight, Antarctica, penetrating ~200m of ice and extending ~600m into the ice shelf cavity. Annual basal melt rates in the region are estimated to be close to the 1m resolution of the DTS system. However, the smooth thermal profile of ice shelves and high spatial resolution of DTS allows for transient monitoring of the thermal gradient close to the ice-ocean interface. By utilizing the thermal gradient near the interface we are able to resolve the interface location more precisely and at a higher spatial resolution than the field deployed DTS system. The thermal gradient near the ice-ocean interface is extrapolated to the in situ freezing temperature in order to continuously track the interface and to estimate seasonal melt rates. Maximum melting corresponds with the arrival of seasonal warm surface water in the ice shelf cavity and is estimated to be 8.5mm∙d-1, approximately ten times greater than the observed winter melt rate. The development of a continuous, surface-based, measurement technique for ice shelf basal melting represents a significant advance in our ability to monitor ice shelf stability and ice-ocean interactions.",

This study reconstructs variations in SST for the last 2 million years by using the alkenone unsaturation index of marine sediments recovered from Site U1425. There have been many studies on the palaeoceanography of the northwestern Pacific marginal seas covering the last glacial maximum and/or the penultimate glacial maximum periods. Until recently, however, little information was available on longer time scale proxy records of the northwestern Pacific margin. Establishing palaeoceanographic records from the northwestern Pacific margin is necessary for understanding the large scale ocean and climate changes and/or their linkages. This study presents a long term alkenone temperature record of Site U1425 spanning the last two million years. The reconstructed alkenone temperatures clearly illustrate the variability being consistent with orbital-scale global climate records over the period. Especially the alkenone SSTs fluctuate greatly and they are comparable to world-wide benthic foraminiferal isotope stack record. We will present more details regarding the characteristics of 2 million year SSTs in the presentation. Site U1429 was drilled by IODP Expedition 346 in the northern part of the Okinawa Trough in the East China Sea. Here we will also present extremely high-resolution alkenone temperature changes of Site U1429 over the last 400,000 years. Comparison of these records with other proxy records from high- to low-latitudes will give us a unique chance to understand the linkage between latitudinal climate patterns and dynamics.",

Despite the importance of the interactions between subsurface soil moisture and vegetation dynamics on the climate system both in global and regional scales, a land data assimilation approach that can effectively address these water and vegetation growth interactions has yet to be established. We develop a new land data assimilation system that can improve to simultaneously simulate surface and subsurface soil moisture and vegetation growth by assimilating a microwave observation that is sensitive to both surface soil moisture and terrestrial biomass. Our new system, Coupled Land and Vegetation Data Assimilation System (CLVDAS) comprises an eco-hydrological model that has a physically-based and sophisticated soil hydrology scheme and dynamic vegetation model that can estimate vegetation growth and senescence, and radiative transfer model that can convert land surface conditions into brightness temperatures in the microwave region. The CLVDAS firstly optimizes hydrological and ecological unknown parameters in the model at the same time by using the shuffled complex evolution method. Secondly, the model states of surface soil moisture, root-zone soil moisture, and leaf area index are adjusted by using genetic particle filter. We can justify to adjust the root-zone soil moisture from a microwave observation of the earth surface since we explicitly model subsurface water – vegetation dynamics interactions. From the point-scale evaluation at the in-situ observation sites in Mali, Mongolia, the United States, and Australia, we confirm the CLVDAS significantly improve the skill of simulating vertical soil moisture distribution and vegetation dynamics by assimilating microwave brightness temperatures from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and its successor (AMSR2).",

            "abstract": "Connectivity is defined as the probability that particles leaving a source patch (spawning site) arrive at a sink patch (settling ground) for a given advection time. It can measure stochastic processes of a wide range of larval dispersal due to chaotic coastal circulations (e.g., Mitarai et al., 2009). The present study aims at investigating larval networks in Seto Inland Sea (SIS), an about 450-km long, semi-enclosed, estuarine tidal channel connected to Kuroshio drifting off the two openings of SIS. We quantify coastal connectivity using Lagrangian PDFs of enormous amount of Lagrangian particles released in the modeled SIS circulation field in a double nested configuration based on ROMS at the horizontal grid spacing of 600 m (Uchiyama et al., 2012). The particles are released twice a day from 140 source patches with a radius of 5 km for 2 months in the winter 2011, and integrated over the advection time of 30 days, mimicking spawning and pelagic larvae of marbled sole.\nThe Lagrangian PDFs and the associated connectivity patterns are found to be generally heterogeneous. The connectivity matrices successively depict the larval networks in SIS. We separate SIS into 8 subregions (i.e., bays) to determine the networks among them. The fraction of the particles that exit to another region is about less than 40% except for the two entrance subregions, suggesting the intra-subregional transport is predominant. However, the particles are gradually transported eastward due to the residual mean clockwise circulation of SIS. We then evaluate the larval dispersal of marbled sole in a subregion, Harima Nada (HN). Destination strength shows that particles released in HN are mainly transported towards the northern shore of Shodo Island, and source strength indicates that the particles arriving there originate primarily from the western shore of HN. Those results suggest a potential utility of the ocean model-derived connectivity to quantify the larval networks in estuaries.",

            "abstract": "13C-18O bond abundance in carbonates is becoming more widely used as a geothermometer; this proxy is affected by various environmental factors. Here we report the influence of cations (Mg2+, Ca2+, Na+, and K+) at high concentrations (~2 mol/liter) on the isotopologue composition of the DIC pool. Clumped isotope fractionation in CO32– groups of dissolved species and carbonate minerals is reported using the notation Δ63 corresponding mainly to the enrichment in per mil of Hx13C18O16O2x–2 (plus Hx12C18O17O 16Ox–2, Hx12C17O17O 17Ox–2, and Hx13C17O17O 16Ox–2) above the amount expected for a random distribution of isotopes among all CO32–, HCO3– and H2CO3 isotopologues. The Δ63 of a solution of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) depends upon the relative abundances of each DIC species (CO2(aq) or H2CO3, HCO3-, and CO32-) since each DIC species has a distinct equilibrium clumped isotope signature. These abundances depend primarily upon solution pH and secondarily upon temperature and salinity (fresh water vs. sea water vs. brine).\nSolvated DIC species with additional ions and the composite DIC solutions were modeled as a series of supermolecular clusters, each with a single DIC molecule, an added cation, and 21 to 32 surrounding H2O molecules. As in our previous work (Hill et al., 2014, GCA 125, 610–652), we developed electronic structure models at different levels of theory to ensure the best possible reliability at reasonable computational efficiency. Overall, the models predict that common aqueous cations will slightly increase the 13C-18O clumping signature of both individual DIC species and the total DIC pool at a given pH, salinity, and temperature. Predicted Δ63values are also dependent upon cation concentration.\nThe perturbing effect of Mg2+ > Ca2+ > K+ > Na+. Dissolved cations increase the clumped crossover pH (pH at which the composite Δ63 of the DIC pool equals the Δ63 of calcite at equilibrium). Our models predict that a DIC solution of low to moderate pH (i.e. dominantly HCO3– or H2CO3) will have Δ63 greater than the equilibrium Δ63 of calcite; at higher pH (i.e., mostly the CO32- species in solution) the composite DIC Δ63 will be lower than the equilibrium Δ63 of calcite. As salinity and/or temperature increase, the crossover pH (between higher or lower Δ63) decreases.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the extent and effect of observational uncertainty remains a key concern in hydrologic model specification. Advances have been made in developing robust Bayesian approaches for characterizing the impact of uncertain climatological drivers on hydrologic predictions and parameters. However, these approaches are typically very high dimensional, requiring specification of large numbers of variables that represent statistical uncertainty in the model inputs. Recent developments in approximate Bayesian methods offer an elegant alternative to the fully Bayesian approach. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is commonly used in situations where a model is easy to simulate from, but where the likelihood is difficult or impossible to calculate. The ABC approach provides an opportunity to develop novel hydrologic statistics for model inference and to develop efficient methods for parameter identification in high dimensional hydrologic models. In this study, we demonstrate the use of approximate Bayesian methods for characterizing uncertain model inputs across multiple hydrologic case studies. Model inference is conducted via statistics that capture hydroclimatic and hydrologic functioning. Our analysis investigates the utility of ABC for model assessment, parameter identification and uncertainty characterization when dealing with potentially large observational uncertainties in hydroclimatic applications.",

            "abstract": "Mean column-integrated optical properties from ground sun photometers of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) are studied to provide an overview of the characteristics of aerosols over the region as part of the 7 Southeast Asian Studies (7-SEAS) mission. The 15 AERONET sites with the most available level 2 data products are selected from Thailand (Chiang Mai, Mukdahan, Songkhla and Silpakorn University), Malaysia (University Sains Malaysia), Laos (Vientiane), Vietnam (Bac Giang, Bac Lieu and Nha Trang), Taiwan (National Cheng Kung University and Central Weather Bureau Taipei), Singapore, Indonesia (Bandung) and the Philippines (Manila Observatory and Notre Dame of Marbel University). For all 15 sites, high angstrom exponent values (α>1) have been observed. Chiang Mai and USM have the highest mean Angstrom exponent indicating the dominance of fine particles that can be ascribed to biomass burning and urbanization. Sites with the lowest Angstrom exponent values include Bac Lieu (α=1.047) and Manila Observatory (α=1.021). From the average lognormal size distribution curves, Songkhla and NDMU show the smallest annual variation in the fine mode region, indicating the observed fine aerosols are local to the sites. The rest of the sites show high variation which could be due to large scale forcings (e.g., monsoons and biomass burnings) that affect aerosol properties in these sites. Both high and low single scattering albedo at 440 nm (ω0440) values are found in sites located in major urban areas. Silpakorn University, Manila Observatory and Vientiane have all mean ω0440 < 0.90. Singapore and CWB Taipei have ω0440 > 0.94. The discrepancy in ω0 suggests different types of major emission sources present in urban areas. The absorptivity of urban aerosols can vary depending on the strength of traffic emissions, types of fuel combusted and automobile engines used, and the effect of biomass burning aerosols during the dry season. High aerosol optical depth values (τa550 > 0.4) are mainly found over inland sites north of Songkhla and south of China on mainland Asia. Major pollution types in the region include biomass burning smoke and urban aerosols. The highest average τa550 is measured in Bac Giang, which has been studied to be greatly affected by aerosol sources from Eastern China during the later parts of the year.",

            "abstract": "A shift in the distribution of socially-relevant climate variables such as daily minimum winter temperatures and daily precipitation extremes, has been attributed to anthropogenic climate change for various mid-latitude regions. However, while there are many process-based arguments suggesting also a change in the shape of these distributions, attribution studies demonstrating this have not currently been undertaken. Here we use a very large initial condition ensemble of ~40,000 members simulating the European winter 2013/2014 using the distributed computing infrastructure under the weather@home project. Two separate scenarios are used:1. current climate conditions, and 2. a counterfactual scenario of “world that might have been” without anthropogenic forcing. Specifically focusing on extreme events, we assess how the estimated parameters of the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution vary depending on variable-type, sampling frequency (daily, monthly, …) and geographical region. We find that the location parameter changes for most variables but, depending on the region and variables, we also find significant changes in scale and shape parameters. The very large ensemble allows, furthermore, to assess whether such findings in the fitted GEV distributions are consistent with an empirical analysis of the model data, and whether the most extreme data still follow a known underlying distribution that in a small sample size might otherwise be thought of as an out-lier.\nThe ~40,000 member ensemble is simulated using 12 different SST patterns (1 ‘observed’, and 11 best guesses of SSTs with no anthropogenic warming). The range in SSTs, along with the corresponding changings in the NAO and high-latitude blocking inform on the dynamics governing some of these extreme events. While strong tele-connection patterns are not found in this particular experiment, the high number of simulated extreme events allows for a more thorough analysis of the dynamics than has been performed before.\nTherefore, combining extreme value theory with very large ensemble simulations allows us to understand the dynamics of changes in extreme events which is not possible just using the former but also shows in which cases statistics combined with smaller ensembles give as valid results as very large initial conditions.",

            "abstract": "Millennial to orbital-scale rainfall changes in the Mediterranean region and corresponding variations in vegetation patterns were the result of large-scale atmospheric reorganizations. In spite of recent efforts to reconstruct this variability using a range of proxy archives, the underlying physical mechanisms remained elusive.\nHere we present results from a new high-resolution sedimentary section from Lake Van (Turkey, ICDP Paleovan) along with two simulations of an Earth system model (LOVECLIM). We identified a pervasive link between periods of enhanced North Atlantic glacial iceberg calving, weaker Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, Dansgaard-Oeschger cold conditions and massive droughts in the Eastern Mediterranean for the past three glacial cycles. On orbital-timescales, our paleorecord/model data suggests that the topographic effect of large Northern Hemisphere ice sheets and periods with minimum boreal insolation seasonality further exacerbated drought intensities by suppressing both summer and winter precipitation.\nFurthermore, we reconciled the seemingly contradictive regional orbital-scale lake-level variations of Lake Van in Turkey and Lake Lisan in the Dead Sea Basin (DSB) by conducting a thought experiment- an idealized lake-level model over the past 80 kyr for Lake Van and Lake Lisan was forced with the simulated regional precipitation and evaporation data of the orbital-scale LOVECLIM experiment. It shows that reduced glacial precipitation can lead to either higher or, lower lake levels, depending on the delicately balanced relative changes in temperature-driven evaporation. Therefore, decreasing simulated and reconstructed glacial precipitation in the Eastern Mediterranean region is not inconsistent with the high glacial lake stands in DSB lakes.",

            "abstract": "Parameterization of iceberg calving for prognostic glacier and ice sheet models remains a major challenge due to a poor understanding of the physical processes governing calving. Here, I propose a semi-empirical, macroscopic parameterization of calving that ignores the complex physics of the glacier-ocean interface, can be applied to any calving margin, and is easy to implement with very little computational cost. To test the parameterization, I apply it to a one-dimensional flowline model of an Alaskan-style tidewater glacier and subject the model to various climatic forcings. The model produces results that are roughly consistent with observations, i.e., rapid retreat and flow acceleration through an overdeepening over decades and slow re-advance over millenia. Model results are compared to the previously proposed water depth, height above flotation, and crevasse-depth calving parameterizations to show that they are consistent with the macroscopic parameterization under certain conditions. Although there remains a great deal of uncertainty in the exact form of the macroscopic parameterization, it does appear to be a promising and simple way to model the glacier-ocean boundary.",

            "abstract": "Recent Arctic changes suggest alterations in the export of freshwater from the Arctic to the North Atlantic, with conceivable impacts on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning circulation. Approximately 50% of the Arctic outflow exits west of Greenland, traveling through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) and into Baffin Bay before crossing Davis Strait. The CAA outflow contributes over 50% of the net southward freshwater outflow through Davis Strait. The remainder is deeper outflow from Baffin Bay, flow from the West Greenland Current and runoff from West Greenland and CAA glaciers.\nSince September 2004, an observational program in Davis Strait has quantified volume and freshwater transport variability. The year-round program includes velocity, temperature and salinity measurements from 15 moorings spanning the full width (330 km) of the strait accompanied by autonomous Seagliders surveys (average profile separation = 4 km) and autumn ship-based hydrographic sections. Over the shallow Baffin Island and West Greenland shelves, moored instrumentation provides temperature and salinity measurements near the ice-ocean interface. From 2004-2013, the average net volume and liquid freshwater transports are -1.6 ± 0.2 Sv, -94 ± 7 mSv, respectively (salinity referenced to 34.8 and negative indicates southward transport); sea ice contributes an additional -10 ± 1 mSv. Over this period, volume and liquid freshwater transports show significant interannual variability and no clear trends, but a comparison with reanalyzed 1987-90 data indicate a roughly 40% decrease in net southward liquid volume transport and a corresponding an almost 30% decrease in freshwater transport. Connections between the Arctic are also captured, e.g., a unique yearlong Davis Strait freshening event starting September 2009 that was likely driven by an earlier freshening (January 2009 – April/May 2010) in the Canadian Arctic. The Davis Strait autumn 2009 salinity minimum was fresher (by about 0.2), lasted longer, and spanned a greater distance across the strait than in other years.",

SAPS is a manifestation of the Magnetosphere-Ionosphere (M-I) coupling. Therefore, it is important to know occurrence characteristics of SAPS in order to understand the details of M-I coupling system. As a result of the present analysis of SAPS using the SuperDARN Hokkaido HF radar, Kataoka et al. [2009] reported that positions of SAPS shifts toward lower latitude with decreasing Dst index. We investigate the characteristics of SAPS, with focus on the relationship between occurrence characteristics of SAPS and a variety of solar wind and geomagnetic parameters, using the SuperDARN Hokkaido HF radar with a field of view covering Far East Russia, which has been in operation since 2006. In particular, we identify the lowest limit of SAPS speed, which has not been discussed in the previous literatures. This is to examine the lowest threshold of electric field to generate SAPS as a result of M-I coupling. In order to investigate SAPS occurrence characteristics comprehensively, we analyzed events with wider ranges of velocity and MLAT than those in the previous studies. As a result of statistical analysis, we found two categories of westward flows that were reasonably separated with a speed threshold of ~150-200 m/s. For the faster flows above the threshold there is a clear correlation between MLAT and Dst index, whereas for the slower flows there is no such correlation. Similar correlation is found for MLT and AL index as well.

            "abstract": "Subglacial Lake Whillans (SLW) is a shallow subglacial water reservoir covered by 800m of ice. A custom-built hot-water drill was used to access SLW in a microbiologically clean way in late January 2013. Lake access for sampling and in-situ measurements was maintained for a total of 3 days. We deployed an array of scientific tools through a large diameter borehole: a downhole camera, a conductivity–temperature–depth (CTD) probe, a Niskin water sampler, an in situ filtration unit, three different sediment corers, a geothermal probe and a geophysical sensor string. We confirm the existence of a subglacial water body whose presence was inferred from satellite altimetry and surface geophysics. Subglacial water is about two orders of magnitude less saline than sea water (0.37–0.41 psu vs 35 psu) and two orders of magnitude more saline than pure drill meltwater (<0.002 psu). It reaches a minimum temperature of –0.55 degrees C, consistent with depression of the freezing point by pressure from ca. 800m of ice. Subglacial remained turbid throughout the observation period. The recovered sediment cores contained a macroscopically structureless diamicton with shear strength between 2 and 6 kPa. Our recommendation for future subglacial access through water-filled boreholes in cold ice is to supply heat to the top of the borehole to keep it from freezing. Development of a centimeters-thick ice layer on top of the borehole water column prevented deployment of some light borehole tools.",

            "abstract": "Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are often accompanied by coronal dimming evident in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray observations. The locations of dimming are sometimes considered to map foot-points of the erupting flux rope. As emitting material expands in the corona, the decreased plasma density leads to reduced emission observed in spectral and irradiance measurements. Therefore, signatures of dimming may be used to diagnose initiation of CMEs. We analyze three events of flare, CME, and coronal dimming. Data from the Solar Dynamics Observatorys Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and EUV variability Experiment (EVE) are used for observations of the dimming, and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatorys EUVI, COR1 and COR2 are used to obtain velocity for the associated CMEs. We also calculate the magnetic reconnection rate from the Helioseismic and Magnetic (HMI) combined with AIA 1600. The magnetic reconnection fluxes are correlated well with CME height profiles while the reconnection rate peaks at the CME acceleration maximum. In two events, the dimming light curve also shows good correlation with the CME height evolution. We model the dimming evolution based on several different assumptions of CME expansion: isothermal or adiabatic, self-similar or one-dimensional. The observed dimming light curves agree with the calculations based on one dimensional, isothermal CME expansion model. Dimming in the third event cannot be described by the above CME expansion models, and we speculate that the nature of dimming associated with the third CME event is different from the other two.",

For reasonable middle atmosphere simulations, the model uses parameterizations of orograhpic and nonorographic gravity wave drag (GWD). The orographic GWD parameterization is based on the McFarlane scheme, and the nonorographic GWD parameterization is based on the ultra-simple spectral parameterization (USSP) scheme. In order to obtain results in good agreement with observations, some tunable parameters included in the GWD parameterizations are adjusted in the range of physically reasonable values.\nIn this study, the impacts of GWD parameterizations on the middle atmosphere are investigated and their performances are evaluated against observations and reanalysis data. For this, a pair of simulations is performed: one initialized by ECMWF Interim Reanalysis data for 1 June 2008, the other one for 1 December 2008, respectively. The results during two weeks after a one month spin-up period are analyzed. In these simulations, model captures a cold summer polar mesopause and a warm winter polar stratopause reasonably, which means that model produce a realistic meridional circulation. The horizontal and vertical structure of zonal-mean zonal wind is also realistically simulated although summer easterlies and winter polar night jet are a little stronger and poleward and equatorward vertical inclinations of the easterly and westerly jets are underestimated compared with the observations. Recently, we also implemented source-based parameterizations schemes of nonorograhpic GWD (convective and frontal GWD) into the latest version of the KIAPS-GM for more physically based parameterizations of GWD. The impacts of the source-based GWD schemes are compared with those of the USSP scheme and their performances are also evaluated against the observations and reanalysis data. The detailed results will be shown at the conference.",

            "abstract": "There are several potentially very large sources of Arctic amplifying feedbacks that have been identified. They present a great risk to the future as they could become self and inter-reinforcing with uncontrollable knock-on, or cascading risks. This has been called a domino effect risk by Carlos Duarte. Because of already committed global warming and the millennial duration of global warming, these are highly policy relevant. These Arctic feedback processes are now all operant with emissions of carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide detected. The extent of the risks from these feedback sources are not obvious or easy to understand by policy makers and the public. They are recorded in the IPCC AR5 as potential tipping points, as is the irreversibility of permafrost thaw. Some of them are not accounted for in the IPCC AR5 global warming projections because of quantitative uncertainty. UNEP issued a 2012 report (Policy Implications of Thawing Permafrost) advising that by omitting carbon feedback emissions from permafrost, carbon budget calculations by err on the low side. There is the other unassessed issue of a global warming safety limit for preventing uncontrollable increasing Arctic feedback emissions. Along with our paper, we provide illustrations of the Arctic feedback sources and processes from satellite imagery and flow charts that allows for their qualitative consideration. We rely on the IPCC assessments, the 2012 paper Possible role of wetlands permafrost can methane hydrates in the methane cycle under future climate change; a review, by Fiona M. O’Connor et al., and build on the WWF 2009 Arctic Climate Feedbacks: Global Implications. The potential sources of Arctic feedback processes identified include: Arctic and Far North snow albedo decline, Arctic summer sea ice albedo decline, Greenland summer ice surface melting albedo loss, albedo decline by replacement of Arctic tundra with forest, tundra fires, Boreal forest fires, Boreal forest die-back, warming subarctic peat rich wetlands (methane), thawing permafrost (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide), and Arctic subsea floor methane.",

            "abstract": "Suspended sediment (SS) can have significant impacts on ecological system, and high SS concentration can have significant impacts on human life. In the previous studies, radionuclide analysis has been applied to evaluate the production of SS in the river basins, which demonstrated that the surface soil erosion can be estimated by using radionuclide Pb-210ex. However, radionuclide analysis cannot indicate the relative amounts of SS transported from each individual sub-basin to the downstream end. Thus, X-ray Fluorescence Analysis (XRF Analysis) can be considered as an alternative method to radionuclide analysis because the XRF Analysis can measure 21 chemical compositions, Na2O, MgO, Al2O3, SiO2, P2O5, SO3, Cl, K2O, CaO, TiO2, Cr2O3, MnO, Fe2O3, Co2O3, NiO, CuO, ZnO, Rb2O, SrO, BaO, and Y2O3 by using X-ray Fluorescence Analyzer.\nIn June of 2007, high turbidity, which is more than 10,000 (NTU), was measured in the Oromushi River basin of Hokkaido in Japan. Therefore, this study aims to clarify the mechanism of the transport of SS in the Oromushi River basin. We measured chemical compositions of soil with diameter less than 63 μm in the Oromushi River basin in order to pay attention to SS by using XRF. The Principal Component Analysis revealed that SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, CaO and Na2O are the dominant chemical compositions. Although the predominant composition was the same in a river basin including the downstream end, significant differences were found in the pattern of chemical compositions. Therefore, by using the chemical compositions of SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, CaO and Na2O, the Mixing Stable Isotope Analysis in R model (MixSIAR) based on Bayesian statistics was applied to estimate the transportation rate of SS from each sub-basin to the downstream end, which agreed with the field experiment results very well. As a result, spatial patterns of SS transportation rate are found to be strongly related to surface soil type.",

            "abstract": "Limited knowledge exists concerning the role of the low-latitude marginal seas in mercury (Hg) emissions on a global scale, especially tropical-subtropical and monsoon-dominated marginal seas in East Asia. To assess this potential mobilization of Hg through air-sea gas exchange, we have determined the dissolved elemental Hg (DEM) and gaseous elemental Hg (GEM) concentrations in surface seawater and atmosphere, respectively, during seasonal oceanographic cruises to the SouthEast Asian Time-series Study (SEATS) station (18 oN, 116 oE) from 2003 to 2007. The sampling and analysis of GEM and DEM were performed on board ship by using an on-line mercury analyzer (GEMA). Over the SCS, the GEM concentrations are elevated 2-3 times above global background values, with higher enhancements in the winter when the northeast monsoon draws air from China. The impact of long-range transport, as controlled by seasonal monsoons, has on the Hg atmospheric distribution and cycling in the SCS. The DEM concentration varied seasonally, with a high in summer and a low in winter and showed a positive correlation with sea surface temperature (SST). The elevated DEM concentration in summer appears mainly abiologically driven. In winter, the SCS acts as a sink of atmosphere Hg0 as a result of low SST and high wind of the year, enhanced vertical mixing and elevated atmospheric gaseous elemental mercury. Annually, the SCS serves as a source of Hg0 to the atmosphere of 300±50 pmol m-2 d-1 (390±60 kmol Hg y-1, ~2.6% of global emission in ~1% of global ocean area), suggesting high regional Hg pollution impacts from the surrounding Mainland (mostly China).",

            "abstract": "The polar mesosphere and thermosphere provide a unique natural laboratory for studying the complex physical, chemical, neutral dynamical and electrodynamics processes in the Earth’s atmosphere and space environment. McMurdo (geographic 77.83S, geomagnetic 80S) is located by the poleward edge of the aurora oval; so energetic particles may penetrate into the lower thermosphere and mesosphere along nearly vertical geomagnetic field lines. Lidar observations at McMurdo from December 2010 to 2014 have discovered several neutral atmosphere phenomena closely related to ionosphereic parameters and geomagnetic activity. For example, the diurnal tidal amplitude of temperatures not only increases super-exponentially from 100 to 110 km but also its growth rate becomes larger at larger Kp index. The lidar discovery of neutral iron (Fe) layers with gravity wave signatures in the thermosphere enabled the direct measurements of neutral temperatures from 30 to 170 km, revealing the neutral-ion coupling and aurora-enhanced Joule heating. A lidar 'marathon' of 174-hour continuous observations showed dramatic changes of composition (Fe atoms and ice particles) densities (over 40 times) in the mesopause region and their correlations to solar events. In this paper we will study the plasma-neutral coupling on the dark side of Antarctica via observation analysis and numerical modeling of the thermospheric Fe layers in the 100-200 km. A newly developed thermospheric Fe/Fe+ model is used to quantify how Fe+ ions are transported from their main deposition region to the E-F region and then neutralized to form Fe layers under dark polar conditions. We will also study the plasma-neutral coupling on the bright side of Antarctica via analyzing Fe events in summer. Complementary observations will be combined to show how the extreme changes of Fe layers are related to aurora particle precipitation and visible/sub-visible ice particles. These observations and studies will open new areas of scientific inquiry regarding the composition, chemistry, neutral dynamics, thermodynamics, and electrodynamics of one of the least-understood regions in the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "The physical and chemical characteristics of the grains in sedimentary deposits can provide valuable clues about transport processes, distance traveled, and provenance. A fundamental physical characteristic is particle shape, which is diagnostic of transport process as well as the distance traveled. For example, it is possible to distinguish the emplacement process of sediments based entirely on the shape of the quartz grains in the deposit [e.g., Folk, 1980]. Such basic sedimentological concepts have been applied to our interpretation of surface materials on the terrestrial planets [e.g. Cabrol et al., 2014]. However, what we know about the nature of sedimentary materials is based primarily on sediments that have weathered from felsic rocks—granite. This is true because felsic materials compose most of the landmass on the Earth. Yet, the surface of Mars is composed predominately of mafic materials—basalt—and sedimentary particles derived from basalt are much different than those derived from granite. Instead of quartz, feldspar, and heavy minerals commonly found in most terrestrial sedimentary deposits, basaltic sediments are typically composed of varying amounts of olivine, pyroxene, plagioclase, and vitric and lithic fragments. Both the persistence of basaltic particles and their specific gravities are different than particles derived from granite. These differences are important because they will affect the characteristics of basaltic sediment as it is transported by wind, water, and ice, and currently we have little to no understanding as to how basaltic sediment will weather as a function of the transport mechanism and distance.\nWe will present preliminary analyses of typical basaltic sediments that have been transported by a variety of geologic processes in Hawaii, including details about surface texture, componentry, and the influence different sedimentary processes may have on remote sensing data. The figure below shows examples of A) sediment transported by fluvial processes, B) sediment collected from the surface of a large climbing dune, and C) sediment collected from an end moraine located at the summit of Mauna Kea. The scale bar at the bottom is 500m.",

            "abstract": "A number of studies have found mixed hydrologic trends in North America, e.g., increasing stream flow in the Mississippi river basin and decreasing stream flow in the Pacific Northwest. This study aims to bring out an important detail about the asymmetry in hydrologic response by applying the Budyko framework which characterizes watersheds as energy or water limited using a ratio of climatological mean evaporative power to precipitation. We studied long-term hydrologic changes in 46 large unimpaired watersheds (drainage area > 1000 km2) in the western United States and equivalent watersheds in western Canada. Daily stream flow observations from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Water Survey of Canada, and PRISM based high resolution (4-km) monthly temperature and precipitation data are employed. We studied long-term trends (1965 to 2010) in 18 hydroclimatic indicators that include annual and seasonal stream flow, precipitation, temperature, and timing of center-of-volume. The trends’ statistical significance is assessed using Mann-Kendall test with long-term persistence consideration.\nWe found the highest signal in winter (Jan.-Feb.-Mar.) minimum temperature where 48% of all watersheds in western United States show significant increasing trends. Among hydrologic indicators, we found highest signal in summer stream flow (normalized by annual precipitation) where 17% of all watersheds show significant decreasing trends. Further, we group these watersheds in two groups using the Budyko framework: (1) energy limited (15 watersheds), e.g. Pacific Northwest, and (2) water limited (31 watersheds), e.g. southwestern United States. We found 33% of energy limited watersheds and 10% of water limited watersheds show a significant decreasing trend in summer water availability. Averaged across all watersheds in the respective energy and water limited regions, we found a significant decreasing trend in the energy limited regions and no trend in water limited regions. A theoretical basis or a hypothesis for the asymmetry in hydrologic response is proposed. We plan to test the hypothesis using downscaled climate model data and hydrologic modeling approaches. We are also updating the analysis to include unimpaired stream flow stations from western Canada and more stations from the western United States.",

            "abstract": "The gigantic Dabashan orocline, situated in the south Qinling Orogen, is a response of the tectonic uplift to the collision between the North China Craton and the Yangtze Craton in Mesozoic. However, how the orocline formed and deformed is still not well understood mainly due to inaccessible deep crust structures. In this study, we aim to address this question by investigating the detailed crust structures.\nWe process continuous ambient noise data collected from ~170 stations of Chinese provincial networks operating during 2007 and 2009 to extract interstation surface wave dispersion curves. Using these dispersion curves, we generate Rayleigh wave phase velocity maps at 6-60 sec periods. By inverting the resulting Rayleigh wave dispersion maps using a Bayesian Monte Carlo method, we construct a 3D isotropic Vsv model with a lateral resolution of 50-60 km. The 3D Vsv model reveals detailed crust velocity structures which help to decipher the formation mechanism of the Dabashan orocline.\nProminent low velocities are observed beneath the Dabashan orocline at 10-15 km depth, which may represent the buried passive continental margin sedimentations of the Yangtze Craton. High velocities are observed on the two sides of the orocline beneath the Shengnongjia-Huangling and Hannan Domes extending from the surface with Archean-aged outcrops to the mid/lower crust. The deep-rooted high-velocity domes very likely reflect the presence of the relative rigid Archean basement which acts as obstacles during the intra-continental shortening; while detachments may develop in the weak passive continental margin of sedimentations beneath the Dabashan during the shortening process, assisting the southward thrusting of nappes from the south Qinling Orogen onto the northern margin of the Yangtze Craton, which finally forms the gigantic Dabashan orocline. This model is also consistent with the thermo-chronological constraints and stratigraphic records which together indicate the initiation of the uplifts in the two domes are possibly earlier than in Dabashan.",

            "abstract": "Microbial oxidation of hydrocarbon released from marine sediments at ocean margin triggers deposite of authigenic carbonates. These carbonates excellently archive ancient seepage activies. Here, we report petrographic, mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of a carbonate deposit discovered in the Cretaceous deep-sea fan section in Tibet, providing diagnostic information on hydrocarbon seepage origin. The carbonates occur as clustered, isolated, chimney-like and stratoid concretions, enclosed in the Cenomanian turbidite siltstone. These concretions consist of carbonate (63.2% on average), clastic quartz and feldspar (23.2% on average), and clay minerals (13.5% on average). They exhibit negative δ13C values ranging from -34.1‰ to -12.9‰, indicating a carbon origin from seeping thermogenic methane. A relatively deep origin of thermogenic methane is also supported by the lower 87Sr/86Sr ratios (from 0.706221 to 0.706808). The carbonates have low δ18O values varying from -13.1‰ to -2.2‰, most of which indicate diagenetic alteration. The negative linearity between oxygen and carbon isotopic values suggests a diagenetic fluid with relatively high δ13C values and high temperature. The shale-normalized REE patterns show varied Ce anomalies. Most samples with no real Ce anomaly illustrate reducing environments. The stratoid concretions and an isolated concretion just above the clustered concretions have real negative Ce anomalies suggesting changeable redox conditions and several sudden changes of flux rate possibly resulted from suspended-reactive cycles of seep activities. Several cycles within short time are likely related with the paroxysmal activities of turbidite sedimentation, which would result in fast loading and finally promote hydrocarbon seeps. There are indications of more widely occurring seep deposits in Cretaceous strata located in Tibet, raising the question if all these hydrocarbon seeps are promoted by regional structure activities.\nAknowlegements: This work was supported by the NSFC (41273041).",

            "abstract": "Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) is an instrument that measures the temperature and wind velocity of the thermosphere by observing from the ground the 630-nm airglow emission. The Solar-Terrestrial Environment Laboratory (STEL), Nagoya University, has five FPI observatories that represent the Optical Mesosphere Thermosphere Imagers. Two of these FPIs using a large aperture etalon (diameter: 116mm) were installed at Shigaraki (FP00), Japan in 2000 and in Tromsø (FP01), Norway, in 2009. The other three smaller FPIs, using 70-mm diameter etalons, were installed in Thailand (FP02), Indonesia (FP03), and Australia (FP04) in 2010-2011. These FPI instruments all use highly-sensitive cooled-CCD cameras (1024x1024 pixels) to observe the interference fringes. However, the error values of temperature estimates were much larger than expected, i.e., 200 K, and the temperature value found in the preliminary analysis was not within the expected range of 600 to 1200 K. In the present study we improved the procedure of temperature determination using these small-etalon FPIs and carried out a statistical analysis of the temperature data obtained by FP01-04 for 3-5 years after 2009. The FPIs scan the sky in north, south, east, west, zenith directions repeatedly by rotating two 45-degree mirrors. We determined the centers of the HeNe 632.8 nm laser and sky fringes for each direction. When we found that these ring centers may vary slightly by a few pixels from one direction to the next, we realized that this difference of fringe centers was a result of the distortion of the optical mounting frame, which is caused by the motion of the heavy scanning mirror on top of the FPI optics. When we determine the fringe center for each direction, then the error values of temperature estimation improved from 200 K to about 30 K, and the results became more in line with the range of expected results. We estimated airglow intensity from the data and performed statistical analysis of the data obtained by FP01-04 for 3-5 years after 2009. Then we found that the low temperatures are obtained when the airglow intensity is very small. In this presentation, we show results derived from the evaluation of the reliability of the obtained temperatures with consideration regarding the accuracy of FPIs and the relation between airglow intensity and obtained temperatures.",

            "abstract": "We describe a method for making single-satellite estimates of the seasonal variability in global-average eddy diffusion coefficients. Eddy diffusion values as a function of time between January 2004 and January 2008 were estimated from residuals of neutral density measurements made by the CHallenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) and simulations made using the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Electrodynamics - Global Circulation Model (TIME-GCM). The eddy diffusion coefficient results are quantitatively consistent with previous estimates based on satellite drag observations and are qualitatively consistent with other measurement methods such as sodium lidar observations and eddy-diffusivity models. The eddy diffusion coefficient values estimated between January 2004 and January 2008 were then used to generate new TIME-GCM results. Based on these results, the RMS difference between the TIME-GCM model and density data from a variety of satellites is reduced by an average of 5%. This result, indicates that global thermospheric density modeling can be improved by using data from a single satellite like CHAMP. This approach also demonstrates how eddy diffusion could be estimated in near real-time from satellite observations and used to drive a global circulation model like TIME-GCM. Although the use of global values improves modeled neutral densities, there are some limitations of this method, which are discussed, including that the latitude-dependence of the seasonal neutral-density signal is not completely captured by a global variation of eddy diffusion coefficients. This demonstrates the need for a latitude-dependent specification of eddy diffusion consistent with diffusion observations made by other techniques.",

            "abstract": "On 26－27 December 2006, a series of submarine cables were damaged offshore southwestern Taiwan from Gaoping Slope to the northern terminus of the Manila Trench. The cable breakages were caused by gravity flows which triggered by the Pingtung earthquake doublet occurred on 26 December 2006 at 20:26 (21.9°N, 120.6°E; ML 7.0) and 20:34 (21.97°N, 120.42°E; ML 7.0) offshore of Fangliao Twonship and meanwhile the local fishermen reported disturbed waters at the head of Fangliao submarine canyon. Although many researchers conjectured the disturbed waters may cause by the eruption of submarine volcanoes which has been widely discovered off the southwestern Taiwan, the actual mechanism is still unclear. In previous studies, a series of faults, liquefaction strata, pockmarks and acoustically transparent sediments with doming structures were observed at the head of Fanliao submarine canyon and may highly related to the submarine groundwater discharge off southwestern Taiwan. Recently, further multi-beam surveys were conducted at the east of Fangliao submarine canyon head and the result shows large area of seafloor subsidence after Pingtung Earthquake. The area of subsidence is over 60 km2 with maximum depth around 5 meters. The north end of the subsidence is connected to the Fangliao submarine canyon where the first cable was failed (CH-US CN-W2-1: 22°13.287’N, 120°33.722’E) after Pingtung Earthquake. All the evidences point out the large earthquake might triggered liquefaction process and generated large debris flow and swept the submarine cables away from the Fangliao submarine canyon head to the abyss.",

            "abstract": "In fluvial systems, biofilms are the main driver of biogeochemical transformations. Biofilms grow on most surfaces in the benthic and hyporheic regions, where they process waterborne solutes. These solutes are transported in the regional flow and their fluxes near the biofilms are controlled by local physical properties, such as head gradients and hydraulic conductivity. These properties are in turn influenced by the growth of the biofilm itself, which can clog porous media and/or develop its own network of porous space. Therefore, the residence time of a solute in proximity to biofilm surfaces, where it can be processed, should be influenced by the properties not only of the physical environment, but by that of the biofilm itself. We hypothesized that the presence of biofilms would increase residence times in the benthic and shallow subsurface regions of the stream bed. We performed controlled experiments in 4 experimental streams at Notre Dame's Linked Experimental Ecosystem Facility (ND-LEEF) to quantify the interaction between substrate and biofilm in controlling anomalous solute transport. Each stream at ND-LEEF had a different substrate configuration: 2 with homogeneous substrate but with different sizes (pea gravel vs. coarse gravel) and 2 with heterogeneous substrate (alternating sections vs. well-mixed reaches). We measured the evolution of the residence time distributions in the streams by injecting rhodamine tracer (RWT) multiple times over the course of a 5 month colonization gradient. Analysis of breakthrough curves demonstrated that in addition to the influence of substrate, biofilm colonization and growth significantly influenced the residence time in the system. Specifically, as biofilms grew, the power-law exponent of the RTD decreased, i.e. the tails of the distributions became heavier, suggesting prolonged retention due to the presence of the biofilms. Although the substrate signature persisted over time, with the coarser gravel bed washing out faster than the smaller gravel bed, all streams had a similar pattern of the power law exponent decreasing exponentially over time. These results demonstrate benthic control of anomalous solute transport through the dynamic relationship and feedback between the physical and biological environments.",

            "abstract": "Global earthquake activity provides an opportunity to actively engage students and teachers in the Earth Sciences. With earthquakes often hitting the news headlines the Australian Seismometers in Schools (AuSIS) program utilizes the resulting public awareness and curiosity, providing tools and support for teachers and students to find out more. Most teachers are unaware of the wealth of resources available and often lack confidence to teach earth science, as they have little to no formal training. With the introduction of earth science to the national curriculum it has become imperative teachers receive this support. AuSIS connects students and teachers with earthquake data relevant to them that is both real-time and easily accessible. The biggest challenge faced is often how to engage with remote and rural communities over the vast Australian continent. Our approach has been to take information to the teachers, providing workshops at national science teacher conferences and developing guides that provide step-by-step instructions for classroom activities. These professional development workshops include hands-on demonstrations as well as online discovery. The data recorded at schools on our network of seismometers is publicly accessible and is shared with scientists, amateur seismologists and students alike, this provides students with a sense of involvement in the scientific community. We link teachers with additional online resources and utilize social media to alert them to interesting earth science facts and earthquake activity. For continued exploration we provide easy access to our data and earthquake information through a mobile app and website. Our website combines both local and global earthquake catalogs to provide a one-stop shop of earthquake information of interest to the teachers and students. We also encourage online interactions with teachers through a forum on our website and through social media aimed to provide continued support.",

Resilience thinking is an approach to stewardship of social-ecological systems that seeks to bring the (often) fragmented diverse efforts and practices under an integrated framework. The notion of resilience is rapidly gaining ground in the sustainability literature. As a concept with broad scope and increasing popularity, resilience can be utilized to frame various problems related to different climate- and non-climate-induced disruptions in urban areas. Acknowledging that resilience thinking can provide a platform for communication between different parties operating in diverse research areas related to cities, this presentation describes the meaning of resilience in human communities. It emphasizes the essential role of social capital in mobilizing residents for collective action and facilitating collaboration between various groups and organizations that exist in an urban setting. It is argues that diffusion and implementation of such a collective and bottom-up approach to address the consequences of global environmental change warrants a governance shift from the conventional “persuasive communication processes” to “emergent dialogue” mechanisms that acknowledge the existence of complexities and uncertainties and advocate adopting a participatory process to create desired future communities that are capable of coping with the adverse consequences of global environmental change.",

Because of their complexity, these problems frequently require approximations to make them both analytically and computationally tractable. Dynamical models with stochasticity and multiple time scales can be studied using stochastic averaging methods to accurately approximate the slow time scale variables of the system in the weak (statistical) sense and to reduce the dimension of the problem. Most stochastic averaging studies have focused on the case where the stochastic forcing terms are Gaussian (due to the Central Limit Theorem). However, several atmospheric dynamics studies indicate that heavy-tailed noise is more appropriate for modelling purposes in some cases. In these situations, established stochastic averaging methods cannot be used.\nWe present stochastic averaging approximations that can be used in situations where the stochastic forcing is heavy-tailed, specifically alpha-stable, rather than Gaussian, emphasizing the key ideas in the derivation of the approximations, numerical results, and potential applications to climate research.",

            "abstract": "The late Paleozoic Ice Age (LPIA) is the longest-lived icehouse of the Phanerozoic and the only time a metazoan dominated and vegetated world transitioned from an icehouse climate into a greenhouse. Despite several decades of research, the timing, extent of glaciation and the location of ice centers remain unresolved, which prohibits reconstruction of ice volume. The Permo-Carboniferous sediments in the Tepuel-Genoa Basin, Patagonia contains a near complete record of sedimentation from the lower Carboniferous through lower Permian. Outsized clasts, thin pebble-rich diamictites and slumps represent the last of the late Paleozoic glacially influenced deep-water marine sediments in the Mojón de Hierro Fm. and the Paleozoic of Patagonia. U-Pb analysis of detrital zircons separated from slope sediments reveal groupings (20 myr bins, n≥5 zircons) with peak depositional ages of 420, 540 to 660 and 1040 Ma. Zircon age populations recovered from the Mojón de Hierro Fm. compare well with bedrock ages of the Deseado Massif of SE Patagonia, suggesting this may be a potential source of sediments. The maximum depositional age of the sediments is 306.05 ± 3.7 Ma (2σ) as determined by the median age of the two youngest concordant zircons that overlap in error. The youngest zircon from the analysis yields a 238U/206Pb age of 301.3 ± 4.5 Ma (2σ; MSWD = 2.3). Younger zircons from the analysis compare well with the age of granite bedrock exposed along the basin margin to the E-NE suggesting they may reflect a more proximal source. These data, which indicate a maximum age of late Carboniferous for the Mojón de Hierro Fm, provide the first geochemical constraints for the timing of final deposition of glaciomarine sediments in the Tepuel-Genoa Basin, and contributes to the biostratigraphic correlation of the late Paleozoic succession in Patagonia with other key LPIA basins that has thus far been hindered by faunal provincialism.",

Although the spatial distributions of EMIC waves have been investigated by several spacecraft such as CRRES, THEMIS and AMPTE/CCE, there have been little studies on plasmaspheric EMIC waves. We investigate statistically EMIC wave data using the Akebono/VLF measurements. The plasmaspheric EMIC waves tend to be distributed at lower L-shell region (L~2) than the slot region. There are no significant MLT dependences, which are different from the EMIC waves outside the plasmapause. The plasmaspheric EMIC wave frequencies depend on the equatorial cyclotron frequency, suggesting that the plasmaspheric EMIC waves are not propagated from high L-shell but generated near the equivalent L-shell magnetic equator. This result is consistent with the result of the dependence of resonance energy. Using the in-situ thermal plasma density measured by the Akebono satellite, we estimate the resonance energy of energetic ions, and the resonance energies of the plasmaspheric EMIC waves are few tens keV to ~ 1 MeV. The results indicate that the ring current and radiation belt ions may contribute the generation of the plasmaspheric EMIC waves.",

            "abstract": "Eastern Australia is covered by a series of continental sedimentary basins deposited during the Triassic and Jurassic, but the geodynamic context of these basins is not fully understood. Using gridded aeromagnetic data, seismic reflection data, geological maps, digital elevation models, and field observations, we conducted a structural synthesis aimed at characterizing major structures and deformation style in the Triassic-Jurassic sedimentary basins of eastern Australia. Our results show evidence for four alternating episodes of rifting and contractional events during the Triassic. Two major episodes of rifting, characterized by syn-sedimentary steep normal faults and bimodal volcanism, resulted in the development of the Early-Middle Triassic Esk-Nymboida Rift System and the early Late Triassic Ipswich Basin. Faults in the Esk-Nymboida Rift System have been controlled by a pre-existing oroclinal structure. Each phase of rifting was followed by a contractional event, which produced folds, reverse faults and unconformities in the basins. Since the latest Late Triassic, thermal subsidence led to the deposition of continental sediments in the Clarence-Moreton Basin, which continued until the Early Cretaceous. We suggest that the geodynamic control on the alternating episodes of rifting and contraction during the Triassic in eastern Australia was ultimately related to plate boundary migration and switches between trench retreat and advance.",

            "abstract": "Interest in liquid and interfacial behavior within nano-confinements spans many disciplines. Geophysical interest originates from a desire to understand flow mechanisms through hydrocarbon-rich nano-porous shale media, especially communication between fractures and the adjacent nano-porous matrix (imbibition). This work investigates the extent of boundary layer nucleation during polar liquid flows in hydrophilic nano-confinements via discrepancies seen in viscosity and capillary pressure from their bulk values. We perform our experiments in two-dimensional nanochannels of varying size and as small as 30 nm x 60 nm in cross section and still obtain visual data with reflected differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. The simple geometry of the nanochannels enables the comparison against analytical transport solutions. By designing a nanochannel experiment that allows us to monitor the rate of fluid imbibition and volume loss of a trapped air pocket the liquid is imbibing into, we are able to decouple capillary pressure and viscosity from imbibition data, as well as gain information about gas partitioning at the meniscus interface. Our current experiments are performed with organic solvents within siliceous nanochannels and the results of the decoupling scheme indicate that for rectangular nanochannels with heights of 60 nm and varying widths, effective viscosity is consistently between 4-12 times higher than the bulk value and capillary pressure is around 50% less than the macroscopic Young-Laplace equation prediction. These results equate to the nucleation of wall boundary layers on the order of tens of molecular layers thick. Structured boundary layers have an inherently increased viscosity compared to the liquid bulk value, resulting in a significant reduction in imbibition efficacy. This presence of approximately 15 nm boundary layers in on the threshold of two different theories – thin bimolecular boundary layers and exclusion zones (thick boundary layers) – and beckons deeper inspection into how surface chemistry and hydrodynamic shearing control the extent of boundary layer termination during liquid flow in hydrophilic two-dimensional nano-confinements and pores.",

            "abstract": "Landscape evolution models (LEM) commonly utilize stream power laws to simulate river incision with formulations such as E = KAmSn, where E is a vertical incision rate [L/T], K is an erodibility constant [L1-2m/T], A is an upstream drainage area [L2], S is a local channel gradient [-], and m and n are positive exponents that describe the basin hydrology. In our reduced complexity model, the landscape approached equilibrium by balancing an incision rate with a constant, uniform, vertical rock uplift rate at every location in the landscape. From our simulations, for a combination of m and n, the landscape exhibited scale invariance. That is, regardless of the size and scale of the basin, the relief and vertical structure of the landscape remained constant. Therefore, the relief and elevation profile of the landscape at equilibrium were only dependent on the coefficients for erodibility and uplift and an equation that described how upstream area, A, increased as the length of a stream increased. In our analytical 1D models, we utilized two equations that described upslope area, (a) A = Bl, where B is the profile width [L], and l is the stream length from the ridge [L] and (b) A = Clh, Hack’s Law, where C is a constant [L2-h] and h is a positive exponent. With these equations, (a) m = n and (b) hm = n resulted in scale invariance. In our numerical 2D models, the relationship between A and l was inherent in the actual structure of the drainage network. From our numerical 2D results, scale invariance occurred when 2m = n. Additionally, using reasonable values from the literature for exponents, n, m and h, resulted in singularities at the ridges in the landscape, which caused truncation error. In consequence, the elevation of the ridge increased as the number of grid cells in the domain increased in the numerical model, and the model was unable to converge. These singularities at the ridges appeared when (a) m ≥ n and (b) hm ≥ n in the analytical model and 2m ≥ n in the numerical model. Here we present (1) 1D analytical solutions and (2) 2D numerical solutions that demonstrate scale invariance in LEMs and (3) the consequences of the singularity in 2D LEM numerical simulations. These results will help provide insight about the structure and dynamics of landscapes and drainage networks and shed light on geomorphological empirical relationships.",

Here, we analyze 31 years of daily summer temperature data from surface stations in the GHCND archive, and identify regions of the US that experience heat waves synchronously via a cluster analysis. Focusing on the northeastern quarter of the US, a region that contains the major population centers of the eastern seaboard and the majority of the Corn Belt, we find that heat waves are associated with characteristic sea surface temperature (SST) patterns in the extratropical Pacific as early as 40-50 days preceding the heat wave. We perform leave-one-out cross validation to test the skill of predictions based on the Pacific SST patterns and find that they outperform baseline predictions based on persistence and climatology for lead times up to 50 days before a heat wave. Interestingly, other oceanic regions, including the tropics, do not exhibit as clear an association with northeastern heat extremes. The presence of the Pacific anomaly patterns does not have a similarly strong relationship with the median or lower percentiles of the daily temperature distributions, indicating that the increase in extremes associated with the occurrence of the anomaly pattern is not simply a reflection of a uniform upward shift in the temperature distribution.",

Fluid flow through fractured hard rock is very much dependent on the fracture network pattern in the rock mass and on the flow behavior through these fractures. This research deals with fluid flow behavior through fractures at an abandoned copper mine in southeast Korea. An injection well and three observation wells were installed at the mine site to monitor the hydraulic heads induced by injection of fresh water. A series of packer tests were performed to estimate the rock mass permeability and corresponding effective hydraulic aperture of the fractures. The three dimensional stochastic fracture network model was built and validated for the mine site. The two dimensional linear pipe network systems were constructed in directions of the observation wells using the fracture network model. A procedure of the fluid flow analysis on two dimensional discrete domain was applied to estimate the conductance, flow quantity and nodal head in the 2-D linear pipe channel network. The present results indicate that fracture geometry parameters (orientation, density and size) play an important role in the hydraulic characteristics of fractured rock masses.",

            "abstract": "Windbreaks are common features in flat agricultural landscapes around the world. The reduction in wind speed afforded by windbreaks is dictated by their porosity, location, height, and distance from the windbreak. The reduction in wind speeds not only reduces potential wind erosion; it also reduces crop evapotranspiration (ET) and provides shelter for livestock and crops. In the Canterbury plains of New Zealand there are over 300,000 km of windbreaks which were first implemented as a soil conservation strategy to reduce wind erosion of prime agricultural land. Agriculture in the region has since changed to irrigated pasture cultivation for dairy production and windbreaks are being cut down or reduced to heights of 2 m to allow for large scale centre-pivot irrigation schemes. Although soil erosion is no longer a major concern due to permanent pasture cover, irrigation water is sourced from limited supplies of ground and surface water and thus the effects of wind on irrigation losses due to spray drift and increased ET are of significant concern. The impact of reducing windbreaks needs to be understood in terms of water resources use. Experimental and theoretical work was conducted to quantify the reduction in wind speeds by windbreaks and in spray evaporation losses. A temporal and spatial model was also developed and validated to quantify the impact of single and multiple windbreaks on irrigation water losses. Initial modelling results show that for hot windy dry conditions in Canterbury, ET can increase by up to 1.4 mm/day when windbreaks are reduced to 2 m in height and on average wind days ET can increase by up to 0.5 mm/day. ET can be reduced by up to 30% in the windbreak leeward zone relative to ET in areas not protected by windbreaks. Wind speed, air temperature and relative humidity all had a considerable impact on spray evaporation losses, but the extent is determined by the droplet size. Estimated losses range from only 0.07% to 67% for 5 and 0.2 mm droplet sizes respectively. Preliminary measurements of typical irrigation spray nozzles with a range of drop sizes show losses of up to 30% under high wind conditions. Potential reduction in ground and surface water resources use for irrigation can be significant if windbreaks are maintained by using irrigation systems that can be adapted to work within windbreaks.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the lithospheric structure beneath northeast India and combine it with earthquake focal mechanisms and GPS derived velocity vectors to study the kinematics of the Eastern Himalayan System. Our experiment comprised an array of 13 broadband seismographs located on the Eastern Himalayan foreland, Shillong Plateau, Mikir Hills, and Bengal Basin. We use P-receiver functions and joint inversion with Rayleigh wave group velocity dispersion to model the crust and upper mantle structure. We observe that the crust beneath Shillong Plateau, Mikir Hills and the Eastern Himalayan foreland has similar Vs and Vp/Vs, and felsic in nature. However, the crustal thickness varies 3-dimensionally. The central Shillong Plateau and Mikir Hills have the thinnest crust (31±2 km). The crustal thickness increases abruptly by 10±2 km north of Mikir Hills, while it increases gradually north of the Shillong Plateau. From earthquake source mechanisms, we observe that the crustal thickness variation is associated with thrusting of the Plateau and Mikir Hills over the eastern Himalayan foreland. The Kopili fault zone between the Plateau and Mikir Hills is marked by dextral strike-slip earthquakes, whose slip vectors match the GPS derived relative velocity vectors. Across the southern edge of the Plateau, marked by topographic break and surface trace of Dwaki fault, the crustal thickness changes abruptly from 36±2 km (south Shillong Plateau) to 22±2 km (north Bengal Basin) and thins further southward to 16±2 km. This change is associated with a sharp transition from felsic to mafic crust. This intermediate thickness mafic crust resembles thinned passive continental margin crust, and underlies the entire eastern Bengal Basin. This crust is overlain by the thickest pile (18-20 km) of continental sedimentary strata. Moderate earthquakes south of the Shillong Plateau originate within the Bengal Basin crust and have strike-slip mechanism. These earthquakes obliquely accommodate a part of the GPS inferred convergence between the Plateau and the Bengal Basin. We finally conclude that the uplift of the Shillong Plateau and Mikir Hills is controlled by flexure and faulting of the Indian crust to the north and by abrupt change in crustal structure to the south. This in turn controls the distributed deformation in the Eastern Himalayan System.",

            "abstract": "A near-linear relationship between warming (T) and cumulative carbon emissions (Q) is a robust finding from numerous studies. This finding opens biophysical questions concerning (1) its theoretical basis, (2) the treatment of non-CO2 forcings, and (3) uncertainty specifications. Beyond these biophysical issues, a profound global policy question is raised: (4) how can a quota on cumulative emissions be shared? Here, an integrated survey of all four issues is attempted.\n(1) Proportionality between T and Q is an emergent property of a linear carbon-climate system forced by exponentially increasing CO2 emissions. This idealisation broadly explains past but not future near-proportionality between T and Q: in future, the roles of non-CO2 forcings and carbon-climate nonlinearities become important, and trajectory dependence becomes stronger.\n(2) The warming effects of short-lived non-CO2 forcers depend on instantaneous rather than cumulative fluxes. However, inertia in emissions trajectories reinstates some of the benefits of a cumulative emissions approach, with residual trajectory dependence comparable to that for CO2.\n(3) Uncertainties arise from several sources: climate projections, carbon-climate feedbacks, and residual trajectory dependencies in CO2 and other emissions. All of these can in principle be combined into a probability distribution P(T|Q) for the warming T from given cumulative CO2 emissions Q. Present knowledge of P(T|Q) allows quantification of the tradeoff between mitigation ambition and climate risk.\n(4) Cumulative emissions consistent with a given warming target and climate risk are a finite common resource that will inevitably be shared, creating a tragedy-of-the-commons dilemma. Sharing options range from “inertia” (present distribution of emissions is maintained) to “equity” (cumulative emissions are distributed equally per-capita). Both extreme options lead to emissions distributions that are unrealisable in practice, but a blend of the two extremes may be realisable. This perspective provides a means for nations to compare the global consequences of their own proposed emissions quotas if others were to act in a consistent way, a critical step towards achieving consensus.",

The extracted tidal amplitudes and phase delays of some of the Sun-related tides (P1, S1K1, S2 and K2) exhibit obvious annual cycles of variation, with some of the amplitude variations reaching 30% and phase delays 30° respectively, while those of the Moon-related tides (Q1, N2 and M2) do not show annul cycles. The inferred annual cycles of the Sun-related tides cannot be explained by the inaccuracies of relative Earth-Sun positions at different seasons. Neither can they be explained by the annual variations of sea water loading.

            "abstract": "The marine nitrogen (N) cycle is a dynamic system of critical importance, since nitrogen is the limiting nutrient in over half of the world’s oceans. Denitrification and anammox, the main N loss processes from the ocean, have different effects on carbon cycling and greenhouse gas emission. Understanding the balance between the two processes is vital to understanding the role of the N cycle in global climate change. One approach for investigating these processes is by using stable isotope analysis to estimate the relative magnitudes of N fluxes, particularly for biologically mediated processes. In order to make the most of the currently available isotope analysis techniques, it is necessary to know the isotope effects for each processes occurring in the environment. Nitrite reduction is an important step in denitrification. Previous work had begun to explore the N isotope effects for nitrite reduction, but no oxygen (O) isotope effect has been measured. Additionally, no consideration has been given to the type of nitrite reductase carrying out the reaction. There are two main types of respiratory nitrite reductase, one that is Cu-based and another that is Fe-based. We performed batch culture experiments with denitrifier strains possessing either a Cu-type or Fe-type nitrite reductase. Both N and O isotope effects for nitrite reduction were determined for each of these experiments by measuring the NO2- concentration, as well as the N and O isotopes of nitrite and applying a Rayleigh fractionation model. Both the N and O isotope effects were found to be significantly different between the two types of enzymes. This enzyme-linked difference in isotope effects emphasizes the importance of microbial community composition within the global N cycle.",

            "abstract": "Understanding reactive transport of solutes in porous media underlies problems ranging from in-situ remediation or natural attenuation, to quantifying redox processes and/or precipitation rates in natural biogeochemical cycling, to design of geothermal systems. Despite decades of research, we remain essentially unable to predict multicomponent reactive transport in natural porous media. We report on a new approach to upscaling mixing-limited reactive transport, that combines a Lagrangian focus on transport of the moving interface between the mixing solutions, with kinetics of mixing-limitation governed by scalar dissipation rates. We treat the moving interface between reacting solutions as a chain of individual strips, or lamellae, after Ranz, and Villermaux, and upscale mixing-limited reaction extent using the scalar dissipation of an analogous passive solute after de Simoni. Given the statistical description of how the entire set of lamella behave (achievable in principle for any given rendition of a porous media), the problem reduces to one of predicting the reactions on a given lamella as it evolves kinematically due to stretching and diffusion. This simplification reduces much of the complexity while honoring the mixing on the lamella during its advection along with the moving front. The resulting framework for upscaling reaction extent is: a. characterize the deformation of the individual lamellae, b. determine the reaction extent on each one, and c. sum the reaction extents on each lamella to obtain an expression for global reaction extent. We describe details of the development and demonstrate its utility in several idealized problems by comparison to explicit numerical simulation of the reactive transport processes. The Figure below shows a linear flood with flow left-to-right in a 2D heterogeneous flow field,with solution B displacing solution A. The left panel shows influent solution boundary at initial time to as dashed line on left with an individual lamella shown in zoom, original length rho=1 and width so. The right panel shows same lamella at later time after stretching and diffusion dictate new length rho=1 and width s.",

            "abstract": "Data and its management are central to modern scientific enterprise. Typically, geoscientists rely on observations and model output data from several disparate sources (file systems, RDBMS, spreadsheets, remote data sources). Integrated data management solutions that provide intuitive semantics and uniform interfaces, irrespective of the kind of data source are, however, lacking. Consequently, geoscientists are left to conduct low-level and time-consuming data management tasks, individually, and repeatedly for discovering each data source, often resulting in errors in handling.\nIn this talk we will describe how the EarthCube GeoDataspace project is improving this situation for seismologists, hydrologists, and space scientists by simplifying some of the existing data management tasks that arise when developing computational models. We will demonstrate a GeoDataspace, bootstrapped with “geounits”, which are self-contained metadata packages that provide complete description of all data elements associated with a model run, including input/output and parameter files, model executable and any associated libraries. Geounits link raw and derived data as well as associating provenance information describing how data was derived. We will discuss challenges in establishing geounits and describe machine learning and human annotation approaches that can be used for extracting and associating ad hoc and unstructured scientific metadata hidden in binary formats with data resources and models. We will show how geounits can improve search and discoverability of data associated with model runs. To support this model, we will describe efforts related towards creating a scalable metadata catalog that helps to maintain, search and discover geounits within the Globus network of accessible endpoints. This talk will focus on the issue of creating comprehensive personal inventories of data assets for computational geoscientists, and describe a publishing mechanism, which can be used to feed into national, international, or thematic discovery portals.",

The school’s infrastructure allows for real time data transfers, and eager young students monitor the instruments and report any recorded events. The reporting feature (“Caught it? Report it!”) through our website works as a crude type of detection to inform us of what instruments pick up the earthquakes. It also has the added benefits of keeping schools engaged in the program, ongoing learning about earth science and geography, and obviously keeps them returning to our website. A network of professional and amateur seismologists provides support to the schools and helps promote earth science education and earthquake risk awareness. The data is publically available through the IRIS DMC and is used by not just our volunteers but also by government departments, universities and private agencies for research and monitoring. One of the challenges has been to provide a way for schools and to interact with the real time data in an accessible format. We have achieved this through website and mobile app development alongside step-by step how to guides. These tools have the added advantage that they also allow schools without their own seismometer to connect with nearby schools that do. The government run national network of seismometers in Australia is sparse; the AuSIS program provides additional instruments that are now being incorporated into the national network for improved regional earthquake locations. Although schools are not the ideal site for broadband seismometers, the program has proven that with a well-chosen location within the school we can recover high quality data for much of the day. The schools are generally well distributed across the country enabling the program to supplement the national network at the same time as bringing earth science to rural communities that often miss out on this type of opportunity.",

The system is composed of three consecutive ponds, each with a total depth of 9 to 13 m deep. Groundwater is the sole water source for the ponds, and the clear water, lush flora, and rare indigenous fish that characterize these wetlands typically lure thousands of divers to the Ponds each year. Over the past century, agricultural practices in the area have changed the hydrology of this system in many ways; first with an extensive system of drains on both sides of the Ponds to make the surrounding area viable for agricultural use, subsequently with the dredging of the outflow of the Ponds and addition of synthetic fertilizers, and most recently with heavy aquifer pumping for widespread use of center pivot irrigation systems. Beginning in the 1970s, diebacks in the Ponds’ flora were documented, concurrent with spikes in nutrient concentrations. In nearby waters, reductions in key wetland species have been observed during periods of high alkalinity (pH>10). Following these concerns, the current study aims to quantify the water budget within the ponds, identify sources of nutrients, and estimate the age of groundwaters entering the wetlands for correlation with longterm agricultural trends. Groundwater ages were sampled in May 2014 and analysed for Carbon 14 and SF6, in addition to the installation of salinity and water level sensors and flow gaging. Preliminary results show that approximately 70 percent of the water enters the system through groundwater inflow in the first pond, with the remaining water entering within the third pond. A slight increase in the electrical conductivity of the ponds (average 750 μS in the first pond, up to 800 μS in the third pond) also differentiates the water.",

            "abstract": "Despite massive investments in food aid, agricultural extension, and seed/fertilizer subsidies, nearly 1 billion people in the developing world are food insecure and vulnerable to climate variability. Sub-Saharan Africa is most vulnerable, as approximately 25% of its people are undernourished (FAO/FAOSTAT 2013) and 96% of its cropland is rainfed (FAO 2002). The ability of subsistence farmers to respond to changes in water availability involves both inter-and intra-seasonal adaptation. Adaptive capacity diminishes over the season as decisions are made, resources are used, and the set of possible futures becomes restricted. Assessing the intra-seasonal adaptive capacity of smallholders requires integrating physical models of hydrological and agricultural dynamics with farmer decision-making at fine temporal (e.g. weekly) and spatial (e.g. crop field) scales. However, there is an intrinsic challenge to modeling the dynamics of these sociohydrologic systems, because important and uncharacterized spatial and temporal scale mismatches exist between the level at which the water resource is best understood and the level at which human dynamics are more predictable. For example, the skill of current process-based land surface models is primarily confined to short-term (daily to weekly), national- to regional-scale assessments, and reliable agricultural yield estimates and forecasts for small-scale farming systems remain elusive. In contrast, process-based social science modeling has focused on agent-based approaches that generate fine-scale (individual to community) dynamics over rather coarse time scales (yearly to decadal). A major obstacle to addressing this mismatch is the fundamental fact that the highest skill domain of one framework is essentially unpredictable in the other. We present a coupled sociohydrological observation framework designed to addressing this gap, and demonstrate its utility to understand relationships between climate variability, decision making, and crop production for subsistence agriculturalists in Kenya and Zambia.",

            "abstract": "Polar Mesospheric Summer Echoes (PMSEs) have commonly been attributed to scattering from (1) volume-filled electron density turbulence and (2) extremely sharp (meter-scale) gradients in electron density. In-situ sounding rockets have measured both extended regions of turbulence as well as electron density ledges. Unlike the turbulence theory, which has been extensively studied, a theory on the formation of sharp edges has yet to be explored. In this study, we reconsider the study of Gumbel et al. [2002] on the influences of ice particles on the ion chemistry and propose a theory of ice-plasma feedback instability in order to explain the origin of sharp electron density gradients. A one-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation of a multi-constituent weakly-ionized plasma has been developed to capture the physics of proton-hydrates (H+[H20]n), ice, and plasma interactions on a spatial grid of approximately 25 m. The simulation captures (1) the development of the proton-hydrate chain starting at n=4 via Thomson’s model and Natanson’s recombination scheme, (2) the formation of ice nucleation on large cluster proton-hydrates (n > 73), (3) the attachment of electrons (and ions) to ice particles, and resulting depletion of the plasma density, which significantly accelerates the proton-hydrate chain and ionic nucleation of new ice particles, (4) and the development of an ice-plasma feedback instability whereby the repeated process of developing new ice particles leads to capture of even more electrons and further depletion of existing regions of lower plasma density. Since this feedback instability process is faster than typical aerosol diffusion rates in this region, existing gradients steepen to produce electron density ledges. Although ionic nucleation is not feasible as the major mesospheric nucleation process, it can become efficient locally, near the coldest parts of the mesosphere because the proton-hydrate chain development is extremely sensitive to ambient temperature. As a result, the mesospheric temperature gradients may be responsible for vertically localized and horizontally extended meter-scale electron density ledges as has been detected by numerous in-situ sounding rockets and inferred from radar specular echoes.",

The goal of this research will be to develop a deeper understanding of energy and momentum transfer from Saturn’s magnetosphere into the neutral atmosphere of Titan. A hybrid particle code is used to examine the energy and momentum transferred to Titans atmosphere by ion precipitation and electron currents. The code includes models representing Titan's ion-neutral ionospheric chemistry, Hall and Pederson conductivities, ion-neutral collisions and atmospheric densities and winds from the TGITM atmospheric code.

            "abstract": "Bathymetric surveys can be difficult at tidal and navigational inlets, yet knowledge of the changing bathymetry is important to many applications (e.g. navigational planning, dredging). Estimation of bathymetry using only remote sensing observations would enable a more continuous view of the evolving bathymetry at an inlet. Herein, we report on progress towards this goal at two sites with drastically different dominant dynamics that were the focus of the research program DARLA: New River Inlet, NC, and Mouth of the Columbia River, OR/WA.\nWe use an ensemble-based data assimilation methodology employing a modeling system based on coupled circulation and wave models (specifically, the COAWST modeling system). The models are two-way coupled, and therefore account for the influence of the tidal currents on the waves, but also the influence of wave forcing on the circulation. The use of such a coupled modeling system also enables us to utilize observations of different geophysical variables. In particular, we utilize surface current maps obtained using an airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar system, and wavelength information (for several frequency bands) obtained using a tower-mounted X-band radar system. We contrast the two sites by discussing data availability and coverage, information content in each observation type (with respect to bathymetry estimation), and influence of the dominant dynamics on the bathymetry estimates. Finally, we explore the efficacy of the method with only short-dwell observations of currents and waves (hence, not relying on long-dwell observations over multiple tidal cycles) and report on the resulting bathymetry estimates.",

We find that measurements during the freeze/thaw shoulder seasons, especially the fall refreeze, are critical to accurate evaluation of the annual carbon budget for Alaska.

This technique provides a powerful tool for studying such flow systems and the results give valuable insight into flow processes at the pore scale. The fluid-fluid interface curvature from the images can be used to estimate the local capillary pressure. The velocity measurements illustrate active and passive flow pathways and circulation regions near the fluid-fluid interfaces induced by shear.

            "abstract": "Arctic tundra ecosystems appear to be responding to rapid climatic warming via changes in vegetation composition and increased woody biomass, which may induce significant shifts in ecosystem structure and function. Although understanding these shifts is important for predicting ecosystem trajectories, establishing methods for quantifying and scaling woody plant biomass in low-stature biomes is challenging. We used LiDAR data from a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) to estimate harvested biomass and leaf area of two dominant low-stature (<1.5 m) Arctic shrub species (Salix pulchra Cham. and Betula nana L.) in small (0.64 m2) plots. We explored two biomass estimation approaches (volumetric surface differencing and voxel counting) applied to point clouds obtained from either close-range (2 m) or variable-range (<50 m) TLS scans. Relationships between harvested biomass and laser scan metrics were strong for all combinations of approaches. Voxel counting provided a marginally better result than surface differencing for close-range scans (R2 = 0.94 vs 0.92; RMSE = 102 g vs 117 g), while surface differencing proved stronger than voxel counting for variable-range scans (R2 = 0.90 vs 0.79; RMSE = 128 g vs 184 g). Strong relationships between total harvested biomass and total leaf dry mass (R2 = 0.93; RMSE = 13.4 g), and between leaf dry mass and leaf wet area (R2 = 0.99; RMSE = 9.01 cm2) justify estimation of shrub leaf area from TLS-derived shrub biomass. Our results show that rapidly acquired, repeatable terrestrial laser scans taken from multiple distance ranges can be processed using simple algorithms to yield aboveground biomass and leaf area estimates for low-stature shrubs at fine spatial scales (sub-meter to 50 + meters). These data have the fidelity required to monitor small but ecologically meaningful changes in tundra structure, and could be employed as ground reference data for broader scale remote sensing data collection to provide shrub biomass and leaf-area estimates at fine resolution over large spatial extents.",

However, it has also been reported that microseism could be generated at mid ocean and propagate as the body waves, such as P, PP and PKP phases. In this study, we analyzed microseisms with seismic records from seismic stations that are located at northern continental Asia. These included seismic arrays and a local dense network at South Korea, Kazakhstan, and China. First, we computed seismic noise spectra in the frequency band between 0.01 and 0.4 Hz. Second, the back-azimuth and the phase velocity of the microseism were measured from the frequency-wavenumber (FK) analysis. Although each data set was recorded at different time periods, the results show similar patterns. Non-transient microseism peak around the 0.2 Hz frequency was observed coherently at all data of winter season. The FK analysis shows that this microseism propagated with the phase velocities of around 12, 11, and 21 km/s at South Korea, China, and Kazakhstan, respectively. The back-projection of the FK result shows that these body wave microseisms were mostly generated at the northern part of the Pacific.",

In this algorithm, the inversion method is a combination of maximum a posteriori (MAP) method (Rodgers, 2000) and the Phillips-Twomey method (Phillips, 1962; Twomey, 1963) as a smoothing constraint for the state vector. Furthermore, with the progress of computing technique, this method has being combined with the direct radiation transfer calculation numerically solved by each iteration step of the non-linear inverse problem, without using LUT (Look Up Table) with several constraints.\nRetrieved parameters in our algorithm are aerosol optical properties, such as aerosol optical thickness (AOT) of fine and coarse mode particles, a volume soot fraction in fine mode particles, and ground surface albedo of each observed wavelength. We simultaneously retrieve all the parameters that characterize pixels in each of horizontal sub-domains consisting the target area. Then we successively apply the retrieval method to all the sub-domains in the target area.\nWe conducted numerical tests for the retrieval of aerosol properties and ground surface albedo for GOSAT/CAI imager data to test the algorithm for the land area. The result of the experiment showed that AOTs of fine mode and coarse mode, soot fraction and ground surface albedo are successfully retrieved within expected accuracy. We discuss the accuracy of the algorithm for various land surface types.\nThen, we applied this algorithm to GOSAT/CAI imager data, and we compared retrieved and surface-observed AOTs at the CAI pixel closest to an AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) or SKYNET site in each region. Comparison at several sites in urban area indicated that AOTs retrieved by our method are in agreement with surface-observed AOT within ±0.066.\nOur future work is to extend the algorithm for analysis of AGEOS-II/GLI and GCOM/C-SGLI data.",

Despite the importance of N to carbon (C) storage, we still lack an understanding of how trees compete for N belowground. In the Northeasters UN, trees associate with two main groups of fungal symbionts which supply the plant nitrogen, either ectomcorrhizal (ECM) or arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Since ECM creates an extensive hyphal network and has strong enzymatic capabilities, they are generally favored in forests with low N availabilities; however they have a higher C demand.\nHere we attempt to provide a more thorough understanding of whole-plant carbon allocation in temperate forests, by quantifying wood, foliar, and root NPP, as well as belowground C allocation to ECM fungi. The study was conducted across plots with a range of N availability and tree species composition within Bartlett Experimental Forest (BEF), NH, a current NEON site.\nIngrowth core-methods utilized in the study indicate there is high soil fungal biomass in N-poor sites than at N-rich sites with the N-poor sites averaging at 600 grams of fungal carbon per meter squared compared to the N-rich sites having less than 200 grams. Soil, foliar, and root N isotopes (δ15N) show evidence of enhanced N isotope fractionation and C allocation to mycorrhizal fungi in the N-poor sites. Results from this study are being used to incorporate C allocation to mycorrhizal fungi into a process-based forest ecosystem.",

A companion study (Niespolo et al., 2014) utilized these data to source Mesoamerican jadeitite artifacts, as this region is the only source for such materials. Materials studied include jadeitites that range from 71% to 95% jadeite with minor albite and white mica. Jadeitites north of the MFZ have δ18OJadeite = +9.2±0.6‰ (n=6), δ18OAlbite = +9.4±0.3 (n=2), δ18OWhiteMica = +9.8±0.3 (n=3), and δDWhiteMica = –52± 4‰ (n=3). Jadeite δ18O values are 2-5‰ higher than those reported by Johnson and Harlow (1999), suggesting a diverse fluid history north of the MFZ. Water in apparent equilibrium at 400°C with north MFZ jadeitite has δ18O = +8.5‰ and δD = –25‰. Jadeites from Carrizal Grande south of the MFZ have δ18OJadeite = +6.8±0.6‰ (n=7), δ18OWhiteMica = +9.0±1.2 (n=6), and δDWhiteMica = –42±2‰ (n=5), with δ18OH2O = +6.4‰ and δDH2O = –15‰. In contrast, jadeitites from La Cieba south of the MFZ have δ18OJadeite = +7.5±1.4‰ (n=5), δ18OAlbite = +9.0, δ18OWhiteMica = +9.7±0.1 (n=2), and δDWhiteMica = –42±0‰ (n=2), with δ18OH2O = +7.2‰ and δDH2O = –14‰. Calculated fluids are consistent with those associated with the alteration of serpentinite in a subduction zone setting (e.g., Harlow and Sorenson, 2005). White mica, albite and jadeite are out of 18O/16O equilibrium. This suggests post-jadeite isotopic exchange, possibly during exhumation. North MFZ jadeites are enriched in Rb, Ba, Sc, Pb and Nd, and depleted in Sr, Ti, V, and Cr relative to chondrites. Carrizal Grande jadeites are depleted in Sr, Zr, V, and Cr, and enriched in REE and Rb.",

            "abstract": "Sri Lanka, a relatively large island (length 440 km; width 225 km), occupies a unique location within the equatorial belt in the northern Indian Ocean with the Arabian Sea on its western side and the Bay of Bengal on its eastern side and experiences bi-annually reversing monsoon winds. This allows for the Island to interact with the seasonally reversing monsoon currents leading to the the island mass effect and enhanced primary production. We will present elements of the dynamics of the surface circulation and coastal upwelling in the waters around Sri Lanka using satellite imagery and numerical simulations using the Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS). The model was run for 4 years to examine the inter-annual, seasonal and shorter term (~10 days) variability. The results confirmed the presence of the reversing current system, between the equator and Sri Lanka, in response to the changing wind field: the eastward flowing Southwest Monsoon Current (SMC) during the Southwest (SW) monsoon transporting 11.5 Sv and the westward flowing Northeast Monsoon Current (NMC) transporting 9.5 Sv during the Northeast (NE) monsoon, respectively. A recirculation feature located to the east of Sri Lanka during the SW monsoon, the Sri Lanka Dome, is shown to result from the interaction between the SMC and the Island of Sri Lanka. Along the eastern and western coasts, during both monsoon periods, flow is southward converging along the south coast (see Figure). During the SW monsoon the Island deflects the eastward flowing SMC southward whilst along the east coast the southward flow results from the Sri Lanka Dome recirculation. The major upwelling region, during both monsoon periods, is located along the south coast resulting from southward flow converging along the south coast and subsequent divergence associated with the offshore transport of water(see Figure). Higher surface chlorophyll concentrations were observed during the SW monsoon. The location of the flow convergence and hence the upwelling centre was dependent on the relative strengths of wind driven flow along the east and west coasts: during the SW (NE) monsoon the flow along the western (eastern) coast was stronger migrating the upwelling centre to the east (west).",

            "abstract": "One of the current challenges in the field of monitoring and verification is source discrimination of low-yield nuclear explosions from background seismicity, both natural and anthropogenic. Work is underway at the Nevada National Security Site to conduct a series of chemical explosion experiments using a multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary approach. The goal of this series of experiments, called the Source Physics Experiments (SPE), is to refine the understanding of the effect of earth structures on source phenomenology and energy partitioning in the source region, the transition of seismic energy from the near field to the far field, and the development of S waves observed in the far field. To fully explore these problems, the SPE series includes tests in both hard and soft rock geologic environments. The project comprises a number of activities, which range from characterizing the shallow subsurface to acquiring new explosion data from both the near field (<100 m) and the far field (>100 m). SPE includes a series of planned explosions (with different yields and depths of burials), which are conducted in the same hole and monitored by a diverse set of sensors recording characteristics of the explosions, ground-shock, seismo-acoustic energy propagation. This presentation focuses on imaging the full 3D wavefield over hard rock and soft rock test beds using a large number of seismic sensors. This overview presents statistical analyses of optimal sensor layout required to estimate wavefield discriminants and the planned deployment for the upcoming experiments.

It has been shown that the model resolution is the key in simulating a lot of atmospheric phenomena. In this study, the summertime heat waves in North America and the associated ridging/blocking activity are characterized using reanalysis data and global climate models with different horizontal resolutions (~120 km / ~30 km) and ocean modules (prescribe/interactive). The typical synoptic features accompanying the heat waves are depicted. The frequency of occurrence and intensity of the upstream blockings are examined.\nThe discrepancy between the reanalysis and the models on the heat wave characteristics as well as the upstream blocking activity is assessed by comparing the passage of synoptic-scale transients and its local reinforcement to the anticyclonic circulation. The result indicates: 1) a general agreement on the first moment of climatological distribution with different resolution; 2) the higher resolution model can improve the high-order moments of the atmosphere circulation, including the weather regimes, which is critical to a reliable simulation and projection of the climate extremes.",

            "abstract": "The study seeks to determine the efficacy of using aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from MISR and MODIS as a surrogate for ground-based particulate matter (PM2.5) data by using AOD as an input for various computational methods. The data set used in the study ranged from January 2011 to December 2012. The advantage of the mixed effects model is in its ability to consider temporally changing attributes through the inclusion of random effects in the regression model. The study first established that MISR and MODIS AOD has a correlation with ground measured PM2.5 through regression analysis thereby providing rationale for further analysis. The regression analyses resulted in an R2 of 0.7513 and 0.7536 for MODIS and MISR, respectively. With the rationale established, data quality improvement measures were carried out through data screening and empirical correction. The data screening process involved the removal of data entries in which the absolute difference of MODIS and MISR AOD values deviated far more than the average of the data set. On the other hand, empirical correction was done by developing correction equations through multivariate regression with ground parameters such as AERONET AOD, relative humidity, and wind speed. Both methods were found to yield marked improvement in the correlation of satellite-derived AOD with PM2.5. After data quality had been improved, several computational methods are assessed by solving for the R2 and absolute error percentage. The methods are simple linear regression with MODIS (R2 = 0.7764, 18.43%) and MISR (R2 = 0.7614, 17.99%), multivariate linear regression with MODIS and MISR together (R2 = 0.8721, 13.63%), artificial neural network with MODIS and MISR as inputs (R2 = 0.8764, 13.45%), and the mixed effects model with MODIS and MISR as predictors (R2 = 0.9793, 5.20%). Among these, the mixed effects model performed the best and further error analysis showing an error that was independent on seasonality and dependent on the PM concentration value. The figure below shows the correlation between ground measured PM2.5 concentration with computed PM2.5 concentration derived from the application of the mixed effect model. This illustrates the capacity of the mixed effects model to compute for the actual PM2.5 data.",

            "abstract": "The role of export of carbon via surface waters has been increasingly appreciated as an important component of ecosystem carbon budgets. However the role of deep regional groundwater as a source of carbon to ecosystems is relatively poorly known. In a lowland rainforest in Costa Rica, inputs of elevated dissolved inorganic C (DIC) in regional groundwater greatly increase stream water C concentrations. Whether that groundwater-derived carbon represents a significant source of elevated CO2 for photosynthesis of riparian plants is unknown. We compared the concentration and δ13C of CO2 in the air above two weir-equipped streams with different inputs of high-DIC regional groundwater. The Taconazo has no inputs, whereas about 40% of stream discharge of the Arboleda is a result of regional groundwater. DIC from regional groundwater experiences little to no within-watershed sequestration and thus augments the C flux out of the watershed with stream flow and possibly the degassing flux from the stream.\nCO2 concentrations were recorded by Vaisala GMP343 gas analyzer over 24 hr periods above the weirs and in the splash zone below the weirs as well as at a small waterfall on the Sura, the higher order stream that the Arboleda joins, approximately 250 m downstream of the junction. Samples of air δ13C-CO2 taken from unmixed (early morning) and mixed (afternoon) canopy air were measured by mass spectrometer. Concentrations of CO2 at both sites on the Taconozo remained in the normal range of canopy storage of respiratory CO2 (< 600 ppm). In contrast, [CO2] above the Arboleda weir occasionally exceeded 1000 ppm and were generally above normal values of respiratory CO2. Values below the weir by the splash zone were often higher than 1500 ppm and occasionally exceeded 2000 ppm. At the Sura waterfall pulses of high CO2 > 1000 ppm occurred regularly throughout the day. We found higher δ13C-CO2 above the Arboleda compared to the Taconazo, consistent with an enhanced flux of isotopically-heavy CO2 from the Arboleda stream. Keeling plots of samples taken at the Arboleda and Sura deviated from those over the Taconazo and indicated a source of 13C other than atmospheric air and respired CO2. Our data suggest that CO2 from regional groundwater has the potential to be available to riparian plants, but primarily at areas of turbulent water flow.",

            "abstract": "A voyage was conducted aboard the RV Southern Surveyor in early 2013 to investigate the east Australian continental margin. From the continental slope of the Wide Bay region offshore Fraser Island, Queensland, Australia, remote sensing data and sediment samples were collected. Bathymetric data reveals that the continental slope of the region presents a mature canyon system. Eight dredge samples were recovered from the walls of Wide Bay Canyon and the adjacent, relatively intact continental slope along the entire length of the slope, from the start of the shelf break to the toe, in water depths ranging from 1100-2500 m.\nFor these samples, sediment composition, biostratigraphic age, and bulk mineralogy data are reported. These slope-forming sediments are primarily comprised of calcareous sandy-silts. Occasional terrestrial plant fossils and minerals can be found in a mostly marine-fossiliferous composition, suggesting minor but significant riverine and aeolian input. Biostratigraphic dates extracted from the foraminiferal contents of these samples indicate that the intra-canyon and slope material was deposited between Middle Miocene to Pliocene, implying that the incision of this section of the margin and formation of the erosional features took place no earlier than the Pliocene. In conjunction with bathymetric data of the local continental slope, the depositional origins of this section of the east Australian continental margin, and the timing of major morphological events such as slope failure and canyon incision can be interpreted.\nThe Wide Bay Canyon system can serve as a representative case study of local canyon formation, allowing a better understanding of the past or ongoing processes that are shaping the margin and giving way to similar morphologies.",

            "abstract": "Limitation of offset, lack of low frequencies, and low velocity contrast at shallow marine sediment make it difficult to apply full waveform inversion (FWI) to conventional marine multichannel seismic data. To mitigate these problems, we make use of moderate offset conventional end-on multichannel seismic data, which are transformed to split spread configuration using reciprocity. Data redundancy in split-spread configuration provides better constraints in inversion resulting in a geologically meaningful velocity model. Here, we employ an acoustic FWI [1] in frequency domain with a constant density to resolve fine scale velocity structure of gas hydrate bearing sediments in Krishna Godavari offshore basin from eastern Indian offshore. Conventional multi channel surface seismic data were acquired in 2010 [2] using 360 channels with 12.5m receiver interval, 25m shot spacing and 100m near offset for the investigation gas hydrate in this region. In end-on configuration, we have 400 shot gathers with 360 channels each, which were transformed to split-spread gathers. We make use of a smoothed interval velocity derived from root mean square (RMS) velocity as an initial model with a grid spacing of 12.5m and ran inversion for fourteen frequencies (8 to 21 Hz). The split-spread dataset is able to resolve subsurface features much better than the conventional end-on data. For example, we notice marked improvement in identifying the free gas layer below the hydrate bearing sediments and many structural features like faults are conspicuous in the final image. However, shallow structures with low impedance contrast could not be resolved further using higher frequencies since a lot of high frequency noises/artifacts are created in the model. We use the resulting high-resolution velocity model together with rock-physics model to estimate hydrate saturation within the sediments.\nVirieux, J.; Operto S.

            "abstract": "Supply of suspended sediment is critical for the development and sustainability of tidal wetlands. Suspended sediment concentration (SSC) is also a key parameter used in calibrating wetland accretion models, which aid in understanding restoration dynamics and projecting resilience to sea-level rise. Despite the importance of suspended sediment, few field studies have directly measured SSC within tidal wetlands, relying instead on measurements in adjacent waters or focusing on long-term rates of sediment accretion. We refined and tested a simple method for collecting SSC samples within wetlands on an incoming high tide, using siphon collectors. Bottles were positioned during low tide at set locations along transects extending away from either channels or the lower boundary of the vegetated wetland. This sampling protocol was developed collaboratively, with substantial input from local wetland managers and other stakeholders within the San Francisco Bay area and beyond. Simultaneously, we measured time series of SSC, water level, and tidal currents in the subtidal shallows, on the intertidal mudflats, and in two channels within the wetland. We observed significant sediment export during king tides in the wetland channels. Cumulative suspended sediment flux (SSF) over four days during the January 2014 king tides was approximately 10 tons/m of channel width, towards the bay. During neap tides SSF in the channels was directed landward but was lower in magnitude. Elevated velocities in the channels during ebb king tides suggest that resuspension within the channels, rather than erosion of the wetland, accounts for much of the bayward SSF. Within the wetland, SSC from the siphon samplers was highest at the bayward end of the cross-shore transects, indicating landward sediment flux. Taken together with long term accretion data which indicates sediment accumulation within the wetland, our results suggest that sediment is primarily supplied across the wetland-Bay interface, and exported from the wetland through tidal channels. These findings are relevant to the design and monitoring of restored wetlands, which frequently rely on transport through breaches for sediment supply. They also indicate the importance of accounting for sediment export as well as import in modeling the response of wetlands to sea-level rise.",

            "abstract": "Fractures, whether natural or engineered, exert significant controls over resource exploitation from contemporary energy sources including enhanced geothermal systems and unconventional oil and gas reserves. Consequently, fracture characterization, i.e., estimating the permeability, connectivity, and spacing of the fractures is of critical importance for determining the viability of any energy recovery program. While some progress has recently been made towards estimating these critical fracture parameters, significant uncertainties still remain.\nA review of tracer technology, which has a long history in fracture characterization, reveals that uncertainties exist in the estimated parameters not only because of paucity of scale-specific data but also because of knowledge gaps in the interpretation methods, particularly in interpretation of tracer data in reactive fluid-rock systems. We have recently demonstrated that the transient tracer evolution signatures in reactive fluid-rock systems are significantly different from those in non-reactive systems (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2013, 2014). For example, the tracer breakthrough curves in reactive fluid-fractured rock systems are expected to exhibit a long pseudo-state condition, during which tracer concentration does not change by any appreciable amount with passage of time. Such a pseudo-steady state condition is not observed in a non-reactive system. In this paper, we show that the presence of this pseudo-steady state condition in tracer breakthrough patterns in reactive fluid-rock systems can have important connotations for fracture characterization. We show that the time of onset of the pseudo-steady state condition and the value of tracer concentration in the pseudo-state condition can be used to reliably estimate fracture spacing and fracture-matrix interface areas.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that glacial ice sheets (Laurentide, Fennoscandian and Antarctic ice sheets) exert a large influence on the climate including the atmospheric circulation. Moreover, recent climate modeling studies suggest that glacial ice sheets have a large impact on the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). However, the process by which the ice sheets impact on the AMOC is not yet fully understood. On the other hand, recent studies showed that surface wind changes play a crucial role on changes to the AMOC under glacial climate. Therefore, in this study, we investigate in detail, the process by which the ice sheet modifies the AMOC through surface wind change. Here we conduct numerical experiments using an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) and an ocean general circulation model (OGCM) separately. Our method consists of 2 steps. First, from AGCM experiments, we evaluate the effect of glacial ice sheets on the surface wind. Second, from OGCM experiments, we evaluate the influence of the wind stress change on the AMOC by applying the surface wind change as a boundary condition, while leaving other boundary conditions (surface heat and water fluxes) unchanged. In addition, we conduct several sensitivity experiments. Using the AGCM, we explore individual ice sheet effect, ice sheet topography effect and albedo effect on surface wind change. Moreover, using the OGCM, we change the surface wind gradually or apply the surface wind change only at a specific region in order to explore the wind change effect in detail. We find that glacial ice sheets largely intensify the AMOC by surface wind change under glacial climate. Compare to other regions, it reveals that the wind change at the North Atlantic (NA) is a key region. There, the northern glacial ice sheet topography intensifies the Icelandic Low and anti-cyclonic circulation over the Laurentide ice sheet. However, this wind effect is effective only when the NA is not widely covered by sea ice. From our sensitivity experiments and previous studies, we conclude that glacial ice sheets intensify the AMOC thorough enhancing the salt transport at high latitude NA surface.",

In 3-D radiative transfer parameterization, we have updated surface topography data from a resolution of 1 km to 90 meters using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) global dataset to improve parameterization accuracy. In addition, we have also modified the upward-flux deviation (3D - PP) adjustment to ensure that energy balance at the top of the atmosphere is conserved in climate simulations involving the 3-D radiation parameterization in a global model. We show that deviations of the net surface fluxes are not only affected by 3-D mountains, but also influenced by cloud feedback in association with the long-term simulations. Deviations in sensible heat and surface temperature generally follow the patterns of net surface solar flux. The monthly SWE deviations averaged over the entire domain show an increase in lower elevations due to reduced snowmelt, leading to a reduction in cumulative runoff. Over higher elevation areas, negative SWE deviations are found because of increased solar radiation available at the surface. Simulated precipitation increases for lower elevations, while decreases for higher elevations with a minimum in April. Liquid runoff significantly decreases in higher elevations after April due to reduced SWE and precipitation.",

Several experiments were carried out in December 2010 by the EISCAT heating facility in Ramfjordmoen, Norway. HF ordinary mode electromagnetic pumping waves were directed with elevation angle of 78 degrees in north-south plane transmitting at a frequency around 4 MHz. The center of the perturbed area in the F region ionosphere is estimated to be 41 km south of the facility. The heating and relaxation intervals were varied between 10 and 180 seconds. The variations in total electron content (TEC) from GNSS carrier phase signals are identified from the data taken from two dual frequency high rate GNSS receivers placed in Ramfjordmoen and in Tromsø with a separation of approximately 14 km. We analyze the links between the two receivers and GLONASS satellites with regard to the relative distance between each piercing point and the estimated heating center over a series of heating intervals. Results shows general trend of increase and signatures of oscillations in slant TEC measurements in both links.",

We obtained the thermal history of the Danba anticline by solving thermokenematic equations for detachment folding. With that, we calculated the corresponding fission track ages based on a chemical kinetic model proposed by Lutz and Omar and compared them with the observed ones to find out the optimal model parameters. Our results show that the Danba anticline is most likely formed by horizontal contraction along a detachment fault at depth about 15 km, corresponding to the brittle-ductile transition in the mid-crust. For the last 25 My, the horizontal shortening is estimated to be about 72 km over a cross section with a width of 180 km. The average contraction velocity of about 2.9 mm/yr but it has been accelerating in a parabolic function to about 5~6 mm/yr at the present time, which is comparable with GPS observations. Our findings suggest that a weak detachement zone should exist beneath the Danba anticline, which might be associated with crustal channel flow.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric turbulence quantities, boundary layer O3 levels and deposition to the tundra surface were investigated at Toolik Lake, AK during the 2011 summer season. Beginning immediately after snowmelt a diurnal cycle in ambient O3 developed, and O3 values measured over tundra throughout the summer varied significantly between nighttime minima of 5 ppbv and daytime maxima of 50 ppbv. The mean amplitude of the diurnal cycle in surface O3 following snowmelt was 13 ppbv, far larger than observed at other high Arctic locations. The diurnal cycle is attributed to a combination of surface deposition to the tundra and stable boundary layer conditions at night, and the entrainment of O3 from higher in the atmosphere during increased daytime mixing. The mean O3 deposition velocity during the month of June was 0.11 cm s-1. O3 deposition to tundra exhibited a diurnal cycle, with daytime mean of 0.2 cm s-1 and nighttime mean of 0.08 cm s-1. These values are slightly lower than previously reported summertime deposition velocities in the northern latitudes over tundra or fen, although measurements for comparison were limited.",

Investigations on stable calcium isotopic compositions of natural geological samples provide a great powerful tool to understand all kinds of those geological processes from a view of the field of isotope geochemistry. With the development of modern instruments and chemical separation techniques, calcium isotopic compositions could be determined even more precisely if the column chemistry brings no deviation.\nUsually, Calcium is separated from matrix elements using cation resin columns and the related chemical separation techniques seem to be robust. However, more detailed work still need to be done on matrix effects and calcium isotopic fractionations on column chemistry or during elution processes. If calcium is run on TIMS instruments, the interference effect could be lower and easier controlled, thus, the requirement to the chemistry is relatively not critic, but calcium fractionation on filaments could be much difficult to monitor. If calcium is run on MC-ICP-MS instruments, the interference effect could be huge and is really difficult to be recognized and subtracted, the requirement to the chemistry is much more critical in order to get a real result of the sample, but the instrument fractionation could be easier to monitor.\nHere we investigate calcium activities on several kinds of cation resins under different column/acid conditions. We seek to find a good balance between recovery and interference effect on column chemistry and are intend to set up a better chemical separation procedure to satisfy the instrument requirements for calcium. In addition, Calcium isotopic fractionation on column will also be discussed further here based on our previous and ongoing results.",

            "abstract": "A growing need for broad dissemination of current scientific research and improved scientific literacy requires new models of professional development that allow for direct collaboration between educators and university researchers. One example is a project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) as part of a study titled, “Reconstructing 2500 years of environmental change at the periphery of Rome: Integrating paleoecology and socioeconomic history to understand human response to climate.” This project involves a team of middle school teachers working with researchers at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) to gain first-hand knowledge in multidisciplinary research connecting science and society, and applies a similar approach in the classroom. In 2013, the team’s science teacher traveled to Italy as a member of the science research group. A series of workshops introduced the remaining teachers to the research project. Teachers collaborated to develop a Project Based Learning (PBL) unit that incorporated Next Generation Science Standards and encompassed English, Social Studies, Math, and Science curricula using a pedagogical approach different from the single subject-based PBL’s usually taught in their school district. The PBL unit draws on the NSF study and focuses on exploring the balance between economic and environmental issues surrounding local wetlands. In May 2014, 160 middle school students worked in groups to create and test a question about physio-chemical parameters in a nearby wetland and used these data to discuss local economic development. Initially, students claimed polarized views of environmental issues or economic development interests; however, during a multimedia session showcasing results, students communicated more informed perspectives that clearly incorporated knowledge gained from their own research. Some students were able to make recommendations for good practices involving planned economic development near the wetland. Preliminary outcomes suggests this model: 1) permits authentic exploration of the role of scientific research in making informed policy decisions; 2) promotes diverse perspectives when approaching environmental and socioeconomic problems; and 3) enhances group engagement in developing scientific literacy.",

            "abstract": "The nitrogen cycle is a global process, largely mediated by microorganisms, that exchanges nitrogen between its biologically available forms (NH4+, NO3-) and its inert (N2) form. This cycle enables the biological uptake of nitrogen for the formation of DNA, amino acids, and other biological compounds critical to life. Several processes are responsible for facilitating the cycling of nitrogen through eight different oxidation states. Two nitrogen removal processes include anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), in which N2 is produced directly from ammonia and nitrite, and denitrification, the sequential oxidation of NO3 to N2. Together, these two processes play a large role in determining the biological availability of nitrogen in estuarine ecosystems.\nTo better understand how microbial communities conducting these processes change under varying environmental conditions, a manipulation experiment was developed to simulate an environmental site salinity shift. Sediment cores were collected from north San Francisco Bay in the Carquinez Strait, a site of seasonally varying salinity. These cores from the Carquinez Strait were incubated in two treatments: one with local brackish water and one with freshwater from Suisun Bay. Using Sanger sequencing, we examined shifts in the microbial communities containing the functional genes hzsA (anammox) and nirS (denitrification). Geochemical characteristics such as NO3- and NH4+ concentrations in the water and the C:N ratio of the sediment were measured to determine subsequent changes these communities had on the sediment chemistry. This study provides insight into how changes in salinity affect microbial sediment community composition in San Francisco Bay.",

However, influences of lower atmospheric gravity waves on the ionospheric variability are still not clear due to the simplified gravity wave parameterizations and the limited knowledge of gravity wave distributions. In this study, we aim to study the longitudinal variations of gravity waves and their impacts of longitudinal variations of low-latitude gravity waves on the ionospheric variability. Our SABER results show that longitudinal variations of gravity waves at the lower boundary of TIME-GCM are the largest in June-August and January-February. We have implemented these low-latitude gravity wave variations from SABER instrument into TIME-GCM model. TIME-GCM simulation results of ionospheric responses to longitudinal variations of gravity waves and physical mechanisms will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "While Scleractinia first appear in shallow tropical seas during the Mid-Triassic, it is unclear when and why these corals established their symbiosis with a dinoflagellate alga (Symbiodinium microadriaticum). The development of this symbiosis was a major evolutionary innovation for corals, which was not previously observed in other coral taxa (Rugosa and Tabulata) and likely contributed to the rise of Scleractinia as the dominant reef builders. Inarguably, this symbiotic relationship is linked to increased calcification rates but dinoflagellate symbioses are also very common in non-calcifying marine invertebrates making it unclear whether the coral host or algal symbiont drives the establishment of this symbiosis. Recently, it has been suggested that the establishment of the coral-algal symbiosis is symbiont driven by the fluctuation of the Mg/Ca ratio of seawater at the beginning of the Mesozoic. Scleractinia precipitate aragonitic skeletons further suggesting they evolved in seawater with a high Mg/Ca ratio and that their mineralogy is linked to their environment. In order to determine how seawater chemistry influences host-symbiont interactions, we grew Pocillopora damicornis in seawater with elevated calcium and magnesium concentrations. Growth rates are higher than the control treatment when the Mg2+ concentration is increased by 200 ppm but are not significantly different than the control treatment when the Ca2+ concentration is increased by 200 ppm, suggesting that calcification is linked to the Mg2+ concentration of seawater. Growth rates are not, however, related to in-hospite symbiont density, which is similar in the control, +200 ppm Ca2+ and +200 ppm Mg2+ treatments. This similarity in symbiont density between treatments suggests that even when the chemistry of the surrounding seawater fluctuates, with respect to Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions, the coral host provides a stable environment in which the symbionts can reside. This preliminary work has implications for understanding the evolution of scleractinian corals and future work will investigate the role of elevated Mg2+ concentrations on the physiology of symbionts grown ex-hospite.",

            "abstract": "Historical magnetic data recorded in ship’s logs on voyages of exploration and trade in the south-west Pacific have been used as a basis for constructing a model of secular variation in the region using spherical cap harmonic (SCH) analysis. The spherical cap used is centred on colatitude 115° and longitude 160° and has a radius of 50°, thus covering New Zealand, Australia and parts of Antarctica. Gaps in the observational data have been filled by an iterative procedure started by using IGRF field values to obtain SCH models for 2000, 1950 and 1900 and assuming that the spherical cap coefficients have a linear variation in time over the 400 year time period of the model, as is observed to a first approximation for Gauss coefficients calculated from a global spherical harmonic analysis. The resulting field models have generally smooth spatial and temporal variations in declination, inclination and intensity which show some differences from the variations calculated using the global spherical harmonic model gufm1. The technique clearly shows promise for producing more refined models of secular variation in the south-west Pacific when the historical data are supplemented by archeomagnetic and paleomagnetic data.",

            "abstract": "East Asian economies have experienced rapid growth over three decades, and the region is one of the world's most populated places. Asian dust and anthropogenic aerosols are considerable over East Asia. They are frequently transported to Korea during the late winter and spring. Trans-boundary dust is transported either as isolated or mixed with anthropogenic aerosols. Consequently, Asian dust and atmospheric aerosols have become an emerging issue resulting in high particulate matter (PM) episode in Korea. The PM forecasting model which has been developed and opened to public since 2007 is an effective tool to protect the public health by detecting the PM episode event and notifying it to the public in advance. Validation of forecasting models using measurements such as surface observations is necessary to assess their reliability, but they are not able to detect spatial and vertical distribution. Vertical profile is crucial to understand the long-range transport of PM.\nIn this study, long-range transports of aerosols were investigated by a integrated analysis of ground-based / space-borne Lidar observations and a numerical forecasting model for the PM episode in 2013. The numerical forecasting using the CMAQ model (Community Multiscale Air Quality) was compared with LIDAR (LIght Detection and Ranging) which is located in Seoul National University (37.46°N, 126.95°E) and CALIOP onboard CALIPSO satellite. Vertical profiles of CALIOP which are the Attenuated backscatter coefficient(532nm), the Depolarization ratio (532nm) and Ratio of attenuated backscatter coefficients (1064nm/532nm) were compared with those calculated from CMAQ output. Altitudinal distribution of extinction coefficient from CMAQ was also compared with vertical distribution of LIDAR extinction coefficient at Seoul.\nResults showed that long-range transports of aerosols originated from China to Korea were observed by the CALIOP and the CMAQ model could depict the long-range transport of PM to identify the PM episode in Korea. Further details of model comparisons and meteorological and chemical characteristics during the haze event will be discussed in the presentation. ",

            "abstract": "The Kanto region in central Japan lies atop of three tectonic plates: the North American Plate, the Pacific Plate, and the Philippine Sea Plate. The collision and subduction of the Izu-Bonin-Mariana (IBM) arc on the Philippine Sea Plate into the Kanto region results in occurring the different type of earthquakes, including seismic slip (e.g., the Kanto earthquake) and aseismic creep (i.e., slow earthquakes around the Boso peninsula). The seismic and aseismic slip seems to generate side by side at almost same depth (probably nearly same P-T conditions). This study focus on frictional property of incoming materials to be subducted into the Kanto region, in order to examine a hypothesis that the different types of slips arise from different input materials. Thus, we have performed friction experiments on rocks that constitute the IBM forearc using a high P-T gas medium apparatus at AIST.\nWe sampled five rocks (marl, boninite, andesite, sheared serpentinite and serpentinized dunite) recovered from the IBM forearc by Leg 125, Ocean Drilling Program (ODP Site 784, 786). The rocks were crushed and sieved into 10˜50 µm in grain size. Experiments were conducted at temperature of 300○C, confining pressure of 156 MPa, pore pressure of 60 MPa and axial displacement rates of 0.1 and 1 µm/s. For marl, andesite and boninite, a periodic stick-slip behavior appears at 1 µm/s. Rise time of the stick-slip behaviors are quite long (3.1, 9.9 and 14.2 sec, for marl, andesite and boninite, respectively). We called such events as a “slow stick-slip”. Similar slow stick-slip behaviors were observed in previous studies (Noda and Shimamoto, 2010; Okazaki, 2013; Kaproth and Marone, 2013), but this is first time to recognize this characteristic slip behavior in sedimentary and igneous rocks. Although it is difficult to discuss the diverse slip behaviors observed at the Kanto region based on our limited experimental results, we will examine the conditions where the transition between stable and unstable sliding appears using the input materials and explore the generation mechanisms of earthquakes at the Kanto region.",

Hamilton, a new instrument based on a reflective spatial heterodyne spectrometer (SHS) at the focus of the Coudé Auxiliary Telescope (CAT). SHS instruments are common path two-beam Fourier transform spectrometers that produce 2-D spatial interference patterns without the requirement for moving parts. The utility of SHS comes from its combination of a wide input acceptance angle (0.5-1°), high resolving power (of order ~105), compact format, high dynamic range, and relaxed optical tolerances compared with other interferometer designs. This combination makes them extremely useful for velocity resolved for observations of wide field targets from both small and large telescopes. This report focuses on the tunable instrument at Mt Hamilton, The CAT provides a test case for on-axis use of SHS, and the impact of the resulting field non-uniformity caused by the spider pattern will be discussed. Observations of several targets will be presented that demonstrate the capabilities of SHS, including comet C/2014 E2 (Jacques), Jupiter, and both the day sky and night glow. Raw interferometric data and transformed power spectra will be shown and evaluated in terms of instrumental stability.",

            "abstract": "Resolving sub-grid-scale interactions between clouds and aerosols is one of the biggest challenges facing climate models in the 21st century. By carefully selecting boundary conditions to represent grid boxes in larger-scale models, an emulator of a cloud-resolving model can be created and implemented in a regional or global model. Emulators can estimate the output of a model, based on a statistical analysis of outputs from simulations with known inputs. This method may reduce uncertainties in a range of cloud-scale processes, including calculations of aerosol indirect radiative effects, precipitation rates, and wet removal rates of aerosol. The Finnish Academy has recently funded the Emulation of Cloud-Aerosol Indirect Radiative Effects (ECLAIRE) project, whose aim is to construct emulators of cloud-scale processes from the WRF-Chem model and implement them into the ECHAM climate model. This poster will describe the goals and proposed methods of the project, together with any initial results.",

We presented the likely inundation areas, current velocities in key ports and harbors, physical damage and repair costs, economic consequences, environmental impacts, social vulnerability, emergency management, and policy implications for California associated with the scenario tsunami. The intended users were those responsible for making mitigation decisions before and those who need to make rapid decisions during future tsunamis. The Tsunami Scenario process is being evaluated by the University of Colorado’s Natural Hazards Center; this is the first time that a USGS scenario of this scale has been formally and systematically evaluated by an external party.\nThe SAFRR Tsunami Scenario was publicly introduced in September, 2013, through a series of regional workshops in California that brought together emergency managers, maritime authorities, first responders, elected officials and staffers, the business sector, state agencies, local media, scientific partners, and special districts such as utilities (http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2013/1170/).\nIn March, 2014, NOAA’s annual tsunami warning exercise, PACIFEX, was based on the SAFRR Tsunami Scenario. Many groups conducted exercises associated with PACIFEX including the State of Washington and several counties in California. San Francisco had the most comprehensive exercise with a 3-day functional exercise based on the SAFRR Tsunami Scenario. In addition, the National Institutes of Health ran an exercise at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in April, 2014, building on the Tsunami Scenario, focusing on the recovery phase and adding a refinery fire.\n The benefits and lessons learned include: 1) stimulating dialogue among practitioners to solve problems; 2) seeing groups add extra components to their exercises that best address their specific concerns; 3) providing groups with information packaged specifically for them; 4) recognizing the value of having scenario developers personally present the scenario to user groups and 5) having the SAFRR work applied to support ongoing activities by and future directions of the California state tsunami program.",

            "abstract": "Plume activity of Enceladus has been monitored by Cassini for nearly one decade after their discovery (see Science, 2006, 311, special issue). Thus, crucial properties of the vapor dust plumes are constrained in a fairly detailed manner. In this paper I discuss implications for vent geometries, gas and grain dynamics and condensation in the vents.\nVapor source rates on the order of 100 to 1000kg/s were derived from remote and in-situ data [2, 3, 4, 1, 17] and distortions in the B field [10, 15]). Gas ejection speeds from 500m/s to 1000m/s [18, 4] (escape speed 240m/s) indicate supersonic gas flow. Evidence for supersonic gas jets is directly seen in UVIS data [3].\nDust production rates between 5 to 50kg/s have been inferred [16, 8]. These do not yet include mass in jets of very fine nano-grains [9, 8, 7]. The dust plume exhibits scale heights that suggest ejection speeds on the order of 100m/s [13, 16, 6], i.e. well below the escape velocity. Larger grains have smaller ejection spees populating the lower parts of the plume [6, 16]. Salt has been identified in grains on the percent level [14] so that they cannot form alone by condensation from vapor. The detailed distribution of dust sources and jet orientations on the south polar terrain was derived from images and compared to temperature distributions and to the expected tidal stress pattern from modelling [12].\nA recent observations show that plume brightness varies roughly by a factor of three with the orbital period of Enceladus, suggesting that ejection strength is tidally controlled [11, 5]. A similar variation in the gas discharge is expected but has not yet been observed to date. Remarkably, there is no such correlation of orbital phase and the observed scale height of dust jets.\n[1] Dong et al, JGR, 116, 2011\n[2] Hansen et al, Science, 311, 2006.\n[3] Hansen et al, Nature, 456, 2008.\n[4] Hansen et al, GRL, 38, 2011.\n[5] Hedman et al, Nature, 2013.\n[6] Hedman et al, ApJ, 693, 2009.\n[7] Hill et al, JGR, 117, 2012.\n[8] Ingersoll and Ewald, Icarus, 216, 2011.\n[9] Jones et al, GRL, 36, 2009.\n[10] Meier et al, submitted to PSS, 2014.\n[11] Nimmo et al, AstronJ, 148, 2014.\n[12] Porco et al, AstronJ, 148, 2014.\n[13] Porco et al, Science, 311, 2006.\n[14] Postberg et al, Nature, 474, 2011.\n[15] Saur et al, GRL, 35, 2008.\n[16] Schmidt et al, Nature, 451, 2008.\n[17] Smith et al, JGR, 115, 2010.\n[18] Tian et al, Icarus, 188, 2007.",

            "abstract": "Element-free method (EFM) has been applied to seismic modeling and migration. Compared with finite element method (FEM) and finite difference method (FDM), it is much cheaper and more flexible because only the information of the nodes and the boundary of the study area are required in computation. In the EFM, the number of Gauss points should be consistent with the number of model nodes; otherwise the accuracy of the intermediate coefficient matrices would be harmed. Thus when we increase the nodes of velocity model in order to obtain higher resolution, we find that the size of the computer's memory will be a bottleneck. The original EFM can deal with at most 81×81 nodes in the case of 2G memory, as tested by Jia and Hu (2006).\nIn order to solve the problem of storage and computation efficiency, we propose a concept of Gauss points partition (GPP), and utilize the GPUs to improve the computation efficiency. Considering the characteristics of the Gaussian points, the GPP method doesn’t influence the propagation of seismic wave in the velocity model. To overcome the time-consuming computation of the stiffness matrix (K) and the mass matrix (M), we also use the GPUs in our computation program. We employ the compressed sparse row (CSR) format to compress the intermediate sparse matrices and try to simplify the operations by solving the linear equations with the CULA Sparse’s Conjugate Gradient (CG) solver instead of the linear sparse solver ‘PARDISO’. It is observed that our strategy can significantly reduce the computational time of K and Mcompared with the algorithm based on CPU.\nThe model tested is Marmousi model. The length of the model is 7425m and the depth is 2990m. We discretize the model with 595x298 nodes, 300x300 Gauss cells and 3x3 Gauss points in each cell. In contrast to the computational time of the conventional EFM, the GPUs-GPP approach can substantially improve the efficiency. The speedup ratio of time consumption of computing K, M is 120 and the speedup ratio time consumption of RTM is 11.5. At the same time, the accuracy of imaging is not harmed. Another advantage of the GPUs-GPP method is its easy applications in other numerical methods such as the FEM. Finally, in the GPUs-GPP method, the arrays require quite limited memory storage, which makes the method promising in dealing with large-scale 3D problems.",

            "abstract": "The design of better management practices in forested watersheds to face climate change and the associated increase in the frequency of extreme events requires a better understanding of watershed responses to extreme events in the past and also under management regimes. One of the most sensitive watershed processes affected is sediment yield. Lake sediments record events which occur in a watershed and provide an opportunity to examine the interaction of storms and forest management practices in the layers of the stratigraphy. We hypothesize that timber harvesting and road building since the 1900s has resulted in increases in sedimentation; however, the passage of the Oregon Forest Practices Act (OFPA) in 1972 has led to a decrease in sedimentation. Sediment cores were taken at Loon Lake in the Oregon Coast Range. The 32-m deep lake captures sediment from a catchment highly impacted by recent land use and episodic Pacific storms. We can use sedimentological tools to measure changes in sediment production as motivated by extreme floods before settlement, during a major timber harvesting period, and after installation of forestry Best Management Practices. Quantification of changes in particle size and elemental composition (C, N, C/N) throughout the cores can elucidate changes in watershed response to extreme events, as can changes in layer thickness. Age control in the cores is being established by Cesium-137 and radiocarbon dating. Given the instrumental meteorological data and decadal climate reconstructions, we will disentangle climate driven signals from changes in land use practices. The sediment shows distinct laminations and varying thickness of layers throughout the cores. Background deposition is composed of thin layers (<0.5 cm) of fine silts and clays, punctuated by thicker layers (3-25 cm) every 10 to 75 cm. These thick layers consist of distinctly textured units, generally fining upward. We interpret the thick layers in Loon Lake to be deposited by sediment-producing floods throughout much of the 1500-year lifespan of this lake. We will explore the relationship between sedimentation, land use, and climate forcing events to determine if the OFPA is having an effect on reducing sedimentation rates as a result of extreme magnitude storm events.",

            "abstract": "Levees and dikes form extensive flood protection infrastructure that often also serve critical water conveyance functions. We have studied the use of radar remote sensing for providing health assessment of levees, focusing on California’s levee system. The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, which lies directly east of San Francisco Bay, is an area comprised of tidal marshland and reclaimed land in the form of ~60 islands surrounded by 1700 km of levees. Improved knowledge of subsidence across the region is needed to maintain the integrity of the Delta levee system, which protects the integrity and quality of the state’s primary water supply. The western Delta is particularly critical because levee failure in this area would rapidly draw water of high salinity content into the channels conveying the fresh water supply. Here we report on a study that uses radar interferometry to measure the spatially and temporally varied levee movement and subsidence in the area, focusing particularly on Sherman Island, the westernmost island of the Delta. We use data from NASA's L-band (23.79 cm) Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) collected at 6-week average interval from July 2009 through the current day. We show preliminary results for localized movement on and near the levees and for island-scale subsidence and discuss the techniques used for these measurements and how they could contribute to emergency response.",

Net radiation is a key component in assessing the energy balance of the surface and heat fluxes interface the atmosphere. This study examines the spatiotemporal distribution of net radiation (Q*) and its four components: incoming shortwave (K↓), outgoing shortwave (K↑), incoming longwave (L↓), and outgoing longwave (L↑) under all sky conditions across Lake Huron using remotely sensed data. Eleven years (2002-2012 ) of daily visible and thermal data with multi-spatial resolution of 1 km to 5 km were analyzed. Good agreement is found between the 30 minute observed average net radiation and instantaneous estimates made from the satellite data with the correlation coefficient of 0.92 and 0.75 under clear sky and all sky condition respectively. Results showed that Q* and all of its components significantly changed over the study period. Trend analysis revealed that significant decrease of the Q* at the rate of 0.003 Wm-1 d-1 with significantly decrease of shortwave (K↓ and K↑) and significantly increase of longwave (L↓ and L↑). Here, we discuss variations in the seasonal spatial distributions patterns and relationships of these four components to the recent climate change, and present explanations for these phenomena. In spite of change in cloudiness, we also explain some of the likely factors which are possible relate to decline in net radiation.",

            "abstract": "Considerable attention has been given to the climate feedbacks associated with predicted vegetation shifts in the Arctic tundra in response to global environmental change. However, little is known regarding the extent to which consumers can facilitate or respond to shrub expansion. Arctic ground squirrels, the largest and most northern ground squirrel, are abundant and widespread throughout the North American tundra. Their broad diet of seeds, flowers, herbage, bird’s eggs and meat speaks to the need to breed, feed, and fatten in a span of some 12-16 weeks that separate their 8-9 month bouts of hibernation with the potential consequence to impact ecosystem dynamics. Therefore Arctic ground squirrels are a good candidate to evaluate whether consumers are mere responders (bottom-up effects) or drivers (top-down) of the observed and predicted vegetation changes. As a start towards this question, we measured the foraging intensity (giving-up densities) of Arctic ground squirrels in experimental food patches within which the squirrels experience diminishing returns as they seek the raisins and peanuts that we provided at the Toolik Lake field station in northern Alaska. If the squirrels show their highest feeding intensity in the shrubs, they may impede vegetation shifts by slowing the establishment and expansion of shrubs in the tundra. Conversely, if they show their lowest feeding intensity within shrub dominated areas, they may accelerate vegetation shifts. We found neither. Feeding intensity varied most among transects and times of day, and least along a tundra-to-shrub vegetation gradient. This suggests that the impacts of squirrels will be heterogeneous – in places responders and in others drivers. We should not be surprised then to see patches of accelerated and impeded vegetation changes in the tundra ecosystem. Some of these patterns may be predictable from the foraging behavior of Arctic ground squirrels.",

            "abstract": "Pyrope-rich garnets originated from the upper mantle underneath the Colorado Plateau occur at the Garnet Ridge. These garnets contain the following lamellae of hydrous and anhydrous minerals; Rt, Ilm, crichtonites, Cr-Spl, Amp, Cpx, Chl, rarely Apt, srilankite and carmichealite. The origin of these lamellae in the garnets is controversial; exsolved origin or epitaxial growth. We emphasize here the close relations between the presence of hydrous lamellae and the OH concentrations in the host garnets. Lamella phases were identified with a standard-less quantitative EDS system and a laser Raman spectrometer with Ar+ laser (514.5 nm). OH concentrations in garnets were quantitated on the basis of IR absorption spectra of garnet by micro FT-IR method using IR absorption coefficient (8770 L/mol/cm2, Katayama et al., 2006).\nPyrope-rich reddish brown garnet (group B by Sato et al., AGU2014F) has large variations of major chemical compositions (Prp: 49-76, Alm: 6-43, Grs: 6-26 mol%), and OH contents (2-177 ppm wt. H2O). Among this group garnets, Ca-rich ones (Prp: 49-66; Alm: 18-28; Grs: 16-26 mol%) have lamellae of both hydrous (Amp and Chl) and anhydrous (Rt, Ilm, and Cpx) minerals. Amp and Chl lamellae are pargasitic amphibole and clinochlore, respectively, and their host garnets contain significantly low amounts of OH (2-42 ppm).\nCr and pyrope-rich garnet (group A by Sato et al., AGU2014F) has chemical compositions of Prp: 67-74, Alm: 13-18, Grs: 7-11 mol% with Cr2O3 up to 5.9 wt.%, and contains lamellae of anhydrous minerals (Rt, Ilm, crichtonites, and Cr-Spl). The host garnet with these anhydrous lamellae contains a little higher OH ranging 24 to 115 ppm.\nSummarizing the present results, the OH contents of the host garnets depend on the presence of hydrous silicate lamella phase; OH in the garnet with hydrous silicate lamellae is lower than that in the garnet with anhydrous lamellae. The precursor OH incorporated in the host garnet structure was exsolved as hydrous silicate lamellae.",

            "abstract": "Changes in Arctic ice pack deformation between 2000 and 2010 are quantified using triads of drifting buoys to calculate ice shear and divergence. In 2006, an abrupt change in shear magnitude and divergence variance occurred, after which ridging and opening rates increased as did the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of shear and divergence. Deformation peaked during the 2007 extreme minimum summer ice extent and there appears to be a recovery-scale time for the mechanical ice response to this event of at least four years. However, by the end of 2010 the ice pack is still more mobile than prior to the 2006 step change. Increased ice mobility and deformation is likely caused by an increase in the mechanical response to atmospheric forcing and enhanced ice-ocean stress rather than stronger forcing, as wind speeds have not increased during this period. Increased opening rates result in increased areas of lead ice, especially entering summer 2008, that likely preconditioned the ice pack for enhanced melt.",

In this study, we try to clarify 1) the formation process of slickenside and 2) the influence of slickenside on faulting behavior. For these purpose, we observed the slickenside developed in limestone along Glarus thrust from micro- to nano- meter scale observations using FE-SEM, TEM and AFM. Moreover, we performed a series of experiments to simulate slickenside on Carrara marble using a rotary shear apparatus. The experimental conditions are normal stress: 1.0 – 5.0 MPa and at slip rate: 0.1 m/s.\nThe observations on natural slickenside reveal that 1) the slickenside was formed within the cataclastic layer, 2) the slickenside itself is a very thin layer (less than 100 nm thick), 3) the surface of the slickenside is composed of oblate nano-grains, and 4) it shows the self-affine roughness property. Through the experiments, we could reproduce the slickenside having the same microstructural characteristics described above as those in Glarus thrust. The experiments reveal that 1) the frictional coefficient decreases with increasing slip distance and normal stress and 2) the oblateness of nano-grains forming the slickenside surface tends to be larger with increasing normal stress. The microstructural observation of the recovered samples suggest that the formation process of the slickenside is same as that of tribofilm.",

Our research plan has brought together colleagues from several international institutions, all with a common goal to better understand the large “continental-scale” characteristics and impacts of gravity waves on the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere (MLT) environment over Antarctica. ANGWIN combines complementary measurements obtained using new and existing aeronomy instrumentation with new modeling capabilities. To date, our activities have focused on developing coordinated airglow image data of gravity waves in the MLT region at the following sites: McMurdo (US), Syowa (Japan), Davis (Australia), Halley (UK), Rothera (UK), and Comandante Ferraz (Brazil). These are all well-established international research stations that are uniformly distributed around the continental perimeter, and together with ongoing measurements at South Pole Station they provide unprecedented coverage of the Antarctic gravity wave field and its variability during the extended polar winter season. This presentation introduces the ANGWIN program and research goals, and presents first results on trans-Antarctic wave propagation using coordinated measurements during the winter season 2011. We also discuss future plans for the development of this exciting program for Antarctic research.",

            "abstract": "Normal-mode spectra may be used to investigate the large-scale anelastic structure of the entire earth. The relevant theory was developed a few decades ago, however, mainly due to computational limitations, several approximations are commonly employed, and thus far the full merits of the complete theory have not been taken advantage of. In this study, we present an exact algebraic form of the theory for an aspherical, anelastic and rotating earth model in which either complex or real spherical harmonic bases are used. Physical dispersion is incorporated into the quadratic eigenvalue problem by expanding the logarithmic frequency term to 2nd order. In addition, we carry out numerical experiments up to 3 mHz to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of commonly used approximate mode synthetics. We find that (1) approximating mode frequencies for realistic earth models with an average over degenerate frequencies of two coupled modes for physical dispersion, Coriolis effects and perturbed kinematic energy terms gives rise to subtle di\u001bfferences in mode spectra; (2) taking into account the exact normalization of modes instead of the one for a spherical, non-rotation model improves mode spectra by ~2%; (3) consideration of mode coupling in a narrow frequency band yields up to 10% discrepancies in mode spectra compared with wide-band coupling, indicating that the popular splitting function approach may introduce slight biases in normal-mode tomography.",

            "abstract": "The coronal mass ejection (CME) event on April 3, 2010 is the first fast CME observed by STEREO SECCHI/HI for the full Sun-Earth line. Such an event provides us a good opportunity to study the propagation and evolution of CME from the Sun up to 1 AU. In this paper, we study the time-dependent evolution and propagation of this event from the Sun to Earth using the 3D SIP-CESE MHD model. The CME is initiated by a simple spherical plasmoid model: a spheromak magnetic structure with high speed, high pressure and high plasma density plasmoid. We find that the results can successfully reproduce the observations in the STEREO A/B COR1 and COR2 field of view and generate many basic structures of the in situ measurement: such as the similar curves of the plasma density and velocity, an increase in the magnetic field magnitude, the large-scale smooth magnetic field rotation and prolonged southward IMF (a well known source of magnetic storms). The MHD model gives the shock arrival time at Earth with an error of ∼ 1.5 hours. Finally, we analyze in detail the propagation velocity, the spread angle, the trajectory of CME. The speed of the CME rapidly increases from near the Sun, then decreases due to interaction with the solar wind ambient. The spread angle of the CME quickly increases due to lateral material expansion by the pressure gradients within the realistic solar wind background, then the expansion decreases with distance and ends until a pressure equilibrium is established. We also study the CME deflection and find that the CME almost does not deflects in the latitudinal and longitudinal direction during its propagation from the Sun to 1 AU.",

            "abstract": "The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, which features strong oceanic surface warming over the equatorial eastern Pacific, has major climatic and societal impacts. In particular, it greatly influences the yearly variations of tropical cyclone (TC) activities in both the Pacific and Atlantic basins via atmospheric dynamical factors such as vertical wind shear and stability. Until recently the direct ocean thermal control of ENSO on TCs has not been taken into consideration because of a mismatch in both timing and location. ENSO peaks in winter and the warming occurs along the equator, a region without TC activity. Here, we present evidence that El Niño discharges its heat into the eastern north Pacific basin 2-3 seasons after it peaks. This basin is characterized by abundant TC activity and is the second most active TC region in the world. As a result, an “El Niño heat reservoir” underneath the ocean surface is delivered to this basin during the TC season (boreal summer/fall) following the winter time peak of El Niño. ENSO exerts a delayed and stealth ocean thermal control on the overlying TCs that can draw the heat out from below the ocean surface, which provides an additional ocean heat supply favorable for the formation of hurricanes with strong intensities. This thermal control on intense TC variability has significant implications for seasonal predictions and long-term projections of TC activity over the eastern north Pacific.",

            "abstract": "Bali province of Indonesia is worldwide known for its tourist destination and it contributes more than 60 per cent to the regional domestic product. Meanwhile, agricultural sector including rice production still plays an important role in the Bali economy because of its 30 per cent contribution. Rice production in Bali is not just susceptible to loss caused by flood, drought and pest and disease attack but also from the climate change. The impact of climate change on food production in Indonesia is expected to decline in 2050, ranging from 38 per cent to more than ten-folds of the current production (Syaukat, 2011). Accordingly, adaptation to climate changes is required to minimize the risk along with the plans and strategies for food security and sustainable development.\nThe government of Indonesia (GoI) has launched several pilot projects including agriculture insurance program to minimize the risk in production failure particularly rice farming, unfortunately Bali was excluded from the projects. Implementation of agriculture insurance in Indonesia has the legal basis now after the announcement of the Farmer Protection and Empowerment Act (Law No. 19/2013). Agriculture insurance is seen better in mitigating farmer’s risk than that of the other program in rice production. The GoI plans to implement the insurance scheme in the beginning of 2015. This scheme is something “new” to farmers in Bali and Indonesia. Considering the importance of crop insurance to agriculture, this study attempts to explore the potential of such insurance to reveal a clear picture of opportunities and challenges in agriculture insurance implementation in Bali. The study empirically presents awareness and perception of farmers towards the insurance and adaptation to vulnerability of climate change. The study concludes with various suggestions for increasing the awareness of farmers for ensuring better penetration of agriculture insurance in Bali.\nKey words: agriculture insurance, farmer’s awareness and perception, climate change, Bali",

            "abstract": "The Death Valley regional groundwater flow system encompasses a proposed site for a high-level nuclear waste repository of the United States of America, the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS), where nuclear weapons were tested, and National Park and BLM properties, and provides water for local communities. The model was constructed using a three-dimensional hydrogeologic framework and has been used as a resource planning mechanism by the many stakeholders involved, including four United States (U.S) federal agencies (U.S. Department of Energy, National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) and local counties, towns, and residents. One of the issues in recent model development is simulation of insufficient water to regional discharge areas which form springs in valleys near the center of the system. Given what seems to be likely rock characteristics and geometries at depth, insufficient water is simulated to reach the discharge areas. This “surprise” thus challenges preconceived notions about the system. Here we use the hydrogeologic model to hypothesize alternatives able to produce the observed flow and use the groundwater simulation to test the hypotheses with other available data. Results suggest that the transmissivity measurements need to be used carefully because wells in this system are never fully penetrating, that multiple alternatives are able to produce the springflow, and that one most likely alternative cannot be identified given available data. Consequences of the alternatives are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Evidence for metasomatic enrichment of the shallow lithospheric mantle by CO2-rich melts (carbonatites) has been documented in peridotite xenoliths entrained in alkali basalts all over the world. The strongest chemical and isotopic imprint of a carbonatite melt is preserved in peridotites that were formerly very depleted (i.e., harzburgite or dunite) because there is little or no pre-existing clinopyroxene (and its trace element budget) to dilute the carbonatite metasomatic signature. Clinopyroxene in many spinel peridotite xenoliths from New Zealand are LREE-enriched, HREE-depleted, have very low K and Ti/Eu, and high Th/U. Several of these properties are indicative of reaction between depleted peridotite and carbonatite during devolatisation reaction: carbonatite + orthopyroxene = clinopyroxene + olivine + CO2. Isotopic analysis of clinopyroxene grains in affected peridotites, particularly of those that were already extremely depleted, indicates that the carbonatite melts have generated isotopic compositions in lithospheric mantle peridotite of 87Sr/86Sr ~ 0.703, eNd ~ +5, 206Pb/204Pb ~ 20 and eHf ~ +5. The compositions generated by these CO2-rich melts is very close to the values commonly quoted for the HIMU mantle component inferred to exist in the source of many ocean island and continental intraplate basalts. Subsequent low-degree partial melting of the carbonatite-refertilised spinel facies peridotitic lithosphere could therefore generate a basaltic magma low in HREE and K, high in LREE, and with an apparent HIMU-like source composition. The lost CO2 should migrate upwards towards the crust. CO2-rich melts in the mantle may therefore play a role in the long-term geological carbon cycle. Scott et al.

            "abstract": "Lake Kai-ike is a saline meromictic lake located along the coast of Kami-Koshiki Island. The lake is isolated from ocean by a gravel bar, through which seawater infiltrates by tidal pumping. The lake is permanently redox (density)-stratified with a mid-depth development of photic zone anoxia and a dense community of photosynthetic bacteria pinkish “bacterial plate”. The early diagenesis of sulfur in sediments overlain by an anoxic water body was investigated using a sediment core (KAI4) from the lake. We determined abundance of various S-bearing species (i.e., Cr-reducible sulfide (= pyrite S: Spy), acid-volatile sulfide (AVS), sulfate sulfur (SSO4), elemental sulfur (S0), and organic sulfur) by an improved sequential extraction method. Here we focus on drastic and rapid changes on sulfur biogeochemistry found in the uppermost 5cm layer.\nWith increasing depth, abundance of Spy increased but that of SSO4 and δ34S value of Spy (δ34Spy) decreased. These results suggest progressive formation of bacteriogenic pyrite. The δ34S values of SSO4 (δ34SSO4) ranged from 25.1 ‰ (at sediment surface) to 3.8 ‰ in the uppermost 5 cm layer. This δ34SSO4 decrease in the top 5 cm sediment suggests that SSO4 in the surface sediment inherits SO42- with elevated δ34S values (higher than typical seawater δ34S value of 21‰) in the water column, which is due to extensive bacterial sulfate reduction with preferential removal of low-δ34S sulfur as sulfide. In the lower part of the uppermost 5 cm layer, SO42- formed by oxidation of S0, AVS, and/or Spy with low-δ34S values by SO42--bearing seawater introduced by infiltration through the gravel bar. Increasing δ34Spy values with increasing depth suggest near complete consumption of SO42- by active bacterial sulfate reduction, and this process could be explained by Rayleigh distillation model.\nEarly diagenesis of sulfur does occur in whole section of 25cm-long KAI4 core that accumulated for the last ~60 years (Yamaguchi et al., 2010; Palaeo3). Geochemical characteristics of sulfur in the uppermost part of Lake Kai-ike sediment were significantly modified during early diagenesis. Such diagenetic modification for sulfur isotopes should be fully taken into account to better reconstruct past anoxic environment such as Cretaceous OAEs and Archean oceans.",

            "abstract": "Earth’s surface environments about 2.7 Ga ago likely experienced drastic changes such as rapid continental growth, negative excursion of organic carbon isotopes, and positive excursion of mass-independently fractionated sulfur isotopes. Discovery of biomarkers indicating cyanobacteria, although questionable, was also claimed. The coeval shallow ocean could have contained appreciable amount of molecular O2 produced by cyanobacteria, but it has been unknown whether deep sea was oxygenated by ocean circulation. In order to unravel the shallow water environment, we obtained modern-weathering-free 2.7 Ga drilcore samples of stromatolitic carbonate and shale by Archean Biosphere Drilling Project (ABDP#10 core) in Meentheena, NE Western Australia. The purpose of this study is to extract information regarding the surface ocean chemistry by abundance (of various species) and corresponding stable isotope compositions of carbon and sulfur.\nBased on mass balance calculation, we obtained a much reduced fraction of organic carbon to total carbon (forg) to be 0.11 (c.f., Phanerozoic average is 0.2), suggesting that aerobic and/or anaerobic decomposition of organic matter was vigorous. The very low δ13Corg values suggest carbon recycling involving methanogenesis by methanogen (e.g., 2CH2O → CH4 + CO2) accompanied by large isotope fractionation. Generated CH4 was oxidized by methylotroph to CO2, which was reused to form organic matter by biochemical processes such as photosynthesis. Either O2 or SO42- was required to facilitate CH4 oxidation, suggesting availability of oxidized species in the 2.7 Ga shallow sea environment. Abundance of Spy with near zero δ34Spy values suggest syndepositional and/or diagenetic formation of bacteriogenic pyrite utilizing sulfate formed by oxidation of mantle-derived sulfur (δ34S ≈ 0‰). A plot of Spy vs. Corg abundance shows a trend falling between a Phanerozoic normal marine trend (Spy/Corg = 0.36) and a freshwater trend (Spy << Corg), suggesting formation of Spy in environments fluctuating between near normal marine and fresh water conditions with low SO42- concentration.\nWe suggest that the 2.7 Ga shallow water near Meentheena was slightly oxic in lacustrine setting.",

            "abstract": "Electron velocity distribution functions (VDFs) during reconnection with negligible guide field from particle in cell (PIC) simulations and Cluster observations are studied to further understand electron acceleration and heating. Until recently, electrons in the exhaust of reconnection with negligible guide field were thought to be isotropic. PIC simulation results with zero guide field reveal that near the time of peak reconnection, VDFs become highly structured in magnetic islands and open exhausts. Ring, arc, and counterstreaming populations are generic and lasting constituents of exhaust electron VDFs. Analyses of particle trajectories indicate that a number of mechanisms including Fermi acceleration, the parallel potential, and adiabatic heating contribute to the energization of exhaust electrons. Near the electron diffusion region (EDR), exhaust electrons exhibit large Te⊥ due to ring and arc populations of electrons accelerated in the EDR. Farther away from the EDR, the VDFs show a mixture of electrons from the EDR and those crossing the separatrix from the inflow. Pitch angle scattering is effective near the exhaust midplane, away from the EDR and before reaching the magnetic pileup region, producing isotropic, high-energy electrons, while the low energy exhaust electrons exhibit the anisotropy Te// > Te⊥ characteristic of the inflow. The work done on the electrons by the perpendicular electric field between the end of EDR and the magnetic pileup region is due to Fermi acceleration which leads to a net increase in the electron's parallel velocity. For the net increase of electrons' v⊥ beyond the EDR, pitch angle scattering effectively converts v// gained by acceleration from the parallel potential into v⊥. Electron's v⊥ further increases downstream through adiabatic heating from the increasing magnetic field in addition to less efficient pitch angle scattering. The parallel potential and the magnetic bottle together determine the trapped-passing boundary of the distribution, and thus the apparent temperature. Thus far, we find no evidence that the parallel potential accelerates passing electrons as suggested by a prior work. Further study is underway to quantify the overall amount of energy which goes into heating electrons and generating counterstreaming beams in the magnetotail.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is projected to jeopardize ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest. Managing ecosystems for future resilience requires collaboration, innovation and communication. The abundance of data and documents describing the uncertainty around both climate change projections and impacts has become challenging to managers who have little funding and limited time to digest and incorporate these materials into planning and implementation documents. We worked with US Forest Service and BLM managers to help them develop vulnerability assessments and identify on-the-ground strategies to address climate change challenges on the federal lands in northwest Oregon (Siuslaw, Willamette and Mt. Hood National Forests; Eugene and Salem BLM Districts). We held workshops to promote dialogue about climate change, which were particularly effective in fostering discussions between the managers who often do not have the time to share their knowledge and compare experiences across administrative boundaries. We used the Adaptation for Conservation Targets (ACT) framework to identify measurable management objectives and rapidly assess local vulnerabilities. We used databasin.org to centralize usable information, including state-of-the-art CMIP5 climate projections, for the mandated assessments of vulnerability and resilience. We introduced participants to a decision support framework providing opportunities to develop more effective adaptation strategies. We built a special web page to hold the information gathered at the workshops and provide easy access to climate change information. We are now working with several Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) to design gateways - conservation atlases - to their relevant data repositories on databasin.org and working with them to develop web tools that can provide usable information for their own vulnerability assessments.",

            "abstract": "Zhud is a term referring either to conditions when melting snow refreezes to form an icy layer covering the grass, or to unusually heavy snow falls in Eurasian arid and semi-arid regions. Under zhud condition, animals cannot obtain food under snow or ice layer, which sometimes results in zhud disaster, i.e. massive livestock kills. It has been recognized that the zhud disaster is directly induced by the harsh winter conditions but often influenced by drought in the previous summer. In this study, data-intensive reanalysis on regional determinants of zhud disaster was conducted for more than 300 soums (an administrative unit equivalent with county in US) in Mongolia. Various climatic, hydrological, and vegetation variables were developed from satellite remote sensing (RS) data, which includes daily mean air temperature, dew temperature, and evapotranspiration, monthly precipitation, and 16-day NDVI from 2003 to 2010. Annual livestock census data were collected for every soums in Mongolia. Each variable was standardized to z-score and utilized for stepwise multiple regression analysis to identify factors statistically significant for explaining soum-level livestock mortality. The regression models were successfully constructed for two-third of total soums. Considerable spatial variability in the determinants of livestock mortality was found across soums in Mongolia. As the primary determinants, summer NDVI and dryness equally explained 22% of the soum mortality, while 33% and 16% of the mortality were explained with winter temperature and precipitation, respectively. In spatial patterns, winter precipitation and temperature were primary determinants in mountain regions and northern cool and semi-arid regions, while summer NDVI and dryness were important in southern hot and arid regions. Our results indicate combined efforts of monitoring RS-based summer NDVI and dryness and forecasting winter temperature and precipitation can provide useful tools for zhud disaster early warning.",

            "abstract": "Gas hydrates were found in the permafrost of Qilian Mountain, Qinghai- Tibet Plateau, China in 2008. It has been found that gas hydrates occur in Jurassic sedimentary rocks, and the hydrated gases are mainly thermogenic. Different from the gas hydrates existing in loose sands in Mallik, Mackenzie Delta, Canada and North Slope, Alaska, USA, the gas hydrates in Qilian Mountain occurred in hard rocks. For understanding the occurrence and formation mechanism of gas hydrate in hard rcok, extensive experimental investigations have been conducted to study the pore features and hydrate formation in the rocks recovered from the hydrate layers in Qilian Mountain. The structures of sedimentary rock were observed by high-resolution X-ray CT, and pore size distribution of a rock specimen was measured with the mercury-injection method. Methane hydrate was synthesized in water-saturated rocks, and the saturations of hydrate in sedimentary rocks of various types were estimated from the amount of gas released from certain volume of rock.\nX-ray CT observation revealed that fractures were developed in the rocks associated with faults, while those away from faults were generally with massive structure. The mercury-injection analysis of pore features found that the porosities of the hydrate-existing rocks were generally less than 3%, and the pore sizes were generally smaller than 100 nm.\nThe synthesizing experiments found that the saturation of methane hydrate were generally lower than 6% of pore space in rocks, but up to 16% when fractures developed. The low hydrate saturation in Qilian sedimentary rocks has been found mainly due to the small pore size of rock. The low hydrate saturation in the rocks might be the reason for the failure of regional seismic and logging detections of gas hydrates in Qilian Mountain.",

            "abstract": "The 200 years since the start of the industrial era has been a period of rapid and almost unbroken economic growth in much of the world, based upon exponentially increasing use of energy and water resources and the atmospheric commons. It is axiomatic that exponential growth cannot continue forever on a finite planet, leading to an emerging collision between the presently irresistible force of economic growth and the immovable reality of the finitude of Planet Earth. This has led to the a contest between two broad narratives about humans and their planet in the 21st century, an “expansion” narrative framed around the paramount need for economic growth, and a “sustenance” narrative framed around the paramount need to protect an increasingly fragile natural world. Many features of recent public discourse, including the acceleration of the news cycle and the echo-chamber effect of interactive social media, have driven these narratives to become progressively more mutually antagonistic and incompatible.\nHere I explore the idea that narratives (in the sense of stories that empower actions) are meme sequences that evolve through diversification, selection and adaptation. This memetic evolution can be understood and, to some extent, influenced. An analogy might be with the influence exerted by human selection over centuries on the gene pool of domesticated animals and plants.\nIn shaping our shared future, the evolutionary contest between “expansion” and “sustenance” narratives is just as important as the dynamics of the natural world. The future therefore depends upon the evolution of more subtle and resilient narratives about human-earth interactions. A selection test for these narratives is their ability to empower a transition to a society that lives within the means of a finite planet and improves global wellbeing at the same time. My own recent experience is that scientists alone are not very good at shaping narratives to pass this fitness test, and the participation of other disciplines and approaches is urgently needed.",

            "abstract": "Since the 1908 Tunguska event, the largest meteor was reported on 15 February 2013 around 03:20:00 UTC. The fireball exploded and dropped near Chelyabinsk, Russia. Massive energy released by meteor crash was recorded by the 500-station ChinArray deployed in southwest China at distances more than 4000 kilometers from the meteor event. About 20 minutes before the meteor event, an M5.8 event occurred in Tonga, and produced seismic waves that overlapped with the seismic signals from the meteor event. Here we separate the seismic phases from the two events using standard array processing techniques such as F-K analysis, beam-forming, and vespagram in the Generic Array Processing (GAP) code (Koper, 2005). F-K analysis provides an effective way to calculate the back azimuth and slowness of a seismic phase. With this method, we identify a phase with back azimuth of 339.1°and slowness of 37.46sec/deg as surface wave from meteor. Beam-forming technique can be used to amplify the signal of meteor generated surface wave and suppress incoherent noise and phases with different slowness from the Tonga event. Vespagram shows the appropriate slowness of ~35sec/deg at arrival of meteor’s phase, confirming the F-K detection of surface wave. From the surface wave observation, we conclude that the seismic source of meteor is located on 61.39N 58.70E, which is ~700km away from the USGS location (55.15N 61.41E). Using the Praha relation [Karnik et al., 1962], we estimate a magnitude of Ms=3.94±0.18 in accordance with that of Ms~3.7 [Benoit Tauzin et al., 2013]. Our result is comparable to other observations with shorter epicentral distances, suggesting that dense seismic arrays can be used to detect weak seismic signals at long-range distances.",

            "abstract": "The worldwide coverage offered by global navigation space systems (GNSS) such as GPS, GLONASS or Galileo allows seismological measurements of a new kind. GNSS-derived total electron content (TEC) measurements can be especially useful to image seismically active zones that are not covered by conventional instruments. For instance, it has been shown that the Japanese dense GPS network GEONET was able to record images of the ionosphere response to the initial coseismic sea-surface motion induced by the great Mw 9.0 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake less than 10 minutes after the rupture initiation (Astafyeva et al., 2013). But earthquakes of lower magnitude, down to about 6.5 would also induce measurable ionospheric perturbations, when GNSS stations are located less than 250 km away from the epicenter.\nIn order to make use of these new data, ionospheric seismology needs to develop accurate forward models so that we can invert for quantitative seismic sources parameters. We will present our current understanding of the coupling mechanisms between the solid Earth, the ocean, the atmosphere and the ionosphere. We will also present the state-of-the-art in the modeling of coseismic ionospheric disturbances using acoustic ray theory and a new 3D modeling method based on the Spectral Element Method (SEM). This latter numerical tool will allow us to incorporate lateral variations in the solid Earth properties, the bathymetry and the atmosphere as well as realistic seismic source parameters.\nFurthermore, seismo-acoustic waves propagate in the atmosphere at a much slower speed (from 0.3 to ~1 km/s) than seismic waves propagate in the solid Earth. We are exploring the application of back-projection and time-reversal methods to TEC observations in order to retrieve the time and space characteristics of the acoustic emission in the seismic source area. We will first show modeling and inversion results with synthetic data. Finally, we will illustrate the imaging capability of our approach with, among other possible examples, the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku-Oki earthquake, Japan, the 2012 Mw 7.8 Haida Gwaii earthquake, Canada and the 2011 Mw 7.1 Van earthquake, Eastern Turkey.",

            "abstract": "Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, accumulates in subsurface hydrocarbon reservoirs. In the Arctic, impermeable icy permafrost and glacial overburden form a ‘cryosphere cap’ that traps gas leaking from these reservoirs, restricting flow to the atmosphere. We document the release of geologic methane to the atmosphere from abundant gas seeps concentrated along boundaries of permafrost thaw and receding glaciers in Alaska. Through aerial and ground surveys we mapped >150,000 seeps identified as bubbling-induced open holes in lake ice. Subcap methane seeps had anomalously high fluxes, 14C-depletion, and stable isotope values matching known coalbed and thermogenic methane accumulations in Alaska. Additionally, we observed younger subcap methane seeps in Greenland that were associated with ice-sheet retreat since the Little Ice Age. These correlations suggest that in a warming climate, continued disintegration of permafrost, glaciers, and parts of the polar ice sheets will relax pressure on subsurface seals and further open conduits, allowing a transient expulsion of geologic methane currently trapped by the cryosphere cap.",

            "abstract": "Most of ambient noise tomography studies performed to date exploit surface waves at periods shorter than 40/50 sec. Two natural questions one may ask are (1) whether longer-period surface wave (>50 s) can also be extracted from ambient noise and (2) whether long-period dispersion curves from ambient noise are accurate enough for tomography to constrain upper-mantle structures. In this study, we investigate the capability of using teleseismic long-period surface waves from ambient noise in regional-, continental- and global-scale surface wave tomography and also evaluate the accuracy of long-period dispersion measurements at periods up to 300 sec. For regional and continental scale studies, we process ambient noise data from USArray to extract inter-station long-period surface wave dispersion curves and then perform surface wave tomography using the dispersion curves. For the global scale studies, we process ambient noise data from more than 1000 stations distributed around the globe, including both permanent FDSN stations and a number of PASSCAL transportable arrays. We observe clear, strong, and coherent long-period surface waves at 50-300 sec periods at both regional and teleseismic inter-station distances. Using long-period dispersion curves from ambient noise, we generate phase velocity maps at 50-300 sec periods and then compare them with those generated from earthquake data. The results show that long-period dispersion measurements from ambient noise are compatible with those from earthquake data and phase velocity maps from ambient noise data and earthquake data are similar to each other, verifying the feasibility and validity of using long-period surface waves from ambient noise in regional, continental and global surface wave tomography. Long-period surface waves from ambient noise are complementary to those from earthquakes. The inclusion of them in regional and global surface wave tomography could significantly increase both lateral and azimuthal path coverage, which is essential to improving the imaging of high resolution heterogeneities and azimuthal anisotropy, especially at regions with large gaps of azimuthal distributions of earthquakes.",

Heated plasma is transported upward, where it can feed efficient energization mechanisms at higher altitude leading to outflow. An additional pathway for upflow is electron heating associated with soft magnetosheath precipitation.

Identifying the use of different pools by community members is the key to estimating their ecological and hydrological functions.\nIn regions with rocky, thin soils in which plant roots also take up water from rock fissures and crevices, it is usually very difficult to locate plant available water pools and quantify their water status or use by plants. Fortunately, we expect dynamic water pools to frequently change isotopic ratios due to rapid recharge and depletion, while reserve pools of water is expected to have distinct isotope ratios and maintain much less variability. Thus, we can use this fact to derive limited quantitative conclusions about the species differences in water use.\nIn order to reveal sources of water used by one karst endemic tree species (Platycarya longipes) established in two typical karst habitats (cliff face and nearby loose rocky soils), stem samples for the tree and one coexistence shallow rooted shrub species (Tirpitzia ovoidea, which was proved to relied on shallow water sources) were collected for 9 times throughout a growing season. Linear relationships (regression slopes were closed to 1) were found between stem water isotope ratios of the two species in each habitat, indicating that the target tree species also relied on water in the dynamic pool. We further discussed the probable water movement mechanism based on the responses of stem water isotope ratios to rainfall.",

            "abstract": "Biomass burning plays an important role in atmospheric chemistry, the global carbon cycle, and climate. The relationship between burning and climate, and the factors that influence burning emissions over long timescales are not well understood. Therefore, well-dated records are needed to establish a history of biomass burning. In this study we examine the distribution of vanillic (VA) and p-hydroxybenzoic (p-HBA) acids in a Siberian Arctic ice core (Akademii Nauk) covering the past 2800 years. These molecules are produced by the incomplete combustion of lignin, incorporated into atmospheric aerosols, and transported/deposited on ice sheets. VA and p-HBA are generated from the combustion of conifers and grasses, respectively, but are not uniquely derived from these sources. These records should be considered qualitative because a wide range of aerosols is generated from various plant materials under different combustion conditions. The records may also reflect changes in source region locations, transport efficiency, and atmospheric removal prior to deposition.\nIce core samples were analyzed using ion chromatography with electrospray MS/MS detection. VA and p-HBA levels were markedly elevated during three time periods. The most recent of these periods occurred from AD 1450-1720 (140-220 m). The timing of two earlier peaks is less well constrained. They are estimated to be from 300-700 AD (400-500 m) and from 800-400 BC (610-670 m). The similarity between VA and p-HBA suggests that the two compounds are derived from a common source. These three periods of elevated VA and p-HBA are not evident in nitrate, ammonium, or black carbon measurements from the same ice core or with high latitude sedimentary charcoal records from North America, Europe, or eastern Siberia.",

            "abstract": "At the very smallest spatial scales of fluvial field analysis, measurements made historically in situ are often now supplemented, or even replaced by, remote sensing methods. This is particularly true in the case of topographic and particle size measurement. In the field, the scales of in situ observation usually range from millimeters up to hundreds of meters. Two recent approaches for remote mapping of river environments at the scales of historical in situ observations are (1) camera-based structure from motion (SfM), and (2) active patterned-light measurement with devices such as the Kinect. Even if only carried by hand, these two approaches can produce topographic datasets over three to four orders of magnitude of spatial scale. Which approach is most useful?\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that both SfM and the Kinect are precise and accurate over in situ field measurement scales; we instead turn to alternate comparative metrics to help determine which tools might be best for our river measurement tasks. These metrics might include (1) the ease of field use, (2) which general environments are or are not amenable to measurement, (3) robustness to changing environmental conditions, (4) ease of data processing, and (5) cost. We test these metrics in a variety of bar-scale fluvial field environments, including a large-river cobble bar, a sand-bedded river point bar, and a complex mountain stream bar.\nThe structure from motion approach is field-equipment inexpensive, is viable over a wide range of environmental conditions, and is highly spatially scalable. The approach requires some type of spatial referencing to make the data useful. The Kinect has the advantages of an almost real-time display of collected data, so problems can be detected quickly, being fast and easy to use, and the data are collected with arbitrary but metric coordinates, so absolute referencing isn’t needed to use the data for many problems. It has the disadvantages of its light field generally being unable to penetrate water surfaces, becoming unusable in strong sunlight, and providing so much data as to be sometimes unwieldy in the data processing stage.",

            "abstract": "Southern ocean clouds are a critical part of the earth’s energy budget, and significant biases in the climatology of these clouds exist in models used to predict climate change. We compare in situ measurements of cloud microphysical properties of ice and liquid over the S. Ocean with constrained output from the atmospheric component of an Earth System Model. Observations taken during the HIAPER (the NSF/NCAR G-V aircraft) Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) multi-year field campaign are compared with simulations from the atmospheric component of the Community Earth System Model (CESM). Remarkably, CESM is able to accurately simulate the locations of cloud formation, and even cloud microphysical properties are comparable between the model and observations. Significantly, the simulations do not predict sufficient supercooled liquid. Altering the model cloud and aerosol processes to better reproduce the observations of supercooled liquid acts to reduce long-standing biases in S. Ocean clouds in CESM, which are typical of other models. Furthermore, sensitivity tests show where better observational constraints on aerosols and cloud microphysics can reduce uncertainty and biases in global models. These results are intended to show how we can connect large scale simulations with field observations in the S. Ocean to better understand Southern Ocean cloud processes and reduce biases in global climate simulations.",

            "abstract": "In order to mitigate disasters from devastating tsunamis caused by large earthquakes occurring in subduction zones, it is necessary to have early warning systems utilizing information from fast determination of rupture processes of the megathrust earthquakes. In this study, we develop a new method for fast and accurate estimation of megathrust rupture processes in the subduction zones, applicable right after occurrence of the earthquakes with large magnitudes, using broadband full waveforms of real-time recording from global seismic network. Most of the tsunami-generating large earthquakes occur on the megathrust faults of subduction regions, locations of which are already known. Therefore, using the most recent numerical models describing the geometries of the plate interfaces in the global subduction zones and the locations of broadband seismic stations in global database, it is possible to calculate Green functions in 3D global earth model well before the occurrence of the earthquake. This will enable the fast calculation of slip models promptly after the earthquake using least square inversion. The resulting slip model can be applied to tsunami model, enabling the fast and accurate prediction of tsunami waves. The applicability of this method is tested with major megathrust earthquakes such as 2011 Tohoku-oki and 2010 Chile earthquake.",

            "abstract": "Stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions (δ18O and δD, respectively) of precipitation are usually measured/ presented as values averaged over rain events or monthly mean values. Such data, especially from tropical stations, seldom throw light on post-condensation processes, viz., isotopic equilibration of rain with water vapour at the cloud base, and evaporation during atmospheric transit, known to affect the isotopic compositions of precipitation and moisture recycling in the atmosphere. Further, the slope ~8 of the linear relationship between such time-averaged values of δD and δ18O (called the Meteoric Water Line, MWL) is widely accepted as proof of equilibrium condensation with little post-condensational alteration. Here, through a simultaneous investigation of isotopic and drop size distributions of seventeen rain events on an intra-event scale at Gadanki (13.5ºN, 79.2ºE), southern India, we show that post-condensation effects, not evident in the time-averaged data, are significantly manifested in sub-samples of individual rain events. We reveal this through (i) slopes significantly less than 8 for the δD - δ18O relation; (ii) significant correlations between deuterium excess (d-excess = dD – 8*δ18O; lower values in rain indicate evaporation) and the mass-weighted average diameter of raindrops (Dm): positive when raindrops evaporate and negative when they isotopically equilibrate with vapor at cloud base. We demonstrate that post-condensation processes, in addition to environmental conditions at source, could affect the d-excess of rain. An estimated ~65% of rain is influenced by the post-condensation processes at the cloud base, of which ~44% is affected by evaporation. Isotope-enabled global circulation models could be improved by incorporating intra-event isotopic data and raindrop size dependent post-condensation processes.",

            "abstract": "Polarimetry provides valuable constraints on atmospheric particle optical and microphysical properties. We have been using imagery acquired by the Airborne Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (AirMSPI) over liquid water clouds to retrieve cloud-top droplet size distributions from multiangular observations in polarized light. AirMSPI is an 8-band ultraviolet-visible-near infrared pushbroom camera, measuring polarization at 470, 660, and 865 nm. It is mounted on a gimbal to acquire multiangular observations over a ±67° along-track range from the NASA ER-2 high-altitude aircraft. Droplet size retrievals from AirMSPI and other multiangular polarimeters typically apply single scattering theory to the spectral and angular structure of polarized radiance in the supernumerary bows (interference fringes from internally reflected and transmitted waves that appear at scattering angles between ~140° and ~165°), using a two-parameter gamma distribution governed by droplet effective radius and variance to model the clouds. However, different values of these parameters are inferred from surface wave-involved interference fringes in polarized radiance observed within the glory region (scattering angles exceeding ~170°). Although multiple scattering can affect the magnitude of such oscillations, it does not affect their angular positions, suggesting the need to account more rigorously for details of the size distribution, vertical stratification, or other effects. Theoretical analysis of AirMSPI supernumerary bow and glory observations in polarized light is being undertaken in an attempt to reconcile the measurements in both angular domains, with the objective of retrieving more details about the cloud tops than can be inferred from supernumerary bow polarimetry alone.",

In this study, a series of laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of rainfall-moving direction and rainfall intensity on runoff generation and soil erosion.3D laser scanner were also used to monitor the slope surface changing. Runoff and sediment samples were taken at 1-min intervals. The results showed that there is one peak sediment concentration in upstream-moving rainfall events but two in downstream-moving rainfall events. Surface sealing greatly affected the sediment grading at the beginning of runoff, which results in less soil erosion. Because of the fully developed crust, the discharge peak occurred after the erosion peak in upstream-moving rainfall events, while two peaks occurred at the same time in downstream conditions. The erosion of downstream moving rainfall events were higher than upstream moving rainfall events under same condition. This study give a better understanding of hillslope erosion and crust development, which will improve the technology of water and soil conservation and numerical erosion simulation",

            "abstract": "Improved understanding of anthropogenic methane emissions is required for closing the global carbon budget and addressing priority challenges in climate policy. Several decades of top-down and bottom-up studies show that anthropogenic methane emissions are systematically underestimated in key regions and economic sectors. These uncertainties have been compounded by the dramatic rise of disruptive technologies (e.g., the transformation in the US energy system due to unconventional gas and oil production). Methane flux estimates derived from inverse analyses and aircraft-based mass balance approaches underscore the disagreement in nationally and regionally reported methane emissions as well as the possibility of a long-tail distribution in fugitive emissions spanning the US natural gas supply chain; i.e. a small number of super-emitters may be responsible for most of the observed anomalies. Other studies highlight the challenges of sectoral and spatial attribution of fugitive emissions – including the relative contributions of dairies vs oil and gas production or disentangling the contributions of natural gas transmission, distribution, and consumption or landfill emissions in complex urban environments. Limited observational data remains a foundational barrier to resolving these challenges. We present a tiered observing system strategy for persistent, high-frequency monitoring over large areas to provide remote detection, geolocation and quantification of significant anthropogenic methane emissions across cities, states, basins and continents. We describe how this would both improve confidence in methane emission estimates and expedite resolution of fugitive emissions and leaks. We summarize recent prototype field campaigns that employ multiple vantage points and measurement techniques (including NASA’s CARVE and HyTES aircraft and PanFTS instrument on Mt Wilson). We share preliminary results of this tiered observational approach including examples of individual methane point sources associated with oil and gas production and distribution, feedlots, and urban landfills in California.",

Cenozoic volcanics (particularly Middle to Upper Eocene) from the Almus and Yıldızeli regions (NE, Turkey) have poorly known and exposed along the northern and southern part of the IAESZ respectively. In this presentation; we present geological, geochemical and isotopic data of these volcanic rocks to characterize the petrological evolution and petrogenesis on the different tectonic blocks.\nAlmus region, have a composite basement of Mesozoic metamorphic and ophiolitic rocks. Volcanic and sedimentary units of the Middle Eocene covering the basement units have a stratigraphic sequence of: a basal conglomerate; fossiliferous sandstone/shale; epiclastic rocks; auto-brecciated lavas with basalt/basaltic andesite lava flows. All these units are cut by trachyte stocks. Besides, basement of Yıldızeli region consisting of Cretaceous Kırşehir block metamorphics with IAESZ melangé and flysch units. Volcanic and sedimentary units covers the basement are trachyte-trachyandesite lavas; fossiliferous limestone; basalt/basaltic andesite lava flows; pyroclastic units with dacitic lavas.\nBasalt/basaltic andesites from Almus region are sub-alkaline/mildly alkaline and display middle to high-K character. REE data display relative enrichments in LILE (Sr, K, Rb, Ba, Th) together with negative anomalies of Nb, Ta and P. Trachyte stocks are shoshonitic and display LILE enrichment together with negative patters of Nb, Ta, P and Eu. Besides, trachyte-trachyandesite and basalt/basaltic andesite from Yıldızeli region are sub-alkaline/mildly alkaline with middle-K to shoshonitic character. REE patterns show enrichments in LILE and depletion of Nb, Ta, P and Ti for both rock suites. The 87Sr/86Sr and 143Nd/144Nd ratios of volcanic rocks from both regions, range from 0.704389 to 0.707134 and from 0.512631 to 0.512867 respectively. Regarding the geochemical and isotopic data, we suggest the mantle sources modified previously by subduction related fluids and/or crustal contamination might played an important role of the evolution of the volcanism in the aforementioned regions.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the budget of OH (hydroxyl radical) is very important for investigating the atmospheric oxidation capacity, aerosol formation and climate change. Recent studies indicate that there may be a great gap between the modeled and measured OH concentrations in some rural forest areas. This gap may result from our incomplete knowledge about the oxidation mechanism of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Here, we suggest that acetyl peroxy radical (CH3C(O)OO∙), the OH-initiated oxidation intermediate of most VOCs, can take the H-atom from the aldehyde group to form corresponding peroxy carboxylic acids. This reaction has not been concerned in the atmosphere. The acetyl peroxy radical may share the “oxidation responsibility” of OH, and help saving OH from being consumed by aldehyde. Using a box model coupled with the isoprene-OH reaction mechanism selected from MCM v3.2, we get OH saving ratio (SROH) when we compare the modeled OH levels in the presence and absence of the reaction of acetyl peroxy radical with aldehyde. We find that SROH is not a constant but a function of OH production rate, reaction time, isoprene concentration and the ratio of aldehyde to isoprene. It is expected that CH3C(O)OO∙ radical, a non-OH oxidant, plays an important role in maintaining the oxidation capacity of the troposphere.",

            "abstract": "The degree to which gravel is exchanged laterally from eroding banks to point bars rather than transported downstream is largely unknown in gravel-bed meanders. This is crucial for understanding the potential effects bank stabilization on channel form. We use a compilation of field data to calculate the number of bends required for the supply of gravel from bank erosion to equal transport rate of gravel through a reach (Nb). A low value of Nb suggests that most of the gravel transport by the river is derived from local bank erosion and that, in essence, gravel is being shifted from outer bank to downstream bars with little net downslope flux. We compared the migration rate in 18 gravel-bed meanders rivers with calculations of the gravel transport capacity. Using the average bend length measured for the reach, and assuming the fraction of gravel in the banks ranged from 0.1 to 0.8 of the bank height, Nb was < 1 bend for 12 of the 18 rivers and generally < 10 bends for the remainder of the rivers. The meanders with Nb<1 had Shields stresses less than 0.044, which is the median Shields stress of 115 gravel-bed meanders in the literature. We compared these results to 9 gravel-bed meanders where gravel transport rates were available but the migration rates were unknown. For these rivers, we assumed migration rates ranged from 0.005-0.1 widths/yr (the range observed for gravel-bed meanders) and the gravel fraction in the banks ranged from 0.1-0.8. Nb was ranged from <1 to 20 bends, but was generally higher than for the gravel-bed meanders where we calculated the gravel transport capacity. This is not surprising because 7 of the 9 rivers had Shields stresses > 0.045, and higher gravel transport rates would be expected for this dataset. Our calculations suggest that for many gravel-bed meanders, gravel is being exchanged between the bed and banks within one bend, and even gravel-bed meanders with higher Shields stresses are likely exchanging gravel within a given reach. Limiting channel migration may have a deleterious effect on gravel routing in many gravel-bed meanders.",

            "abstract": "A fundamental problem for research into modern intraplate seismicity is the short time span of available observations. The geological record holds many examples of large (>106 km2) intraplate areas affected by distributed extension or contraction of low magnitude. Typically, the deformation has remained active over a few tens of millions of years and bulk strains accommodated are a few tens of kilometers. Judging from probable, active counterparts, this deformation was very likely associated with seismicity.\nWe discuss the case of Late Cretaceous and Palaeogene contractional deformation in Europe that created a variety of structures from the British Isles to Poland. Many of these structures are due to inversion of basins and grabens that originated in an earlier phase of distributed extension, but they coexist with large basement-cored uplifts and fault-propagation folds resembling the Laramide structures of Western North America and the modern Sierras Pampeanas in Northern Argentina. The entire fault system is strongly segmented and comprises NW-striking faults linked by N-striking transfer structures. Continuous fault strands rarely exceed a few tens of km in length. Shortening rates are 0.5 to 1.5 mm/yr both for order-of-magnitude estimates of the entire belt and well-constrained local structures, possibly suggesting an episodic, clustered deformation pattern of these structures similar to modern intraplate seismicity. The main phase of intraplate shortening between 90 and 70 Ma can be correlated with a relatively uniform regional stress field reflecting the convergence of Africa, Iberia and Europe. The close juxtaposition of deforming and non-deforming areas thus suggests a control by localized mechanical weakness rather than particularly high stress. On a local scale, this inference is borne out by the frequent reactivation of normal faults.\nOur Mesozoic-Early Paleogene example is probably a suitable model for some, but not all current seismogenic intraplate deformation. The prevalence of large structures in this case, in the Laramides and the Sierras Pampeanas raises the challenging question if regions of active intraplate seismicity that lack such structures are similar phenomena at an immature stage or represent a different phenomenon altogether.",

            "abstract": "Glacial erosion is an important source of sediment and could be an important coupling to glacier and ice sheet models that track sediment. However, glacial erosion is difficult to quantify, and models of glacial erosion can benefit from independent erosion rate estimates. Here we present the results of a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inversion of a cosmogenic nuclide (CN) geomorphic model for glacial erosion rates on a bedrock landform formerly eroded beneath the Laurentide ice sheet. The CN 10Be was measured in quartz to 8 m depth in a bedrock core from the summit of Streaked Mountain, ME. The accumulation of 10Be was modeled over multiple glacial cycles of alternating exposure and glacial erosion. This model was invertedfor glacial erosion rates and burial history using MCMC algorithms implemented in PyMC (Patil et al., 2010). This Bayesian approach allows us to incorporate prior constraints on ice cover history, including oxygen isotope records and radiometric dates, which is otherwise difficult to differentiate from erosion in rapidly eroding areas. We compare these results to depth profile and surface CN measurements elsewhere in Maine (Ploskey and Stone, 2013).The forward model of CN production used in the inversion is part of Cosmogenic (github.com/cosmolab/cosmogenic), an open-source Python-based software library we developed for modeling the growth and decay of in-situ CN inventories in rock during geomorphic evolution. It includes calibrated production rates for 10Be and 26Al in quartz and 36Cl in K-feldspar by both neutrons and muons, with more isotopic production pathways and material targets to be added in the future. Production rates are scaled to the site altitude and latitude using modular scaling schemes. Cosmogenic includes a variety of functions representing common geomorphic histories, and can be used to model any arbitrary exposure, erosion and burial history that can be defined as Python function.",

            "abstract": "The eruption of the Campanian Ignimbrite 40,000 years ago coincided approximately with the final decline of the Neanderthals and a technological and cultural transition from the Middle to Upper Paleolithic. Two end-member hypotheses have been advanced to explain Neanderthal decline: competition with anatomically modern humans and failure to adapt in the face of environmental stresses. The eruption of the Campanian Ignimbrite has been cited as a potentially major cause of such environmental stress. In this work, we draw on published datasets including ice core records, maps and simulations of ash dispersal, and petrologic measurements to constrain the characteristics of the Campanian Ignimbrite eruption. To investigate the climatic effects of the eruption, we use a three-dimensional sectional aerosol model to simulate the global aerosol cloud after 25 Tg and 100 Tg sulfur release scenarios. We couple these aerosol properties to a comprehensive earth system model under last glacial conditions. We find that summer temperatures were colder for several years after the eruption, with some simulations predicting temperature decreases of up to 10 degrees in Eastern Europe and Asia. While this cold interval may have impacted hominid communities in Siberia, the overall distribution of the cooling we observe in our model is inconsistent with catastrophic collapse of Neanderthal populations in Europe. Nonetheless, the volcanic cooling could have influenced daily life for a generation of Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans.",

Propagating the consequences of using RH or VPD in gs models on water cycling and vegetation productivity in future climates in one of the most vulnerable continents, the African continent, remains to be explored.\nUsing process-based global dynamic vegetation model runs, changes in the hydrological cycle and concomitant vegetation productivity for a 21st century projected climate are conducted by altering only gs responses to VPD or RH while maintaining all other formulations unaltered. In the simulations under warming trend of the 21st century, both stomata functions of VPD and RH result in nearly identical changes in the geographic pattern of Gross Primary Production (GPP).

To better understand variability in atmospheric and oceanic Hg0, we collected high-resolution measurements across large gradients in temperature, salinity, and productivity in the Pacific Ocean (20°N-15°S). Surface seawater Hg0 was much more variable than atmospheric concentrations. Peak seawater Hg0 (~130 fM) observed in the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) were ~3-fold greater than surrounding areas (~50 fM), and were comparable to latitudinal gradients found in the Atlantic Ocean. Peak evasion in the northern ITCZ was four times higher than surrounding oceanographic regimes and located where high wind speed and elevated seawater Hg0 coincided. A modeling analysis using the MITgcm-Hg (3D ocean circulation model) and atmospheric inputs from the GEOS-Chem global Hg model (3D biogeochemical model) suggests that higher Hg inputs from enhanced precipitation in the ITCZ combined with the shallow ocean mixed layer in this region can explain observations. Modeled seawater Hg0 reproduced the observed seawater Hg0 peaks in the ITCZ of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans but underestimated the magnitude, likely due to insufficient deep convective scavenging of oxidized Hg from the upper troposphere in the model.

            "abstract": "As the largest known intra-plate strike-slip events, the pair of 2012 earthquakes in the Wharton Basin is a rarity. Separated in time by 2 hours these events rouse interest also because of their short inter-event duration, complex rupture mechanism, and spatial-temporal proximity to the great 2004 Sumatra plate boundary earthquake. Reactivation of fossil ridge-transform pairs is a favoured mechanism for large oceanic plate earthquakes and their inherent geometry triggers earthquakes on conjugate fault systems, as observed previously in the Wharton Basin. The current debate is whether the ruptures occurred on the WNW-ESE paleo ridges or the NNE-SSW paleo transforms. Back-projection models give a complex rupture pattern that favours the WNW-ESE fault [1]. However, the static stress changes due to the 2004 Sumatra earthquake and 2005 Nias earthquake favour the N15°E fault [2]. We use the Teleseismic Body-Wave Inversion Program [3] and waveform data from Global Seismic Network, to obtain the best fit solutions using P and S-wave synthetic modelling. The preliminary P-wave analysis of both earthquakes gives source parameters that are consistent with the Harvard CMT solutions. The obtained slip distribution complies with the NNE-SSW transforms. Both these earthquakes triggered small tsunamis which appear as two distinctive pulses on 13 Indian Ocean tide gauges and buoys. Frequency spectra of the tsunami recordings from various azimuths provide additional constraint for the choice of the causative faults.\n",

In the experiment for TWP-ICE, cloud fraction is overestimated (underestimated) in the upper (lower) troposphere due to the wet (dry) bias. The precipitation rate is well simulated during the active monsoon period, but overestimated during the suppressed monsoon and clear skies periods. In the moist convection scheme, trigger condition and entrainment process affect the lower tropospheric humidity through the impact on convective occurrence frequency and intensity, respectively. Strengthening the trigger condition and using the adaptive entrainment method alleviate the low-level dry bias. In the microphysics scheme, more large-scale precipitation is produced with prognostic rain, due to rain sedimentation considering vertical velocity of rain drop, than with diagnostic rain. Less ice/snow deposition with the prognostic two-ice category results in lower ice water content and upper-level cloud fraction than with the diagnostic splitting method for the twoice category. In the cloud macrophysics scheme, the prognostic cloud fraction and cloud/ice water content scheme produces a larger cloud fraction and more cloud/ice water content than the diagnostic scheme, mainly due to detrainment from moist convection (cloud source) that surpasses the effect of convective heating and drying (cloud sink). This affects temperature by influencing the radiative, convective, and microphysical processes. The experiment with combined modifications in cloud and precipitation schemes shows that interaction between modified moist convection and cloud macrophysics schemes results in more alleviation of the cold bias not only at the lower levels but also at the upper levels.",

Erectophile leaf angle distributions, and/or differences in leaf adaxial and abaxial optical properties allow the leaves to achieve thermal protection. However, these leaf traits complicate any spectral analysis and the study of sclerophyll forest phenology.\nOur goal was to utilize tower mounted phenocam imagery of whole-canopy, multiple tree crowns, and understory layers to trace multi-functional phenology profiles at three sclerophyll forest sites (one banksia dominated and two eucalyptus dominated) all part of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN).\nWe contrast and compare in-situ phenocam time series data with satellite vegetation products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and eddy covariance measures of ecosystem built photosynthetic capacity (ecosystem light use efficiency, LUE, and chlorophyll fPAR).\nWe found that at sclerophyll forests, despite ecosystem photosynthetic capacity exhibiting weak seasonality, climate and in particular rainfall pulses, drove diverse responses over each of the different forest components (e.g. overstory and understory). Interestingly, tree and understory growing and browning cycles were out-of phase, and contributed to the characteristic VI seasonality behavior of the whole ecosystem.",

            "abstract": "The formation of monoclinal right-lateral kink bands in Lake Edison granodiorite (central Sierra Nevada, CA) is investigated through field observations and mechanics based numerical modeling. Vertical faults act as weak surfaces within the granodiorite, and vertical granodiorite slabs bounded by closely-spaced faults curve into a kink. Leucocratic dikes are observed in association with kinking. Measurements were made on maps of Hilgard, Waterfall, Trail Fork, Kip Camp (Pollard and Segall, 1983b) and Bear Creek kink bands (Martel, 1998). Outcrop scale geometric parameters such as fault length andspacing, kink angle, and dike width are used to construct a representative geometry to be used in a finite element model. Three orders of fault were classified, length = 1.8, 7.2 and 28.8 m, and spacing = 0.3, 1.2 and 3.6 m, respectively.\nThe model faults are oriented at 25° to the direction of shortening (horizontal most compressive stress), consistent with measurements of wing crack orientations in the field area. The model also includes a vertical leucocratic dike, oriented perpendicular to the faults and with material properties consistent with aplite. Curvature of the deformed faults across the kink band was used to compare the effects of material properties, strain, and fault and dike geometry. Model results indicate that the presence of the dike, which provides a mechanical heterogeneity, is critical to kinking in these rocks. Keeping properties of the model granodiorite constant, curvature increased with decrease in yield strength and Young’s modulus of the dike. Curvature increased significantly as yield strength decreased from 95 to 90 MPa, and below this threshold value, limb rotation for the kink band was restricted to the dike. Changing Poisson’s ratio had no significant effect. The addition of small faults between bounding faults, decreasing fault spacing or increasing dike width increases the curvature. Increasing friction along the faults decreases slip, so the shortening is accommodated by more kinking. Analysis of these parameters also gives us an insight concerning the kilometer-scale kink band in the Mount Abbot Quadrangle, where the Rosy Finch Shear Zone may provide the mechanical heterogeneity that is necessary to cause kinking.",

Carbonates from the Machari Formation in the Yeongweol Area, South Korea, deposited in the middle to outer carbonate ramp of the Middle to Late Cambrian in age, were investigated to find any correlation between two geochemical proxies. The stratigraphic interval displaying the Steptoean positive carbon isotope excursion (SPICE) corresponds to the interval of negative excursion of δ26Mg values. The SPICE interval shows δ13C values ranging from +0.6 to +4.4‰, and δ26Mg values from −3.0 to −1.0‰. The correspondence of the SPICE with the interval of negative δ26Mg excursion could be caused by the lowering of sea level which increased the rate of input of terrigenous sediments. In short, high rate of influx of terrigenous sediments might have enhanced the rate of burial of organic matter which in turn resulted in the increase of δ13C values of ocean and carbonates, while low δ26Mg values might have been caused by regressive sea level which resulted in the enhanced chemical weathering",

            "abstract": "The Microwave Radiometer Technology Acceleration (MiRaTA) is a 3U CubeSat mission sponsored by the NASA Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO). Microwave radiometer measurements and GPS radio occultation (GPSRO) measurements of all-weather temperature and humidity provide key contributions toward improved weather forecasting. The MiRaTA mission will validate new technologies in both passive microwave radiometry and GPS radio occultation: (1) new ultra-compact and low-power technology for multi-channel and multi-band passive microwave radiometers, and (2) new GPS receiver and patch antenna array technology for GPS radio occultation retrieval of both temperature-pressure profiles in the atmosphere and electron density profiles in the ionosphere. In addition, MiRaTA will test (3) a new approach to spaceborne microwave radiometer calibration using adjacent GPSRO measurements. The radiometer measurement quality can be substantially improved relative to present systems through the use of proximal GPSRO measurements as a calibration standard for radiometric observations, reducing and perhaps eliminating the need for costly and complex internal calibration targets. MiRaTA will execute occasional pitch-up maneuvers so that the radiometer and GPSRO observations sound overlapping volumes of atmosphere through the Earth's limb. To validate system performance, observations from both microwave radiometer (MWR) and GPSRO instruments will be compared to radiosondes, global high-resolution analysis fields, other satellite observations, and to each other using radiative transfer models. Both the radiometer and GPSRO payloads, currently at TRL5 but to be advanced to TRL7 at mission conclusion, can be accommodated in a single 3U CubeSat. The current plan is to launch from an International Space Station (ISS) orbit at ~400 km altitude and 52° inclination for low-cost validation over a ~90-day mission to fly in 2016. MiRaTA will demonstrate high fidelity, well-calibrated radiometric sensing from a nanosatellite platform, thereby enabling new architectural approaches for mission implementation at lower cost and risk with more flexible access to space.",

This paper investigates the resaturation processes of clay barrier, with emphasis on the coupling effects of heat and moisture during the intrusion of groundwater to the repository. A reference bentonite and a locally available clay were adopted in the laboratory program. Soil suction of clay specimens was measured by psychrometers embedded in clay specimens and by vapor equilibrium technique conducted at varying temperatures so as to determine the soil water characteristic curves of the two clays at different temperatures. And water uptake tests were conducted on clay specimens compacted at various densities to simulate the intrusion of groundwater into the clay barrier. Using the soil water characteristic curve, an integration scheme was introduced to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated clay. It was found that soil suction decreases as temperature increases, resulting in a reduction in water retention capability. The finite element method was then employed to carry out the numerical simulation of the saturation process in the near field of a repository. Results of the numerical simulation were validated using the degree of saturation profile obtained from the water uptake tests on the clays. The numerical scheme was then extended to establish a model simulating the resaturation process after the closure of a repository. Finally, the model was then used to evaluate the effect of clay barrier thickness on the time required for groundwater to penetrate the clay barrier and approach saturation. Due to the variation in clay suction and thermal conductivity with temperature of clay barrier material, the calculated temperature field shows a reduction as a result of incorporating the hydro-properties in the calculations.",

In 2013, PCC began experimenting with science discussion panels. The popularity of the science programming resulted in an expansion of the track for 2014, which Horodyskyj was responsible for coordinating. Thirty hours of programming were scheduled, including 25 discussion panels, NASA's FameLab, and a Mars room. Panelists included industry specialists, established scientists, STEM outreach enthusiasts, and early career scientists. The majority of the panelists were early career scientists recruited from planetary sciences and biology departments at ASU and UA. Panel topics included cosmology, biotechnology, artificial intelligence, space exploration, astrobiology, and the cross-linkages of each with pop culture. Formats consisted of Q&A, presentations, and interactive game shows. Although most panels were aimed at the general audience, some panels were more specialized.\nPCC 2014 attracted 77,818 attendees. The science programming received rave reviews from the audience, the PCC management, and the panelists themselves. Many panel rooms were filled to capacity and required crowd control to limit attendance. We observed the formation of science \"groupies\" who sought out the science panels exclusively and requested more information on other science public events in the Phoenix area. We distributed surveys to several select sessions to evaluate audience reasons for attending the science panels and their opinion of the scientists they observed. We will present the results of these surveys.\nAs the PCC continues to grow at an exponential rate, the science programming will continue to expand. We will discuss ideas for continued expansion of the PCC science programming both to serve the public and as a unique public outreach opportunity for early career scientists.",

            "abstract": "Models in the environmental sciences are repositories in a sense of the current state of understanding of critical processes. However, as our understanding of these processes (and their accompanying models) become more granular, the data requirements to parameterize them become more limiting. In addition, as these models become more useful, they are often pressed into service for decision support, meaning that they cannot accept the data latency typical of most environmental observations. Finally, the vast majority of environmental data is generated at highly-instrumented, infrastructure-rich “mega sites” in the US/Europe, while many of the most pressing environmental issues are in rural locales and in the developing world. Cellular-based environmental sensing is a promising means to provide granular data in real time from remote locales to improve model-based forecasting using data assimilation. Applications we are working on include drought forecasting and food security; forest and crop responses to weather and climate change; and rural water usage.\nOver the past two years, we have developed a suite of integrated hardware, firmware, and backend APIs that accommodates an unlimited variety of sensors, and propagates these data onto the internet over mobile networks. Scientific data holds a unique role for demanding well-characterized information on sensor error and our design attempts to balance error reduction with low costs. The result is a deployment system that undercuts competing commercial products by as much as 90%, allowing more ubiquitous deployment with lower risks associated with sensor loss. Enclosure design and power management are critical ingredients for remote deployments under variable environmental conditions. Sensors push data onto cloud storage and make this data available via public API’s via a backend server that accommodates additional metadata essential for interpreting observations, particularly their measurement errors. The data these pods collect can expand weather monitoring, but more crucially can monitor otherwise unobserved biological (including human) responses to environmental drivers. These data in turn can be assimilated into models, as a means to contextualize and distill these noisy observations into actionable knowledge.",

The Greenhouse Gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) is the first satellite dedicated to measure atmospheric CO2 concentrations from space. Even though many studies to develop the CO2 retrieval algorithms are performed, there have been serious limitations in spatial coverage and uncertainties due to aerosols and thin cirrus clouds. To reduce the errors due to aerosols and improve data availability, the CO2 retrieval algorithms combined with aerosol retrieval algorithm using Thermal And Near infrared Sensor for carbon Observation-Cloud and Aerosol Imager (TANSO-CAI) will be developed.\nIn this study, we describe our ongoing CO2 retrieval algorithms using shortwave infrared channels of GOSAT and the characteristics of retrieved CO2 concentration have been studied using the realistic simulations. Realistic simulations using the Vector LInearized pseudo-spherical Discrete ORdinate radiative Transfer (VLIDORT) have been carried out and the simulated retrieval errors of CO2 have been calculated for a range of values of surface type, surface pressure, solar zenith angle and aerosol loading under the assumption that the retrieval has converged to the correct answer.\nEspecially, this study focuses on sensitivity studies of various state vectors on simulated CO2 retrieval errors. The sensitivity study has shown that the assumptions about aerosol-related parameters, such as vertical distribution and types of aerosols, have the most influence on simulated CO2 retrieval errors. These results can provide useful information to estimate the effects of aerosols properties on CO2 retrieval algorithm.",

According to results, aerosol properties (AOD, profile, type) are most important error inducing parameter. Retrieval error induced by a priori error of other atmospheric factors, wavenumber dispersion and geometrical error usually does not exceed 2 ppm. However errors in aerosol properties can induce more than 2ppm of retrieval error. This result shows the importance of aerosol information in CO2 retrieval. To improve CO2 retrieval the aerosol retrieval algorithm using GOSAT-CAI measurements, which provide aerosol information for the same area with GOSAT-FTS measurements, is utilized. The strategy for dealing with this information is also introduced.",

            "abstract": "The East Asia region is the world's most populous area with a rapidly growing economy resulting in large air pollutant emissions. Asian mineral dust from Gobi Desert, Loess Plateau and barren mixed soil in Northern China and Mongolia has a major impact on the air quality in the Seoul Metropolitan Area. These mineral aerosols PM10 (particulate matter less than 10 um in diameter) concentration frequently exceeds the daily ambient air quality standards of 100μgm-3, and the number of exceedance days of daily PM10 reached about 40 times annually. The PM10 prediction by a regional chemical transport model without the dust emission shows an intrinsic tendency to underestimation according to previous studies in this region, especially for the soil originated coarse PM. This is partially due to the uncertainty of fugitive dust emissions.\nThis study is aim to improve dust model(ADAM2 – Asian Dust Aeorosol Model 2) by changing soil component over source regions using Harmonized World Soil Database. ADAM2 has four dust components of the Gobi Desert, sand dsert, Loess Plateau and barren mixed soil. The soil components, however, should be updated as current and detailed soil components. Therfore, we apply updated dust model with CTM(Chemical Transport Model), CMAQ(Community Multi-scale Air Quality Model) to simulate dust concentration over East Asia. It is found that dust concentration with updated dust model is better agreement with observation during dust event periods, compared with standard dust model.",

            "abstract": "It has been widely believed that Great Oxidation Event (GOE: Holland, 1994) occurred at ~2.4-2.2 Ga ago. However, some previous studies have found evidence for oxic ocean and atmosphere from earlier rock records (e.g., Hoashi et al., 2009). In order to explore if such oxic environment was local or global and if there was redox heterogeneity in a sedimentary basin before the inferred GOE, using the 2.7 Ga pyrite-bearing drillcore black shales (deep-facies WRL1 and shallow-facies RHDH2A drillcores) from Pilbara, Western Australia, we separately quantified abundance of S-bearing species (SAVS (acid-volatile sulfide), Spy (pyrite), SSO4 (sulfate), Sorg (organic-S), and S0 (elemental S) and Fe-bearing species (Fecarb, Feox, and Femag) by using sequential extraction methods. These samples were previously used by Brocks et al. (1999), Yamaguchi (2002), Yamaguchi et al. (2005), and Eigenbrode and Freeman (2006).\nThe shallow samples have high S contents and are interpreted to have deposited in relatively anoxic environment, but most of deep samples with elevated Fe contents deposited in relatively oxic environment. The DOP values and δ34Spy values are relatively higher in shallow samples, suggesting active bacterial sulfate reduction in reducing environment created due to near-complete consumption of dissolved O2by decomposition of organic matter produced by photosynthesizers living in the surface ocean.\nAll of these observations consistently suggest that the shallower part was anoxic and deeper part was oxic in the 2.7 Ga ocean. The surface ocean would have been oxygenated due to activity of oxygenic photosynthesis. Such redox stratification of the ocean, i.e., development of mid-depth (shallow) OMZ in an essentially oxic ocean, is typically seen in highly productive regions in the modern ocean. Modern-style oceanic redox structure could have existed as far back as 2.7 Ga ago, much earlier than the inferred GOE at ~2.4-2.2 Ga.\nBrocks et al.

The PSD sets were classified into 18 categories according to the relative magnitude of bias, variance ratio, and correlation coefficient, where each category had 11 sets with 50 samples. The ensemble methods used were as follows: equal weighted averaging with(out) bias correction (EWA_W(N)BC), weighted ensemble averaging based on root mean square errors and correlation (WEA_RAC), WEA based on the Taylor score (WEA_Tay), WEA based on reliability (WEA_REA), and multivariate linear regression (Mul_Reg). The weighted ensemble methods showed better projection skills in terms of accuracy and reliability than non-weighted methods, in particular, for the PSD categories having systematic biases and various correlation coefficients. In general, WEA_Tay, WEA_REA and WEA_RAC showed superior skills in terms of accuracy and reliability, regardless of the PSD categories, training periods, and ensemble numbers. The evaluation results showed that WEA_Tay and WEA_RAC are applicable even for simulation data with systematic biases, a short training period, and a small number of members. However, the EWA_NBC showed a comparable projection skill with the other methods only in the certain categories with unsystematic biases.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the statistical signature of deep-seated landslides using basin wide topographic data and flowpath arrangement and explore the extent to which these globally derived signatures can be used to locally map landslides. We used directed distance from the divide, which accounts for the distance traveled along flowpaths starting from significant ridgelines, as a scale parameter and demonstrate that local slope vs. directed distance and curvature vs. local slope offer powerful means for identifying the presence of landslides in a landscape. By exploring a threshold on the probability distribution of local slopes conditional on directed distance we show that mapping of landslide features is possible. We apply the methodology to three 0.5 to 2.5 km2 watersheds in northern California and document three regions of distinct geomorphic signatures [Gangodagamage et al., 2011, http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2010WR009252]. In region A, hillslope gradient increases with distance from the divide and flowpaths are divergent or parallel. Region B corresponds to the zone with highly convergent flowpaths and exhibits the strongest signal of landslide related features. Region C is a moderately convergent zone that transitions into the fluvial channel network. Next, we use specific quantiles of the probability density function of local slopes conditioned on directed distance from the divide to map individual landslide features. This analysis allows us to explore the 3D morphometry of the landslide affected basins and to develop a supervised set of ensemble templates for landslides as a function of local slope vs. directed distance (DD) relationship. Then we use this template and demonstrate that the landslide affected basins can be identified by iterative matching the landslide signature template with the basin wide signatures of the tributary basins in the South Fork Eel River, CA. Finally, we perform a multiscale analysis of the contributing area parameterized by directed distance from the divide and demonstrate that the landslide-disturbed landscapes show reduced complexity and degree of multifractality, that is, a reduction in the degree of spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of extreme contributing areas for a given distance from the divide.",

            "abstract": "Thermokarst lakes formed across vast regions of Siberia and Alaska during the last deglaciation and are thought to be a net source of atmospheric methane and carbon dioxide during the Holocene. However, the same thermokarst lakes can also sequester carbon, and it remains uncertain whether carbon uptake by thermokarst lakes can offset their greenhouse gas emissions. Here we use field observations of Siberian permafrost exposures, radiocarbon dating and spatial analyses to quantify Holocene carbon stocks and fluxes in lake sediments overlying thawed Pleistocene-aged permafrost. We find that carbon accumulation in deep thermokarst-lake sediments since the last deglaciation is about 1.6 times larger than the mass of Pleistocene-aged permafrost carbon released as greenhouse gases when the lakes first formed. While methane and carbon dioxide emissions following thaw lead to immediate radiative warming, carbon uptake in peat-rich sediments occurs over millennial time scales. With the help of an atmospheric perturbation model we assess thermokarst-lake carbon feedbacks to climate and find that thermokarst basins switched from a net radiative warming to a net cooling climate effect about 5000 years ago. High rates of Holocene carbon accumulation in lake sediments (47 ± 10 g C m-2 a-1, mean ± SE, n=20 lakes) were driven by thermokarst erosion and deposition of terrestrial organic matter, by nutrient release from thawing permafrost that stimulated lake productivity and by slow decomposition in cold, anoxic lake bottoms. When lakes eventually drained, permafrost formation rapidly sequestered sediment carbon. Our estimate of about 160 Pg of Holocene organic carbon in deep lake basins of Siberia and Alaska increases the circumpolar peat carbon pool estimate for permafrost regions by over 50 percent. The carbon in perennially-frozen drained lake sediments may become vulnerable to mineralization as permafrost disappears, potentially negating the climate stabilization provided by thermokarst lakes during the late Holocene.",

            "abstract": "Stomatal conductance (gs) is a key land surface attribute as it links transpiration, the dominant component of global land evapotranspiration and a key element of the global water cycle, and photosynthesis, the driving force of the global carbon cycle. Despite the pivotal role of gs in predictions of global water and carbon cycles, a global scale database and an associated globally applicable model of gs that allow predictions of stomatal behaviour are lacking. We present a unique database of globally distributed gs obtained in the field for a wide range of plant functional types (PFTs) and biomes. We employed a model of optimal stomatal conductance to assess differences in stomatal behaviour, and estimated the model slope coefficient, g1, which is directly related to the marginal carbon cost of water, for each dataset. We found that g1 varies considerably among PFTs, with evergreen savanna trees having the largest g1 (least conservative water use), followed by C3 grasses and crops, angiosperm trees, gymnosperm trees, and C4 grasses. Amongst angiosperm trees, species with higher wood density had a higher marginal carbon cost of water, as predicted by the theory underpinning the optimal stomatal model. There was an interactive effect between temperature and moisture availability on g1: for wet environments, g1 was largest in high temperature environments, indicated by high mean annual temperature during the period when temperature above 0oC (Tm), but it did not vary with Tm across dry environments. We examine whether these differences in leaf-scale behaviour are reflected in ecosystem-scale differences in water-use efficiency. These findings provide a robust theoretical framework for understanding and predicting the behaviour of stomatal conductance across biomes and across PFTs that can be applied to regional, continental and global-scale modelling of productivity and ecohydrological processes in a future changing climate.",

Several actions at national, regional and global scale have been adopted to reduce pollutant emission levels. In our work we make use of the EDGAR_ v4.3 emission database to compare today’s pollutant levels with ex-post scenarios developed to assess the impact and effectiveness of legislation over the last 3 decades on air quality and climate. Differently from most of literature works addressing future air quality, here we focus on historical global anthropogenic emissions (years 1970-2010) of several gaseous and particulate air pollutants (SO2, NOx, CO, NMVOC, NH3, PM10, PM2.5, BC and OC) and past emission scenarios to demonstrate the role that policy has played in improving air quality. Three scenarios have been developed and compared to today’s situation (year 2010), assuming the lack of abatement measures, the complete stagnation of technology (no reduction measures applied and constant emission factors from 1970), and a constant fuel mixture (with a more prominent role for coal in the 1970s).\nSpecial focus is dedicated to the power generation sector, manufacturing industry and road transport activities since these were mostly influenced by official regulations in the EU. Global SO2 emissions from transport dropped down by 8.5 times due to the deployment of low S content fuels; NOx and CO emissions are indeed a function of combustion efficiency and therefore decreased with the introduction of new technologies, while NH3 emitted by road transport increased in Europe by 18% due to the introduction of catalyzers. Finally, particulate matter emissions are mainly abated by the installation of End-of-Pipe measures (e.g. filters) especially in the energy and transport sectors.",

Atmosphereless planetary bodies, e.g., planetary satellites, asteroids, or Kuiper belt objects are enshrouded in clouds of dust released by meteoroid impacts or by volcanism. The ejecta grains are samples from the surface of these objects and their analysis can be performed from orbit or flyby to determine the surface composition, interior structure and ongoing geochemical processes. Early dust mass spectrometers on the Halley missions had sufficient mass resolution in order to provide important cosmochemical information in the near-comet high dust flux environment. The Ulysses dust detector discovered interstellar grains within the planetary system (Gruen et al. A&A, 1994) and its twin detector on Galileo discovered the tenuous dust clouds around the Galilean satellites (Krueger et al., Icarus, 2003). The similar-sized Cosmic Dust Analyzer onboard the Cassini mission combined a highly sensitive dust detector with a low-mass resolution mass spectrometer. Compositional dust measurements from this instrument probed the deep interior of Saturn's Enceladus satellite (Postberg et al., Nature, 2009). Based on this experience new instrumentation was developed that combined the best attributes of all these predecessors and exceeded their capabilities in accurate trajectory determination. The Hyperdust instrument is a combination of a Dust Trajectory Sensor (DTS) together with an analyzer for the chemical composition of dust particles in space. Dust particles' trajectories are determined by the measurement of induced electric signals. Large area chemical analyzers of 0.1 m2 sensitive area have been tested at a dust accelerator and it was demonstrated that they have sufficient mass resolution to resolve ions with atomic mass number >100. The Hyperdust instrument is capable of distinguishing interstellar and interplanetary grains based on their trajectory composition information. In orbit or flyby near airless planetary bodies the instrument can map the surface compositional down to a spatial resolution of ~10 km. The Hyperdust instrument is currently being developed to TRL 6 funded by NASA’s MatISSE program to be a low-mass, high performance instrument for future in-situ exploration.",

            "abstract": "The Japan Sea, which is a backarc basin between Japanese island arc and the Asian continent, has a unique setting in terms of a formation process as well as a seismogenic process. The opening of the Japan Sea was initiated by crustal rifting and the separation of Japan Island Arcs from the Asian continent in the early Oligocene (~ 32 Ma), with subsequent ocean floor spreading in the late Oligocene (~ 28 Ma). Then, the opening stopped, between 10 and 3.5 Ma, and at 3.5 Ma, the crustal shortening occurred under a strong compressional stress regime in the eastern margin of the Japan Sea. Several seismic surveys had been conducted in this region since the last more than two decades, however, a conclusive discussion concerning a crustal construction in the arc-backarc transition zone had not been made, due to lack of resolution of structural models and sparse distribution of profiles. Moreover, magnitude-7 class earthquakes repeatedly occurred along this margin, such as, the 1964 Niigata earthquake (M7.5), 1983 Nihonkai–Chubu earthquake (M7.7), 1993 Hokkaido Nansei-oki earthquake (M7.8), and those events are recognized to have compressional fault mechanisms by reflecting a present-day stress regime. However, structural factor controlling the distribution and mechanism of those compressional events has not been well studied. In order to understand a crustal formation process in this margin and its relation to the seismogenic process at the present, we have been carrying our series of active-source seismic survey to cover the eastern margin of the central to northern Japan Sea. Results from those surveys successfully mapped a distribution of the arc crust, the oceanic crust and the amorously thick oceanic crust in the transition zone. From a comparison the rupture zones of the magnitude-7 class earthquake with the detailed crustal structure, we conclude that the large compressional events, more than M>7.5, occurred in a seismogenic zone fault which used to be formed a structural boundary between the arc crust and the thick oceanic crust. This structural boundary (i.e., seismogenic fault at the present) is clearly recognized in seismic sections as a landward dipping reflector.",

            "abstract": "Unit cell parameters of a series of synthetic garnets with the pyrope, grossular, and four intermediate compositions were measured up to about 900K and to 10 GPa using synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction. Coefficients of thermal expansion of pyrope-grossular garnets are in the range 2.10~ 2.74 x 10-5 K-1 and uniformly increase with temperature. Values for the two end members pyrope and grossular are identical within experimental error 2.74±0.05 x 10-5 K-1 and 2.73±0.01 x 10-5 K-1 respectively. Coefficients of thermal expansion for intermediate compositions are smaller than those of end members, and are not linearly dependent on composition. Bulk modulus of grossular is Κ0=164.3(1) GPa (with Κ0’ the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus fixed to 5.92) and bulk modulus of pyrope is Κ0=169.2(2) GPa (with Κ0’ fixed to 4.4) using a third order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state, which are consistent with previously reported values. The bulk moduli of garnets of intermediate composition are between ~155 and ~160 GPa, smaller than those of the end-members no matter which Κ0’ is chosen. The compositional dependence of bulk modulus resembles the compositional dependence of thermal expansion. Intermediate garnets on this binary have large positive excess volume, which makes them more compressible. We find that excess volumes in the pyrope-grossular series remain relatively large even at high pressure (~6GPa) and temperature (~800K), supporting the observation of crystal exsolution on this garnet join.

            "abstract": "The characteristic earthquake hypothesis is the basis of time-dependent modeling of earthquake recurrence on major faults, using the renewal process methodology. However, the characteristic earthquake hypothesis is not strongly supported by observational data. Few fault segments have long historical or paleoseismic records of individually dated ruptures, and when data and parameter uncertainties are allowed for, the form of the recurrence-distribution is difficult to establish. This is the case, for instance, of the Corinth gulf fault system, for which documents about strong earthquakes exist for at least two thousand years, but they can be considered complete for magnitudes > 6.0 only for the latest 300 years, during which only few characteristic earthquakes are reported for single fault segments.\nThe use of a physics-based earthquake simulator has allowed the production of catalogs lasting 100,000 years and containing more than 500,000 events of magnitudes > 4.0. The main features of our simulation algorithm are (1) the imposition of an average slip rate released by earthquakes to every single segment recognized in the investigated fault system, (2) the interaction between earthquake sources, (3) a self-organized earthquake magnitude distribution, and (4) the effect of minor earthquakes in redistributing stress.\nThe application of our simulation algorithm to the Corinth gulf fault system has shown realistic features in time, space and magnitude behavior of the seismicity. These features include long-term periodicity of strong earthquakes, short-term clustering of both strong and smaller events, and a realistic earthquake magnitude distribution departing from the Gutenberg-Richter distribution in the higher magnitude range.",

Recently it has been studied that the plasma and neutral densities in the thermosphere and ionosphere show periodic oscillations with respect to the solar wind speed and Kp index during the declining phase of the solar cycle. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the electron density and the solar wind speed during the declining phase of the solar cycle using the observation from the Detection of Electro-Magnetic Emissions Transmitted from Earthquake Regions (DEMETER) satellite at the altitude of 660 km. The electron density near the dip equator tends to increase with the solar wind speed from January to April, but there is no clear tendency in the other times. Also, the electron density shows good relationship with the solar wind speed at the magnetic longitudes from 240 to 300 degrees. However, there is poor relationship in the other longitudes. We will discuss the seasonal and longitudinal dependences of the electron density on the solar wind speed in the low and middle latitude ionosphere.",

            "abstract": "The role of meridional flow in maintaining the solar dynamo and differential rotation in the solar convection zone is not well understood and is currently under scrutiny. The traditional flux-transport dynamo models have posited the well known single-cell meridional flow with poleward flow at the photosphere and equatorward flow near the base of the convection zone. However, recent investigations seem to be revealing a different picture of meridional flow which is double celled in the radial direction with poleward flow at the photosphere and equatorward flow at a much shallower level in the convection zone. In this work time-distance helioseismology is used to probe the solar convection zone to accurately determine the structure of meridional circulation.\nHelioseismology uses the photospherically visible aspect of (acoustic, surface-gravity) waves, that propagate and interfere throughout the Sun to form standing oscillation modes, as probes to make inferences about the structure and flows on the solar surface and interior. Time-distance helioseismology is based on measuring the travel-times of wave-packets moving between distinct points on the solar surface. Travel-time shifts obtained by calculating the difference in the travel-times of counter-propagating waves between the same points on the solar surface yield information about flows throughout the solar convection zone. In this work time-distance techniques are applied on artificial and solar Doppler velocity images to detect travel-time shifts due to meridional flow. Modifications are suggested to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of travel-time shift measurements. The artificial data is constructed by embedding various meridional flow models in 3D acoustic simulators, which is then used to discuss the interpretation of travel-time shifts, so that in the future an inversion procedure may be designed to calculate meridional flow velocities with greater accuracy. The solar data is obtained from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) spacecraft and is used to measure travel-time shifts due to meridional flow. The issue of a systematic error dubbed as the ‘center-to-limb effect’ that contaminates the travel-time shift measurements of solar meridional flow is also addressed in this work.",

            "abstract": "Since 1900, around 90,000 people have lost their lives in 76 earthquakes occurred in Turkey, with a total affected population of ~7 million and direct estimated losses of ~25 billion USD. About half the lives lost were due to two earthquakes associated with the North Anatolian Fault in 1939 and 1999. During this time, seven large westward-migrating earthquakes created a 900-km-long continuous surface rupture along the fault zone from Erzincan to the Marmara Sea, stopping just short of Istanbul. Based on a time-dependent model that includes coseismic and postseismic effects of the 1999 Kocaeli earthquake with moment magnitude (Mw) = 7.4, Parsons concluded that the probability of an earthquake with Mw >7 in the Sea of Marmara near Istanbul is 35% to 70% in the next 30 years. This high probability is shared by Tokyo and San Francisco; however, the earthquake fragility of the pre-2000 building stock in Turkey is much higher than that of California or Japan. (Erdik, 2013). All of the arguments described above provide a sound basis for a Japanese-Turkish partnership enabling each partner to share experiences gained from past destructive earthquakes and prepare for expected large earthquakes. The SATREPS project aims to address this need, also focusing on the tsunami hazard. The project’s main objectives are i) to develop disaster mitigation policies and strategies based on multidisciplinary research activities; ii) to provide decision makers with newly found knowledge for its implementation to the current regulations; iii) to organize disaster education programs in order to increase disaster awareness in Turkey; iv) to contribute the evaluation of active fault studies in Japan. To achieve successfully these objectives, 4 research groups have been set specializing on observations, simulations, civil engineering and disaster education and the results will be integrated for disaster mitigation in the Marmara region and disaster education in Turkey.",

            "abstract": "Long-range transport of black carbon (BC) aerosols to the Pacific Ocean can potentially play a significant role in changing the marine climate through influences on temperature and cloud profiles and the top-of-atmosphere and surface energy balance. Therefore, quantitatively understanding sources of BC over the Pacific, particularly at different altitudes, is of great importance. In this study, we simulate the transport of thirteen continental BC tracers with a variety of e-folding aging times (few hours to 1 month) using the global chemical transport model MOZART-4. We then optimize BC aging rate according to different source regions by constraining the vertical profile of BC concentrations to the HAIPER Polo-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO). We find that for all HIPPO deployments, a shorter BC aging timescale (less than half day) for tropical and mid-latitude tracers and a longer aging timescale (2-10 days) for high-latitude tracers (except summer) in most cases significantly reduces model biases. By comparing the source-receptor relationship between the optimized BC tracers over the Pacific, we find that during 2009-2011, East Asia contributes most to the BC loading over the Northern Pacific in all seasons except summer, while South American, African and Australian tracers dominate the BC loadings over the Southern Pacific. In addition, unlike other tracers, African BC is a dominant contributor over a larger area in the free troposphere versus the boundary layer. Our findings indicate that the aging rate of BC strongly depends on source location and season, which may significantly influence the contribution of different source regions to BC forcing over the Pacific Ocean.",

            "abstract": "Xenon in Earth's atmosphere is severely mass fractionated and depleted compared to any plausible solar system source material, yet Kr is unfractionated. These observations seem to imply that Xe has escaped from Earth. Vigorous hydrodynamic hydrogen escape can produce mass fractionation in heavy gases. The required hydrogen flux is very high but within the range permitted by solar EUV heating when Earth was 100 Myrs old or younger. However this model cannot explain why Xe escapes but Kr does not.\nRecently, what appears to be ancient atmospheric xenon has been recovered from several very ancient (3-3.5 Ga) terrestrial hydrothermal barites and cherts (Pujol 2011, 2013). What is eye-catching about this ancient Xe is that it is less fractionated that Xe in modern air. In other words, it appears that a process was active on Earth some 3 to 3.5 billion years ago that caused xenon to fractionate. By this time the Sun was no longer the EUV source that it used to be. If xenon was being fractionated by escape — currently the only viable hypothesis — it had to be in Earth’s Archean atmosphere and under rather modest levels of EUV forcing.\nIt should be possible for Xe, but not Kr, to escape from Earth as an ion. In a hydrodynamically escaping hydrogen wind the hydrogen is partially ionized. The key concepts are that ions are much more strongly coupled to the escaping flow than are neutrals (so that a relatively modest flow of H and H+ to space could carry Xe+ along with it, the flux can be small enough to be consistent with diffusion-limited flux), and that Xe alone among the noble gases is more easily ionized than hydrogen. This sort of escape is possible along the polar field lines, although a weak or absent magnetic field would likely work as well. The extended history of hydrogen escape implicit in Xe escape in the Archean is consistent with other suggestions that hydrogen escape in the Archean was considerable. Hydrogen escape plausibly played the key role in creating oxidizing conditions at the surface of the Earth and setting the stage for the creation of an O2 atmosphere (Urey 1951, Catling et al 2001, Zahnle et al 2013).

            "abstract": "Rise of atmospheric oxygen in the Paleoproterozoic has been long recognized as a unidirectional, stepwise oxidation event. However, recent geochemical studies have reported the occurrences of deep-water oxygenation and sulfate accumulation in the Paleoproterozoic oceans [e.g., 1], suggesting that the oxidation was a dynamic transition associated with an overshoot of oxygen (so called, ‘the Great Oxygen Transition’ or GOT) [2]. During the GOT, the oxygen levels might have achieved 0.1-1 Present Atmospheric Level (PAL) over ~108 years [2]. Such an intense long-term oxygen overshoot appears to require some specific mechanism and strong oxidative forcing as a trigger. In this study, we provide the first numerical model that is capable of explaining the dynamics of the atmospheric oxygen during the GOT. We focus on a climate jump at the end of the Paleoproterozoic snowball glaciation as a trigger, and constrain the magnitude and duration of the snowball-induced oxygenation by using a biogeochemical cycle model.\nThe results show that super greenhouse condition after the glaciation causes an increase in nutrient input from the continent to the oceans, which lead to a high rate of organic carbon burial in the oceans. This triggers a rapid jump in oxygen levels from low (<10-5 PAL) to high (~0.01 PAL) steady states within <104 years after deglaciation. The jump in oxygen levels is followed by the massive deposition of carbonate minerals, which corresponds to the “cap-carbonates”. The elevated rate of organic carbon burial is prolonged over ~106 years, which results in an overshoot of atmospheric oxygen by up to ~0.1-1 PAL. The overshoot lasts for ~107-108 years because net consumption of oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere does not proceed efficiently. Such an extensive overshoot causes the oxygenation of the deep-water, and lead to the accumulation of sulfate ions by up to 1-10 mM and the deposition of sulfate minerals in the oceans. These results are in good agreement with the geological and geochemical data in the Paleoproterozoic [2, 3], implying that the Paleoproterozoic snowball glaciation would have been a sufficiently strong forcing to trigger the GOT.\n[1] Canfield et al. 2013, Pros.

The urban canopy model (UCM) parameterizations coupled to the WRF model were used to study urban processes, and their effect on the diurnal evolution of boundary layer structure in urban building environments. The study domain for modeling is the Seoul metropolitan area, which is typical urban building environment with high-densities and a broad range of multi-stories buildings. To create and compare urban land surface, the land cover was extracted from the Environmental Geographic Information System and the spatial data of the Seoul Metropolitan area for the Biotope Mapping Project. To apply UCM parameterization, the classification of urban surfaces was conducted. For the analysis, several meteorological variables were used during two specific time periods, i.e., day and night. Overall, large differences in wind fields were shown distinctly by urbanization effect. However, the magnitude of the differences was distinguished between the time periods. The differences in the wind components by urbanization effect were somewhat stronger during the day than at night, and it was likely that the marked decrease in the wind speed during the day was mainly caused by increased mechanical drag, turbulence production, and thermal effects. The urbanization effect showed a decrease of wind speed in the urban canopy layer for two specific times. Moreover, the urbanization effect on the simulation of wind fields was applied to air quality studies in urban building environments.\nAcknowledgements: This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (NRF-2010-0012045).",

            "abstract": "The shallow groundwater flow system of White Sands dune field, located within the arid to semi-arid Tularosa Basin of Southern New Mexico, likely stabilizes the base of the largest gypsum dune field in the world. The dune is saturated throughout nearly its entire accumulation thickness, resulting in a shallow water table (< 3 ft bgs) in the inter-dunal areas. Water table elevation influences the spatial extent of the dune field and accumulation thickness. The White Sands National Monument (WHSA) is concerned that lowering the water table may lead to increased scour and migration of the dune field, which could be unfavorable to the preservation of the flora and fauna that have adapted to survive there. In response to projected increases in groundwater pumping in the regional Tularosa Basin groundwater system, changes in surface water use, and the threat of climate change, the WHSA is interested in understanding how these changes on a regional scale may impact the shallow dune field aquifer.\nMathematical modeling techniques on varying spatial and temporal scales are used to characterize the relative importance of the sources of water (local vs. regional) to the dune aquifer, and to quantify the timescales on which changes may affect the water table in the dune field. A 2-dimensional, dune-scale heat and fluid flow model uses the seasonal temperature fluctuations to estimate the vertical and horizontal flow of water from the regional system to the dune field aquifer. We have also constructed a 2-dimensional, hydrologic model to characterize the regional groundwater flow regime near to the dune aquifer system, as well as across the Tularosa Basin to a depth of 6 km. Additionally, a 3-dimensional, hydrologic model of the Tularosa Basin and the White Sands dune field quantifies hydrologic characteristics, sources and sinks of groundwater in the basin and at the dune field. Computed and observed salinity, groundwater residence times, and water level data are the primary means of model calibration. Preliminary results from the three models indicate the regional groundwater system does contribute flow to the dune aquifer, and that increased pumping may increase drawdown of the regional groundwater system near the dune field. These results indicate the dune is sensitive to regional hydrologic changes.",

Data in respect of eight strong El-Nino zero years (1965, 1972, 1982, 1987, 1994, 1997, 2004 and 2009) have been composited for the September – November seasons and their previous years (El-Nino -1 years namely 1964, 1971, 1981, 1986, 1993, 1996, 2003 and 2008) for the same season. During the September – November season of the El-Nino previous years, the warmest equatorial area of Indian Ocean is its eastern part between longitudes 90ºE and 100ºE in the top 50m of the ocean. During September – November of the El-Nino zero years, the warmest area has shifted westward and the western Indian Ocean has warmed through more than 1ºC in a deep layer. In contrast, the eastern Indian Ocean has cooled slightly. Thus the effect of an El-Nino is to induce a positive IOD signal in temperature in the Indian Ocean. The atmospheric surface wind field changes during this period have been analyzed to understand the dynamics of ocean-atmosphere coupling that has resulted in these temperature changes in the Indian Ocean.",

            "abstract": "The audience for sea ice data sets has broadened dramatically over the past several decades. Initially the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) sea ice products were used primarily by sea ice specialists. However, now they are in demand by researchers in many different domains and some are used by the public. This growth in the number and type of users has presented challenges to content providers aimed particularly at supporting interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary data use.\nIn our experience, it is generally insufficient to simply make the data available as originally formatted. New audiences typically need data in different forms; forms that meet their needs, that work with their specific tools. Moreover, simple data reformatting is rarely enough. The data needs to be aggregated, transformed or otherwise converted into forms that better serve the needs of the new audience.\nThe Semantic Sea Ice Interoperability Initiative (SSIII) is an NSF-funded research project aimed at making sea ice data more useful to more people using semantic technologies. The team includes domain and science data experts as well as knowledge representation and linked data experts. Beginning with a series of workshops involving members of the operations, sea ice research and modeling communities, as well as members of local communities in Alaska, a suite of ontologies describing the physical characteristics of sea ice have been developed and used to provide one of NSIDC’s data sets, the operational Arctic sea ice charts obtained from the Canadian Ice Center, as open-linked data. These data extend nearly a decade into the past and can now be queried either directly through a publicly available SPARQL end point (for those who are familiar with open-linked data) or through a simple Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards map-based query tool. Questions like “What were the characteristics (i.e., sea ice concentration, form and stage of development) of the sea ice in the region surrounding my ship/polar bear on date X?” can now be answered.\nThis service may be of interest within the broad polar community – especially those who already are familiar with either open-linked data or OGC services. We seek feedback, collaborators, and users.",

            "abstract": "Analog studies help to understand the processes that might sustain any habitable environments on Mars and the attributes of organisms that might have inhabited them. These studies must consider key differences between Mars and Earth, for example, the ways that tectonics, impacts, hydrologic cycles, and aeolian processes have interacted to shape climate, the conditions in the near subsurface, and the processes that can preserve any evidence of any past habitable environments and life. Key questions include the following: How can we characterize Martian geochemical cycles of biogenic elements? What is the minimum chemical water activity of Mars-relevant aqueous solutions that might sustain the propagation by life as we know it? Can life persist inside rocks that have been altered isochemically at relatively low water/rock values? What are the minimum combinations of free energy and power needed to sustain life in Mars-relevant environments? Given the pervasive harsh conditions at the Martian surface, where and how can we seek evidence of any extant life? What kinds of nonbiological features that mimic biosignatures might be produced in potentially habitable Martian environments? Which methods can most effectively resolve Earthly contamination from potential Martian biosignatures in situ? What biosignatures might be produced by subsurface life and how can they be distinguished from abiotic features? How might we recognize evidence of any “life as we DON’T know it?” For future landing site selection, how can remotely sensed features be related more effectively to key attributes of habitable environments such as past availability and persistence of water, potential sources of biochemical energy, and favorable environmental conditions? Which Martian processes and environments are most favorable for preservation of evidence of any past environments and biosignatures? How can deposits that might be favorable for preservation be found and characterized from orbit? How can we assess radiation hazards for the preservation of biosignatures in order to guide sample selection during landed missions? The need to understand such issues in a Martian context should influence the design and implementation of analog studies.",

            "abstract": "Networked high frequency hydrologic and water quality measurements needed to investigate physical and biogeochemical processes at the watershed scale and create robust models are limited and lacking standardization. Determining the drivers and mechanisms of ecological changes in aquatic systems in response to natural and anthropogenic pressures is challenging due to the large amounts of terrestrial, aquatic, atmospheric, biological, chemical, and physical data it requires at varied spatiotemporal scales. The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is a continental-scale infrastructure project designed to provide data to address the impacts of climate change, land-use, and invasive species on ecosystem structure and function. Using a combination of standardized continuous in situ measurements and observational sampling, the NEON Aquatic array will produce over 200 data products across its spatially-distributed field sites for 30 years to facilitate spatiotemporal analysis of the drivers of ecosystem change. Three NEON sites in Alabama were chosen to address linkages between watershed-scale processes and ecosystem changes along an eco-hydrological gradient within the Tombigbee River Basin. The NEON Aquatic design, once deployed, will include continuous measurements of surface water physical, chemical, and biological parameters, groundwater level, temperature and conductivity and local meteorology. Observational sampling will include bathymetry, water chemistry and isotopes, and a suite of organismal sampling from microbes to macroinvertebrates to vertebrates. NEON deployed a buoy to measure the temperature profile of the Black Warrior River from July – November, 2013 to determine the spatiotemporal variability across the water column from a daily to seasonal scale. In July 2014 a series of water quality profiles were performed to assess the contribution of physical and biogeochemical drivers over a diurnal cycle. Additional river transects were performed across our site reach to capture the spatial variability of surface water parameters. Our preliminary data show differing response times to precipitation events and diurnal processes informing our infrastructure designs and sampling protocols aimed at providing data to address the eco-hydrological gradient.",

            "abstract": "The late Quaternary history of the Red Sea is characterized by sharp increases in sea surface salinity during glacial maxima in response to global sea level drop. These imposed an extremely weak current exchange between the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean through the Bab-el-Mandeb Straits that resulted in temporal changes in stratification, productivity and subsurface oxygenation of the Red Sea. The combined effect of these perturbations has been interpreted to impose extended aplanktonic zones in Red Sea sediments centered at glacial maxima. Yet the dynamics of the transition between glacial and interglacial stages in the Red Sea are still not well understood.\nHere, we present evidence for the occurrence of a strong anoxic episode during the penultimate transition from Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6 to MIS5 (Termination II) based on uranium concentrations, isotopic ratios, and organic carbon concentrations (Corg) studied in core KL23 taken by R/V Meteor from northern Red Sea (24o44.88’N 35o03.28’E) at 702 m water depth.\n(234U/238U) activity ratios and U concentrations start rising from their MIS6 levels (~1 and 1.9 ppm, respectively) ca. 140 ka, and peak at 135-132 ka (1.08 and 3.1 ppm). These patterns are matched by changes in Corg, and the onset of all slightly precedes sea level rise patterns. Thereafter, uranium and Corg decrease sharply, reaching minima that characterizes the rest of MIS5e, ca. 130 ka. Uranium activity ratios however, decrease gradually from their deglacial peak to a minimum value (~0.94) at 122 ka. In view of the redox sensitive behavior of U, the buildup of U concentrations would support anoxic conditions, rather than a rise in export production, as the most likely explanation for the preservation of Corg in the sediments. Yet, the high (234U/238U) values that imply a dominance of open seawater U in the samples, together with d13C values of foraminifera bracketing the studied interval that display a depletion trend indicating an increase in primary production, both suggest that an increase in export production cannot be ruled out as the source of high Corg in the sediments. We will evaluate the possibility of an increase in export production that is coeval with the aplanktonic zone in this core in the context of 230Th excess data, sea level changes and paleo-circulation of the Red Sea.",

Because ground based measurements are required to validate ozone products from GEMS, we consider to use PANDORA instrument based on the DOAS method, which can provide hourly total column ozone (TCO) measurements even in the presence of aerosols and clouds.\nThis study is to examine the performance of TCO from PANDORA, which was installed in Busan and Seoul, by comparing with TCO from Brewer, Dobson, and OMI from March 2012 to December 2013. PANDORA TCO showed a high correlation of 0.99 with a negative bias of 2-3% relative to Brewer and Dobson TCO. However, the correlation between PANDORA and OMI TCO was lower than that between Brewer and OMI TCO. We found that Brewer didn’t provide TCO in the presence of clouds. However, even though PANDORA measurements were filtered out during thick cloudy condition, the PANDORA still showed unusual high ozone during thin cloudy condition. In order to have continuous PANDORA measurements for comparison with hourly GEMS measurements, the PANDORA measurements under thin cloudy condition are required to be corrected. We have performed the correction of PANDORA observations using Kalman filter which is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational solution of the least-squares method. When we applied this approach, the result showed the improvement in correlation between PANDORA and OMI TCO as much as that between Brewer and OMI TCO.",

            "abstract": "As the role of carbon emissions from inland waters in regional and global carbon budget has become increasing apparent, better understanding the influence of environmental variables on CO2 exchange requires direct, long-term eddy covariance measurements of CO2 fluxes across the water-atmosphere interface. Here we provide analysis of CO2 fluxes over a large southern inland water body of Ross Barnett Reservoir in central Mississippi in 2008. It is found that greater atmospheric instability at night leads to approximately 70% greater CO2 effluxes than during daytime. Frequent synoptic weather events associated with extratropical cyclones induce CO2 flux pulses, resulting in further increase in annual CO2 effluxes by 16%. Therefore, our measurements indicate that CO2 emission rates from global inland waters, which do not account for the influence of these atmospheric physical processes on CO2 exchange across the water-air interface, are likely underestimated by approximately 42%. Field measurements and modeling efforts to estimate CO2 emissions should consider this daytime-nighttime efflux difference and the missing emissions during these synoptic weather events.",

In the present study we assume a steady radial expansion in a Parker spiral interplanetary magnetic field and anisotropic electron velocity distribution functions. The empirical energization rates are consequently derived for both the slow and fast solar wind streams using fits of power law radial profiles to observed macroscopic electron characteristics (i.e. density, temperature and heat flux). Our results indicate that compared to protons no external heating mechanisms are required in case of solar wind electrons and the observed temperature radial gradients are simply explained by the adiabatic cooling, internal electron heat flux and energy exchange provided by electron-electron Coulomb collisions. While the energization rate in the fast solar wind is found more or less equal to zero, it is even negative in the slow wind representing thus a source of a free energy.",

            "abstract": "Sedimentary deposits in Pliocene extensional rift basins in the Afar Depression, Ethiopia chronicle the evolution and paleoenvironmental context of early humans. In the lower Awash Valley, the long-studied Hadar Basin still lacks constraints on basin development during the onset and termination of Hadar Formation (~3.8 – 2.94 Ma) sedimentation. Here we present new mapping and analysis of tephra deposits from a 26 meter-thick section of sediments exposed in the central Ledi-Geraru project area at Gulfaytu, including 20 m of sediments and tephras conformably overlying a 2.94 Ma tephra marker bed (BKT-2U) that previously served as the uppermost dated tephra of the Hadar Formation. Within the overlying 20 meters of primarily lacustrine strata, we identified eight post-BKT-2U tuffs; four were suitable for geochemical characterization, and one yielded an 40Ar/39Ar age of 2.931 ± 0.034 Ma. Based on regional sedimentation rates and the tephra 40Ar/39Ar age, we infer that the newly mapped Hadar Formation at Gulfaytu represents ca. 20 kyr of post-BKT-2 sedimentation. An erosional surface marked by a conglomerate truncates the strata at Gulfaytu, and shows similarities to the well-documented Busidima unconformity surface to the southwest, suggesting that structural changes after 2.93 Ma also affected basin conditions in central Ledi-Geraru. Furthermore, subsurface geophysical investigations support a model whereby deposition rates and the stratigraphic thickness of paleo-Lake Hadar sediments are greatest in the central Ledi-Geraru, ~20 km northeast of the well-exposed lacustrine-dominated sediments of the Hadar Formation. In addition to preserving a record of post-BKT-2 strata, the central Ledi Geraru hosts the thickest subsurface lacustrine sedimentary record within the Hadar Basin hitherto described, making central Ledi-Geraru an ideal location for collecting a continuous core by the Hominin Sites and Paleolakes Drilling Project (HSPDP).",

Here we present downcore analyses of coccolith assemblages used to assess temporal and spatial changes in surface-water conditions, coccolith production and paleoproductivity during the Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 16-11. Absolute assemblage counts are used to quantify the CaCO3 contribution of the coccoliths to the total carbonate accumulation. The Highest Occurrence (HO) of Gephyrocapsa omega within MIS 15, the HO of Pseudoemiliania lacunosa at MIS 12, and the occurrence of Helicosphaera inversa within MIS 11 are considered as biostratigraphic constraints in the examined interval. Total coccolithophore abundance displays considerable changes and highlights an important increase in values from MIS 15 to MIS 11. This variation, is concurrent with a relevant change in the assemblage composition, represented by the beginning of the medium-sized Gephyrocapsa (3-4 μm) dominance interval (mainly Gephyrocapsa caribbeanica) during the mid-Brunhes interval. Small gephyrocapsids (< 3 μm) dominate through MIS 16-15, while G. caribbeanica (> 3 μm) becomes the most important species from MIS 15 to MIS 11. During MIS 13, coccolithophore abundance reaches maximum values and high frequency variability. From MIS 13 to MIS 11 the pattern of coccolithophore production distinctly reflects glacial/interglacial cycles, with higher values during the interglacials. A cumulative curve of warm water taxa was obtained for the studied interval, and it shows high amplitude fluctuations during interglacial periods. The results represent a good coccolithophore dataset for the comprehension of climate and paleoceanographic patterns through the mid Pleistocene and the mid-Brunhes interval.",

            "abstract": "Crystal-poor rhyodacitic to rhyolitic volcanic eruptions at Laguna del Maule volcanic complex, Chile have produced an astonishing range of textural variation to pyroclasts. Here, we focus on eruptive deposits from two Quaternary eruptions from vents on the northwestern side of the Laguna del Maule basin: the rhyolite of Loma de Los Espejos and the rhyodacite of Laguna Sin Puerto.\nClasts in the pyroclastic fall and pyroclastic flow deposits from the rhyolite of Loma de Los Espejos range from dense, non-vesicular (obsidian) to highly vesicular, frothy (coarsely vesicular reticulite); where vesicularity varies from <1% to >90%. Bulk compositions range from 75.6-76.7 wt.% SiO2. The highest vesicularity clasts are found in early fall deposits and widely dispersed pyroclastic flow deposits; the frothy carapace to lava flows is similarly highly vesicular. Pyroclastic deposits also contain tube pumice, and macroscopically folded, finely vesicular, breadcrusted, and heterogeneously vesiculated textures. We speculate that preservation of the highest vesicularities requires relatively low decompression rates or open system degassing such that relaxation times were sufficient to allow extensive vesiculation. Such an inference is in apparent contradiction to documentation of Plinian dispersal to the eruption.\nClasts in the pyroclastic fall deposit of the rhyodacite (68-72 wt.% SiO2) of Laguna Sin Puerto are finely vesicular, with vesicularity modes at ~50% and ~68% corresponding to gray and white pumice colors, respectively. Some clasts are banded in color (and vesicularity). All clasts were fragmented into highly angular particles, with subplanar to slightly concave exterior surfaces (average Wadell Roundness of clast margins between 0.32 and 0.39), indicating brittle fragmentation. In contrast to Loma de Los Espejos, high bubble number densities to Laguna Sin Puerto rhyodacite imply high decompression rates.",

            "abstract": "A joint analysis of GPS and InSAR measurements from 1992 to 2014 is used to track ongoing volcanic deformation in a broad area centered ~6 km west of South Sister Volcano in central Oregon. We use the tdefnode software to model the observed deformation with a linear combination of steady background tectonic deformation across the Cascades volcanic arc and time-dependent inflation of a buried magma chamber with variable depth and geometry. We find that the observed InSAR interferograms and GPS-measured uplift and radially outward displacement of the ground is consistent with that predicted by an exponentially decaying rate of inflation within a ~7-km-deep, nearly spherical magma chamber. The main pulse of deformation started sometime in 1998, and the rate of deformation has since decayed with an exponential time constant of ~7 years. The post-2001, 3-D displacements measured by the continuous and campaign-mode GPS stations only are best-fit by decaying inflation of a slightly shallower 5-km-deep prolate spheroid with an aspect ratio of ~1.4. The continuous GPS displacement time series from station HUSB, installed in May 2001, provides the clearest evidence for smoothly decaying rate of deformation. This study does not support Riddick and Schmidt’s (G3, 2011) conclusion, based on 1992-2009 InSAR data only, that the volcanic deformation in this region is best fit by a piece-wise linear rate of decay, and it conflicts with their hypothesis that the source of deformation is an inflating sill. Our results are consistent with those of Dzurisin and others (JVGR, 2009), which were based on GPS data only.",

            "abstract": "Whistler mode radio sounding method [Sonwalkar et al., JGR, 2011] was applied to two case studies: (1) daytime and nighttime cases of whistler mode echoes observed on IMAGE inside the plasmasphere (L<4, altitude <5000 km), and (2) cases of whistler mode echoes observed during geomagnetic storm activity. Preliminary results indicate: (i) O+/H+ and O+/ (H+ + He+) transition heights at nighttime are a few hundred kilometers lower than that at daytime. (ii) Electron and ion densities found from whistler mode sounding are consistent with those from the past in situ and radio sounding measurements, but differ from those predicted by IRI-2012 and GCPM. (iii) Electron and ion densities undergo temporal changes as a function of geomagnetic storm activity, and each species has different recovery period. (iv) Major, moderate, and minor storms affect Ne, H+, and O+ densities in a similar manner, but affect He+ density differently-the minor storm did not affect it. By comparing the electron and ion densities measured by whistler mode radio sounding with those predicted by physics based ionospheric models (e.g. SAMI 2) it may be possible to understand how thermospheric winds influence the evolution of the ionospheric electron and ion densities during geomagnetic storms. The application of Sonwalkar et al. [2011] method to nonducted and ducted fast Z mode echoes observed on IMAGE has led to the measurement of field aligned electron density and duct width and enhancement factor from ~1000 km up to the equator. In two cases, ducts with widths of ~0.05-0.1 L and density depletions of ~5-10 % accounted for the observed properties of ducted Z mode echoes. The measurements of both electron density and ducts are consistent with past measurements. The results from the whistler and Z mode sounding will lead to new empirical models of field aligned electron and ion densities and a statistical characterization of ducts in the magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "In areas where regional strain is accommodated by broad zones of short and low slip-rate faults, geomorphic and paleoseismic characterization of faults is difficult because of poor surface expression and long earthquake recurrence intervals. In humid areas, faults can be buried by thick sediments and undetectable until the next earthquake. In Java, despite the frequency of damaging shallow earthquakes, active faults are diffuse and their characterization is challenging. Among them is the ENE-trending Cimandiri fault. Cumulative displacement along the fault produces prominent ENE-oriented ranges with the east side moving relatively upward and to the north. Along its length, the few hundred meter wide fault zone is expressed in the bedrock by numerous NE, E and NW-trending thrust- and strike slip faults and folds. However, it is unclear which of these structures are active, as the diffuse nature of the fault zone has so far stymied conventional paleoseismic study. To address this, we performed a tectonic geomorphology analysis of the fault zone. We used the 30-m resolution SRTM-DEM to construct longitudinal profiles of 601 bedrock rivers along the ranges and calculated the normalized channel steepness index (ksn). Our preliminary results rely on the assumption that ksn is a reasonable proxy for relative rock uplift rate in a region, assuming variations in rock type and climate are insignificant. While the active traces of the Cimandiri fault are obscured, the spatial variation in ksn allows us to delineate 4 discontinuous hanging wall blocks that vary between E and NE striking along the zone. The largest ksn values are along the central-western block (Cibeber area). The longest block is in the central eastern portion of the fault zone and comprises 45 km of the 100 km long fault zone. The fault bifurcates at its eastern termination and steps into the Lembang fault. The distribution of ksn suggests that reverse motion is more dominant than lateral because of a lack of kinematically consistent deformation associated with the steps along the fault zone. This geometric characterization of the active Cimandiri fault implies a maximum magnitude along its 100 km length of M7.5 but its geometric complexity suggests greater segmentation and smaller events—consistent with the limited historical record of upper plate earthquakes in Java.",

In addition we complemented our data with experimentally produced water leachates of rocks and soils.\nMg/Ca ratios >1 in much of the water samples indicate the influence of ultramafic rocks which dominate the geology on the geochemical composition of the groundwaters. Elevated Cr(VI) concentrations in experimental soil leachates, compared to those in rock pulp leachates, can be potentially explained by the presence of larger amounts of Fe(II) and lower amounts of Mn(IV) in the country rocks. Factor analysis on the 17 water samples from TV indicates a strong relationship between Na, Cl-, and Cr(VI), and also points to an aversion of Cr(VI) to nitrates (fertilizer-sewage sourced) and its independency from Mg and SiO2.\nAssuming that redox processes produce significant Cr isotope fractionation (groundwater δ53Cr values range between +0.62 and +1.99‰), the compilation of the analytical data suggests that the dominant cause of Cr isotope fractionation is post-mobilization reduction of Cr(VI). However, the lack of a clear negative relationship between Cr(VI) concentrations and δ53Cr values may reflect that other processes complicate this interpretation. The variation in δ53Cr values, together with the results from the experimentally produced ultramafic rock pulp leachates, imply initial oxidative mobilization of Cr(VI) from the ultramafic host rocks, followed by reductive processes, as the main reason for the toxicity of the groundwaters. Using a Rayleigh distillation model and different fractionation factors of Cr(VI) reduction valid for aqueous Fe(II) and a variety of Fe(II)-bearing minerals, we calculate that more than ~53%, but maximum ~94%, of the originally mobile Cr(VI) pool was reduced to immobile Cr(III) in the waters from CE and AB. This indicates that efficient processes in the aquifers may facilitate natural attenuation of the toxic Cr(VI) to less harmful Cr(III).",

The back projection analysis is very useful in analyzing large and/or complex fault processes, however, the physical meaning of obtained image is still not clear. To improve this problem, we introduce a new approach as follows. First, we stack seismic waveforms observed by a seismic array in a frequency range that is lower than the corner frequency of an earthquake of which Mo is known. Second, we calculate energy of stacked waveforms. Comparing Mo and the energy of stacked waveform, we obtain a transfer coefficient between Mo and the energy. If radiation pattern at the source and geometric attenuation on the ray path are corrected, it is expected that this coefficient has a unique value for the array. Once we obtained this transfer coefficient of the array, we can estimate Mo of other earthquakes from the product of the transfer coefficient and energy of stacked waveforms. For higher frequency range, we can calculate the transfer coefficient by using scaling law of earthquakes like w-square model. We will analyze middle class earthquakes by using this approach and report the results.",

            "abstract": "The Australian-Antarctic ridge (AAR) is the largest unexplored expanse of the global mid-ocean ridges. Using the Korean Icebreaker Araon, we carried out a multi-disciplinary study of two segments (KR1 and KR2) of intermediate spreading AAR in three expeditions from 2011 to 2013. KR1, a 300-km-long supersegment located in the center of AAR, has large transform faults at its two ends, only small 3rd and 4th order offsets between the transforms, and no overlapping spreading centers. Nonetheless there are large variations in axial morphology from axial high to rift valley, as well as large changes in chemical and Pb isotopic composition. The KR2 segment is located about 200 km northwest of KR1 and connected to it by the Balleny transform. KR2 is a 180 km-long 1st order segment bounded by two transforms and consists of a western segment with axial high and an eastern segment with rift valley. Along-axis geochemical variations indicate that the magma flux and ridge morphology of are influenced by changing mantle composition on a fine scale, and thus magma transport to the crust must occur at multiple locations along this single segment. Both the KR1 and KR2 segments are on the Pacific side of the Australian-Antarctic-Discordance, long considered as the boundary between Pacific and Indian mantle. However, isotopic and trace elements data of these segments differ from samples from the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge, so flow of Pacific mantle into Indian mantle bounded by the Australian-Antarctic-Discordance is no longer supported.",

            "abstract": "Many earthquake physical properties, such as seismic moment, rupture extent and stress drop, can be estimated from far-field seismic wave spectra. Corner frequency and the high-frequency fall-off rate of the spectra are often measured in order to make an assessment of dynamic stress drop and other source parameters such as radiated energy. Based on specific theoretic models, some quantitative relations have been established between far-field spectra and source properties. The most widely accepted model is described in Madariaga (1976), who performed a finite-difference simulation of a circular crack model. An important relation is fc=kb/a, where fc is azimuthally averaged corner frequency, b is S-wave speed, a is circular radius and k is an empirical constant with different values for P and S wave spectra. Many other models have been proposed, including the recent dynamically realistic rupture simulations of Kaneko and Shearer (2014), all of which have yielded a variety of different values for . However, models to date have been for relatively simple ruptures and the effect of rupture complexity, including heterogeneous stress and slip, on stress drop and scaled energy estimates has not been fully explored. Here, we consider complicated ruptures, which include fault roughness and complex pre-stress distributions, and compute the spectra that would be recorded by realistic distributions of surface stations. We then process the synthetic data using methods commonly applied to real data and attempt to quantify which fault properties can be reliably estimated from the observations and the most likely sources of errors in the analysis.",

The Newcastle area, situated on the southern margin of the Dublin Basin, exhibits elevated geothermal gradient (>30 °C/km) in the exploratory boreholes drilled by GT Energy.\nThe MT soundings were carried out in the highly urbanized Dublin suburb and are heavily noise-contaminated and distorted due to EM noise from nearby industry and the DC tram system. Processing the “quietest” 4-hour night time subsets of data using several robust codes and the ELICIT method we obtained reliable and interpretable MT impedance and geomagnetic transfer functions at most sites.\nTensor decomposition was applied at each site to ascertain if the data are suitable for 2D modelling and to determine the appropriate geoelectric strike direction. The final 2-D models underwent examination using a new stability technique, and the final two 2-D profiles with reliability estimations, expressed through conductance and resistivity, were derived.\n3-D models of all MT data in the Newcastle area have also been determined. The 3-D models exhibit higher conductive structures in comparison to the 2-D models, with similarly resistive background rocks. The shallow conductive structures, to the depth of 1 km, have north-south elongation correlated with surface traces of faults, which are perpendicular to the regional Blackrock to Newcastle Fault (BNF). Deeper structures become more oriented to regional geoelectric strike similar to 2-D regional strike.\nThe 2-D and 3-D modeling reveal that the BNF is imaged as a conductive zone to depths of 4 km and is likely highly fractured. Generally, the area south of the BNF is more resistive and compact with a horizontal conductive layer at approximately 1 km depth and with a very thin surficial sedimentary layer. In contrast, the structures north of the BNF are more heterogeneous, with deeper conductive layers (2-3 km depth) and thicker (several hundred meters) sedimentary layers above.\nThe deeper conductive layers are interpreted as water bearing or geothermal fluids and estimated porosity and permeability indicates potential to deliver warm water to the surface.",

Possible targets of the marine CSEM survey, other than hydrocarbon, may be marine hydrothermal mineral deposits. In transient EM (TEM) measurements, secondary fields which contain information on hydrothermal deposits in the seafloor can be measured in the absence of strong primary fields. The TEM system is useful to the development of compact, autonomous instruments which are well suited to submersible-based surveys. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of applying an in-loop TEM system to the detection of marine hydrothermal deposits through a one-dimensional modeling and inversion study. The feasibility study showed that TEM responses are very sensitive to a highly conductive layer. Time-domain target responses are larger and appear earlier in horizontal magnetic fields than in vertical ones. An inverse problem is formulated with the Gauss-Newton method and solved with the damped and smoothness-constrained least-squares approach. The test example for a marine hydrothermal TEM survey demonstrated that the depth extent, conductivity and thickness of the highly conductive layer are well resolved.",

            "abstract": "APHORISM project proposes the development and testing of two new methods to combine Earth Observation satellite data from different sensors, and ground data. The aim is to demonstrate that this two types of data, appropriately managed and integrated, can provide new improved GMES products useful for seismic and volcanic crisis management.\nThe first method, APE – A Priori information for Earthquake damage mapping, concerns the generation of maps to address the detection and estimate of damage caused by a seism. The use of satellite data to investigate earthquake damages is not an innovative issue. We can find a wide literature and projects concerning such issue, but usually the approach is only based on change detection techniques and classifications algorithms. The novelty of APE relies on the exploitation of a priori information derived by InSAR time series to measure surface movements, shake maps obtained from seismological data, and vulnerability information. This a priori information is then integrated with change detection map to improve accuracy and to limit false alarms.\nThe second method deals with volcanic crisis management. The method, MACE - Multi-platform volcanic Ash Cloud Estimation, concerns the exploitation of GEO (Geosynchronous Earth Orbit) sensor platform, LEO (Low Earth Orbit) satellite sensors and ground measures to improve the ash detection and retrieval and to characterize the volcanic ash clouds. The basic idea of MACE consists of an improvement of volcanic ash retrievals at the space–time scale by using both the LEO and GEO estimations and in-situ data. Indeed the standard ash thermal infrared retrieval is integrated with data coming from a wider spectral range from visible to microwave. The ash detection is also extended in case of cloudy atmosphere or steam plumes.\nAPE and MACE methods have been defined in order to provide products oriented toward the next ESA Sentinels satellite missions.\nThe project is funded under the European Union FP7 program and the Kick-Off meeting has been held at INGV premises in Rome on 18th December 2013.",

Clouds, on average, reduced TUV by 25 % and EUV by 22 % of the clear sky value, whereas reduces GS by 31 %. Similarly, aerosols reduced the two UV components by 21% on average, whereas reduced GS by 24 %.

In the absence of long-term instrumental data, multi-proxy (testate amoebae, plant macrofossils, δ13C, δ18O and δD) palaeoclimatic records from south Patagonian peatlands can provide valuable information about the long-term variability of the southern westerlies, a key component in determining the Southern Ocean’s function as a sink or source of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Similarly, multi-proxy palaeoclimatic reconstructions from moss banks provide a unique terrestrial palaeoenvironmental archive from the Antarctic Peninsula, where records of past ecological change are rare and provide vital context for the recent, rapid biotic change recorded since the mid-20th century.\nRobust chronologies are imperative for the accurate examination of spatial and temporal patterns in Holocene climate variation. Previous work has confirmed the presence of discrete tephra horizons in south Patagonian peatlands and Antarctic Peninsula moss banks but the examination of distal, cryptotephras is currently underemployed as a geochronological tool. The chronological potential of these archives is considerable, given their high and largely continuous accumulation rates and suitability for 14C dating, presenting additional opportunities to refine the ages of major Holocene eruptions. Here, we present initial tephrostratigraphic results from both regions and explore the links between them.",

The LS anomalous motions circumnavigate the globe several times, and the arrival of 150 hPa divergence anomalies and 300 hPa upward motion anomalies coincides with onset of widespread, deep, mesoscale convection over the Indian Ocean. Such motions are linked to at least four, and possibly five, separate MJO events between October 2011 and March 2012. Convergence is present at 150 to 300 hPa during convectively suppressed periods over the central Indian Ocean, and it is associated with subsidence above 500 hPa that at times exceeds the expected downward motion response to clear-sky radiative cooling. At Gan Island, the LS upward motion anomaly arrives as much as 2 days prior to onset of a LS convective event. Divergence anomalies appear within a day of the upward motion anomalies. Positive temperature anomalies arrive prior to the arrival of LS divergence aloft, indicating that the temperature anomalies do not destabilize the troposphere prior to MJO convective onset. We show further that changes in relative humidity at 300 hPa are strongly (weakly) influenced by changes in specific humidity (temperature). The anomalous vertical motions may influence the specific humidity variability. LS convective events can develop after LS subsidence moves out of the Indian Ocean as follows: Subsidence suppresses convection through drying, and convection flourishes when the subsidence propagates out of the area. Model simulations in a latitudinally wide WRF channel can replicate some of the LS structures of eastward propgating divergence and vertical motion even if domain boundaries are located in mid-latitudes; however such signals appear only during the October case. Modeled LS vertical motion and divergence is illustrated using a variety of boundary conditions. Additionally, the ability to replicate LS vertical motions in a highly idealized model with limited physics is demonstrated.",

Here we examine the link between EPEs on the Atlantic Margin of the Iberian Peninsula and ARs in the period 1979-2007, and show that for about 75% of cases there is a direct relation, and for many others, a second order or indirect connection; that is, they originate from moisture transported by an AR to a neighboring region the previous days that feeds another cyclone causing the actual event. EPEs in western Iberia present a pronounced seasonal cycle, being much more likely to occur in the autumn and practically inexistent in the summer. The incidence of ARs is however much higher and doesn’t show the same temporal frequency as EPEs, with a maximum in winter and a minimum, very marked in the south but not so much in the north, in summer. Only about 30% of ARs result in EPEs in autumn-winter and less than 10% in summer, likely due to differences in forcing, duration and thermodynamic characteristics of the ARs themselves. The interannual variability of EPEs and ARs can be quite large and uncorrelated, with years of high AR activity not necessarily years with high number of EPEs; nevertheless, EPEs are consistently linked to ARs.\nThe interannual variability of AR arrivals to the Iberian Peninsula mirrors that of AR activity in the southeast North Atlantic and it’s enhanced by negative NAO conditions. There are uncorrelated and important yearly variations in other quadrants of the North Atlantic, some being favored over others depending on persistent circulation anomalies. For periods of several years the entire North Atlantic can also present a significant amount of interannual variability in AR activity.",

            "abstract": "Using Large-Eddy Simulations with a simple representation of the cloud radiative effect, we confirm that the cloud radiative cooling at the top of the cloud is crucial to the simulation of the equilibrium, stratocumulus-capped boundary layer. In the perspective of representing this radiative cooling in a lower-resolution model, we study how spatial averaging can alter this equilibrium. Vertical averaging over large layers, or introducing some cooling above the cloud top destabilizes the stratocumulus equilibrium. On the other hand, the stratocumulus equilibrium is not very sensitive to horizontal averaging of the cloud radiative effect. Furthermore, we investigate whether the cloud radiative effect can be computed from the large-scale variables. We show that the variance of the liquid water path has to be taken into account. These experiments provide a set of necessary conditions to represent the cloud radiative effect in a larger-scale model such as a GCM or a CRM well enough to simulate the interaction between turbulence and cloud radiative effect essential to stratcumulus.",

            "abstract": "Desertification has been one of the global problems in respect of society, economy, and environment. However its cause and effect is diverse and complex, and yet not clearly identified. In order to understand and control desertification, monitoring using satellite images is a major and fundamental part. This study therefore aims to conduct time series analyses for Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and land cover change, and to analyse their area distribution between two different years targeted in Tunisia. NDVI and land cover map are obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which includes 17 land cover types. First, the time series analysis was conducted every three years from 2002 to 2011. Second, we compared area distribution of NDVI and land cover between 2002 and 2011. We defined that there was ‘severe’ desertification if NDVI was under 0.24 and classified the severe area within the two images respectively. The extracted area undergone severe desertification in 2011 was then overlaid on the NDVI map of 2002 to see the change. Barren or sparsely vegetated area of 2011 was also extracted first and overlaid on the land cover map of 2002 to observe how the land cover type had been changed from the past. It is estimated that desertification has been expanded in Tunisia as low NDVI value increases and barren or sparsely vegetated area expands while water or forest area decreases. In addition, the NDVI value of 2002 was higher and there was a little distribution of barren and sparsely vegetated area compared to 2011. Based on the result, this study is useful to realize the current state of affairs and the necessity of land planning in Tunisia. The result of the study is expected to be used to cope with desertification and land degradation, and further provides base data for establishing policies. This study was carried out with the support of ‘Forest Science & Technology Projects (Project No. S211214L030320)’ provided by Korea Forest Service.",

            "abstract": "Using high-resolution optical satellite imagery, and a 3-10 m resolution digital elevation model derived from declassified CORONA imagery, we mapped the trace of the central Sagaing fault and associated geomorphic features along the western flank of the Sagaing Hills. This approximately 350-km-long stretch of the Sagaing fault, which slips at about 2 cm/yr, lies only ~ 10 km west of the densely populated city of Mandalay. Much of this stretch of the fault has not produced a major earthquake (M > 7+) for over one century, and therefore is one of the potentially most dangerous seismic sources in SE Asia.\nOur new geomorphic mapping reveals more complex deformation patterns along the western side of the Sagaing Hills than hitherto pictured on published maps. The CORONA DEM shows clear evidence of on-going dextral transpression along the fault, consistent with the minor shortening component revealed by GPS (e.g., Socquet et al., 2006). Several hundreds of meters long, right-stepping step-overs characterize the fault north of the well-known Yega-In pull-part basin/lake, forming a series of overlapping dextral scarps at the surface.\nOur preliminary field and remote sensing observations suggest that the 1839 Ava earthquake, which may be the latest, largest destructive event along this section of the fault, was a great earthquake. We found minimum right-lateral displacements of about 5 to 7 meters. Such large amounts of plausibly single event co-seismic offsets suggest that the Mw magnitude of the 1839 earthquake may have ranged between 7.4 to 8+, which could scale with up to 300+ km rupture length (e.g., Biasi and Weldon, 2006) along the central Sagaing fault seismic gap, between Sagaing and Naypyidaw.",

We compare results derived from observed wave power with those from statistical characterisations based on geomagnetic indices such as Kp through the course of the main and recovery phases of storm-time Van Allen radiation belt dynamics. We find using the observed ULF wave power presents a remarkable explanation for the overall dynamics of the belts in terms of the impacts of inward and outward radial diffusion in association with plasmasheet sources and magnetopause shadowing. At ultra-relativistic energies the resulting dynamics demonstrate a remarkable simplicity which is controlled by the ULF wave power. ULF wave power can explain all of the morphologies of the Van Allen belts at ultra-relativistic energies in the form of either one, two or three belts. Overall, our results reveal that ULF waves truly provide an explanation for the 1,2,3 of ultra-relativistic radiation belt dynamics.",

Using a novel approach to quantify nitrate content in carbonates, we identified a trend of CAN increase in the late-Proterozoic, including several distinct peaks within a carbonate succession of the Sonora province, Mexico, deposited ~630-500 Ma. The goal of the current study was to investigate CAN variability in the context of the global “Shuram” event, a large negative δ13C excursion expressed in Rainstorm member carbonates of the Johnnie Formation in Death Valley, CA. The lower Rainstorm Member “Johnnie Oolite”, a time-transgressive, regionally extensive, shallow dolomitic oolite, was sampled. CAN concentrations ranged from 7.31 to 127.36 nmol/g, with higher values measured toward the base of the bed. This trend held at each sampled locality, along with a tendency towards decreasing CAN with larger magnitude negative δ13C excursions. Modern analog ooids formed in low-latitude marine environments lack CAN, consistent with their formation in low-nitrate waters of the euphotic zone characteristic of the modern ocean nitrogen cycling. In contrast, maximum values within the Johnnie oolite exceed by a factor of five to seven CAN measured in carbonates deposited below the main nitracline in the modern ocean, implying high nitrate content within shallow depositional environments. Johnnie oolite data, broadly consistent with the Sonora sequence findings, may indicate large perturbations in the Ediacaran nitrogen cycle immediately preceding the negative δ13C excursion. The implication of these findings for possible changes in the Ediacaran nitrogen, oxygen and carbon biogeochemical cycling will be further discussed.",

            "abstract": "Recent debate has focused on the potential preservation of the signal of seismic events in the sedimentary record via the initiation of large-scale turbidity current flows. The failure of a seismic zone lying across a series of submarine canyon systems may initiate multiple linked turbidity currents from each canyon head. Such events can be distinguished from locally triggered turbidity currents by their deposits. Canyon systems may be expected to become progressively interconnected with depth. Differing run out times of each interconnected channel is expected to result in pulsing flow behavior, a key feature of such turbidity currents. Thus, cyclical waxing to waning flow behavior preserved in the rock record may be a key indicator of a large-scale seismic trigger.\nNovel experimental research is presented that explores the dynamics of pulsed turbidity currents. The experimental study is used to quantitatively examine controls on the time and length scale of signal preservation in pulsing density driven flows. The experiments consisted of a multi gate lock box, with the gates remotely operated by pneumatic rams. Gate timers allow for accurate experimental repeatability and a careful investigation of the effect of time spacing between flows on pulsing flow dynamics. Parameters investigated include volumes of material released, effective flow density and viscosity (as a proxy of flow mud content). Full flow field visualization was made using an array of interlinked HD cameras. Dyeing separate components of the flow different colors enabled detailed analysis of flow dynamic behavior occurring between head and tail. The secondary pulsing flow was seen to rapidly overtake the first flow. Observations of flow velocity and density suggested that due to stratification the secondary flow was travelling along the density interface between the main body of the primary flow and its turbulent wake.\nAs the pulsing flows created in the laboratory experiments rapidly merged, it suggests that it is difficult to preserve pulsing signals of interacting turbidity currents over long run out distance or times. However, these initial experiments have been carried out with solute currents on flat slopes. Particulate currents travelling over a pronounced gradient may have a significantly different signal preservation behavior.",

            "abstract": "Kàrmàn vortex shading universally occurs when a uniform flow pasts a bluff body. Similar vortex shading occurs when an atmospheric flow hits an isolated mountain, and can be seen in satellite images when the vortices are accompanied by clouds. While previous idealized numerical studies have focused on the mechanism of the atmospheric Kàrmàn vortex shading, there has been no simulation for a real case.\nIn this study, a meso-scale non-hydrostatic model developed by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) is used to reproduce the observed Kàrmàn vortex shedding, where initial and boundary conditions are given by the meso-scale objective analysis data of the JMA. The cases investigated here occurred on 16 and 20 February 2013 when satellite images clearly capture Kàrmàn vortex shading behind the Jeju Island over the East China sea. The size of simulation’s domain is about 800 km by 1200 km in the horizontal direction, and the Jeju Island locates the center of the domain. The horizontal gird interval is 2 km. The cloud microphysics including the ice phase is considered.\nThe numerical simulation successfully reproduced realistic Kàrmàn vortex shading which accompany characteristic clouds in the wake of the Jeju Island (see Figure; shading show mixing ratio of cloud water). The size of the vortices and there intervals appear to be comparable to those observed by the satellite.\nThe winter monsoon flows out from Eurasia continent over the Yellow sea, which is 10 K warmer than the atmosphere, obtain much sensible and latent heat flux, and then a convective boundary layer is developed. Necessary conditions to form lee vortices proposed in previous studies are indeed satisfied: (1) the height of the convective boundary layer is lower than that of the mountain, and (2) the Froude number above the convective boundary layer is less than 0.4. The environment around the region in the wintertime is favorable for forming Kàrmàn vortex shading.\nThe pressure depressions associated with the vortices formed above the convective boundary layer induce updrafts from the convective mixed layer to the core of the vortices. The uplifted moist air condensed at the core of vortices visualizes the vortex shading.",

Plutons within the study area were emplaced into Kahiltna basin Mesozoic turbiditic strata. The Kahiltna sequence overlies Mesozoic Peninsular oceanic terrane rocks in the SE half of the basin and Proterozoic to Paleozoic Farewell continental terrane rocks to the NW. This study focuses on successive intrusion suites, most of which are thought to intrude Kahiltna or underlying Farewell terrane rocks, but include older, perhaps more deeply exhumed rocks emplaced in Peninsular terrane basement to the SE. The chemically diverse sequence records magmatism associated with major tectonic reorganization events on the southern Alaska circum-Pacific subduction margin. The oldest pluton suite (~100-80 Ma) is mostly intermediate to evolved calcalkaline granite and coincides with final closure of the Kahiltna basin and a regional transition to transpression-dominated tectonics. The post-closure magmatic pulse (~75-67 Ma) is compositionally varied, including primitive subalkaline melts, peraluminous high-K granites, and a subset of sodic, adakite-like granites. A Paleocene (~63-57 Ma) magmatic flare-up follows, dominated by extremely fractionated subalkaline melts. Rare, more primitive melts of this suite are metaluminous, from gabbro to syenite. This stage may represent relaxed melt productivity or shallowing of the slab dip, yielding more laterally diffuse melting. An early Eocene magmatic hiatus precedes middle Eocene circum-Pacific tectonic reorganization, regionally resulting in initiation of proto-Aleutian/Meshik arc magmatism, and locally in the 44–37 Ma emplacement of subalkaline intermediate to felsic plutons associated with andesite to rhyolite volcanic deposits. An Oligocene (~31–25 Ma) magmatic pulse involved emplacement of a compositionally variable suite ranging from gabbro to peralkaline granite, followed by waning magmatism coinciding with the preliminary exhumation data that may be associated with Yakutat slab subduction. These suites show the diversity of melt types and tectonic events that can account for significant juvenile crust accretion at an evolving continental margin.",

            "abstract": "The ability of the climate system to shift abruptly is exemplified by the so-called Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) cycles recorded in the Greenland ice cores, which involved temperature changes of several degrees within decades. It has been suggested that these abrupt climate fluctuations were accompanied by variations of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and associated sea ice feedback mechanisms. However, a paucity of well-dated and well-resolved marine climate archives, in particular from the southern hemisphere, has hampered our understanding of the exact role of the AMOC in these abrupt climate perturbations. Indeed, it remains unclear whether significant AMOC changes contributed to all DO-cycles. We present sub-millennially resolved proxy evidence for abrupt shifts in the deep ocean circulation and the presence of sea ice in the sub-Antarctic Atlantic during the last glacial period, both of which show a remarkable resemblance to abrupt climate variability over Greenland. Our results demonstrate persistent perturbations of the AMOC geometry, if not its overturning rate, across the entire Atlantic Ocean in association with each D-O cycle of the last glacial period. The quasi-instantaneous transmission of North Atlantic climate anomalies to both the surface- and the deep Southern Ocean implicates a very efficient oceanic and/or atmospheric teleconnection, which will be further discussed.",

Here receiver function (RF) analysis is used to image the crustal structures along an N-S profile (31N-43N) across the Qinling Orogen from the south, through Ordos Block and Yinshan Orogen to the north. The profile consists of 36 portable broadband stations which were deployed by Peking University during June 2012 to June 2014 and 12 permanent seismic stations of CEA. We selected teleseismic P waveforms from events with magnitudes Mw>5.0 and within the epicentral distances of 35-90 degrees and used the iterative time domain deconvolution method to obtain the RFs. Crustal thickness and the average Poison’s ratio are obtained by the use of H-k method while the 410 and 660 discontinuity depths are calculated by using common conversion point stacking method from the RF data. The fine structures from this receiver function study should help us to better understand the nature and evolution of the Western NCC.",

            "abstract": "Characterized in sufficient spatial proximity, Holocene fault slip rates may be used to test numerical model predictions of recurrent rupture behavior, including whether fault geometry produces a persistent control on rupture length. We document slip rate gradients along two subparallel strands of the Altyn Tagh fault (ATF) in western China as they pass through the 50-km-long, 15-20° transpressional double-bend at Aksay (~93°E). In the middle of the bend the southern fault (SATF) attains a strike 20° clockwise from regional fault strike, a bend angle that prior model results predict will inhibit throughgoing propagation of rupture. The northern fault (NATF) reaches only 15° clockwise from regional strike, at which angle model results indicate rupture may continue unimpeded. The sum of NATF and SATF slip rates at a given longitude gives the full sinistral slip rate of the ATF. Our mapping, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), Be-10, and C-14 geochronology, and paleoseismic results show that ruptures have not propagated through the bend on the SATF during at least the past 5-6 earthquake cycles, including the most recent surface rupture, which we have mapped and measured in detail. We map an abrupt west-to-east decline in mid-Holocene slip rate on the SATF from 5 ± 2 mm/yr west of the bend to 0 mm/yr in the middle of the bend. As the SATF straightens out again to the east, slip has largely been transferred to the NATF; a >10.7 ± 0.8 ka alluvial fan on the east side of the bend is offset merely 9.1 ± 1.2 m by the SATF, giving a Holocene slip rate of 0.9 ± 0.3 mm/yr and representing possibly only 2-3 Holocene earthquakes. On the NATF, we document a more gradual decline in slip rate through the bend, from 6.5 ± 2.5 mm/yr in the east to 2-3 mm/yr on the west. Fault morphology and the absence of an abrupt drop in slip rate on the NATF stand in stark contrast to the SATF and indicate that earthquakes on the NATF may span the bend. Our measured gradients in slip rate match the distribution of cumulative slip predicted by numerical dynamic-rupture models of this fault system. Correspondence of our field observations with the results of numerical models indicates that physics-based rupture simulations with realistic fault geometry may provide reliable predictions of plausible rupture extents and recurrence intervals.",

However, many other previous studies have poited that AAC and its aerosol absorption angstrom exponent(AAE) are strongly affected by the multi-scattering correction factor(C) when we retrieve AAC from aethalometer EBC mass concentration measurement(Weingartner et al., 2003; Arnott et al., 2005; Schmid et al., 2006; Coen et al., 2010). We determined the C value using the method given in Weingartner et al. (2003) by comparing 7-wavelngth aethalometer (AE-31, Magee sci.) to 3-wavelength Photo-Acoustic Soot Spectrometer (PASS-3, DMT) at Gosan climate observatory, Korea(GCO) during Cheju ABC plume-asian monsoon experiment(CAPMEX) campaign(August and September, 2008). In this study, C was estimated to be 4.04 ± 1.68 at 532 nm and AAC retrieved with this value was decreased as approximately 100% as than that retrieved with soot case value from Weingartner et al (2003). We compared the AAC determined from aethalomter measurements to that from collocated Continuous Light Absorption Photometer (CLAP) measurements from January 2012 to December 2013 at GCO and found good agreement in both AAC and AAE. This result suggests the determination of site-specific C is crucially needed when we calculate AAC from aethalometer measurements.",

            "abstract": "The southern Cascadia subduction zone (CSZ) of northwestern California exhibits northeast-directed contraction, transitioning to north-northwest directed translation within the broad San Andreas fault (SAF) transform margin to the south. The Little Salmon fault (LSF) is one of the southern-most, active thrust faults within the onshore fold and thrust belt of the CSZ, and lies proximal to the transition from compressional to dextral stress across the Mendocino Triple Junction. Thus, it is an ideal location to characterize strain associated with this complex region of transitional stress regimes. High precision topographic data (LiDAR) enabled detailed mapping of geomorphic features that would otherwise be obscured by dense vegetation of the area. A northwest trending lineament, sub-parallel and south of the main splay of the LSF is observed on LiDAR imagery. The lineament exhibits potential up-to-the-northeast offset and traverses several Van Duzen river terrace risers and treads that range from Pleistocene to potentially Holocene in age. A shallow, exploratory trench was hand-excavated across the lineament. The shallow, roughly 1.5 m-deep, 16 m-long trench exposed imbricated gravels that dip into the base of the trench in the upper end. Coring within the lower end of the trench mapped the southern extent of the gravels. The architecture of the unconsolidated, clast-supported gravel deposit displays a diffuse up-to-the-northeast step. More obvious offset may be expressed at lower depths and/or in mediums with more confining stress. The linear map expression of the lineament across relatively steep terrain suggests that the fault may be relatively steeply dipping. Conjugate deformation shear bands within Neogene bedrock nearby along the Van Duzen river provide additional information about the state of stress within this area of transition.",

However, field measurement of individual tree biomass is time-consuming, requires intensive labor, and is rather expensive, especially for tropical rain forest. As an alternative of this issue, application of remote sensing techniques to forest carbon quantification is essential. In this study, the plot biomass was predicted using LiDAR data and field measurements. The study area is located in Kuala Belalong Field Studies Centre (KBFSC), Brunei Temburong. KBFSC covers 25 ha native tropical rain forest and is consisted of mixed Dipterocarp. This study set total 54 plots (20m X 20m) in forest dynamics plot. The scheme of this study was as follows: 1) Calculate the plot biomass using field measurements, 2) Estimate the plot biomass using LiDAR data and field measurement, 3) Verify accuracy. The derived plot average biomass of LiDAR and field measurement were 376.16 Mg ha-1 and 391.85 Mg ha-1, respectively. This study focused on estimating forest biomass and it was converted to carbon stocks using carbon fraction.

The long-term over-exploitation of groundwater resources poses a challenge to water resource management in Taiwan. However, assessing groundwater resources in mountainous basins is challenging due to limited information. In this study, a geographic information system (GIS) and stable base-flow (SBF) techniques were used to assess the characteristics of groundwater recharge considering the Wu River watershed in central Taiwan as a study area. First, a GIS approach was used to integrate five contributing factors: lithology, land cover/land use, lineaments, drainage, and slope. The weights of factors contributing to the groundwater recharge were obtained from aerial photos, geological maps, a land use database, and field verification. Second, the SBF was used to estimate the groundwater recharge in a mountainous basin scale. The concept of the SBF technique was to separate the base-flow from the total streamflow discharge in order to obtain a measure of groundwater recharge. The SBF technique has the advantage of integrating groundwater recharge across an entire basin without complex hydro-geologic modeling and detailed knowledge of the soil characteristics. In this study, our approach for estimating recharge provides not only an estimate of how much water becomes groundwater, but also explains the characteristics of a potential groundwater recharge zone.",

            "abstract": "UV Aerosol Index(AI) using backscattered radiance at a single channel has been retrieved. In the current UV AI algorithm, two UV channels are used to contrast the absorbing aerosol loaded atmosphere to Rayleigh scattering condition. There have been needs to retrieve information of absorbing aerosol from a single UV channel, such as GOSAT CAI. 30-day minimum composite method, however, makes the process possible to construct the condition with the use of only single UV channel. Also, absorption by aerosol changes with respect to AOD and wavelength for different aerosol types. Therefore, single channel aerosol index(SAI) can detect absorbing aerosol qualitatively. Correlation coefficient of SAI to current UV AI indicate significant value, showing possibility of detecting highly absorbing aerosols. The application of a cloud screening makes the presence of absorbing aerosols even more clear. Radiative transfer calculations using VLIDORT were performed to test the sensitivity of SAI and UV AI to aerosol optical properties, showing that highly absorbing aerosol results in meaningful SAI. Results from dust case study in East Asia show reasonable performance of SAI for the region with single scattering albedo below 0.90. This study concludes with a comparison of SAI from GOSAT lv.1b data to OMI UVAI data, where reasonable agreement and low false detection was found for dust cases in East Asia. The SAI value of –0.2 to 0.0 from GOSAT-CAI was comparable to OMI dust threshold value of 0.7. These findings corroborate the suitability of SAI as a for detecting absorbing aerosols for satellite instrument with a single UV channel.",

Arabian Peninsula has one of the highest aerosol burdens due to dust storms, local petroleum industry, traffic and advection from southern Asia.

The terrain around the station is arid desert with very scarce yearly precipitation. There are no local pollution sources. Main instrumentation include: PM2.5 and PM10, number size distribution (7 nm - 10 μm) and total concentration, absorption and scattering coefficients, and the basic weather parameters.\nWe analysed the twin DMPS data from year 2013 classifying new particle formation events by visual day-to-day method. The days were classified following the principal presented in Dal Maso et al., (2005).

In the Innovative Program of Climate Change Projection for the 21st Century, many studies show a delay in the northward march of the baiu front, and significant increase of daily precipitation amounts around western Japan during the late baiu season (e.g., Kusunoki et al. 2011, Kanada et al. 2012). The future climate experiment in these studies was performed under the IPCC SRES A1B scenarios for global warming conditions.\nIn this study, we discuss the future changes in precipitation using calculated 60km-mesh model (MRI-AGCM3.2H) under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios. Support of this dataset is provided by the Meteorological Research Institute (MRI). These dataset are calculated by setting the Yoshimura (YS) scheme mainly.\nSeasonal progression of future precipitation generally indicates the northward in RCP2.6 and 4.5 scenarios, around western Japan. In RCP6.0 scenario, precipitation intensity is weak compared to the other scenarios. RCP8.5 scenario is calculated by setting three different cumulus schemes (YS, Arakawa-Schubert (AS), and Kain-Fritsch (KF) schemes). RCP8.5 configured in YS scheme showed that the rainband associated with the baiu front is not clear. Moreover, peak is remarkable during late June. In AS scheme, the precipitation area stagnates around 30 N until August. And it in KF scheme shows gradual northward migration.\nThis work was conducted under the Program for Risk Information on Climate Change supported by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology-Japan (MEXT).",

The datasets for the components of the atmospheric water balance include evaporation from the Hamburg Ocean Atmosphere Parameters and Fluxes from Satellite data (HOAPS), the Japanese Ocean Flux Data sets with Use of Remote Sensing Observations (J-OFURO2) and the Objectively Analyzed Air-Sea Heat Fluxes (OAFlux) and precipitation from the HOAPS, the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) and the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP). The water vapor tendency was derived from water vapor data of HOAPS. The product for water vapor flux convergence estimated using satellite observation data was used. The atmospheric balance components from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) reanalysis data were also examined. Residuals of the atmospheric water balance equation were estimated using nine possible combinations of the datasets over the ocean between 60°N and 60°S.\nThe results showed that there was considerable disagreement in the residual intensities and distributions from the different combinations of the datasets. In particular, the residuals in the estimations of the satellite-based atmospheric budget appear to be large over the oceanic areas with heavy precipitation such as the intertropical convergence zone, South Pacific convergence zone, and monsoon regions. The lack of closure of the atmospheric water cycle may be attributed to the uncertainties in the datasets and approximations in the atmospheric water balance equation. Meanwhile, the anomalies of the residuals from the nine combinations of the datasets are in good agreement with their variability patterns. These results suggest that significant consideration is needed when applying the datasets of water budget components to quantitative water budget studies, while climate variability analysis based on the residuals may produce similar results. The linear trends of the residuals were also obtained by least-squares regression with statistical significance levels. The regional characteristics of the trends will be also discussed.",

            "abstract": "A 570 cm long sediment core was recovered from 9°57ʹN and 131°42ʹW at 5,080 m water depth in the Clarion-Clipperton (C-C) fracture zone of the Northeast equatorial Pacific. The sediment core recovered is composed of alternating two phases showing dark brown and yellowish brown colors, respectively. The C-C zone shows various sedimentation rates of less than several mm/kyr and a zonal sediment distribution pattern. To clarify sedimentation age and possible periodical difference in sedimentation rates, paleomagnetic measurements and 10Be age dating are made. Stable characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) component converging to origin is isolated from at least five AF demagnetization steps between15 and 50 mT. Notably half of measurements shows that the ChRM component is almost antipodal against low-coercivity component erased in the AF fields of <15 mT. This phenomenon becomes clear near the boundary showing the ChRM polarity change, suggesting paleomagnetic signals are buried due to low sedimentation rates. As a result, eight times of geomagnetic field reversals are identified. In the reference geologic time scale, the eight reversal events correspond to the age of about 4.5 Ma. However, 10Be based age correction shows 13.4 Ma at the depth of 465 cm. In addition, calculated sedimentation rates are changed in the range of 0.1–2.44 mm/kyr. Around the depth of 110 cm, the lowest sedimentation rate occurs and paleomagnetic records of at least 1.8 Myr are erased. Distinctive correlation between sedimentation phase and rate can be found. Sedimentation rates of dark brown and yellowish brown sediments are <0.4 mm/kyr and >1 mm/kyr, respectively. Such alternation of sediments with different sedimentation rates are possibly caused by a periodical change in sediment provenances.",

            "abstract": "Taiwan locates in a high seismic activity belt of the southeastern Asia. In central Taiwan, many large earthquakes occurred in historic time, such as the 1906 Meishan (ML= 7.1), the 1935 Hsinchu-Taichung (ML=7.1), and the 1999 Chi-Chi (Mw= 7.6) earthquakes. GPS horizontal velocities, in addition, also show a shortening rate of up to 40 mm/yr across the Western Foothill to the Deformation Front. In this study, we employed a method of block modeling to study the interseismic behavior and evaluate slip deficits and earthquake potential of a series of N-S trended active faults in this area. We use the 2002-2012 GPS observations from 155 continuous and 449 campaign stations and set our model with 16 blocks and 12 boundary faults for the central Taiwan (Fig. 1). We first analyzed the sensitivity of the model parameters to the surface deformation for different block configurations, and results indicate that the shallow (<7 km) slips of the boundary faults can be better resolved than the deep (15 km) slips possibly due to the narrow aperture of our geodetic network (Fig. 1). We then calculated the geodetic long-term slip rates, which reflect relative motion between blocks, and the back-slip rates, which reflect interseismic fault coupling, of the boundary faults. Our preliminary results revealed that large rates of slip deficit (>6 mm/yr) occur on the N-S trended Tamaopu-Shuangtung and Sanyi-Chelungpu-Tachienshan-Chukou faults of the Western Foothill rather than the Changhua fault of the Deformation Front (see fault locations in Fig. 1). Although the Chelungpu fault was recently ruptured during the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake, we may still consider faults to its north, south, and east to have relatively high earthquake potential due to the fast absorption of contracted strain energy across the Western Foothill of Taiwan. Furthermore, two-dimensional dislocation modeling of interseismic fault loading is also under progress to justify the above block modeling results.",

            "abstract": "South Korea separates two mantle source domains for late Cenozoic intraplate volcanism in East Asia: depleted mid-ocean-ridge basalt (MORB) mantle–enriched mantle type 1 (DMM-EM1) in the north and DMM-EM2 in the south. We determined geochemical compositions, including Sr, Nd, Pb, and Hf isotopes for the Jeongok trachybasalts (~0.51 to 0.15 Ma K–Ar ages) from northernmost South Korea, to better constrain the origin and distribution of the enriched mantle components. The Jeongok basalts exhibit light rare earth element (LREE)-enriched patterns ([La/Yb]N = 9.2–11.6). The (La/Yb)N ratios are lower than that of typical oceanic island basalt (OIB). On a primitive mantle-normalized incompatible element plot, the Jeongok samples show OIB-like enrichment in highly incompatible elements. However, they are depleted in moderately incompatible elements (e.g., La, Nd, Zr, Hf, etc.) compared with the OIB and exhibit positive anomalies in K and Pb. These anomalies are also prime characteristics of the Wudalianchi basalts, extreme EM1 end-member volcanics in northeast China. We have compared the geochemistry of the Jeongok basalts with those of available Late Cenozoic intraplate volcanic rocks from East Asia (from north to south, Wudalianchi, Mt. Baekdu and Baengnyeong for DMM-EM1, and Jeju for DMM-EM2). The mantle source for the Jeongok volcanics contains an EM1 component. The contribution of the EM1 component to East Asian volcanism increases toward the north, from Baengnyeong through Jeongok to Mt. Baekdu and finally to Wudalianchi. Modeling of trace element data suggests that the Jeongok basalts may have been generated by mixing of a Wudalianchi-like melt (EM1 end-member) and a melt that originated from a depleted mantle source, with some addition of the lithospheric mantle beneath the Jeongok area. In Nd–Hf isotope space, the most enriched EM1-component-bearing Jeongok sample shows elevation of 176Hf/177Hf at a given 143Nd/144Nd compared with OIB. Recycled pelagic sediments may explain the EM1-end-member component of northeastern Asian volcanism, possibly from the mantle transition zone.",

A number of qualitatively different rupture fronts are observed. The rupture velocities selected by the system and the rupture form highly depend on the rupture direction relative to the slip direction.

            "abstract": "Hydrothermal alteration of oceanic lower crust has significant implications on geophysical properties of oceanic plates and global-scale geochemical cycles. A first order observation on the hydrothermal alteration at fast-spreading ridges is provided by the gabbroic rocks recovered from the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Site U1415 at the Hess Deep Rift near the East Pacific Rise. Shipboard observations of these rocks have revealed an alteration sequence formed under temperature conditions ranging from amphibolite to zeolite facies with mineral assemblages including amphibole, secondary clinopyroxene, chlorite, talc, serpentine, prehnite, zeolite and clay minerals (Gillis et al., 2014). Amphibolite-facies alteration is illustrated by the tremolite-chlorite corona textures between primary olivine and plagioclase in primitive olivine gabbro or troctolite lithologies (Nozaka and Fryer, 2011). The abundance of these alteration mineral assemblages within some sampled intervals suggests localized high-temperature fluid flow near the spreading axis. Our post-cruise studies prove that some of the coronitic amphiboles, particularly those of incipient-stage corona have hornblendic compositions, suggesting a somewhat higher-temperature formation condition than tremolite.\nWe report here another set of alteration products from Site U1415: that is, Al-spinel, corundum and diaspore. They occur in intensely altered parts of the drilled troctolites. The Al-spinel is associated with An-rich plagioclase and pargasitic amphibole that points to even higher temperature conditions than the amphibole-chlorite corona formation. The Al-spinel is partly replaced by corundum, and the corundum, in turn, is pseudomorphically replaced by diaspore. From modes of occurrence and chemical compositions of minerals, and thermodynamic calculations of the stability conditions for these mineral assemblages, we conclude that the highly aluminous phases were formed by localized fluid flow at temperatures ranging from upper-amphibolite to greenschist facies.\n",

            "abstract": "For more than 12 years we have been conducting a continuous monitoring of downhole pore pressures at multiple sub-bottom intervals in ODP Holes 808I and 1173B situated landward and seaward of the deformation front in the Nankai Trough off Cape Muroto. We found that the pressure response to the semi-diurnal ocean tide (M2), both amplitude and phase, gradually changed during the observed period. The M2 amplitudes at most depths in Hole 808I decay as their phase delay (up to 45 degrees), only if the amplitude is larger than ~0.2 of that for the seafloor. On the other hand, we observe an anomalous phase lead (up to -40 degrees) if the relative amplitude is smaller than ~0.2. We hypothesize that the recorded pore pressure is a combination of two components; one with larger amplitudes and phase-delay and the other with small amplitude and phase-lead. The former is interpreted to be caused by a direct communication between sensors and the seafloor through the space of the annulus. It gradually attenuated by the decrease in hydraulic diffusivity around the sensors, as the annulus space is packed off by a gradual collapsing of the formation. After that, we hypothesize that the sensor is in good mechanical/hydrological contact with the formation, and that the latter variation is identical or close to that of formation pressure variation. The mechanism of the latter variation remains enigmatic, but a feasible explanation is the existence of a layer, next to the sensor, with the contrast in fluid bulk modulus, frame bulk modulus, or permeability (Wang and Davis, 1996). At Site 808, numerous small fractures were detected in cores/logs, which can generate such contrast in bulk modulus or permeability. Other causes, such as solid earth tide or thermal expansion/contraction caused by a tidally-induced flow within the casing cannot explain both the amplitude and phase simultaneously. We propose that a tidal response signal can be used to detect local fracture zones or gas-rich layers.",

            "abstract": "Transpiration and heat exchange rates by plant leaves involve coupled physiological processes of significant ecohydrological importance. Prediction of the effects of changing environmental conditions such as irradiance, temperature, humidity and wind speed requires a thorough understanding of these processes. The common assumption that leaf temperature equals air temperature may introduce significant bias into estimates of transpiration rates and water use efficiency (WUE, the amount of carbon gained by photosynthesis per unit of water lost by transpiration). Theoretical considerations and observations suggest that leaf temperatures may deviate substantially from air temperature under typical environmental conditions, leading to greatly modified transpiration rates compared to isothermal conditions. In particular, effects of wind on gas exchange must consider feedbacks with leaf temperature. Systematic quantification of the effects of wind speed on leaf heat and gas exchange rates yield some surprising insights. We found a range of conditions where increased wind speed can suppress transpiration rates. The result reflects unintuitive feedbacks between sensible heat flux, leaf temperature, leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficit and latent heat flux. Modelling results suggest that with high wind speeds the same leaf conductance (for water vapour and carbon dioxide) can be maintained with less evaporative losses. This leads to positive relation between water use efficiency and wind speed across a wide range of conditions. The presentation will report results from a lab experiment allowing separation of the different leaf energy balance components under fully controlled conditions (wind speed, temperature, humidity, irradiance) and put them into perspective with a detailed leaf energy balance model and the commonly used Penman-Monteith equation.",

            "abstract": "Microbial sulfate reduction followed by sulfide mineral burial, typically as pyrite, represents the largest removal pathway for sulfur from the exogenic sulfur reservoir. During microbial sulfate reduction, sulfur isotopes are partitioned such that the lighter 32S isotope is preferentially reduced; the magnitude of this partitioning has a large range (0 to 72‰), and therefore the average sulfur isotope composition of the global pyrite burial flux remains enigmatic. Recent work has mapped the global spatial distribution of microbial sulfate reduction rates in the modern ocean, which allows conclusions to be drawn concerning the conditions and controls on where sulfate respiration occurs (Bowles et al., 2014). The local rate of sulfate reduction in a particular sediment column can be calculated by the change in sulfate concentrations in pore fluids below the surface, which yields the net ﬂux of sulfate into marine sediments. A ﬂux of sulfate into the sediment is assumed to be due to diffusion along a concentration gradient set up by the consumption of sulfate at depth. We have calculated the deep-sea rates of microbial sulfate reduction using over 700 drilling sites and arrive at a similar estimate of the global modern rate of sulfate respiration.\nRates of sulfate reduction are not, however, the same as the rates of pyrite burial, which is likely limited to the uppermost sediments where reactive iron may be available, or in the most nearshore environments where the terrestrial supply of iron is high and rates of sulfate reduction are orders of magnitude higher than those in the deep-sea. Sulfur isotope fractionation during microbial sulfate reduction is a function of several environmental factors, including the rate of sulfate reduction. We use a new compilation of the link between sulfate reduction rate and sulfur isotope fractionation with a model of pyrite burial in a range of modern marine sediments to derive an estimate of the global pyrite burial flux and its sulfur isotope composition. We conclude that the deep ocean pyrite burial flux is isotopically lighter than the shallow ocean pyrite burial flux. This suggests that in past oceans the distribution of shallower environments may be the key control on the sulfur isotope composition of the global pyrite burial flux.",

            "abstract": "In August 2014 ESA’s Rosetta mission has started the exploration of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko comet nucleus. VIRTIS-M, the Visible InfraRed Thermal Imaging Spectrometer, onboard the orbiter (Coradini et al., 2007) has acquired the entire nucleus’ illuminated hemisphere in the 0.25-5.1 µm spectral range from a heliocentric distance of 3.2 AU. These data allow us to derive albedo and compositional maps suitable to trace the distribution of dust and refractory material, water and carbon dioxide ices, and other minor species. Two different mapping phases are currently foreseen: 1) in August 2014 during early “Comet Characterization (CC)” period, when the spacecraft will orbit between 50-100 km distance from the nucleus with 25°-40° solar phase angle. A large number of these observations shall be performed at stationary illumination conditions (constant solar phase at about 30°) allowing us to reduce the effect of photometric corrections on surface’s mosaics; 2) in September 2014 during the “Global Mapping Phase (GMP)” when the spacecraft shall be at about 30 km distance and 60°-70° phase. During these two periods, VIRTIS-M on-ground resolution shall be about 12-25 and 7.5 m/pixel, respectively. The GMP is planned for more detailed observations of some pre-selected Philae landing sites, although in worse illumination conditions with respect to the CC. In addition, to mitigate the effects of the expected compositional differences, surface roughness and the highly irregular double-lobed shape of the comet’s nucleus, we have planned to observe each surface’s point more than one time at different illumination conditions. Finally, compositional maps are built by using specific VIS-IR spectral indicators (Filacchione et al., 2012) namely: band ratios, spectral slopes, band parameters (depth, position, width, asymmetry) adapted to characterize the different spectral classes of the nucleus’ surface. Beyond being appropriate to map surface composition, those indicators allow us to infer regolith grain size and surface roughness and to correlate them with local morphological features (patches, boulders, scarps, crevasses, active areas) and thermal properties.

            "abstract": "Inverse modeling of atmospheric transport is a technique that systematically searches for space-time distributions of trace gas fluxes that yield modeled atmospheric concentrations close to observations. This technique has been employed for the estimation of surface CO2 flux distributions in better understanding the mechanisms of the global carbon cycle. As this inference relies on observations, several studies were conducted in the past to see the sensitivity of flux estimates to the expansion of surface monitoring networks over time and the choice of data-providing sites in the estimation. These studies showed that changes in the geographical distribution of the surface data have a large impact on regional-scale flux estimates.\nWith the advent of the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) in early 2009, the spatial coverage by the surface monitoring networks can now be widely expanded with the spaceborne soundings, from which column-averaged CO2 concentrations (XCO2) are retrieved. These GOSAT-based XCO2 retrievals are made available by five research groups, and their precisions have been reported to be below 2 ppm level. Where they coincide, the five XCO2 retrievals (all biases corrected) agree within one standard deviation of less than 1 ppm. On one hand, the extent that each of the XCO2 retrieval data product covers the surface differs from one to another, owing to differences in the retrieval algorithms and data screening criteria, and the coverage differences were found to be dependent on geographical locations.\nWe investigated the extent to which these data-coverage differences alter constraints on individual regional CO2 flux estimates. For this, we used a diagnostic known as the resolution kernel, which quantifies how well the regional flux estimates can be resolved by the observations. The inversion system used here is the same as what is used to generate the GOSAT Level 4 regional flux data product, and consists of NIES 08.1i transport model and the Kalman Smoother optimization scheme. Here, we will present the results for several representative regions including eastern Asia that are under-sampled by the surface networks but well-observed by the satellite. We will also touch briefly on the latest GOSAT Level 4 CO2 data product.",

            "abstract": "Oceanography is no longer just an Earth Science. Standing bodies of liquid that interact with both atmospheric and surface reservoirs are known to exist on Titan, and are thought to have existed on early Mars. The exchange of heat, moisture, and momentum between lakes/seas and the atmosphere are of fundamental importance to the hydrologic systems of all three bodies. The generation and propagation of wind-waves, and their consequent shoreline erosion, are key factors in air-sea-surface exchange. Titan, in particular, offers a laboratory in which to understand these processes at a more fundamental level. Much of the parameterization for wave models on Earth are empirical, despite laboratory studies that have demonstrated wave growth depends on both gravity and fluid properties. Titan’s exotic environment ensures that even rudimentary measurements of wave generation will provide valuable data to anchor physical models. Furthermore, in the presence of wind waves, Cassini can be used as an anemometer to measure wind speeds over hydrocarbon liquids.\nHerein, we will report on the results of the Aug 21st altimetry observation over Titan’s largest sea, Kraken Mare, and interpret them in the context of wave activity and composition (from passive radiometry). On Earth, it is rare to observe a body of water whose surface is not disturbed by some form of wave activity. On Titan, Cassini observations through the end of its Equinox Mission in Dec 2010 showed no indication of waves. These observations are intriguing given the predominance of aeolian features at equatorial latitudes and have been attributed to the light winds predicted during the Titan winter. More recently, however, the previous series of upper limits and non-detections are giving way to indications that the expected freshening of winds in northern summer may be causing sporadic ruffling of the sea surfaces. Specifically, apparent sunglints offset from the geometric specular point has been observed by VIMS in Punga Mare and a transient radar signature has been observed over the surface of Ligeia Mare. SAR images also reveal morphologies consistent with secondary coastlines, most notably at Ontario Lacus and Ligeia Mare. In addition to the altimetry of Kraken, we will also discuss the potential role of wind-waves in shaping coastal morphologies observed in SAR images.",

In this study, we integrated Spectral Angular Mapper (SAM) technique and aeromagnetic data to map the gold mineralization associated within alteration zones in CED. The spectral reflectance curves of five main alteration minerals (Hematite, Illite, Kaolinite, Chlorite, and Quartz) were utilized as end members in the SAM supervised classification of ETM+ data. Each alteration mineral type was represented as a binary image that overlaid together to obtain single primary alteration map in CED. The possible pathways for the alteration migration was defined based on the subsurface and surface lineation features. For the subsurface lineation, Euler deconvolution filter was applied on the aeromagnetic data to locate the deep-seated faults. The surface lineation and shear zones were extracted from ETM+ data and used together with the subsurface lineation map to obtain a structural map. Layer intersection and fuzzy membership operation were applied for the entire datasets to identify the possible sites of alteration zones. Several GPS readings were taken from the field areas around the gold mine sites, and used as validation points for our primary results.",

            "abstract": "The Imager of Sprite and Upper Atmosphere Lightning (ISUAL) onboard the Taiwanese satellite Formosat-2 has continuously observed transient luminous events (TLEs) within the +/-60 degree range of latitude for a decade since May 2004. The lightning electromagnetic pulse is responsible for Elves , the dominate TLE type which accounts for approximately 80% of the total TLE count according to the ISUAL global survey. By analyzing the limb-viewed images with a wavelength filter of 622.8-754nm, 72% of elves are found to be ‘glued’ to the OH Meinel band (~630nm) nightglow layer within its thickness of 8km, with the OH layer normally at an altitude of 87 km (Huang et al., 2010).This collocation of elves and airglow layer is frequently dismissed as coincidence, since the physical mechanisms for the formation of the two optical phenomena are macroscopically quite different. However, a common ingredient in the atmospheric chemistry is monatomic oxygen. O is needed to make O3 and ultimately hydroxyl OH, the main radiative species of the airglow layer. O is also needed to form nitric oxide NO, the species with the lowest known ionization potential (9.26 eV) in the D-region. Thomas (1990) has documented steep increases in O concentration in the 83-85 km altitude range and Hale (1985) has found steep increases in electrical conductivity in the 84-85 km range, both with rocket measurements. A great simplification of the nighttime ionosphere is the presence of a single photon energy—10.2 eV—Lyman-α, originating in monatomic H in the Earth’s geocorona. A simple Chapman layer calculation for the altitude of maximum photo-dissociation of O2, using the measured absorption cross-section of O2 at the Lyman-α energy, shows an altitude of maximum O production at 85 km. Elve emission in the nitrogen first positive band is enhanced by the presence of free electrons from ionized NO, but too large a conductivity will lead to the exclusion of the radiation field from the lightning return stroke and suppress the elve emission.. These comparisons of marked changes in key quantities over a narrow range of special altitudes lend support to O being the main player in linking electrical and optical behavior in elve emission.",

The degree and extent of sun geometry influences on satellite observations have important implications on the utility of multi-sensor time series for generating accurate long-term data records. Here we investigate sun angle interactions on tropical forest greening using Terra- and Aqua-MODIS, and combined Terra-Aqua Nadir BRDF Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) vegetation index (VI) time series, with distinct seasonal and daily sun angle conditions for 10:30 a.m., 1:30 p.m. overpasses, and local solar noon times, respectively. This was compared with modeled, sun angle corrected data from the MODIS MCD43A1 product for fixed sun angles. The interactions between sun angle and forest greening were analyzed along an equatorial forest transect of constant sun-earth geometry but variable annual rainfall and dry season length, as well as a latitudinal transect ranging from equatorial to dry southern forests. In equatorial forests, seasonality in sun angle geometry was synchronous with drought seasonality and resulted in broad scale, forest greening consistent with the duration of the dry season and light availability. The sun angle corrected data showed a reduction in the magnitude of seasonal greening, but also revealed an extended greening period well beyond the equinox. On the other hand, across the latitudinal gradient there were shifts in the start and duration of the dry season that resulted in greening patterns that were asynchronous with sun angle geometries. Sun angle influences became significant and were more pronounced at greater latitudes, demonstrating need to normalize cross-sensor satellite data for sun geometry effects, especially with the recent and upcoming launches of new satellite systems.",

In this study the relationship between climate model biases in the control climate and the simulated climate sensitivity are discussed on the basis of perturbed physics ensemble simulations with a globally resolved energy balance (GREB) model. It is illustrated that the uncertainties in the simulated climate sensitivity can be conceptually split into two parts: a direct effect of the perturbed physics on the climate sensitivity independent of the control mean climate and an indirect effect of the perturbed physics by changing the control mean climate, which in turn changes the climate sensitivity, as the climate sensitivity itself is depending on the control climate. It is discussed whether correcting the models by tuning or by artificially correcting the control mean state (flux correcting) would be a better way of improving the climate change predictions.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying soil water availability in water-limited ecosystems on plant water use continues to be a practical problem in agronomy. Transpiration which represents plant water demand is closely in relation to root water uptake in the root zone and sap flow in plant stems. However, few studies have been concentrated on influences of soil moisture on root water uptake and sap flow in crops. This study was undertaken to investigate (i) whether root water uptake and sap flow correlate with the transpiration estimated by the Penman-Monteith model for winter wheat(Triticum aestivum), and (ii) for which soil water potentials in the root zone, the root water uptake and sap flow rates in crop stems would be reduced. Therefore, we measured sap flow velocities by an improved heat-balance approach (\nLangensiepen et al., 2014\n), calculated crop transpiration by Penman-Monteith model, and simulated root water uptake by HYDRUS-1D on an hourly scale for different soil water status in winter wheat. In order to assess the effects of soil water potential on root water uptake and sap flow, an average soil water potential was calculated by weighting the soil water potential at a certain depth with the root length density. The temporal evolution of root length density was measured using horizontal rhizotubes that were installed at different depths.The results showed that root water uptake and sap flow matched well with the computed transpiration by Penman-Monteith model in winter wheat when the soil water potential was not limiting root water uptake. However, low soil water content restrained root water uptake, especially when soil water potential was lower than -90 kPa in the top soil. Sap flow in wheat was not affected by the observed soil water conditions, suggesting that stomatal conductance was not sensitive to soil water potentials. The effect of drought stress on root water uptake and sap flow in winter wheat was only investigated in a short time (after anthesis). Further research could focus on a long time (e.g. from vegetation to maturity) effect under different soil water conditions, such as irrigated, sheltered and normal status.\nLangensiepen, M., Kupisch, M., Graf, A., Schmidt, M. and Ewert, F., 2014.

            "abstract": "The Ionian Sea is a landlocked basin where convergence between Africa and Eurasia produced the emplacement of two opposite verging subduction/rollback systems (i.e. the Calabrian and the Hellenic Arcs). It is one of the most seismically active regions in the Mediterranean Sea and has been struck repeatedly by destructive historical earthquakes, often associated with tsunamis. Slab tearing in a pre-collisional setting is reflected in dynamic topography with high uplift rates of the coastal mountain belts, accompanied with a great sediment discharge to the continental margins. This increases the susceptibility to mass failures implying a strong interplay between active tectonics, seismic shaking, mass flows and tsunami generation.\nWe investigated the effects of historic earthquakes on abyssal marine sedimentation through the analysis of the turbidite record in tectonically controlled basins. Holocene resedimented units in the deep Ionian Sea represent more than 90% of the total thickness of the sedimentary record. We dated the most recent turbidite sequences using different radiometric methods and the results suggest that turbidite emplacement was triggered by major historic earthquakes and tsunamis recorded in the region (i.e. AD 365 Crete and AD 1169, 1693 and 1908 Italian earthquakes).\nTextural, micropaleontological, geochemical and mineralogical signatures reveal that turbidite beds are stacked sandy units, which have different compositions suggesting coeval multiple failures. They are characterized by organic-rich sandy layers, containing a mixture of lithic clasts, plant fragments and displaced benthic foraminifera derived from several sources and bathymetric ranges. Structure and composition of each turbidite unit, combined with geochemical and isotopic analysis on organic carbon, are being refined to unravel the relative contribution of seismic shaking and tsunami wave loading on mass flow processes generation.\nTurbidites may be considered as the sedimentary earthquake code within the background pelagic sedimentation. Deciphering this code aims at reconstructing paleo-seismicity during several earthquake cycles, a time span long enough to perform reliable seismic and tsunami hazard assessment in tectonically active coastal regions.",

            "abstract": "An invigoration of deep convection by cold pools is supported by two conceptually different theories: a) mechanic lifting of air-parcels at the cold-pool boundary and b) thermodynamic preconditioning of boundary-layer air due to rings of enhanced water-vapor content (~ +1 g/kg). The latter have been associated with the leading edges of radially spreading cold pools in studies of precipitating convection over tropical oceans. Even recovered cold pools exhibit these moisture anomalies and the formation of such rings thus also plays a critical role in theory (a) through the moistening of ambient air that is later lifted by another cold-pool.\nDespite the described relevance, the origin of these water-vapor rings is unclear. This motivates us to conduct idealized large-eddy simulations with the purpose of explaining the origin of these water-vapor rings. The simulations are coupled with a recently designed framework to track Lagrangian water particles and allows us to decompose the emerging vapor distribution according to its origin. The emerging quasi-axisymmetric flow transitions from a vortex-dominated downdraft in the early stage to a radial gravity current in the later stage. Preliminary results highlight the dominating role of moisture that resides in the boundary layer before deep convection is initiated. A delineation of the individual contributions from boundary-layer moisture, evaporated hydrometeors, and latent heat fluxes reveals that the latter two sources may not be crucial for the anomalous moisture content over the radial distances considered. The sensitivity to the initial moisture of the boundary-layer and the effects of entrainment into the cold pool will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Earthquakes are among the most destructive natural disasters in Turkey and it is important to assess seismicity in different regions with the use of seismic networks. Bursa is located in Marmara Region, Northwestern Turkey and to the south of the very active North Anatolian Fault Zone. With around three million inhabitants and key industrial facilities of the country, Bursa is the fourth largest city in Turkey. Since most of the focus is on North Anatolian Fault zone, despite its significant seismicity, Bursa area has not been investigated extensively until recently. For reliable seismic hazard estimations and seismic design of structures, assessment of potential ground motions in this region is essential using both recorded and simulated data. In this study, we employ stochastic finite-fault simulation with dynamic corner frequency approach to model previous events as well to assess potential earthquakes in Bursa. To ensure simulations with reliable synthetic ground motion outputs, the input parameters must be carefully derived from regional data. In this study, using strong motion data collected at 33 stations in the region, site-specific parameters such as near-surface high frequency attenuation parameter and amplifications are obtained. Similarly, source and path parameters are adopted from previous studies that as well employ regional data. Initially, major previous events in the region are verified by comparing the records with the corresponding synthetics. Then simulations of scenario events in the region are performed. We present the results in terms of spatial distribution of peak ground motion parameters and time histories at selected locations.",

This limitation is particularly clear for tropical forests, despite the risk of drought to these ecosystems during the coming decades. We present new findings from the only current long-term 'ecosystem-scale' (1 ha) rainfall manipulation experiment in tropical rainforest, the Esecaflor experiment at Caxiuana National Forest, Para State, Brazil. Throughfall has been partially excluded from experimental forest at the Esecaflor experiment for more than a decade. We have previously demonstrated a capacity to model short-term physiological responses well, but longer term physiology and ecological dynamics remain challenging to understand and represent. In particular, high mortality and increased autotrophic respiration following extended drought are poorly understood phenomena, and their interaction with hydraulic responses and limitations needs to be characterised. We present initial data that for the first time combine carbon use and hydraulic metrics, comparing drought-vulnerable and non-vulnerable species that have experienced extended soil moisture deficit, as imposed in the experiment, also considering the response in soil respiration. We also discuss how these findings can be used to develop future empirical and modelling studies aimed at improving our capacity to predict the effects of drought on tropical forest ecosystems in Amazonia and in other tropical forest regions where species characteristics and environmental constraints may influence both short and long-term responses to drought.",

            "abstract": "The interaction between the NW-directed trajectories of moisture transport associated with the Indian Summer Monsoon circulation and the high topography of the Himalayan orogen results in one of the most efficient orographic barriers on Earth. The steep topographic gradients, the impact of focused rainfall along the southern flank of the range, and northward shifts of rainfall during frequent intensified Indian Summer Monsoons are responsible for an efficient erosional regime, with some of the highest known erosion rates. The spatiotemporal correlation between various topographic, tectonic, climatic, and exhumational phenomena in this region has resulted in the formulation of models of possible long-term erosional and tectonic feedback processes that drive the lateral expansion and vertical growth of the mountain belt. However, despite an increase in thermochronologic, cosmogenic radionuclide, and sedimentological datasets that help explain the underlying mechanisms, the true nature of these relationships is still unclear and controversies particularly exist concerning the importance of the different forcing factors that drive exhumation and, ultimately, deformation. Here, we synthesize and assess these controversies with observations from studies conducted perpendicular to and along strike of the orogen, and combine them with our new basin-wide erosion-rate data from the Sutlej Valley in the NW Himalaya. In our regional comparison we highlight the importance of large river systems and climate-controlled aspects of weathering concerning fluvial mass distribution as there appear to be positive feedbacks between tectonics and surface processes. In contrast, observations from smaller catchments along the orogenic front suggest a negative correlation. Similar to other environments with steep topographic and climatic gradients, our observations from the Sutlej catchments emphasize that erosional processes in the Himalayan realm are most efficient in geomorphic environments that combine large catchments characterized by sufficiently high precipitation and runoff with spatiotemporal shifts in the locus of intensified monsoonal rainfall.",

            "abstract": "The SAGE 2014 survey was conducted directly west of the Santo Domingo Pueblo, along Borrego Canyon Road. This survey is a continuation of the SAGE 2010 and 2011 investigations. The survey was aimed to locate a previously mapped fault running orthogonal to the road. The SAGE 2014 seismic line ran 5.6 km long with 20 meter geophone spacing. 8-80 Hz sweeps were utilized with 10 s sweeps and 4 s of listening. Once the data was converted into the proper file type, preprocesses was conducted. After the preprocessing was complete, various processing methods were used to obtain the final Common Midpoint (CMP) stack. Two CMP stacks were created-one containing the muting method and one without. The ideal result would be to interpret stratigraphic structures and potential faults.\nThe Rio Grande Rift is a Cenozoic continental rift zone that extends approximately 1000 km from Leadville, Colorado to west Texas and Chihuahua, Mexico. The Northern most extent of the rift separates the Great Plains from the Colorado Plateau. The rift consists of a series of interconnected grabbens that lie in an asymmetric pattern (Baldridge, 1989). Basins involved with this rifting are a distinct features along with faults that bound one or both sides. SAGE has been investigating these for over a decade to interpolate the complex structures. By examining Borrego Canyon, we were able to add to the investigation.\nVarious geophysical methods were utilized to study Borrego Canyon. AMT, MT, TEM, gravity, seismic reflection and seismic refraction were individually used to understand the subsurface and were subsequently integrated together in order to have a full spectrum of subsurface depths. Each method has unique processing steps and are critical in order to analyze the gathered data. As such, this paper will focus on processing seismic reflection with an emphasis on muting.\nEach technique used in processing the SAGE 2014 seismic reflection data will be explained. Next, this paper will validate muting in seismic reflection processing and demonstrate its importance in obtaining an accurate and visually pleasing final product. With the final product, a brief geological interpretation of the subsurface can be conducted. An explanation of the poor data and the lack of reflections will be given.",

            "abstract": "The increasing probability of water resource scarcity due to climate change has highlighted the need for adopting an economic focus in modelling water resource uses. Hydro-economic models, developed by integrating economic optimization with biophysical crop models, are driven by the economic value of water, revealing it’s most efficient uses and helping policymakers evaluate different water management strategies. One of the challenges in integrating biophysical models with economic models is the difference in the spatial scales in which they operate. Biophysical models that provide crop production functions typically run at smaller scale than economic models, and substantial spatial aggregation is required. However, any aggregation introduces a bias, i.e., a discrepancy between the functional value at the higher spatial scale and the value at the spatial scale of the aggregated units.\nThe objective of this work is to study the sensitivity of net economic benefits in the Yakima River basin (YRB) to different spatial aggregation methods for crop production functions. The spatial aggregation methodologies that we compare involve agro-ecological zones (AEZs) and aggregation levels that reflect water management regimes (e.g. irrigation districts).\nAggregation bias can distort the underlying data and result in extreme solutions. In order to avoid this we use an economic optimization model that incorporates the synthetic and historical crop mixes approach (Onal & Chen, 2012). This restricts the solutions between the weighted averages of historical and simulated feasible planting decisions, with the weights associated with crop mixes being treated as endogenous variables.\nThis study is focused on 5 major irrigation districts of the YRB in the Pacific Northwest US. The biophysical modeling framework we use, BioEarth, includes the coupled hydrology and crop growth model, VIC-Cropsyst and an economic optimization model. Preliminary findings indicate that the standard approach of developing AEZs does not perform well when overlaid with irrigation districts. Moreover, net economic benefits were significantly different between the two aggregation methodologies. Therefore, while developing hydro-economic models, significant consideration should be placed on the aggregation methodology.",

            "abstract": "Decompression-induced crystallization of hydrous basalt during magma ascent from 1.5 kb (150 MPa) is quantified using isothermal decompression TZM experiments. The starting composition is a synthetic glass based on the 1921 Kilauea basalt, with 1% H2O added. In all cases, the liquidus phase is aluminous spinel, followed by clinopyroxene, then plagioclase. The plagioclase liquidus temperatures for isobaric (equilibrium) experiments range from 1175°C (at 1.5 kb) to 1217°C (at 200b), which are 35-75°C hotter than predicted by MELTS (Ghiorso & Sack 1995). Experiments were decompressed at 1kb/hr and quenched at 800, 400, 200, or 100b for three temperatures (1160°, 1150°, and 1140°C). Plagioclase crystals formed during decompression have long axes that range from less than 1 micron to 20 microns. Increasing decompression yields larger plagioclase crystal sizes and aspect ratios for experiments at equal temperatures. However, the number of crystals does not vary systematically, indicating that crystallization is dominated by growth rather than nucleation during decompression. Plagioclase compositions for experiments were measured with University of Bristol’s Electron Microprobe and the Hyperprobe with Field Emission Gun. Plagioclase compositions from equilibrium experiments (An60-An80) span the range of those from decompression experiments (An60-An73). Equilibrium experiments generated higher An compositions at lower pressures (500b) than at higher pressure (1.5kb) but do not systematically vary with temperature. Variations in plagioclase compositions are minimal above H2O saturation (100-200°C, based on Papale et al., 2006). Below H2O saturation, An content decreases slightly, by approximately 4% An. One application of this work is better characterization of groundmass crystallization in hydrous basalt as it traverses the conduit during eruption. This work also provides a means of distinguishing groundmass plagioclase related to decompression from crystals generated in the flow channel following eruption. These data will be useful in quantifying processes associated with a’a and pahoehoe flow morphologies.",

            "abstract": "Alkenes are reactive hydrocarbons that play important roles in the photochemical production of tropospheric ozone and in the formation of secondary organic aerosols. The light alkenes (C2-C4) originate from both biogenic and anthropogenic sources and include C2H4 (ethene), C3H6 (propene) and C4H8 (1-butene, 2-butene, 2-methylpropene). Light alkenes are used widely as chemical feedstocks because their double bond makes them versatile for industrial reactions. Their biogenic sources are poorly characterized, with most global emissions estimates relying on laboratory-based studies; net ecosystem emissions have been measured at only one site thus far. Here we report net ecosystem fluxes of light alkenes and isoprene from a semi-arid ponderosa pine forest in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, USA. Canopy scale fluxes were measured using relaxed eddy accumulation (REA) techniques on the 28-meter NCAR tower in the Manitou Experimental Forest Observatory. Updrafts and downdrafts were determined by sonic anemometry and segregated into ‘up’ and ‘down’ reservoirs over the course of an hour. Samples were then measured on two separate automated gas chromatographs (GCs). The first GC measured light hydrocarbons (C2-C6 alkanes and C2-C5 alkenes) by flame ionization detection (FID). The second GC measured halocarbons (methyl chloride, CFC-12, and HCFC-22) by electron capture detection (ECD). Additional air measurements from the top of the tower included hydrocarbons and their oxidation products by Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS). Three field intensives were conducted during the summer of 2014. The REA flux measurements showed that ethene, propene and the butene emissions have significant diurnal cycles, with maximum emissions at midday. The light alkenes contribute significantly to the overall biogenic source of reactive hydrocarbons and have a temporal variability that may be associated with physical and biological parameters. These ecosystem scale measurements will be compared with estimates used in global emissions models.",

            "abstract": "We examined quiescence and activation models to obtain the conditional probability that a large earthquake will occur in a specific time period on different scales in Taiwan. The basic idea of the quiescence and activation models is to use earthquakes that have magnitudes larger than the completeness magnitude to compute the expected properties of large earthquakes. We calculated the probability time-series for the whole Taiwan region and for three sub-areas of Taiwan – the western, eastern, and northeastern Taiwan regions – using 40 years of data from the Central Weather Bureau catalog. In the probability time-series for the eastern and northeastern Taiwan regions, a high probability value is usually yielded in cluster events such as events with foreshocks and events that all occur in a short time period. In addition to the time-series, we produced probability maps by calculating the conditional probability for every grid at the time just before a large earthquake. The probability maps show that high probability values are yielded around the epicenter before a large earthquake. The ROC curves of the probability maps demonstrate that the probability maps are not random forecasts, but it also suggests that lowering the magnitude of a forecasted large earthquake may not improve the forecast method itself. From both the probability time-series and probability maps, it can be observed that the probability obtained from the quiescence model increases before a large earthquake and the probability obtained from the activation model increases as the large earthquakes occur. The results led us to conclude that the quiescence model has better forecast skill than the activation model.",

            "abstract": "For tsunamis passing through sharp bathymetric variability, such as a shoal or a harbor entrance channel, z-axis vortical motions are created. These structures are often characterized by a horizontal length scale that is much greater than the local depth and are herein called shallow turbulent coherent structures (TCS). These shallow TCS can greatly increase the drag force on affected infrastructure and the ability of the flow to transport debris and floating objects. Shallow TCS typically manifest as large “whirlpools” during tsunamis, very commonly in ports and harbors. Such structures have been observed numerous times in the tsunamis over the past decade, and are postulated as the cause of large vessels parting their mooring lines due to yaw induced by the rotational eddy.\nThrough the NSF NEES program, a laboratory study to examine a shallow TCS was performed during the summer of 2014. To generate this phenomenon, a 60 second period long wave was created and then interacted with a breakwater in the basin, forcing the generation of a large and stable TCS. The model scale is 1:30, equating to a 5.5 minute period and 0.5 m amplitude in the prototype scale. Surface tracers, dye studies, AVD’s, wave gages, and bottom pressure sensors are used to characterize the flow. Complex patterns of surface convergence and divergence are easily seen in the data, indicating three-dimensional flow patterns. Dye studies show areas of relatively high and low spatial mixing. Model vessels are placed in the basin such that ship motion in the presence of these rapidly varying currents might be captured. The data obtained from this laboratory study should permit a better physical understanding of the nearshore currents that tsunamis are known to generate, as well as provide a benchmark for numerical modelers who wish to simulate currents.",

            "abstract": "The topographic evolution of the world’s major orogens exerts a strong impact on atmospheric circulation and precipitation patterns and is a key element in reconstructing the interactions among tectonics, climate, and Earth surface processes. Using carbonate stable and clumped isotope data together with low-temperature thermochronology information from the terrestrial Eocene Chumstick Basin (Central Washington; USA), today located to the East of the Washington Cascades, we investigate the E-W extent of the western North American plateau region and the evolution of Cascade topography.\nOxygen isotope measurements of Eocene (51 to 37 Ma) pedogenic carbonate concretions and calcic horizons yield low δ18Ocarbonate values of +9 to +13 ‰ (SMOW) despite the proximity of the Eocene Chumstick Basin to the Pacific moisture source and paleofloral data that indicate moderate elevations and montane rain forest conditions during a warm and rather wet, seasonal climate. This either suggests that 51-37 Ma ago Cascade-like topography characterized the western edge of the North American-Pacific plate margin to the West of the Chumstick Basin or that the δ18Ocarbonate data were variably reset or only formed during burial and diagenesis.\nClumped isotope (Δ47) thermometry of pedogenic carbonate and carbonate concretions (n=11 samples) indicates spatially variable burial temperatures of 80 to 120 °C that correlate with vitrinite reflectance data in these sediments. In concordance with changes in depositional environment the youngest (<40 Ma) Chumstick sediments experienced a lesser degree of post-depositional burial and heating (ca. 70 - 80 °C) compared to the older Chumstick series (80 – 120 °C).\nCalculated δ18O values of the circulating fluids in the Chumstick basin sediments range from -6 ‰ (T ~100 °C at ca. 40-30 Ma) to -9 ‰ (T ~75 °C at ca. 25-15 Ma). These values suggest a low-altitude meteoric fluid source and as a consequence only moderate Cascade topography during the Eo-/Oligocene. The combined stable isotope and clumped isotope data, therefore support models of late Miocene Cascade uplift and provide insight into the topographic configuration of the western North American plate margin prior to the late Miocene.",

            "abstract": "We have completed high resolution geological mapping of impact melt deposits at the young lunar complex craters (<1 billion years) Copernicus, Jackson and Tycho using data from recent missions. Crater floors being the largest repository of impact melt, we have mapped their morphological diversity expressed in terms of varied surface texture, albedo, character and occurrence of boulder units as well as relative differences in floor elevation. Examples of wall and rim impact melt units and their relation to floor units have also been mapped. Among the distinctive features of these impact melt deposits are: 1) Impact Melt Wave Fronts: These are extensive (sometimes several kilometers in length) and we have documented their occurrence and distribution in different parts of the crater floor at Jackson and Tycho. These features emphasize melt mobility and style of emplacement during the modification stage of the craters. 2) Variations in Floor Elevations: Spatially extensive and coherent sections of crater floors have different elevations at all the three craters. The observed elevation differences could be caused by subsidence due to cooling of melt and/or structural failure, together with a contribution from regional slope. 3) Melt-Covered Megablocks: We also observe large blocks/rock-fragments (megablocks) covered in impact melt, which could be sections of collapsed wall or in some cases, subdued sections of central peaks. 4) Melt-Covered Central Peaks: Impact melt has also been mapped on the central peaks but varies in spatial extent among the craters. The presence of melt on peaks must be taken into account when interpreting peak mineralogy as exposures of deeper crust. 5) Boulder Distribution: Interesting trends are observed in the distribution of boulder units of various sizes; some impact melt units have spatially extensive boulders, while boulder distribution is very scarce in other units on the floor. We interpret these distributions to be influenced by a) the differential collapse of the crater walls during the modification stage, and b) the amount of relative melt volume retained in different parts of the crater floor. These observations provide important documentation of the morphological diversity and better understanding of the emplacement and final distribution of impact melt deposits.",

            "abstract": "Hydrogen isotope ratios of plant leaf waxes are increasingly used as a proxy for past hydrologic variability. However, a number of environmental variables influence the net fractionation between leaf waxes and the environmental water from which their hydrogen is ultimately derived. Salinity effects are of particular importance in coastal tropical and subtropical settings, where deuterium discrimination increases by 1.5‰ per salinity unit in the leaf wax n-alkanes of the grey mangrove, Avicennia marina. It is not possible to tell whether sedimentary n-alkanes are from mangrove plants, or from terrestrial plants that are not exposed to salt water. The salinity component of hydrogen isotope fractionation therefore complicates leaf wax hydrogen isotopes in most tropical coastal marine and lacustrine settings. However, a strong relationship between salinity and a more specific mangrove lipid biomarker could provide the basis for a paleosalinity and water isotope proxy in low-latitude coastal environments.\nHere we present results from a calibration study of Rhizophora spp. (red mangroves) growing on the Micronesian islands of Pohnpei and Palau, using taraxerol, a biomarker that is largely specific to this genus in these settings. We observed an increase in net deuterium discrimination between surface water and taraxerol of 1.2‰ per salinity unit. We investigated potential mechanisms for this increase at high salinity by measuring the hydrogen isotopic composition of leaf and xylem water from Rhizophora spp. Contrary to most terrestrial plants, xylem water in these trees is depleted relative to surface water, with greater relative depletion at higher salinities. This could be the result of increased deuterium discrimination during water uptake, as a greater percentage of salt is excluded by roots at higher salinity. Alternatively, it could indicate that some of the water in the xylem is from relatively depleted freshwater (rain and or dew) that enters the plant through the leaves, and that this source becomes increasingly important at higher salinities. We also observed decreased leaf water enrichment relative to xylem water at higher salinity, which is consistent with foliar uptake of fresh water for mangroves growing in saline conditions.",

            "abstract": "The end of the Pleistocene marked the extinction of a great variety of arctic megafauna, which, in part, led to the conversion of arctic grasslands to modern Siberian larch forest. This shift may have increased the vulnerability of permafrost to thawing because of changes driven by the vegetation shift; the higher albedo of grassland and low insulation of snow trampled by animals may have decreased soil temperatures and reduced ground thaw in the grassland ecosystem, resulting in protection of organic carbon in thawed soil and permafrost. To test these hypothesized impacts of arctic megafauna, we examined an experimental reintroduction of large mammals in northeast Siberia, initiated in 1988. Pleistocene Park now contains 23 horses, three musk ox, one bison, and several moose in addition to the native fauna. The park is 16 square km with a smaller enclosure (< 1 km) where animals spend most of their time and our study was focused. We measured carbon-pools in forested sites (where scat surveys showed low animal use), and grassy sites (which showed higher use), within the park boundaries. We also measured thaw depth and documented the soil invertebrate communities in each ecosystem. There was a substantial difference in number of invertebrates per kg of organic soil between the forest (600 ± 250) and grassland (300 ± 250), though these differences were not statistically significant they suggest faster nutrient turnover in the forest or a greater proportion of decomposition by invertebrates than other decomposers. While thaw depth was deeper in the grassland (60 ± 4 cm) than in the forest (40 ± 6 cm), we did not detect differences in organic layer depth or percent organic matter between grassland and forest. However, soil in the grassland had higher bulk density, and higher carbon stocks in the organic and mineral soil layers. Although deeper thaw depth in the grassland suggests that more carbon is available to microbial decomposers, ongoing temperature monitoring will help determine whether or not differences detected in summer continue throughout the year. This study provides a preliminary understanding of the role megafauna play in carbon emissions from the arctic, and suggests that animals play a critical role in regulating permafrost thaw and the fate of carbon stored in Arctic soils.",

            "abstract": "The solar wind interaction with a planetary atmosphere produces the magnetic pile-up region near the planet. The Martian magnetic pile-up region prevents direct penetration of shocked solar wind (magnetosheath) plasma and the penetration boundary is typically located at altitudes above 800 km. Spacecraft measurements have shown, however, that magnetosheath plasma occasionally penetrates into low altitudes below 400 km. Here we used Mars Global Surveyor magnetic field and electron observations during the period from April 1999 to November 2006 to investigate the magnetosheath penetration events. We identified 240 events and found that both solar wind dynamic pressure (Psw) and the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) control the occurrence of the events. The magnetosheath penetration events during the low Psw periods tend to be distributed in low latitudes of the northern hemisphere where the crustal magnetic field is weak, while the event locations widely distributed in terms of the latitude under high Psw conditions. During the low Psw periods, a remarkable feature is that the observational probability is approximately 7 times larger during periods of the “away” IMF sector than during the “toward” sector. These results thus indicate that the magnetosheath penetrations into Martian upper atmosphere more often occur in the upward electric field hemisphere than in the downward electric field hemisphere. Large-amplitude undulation excited by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the upward electric field hemisphere previously suggested from global hybrid simulation can be one of candidate processes to cause the asymmetric penetration during low Psw periods.",

However, except for Chengdu, the trends in all cities and plains are low than their nearby mountains. The climatological visibilities of cities are much lower than mountains and the negative trends of visibility in cities are larger than those in mountains. The hazy days (visibility < 10 km) in cities also show the larger positive trends than those in mountains. There are larger aerosol concentrates in low visibility situations and the cooling radiation effects of aerosol induce the lower temperature trends in cities than in mountains.

            "abstract": "Mineral dust fertilization of Southern Ocean surface waters, and mixing with Antarctic deep-water, influences oceanic uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide and draws down global atmospheric CO2concentration during glacial periods. Quantifying modern variability in dust source and transport strength, especially with respect to high- and low-latitude climate phenomena (e.g. SAM, ENSO), will improve understanding of this important aspect of the global carbon cycle.\nHere we present data from a new intermediate-depth, coastal ice core drilled at Roosevelt Island, Antarctica as part of the Roosevelt Island Climate Evolution (RICE) project. Using HySPLIT forward trajectories, climate reanalysis and geochemistry data, this work explores variability in atmospheric transport for modern Southern Hemisphere dust source areas (primarily Australia, southern South America and southern Africa). While New Zealand represents a relatively small dust source at present, it is strongly-connected to the Antarctic due to its position within the circumpolar westerly winds and was a major dust source during the last glacial period. Geochemical data from the RICE ice core (79.36ºS, 161.71ºW, 550 m a.s.l.) are used to constrain sources of dust in this sector. The lanthanide elements—common in crustal material and not susceptible to fractionation—can preserve the signature of their original source material, allowing for characterisation of dust provenance. Initial results suggest that only air trajectories originating in New Zealand regularly reach the Ross Sea, Marie Byrd Land and Roosevelt Island within 3 to 5 days (see Figure 1), a characteristic travel time of suspended dust particles. We discuss estimates of the relative source strength of New Zealand compared with other dust source areas to evaluate its overall contribution.\nFigure 1: Daily 96-hour forward trajectories for Southern Hemisphere dust source areas, 2010-2013 (NOAA HySPLIT, NCEP reanalysis).

            "abstract": "How do we best communicate scientific results? As the number of scientists and scientific papers steadily increases, one of the greatest challenges is effective and efficient sharing of science. The official repository of scientific knowledge is the peer-reviewed journal archive. However, this primary knowledge can be difficult to access and understand by anyone but a relevant specialist. We propose some new ideas for diagramming the content and significance of scientific papers using a simple and intuitive graphical approach.\nWe propose a visual mapping that highlights four fundamental aspects of most scientific papers: Data, Methods/Models, Results/Ideas, and Implications/Importance. Each of these aspects is illustrated within boxed fields which contain one or more labeled elements positioned to reflect novelty (aka originality) and impact relative to the vertical and horizontal axes. The relative position of the boxed fields themselves indicates the relative significance of data, methods, ideas, or implications to the paper. Optional lines between boxed elements indicate the flow and dependence of data/methods/ideas within the paper. As with any graphical depiction, you need to see it to best appreciate it -- this written abstract is only meant as an introduction to the idea.\nWe anticipate that diagramming may prove useful in both communication of scientific ideas among scientists as well as in education and outreach. For example, professors could assign diagramming of papers as a way to help students organize their thoughts about the structure and impact of scientific articles. Students could compare and defend their diagrams as a way to facilitate discussion/debate. Authors could diagram their own work as a way to efficiently summarize the importance and significance of their work. We also imagine that (in the future) automatic diagramming might be used to help summarize or facilitate the discovery of archived work.",

The site efficiently merges information from NOAA’s Tsunami Warning Centers (TWC’s) by way of a comprehensive XML feed called Tsunami Event XML (TEX). The resulting unified view allows users to quickly see the latest tsunami alert status in geographic context without having to understand complex TWC areas of responsibility. The new site provides for the creation of a wide range of products beyond the traditional ASCII-based tsunami messages. The publication of modern formats such as Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) can drive geographically aware emergency alert systems like FEMA’s Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS). Supported are other popular information delivery systems, including email, text messaging, and social media updates. The Tsunami.gov portal allows NOAA staff to easily edit content and provides the facility for users to customize their viewing experience. In addition to access by the public, emergency managers and government officials may be offered the capability to log into the portal for special access rights to decision-making and administrative resources relevant to their respective tsunami warning systems. The site follows modern HTML5 responsive design practices for optimized use on mobile as well as non-mobile platforms. It meets all federal security and accessibility standards. Moving forward, we hope to expand Tsunami.gov to encompass tsunami-related content currently offered on separate websites, including the NOAA Tsunami Website, National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program, NOAA Center for Tsunami Research, National Geophysical Data Center’s Tsunami Database, and National Data Buoy Center’s DART Program. This project is part of the larger Tsunami Information Technology Modernization Project, which is consolidating the software architectures of NOAA’s existing TWC’s into a single system.

            "abstract": "Modelling subsurface structures is mainly performed in under-constrained contexts as only sparse and indirect data are available. Stochastic modelling is the common strategy to solve such problems, especially since such subsurface 3D models serve as support for quantitative studies (e.g.: reservoir characterizations, etc.). Multiple 3D models are generated from the dataset and represent a sampling of plausible subsurface structure representations. From this model sampling, statistical analysis on targeted parameters (e.g.: reserve estimations, flow behaviours, etc.) and a posteriori uncertainties are performed to assess risks. However, on one hand, uncertainties may be huge, which requires many models to be generated for scanning the space of possibilities. On the other hand, some computations performed on the generated models are time consuming and cannot, in practice, be applied on all of them. This issue is particularly critical in CO2 storage studies as many scales of investigations are required, from meter to regional ones, to estimate storage capacities and associated risks. Recent petroleum studies propose to define distances between models to allow sophisticated multivariate statistics to be applied on the space of uncertainties so that only sub-samples, representative of initial set, are investigated for dynamic time-consuming studies. In this work, it is proposed to define such distances in the particular case of CO2 storage as differences exist between the petroleum and CO2 storage dynamic behaviours and problematic. Moreover, particular interests are also paid to the characterization of the topology of the reservoir rocks. The skeleton of the reservoir rock is studied through graph spectral analysis and topological indices. A synthetic data set of fluvial models with different geological characteristics was generated and studied using the defined distance. Relationships between model settings and distances are shown and discussed.",

Its driving factors in the past need to be understood and quantified for projection of future changes and management of water available. Here by applying the Budyko water-energy balance framework, we analyse the hydro-climatic fluctuations at annual scale and their natural and anthropogenic drivers during past fifty years in six major Chinese drainage basins, from south to north, and from natural basins to human-modified basins. Natural forcing here means the fluctuations in precipitation and temperature, and the shift of precipitation from snow towards rain. And we focus on the impact of change in vegetational coverage, agricultural irrigation and water division as anthropogenic effect. By cross-regional comparison and within-region comparison, we explore the spatial variability of the hydro-climatic change and the type and contribution of different driven factors, especially various human modifications, throughout China. This study shows how the complex coupled system of climate, human and eco-hydrology can be described and explored by an effective and simple model and how the water balance constraints of hydrological basins affect water available throughout China and their spatial variability in the past half century.",

            "abstract": "On 28 September 2004, the M6.0 Parkfield earthquake took place on the San Andreas fault, California. A seismic station which is named PKD and located near the epicenter recorded both of the seismic and electromagnetic (EM) signals during this earthquake. This station is operated by\nBerkeley Seismological Laboratory\nand installed with broadband seismometer and EM sensors which are close to each other. Significant seismic signals as well as clear coseismic EM signals were recorded during this earthquake, providing a good opportunity to study the coseismic EM phenomenon.\nWe modeled the coseismic EM signals from the viewpoint of the electrokinetic effect on the basis of Pride’s equations. The earthquake source is taken as a finite fault with length of 40 km along the strike direction and width of 15 km along the dip direction. The source parameters that we use for calculation were inverted by Liu et al. [2006, BSSA] by utilizing the seismic data. While in their inversion the earth crust are treated as 7 horizontally-layered elastic solids, in our calculation these solid layers are regarded as porous media. Each porous layer has the same P-velocity, S-velocity and density to its counterpart solid layer. The salinity is set to be 0.1 mol/L for all the layers so that conductivity is uniformly distributed with the value of 0.036 S/m. To evaluate the electric and magnetic responses during the rupturing of the earthquake, we use the algorithm developed by Hu and Gao [2011, JGR] which calculates both the seismic and EM wavefields simultaneously. Since the inversion of source parameters was operated in the frequency band 0.16 Hz-1 Hz, we filter both of the synthetic seismoelectric wavefields and the real data before making comparison between them. Our preliminary result shows that in this frequency range, the amplitude of the simulated coseismic electric field is of the order of 1µV/m, which is the same to the real electric data. This supports the electrokinetic effect to be an effective and reasonable mechanism for the generation of the coseismic electric field.",

            "abstract": "Resulting from an electrokinetic coupling generated under seismic excitation, the seismoelectric (SE) effect appears as a promising tool for porous media characterization. However, due to the incomplete understanding of the underlying physics, observations remained strictly qualitative for a long time. Eventually in the 1990’s, Pride’s robust explanation for the SE effect opened new prospects. Within a decade, a dynamic formulation of the coseismic transfer function had been given, that expresses the coseismic electric field E relatively to the acceleration ü.\nOur purpose is to confront this model to measurements carried out on a simple porous medium at lab scale. In this experiment, a seismic wave propagates within a 120l-sandbox, filled with unconsolidated monodisperse quartz sand, for varying water contents and fluid conductivities. The seismic wave is generated by a pneumatic source of wide frequency spectrum allowing for measurements at the kilohertz range. The sandbox is equipped with 20 accelerometers, 5 water-sensors and a 30 rods electrode array. All captors are placed with a maximum offset of 30cm to the source.\nBy changing salinity in the range [2-8mS/m] at constant saturation, we observed a decrease in the |E/ü| transfer function proportional to the salinity increase, as expected by Pride and already reported in literature. This proved the experimental setup to be suitable for further quantitative measuring, being in our case a SE monitoring under saturation variations. After a relaxation time, a dramatic increase in seismic velocities attested full saturation. The ensuing SE monitoring while draining, going from 100 to 35% water-content, showed a change in the sign of the E/ü ratio consistent with Pride’s predictions. In the meanwhile, seismic records exhibited velocity changes in agreement with a patchy evolution of the saturation",

            "abstract": "The ability to estimate the spatial and temporal distributions of biomarkers has been identified as a key need for planning life detection strategies. In a typical planetary exploration scenario, sampling site selection will be informed only by remote sensing data; however, if a difference of a few tens of meters, or centimeters, makes a significant difference in the results, science objectives may not be met.\nWe conducted an analogue planetary expedition to test the correlation of three common biomarker detection methods -- cell counts through fluorescence microscopy, ATP quantification, and quantitative PCR with universal primer sets (bacteria, archaea, and fungi) -- and their spatial scale representativeness. Sampling sites in recent Icelandic lava fields (Fimmvörđuháls and Eldfell) spanned four nested spatial scales: 1 m, 10 m, 100 m, and > 1 km. Each site was homogeneous at typical 'remote sampling' resolution (overall temperature, apparent moisture content, and regolith grain size).\nNo correlation between cell counts and either ATP or qPCR data was significant at any distance scale; ATP quantification and the archaeal and fungal qPCR data showed a marginal negative correlation at the 1 m level. Visible cell count data was statistically site-dependent \u0004\u0005for sites 10 m and 100 m apart, but not for sites > 1 km apart, whereas ATP results and qPCR data showed site dependence at all four scales. Distance had no significant effect on variability in cell counts and qPCR data, but was positively correlated with ATP variability.\nThese results highlight the difficulty of choosing a 'good' biomarker: not only may different methods yield conflicting results, but they may also be\u0004 \u0004differentially representative \u0005\u0005of the overall area. \u0004We intend to expand on this work with a follow-up campaign using comprehensive assays of physicochemical site properties to better distinguish between effects of environmental variability and intrinsic biomarker variability.",

Compared to the old, one-layered canopy formulation with no heat mass, this module now offers a level of physical detail consistent with the detailed snow and soil representation in SNOWPACK. The new canopy model is designed to reproduce the difference in thermal regimes between leafy and woody canopy elements and their impact on the underlying snowpack energy balance. The new model is validated against data from an Alpine and a boreal site.\nComparisons of modelled sub-canopy thermal radiations to stand-scale observations at Alptal, Switzerland, demonstrate the improvements induced by our new parameterizations. The main effect is a more realistic simulation of the canopy night-time drop in temperatures. The lower drop is induced by both thermal inertia and the two-layer representation. A specific result is that such a performance cannot be achieved by a single-layered canopy model.\nThe impact of the new parameterizations on the modelled dynamics of the sub-canopy snowpack is analysed and yields consistent results, but the frequent occurrence of mixed-precipitation events at Alptal prevents a conclusive assessment of model performances against snow data.\nWithout specific tuning, the model is also able to reproduce the measured summertime tree trunk temperatures and biomass heat storage at the boreal site of Norunda, Sweden, with an increased accuracy in amplitude and phase.\nOverall, the SNOWPACK model with its enhanced canopy module constitutes a unique (in its physical process representation) atmosphere-to-soil-through-canopy-and-snow modelling chain.",

            "abstract": "We present evidence of a transition from connected to unconnected non-wetting phase flow during drainage in CO2-brine and N2-water core floods. Connected non-wetting phase flow is controlled by heterogeneity in the pore space, with non-wetting phase pathways developing in regions of lower capillary entry pressure. During unconnected non-wetting phase flow, pore space heterogeneity has no impact on fluid flow paths and relative permeability is controlled by fluid properties such as interfacial tension. The transition is observed through a shift in relative permeability curves, maps of steady state saturation and fluid arrangement during relative permeability measurements, and pore scale observations. The transition can be achieved either by modifying the pressure, temperature and salinity conditions of a core flood to increase the wetting phase viscosity, or by increasing the wetting or non-wetting phase flow rate. We suggest the viscous pressure in the wetting phase has a strong impact on the flow behaviour and fluid arrangement during multiphase flow, even at conditions where the flow is traditionally considered to be capillary dominated.\nFigure 1. Wetting and non-wetting phase capillary number [1] plotted for 7 CO2-brine and one N2-water core floods at temperatures and pressures of 38-91°C and 10.3-20.7 MPa and brine molalities of 0-5 mol kg-1. Saturation maps at a steady state saturation of Sw = 56 % are shown for connected and disconnected non-wetting phase flow. Non-wetting phase relative permeability changes from low endpoint at high irreducible water saturation during connected flow to a high end point relative permeability and low irreducible water saturation during disconnected non-wetting phase flow.\n[1] Datta, S.

It was found at the 3rd leg of the 2009 Chinese DY115-21 expedition on board R/V Dayangyihao.\nIt is efficient to learn the distribution of hydrothermal plumes and locate the hydrothermal vents by detecting the anomalies of turbidity and temperature. Detecting seawater turbidity by MAPR based on deep-tow technology is established and improved during our cruises. We collected data recorded by MAPR and information from geological sampling, yielding the following results:\n(1)Strong hydrothermal turbidity and temperature anomalies were recorded at 1.23°N, southeast and northwest of PSMHF. According to the CTD data on the mooring system, significant temperature anomalies were observed over PSMHF at the depth of 1,470 m, with anomalies range from 0.2℃ to 0.4℃, which gave another evidence of the existence of hydrothermal plume.\n(2)At 1.23°N (101.4802°W/1.2305°N), the nose-shaped particle plume was concentrated at a depth interval of 1,400-1,600 m, with 200 m thickness and an east-west diffusion range of 500 m. The maximum turbidity anomaly (0.045 △NTU) was recorded at the depth of 1,500 m, while the background anomaly was about 0.01△NTU. A distinct temperature anomaly was also detected at the seafloor near 1.23°N. Deep-tow camera showed the area was piled up by hydrothermal sulfide sediments.\n(3) In the southeast (101.49°W/1.21°N), the thickness of hydrothermal plume was 300 m and it was spreading laterally at a depth of 1,500-1,800 m, for a distance about 800 m. The maximum turbidity anomaly of nose-shaped plume is about 0.04 △NTU at the depth of 1,600 m. Distinct temperature anomaly was also detected in the northwest (101.515°W/1.235°N).\n(4) Terrain and bottom current were the main factors controlling the distribution of hydrothermal plume. Different from the distribution of hydrothermal plumes on the mid-ocean ridges, which was mostly effected by seafloor topography, the terrain of the PSMHF was relatively flat, so the impact was negligible. Southwest direction bottom current at the speed of 0.05 m/s in PSMHF had a great influence on the distribution and spreading direction of hydrothermal plume.\nKeyword: hydrothermal plume, Precious Stone Mountain hydrothermal field, turbidity",

            "abstract": "The highest gas hydrate saturations and possible energy resource targets are bound to sandy sediments. However, investigations regarding the influence of natural sand particles on gas hydrate formation are rare and almost missing with regards to the particle size effect of different grain size ranges of sand on the gas hydrate kinetics. Comparative investigations commonly use arbitrary sized sands and clay minerals. In addition, sand grains are often represented using glass beads or pure quartz grains instead of natural samples where additional effects from mineral compositions and coatings might occur. However, understanding the kinetics of hydrate formation in sand forms yet another foundation for a successful scale-up model of the production of natural gas hydrate reservoirs, where reformation of hydrates may occur under non-equilibrium conditions.\nWe investigated the particle size effect of sand on methane hydrate formation kinetics using five different grain size ranges of Ottawa sand, a rather pure quartz sand. Conditions of the static and small-volume experiments were far within the methane hydrate stability (7 MPa/1°C). Pressure and temperature recording as well as microscopic and Raman spectroscopic observations could verify methane hydrate formation and growth.\nFor the chosen experimental setup there is a strong particle size effect on the kinetics of gas hydrate formation. A high concentration of the finest range (< 125µm) has led to an explicitly faster hydrate formation compared to coarser sand or a small fraction of fine particles diluted in coarse sand grains. This is in contrast to the decrease of thermodynamic driving forces in the presence of fine sized particles given equilibrium conditions. The promoting kinetic effect of the mineral surface properties might be related to the impact of the surface area as well as crystal structures, and/or electrical charge since small fractions of natural sands commonly encounter different mineral compositions compared to the coarser, quartz rich sand fraction. Therefore, additional investigations focus on the influence of the different minerals on the hydrate formation process.",

            "abstract": "Quantitative modeling of flow and transport through fractured geological media is challenging due to the inaccessibility of the underlying medium properties and the complex interplay between heterogeneity and small scale transport processes such as heterogeneous advection, matrix diffusion, hydrodynamic dispersion and adsorption. This complex interplay leads to anomalous (non-Fickian) transport behavior, the origin of which remains a matter of debate: whether it arises from variability in fracture permeability (velocity heterogeneity), connectedness in the fracture network (velocity correlation), or interaction between fractures and matrix. Here we show that this uncertainty of heterogeneity- vs. correlation-controlled transport can be resolved by combining convergent and push-pull tracer tests because flow reversibility is strongly dependent on correlation, whereas late-time scaling of breakthrough curves is mainly controlled by heterogeneity. We build on this insight, and propose a Lagrangian statistical model that takes the form of a continuous time random walk (CTRW) with correlated particle velocities. In this framework, flow heterogeneity and flow correlation are quantified by a Markov process of particle transition times that is characterized by a distribution function and a transition probability. Our transport model captures the anomalous behavior in the breakthrough curves for both push-pull and convergent flow geometries, with the same set of parameters. We validate our model in the Ploemeur observatory in France. Thus, the proposed correlated CTRW modeling approach provides a simple yet powerful framework for characterizing the impact of flow correlation and heterogeneity on transport in fractured media.",

            "abstract": "Northern wetlands have the potential to become major sources of greenhouse gases. Detailed and accurate maps of the locations, types, and extents of these wetlands are therefore essential to the development of accurate carbon budgets. However, due to their vast extent and inaccessibility, most northern wetlands remain unmapped.\nWe have been constructing high-resolution (100 m) thematic maps of boreal wetlands, with current focus on Canadian wetlands. The maps are developed using spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR), which efficiently collects high-resolution imagery over extensive regions and, unlike optical sensors, is unimpaired by clouds or lack of sunlight. Spaceborne L-band (~1.3 GHz) SAR, in particular, records scene characteristics imperceptible to optical sensors such as vegetation structure and moisture content, soil moisture and roughness, and canopy-obscured surface waters. These attributes make it the best single tool for mapping boreal wetlands.\nTwo L-band SAR-based wetland maps are being assembled: one using HH-polarized imagery from the JERS-1 satellite collected in the winter and summer of 1997-1998, and a second using dual-polarized (HH and HV) imagery from the PALSAR sensor of the ALOS satellite collected in the summer of 2008. Ancillary data layers such as image texture, topographic slope, and proximity to water are also generated, and a training/testing data layer is formed by merging polygons from the Canadian Wetland Inventory (CWI) with other land cover databases. A Random Forests decision tree classifier takes as input the SAR, ancillary, and training/testing data layers and uses them to produce thematic wetland maps. The accuracy of each map is quantified via producer and user error statistics. Finally, the SAR-based wetland maps are compared to form a 1998-2008 wetlands change map.\nRecent advances include a powerful new software suite developed to handle huge volumes of data and much-improved JERS-1 registration. Challenges, including non-GIS-ready CWI data and nonstructural CWI class definitions, are being addressed.\nThis work was carried out in part within the ALOS Kyoto & Carbon Initiative at the University of Southern California and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) under contract to NASA. JERS-1 mosaics were generated by JPL. PALSAR mosaics were provided by JAXA/EORC.",

            "abstract": "Geonet is responsible for providing information on the geological hazard events including about 15,000 earthquakes recorded by the New Zealand seismograph network per year. Such large numbers of earthquakes confirm the importance of having an accurate P-phase picker in order to find automatic solutions for hypocenters and reduce analyst’s time needed to produce the reviewed catalogs. Geonet uses an Autoregressive-Akaike Information Criterion P-phase picker to estimate the P-phase onsets from the Butterworth filtered waveforms. We studied efficiency of the P-phase picker using waveforms of 3312 shallow earthquakes of the Matata swarms in 2007-2010. For stations EDRZ and URZ with large contributions to the Geonet locator, 48.80% and 32.88% of waveforms were reviewed by analysts. Such high rates of reviewed onsets indicated the need to improve the automatic phase picking’s performance. To do so, we replaced the Butterworth filtering with the Wavelet Scale Thresholding (WST) and divided the re-estimated onsets into the “unchanged”, “revised”, “retrieved” and “adversely affected” classes. We studied effect of the Mexican hat and Haar WST on the P-phase picker’s performance using quality control parameters including total and net improvements, onset corrections, picking errors and picking quality enhancement. Applying the Mexican hat WST mainly on scales 1 and 2 to the EDRZ recordings of chosen events resulted in large percentages for average total improvement (64.79%) and onset retrieval (31.95%) in 2007-2010. Efficiency of the Mexican hat WST at the URZ station was represented by small average retrieval of 2.76%, total and net improvement rates of 35.17% and 17.58% respectively. The small retrieval rate should be due the deep-borehole installation that filters the ambient noise and hence improves the quality of recordings. In spite of the reduced noise, path and site effects at the URZ station, the contribution of the Mexican hat WST to the quality enhancement of the picked onsets with the average rate of 26.28% during 2007-2010 indicated the efficiency of the alternative filtering scheme.",

            "abstract": "Climate projections depend on scenarios of fossil fuel emissions and land use change, and the IPCC AR5 parallel process assumes consistent climate scenarios across Integrated Assessment and Earth System Models (IAMs and ESMs). The CMIP5 project used a novel “land use harmonization” based on the Global Land use Model (GLM) to provide ESMs with consistent 1500-2100 land use trajectories generated by historical data and four IAM projections. A direct coupling of the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), GLM, and the Community ESM (CESM) has allowed us to characterize and partially address a major gap in the CMIP5 land coupling design: the lack of a corresponding land cover harmonization. The CMIP5 CESM global afforestation is only 22% of GCAM’s 2005 to 2100 RCP4.5 afforestation. Likewise, only 17% of GCAM’s 2040 RCP4.5 afforestation, and zero pasture loss, were transmitted to CESM within the directly coupled model. This is a problem because afforestation was relied upon to achieve RCP4.5 climate stabilization. GLM modifications within the directly coupled model did not increase CESM afforestation. Modifying the CESM land use translator in addition to GLM, however, enabled CESM to simulate 66% of GCAM’s afforestation in 2040, and 94% of GCAM’s pasture loss as grassland and shrubland losses. This additional afforestation increases vegetation carbon gain by 19 PgC and decreases atmospheric CO2 gain by 8 ppmv from 2005 to 2040, implying different RCP4.5 climate scenarios between CMIP5 GCAM and CESM. Although the IAMs and ESMs were not expected to have exactly the same climate forcing, due in part to different terrestrial carbon cycles and atmospheric radiation algorithms, the ESMs were expected to project climates representative of the RCP scenarios. Similar land cover inconsistencies exist in other CMIP5 model results, primarily because land cover information is not shared between IAM and ESM models. High RCP4.5 afforestation might also contribute to inconsistencies as some ESMs might impose bioclimatic limits to potential forest area and have different rates of forest growth than projected by RCP4.5. Further work to harmonize land cover among models will be required to address this problem.",

            "abstract": "Lake sediments are hotspots for carbon (C) cycling, acting both as sinks and sources through C burial and production of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane. The fate of this CO2 in the water column is controlled by bottom water turbulence, a factor not accounted for in current estimates of sediment CO2 fluxes.\nThis study is aimed to quantify the turbulent CO2 flux across the sediment-water interface (SWI) by measuring the oxygen (O2) flux with the non-invasive Eddy Correlation (EC) method that combines measurements of 3D velocity (ADV) and O2 fluctuations with a microsensor. Using the metabolic relation (respiratory quotient, RQ) of O2 and CO2 derived from a sediment incubation experiment we present the first estimates of turbulent lake sediment CO2 flux from two boreal lakes in Sweden (Erssjön and Erken, 0.07 km2 and 23.7 km2 respectively).\nOnly ~10 % of the total dataset was extracted for flux calculations due to poor signal-to-noise ratio in the velocity and O2 signals. The sediment in Lake Erssjön was both consuming and producing O2, related to bacterial respiration and photosynthesis. Mean O2 flux was -0.19 and 0.17 μmol O2 m-2 sec-1, comparing to 0.04 μmol O2 m-2 sec-1 derived from the sediment incubation experiment. Fluxes for Lake Erken are still to be determined. Experimentally derived RQ of the both lake sediments were close to unity implying that in-situ CO2 fluxes are of similar magnitude as O2 fluxes, varying between -0.15 and 0.18 μmol C m-2 sec-1.\nThe first measurement of turbulent sediment O2 flux and estimate of turbulent CO2 flux from a small boreal lake show higher and more variable fluxes than previously found in experimental studies. The low amount of data extracted for flux calculations (~10%) point towards the difficulties in EC measurement in low-turbulence environments. On-going work focuses on the turbulence structure in lakes and its influence on the gas fluxes at the SWI.",

PA (Process Analysis) in the CMAQ (Community Multiscale Air Quality Model) is a probing tool to identify the formation pathways of the ozone.\nCMAQ with the HDDM and PA was used to simulate the high peak ozone concentrations in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) for 2009. The predicted ozone concentrations by CMAQ were compared with observations at air quality monitoring stations in the SMA. The results showed that the model could depict observed diurnal variations of ozone concentration but it had a tendency of underestimating the ozone peak concentration. One of the main reasons for such discrepancies is due to uncertainties of precursor emissions of NOx and VOCs. The main processes inducing peak ozone were the horizontal transport and gas phase chemistry according to the PA.\nIn order to improve capacity of prediction high peak ozone concentration, sensitivity test of the precursor emissions on ozone formation using HDDM was carried out to determine which emission of VOCs and NOx is a controlling one in the ozone formation. The results showed that the ozone concentrations increased with VOCs emissions and decreased with NOx emission, which implies the VOC-limited region.

Dense geothermal observations were conducted using Hi-net boreholes (Matsumoto, 2007). By considering a thermal structure based on the dense geothermal observations, we model the stress state of the northeastern Japan island-arc crust using a finite element method with viscoelasticity and elastoplasticity. We consider realistic petrological structures of the upper crust, lower crust, and uppermost mantle to define flow properties. We apply an E–W contraction as a boundary condition. We reproduce several elongate low-stress regions as shown in the figure, where brittle-ductile transition zones are shallow, striking transverse to the arc with viscous deformation. These low-stress regions correspond to hot fingers (high-temperature regions in the mantle wedge, indicated by white lines in the figure). Regions with seismicity correspond to regions with high stress accumulation outside of the hot fingers and many intraplate earthquakes occur within these regions.\nThe viscous relaxation process after the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake could have been affected by the existence of low-viscosity regions caused by the hot fingers. A finite element model is developed to investigate the viscoelastic deformation processes after the earthquake, which consider the realistic crustal and mantle structures, viscoelasticity, and coseismic fault slip distribution (Iinuma et al., 2012). We also consider the realistic 3D heterogeneous viscosity distribution in the crust and the upper mantle beneath the northeastern Japan island arc. Our numerical results indicate that significant extensional viscous deformation occurrs in the low-viscosity regions in the hot fingers. This affects the crustal movements in the inland area significantly.",

We used arrival time data from local, regional and teleseismic stations. For the inversion procedure, we have applied 1-D and 3-D seismic velocity models to determine earthquake hypocenter location. Our relocation results show that the travel-time RMS errors were greatly reduced. The hypocenter locations distribution shows significantly improved locations after the relocation. The relocated hypocenters also exhibit improvement in hypocenter depths particularly for shallow earthquakes. Overall, our relocation results were well correlated with tectonic features in this region, e.g. major subduction zones beneath Sumatra, Java, Bali, Banda, Sulawesi and Molluca and inland fault zones such as the Sumatra faut zone.

High levels of soil salinity adversely affect plant growth and productivity, soil and water quality, and may eventually result in soil erosion and land degradation. Being essentially a hazard, it’s important to monitor and map soil salinity at an early stage to effectively use soil resources and maintain soil salinity level below the salt tolerance of crops. In this respect, low frequency electromagnetic induction (EMI) systems can be used as a noninvasive method to map the distribution of soil salinity at the field scale and at a high spatial resolution.\nIn this contribution, an EMI system (the CMD Mini-Explorer) is used to estimate soil salinity using a Bayesian approach implemented via a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling for inversion of multi-configuration EMI measurements. In-situ and EMI measurements were conducted across a farm where Acacia trees are irrigated with brackish water using a drip irrigation system. The electromagnetic forward model is based on the full solution of Maxwell's equation, and the subsurface is considered as a three-layer problem. In total, five parameters (electrical conductivity of three layers and thickness of top two layers) were inverted and modeled electrical conductivities were converted into the universal standard of soil salinity measurement (i.e. using the method of electrical conductivity of a saturated soil paste extract). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme successfully recovers soil salinity and reduces the uncertainties in the prior estimate. Analysis of the resulting posterior distribution of parameters indicates that electrical conductivity of the top two layers and the thickness of the first layer are well constrained by the EMI measurements. The proposed approach allows for quantitative mapping and monitoring of the spatial electrical conductivity variations and can be utilized for the management of soil salinity.",

            "abstract": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a powerful imaging technique for measuring ground deformation, either through Interferometric SAR (InSAR) or image offset tracking. However, these methods are only applied to SAR images acquired by the same satellite, which limits the measurement capability for many earthquakes. Here we propose a novel approach that allows for calculating offsets between images acquired from the European ERS and Envisat satellites. To achieve this cross-sensor offset calculation, we first coregister pre-event (ERS) and post-event (Envisat) SAR images separately to generate averaged pre- and post-event SAR amplitude maps. We then compute the orbital offsets between these two maps in order to resample the ERS average map onto the grid of the averaged Envisat image. We finally calculate the cross-sensor image offsets based on cross-correlating selected sub-images distributed throughout the coregistered averaged SAR maps. Application to the 2001 Bhuj earthquake reveals, for the first time, its near-field coseismic displacement field right above the epicenter. We compare our measurements with the surface displacement field predicted from the published source model of Copley et al. [2011]. This model was derived from tele-seismic waveforms and limited far-field geodetic data. The comparison between the two displacement maps shows consistent displacement patterns, yet a systematic shift, which likely is due to the limited near-fault resolution of the data used in the previous model. We then perform a joint inversion using the newly derived SAR image offsets and tele-seismic waveforms. The preferred source model suggests a compact slip pattern at depths of 20-30 km with a peak slip of ~10 meters and a fairly short rise time (<3s). The large slip rate and low attenuation in the crust are likely responsible for the widely felt ground shaking despite of its compact source area. The result demonstrates that it is possible to correlate non-coherent SAR images acquired by different sensors to measure surface displacements. This approach extends further the possibility of mining the archive of SAR images for various types of earth-science studies.",

            "abstract": "In a past presentation, a description was made of the process that led to the determination of the azimuth for the arrival of electromagnetic pulses sensed by magnetometers of the Peru-Magneto network. Through triangulation using information from nearby stations in the network, the source of pressure, identified by the motion of positive charges produced locally and leading to currents has been identified. Such mechanical pressure points have been processed in a pseudo mechanical analogue of the centroid, called the EM-centroid as the source of pre-earthquake stress that leads to rupture and possibly to earthquakes, when the ruptures can be sensed in a seismic or cause-effect way.. Thus, for certain areas of Peru, like the central coast or the south, we have been able to detect 8 EQs and many more are tectonic-wise related to possibly connected EM-pulse sources, in less than a year time period.\nWith the above described scheme, the point has been reached where, for some areas in Central and Southern Peru under certain conditions, \"when\" and \"where\" an earthquake will occur can be known most of the time. The possibility of determining the magnitude is not so straight forward, since not all EM pulses end up in a rupture and besides, the magnitude of the seismic event depends on the extension of the rupture area and this on the strain, the rock structure, the depth and not only on the stress. Estimates of the areas and connected rupture possibilities are analyzed from magnetometers donated through the collaboration of Quakefinder and the results will be shown on videos as animated presentations of occurrence events in time, for several earthquakes in 2013 and 2014.",

            "abstract": "We have been monitoring the water quality in the Kiryu Experimental Watershed (KEW; 5.99 ha), Japan, and four subcatchments for more than 20 years. The climate of KEW is warm temperate. The artificially planted Japanese Cypress around 1960 covers whole of the KEW. The geology of KEW is weathered granite.\nThe concentrations of SiO2 and Na, which are mainly supplied from weathering processes, in streamwater were different between the catchments, and the difference was controlled by hydrological conditions in each catchment; in the catchment where shallow groundwater contribution to the streamflow is large, the concentrations were lower. Conversely, in the catchment where deep, bedrock groundwater contribution is large, these concentrations were higher. The K+ concentration which cycles between soil and plants showed clear seasonal variations and the differences between the catchments were small.\nConsidering the long-term trend of streamwater chemistry, the electric conductivity (EC), Cl-, and SO42- concentrations have been gradually decreasing during recent 10 years in all catchments. On the other hand, the NO3- concentration has been commonly increasing in recent 5 years in all catchment. The difference of concentrations between the catchments were depending on the difference of the redox condition caused by soil sediment. One of the subcatchments experienced the disturbance in early 90’s and subsequent increase of NO3- concentration, and the residence tine distribution shows the effects of the disturbance is still remaining. Recently, the disturbance is expanding in another subcatchment, and one of the reason of the disturbance is soil erosion. Moreover, the streamwater NO3- concentrations are also gradually increasing even in undisturbed catchments. These facts imply that this 50-year-old unmanaged artificial forest may start degrading, and the biogeochemical cycle may start changing.\nThe long-term dynamics of streamwater chemistry is a good diagnosis tool of the ecosystem. Therefore, it is important to continue the monitoring and to consider the mechanisms. We will discuss about the mechanisms and the differences between adjacent subcatchments considering the water quality of the precipitation and the groundwater as well as the hydrological parameters at the coming meeting.",

            "abstract": "The Elbe paleo valley is the most prominent subsurface structure in the southern North Sea (~10,000 km²) and constitutes an important part of Germany’s largest marine Natura 2000-Reserve “Sylter Außenriff” (European environmental protection area). It is supposed that the valley was formed by epeirogenic movement during the Tertiary. The depression developed to its present form during the Weichselian sea-level lowstand (‑130 m below present). Melt waters that discharged in north-westerly directions fed the paleo Elbe at that time. During the Holocene the valley drowned in the rising sea. A narrow raster of new shallow seismic data combined with high resolution sidescan sonar data is used to shed new light on the Holocene development of the paleo Elbe valley and its adjacent regions in detail. Cross sections distributed with transect distances of 400 and 800 m, respectively, over a length of 100 km (approximately one third of the total valley length) enable a good comprehensive analysis of the historical process of sedimentary valley infill and coastal evolution with the successive Holocene sea level rise.\nThe eastern flank of the valley is characterized by a relatively steep slope with one or more terraces, representing moraine deposits which are today still present at the seafloor surface, partly covered with Holocene marine deposits. The western slip-off slope of the valley is much smoother than the eastern undercut slope. West of the valley, sediment cores show peat and tidal flat sediments. Shallow seismic data show the base of the valley. There are conspicuous internal seismic reflectors above the base, inclined in northeastern direction. They indicate a sedimentary infill of the valley from the southwest when the southern part of the Dogger Bank was flooded during the early Holocene sea-level rise. In this process the steeper eastern slope acted as a natural barrier towards the northeast, averted sediment transport beyond the eastern boundary of the paleo Elbe valley and represents the coastline of the former North Sea.",

            "abstract": "Dams interrupt the downstream transport of sediment in rivers, accumulating sediment in the reservoir and depriving downstream reaches of their natural sediment load, with serious consequences for many deltas where lack of sediment supply has contributed to accelerated subsidence and coastal erosion. From the Indus to the Yellow, major Asian rivers are undergoing unprecedented rates of dam construction. On the Mekong, 7 dams are under construction on the mainstem in China and 133 proposed (or already built) for the Lower Mekong River and tributaries. Given its naturally high sediment loads (owing to its active tectonism), we can ask how much sediment will these dams trap, how will sedimentation affect reservoir sustainability, and how will sediment trapping deprive downstream reaches of their natural sediment loads and thus create problems of ‘hungry water’ in downstream channels and the delta. The question has been difficult to answer before because of the lack of sediment data for critical tributaries and uncertainties even for the better-documented mainstem. To overcome the lack of data, we adopted a geomorphic approach, delineating nine distinct regions for which we estimated sediment yields based on geomorphic characteristics, tectonic history, and the limited sediment transport data available. We used the 3-W model to estimate cumulative sediment trapping by these dams, accounting for changing trap efficiency over time and multiple dams on a single river system. Under a 38-dam ‘definite future’ scenario, cumulative sediment reduction to the Delta would be 51%. Under full build-out of all planned dams, cumulative sediment trapping would be 96%, ultimately depriving the Delta of nearly all its sediment load. This scenario would have profound consequences on productivity of the river and persistence of the Delta landform itself, and suggests that strategies to pass sediment through/around dams should be urgently explored to prevent or reduce the consequences of downstream sediment starvation.",

            "abstract": "The outer or irregular moons belong to the by far most numerous, but least investigated group of moons in the Saturnian system. The group is comprised of at least 38, mainly small objects which orbit at quite large distances to the planet, the rings, the inner regular moon system, and the Cassini spacecraft. As seen from Earth, their apparent visual magnitudes mainly range from ~20 to >25, the phase angles from 0 to 6°. From Cassini, some irregular moons can reach <12th mag, while most are at least occasionally brighter than ~16.5 mag. Their phase angles can assume any value from 0 to 180°.\nThe Cassini ISS camera regularly observed the irregular moons over the last few years at various phase angles, with this research program now also being part of an accepted Participating Scientist proposal. Because of the large distances, the objects appear as unresolved point sources to the ISS. By means of photometric time series, rotational periods and minimum equatorial-axis ratios (a/b)min for 21 out of the 38 known objects could be determined. The rotation periods range from ~5½ hours for Hati to ~3 days for Tarqeq (Fig. top row). The largest (a/b)min are 2.9 for Kiviuq and 1.7 for Erriapus and Bestla (Fig. middle row).\nMany objects are subject of repeated observations under varying illumination and viewing geometries, with the aim of determining pole-axis directions, convex-hull shapes, and sidereal periods. So far, lightcurve inversion of Ymir revealed a convex shape reminiscent to a triangular prism and a spin-axis direction close to the South Ecliptic pole. The figure shows the lightcurve at 64° phase (bottom left panel), and four equatorial and two polar views of the derived shape model are shown at bottom right.\nWithin Cassini's final three years in Saturn orbit, further observations offer the potential of pole and shape determinations for up to 15 irregular moons and up to 30 rotational periods total. These data may reveal (or already do so) hemispherical color variations, limits for object densities and sizes, pole-direction patterns, correlations of spin frequencies to orbit parameters, and hints for contact binaries or binary natures of the moons. Such information, besides its value per se, provides constraints for the investigation on the formation and evolutionary processes within the Saturnian satellite system.",

We examined changes in extreme precipitation events under the projected future climate in India from regional and global climate models. We obtained CMIP5 projections for 32 general circulation models (GCMs), while data for regional climate models (RCMs) were obtained from the CORDEX South Asia program. The data were analyzed for the historic (1971-1999) and projected future climate (2006-2060) for annual maximum precipitation, frequency of extreme precipitation events, mean intensity of top five precipitation events, and ratio of heavy to non-heavy precipitation. Out of the 32 GCMs, we selected the four best GCMs (BEST-GCMs) that performed better for extreme precipitation events in India. Moreover, we selected the host GCMs (HOST-GCMs) that were used as a boundary condition for the CORDEX-RCMs. We finally compared projections of extreme precipitation events from the BEST-GCMs, HOST-GCMs, and CORDEX-RCMs under the future climate. We find that the CORDEX-RCMs show a large inter-model variation leading to a high uncertainty in projections. Overall, most of the models indicate increases in extreme precipitation events under the projected future climate predominantly in the Southern peninsula.",

Driven by the centrifugal force, this plasma will move radially outward. As such, the frozen-in condition implies that the magnetic flux will also be advected outward. Therefore, conservation of magnetic flux requires a magnetic flux refilling mechanism. One of the plausible mechanisms is magnetic reconnection. As a first step to quantitatively approach this question, we investigated the Rayleigh–Taylor instability (RTI) by using a three-dimensional MHD simulation. In this presentation, we will demonstrate two types of magnetic reconnection driven by the RTI corresponding to different magnetic configurations, and discuss their applications to the giant magnetospheres.",

            "abstract": "Extratropical cyclones often develop rapidly in the cold season, called explosive cyclones, cause wide-ranging heavy snowfall and strong winds, which make enormous impacts on lifelines; the damage to electric power cables, the cancellation of flights, ships and trains, traffic jams, and so on. Severe snowstorms associated with explosive cyclones occasionally cause sudden whiteouts, resulting in fatal accidents. Therefore, elucidating processes causing such a sudden change in weather leads to the improvement of weather forecast and disaster prevention in the cold season.\nAn extratropical cyclone occurred over the Japan Sea on March 1 2013 and passed through the Hokkaido Island in Japan developing rapidly, and then peaked over the Sea of Okhotsk on March 3, which is classified into an explosive cyclone according to the rapid deepening rate of the surface central pressure of the cyclone. The severe snowstorm associated with the explosive cyclone caused a sudden whiteout in the eastern part of the Hokkaido Island and killed nine people on March 2.\nTo investigate the mechanism of the sudden whiteout by the severe snowstorm, numerical simulations are performed using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The control simulation with the realistic topography (denoted as CNTL) successfully reproduces the track and evolution of the cyclone, the distribution of strong winds associated with the severe snowstorm, and the sudden change in weather in the eastern part of Hokkaido. To examine orographic effects on the sudden change in weather, an additional simulation, in which the Hokkaido topography is modified into a flat, (denoted as HOK-FLAT) is performed. A comparison of the low-level geopotential and wind distributions between CNTL and HOK-FLAT clearly shows the barrier effects due to the Hokkaido topography. The positive geopotential anomaly generated on the upstream side of the topography in the CNTL simulation rapidly shifts strong winds eastward and also enhances the strong winds.",

            "abstract": "To diagnose sedimentation environments through the geologic time, two sediments cores were recovered in the Northeast equatorial Pacific (PC120201: 9°57ʹN and 131°42ʹW in 5,080 m water depth; KODOS 02-01-02: 16°12ʹN and 125°59ʹW in 4,550 m water depth). Successive AF demagnetization reveals a well constrained characteristic component between AF fields of 15–50 mT with the maximum angular deviation of <10°. The component flips eight times in PC120201 and three times in KODOS 02-01-02 showing distinctive antipodal declination and inclination. In the reference geologic time scale, the eight and three reversal events correspond to the age of about 4.5 Ma and 1.8 Ma, respectively. However, 10Be based age correction shows 13.4 Ma at 465 cm depth in PC120201 and variable sedimentation rates of 0.1–2.44 mm/kyr, indicating many of magnetic reversal records are buried. In KODOS 02-01-02, rock-magnetic properties (i.e., magnetic concentration, grain size, and mineralogy) above 250 cm, composed of siliceous ooze and pelagic red clay, show gradual down-core increase of magnetic concentration and grain size. Such variation is well correlated with the down-core variation to 215 cm of PC120201. From the correlation, the estimated age at 215 cm depth of KODOS 02-01-02 is ~7 Ma and a sedimentation rate is ~0.36 mm/kyr. At this time, we test the possibility of rock-magnetic properties as an alternative age dating tool for deep-sea sediments. When detailed mineralogical data are complemented, rock-magnetic properties will answer the question about sediments provenance in spatial and temporal terms.",

Modelling the climate change of the Maritime Continent is particularly challenge, showing a high degree of uncertainty. Compared to other regions, model agreement of future projections in response to anthropogenic emission forcings is much less. Furthermore, the spatial and temporal behaviors of climate projections seem to vary significantly due to a complex geographical condition and a wide range of scale interactions. For the fine-scale climate information (27 km) suitable for representing the complexity of climate change over the Maritime Continent, dynamical downscaling is performed using the MIT regional climate model (MRCM) during two thirty-year period for reference (1970-1999) and future (2070-2099) climate. Initial and boundary conditions are provided by Community Earth System Model (CESM) simulations under the emission scenarios projected by MIT Integrated Global System Model (IGSM). Changes in mean climate as well as the frequency and intensity of extreme climate events are investigated at various temporal and spatial scales. Our analysis is primarily centered on the different behavior of changes in convective and large-scale precipitation over land vs. ocean during dry vs. wet season. In addition, we attempt to find the added value to downscaled results over the Maritime Continent through the comparison between MRCM and CESM projection.\nAcknowledgements.\nThis research was supported by the National Research Foundation Singapore through the Singapore MIT Alliance for Research and Technology's Center for Environmental Sensing and Modeling interdisciplinary research program.",

Two types of antennas, channel-1 and channel-2, with different resolutions were equipped on the LPR, which detected the lunar subsurface structure with low frequency and the thickness of regolith with high frequency, respectively. We focus on the study of the lunar subsurface structure using channel-1 data. Considering the propagation characteristics of radar wave, the processing of amplitude compensation and filtering are applied to improve the imaging quality, and the processed profile clearly represents deeper than 300 meters of layered information.\nBased on the geological background around landing site, we present the preliminary geological interpretation for the lunar subsurface structure. More than 5 obvious reflecting events should be concerned along the track of the Yutu rover, which infer different lava sequences, including the Eratosthenian basalts, paleo-regolith formed between Eratosthenian and Imbrium, and multistage infilled lavas formed inter-layers among the Imbrium basalts.",

            "abstract": "Satellite remote sensing is a powerful tool for understanding many of oceanic processes synoptically. The images provided by the ocean colour satellites are widely used in physical, biological and ecological aspects of oceanography, but the scaling properties of satellite images are too rarely studied. In the present work we aim to understand the scaling properties of the satellite ocean colour products obtained from the MODIS-Aqua using tools from turbulence. We identify some regions which experience high spatial heterogeneity in Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and Sea Surface Temperature (SST). We also study the remote sensing reflectance at two wavelengths (Rrs443 and Rrs555 nm) which has direct link to the phytoplankton biomass. We have selected four regions of various water types for the present methodology study. Here we use 1D and 2D Fourier power spectra to understand the spatial scaling of Rrs, Chl-a and SST. The 2D power specrum is derived from the radially averaged power spectrum of Rrs, Chl-a and SST. The power spectra derived for 1D and 2D follow power law behaviour with specific slope values, and it varies with region.\nThe multi-scaling properties of these images are also studied using the Structure Function (SF) and Coarse graining (CG) method. SF is analysed from the Rrs, Chl-a and SST maps and the CG is done using their gradient modulus. The moment scaling functions (ζ(q) for SF and K(q) for CG) are also derived for these images. Using simulations of 2D fBm, 2D beta model and lognormal cascades, we test both methods and show that, for nonstationary cascades (when the Hurst value is not zero) the CG method applied to the small scale laplacian field, is not adequate to characterize fully the image scaling statistics. The advantage of using the SF method is also that it can be applied to an instantaneous image with missing pixels, due to cloud coverage.\nKeywords: Power spectra, Scaling; Structure Function, Coarse graining, Multifractalilty, Beta model, Lognormal cascades ",

            "abstract": "The chasm between classroom science and scientific research is bridged in the History of Life Internships at Stanford University. The primary foci of the internships are collection of new scientific data and original scientific research. While traditional high school science courses focus on learning content and laboratory skills, students are rarely engaged in real scientific research. Even in experiential learning environments, students investigate phenomena with known outcomes under idealized conditions. In the History of Life Internships, high school youth worked full time during the summers of 2013 and 2014 to collect body size data on fossil Echinoderms and Ostracods, measuring more than 20,000 species in total. These data are contributed to the larger research efforts in the Stanford Paleobiology Lab, but they also serve as a source of data for interns to conduct their own scientific research. Over the course of eight weeks, interns learn about previous research on body size evolution, collect data, develop their own hypotheses, test their hypotheses, and communicate their results to their peers and the larger scientific community: the 2014 interns have submitted eight abstracts to this meeting for the youth session entitled Bright STaRS where they will present their research findings.\nBased on a post-internship survey, students in the 2013 History of Life cohort had more positive attitudes towards science and had a better understanding of how to conduct scientific research compared to interns in the Earth Sciences General Internship Program, where interns typically do not complete their own research project from start to finish. In 2014, we implemented both pre- and post-internship surveys to determine if these positive attitudes were developed over the course of the internship.\nConducting novel research inspires both the students and instructors. Scientific data collection often involves many hours of repetitive work, but answering big questions typically requires big datasets. Our team of 20 used calipers and data-rich compendia of fossil species to collect copious amounts of data. Our interns experienced the joys, frustrations, tedium and excitement of being scientists and discovering something new about the natural world for the first time.",

            "abstract": "A ~1.5‰ positive increase in deep-sea oxygen isotopic values marks the establishment of a continental-scale Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) at the Oi-1 event (~33.6 Ma) across the Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT). Quantifying the magnitude and timing of EOT AIS volume variations by means of δ18O records is hampered by the fact that the latter reflect a coupled signal of temperature and ice-sheet volume. Furthermore, bathymetric variations based on marine geologic sections are affected by large uncertainties and, most importantly, reflect the local response of relative sea level (rsl) to ice volume fluctuations rather than the global eustatic signal. AIS proximal and Northern Hemisphere (NH) shallow marine settings show, in fact, an opposite trend of rsl change across the EOT. In particular, low-latitude NH sequences record a 70 ± 20m rsl fall, suggesting that AIS volume could have expanded to either near modern dimensions or as much as 25% larger than present day. Conversely, sedimentary facies from shelf areas in the proximity of the AIS margins show that local rsl rose up to ~150 m during the EOT glaciation. In this work we reconcile near- and far-field rsl sites by solving the gravitationally self-consistent Sea Level Equation that accounts for Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA). Our GIA simulations show that the deviations from eustasy significantly increase towards Antarctica. Accordingly, the cyclo-chronological record of sedimentary cycles retrieved from Cape Roberts Project Drillcore CRP-3 indicates a deepening across the EOT. CRP-3 record also shows that full glacial conditions only occurred at the Oi-1a event (32.0 Ma). The strong gradients of rsl change around AIS result in heterogeneous bathymetric variations that might affect the circumpolar ocean flow. In fact, our novel GIA-forced ocean current model predicts along-meridian shifts of current frontal patterns of the order of several degrees. Also, differences in current velocity are locally more than 100%, and the zonal transport decreases in mean and variability. Our modeling results therefore suggest that GIA-induced ocean flow variations alone could have significant impacts on local nutrient variability as well as on erosion and sedimentation rates and ocean heat transport.",

Satellite remote sensing of XCO2 and XCH4 is an emerging tool which promises to supplement the traditional ground-based in-situ sampling approach by vast data coverage. The usefulness of XCO2 and XCH4measured by satellites such as GOSAT and OCO-2, however, crucially depends on precision and accuracy. Therefore, validation by ground-based remote sensing observations is of major importance.\nThe Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) has been designed to meet these validation needs. It covers a few tens of ground-based Fourier Transform Spectrometers operating at very high spectral resolution. Most of these instruments are located on continental regions especially in the northern hemisphere. However, oceanic regions are sparsely validated.\nIn the framework of the development of a robust, small and versatile spectrometer for harsh environments, we operated two instruments, a Fourier Transform Spectrometer (EM27/SUN by Bruker) and a custom-built grating spectrometer aboard the German research vessel Polarstern.\nHere, we will present and discuss instrument performance as well as the retrieved XCO2 and XCH4 mixing ratios along the ship track from Capetown (SA) to Bremerhaven (GER) during the 5-week cruise in March 2014.

            "abstract": "Mode waters play an important role in interannual climate variability through the temporary storage of heat and carbon in the ocean. The mechanisms explaining their formation are not well understood but appear to be shaped by the dynamics of the ocean fronts that mark their poleward extent. We explore a mode water formation mechanism that has a clear connection to fronts and involves cabbeling. Cabbeling refers to the process by which two water masses of equal density but different temperature and salinity are combined to create a new, denser water mass, as a result of nonlinearities in the equation of state for seawater. The work is motivated in part by recent observations of an extremely sharp, density-compensated front at the north wall of the Gulf Stream, the boundary between the subtropical and subpolar gyres. Here, the inter-gyre salinity/temperature difference is compressed into a span of a few kilometers, making the flow susceptible to cabbeling. The sharpness of the front is caused by frontogenetic strain, which is presumably balanced by submesoscale lateral mixing processes. We study this balance with a simple analytical model of a thermohaline front forced by uniform strain and derive a scaling for the amount of water mass transformation resulting from the ensuing cabbeling. The theory suggests that this mechanism could be responsible for persistent, hence significant, mode water formation. As such, it represents a submesoscale process that impacts the ocean on basin scales that should be resolved or parameterized in realistic numerical simulations.",

            "abstract": "The study area is an industrial site (in the North of Italy) contaminated through heavy metal and chlorinated hydrocarbons. The site presents an area of about 5 km2 and a complex geology. During 2013 and 2014 the hydrogeological conceptual model was reviewed and the result was a main unconfined aquifer that presents an impervious bottom at about 30 m below ground. A small portion of the aquifer is split by a non-continuous aquitard. Below the impervious bottom, there are confined aquifers that are not polluted. The boundary conditions of the aquifer are constant head upstream (obtained from a regional piezometry) and constant head downstream that represents a lake stage. Moreover a river inside the study area, that could feed or dry the aquifer depending on its stage, manages the groundwater head levels. The study area presents more than 100 pumping wells that have the objective of realizing a hydraulic barrier and to prevent the flow of pollutants downstream. The area is monitored with about 120 monitoring wells, which are used, through a periodic sampling and monitoring, to control the pollution and to estimate the flow direction. During the last year a numerical flow model has been developed by means of MODFLOW 2000 (Harbaugh, 2000) with the aim at becoming a management tool of the hydraulic barrier. The calibration procedure, initially, was performed in steady state condition using the PEST procedure (Doherty, 2007). The goal was to reproduce the monthly observations at the monitoring wells varying the hydraulic conductivity of the main aquifer and of the aquitard. The second step of the calibration was the extension of the calibration to transient data. The period from September 1st 2013 to June 31st 2014 was reproduced. In order to avoid problem with the starting conditions only the observations collected in 2014 were used to estimate the aquifer parameters. The period September 1st 2013 to December 31st was used as warm up in order to obtain reliable starting conditions for the 2014. The result of the work was a model that allows to reproduce with high reliability the collected observations and to understand the groundwater flow direction depending on the river stage.",

            "abstract": "The Australian Solar Energy Forecasting System (ASEFS) project requires forecasting timeframes which range from nowcasting to long-term forecasts (minutes to two years). As concentrating solar power (CSP) plant operators are one of the key stakeholders in the national energy market, research and development enhancements for direct normal irradiance (DNI) forecasts is a major subtask. This project involves comparing different radiative scheme codes to improve day ahead DNI forecasts on the national supercomputing infrastructure running mesoscale simulations on NOAA’s Weather Research & Forecast (WRF) model. ASEFS also requires aerosol data fusion for improving accurate representation of spatio-temporally variable atmospheric aerosols to reduce DNI bias error in clear sky conditions over southern Queensland & New South Wales where solar power is vulnerable to uncertainities from frequent aerosol radiative events such as bush fires and desert dust. Initial results from thirteen years of Bureau of Meteorology’s (BOM) deseasonalised DNI and MODIS NASA-Terra aerosol optical depth (AOD) anomalies demonstrated strong negative correlations in north and southeast Australia along with strong variability in AOD (~0.03-0.05). Radiative transfer schemes, DNI and AOD anomaly correlations will be discussed for the population and transmission grid centric regions where current and planned CSP plants dispatch electricity to capture peak prices in the market. Aerosol and solar irradiance datasets include satellite and ground based assimilations from the national BOM, regional aerosol researchers and agencies. The presentation will provide an overview of this ASEFS project task on WRF and results to date. The overall goal of this ASEFS subtask is to develop a hybrid numerical weather prediction (NWP) and statistical/machine learning multi-model ensemble strategy that meets future operational requirements of CSP plant operators.",

            "abstract": "Studies of permeability changes of rocks during weathering are important to understand the processes of geomorphological development and how they are influenced by cyclic climatic conditions. Especially volcanic tuffs and pyroclastic flow deposits are easily affected by water absorption and freezing-thawing cycle (Erguler. 2009, Çelik and Ergül 2014). Peculiar erosional landscapes of Cappadocia, central Turkey, with numerous underground cities and carved churches, that made this area a world heritage site, are consists of volcanic tuffs and pyroclastic flow deposits. Understanding permeability changes of such rocks under different conditions are thus important not only to understand fundamental processes of weathering, but also to protect the landscapes of the world heritage sites and archaeological remains. In this study, we aim to evaluate internal void structures and bulk permeability of intact and weathered pyroclastic rocks from Cappadocia using X-ray CT, mercury intrusion porosimetry data and permeability measurement method of flow pump test. Samples of pyroclastic deposits that comprise the landscapes of Rose Valley and Ihlara Valley, were collected from the corresponding strata outside of the preservation areas. Porosity and pore-size distribution for the same samples measured by mercury intrusion porosimetry, indicate that the intact samples have lower porosity than weathered samples and pore sizes were dominantly 1-10µm in calculated radii, whereas weathered samples have more micropores (smaller than 1 µm). X-ray CT images were acquired to observe internal structure of samples. Micro-fractures, probably caused by repeated expansion and contraction due to temperature changes, were observed around clast grains. The higher micropore ratio in weathered samples could be attributed to the development of the micro-farctures. We will discuss fundamental processes of weathering and geomorphological development models using these data.",

            "abstract": "Recent geophysical surveys in subduction zones suggest that subduction earthquakes could occur along the uppermost part of oceanic crust composed of basaltic rocks. In fact, the fluidization of comminuted material and mineralogical signatures of frictional heating were reported from a few-centimeters-thick ultracataclasite in the underplated basalt that were formed in association with the downward step of the subduction thrust. Thus, high-velocity frictional properties of basaltic rocks are keys for understanding rupture propagation during subduction earthquakes. We conducted high-velocity (1.3 m/s) friction experiments on the disaggregated basaltic rocks under wet (water-saturated) conditions and at normal stresses of ~2.0 MPa. The samples were taken from pillow basalt, foliated cataclasite, and ultracataclasite developed in the underplated basalt in the Shimanto accretionary complex of eastern Shikoku, southwest Japan. All samples show slip weakening behavior and lower steady-state friction of <0.14. The samples from pillow basalt and foliated cataclasite show higher peak friction of 0.49–0.61 and 0.59–0.75, respectively, whereas those from the ultracataclasite exhibit lower peak friction of 0.26–0.29. Compared to the samples from pillow basalt and ultracataclasite, that from foliated cataclasite has longer slip weakening distance. The calculated fracture energy in the sample from ultracataclasite is considerably small owing to smaller stress drop and slip weakening distance, which could be due to the higher clay content of 50 wt.% relative to the samples from others (21–29 wt.%). Our results imply that the propagation of earthquake rupture through the ultracataclasite is energetically favorable. This is consistent with the fact that the geological evidence of earthquake faulting was found from the ultracataclasite.",

            "abstract": "Ab initio modulation models require a number of turbulence quantities as input for any reasonable diffusion tensor. While turbulence transport models describe the radial evolution of such quantities, they in turn require observations in the inner heliosphere as input values. So far we have concentrated on solar minimum conditions (e.g. Engelbrecht and Burger 2013, ApJ), but are now looking at long-term modulation which requires turbulence data over at a least a solar magnetic cycle. As a start we analyzed 1-minute resolution data for the N-component of the magnetic field, from 1974 to 2012, covering about two solar magnetic cycles (initially using IMP and then ACE data). We assume a very simple three-stage power-law frequency spectrum, calculate the integral from the highest to the lowest frequency, and fit it to variances calculated with lags from 5 minutes to 80 hours. From the fit we then obtain not only the asymptotic variance at large lags, but also the spectral index of the inertial and the energy, as well as the breakpoint between the inertial and energy range (bendover scale) and between the energy and cutoff range (cutoff scale). All values given here are preliminary. The cutoff range is a constraint imposed in order to ensure a finite energy density; the spectrum is forced to be either flat or to decrease with decreasing frequency in this range. Given that cosmic rays sample magnetic fluctuations over long periods in their transport through the heliosphere, we average the spectra over at least 27 days. We find that the variance of the N-component has a clear solar cycle dependence, with smaller values (~6 nT2) during solar minimum and larger during solar maximum periods (~17 nT2), well correlated with the magnetic field magnitude (e.g. Smith et al. 2006, ApJ). Whereas the inertial range spectral index (-1.65 ± 0.06) does not show a significant solar cycle variation, the energy range index (-1.1 ± 0.3) seems to be anti-correlated with the variance (Bieber et al. 1993, JGR); both indices show close to normal distributions. In contrast, the variance (e.g. Burlaga and Ness, 1998, JGR), and both the bendover scale (see Ruiz et al. 2014, Solar Physics) and cutoff scale appear to be log-normal distributed.",

            "abstract": "Large earthquakes such as the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku-Oki earthquake and the 2014 Mw 8.1 Iquique earthquake are often preceded by foreshock sequences migrating toward the hypocenters of mainshocks. Understanding the underlying physical processes is crucial for imminent seismic hazard assessment. Some of these foreshock sequences are accompanied by repeating earthquakes, which are thought to be a manifestation of a large-scale background slow slip transient. The alternative interpretation is that the migrating seismicity is simply produced by the cascade triggering of mainshock-aftershock sequences following Omori’s Law. In this case the repeating earthquakes are driven by the afterslip of the moderate to large foreshocks instead of an independent slow slip event. As an initial effort to discriminate these two hypotheses, we made a detailed analysis of the repeating earthquakes among the foreshock sequences of the 2014 Mw 8.1 Iquique earthquake. We observed that some significant foreshocks (M >= 5.5) are followed by the rapid occurrences of local repeaters, suggesting the contribution of afterslip. However the repeaters are distributed in a wide area (~40*80 km), which are difficult to be driven by only a few moderate to large foreshocks. Furthermore, the estimated repeater-inferred aseismic moment during the foreshock period is at least 3.041e19 Nm (5*5 km grid), which is of the same order with the total amount of seismic moment of all foreshocks (2.251e19 Nm). This comparison again supports the slow-slip model since the ratio of post-seismic to coseismic moment is small in most earthquakes. To estimate the contributions of the transient slow slip and cascade triggering in the initiation of large earthquakes, we propose to systematically search and analyze repeating earthquakes in all foreshock sequences preceding large earthquakes. The next effort will be made to the long precursory phase of large interplate earthquakes such as the 1999 Mw 7.6 Izimit earthquake and the 2003 Mw 8.3 Tokachi-Oki earthquake.",

            "abstract": "The Western Australian craton is composed of two Archean blocks, the early-to-mid Archean Pilbara craton and the late Archean Yilgarn craton, and surrounding Proterozoic orogens. Early seismic studies found that these Archean blocks are characterized as a signature type of simple crust and sharp crust-mantle transition, while the orogenic terranes have rather complex crustal structure and much diffused Moho, posing a question whether a possible change in the crustal forming processes occurred between Archean and Proterozoic. Applying receiver functions to available seismic stations, we estimate the bulk crustal thickness and Vp/Vs ratio across the Western Australian craton. The use of the 3D AuSREM velocity models greatly improves the robustness in the bulk crustal property estimates, especially the Vp/Vs ratio that is essential in deriving the crustal composition as well as inferring the tectonic history of individual tectonic units.\nOur crustal thickness estimates agree well with early studies. The Pilbara crust is uniformly thin (30 km) with a sharp Moho (20% receiver function relative amplitude), and is inferred as extremely felsic in crustal composition (Vp/Vs ratio 1.70, among the lowest in the craton crust globally). The Yilgarn crust is relatively thick (>35km), and is more toward intermediate (Vp/Vs ratio > 1.73). Lateral variations of the Vp/Vs ratios in Yilgarn correlate well with the sub-terranes, reinforcing the early proposal that individual sub-units had gained their unique seismic originality BEFORE the craton amalgamation. Differences between the Pilbara and Yilgarn crust suggest that the vertical and accretional tectonics may have played different roles in forming the cratons.\nAlong the Proterozoic orogens, thicker crust and weaker and possibly dipping Moho interfaces are observed, agreeing with that the regions have been repeatedly reworked. A 20-km thick lower crustal layer with >1.86 Vp/Vs ratio is observed in the Musgrave orogen, reflecting a more mafic composition of the layer which is likely the high velocity residue from early magmatic events. As part of the SIEF program, “Distal Footprints of Giant Ore systems”, a 2D seismic array is currently in place in the Capricorn orogen which joined Pilbara and Yilgarn around ~1.8Ga. Results will be presented and discussed at the meeting.",

            "abstract": "Unconventional energy and mineral resources are typically trapped in a low porosity/permeability environment and are difficult to produce. An extreme end-member is the shale gas reservoir in the Cooper Basin (Australia) that is located at 3500-4000 m depth and ambient temperature conditions around 200oC. Shales of lacustrine origin (with high clay content) are diagenetically altered. Diagenesis involves fluid release mineral reactions of the general type Asolid ↔ Bsolid +Cfluid and switches on suddenly in the diagenetic window between 100-200oC. Diagenetic reactions can involve concentrations of smectite, aqueous silica compound, illite, potassium ions, aqueous silica, quartz, feldspar, kerogen, water and gas . In classical petroleum engineering such interlayer water/gas release reactions are considered to cause cementation and significantly reduce porosity and permeability. Yet in contradiction to the expected permeability reduction gas is successfully being produced.\nWe propose that the success is based on the ductile equivalent of classical compaction bands in solid mechanics. The difference being that that the rate of the volumetric compaction is controlled by the diagenetic reactions. Ductile compaction bands are forming high porosity fluid channels rather than low porosity crushed grains in the solid mechanical equivalent. We show that this new type of volumetric instability appears in rate-dependent heterogenous materials as Cnoidal waves. These are nonlinear and exact periodic stationary waves, well known in the shallow water theory of fluid mechanics. Their distance is a direct function of the hydromechanical diffusivities. These instabilities only emerge in low permeability environment where the fluid diffusivity is about an order of magnitude lower than the mechanical loading. The instabilities are expected to be of the type as shown in the image below. The image shows a CT-scan of a laboratory experiment kindly provided by Papamichos (pers.comm.). Periodic compaction bands are clearly detected by the CT analysis of a shale sample compressed under high confining pressure.",

            "abstract": "A better understanding of decadal to centennial climate variability is vital to improve the accuracy of near future climate prediction. Hokkaido represents a region which has limited paleo-climate data and is sensitive to climate change. Instrumental data shows a good correlation between the temporal variability of temperature and rainfall with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) however instrumental data is limited to the past ~150 years. Therefore down-core reconstructions of temperature and precipitation prior to instrumental records are required to provide a better understanding of the long-term behaviour of the PDO and EASM systems in this region.\nLake Toyoni (Hokkaido, Japan) was investigated to provide high resolution lake temperature and hydrological reconstructions over the past 1000 years (1cm represents 3-8 years of sedimentation) using alkenones and the hydrogen isotopic composition of higher plant waxes (δD(HPW)), respectively.\nLake Toyoni is the first lake from which alkenones are reported in Japan. C37 alkenone concentrations in surface sediments are 18μg C37 g−1 of dry sediment and the dominant alkenone is C37:4 . 18S DNA analysis revealed the presence of a single alkenone producer in Lake Toyoni and thus a single calibration for reconstructing lake temperature based on alkenone unsaturation patterns. Temperature reconstructions over the past 1000 years suggest lake water changes of 8-23°C which is in line with water temperature changes observed in Lake Toyoni. \nThe molecular distributions and isotopic compositions of n-alkanes provide valuable paleo-environmental information. The dominant n-alkanes in Lake Toyoni are long chained (C25-C33) and are characterised by odd over even distribution. The source of long chained n-alkanes are from the surrounding terrestrial higher plants. Large fluctuations (~40‰) are documented in downcore δD(HPW) representing hydrological changes in this region over the past 1000 years.\nThese results suggest that alkenones and the δD(HPW)  preserved in Lake Toyoni record regional climate changes over decadal timescales. These fluctuations will be discussed in relation to globally recognised climate events, specifically the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age.",

            "abstract": "To increase the amount of oil and gas extracted during production, some techniques like EOR (Enhanced Oil Recovery) are applied by injecting some materials such as water and CO2. Recently, there are some researches for injecting magnetic nanoparticles with fluids during EOR. The size of particle is nano-scale, which can prevent particles from adhering to the pores of reservoir. The main purpose of injecting magnetic nanoparticles is to monitor movement or distribution of EOR fluids.\nTo monitor the injected magnetic EOR fluids in the reservoir, CSEM (controlled source electromagnetic method) can be the most optimized geophysical method among various geophysical monitoring methods. Depending on the reservoir circumstances, we can control the electric or magnetic sources to monitor reservoir during oil or gas production.\nIn this study, we perform numerical simulation of CSEM for 3D horizontal-layered models assuming a reservoir under production. We suppose that there are two wells: one is for the controlled source; the other is for the receiver. By changing the distribution, movement and magnetization of EOR fluids, we compare the electric or magnetic fields recorded at the receiver. Maxwell’s equations are the governing equation of CSEM and are approximated by using the edge-based finite-element method. Direct solver is applied to solve the linear equations. Because injected magnetic nanoparticle changes the conductivity of EOR fluid, there is high contrast of conductivity of reservoir. This high contrast of conductivity induces secondary electric or magnetic fields that are recorded at the receiver well. We compare these recorded secondary fields generated by various movement or distribution of magnetic EOR fluid.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the “Development of Technology for CO2 Marine Geological Storage” grant funded by the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries of Korea, by the “Civil Military Technology Cooperation Center”, and by the International Cooperation (No. 2012-8510030010) of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP).

            "abstract": "Giving proper care to selecting microseisms from well isolated cyclones, these great oceanic storms can be monitored in real time by seismic recordings at stations 1200-4100 km distant from the cyclone's center. We treat ocean depths of 3.4-5.5 km. For the theoretically-computed microseism, which our procedure compares with the experimental data, we use a Green's-function approach in the frequency domain. Relating recorded displacement F and theoretical Green's function G, We have F(ω,r)=S(ω)G(ω,r) in which our only unknown is the generalized source function S(ω) and r is the distance to the center at any specific time. The basic result of this report is that the form of this function is A SN(ω), where A is a real constant increasing with the strength of the cyclone and SN(ω), is a positive real function of frequency, independent of cyclone-receiver separation and of cyclone strength. That is, for a given ocean basin, and a given receiver-region geology, at our current level of accuracy SN(ω) is the same for all cyclone strengths and cyclone-receiver separations. Using the multimode approach, we've developed the numerical method for computing the Green's function for multilayered oceanic structures. For each of the 4 selected cyclones, the source functions for all locations along the path show a consistency which demonstrates that the recorded microseisms are radiated from the cyclone. The extracted source function exhibits spectra that are characteristic of ocean waves generated by cyclonic winds. With knowledge of distance between the source and receiver, cyclone A is therefore trivial to monitor in real time from remote recordings. At the current time, the cyclone's strength—generalized source function—must be related empirically to the cyclone's maximum wind speed, areal extent, and lateral velocity.",

            "abstract": "Twenty-first century coupled climate model simulations, observations from the recent past, and theoretical arguments suggest a consistent trend towards warmer ocean temperatures and fresher polar surface oceans in response to increased radiative forcing resulting in increased upper ocean stratification and reduced ventilation and oxygenation of the deep ocean. Paleo-proxy records of the warming at the end of the last ice age, however, suggests a different outcome, namely a better ventilated and oxygenated deep ocean with global warming.\nHere we use a four thousand year global warming simulation from a comprehensive Earth System Model (GFDL ESM2M) to show that this conundrum is a consequence of different rates of warming and that the deep ocean is actually better ventilated and oxygenated in a future warmer equilibrated climate consistent with paleo-proxy records. The enhanced deep ocean ventilation in the Southern Ocean occurs in spite of increased positive surface buoyancy fluxes and a constancy of the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds – circumstances that would otherwise be expected to lead to a reduction in deep ocean ventilation. This ventilation recovery occurs through a global scale interaction of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation undergoing a multi-centennial recovery after an initial century of transient decrease and transports salinity-rich waters inform the subtropical surface ocean to the Southern Ocean interior on multi-century timescales. The subsequent upwelling of salinity-rich waters in the Southern Ocean strips away the freshwater cap that maintains vertical stability and increases open ocean convection and the formation of Antarctic Bottom Waters. As a result, the global ocean oxygen content and the nutrient supply from the deep ocean to the surface are higher in a warmer ocean. The implications for past and future changes in ocean heat and carbon storage will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "IODP Expedition 343 (JFAST) drilled three holes through the plate boundary near the Japan Trench to investigate the cause of very large fault slip during the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake. Interstitial fluids and rocks within and around the plate-boundary fault were recovered from Hole C0019E. Chemical characteristics of these fluids and rocks provide useful information for understanding fluid-related processes that occurred in the shallow megathrust fault zone at the Japan Trench. In this paper, we report concentrations and isotope ratios of boron determined for JFAST fluids and rocks, as well as for sediments from DSDP site 436, which is a nearby input site.\nDepth profiles of B content and B isotope ratio (δ11B value) for the interstitial fluids show a clear minimum and a maximum, respectively, around the plate boundary fault. Fluids from the vicinity of the fault are characterized by lower B content and higher δ11B value compared with seawater. The B contents and δ11B values of the plate-boundary fault rocks are indistinguishable from those of smectite-rich sediments from DPDP site 436, which is consistent with observations for other trace element compositions.\nIn the systems composed of seawater-like fluid and sediment, both B concentrations and δ11B values in the fluid and solid phases are temperature-sensitive, and higher temperatures result in higher B and lower δ11B in the fluid phase and lower B and lower δ11B in the solid phase. Actually, interstitial fluids from ODP site 808 (Nankai Trough) showed a clear increase and a decrease of B and δ11B, respectively, with increasing depth at temperatures higher than 50 deg. C (You et al., 1995). The ODP site 808 rocks also showed distinct decreases of B and δ11B at the depths with temperatures higher than 100 deg. C (You et al., 1995). The observed B and δ11B characteristics of the JFAST fluids and rocks thus indicate that fluids and rocks within and around the plate-boundary fault have no clear record for fluid-rock interactions at high temperatures, at least for samples analyzed in this study. This provides constraints on the nature of fluid-rock interactions in the shallow megathrust fault zone during the Tohoku-Oki earthquake.\n",

Ltd.) has been operated to investigate aerosol properties at a SKYNET (SKYradiometer NETwork) site, YGN (Yongin) for six years starting from November 2008. The site is at the rooftop of a five-story building on the hill, about 35 km southeast of downtown Seoul (37.34 °N, 127.27 °E and 167 m above sea level). POM-02 measures the diffuse radiation at six minute intervals at 11 wavelengths. Using version 5 of the skyrad.pack, aerosol optical (aerosol optical depth and single scattering albedo) and microphysical (volume size distribution) properties were retrieved from the measurements at five wavelengths such as 400, 500, 675, 870 and 1020 nm. In comparison with CIMEL sun photometers used in AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork), another worldwide ground-based network, skyradiometers have an advantage that they can provide larger number of aerosol property data at shorter time intervals. However, standard procedures for instrument operation and data retrieval have not been established. In this study, we first showed how we calibrated the instrument and how we obtained cloud screened and quality assured data. Next, we presented variations in aerosol optical and microphysical properties, depending on air masses and/or meteorological conditions, and examined the characteristic of high aerosol loading episodes including Asian dust storm and smog.",

            "abstract": "The main merit of the Critical Zone (CZ) Science is to foster multidisciplinary approaches on one of the most important envelopes of our Planet, the zone on which humanity lives and on which humans develop their societies. Policy makers and stakeholders also require a more unified scientific vision on the behavior of the CZ.\nThe CZ science is not new and many communities have been doing CZ science for many decades. CZ-type observatories have been developed in most of the countries for different aims but generally lack of an integrated approach. When hydrologic measurements are made, they are generally not associated to geochemical measurements and the situation is worst for biological parameters. Instrumental geophysics of the CZ has done impressive progresses over the last decades but the misfit between the scientific questions and instrumental development is still a challenging issue.\nWe will take the example of the French initiatives to build up a wide community of CZ scientists (“critical zonists”) at the national scale taking into account decades of instrumentation and observation. More than creating new CZOs the French national research agencies helped foster collaboration between existing infrastructures by funding networking activities and developing significant investment programs for new equipment. We will review the main challenges of creating CZ networks based on existing funded research infrastructures and highlight the main instrumental challenges that need to be addressed to explore and understand the CZ in a modern way. The French initiatives mirror the European initiatives and the need for developing the links between the geo-centered initiative CZ concept and the ecology-centered concepts of LTER (and more recently LTSER) at the European scale. This willingness of linking historically separated communities is a stimulating opportunity for the advance of integrated Earth and Life sciences. As quoted by Bruno Latour (2014) the new environmental challenges that human beings are facing need a « compositionist » approach that the CZ concept is providing. This will benefit to science but also meet the new societal needs that the major environmental changes are creating.\nLatour B.

            "abstract": "Cosmogenic nuclides in detrital river sediments have been widely applied to derive denudation rates and sediment fluxes across entire catchments. Nuclides, such as 10Be, allow the derivation of denudation rates integrated over several hundreds to thousands of years, but single isotopic systems often provide little information on the intricate dynamics that control the export of sediments from catchments. The quantification of sediment storage and recycling within catchments is nevertheless crucial for a better understanding of the variability of sediments fluxes and their implication for landscape evolution. The paired measurement of 10Be along with cosmogenic, in-situ 14C in river sediments may provide new insides into sediment dynamics over kyr time scales for which other nuclides are not suitable [1,2].\nIn an effort to better understand the sediment dynamics in active orogens we combine in-situ 14C and 10Be measurements from the Kosi basin in eastern Nepal (~53 000 km2). Our preliminary 14C/10Be data shows apparent burial/storage ages of 14 to 21 kyr in the sediments currently exported by the river. These elevated burial ages suggest a larger storage component than previously thought in these catchments, even though possible biases associated to the use of 14C/10Be in sediments as burial chronometer have to be considered: First, the short half-life of 14C cannot be neglected and hence basin wide denudation cannot be considered as a simple mixing of sediments from individually eroding surfaces, introducing bias towards higher apparent burial ages in most settings. Second, in steep environments, sediments supplied by deep-seated landslides carry a buried signature that should not be confounded with sediment storage in the catchment. The importance of both biases needs to be quantified carefully, before basin-wide storage can be quantified.\n[1] Lauer & Willenbring, 2010 – JGR-Earth, vol. 115, F04018.\n[2] Hippe et al., 2012 – Geomorphology, vol. 179, pp. 58-70.",

In this study, utilizing outputs of ten Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models, we examine future changes of precipitation near Japan during June in relation to the subtropical jet, which has been pointed out as one of the environmental fields that are favorable for the Baiu front.\nMany models show there is more rainfall over the Pacific to the south of Japan islands in future climate (2080-2099) than in the current climate (1985-2004). However, relatively large variability among models is found over Japan islands and the Japan Sea: Six models (defined as group A) show decreases or small changes in rainfall over Japan islands and the Japan Sea and the peak of rainfall to the south of Japan, while four models (group B) show increases in rainfall over Japan islands and the adjacent regions. This tendency of each group is found both in current and future climates, which contributes to the differences in the pattern of future changes of rainfall between the two groups. In group A, the axis of the subtropical jet tends to be more tilted to the south toward the mid to lower troposphere from the upper troposphere than in group B. That means that the mid-tropospheric jet for group A is located to the south of that for group B. Areas of large moisture convergence in the mid-troposphere for group A are also found to the south of those for group B. It is suggested that the mid-tropospheric jet may affect distributions of precipitation through moisture supply. We will also examine changes in precipitation of the Baiu front in relation to other environments such as processes in the lower troposphere.\n[Acknowledgment]: This work is supported by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (2A-1201) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan.",

            "abstract": "We applied a novel mesh-free method to solve wave equations. Although the conventional finite difference methods determine the coefficients of its operator based on the regular grid alignment, the mesh-free method is not restricted to regular arrangements of nodes. We derive the mesh-free approach using the multi-variable Taylor expansion. The methodology can provide arbitrary-order accuracy in space by expanding the influence domain which controls the number of neighboring nodes. First, the dispersion property of the method is investigated using a plane wave analysis. Although the scheme for the irregular distribution of the calculation points is more dispersive than that of the regular alignment, the choice of the higher-order scheme can improve the dispersion property of the method. Next, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method using homogeneous and heterogeneous media. In the homogeneous medium case, we calculate acoustic wave propagation with regular and irregular distributions of the calculation points. The result from the irregular arrangement has good agreement with that of the regular one. In the heterogeneous medium case, we set a low velocity anomaly in the model, and calculate acoustic wave propagation with fine, coarse and partially fine arrangements of the calculation points. The coarse arrangement induces severe numerical dispersion inside the low velocity anomaly. On the other hand, partially fine arrangement can suppress the numerical dispersion, and can reproduce accurate wave field as well as the fine arrangement. Since the partially fine arrangement use fine alignment only around the anomaly, the computational cost can be kept low. Our result indicates that the method can provide accurate and efficient solutions for acoustic wave propagation using adaptive distribution of the calculation points.",

            "abstract": "The exploitation of the extended polymetallic deposits of the Altiplano in South America led to significant emissions of the neurotoxic Pb into the atmosphere already since pre-Colonial times. Long-term histories of Pb pollution in Eastern and Western Europe, Asia, and North America suggest that within the Northern Hemisphere emissions from metallurgy and coal combustion are minor compared to that from leaded gasoline during the second half of the 20th century. However, there is no equivalent data for Southern America.\nHere we present the first comprehensive, high-resolution two millennia Pb emission history for South America, based on an ice core record from Illimani glacier in Bolivia. Illimani is the highest mountain of the eastern Bolivian Andes and is located at the northeastern margin of the Bolivian Altiplano. The 2000 year ice-core based decadal Pb deposition history revealed highest Pb Enrichment Factors (EFs) during the period 1965-85. Metallurgical processing for silver production during periods of the Tiwanaku culture (400-900 AD), the Inca empire (1450-1532 AD), colonial times (1532-1900 AD), and the tin production at the beginning of the 20th century were identified as major sources for enhanced Pb EFs before the 1960s. Gasoline related Pb emissions in 1965-85, however, led to a threefold increase of the Pb EFs compared to the emission level from metal production, considerably preceding those of the past 2000 years.  This finding is complementary to the local air pollution signal preserved in lake sediments and in good agreement with various studies from the Northern Hemisphere.",

            "abstract": "Rockmagnetic results and electron microscopic observations on a sediment core retrieved from a proven cold seep environment of Krishna-Godavari (KG) Basin revealed an anomalously magnetically enhanced zone (17 - 23 mbsf) below the present-day SMTZ in the KG offshore basin. This zone is characterized by higher SIRM / k, kARM / SIRM and kfd % values indicating the presence of fine grained superparamagnetic (SP) sized ferrimagnetic iron sulphides minerals such as greigite formed due to anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). Identification of such mineral phases and understanding the mechanism of their formation and preservation is of vital importance which could provide better understanding of the geochemical processes on the paleo – SMTZ. Magnetic concentrates extracted from this zone were characterised by transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X- ray spectrometry. We observed two possible occurrences of magnetic phases within this sediment depths 17 - 23 mbsf. (a) authigenically formed SP sized ferrimagnetic inclusions of magnetite, pyrite and greigite within matrix of host siliceous grain, (b) poorly crystallized fine-grained magnetite with ill defined grain boundary possibily formed extracellulary by magnetotactic bacterias through biologically-induced mineralization. High methane fluxes as observed in this basin provides suitable environment for the formation of greigite in the vicinity of SMTZ. We hypothesize that due to availability of residual iron and low supply of hydrogen sulphide caused by downwards diffusion lead to preservation of greigite. The occurence of greigite as inclusion within the host silicate matrix might explain its preservation in this zone in spite of intense pyritization. The greigite would otherwise be converted to stable-form pyrite. It is challenging to explain the origin of biologically produced magnetite within 17 - 23 mbsf as it is expected to dissolve in this zone due to intense pyritization.",

Internal Lockett Conglomerate architecture indicates at least three phases of progradation are recorded by Gilbert-type, delta-front deposits that are separated by delta-top distributaries and/or braidplain deposits, all of which form discontinuous sheets and lenses, and record aggradation. Evaluation of sedimentary features (particle size and organization, bedding features) allows identification of eight facies within the Lockett Conglomerate; sedimentary features were used to infer transportational and depositional mechanisms. Conglomerate facies HL-1 – HL-8 were assigned to one or more of the following depositional associations: Beachface/shoreface, Deltafront, Alluvial fan, Braidplain (fluvial, unchannelized), Delta-top distributaries, and Mouth-bars. A series of Depositional Packages was identified, and mapped; integration with measured sections allowed development of a facies model for an alluvial delta in which the subaerial component is dominated by the braidplain association, and the subaqueous component by the (Gilbert-type) deltafront association as well as the delta-top distributary and mouthbar associations. Locally, the beachface association marks the transition between the subaqueous and subaerial components of the alluvial delta. Alluvial fan deposits are absent, but the rounded pebbles, cobbles and boulders with a new and distinctive provenance signature indicate derivation from a newly exposed igneous and metamorphic basement, and abrasion during transport through the fluvial (braidplain) system prior to deposition as part of the alluvial delta.",

            "abstract": "In this work we develop a general methodology to obtain high-resolution spatial-temporal forecasts of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) using ensembles of general circulation model (GCM) output and historical records as the major driving force. As a case study, we consider SST in the North Pacific Ocean. We use two ensembles of different GCM simulation output, made available in the 4th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. One corresponds to 20th century forcing conditions and the other corresponds to the emissions scenario A1B for the 21st century. Given a representation of the SST spatio-temporal fields based on a common set of empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs), we use a hierarchical Bayesian model for the EOF coefficients to estimate a baseline and a set of model discrepancies. These components are all time-varying. The model enables us to extract relevant temporal patterns of variability from both the observations and simulations as well as obtain common patterns from all GCM simulations. This is used to obtain unified 21st century forecasts of relevant oceanic indexes as well as whole fields of forecast North Pacific SST. The unified forecast captures large longterm oceanic behavior, however the coarse resolution prevents us from capturing coastal behaviors. We use the unified forecast to model high resolution SST by establishing a link between large and small scale variability using statistical downscaling techniques. Using a combination of a discrete process convolution and a dynamic linear model, we obtain a smooth high-resolution forecast of SST fields off the coast of California.

            "abstract": "Climate change is estimated to have already affected crop production adversely. The major way in which climate influences crop production is through extreme weather events such as droughts and frosts. Numerous studies have examined the influence of historical and potential future climate means on crop production. However few have quantified the influence of extreme weather events. We used a statistical approach, “superposed epoch analysis” or compositing, to estimate the relationship between historical weather-related disasters to crop production from 1961-2007. We obtained historical data on floods, droughts, extreme heat, and extreme cold events from the Emergency Events Database, EM-DAT. We related these to historical national-level harvested area, yield, and production statistics for cereal crops from the FAOSTAT database. We found that droughts and extreme heat events have had a substantial influence on cereal crops, on average reducing crop production by 8% and 5% respectively, while cold waves and extreme cold events exhibit no statistically discernible influence. We further find that the influence of droughts is through a combination of reduced harvested area and yields, while extreme heat seems to have mainly affected yields. The underlying reasons for these different crop responses are unknown, as the statistical approach only estimates the revealed relationships and does not explore causes. Nevertheless these findings raise new questions on why certain weather events seem to have had substantial production impacts while others have not. We suggest that greater attention should be paid to studying the influence of actual weather events on crops, rather than the influence of mean climate alone.",

From almost four-year observations, the F-region nighttime irregularities occurred most frequently during post-sunset period. These nighttime irregularities usually appeared with occupying different height levels according to local time. This height variation of F-region FAIs was correlated with hmf2 of ionosonde in Icheon, South Korea. The irregularities were least active near the winter solstice and most active near summer solstice.

            "abstract": "In many parts of the Arctic, permafrost thaw due to rising temperatures results in the conversion of dry tundra to wetland bog and fen ecosystems. Such increases in anaerobic environments may have substantial feedbacks to the rate of climate change through the increased production of CH4, a greenhouse gas an order of magnitude more potent than the CO2 respired from aerobic soils. However, the total emission rates of CH4 and CO2 alone cannot predict the magnitude of feedback to the climate system since this will also depend on the ecosystem’s overall carbon balance and the source of carbon (new vs old) producing the emissions. Thus, building detailed carbon budgets is essential to understanding the potential climate feedbacks of habitat changes due to permafrost thaw. We studied above-ground plant biomass and its carbon content in order to calculate the inputs of new carbon to the soil along a permafrost thaw gradient with previously well-quantified CO2 and CH4 fluxes in northern Sweden. In order to account for within-season plant community turnover, we monitored plant percent cover over the course of a growing season in three communities: areas underlain by permafrost dominated by E. vaginatum, and E. nigrum, recently thawed sphagnum dominated areas, and more established E. angustifolium dominated fen communities. Additionally, we calculated end of season biomass and percent carbon for each species and compared our findings to previously published community composition assessments from 1972/1973 and 2000. We tied our ground-based measurements to aerial remote sensing images to extrapolate biomass and percent carbon across the mire based on community type. These results allow us to calculate total carbon inputs to the mire from new above-ground biomass. By coupling these measurements with flux rates from each habitat we will be able to assess the degree to which increased biomass production might offset the increase in CH4 released from soils as a result of plant community turnover after permafrost thaw.",

Although numerous records exist across the North Atlantic region, few Antarctic ice core records have been obtained from the south.\nHere we exploit the potential of upwelling ancient ice – so-called blue ice areas (BIAs) – from the Patriot Hills in the Ellsworth Mountains to derive the first deuterium isotope record (dD) from continental Antarctica south of the Weddell Sea. Gas analysis and glaciological considerations provide a first relative chronology and provide new constraints on ice sheet dynamics in the region. Inferred temperature trends from the Patriot Hills BIA and snow pit suggest changing climate influences during the transition between the last glacial period and Holocene.

            "abstract": "It is widely accepted that the Earth’s core is mainly composed of iron and contains light elements to account for its density deficit. Alloying with light elements significantly affects the physical properties of iron and depresses its melting temperature. Therefore, the melting relation of the Fe–light elements system is the key to clarify the thermal structure of the Earth’s core. Although there are many candidates for light elements in the core, sulfur and silicon are considered to be the major light elements. Some geochemical models predicted that sulfur and silicon could be present not only in the core of the Earth but also in the core of other terrestrial planets such as Mars and Mercury. To better understand the properties of the planetary cores, we investigated the melting relations of the Fe–S–Si system under high-pressure conditions.\nHere, we report the melting relations in the Fe–S–Si system up to 60 GPa. Melting experiments were performed in the pressure range of 20–60 GPa and the temperature range of 1300–2500 K using a double-sided laser-heated diamond anvil cell combined with X-ray diffraction technique. In situ X-ray diffraction experiments were conducted at the BL10XU beamline of the SPring-8 facility. The melting detection was based on disappearance of the X-ray diffraction peaks of the sample. On the basis of X-ray diffraction patterns, we confirmed that iron-silicon alloy which hcp and fcc structure and Fe3S are stable phases under subsolidus conditions. Both solidus and liquidus temperatures are significantly lower than the melting temperature of pure Fe and increases with pressure in this study. In order to draw the melting curve as a function of pressure, we fitted the present results using the Simon’s equation. Our results could provide important constraints on the thermal structure of the planetary cores.",

Additionally, for a fixed tidal distortion, a polar vortex first identified by Suess\n(1970) is re-examined that may drive an intense vortex at planetary settings.\n Second, we investigate the characteristics of turbulence in the bulk fluid layer generated via an elliptical\ninstability of librational and tidal forcing. An elliptic instability is the triadic resonance of two inertial modes\nwhose non-dimensional frequencies are between [-2-2] with the mechanically induced base flow.

            "abstract": "We have conducted air samplings at Nainital, India (29.36°N, 79.46°E, 1958 m a.s.l.) to analyze concentrations of greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O and SF6), CO, H2, and isotope ratios. The air samples were collected in 1.5 L Pyrex glass flasks at weekly time intervals. Here we discuss the methane flux in South Asia using Global Eulerian-Lagrangian Coupled Atmospheric (GELCA) model with the observational data of methane at Nainital.\nThe coupled model approach is suitable to represent observations at high spatial resolutions. The forward simulation represented a background feature of methane variations at Nainital, especially for low methane concentrations in winter. However, the simulation overestimated summer enhancement of methane concentrations. In summer, air parcels observed at Nainital were transported from Ganges basin thus the atmospheric observational data at Nainital might constrain the methane flux due to rice cultivations. The impact of Nainital data to the methane flux estimates is examined using an atmospheric inverse modeling system based on GELCA.",

            "abstract": "In order to better understand the kinematic history of the Tarim block after the breakup of the Rodinia supercontinent, paleomagnetic studies have been carried out on late paleozoic strata from the Yecheng areas in the southwestern Tarim block. Totally, 250 sedimentary samples were collected from 25 sites in the late Carboniferous limestones. The stepwise thermal demagnetizations successfully isolated high unblocking temperature characteristic directions (HTC). The tilt-corrected mean direction is D/I =219.0°/-49.0° with α95=5.5° and N=25 sites, corresponding to a paleopole at 57.2°N, 167.0°E with A95=6.1°. All late Carboniferous samples from the studied section yield stable and coherent magnetic directions with reverse magnetic polarity. The predominance (100%) of reversed directions favor the interpretation that the HTC represents a primary remanence acquired during the permo-Carboniferous reversed polarity superchron. Also, positive fold test indicate a primary origin for the characteristic remanence. Comparisons of the late Carboniferous paleomagnetic poles of the Tarim block with available coeval poles of Junggar and Siberia blocks indicate (1) no significant latitudinal relative motion (2.6° ± 10.3° and 3.1° ± 7.3°) occurred since the Late Carboniferous among these blocks, and they may have accreted together by the late Carboniferous, but (2) the 62.5° ± 11.7° and the 30.2°± 8.3° counterclockwise rotations of the Tarim block with respect to Junggar and Siberia block took place since late Carboniferous. These rotations may be accommodated by the post-late Carboniferou strike–slip faults along the northern and southern sides of Tianshan Belt and the Altay Belt.",

            "abstract": "The atmosphere becomes warmer and more humid under global warming, while changes in precipitation show a large discrepancy on a regional scale. Changes in regional precipitation are usually associated with changes in tropical circulation. Stronger (weaker) upward motion enhances (reduces) precipitation amount and intensity, in addition to the effect of enhanced water vapor. In a more detailed analysis, however, changes in atmospheric vertical motion can be either strengthened or weakened, even within convective areas with positive rainfall anomalies. To understand the diverse responses of changes in tropical circulation in a warmer climate as well as the associated mechanism, atmospheric stability and the impact of the vertical structure of convection on tropical circulation are investigated in 32 coupled global climate models from CMIP3 and CMIP5. The study regions are convective areas with positive precipitation anomalies. Under global warming, an upward shift structure of vertical velocity is observed in all model simulations, which implies a deepening of convection and a more stable atmosphere. Areas with enhanced (weakened) ascending motion, the climatological bottom-heavy (top-heavy) structure of vertical velocity tends to import more (less) moist static energy to counteract the stabilization due to the effect of deepened convection, and then the ascending motion is strengthened (weakened). The bottom-heavy-like structure is dominated by shallow convection, while the top-heavy-like structure is usually associated with deep convection. In other words, shallow convection tends to strengthen tropical circulation and enhance upward motion in future climate.",

One of the solutions comes from locating the causative lightning discharges and source region of low latitude whistlers. In the present study, ~ 2000 whistlers recorded during period of one year (Dec, 2010 to Jan, 2011) at Allahabad (Geomag. lat. 16.79o N; L=1.08), India are correlated with lightning activity detected by World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) at and around conjugate region. About 63% of whistlers are correlated with the lightning strikes around conjugate region. Further to confirm this correlation, arrival azimuths of causative sferics are determined and the obtained azimuths points towards conjugate region of Allahabad. The characteristics of thunder cloud generating these whistlers are examined and found that the clouds with South-East alignment are more prone to trigger whistler waves. The seasonal and diurnal variation of whistler parameters such as occurrence rate, power spectral density and dispersion are also studied and explained on the basis of ionospheric conditions in low latitudes. The results obtained open a new window to look for the propagation mechanism of low latitude whistlers.",

            "abstract": "We present a revised analysis of the plate tectonic framework of Taiwan since the Late Cretaceous, a time when subduction polarity was still opposite to what is observed at present (westward subduction of the Pacific Plate, as opposed to eastward subduction of Eurasia at present). We place our reconstructions within a global plate tectonic frame, and discuss the consequences of subduction zone reversal for the evolving passive margin. Based on existing models (Seton et al. 2012, Zahirovic et al. 2014), we show that clockwise rotation of the Philippine Sea Plate results in complete subduction of the Proto South China Sea. This eastward-directed subduction results in a propagating subduction polarity flip along the Chinese passive margin, changing from westward-directed Pacific subduction, to present day eastward Eurasian subduction. This is independent of northward subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate underneath Eurasia in the Taiwan area. Our reconstructions yield a new model for the collisional history of Taiwan, which reconciles the pre-collisional architecture with the metamorphic conditions of the Cenozoic orogeny, and makes predictions about timing of peak-pressures, as well as the timing of collision and present subduction zone reversal. We argue that Taiwan is the result of a first collision between the Luzon Arc and a continental fragment, which rifted off the passive margin either during opening of the Proto South China Sea, or later, during opening of the South China Sea, and a second collision with the Chinese Passive margin proper. We constrain timing of collision to 6.5 and 3.5 Ma, respectively. An interesting implication of our model is that the first collision does not necessarily propagate along strike, which may explain facies distributions in the foreland, as well as uniform metamorphic conditions in the Tananao Complex. The orogeny potentially propagates from north to south only since its recent collision at 3.5 Ma.",

In this paper, these superposition effects are explored using diagnosed fields from the extended Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model and CMAM30. The nature and distribution of wind and temperature variability, the associated instabilities and chemical heating are discussed.

            "abstract": "An experimental study of physical weathering was performed on fresh and slightly weathered gneiss samples from the Wonju area of South Korea. The study investigated changes in the physico-mechanical properties of these samples during accelerated laboratory-based weathering, including analyses of microfracture formation. The deteriorated samples used in the study were subjected to 100–150 freeze–thaw cycles, with index properties and microfracture geometries measured between each cycle. Each complete freeze–thaw cycle lasted 24 hours, and consisted of 2 hours of saturation in a vacuum chamber, 8 hours of freezing at –21°C ±1°C, and 14 hours of thawing at room temperature. Specific gravity and seismic velocity values were negatively correlated with the number of freeze–thaw cycles, whereas absorption values tended to increase. The amount of deterioration of the rock samples was dependent on the degree of weathering of the rock prior to the start of the analysis. Absorption, specific gravity, and seismic velocity values can be used to infer the amount of physical weathering experienced by a gneiss in the study area. The sizes and density of microfracture in the rock specimens varied with the number of freeze–thaw cycles. It was found that box fractal dimensions can be used to quantify the formation and propagation of microfracture in the samples. In addition, these box fractal dimensions can be used as a weathering index for the mid- and long-term prediction of rock weathering. The present results indicate that accelerated-weathering analysis can provide a detailed overview of the weathering characteristics of deteriorated rocks.",

            "abstract": "Overshooting convection penetrating the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) and the lower stratosphere has a significant impact on the redistribution of water vapour and further trace gases. This is of importance for the stratospheric water vapour budget, which plays a central role in radiative and chemical processes. Modelling studies and in situ measurements show the hydration potential of convective overshooting partly by direct injection of ice particles into the stratosphere and subsequent sublimation. However, processes leading to dehydration of the TTL may also impact the stratospheric humidity by limiting the amount of water vapour carried aloft. While the large scale drives some of the dehydrating processes, others are of convective origin, for example gravity waves and cooling associated with overshooting turrets. Furthermore, downdrafts may transport dry and ozone rich air masses from the stratosphere into the TTL. Improving our understanding of overshooting convection and its influence on TTL water vapour will ultimately place better constraints on the budget of water vapour in the stratosphere.\nIn this study we use three-dimensional cloud resolving (WRF-ARW) simulations of a deep convective thunderstorm (Hector) to study the redistribution of water vapour and trace gases in the upper TTL/lower stratosphere. Passive tracers are initialised to investigate the transport of air masses. The simulations focus on an Hector event that has been probed by aircraft during the SCOUT-O3 field campaign. Observations were performed in and around overshoots that even penetrated the stratosphere. These observations as well as the model simulations show downward transport and mixing of air masses from the stratosphere, though less strong and more localised in the simulation. Furthermore, the simulations shows a layering of hydrated and dehydrated air masses post-convection in the upper TTL and lower stratosphere. Here we use the model to explain the processes causing the transport and also expose areas of inconsistencies between the model and observations.",

The forward-stepwise regression method selects the potential predictors that satisfy a few criteria. The potential predictors selected are springtime sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the North Atlantic (NA1), the North Pacific (NPC) and the tropical Pacific Ocean (CNINO), the Northern Indian Ocean (NIO), the Bering Sea (BS), the Western North Pacific (WNP), and the spring Eurasian snow cover anomalies (EUSC). Using these predictors, four regression models are developed and compared with observations. The correlation skill score for the weighted ensemble mean forecast amounts to as high as ~0.89 for last 20 years. The Gerrity skill score calculated from a 3 by 3 contingency table is also as high as ~0.86. The physical process associated with each predictor has been discussed. The five predictors (NA1, NPC, CNINO, WNP and NIO) affect Changma precipitation by tropical and extra-tropical forcing. These factors tend to develop or strengthen the anticyclonic anomalies to the south or southeast of the Korean peninsula. In contrast, the two predictors (EUSC and BS) tend to strengthen the Okhotsk high. Both anticyclonic circulation anomalies act to strengthen the Changma front.",

            "abstract": "As part of the ICDP-GONAF project (Geophysical Observatory at the North Anatolian Fault) geophone arrays have been installed in 300 m deep boreholes around the eastern Sea of Marmara. The objectives of GONAF are to (1) monitor the North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ) at the transition from the 1999 Izmit rupture to the Princes Islands segment offshore Istanbul, where a M ~ 7 earthquake can reasonably be expected to occur and (2) to determine ground-motion amplification and near-surface properties at the GONAF sites. Here we use recordings from the first GONAF borehole on the Tuzla peninsula in eastern Istanbul. The array consists of one 1 Hz 3C Mark Products L4 seismometer at the surface, three 1 Hz vertical Mark Products L4 seismometers at 75 m depth-spacing, and 2 Hz and 15 Hz 3C Geospace HS-1 and DM2400 seismometers at 288 m depth. During April - May 2013 this array recorded a microearthquake swarm located ~ 3.5 km epicentral distance south of the Tuzla site. By cross-correlating the continuous Tuzla data with the only swarm event detected by the regional network (20th of April 2013, Md 1.6) we retrieved an additional of 113 events. The swarm and an additional 15 events located throughout the eastern Marmara region were used to analyze the near-surface properties of the Tuzla site. We derive a velocity model from sonic-log measurements which were conducted upon completion of the Tuzla well. This model is confirmed by modeling travel-time curves with forward ray-tracing and by an analysis of spectral interference effects. In the uppermost ~80 m at this site we observe an unexpectedly high velocity lid (VP ~ 4000 m/s) over a much slower (VP ~ 3000 m/s) ~50 m thick zone. These velocity structure leads to interference effects between up and downgoing waves even at the deepest stations. As a result of this the standard spectral ratio technique for deriving the site response becomes poor approximation. However, waveform deconvolution techniques allow determination of the seismic propagator matrix, by which the downhole signals can be deconvolved using the surface signal, making it possible to derive the near surface properties by an inversion method. The results show that while signal amplitudes of the upcoming body waves are noticeably reduced, the unusual velocity structure results in unexpectedly large surface displacements.",

            "abstract": "In reverse fault-bounded high relief mountain ranges, large-magnitude earthquakes contribute to the topographic growth by co- and inter-seismic surface uplift on the hanging wall. Meanwhile, they also trigger widespread landslides along ridge lines or hillslopes. Coseismic landsliding lowers relief and causes a phase of high erosion in the period following the quake. The net effect of large-magnitude earthquakes in topographic evolution of active orogens partially depends on how fast the landslide debris are being evacuated out of the mountain range. The 2008 Mw7.9 Wenchuan earthquake, China activated the Longmen Shan reverse fault system in eastern Tibetan plateau, also induced enormous amount of landslides, volume comparable to the coseismic uplift, providing an excellent opportunity to address the question. We use cosmogenic 10Be concentration in river sand as a tracer to study the sediment routing process of coseismic landslide debris, because landslide debris contains low 10Be concentration. We sampling annually during 2008-2013, at 19 locations along the rivers that traverse the fault ruptures, with upstream catchment area varying between 4.4 km2 and 21775 km2, including 10 catchments sampled before Wenchuan earthquake in 2004 and 2005. A comparison with pre-earthquake measurements show reduced 10Be concentration at all sites. This dilution is more significant for small catchments on short range-front rivers: mostly half to one-fourth, and down to one-fifth in some cases. Multi-year time series of 10Be concentration at single sites show roughly constant level of dilution six years after the quake, with moderate temporal fluctuations, which may be related to the variation in precipitation and storm intensity. Under the assumption of constant dilution rate and a depth-mixing of 10Be concentration for landslide input, a simple calculation indicates it would take ~ 200 to 3000 years to completely evacuate the landslides debris within range-front transverse rivers, due to the tremendous amount of material piled at the valley bottoms. This is a large fraction of or comparable to the 2000- to 3000-year return time of Wenchuan-type large-magnitude earthquakes, and orders of magnitude longer than the well-studied case of 1999 Mw7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake at the western foothill of the Central Range of Taiwan.",

            "abstract": "Geographical conditions make a specific local circulation for each condition. The circulation around urban area affects a diurnal change of urban atmosphere, and then urban warming intensifies or weakens depending on the geographical condition. Comparing the effects on the diurnal change, those on the climatological change as an urban climate are insufficiency investigated. Understanding the geographical effects can be considered as one of the necessary factors to generalize urban climate. Therefore, in this study, formations of urban climate were represented for an inland city, a coastal city and a basin city using ideal experiments and were compared among them to access the effects of geographical conditions on urban climate.\nFor the formation of urban climate in an inland city, the mixing layer grows up as the urbanization makes progress in the night, and thus, the temperature change seems to be become small. The tendency of temperature rises during the nighttime decelerates with developing of urbanization. By contrast, the tendency during the daytime accelerates because it takes time for a heat island circulation to reach inside of the urban area when the city expands. For the formation in a coastal city, the temperature rise amount is smaller than that of the inland city. Sea and land breeze play an important role in the trend of urban climate in the coastal city. Thickness of sea breeze decides the height of mixing layer over the city during the day, especially in summer. The rise of daily maximum temperature accelerates. For the formation in a basin city, strong stable layer exists over the urban area throughout a day and the development of mixing layer by heat from the urban constricts in the layer. The tendency of temperature rise accelerates. The geographical effects appear most significantly on the daily minimum temperature. The temperature difference between the coastal city and the inland city is larger than that between the basin city and the inland city for all stage of urban development. The trends of daily mean temperature rise show a deceleration for the inland city and the coastal city and acceleration for the basin city.",

However, since major aerosol types such as mineral dust, secondary inorganic ions, and carbonaceous aerosols are typically in specific size ranges, we can estimate the chemical composition of aerosols from the size distribution. We measured the mass size distribution of aerosols using an optical particle counter (Grimm Model 1.109) for a year from February 2013 to February 2014 at intervals of 10 minutes. The optical particle counter measures number concentrations between 0.25 and 32 μm in 31 bins and converts them into mass concentrations assuming a sphere and densities of aerosols in urban environment which originate from traffic and other combustion sources and are secondarily formed from photochemical reactions. The measurement site is at the rooftop of the five-story building on the hill (37.34 °N, 127.27 °E, 167 m above sea level), about 35 km southeast of downtown Seoul, the downwind area of which is affected by prevailing northwesterlies. There are no major emission sources nearby except a 4-lane road running about 1.4 km to the west. We tried to characterize the bimodal property of the mass size distribution, consisting of fine and coarse modes, in terms of mass concentration and mean diameter. Monthly and diurnal variations in mass concentration and mean diameter of each mode were investigated to estimate major aerosol types as well as major factors causing those variations.",

            "abstract": "Aeolian sediments commonly are well sorted. However, aeolian megaripples (aka coarse-grained ripples or granule ripples) have bimodal grain size-frequencies. Distinguishing aeolian megaripple deposits from mixed grain size fluvial deposits is important, particularly for martian sedimentary rocks where implications for flowing water in the martian past (if revealed by legitimate fluvial deposits) are important mission drivers for rovers and landers. Aeolian megaripples are relatively minor components of terrestrial aeolian settings (e.g., as interdune features), but on Mars, megaripples have been encountered in many locations by landers and rovers, are durable due to indurated, armoring surface layers of very coarse sand, and therefore are likely candidates for preservation in the martian sedimentary rock record. Unfortunately, megaripple deposits preserved in martian sedimentary rocks must be recognized with much less data or context than obtained typically during terrestrial fieldwork.\nWe have undertaken wind tunnel experiments and fieldwork to assist interpretations distinguishing aeolian megaripple deposits from mixed grain fluvial materials. Lags of coarse or very coarse sand from ancient aeolian environments within the White Rim Sandstone, Canyonlands NP, UT, and at some localities along the J2 Unconformity at Buckhorn Wash, UT, are well sorted, with a sharply defined maximum grain size in each case. We conducted wind tunnel experiments to explore whether the well-sorted, sharp cutoff in maximum grain size of the coarse fraction in these deposits could be diagnostic of aeolian megaripple formation and migration. Wind tunnel experiments involved 250 μm sand saltating against 600-2800 μm grains. For a given wind tunnel speed, only a narrow grain size range appeared on megaripple surfaces as these bedforms developed spontaneously from the bed; somewhat finer grains migrated rapidly downwind, while slightly coarser grains remained immobile. The physics of saltation-driven creep seems to explain this effect. Saltation-driven creep rapidly segregates the grains downwind according to size, partly because the mass of the coarse target grain increases greatly with only minor increases in grain radius and this can be only partly compensated by increasing the saltating grain speed.",

In the retrieval algorithm, a correction of the path radiance effect of aerosol scattering/absorption is important to reduce the error in the gaseous absorption. For this purpose, the Cloud and Aerosol Imager (CAI) has been deployed to provide the aerosol information with its five bands including a unique 380nm band with 500m FOV. This band was also installed in the GLobal Imager (GLI) aboard the ADEOS-II satellite in 1990s. At this wavelength the surface reflectance is very small for improved aerosol remote sensing over arid land surfaces of high reflectance. We like to discuss new remote sensing algorithms with use of this NUV band and also a new formulation of multi-wavelength and multi-pixel remote sensing. We found that the new method significantly stabilize the inversion problem, even with only five wavelengths, to obtain both the aerosol optical thickness and single scattering albedo over land area through maximum use of the land surface heterogeneity of the moderate resolution imagers with FOV of 500m to 1km. We also like to discuss a new design of the 2nd CAI (CAI-2) aboard the GOSAT follow-on satellite (GOSAT-2) planned to be launched in 2017. This CAI-2 imager will carry 10 wavelengths including 340nm and 380nm and with two viewing geometries of tilt angles of -20 and +20 degrees along the track to avoid the sun-glitter in the ocean. We like to discuss how the capability of aerosol remote sensing is enhanced with this new design.",

Lake Abashiri has a distinct halocline around 5m depths, and is divided into oligohaline epilimnion and polyhaline hypolimnion by its pycnocline. In this study, paleoenvironmental and climatic changes of the Common Era in Abashiri region is discussed by sedimentologic and geochemical high-resolution analysis of the sediment cores collected from the Lake Abashiri. The 13AB-B1 core collected from Lake Abashiri shows the length of 27m. This core is composed of muddy sediment with a distinct lamination up to 19.31m below surface. The Ta-a tephra (AD 1739), Ko-c2 tephra (AD 1694) and Ma-b tephra (10th century) are found at the horizon of 2.65m, 2.91m, and 6.19m below surface, respectively. Sedimentation rate based on these ages was 5.7mm/yr between Ko-c2 tephra and Ta-a tephra, and was 4.7mm/yr between Ma-b tephra and Ko-c2 tephra. The environment of bottom water indicates the anoxic and/or euxinic conditions during the Common Era.\nThe result of observation used by Soft X-ray photograph, the lamina-set of high, low, intermediate density layers was observed. High-density layers have characteristics of low TOC, low SiO2, and high Al contents. This is suggested that high-density layer is formed by the supply of inorganic clastics. The lamina set of 44 was recognized between Ko-c2 tephra and Ta-a tephra in the 10AB-5C core. This is suggested that this set is annual lamina (varve). If its so, it is considered that high density layer indicate the high precipitation term of summer season judging from precipitation pattern in Abashiri Area during 100 years. Particularly, the year of flood events tend to show a thick and distinguished layer in lamina-set. The 13AB-B core is correlated with 10AB-5C core under the lamina level.\n The high-density lamina-set group is repeated with 20 to 30 year cycle. The horizon of high-density lamina-set group is correlated with the term showing several years continuously high precipitation. This lamina-set group is observed from 400 years ago, the climate system would have been continued. There seems to be high-low density cycle of some order before this time. It is consider that this cycle is related to the rainfall pattern over the medium to long term.",

            "abstract": "Ash-rich volcanic plumes are very often associated with electrical discharges producing majestic display of lightning. Observation and understanding of this phenomenon can shed light on crucial properties of the plume such as mass eruption rate and content of fine particles, as recently demonstrated by laboratory investigation of volcanic lightning (Cimarelli et al., 2014). Despite the recent advances in experimental investigations and the increasing detailed observation by lightning monitoring arrays, many fundamental questions are yet unsolved. In particular, to which extent electrical discharges in volcanic plumes are comparable to thundercloud lightning? Is the presence of hydrometeors in the plume a necessary condition for the generation of volcanic lightning? Multiparametric observation of electrical activity at erupting volcanoes is key to answering these questions. Here we present the results of a campaign of measurements conducted at Sakurajima volcano (southern Japan) where, for the first time, we combined synchronized high-speed imaging with magnetotelluric (MT) and acoustic measurements of ash-rich plumes generating electrical discharges and compare our observations with maximum plume height measurement and atmospheric soundings. Results show that flashes concentrate within the plume and closer to the crater. Good correlation if found between cloud-to-ground versus intra-cloud events and the frequency and duration of recorded MT-signals, while measured currents at Sakurajima are 10 to 100 times smaller than those produced by thundercloud discharges. Finally, atmospheric soundings show that plumes producing flashes didn’t cross isotherms relevant for ice formation thus discarding a relevant contribution of hydrometeors in the generation of the observed volcanic lightning.\nCimarelli et al. 2014.

            "abstract": "Fabric anisotropy is a key control of rock behavior in different geological settings and over different timescales. However, the effect of tectonically folded fabrics on the brittle strength and failure mode of metamorphic rocks is poorly understood. Recent data, obtained from uniaxial compression experiments on folded gneiss (Agliardi et al., 2014), demonstrated that their brittle failure modes depend upon the arrangement of two anisotropies (i.e. foliation and fold axial planes) and that rock strength correlates with failure mode. Since lithostatic pressure may significantly affect this rock behavior, we investigated its effect in triaxial compression experiments. We tested the Monte Canale Gneiss (Italian Alps), characterized by low phyllosilicate content and compositional layering folded at the cm-scale. We used a servo-controlled hydraulic loading system to test 19 air-dry cylindrical specimens (ø = 54 mm) that were characterized both in terms of fold geometry and orientation of foliation and fold axial planes to the axial load direction. The specimens were instrumented with direct contact axial and circumferential strain gauges. Acoustic emissions and P- and S-wave velocities were measured by piezoelectric transducers mounted in the compression platens. The tests were performed at confining pressures of 40 MPa and axial strain rates of 5*10-6 s-1. Post-failure study of fracture mechanisms and related microfabric controls was undertaken using X-ray CT, optical microscopy and SEM. Samples failed in three distinct brittle modes produced by different combinations of fractures parallel to foliation, fractures parallel to fold axial planes, or mm-scale shear bands. The failure modes, consistent with those described in uniaxial compression experiments, were found to be associated with distinct stress-strain and acoustic emission signatures. Failure modes involving quartz-dominated axial plane anisotropy correspond to higher peak strength and axial strain, less brittle macroscopic behavior, and higher and more progressive acoustic emission activity than failure involving mica-dominated foliation anisotropy. Observed micro-scale mechanisms support a decisive control of micro-fabric associated to folding on crack nucleation and propagation, and overall mechanical behavior of rock.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric CO2 content, changing synchronously with temperature over recent glacial cycles, is considered as one of the most important mechanisms regulating climate change. The ocean is the dominant force driving atmospheric CO2 changes in glacial cycles. The CO2 sink of global coastal seas currently comprise 21% of the net sea-air CO2 flux of the global ocean, therefore coastal seas play important role in adjusting atmospheric CO2. The South China Sea (SCS), one of the largest coastal seas separating Asia from the Pacific, currently acts as a source of atmospheric CO2 due to high seawater temperature and intense vertical mixing bringing CO2 of deep sea to the surface.\nWe measured B/Ca ratios in planktonic foraminifers, Globigerinoides ruber and Pulleniatina obliquiloculata, from MD05-2896 located in the southern SCS to reconstruct surface water pH (pHsw) and thermocline water pH (pHtw) and then calculate pCO2 of surface water (pCO2sw) and pCO2 of thermocline water (pCO2tw) over the last glacial cycle. Additionally, Mg/Ca ratios and δ18O were measured in G.ruber and P. obliquiloculata to reconstruct seawater temperature and salinity. The difference of pCO2 between surface water and atmosphere (ΔpCO2sw-atm) were positive during Holocene and from MIS5.1 to MIS5.4, implying that the southern SCS was the source of atmospheric CO2. The Holocene result coincides with the modern observation. During the last glacial period, the southern SCS became the sink of atmospheric CO2, indicated from the negative ΔpCO2sw-atm values.\nWe also discovered that ΔpCO2sw-atm, the difference of pCO2 between thermocline and surface water (ΔpCO2tw-sw) and thermocline water temperature (TWT) have similar change trend, presenting obvious 20,000-year precession cycle. Therefore, we regard TWT as one of the dominant elements effecting the SCS to absorb or release CO2. When TWT were lower during glacial time, the mixed layer was able to dissolve more CO2, with larger ΔpCO2tw-sw, and the surface water tended to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere. Besides, weakened deep ventilation involving vertical mixing and advection in the SCS during the last glacial period was also beneficial for the southern SCS to become the sink of atmospheric CO2.",

            "abstract": "By re-defining ‘excess helium’ as isotopic abundance of both helium isotopes normalized to those of the air, helium-3 and helium-4 in the soil gas stand out as two independent proxies of mantle and crustal degassing in the Yilan Plain, Taiwan. The spatial distribution of soil gas helium-3 correlates well with the locations of both shallow and deep structures; and its extent of anomaly indicates the depth of faults. Helium-3 also points out the locations of the dyke intrusion and the initial depression center of the Plain. Soil gas helium-4, on the other hand, does not reflect structure locations as well as helium-3. We suggest that the faults might have activated long ago so that crustal helium-4 had released to the atmosphere, while helium-3 still has constant supply from the mantle. One prominent feature–obvious abundance difference–shows up in spatial distribution of both helium-3 and helium-4 at longitude 121.75°. This feature could only be explained by the appearance of deep tectonic structures since helium-3 is a primordial gas from the deep earth. We believe that it is the location of the sharp plate boundary as proposed by Ustaszewski et al. (2012). However, we suggest that the location should be in the Plain rather than in the mountain area. The distribution of soil helium-4 also implies that the crustal delamination depth is ranged around 3-14 km, where the major heat-producing elements in the upper crust are heated, and thus enhance crustal degassing. With the new definition of excess helium, we found the interpretation of helium isotopes in soil gas is no longer affected by air contamination. Even soil gas samples are taken from surficial crust; helium isotopes are still useful to trace mantle and crustal degassing and could shed light on tectonic settings.",

            "abstract": "The monitoring of earthquakes with SR has been reported by Nickolaenko and Hayakawa (Nickolaenko and Hayakawa 2014, 2006, Hayakawa 2005). Despite the presence of many SR observatories globally, the observation of SR anomalies caused by earthquakes is rare. And the physical mechanism for the SR anomaly is not clear. Further attention to methods for observing SR anomalies caused by earthquakes is needed. A simulation approach based on Nelson’s 2DTelegraph Equation (TDTE) Network (Nelson, MIT doctoral thesis, 1967) is developed. The Earth-ionosphere cavity is discretized into 24×24 tesserae. This network approach is more flexible than an analytical model, especially for a model with day-night asymmetry. The relation of the magnitude of the anomaly and the geometrical arrangement among source, receiver and disturbed zone is discussed for the uniform model. The perturbed zone size is computed according to the estimated size of the earthquake preparation zone. For example, the radius of the perturbed zone is about 1000km when the earthquake magnitude is about Ms=7.0. The intensity variations for the first four SR modes are compared between perturbed and unperturbed models. In addition, the spectral characteristics at different distances between source and disturbed zone are analysed. Interestingly, the electric field shows different variation than the magnetic field in response to the localized perturbation. For the uniform model with single Q-burst source, when the height of the local ionosphere is decreased, the electric field is increased and reaches nearly 50% in intensity in the perturbed zone in the uniform model. However, in contrast, the magnetic response is far less pronounced. It shows almost no variation. But for multisource excitation, the electric field and magnetic field both show dramatic response which reaches nearly 100% variation for some special modes. And the big variation is not restricted to the perturbed zone. The variations show complicated relationships with the different geometrical arrangements among three sources and receivers.",

            "abstract": "Dust emissions, determined from dust deposition rates in sedimentary archives, are sensitive indicators of landscape change in dust source areas. Changing patterns in dust output are most often interpreted to indicate changing aridity, where increased dust emissions occur in response to increased aridity. However, the controls on the degree of dustiness are complex and in addition to aridity include sediment availability and windiness. Sediment availability is influenced not only by climate, but also landuse. Despite this, dust emissions can be used to reconstruct landscape response through time. Rates of dust deposition downwind of the main dust producing regions of eastern and central Australia are examined in this study. Prior to agricultural development, dust emissions from this region appeared to be driven by changes in the position of synoptic scale circulation features combined with the operation of teleconnections. However, following widespread agricultural development dust output increased significantly, with patterns linked to human activity; although the influence of climate was still apparent. Different dust source regions appear to respond differently to spatial variability in climate. Dust emissions increased from central Australia desert after 4500 cal. BP, interpreted as a response to a northward positioning, and possible strengthening, of the baric ridge. Peak dust emissions from central Australia occurred at around 3500 cal. BP, coincident with a generally dry climate but also apparent peak El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability. High ENSO variability is thought to have driven increased dust emissions as rapid changes between wet and dry sequences resupply sediment to dust source areas during wet phases, before it is entrained and transported during subsequent dry periods. By contrast, at the same time in more southerly latitudes (Australia’s western Murray-Darling Basin (MDB)) dust emissions were lower than at any other time. This is assumed to be associated with increased advection of moisture into the MDB during enhanced westerly circulation inhibiting dust entrainment. The records presented here imply that variability in hydro-climatology and landuse in Australia’s arid-lands have driven changes in dust output of up to ~20 times during the late Holocene.",

We observed PKP precursors from earthquakes in Aleutian Islands and Kamchatka Peninsula recorded by seismic arrays in Antarctica (GAMSEIS and POLENET/ANET) from distance 134-142o. By comparing the CMB entry and exit points of the two sets of earthquakes, we suggest that the precursors are generated by scatterers near the source side entry point. We further analyze the arrival times of PKP precursors and forward model the precursor envelopes. Our preliminary results show that the scatterers are located near the north side of Pacific anomaly, in latitude 30-50°N, and within ~400 km above CMB. Furthermore, the scatterers can be divided into three regions, with 2-3% variation in the middle (160-180°E) and ~1% variation in the other two sides (140-160°E,160-180°W). By further analyzing ScS-S differential traveltime residuals sampling these regions, we argue that the heterogeneous scatterers are probably the remnants of ancient subducted slab.",

            "abstract": "Quantification of H2O contents of natural granites has been an on-going challenge owing to the extremely fugitive character of H2O during cooling and ascent of melts and magmas. Here we approach this problem by studying granites in their source region (i.e. the partially melted continental crust) and we present the first NanoSIMS analyses of anatectic melt inclusions (MI) hosted in peritectic phases of migmatites and granulites. These MI which totally crystallized upon slow cooling represent the embryos of the upper-crustal granites. The approach based on the combination of MI and NanoSIMS has been here tested on amphibolite-facies migmatites at Ronda (S Spain) that underwent fluid-present to fluid-absent melting at ~700 °C and ~5 kbar. Small (≤ 5 µm) crystallized MI trapped in garnet have been remelted using a piston-cylinder apparatus and they show leucogranitic compositions. We measure high and variable H2O contents (mean of 6.5±1.4 wt%) in these low-temperature, low-pressure granitic melts. We demonstrate that, when the entire population from the same host is considered, MI reveal the H2O content of melt in the specific volume of rock where the host garnet grew. Mean H2O values for the MI in different host crystals range from 5.4 to 9.1 wt%. This range is in rather good agreement with experimental models for granitic melts at the inferred P-T conditions. Our study documents for the first time the occurrence of H2O heterogeneities in natural granitic melts at the source region. These heterogeneities are interpreted to reflect the birth of granitic melts under conditions of “mosaic” equilibrium, where the distinct fractions of melt experience different buffering assemblages at the micro-scale, with concomitant differences in melt H2O content. These results confirm the need for small-scale geochemical studies on natural samples to improve our quantitative understanding of crustal melting and granite formation. The same approach adopted here can be applied to MI hosted in higher-temperature, granulite-facies rocks that represent the parents of many upper-crustal granites. This will result in a better understanding of formation and evolution of granitic magmas. ",

            "abstract": "Freshwater lenses on small islands have been described as some of the most vulnerable aquifer systems in the world. Yet, little guidance is available regarding methods for rapidly assessing the vulnerability of freshwater lenses to the potential effects of climate change. To address this gap we employ a steady-state analytic modelling approach to develop seawater intrusion (SWI) vulnerability indicator equations. The vulnerability indicator equations quantify the propensity for SWI to occur in strip islands due to both recharge change and sea-level rise (SLR) (incorporating the effect of land surface inundation (LSI)). This work extends that of Werner et al. (2012) who developed SWI vulnerability indicator equations for unconfined and confined continental aquifers, and did not consider LSI. Flux-controlled and head-controlled conceptualisations of freshwater lenses are adopted. Under flux-controlled conditions the water table is able to rise unencumbered by land surface effects. Under head-controlled conditions the head is fixed at the centre of the lens due to, for example, centrally located topographic controls, surface water features or pumping. A number of inferences about SWI vulnerability in freshwater lenses can be made from the analysis: (1) SWI vulnerability indicators for SLR (under flux-controlled conditions) are proportional to lens thickness (or volume) and the rate of LSI and inversely proportional to island width; (2) SWI vulnerability indicators for recharge change (under flux-controlled conditions) are proportional to lens thickness (or volume) and inversely proportional to recharge; (3) SLR has greater impact under head-controlled conditions rather than flux-controlled conditions, whereas the opposite is the case for LSI and recharge change. Example applications to several case studies illustrate use of the method for rapidly ranking lenses according to vulnerability, thereby allowing for prioritisation of areas where further and more detailed SWI investigations may be required.\n",

            "abstract": "Maize (Zea mays L.) is one of the most important crop worldwide. Despite its importance, there is limited information on the function of different root segments and root types of maize in extracting water from soils. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate locations of root water uptake in maize.\nWe used neutron radiography to: 1) image the spatial distribution of maize roots in soil and 2) trace the transport of injected deuterated water (D2O) in soil and roots. Maizes were grown in aluminum containers (40×38×1 cm) filled with a sandy soil. When the plants were 16 days old, we injected D2O into selected soil regions containing primary, seminal and lateral roots. The experiments were performed during the day (transpiring plants) and night (not transpiring plants). The transport of D2O into roots was simulated using a new convection–diffusion numerical model of D2O transport into roots. By fitting the observed D2O transport we quantified the diffusional permeability and the water uptake of the different root segments.\nThe maize root architecture consisted of a primary root, 4-5 seminal roots and many lateral roots connected to the primary and seminal roots. Laterals emerged from the proximal 15 cm of the primary and seminal roots. Water uptake occurred primarily in lateral roots. Lateral roots had the highest diffusional permeability (9.4×10-7), which was around six times higher that the diffusional permeability of the old seminal segments (1.4×10-7), and two times higher than the diffusional permeability of the young seminal segments (4.7×10-7). The radial flow of D2O into the lateral (6.7×10-5 ) was much higher than in the young seminal roots (1.1×10-12). The radial flow of D2O into the old seminal was negligible.\nWe concluded that the function of the primary and seminal roots was to collect water from the lateral roots and transport it to the shoot. A maize root system with lateral roots branching from deep primary and seminal roots would be efficient in extracting water from the subsoil and better tolerate periods of water shortage. However, in this case the xylem axial resistance could be the limiting factor for the uptake of water.",

But there are great challenges in deploying it in real-time river flood forecasting, such as the awesome computation resources requirement, parameter determination, high resolution precipitation assimilation and uncertainty controls. Liuxihe Model is a physically-based distributed hydrological model proposed mainly for catchment flood forecasting, which is a process-based hydrological model. In this study, based on Liuxihe Model, a parallel computation algorithm for Liuxihe model flood forecasting is proposed, and a cloudy computation system is developed on a high performance computer, this largely improves the applicability of Liuxihe Model in large river. Without the parallel computation, the Liuxihe Model is computationally incapable in application to rivers with drainage area bigger than 10,000km2 at the grid size of 100m. With the parallel computation, the Liuxihe Model is used in a river with a drainage area of 60,000km2, and could be expended indefinitely. Based on this achievement, a model parameter calibration method by using Particle Swale Optimization is proposed and tested in several rivers in southern China with drainage areas ranging from several hundreds to tens thousands km2, and with the model parameter optimization, the model performance has been approved largely. The modeling approach is also tested for coupling radar-based precipitation estimation/prediction for small catchment flash forecasting and for coupling quantitative precipitation estimation/prediction from meteorological model for large river flood forecasting.",

            "abstract": "Longitudinal Valley (LV), extended form Hualien to Taitung between the Central Range (CR) and the Coastal Range in the eastern Taiwan, is considered as a plate boundary formed by the convergence between the Eurasian and Philippine Sea plates. Previous studies reveal ~30 mm/yr shortening in the southern part of the LV; however, many interesting tectonic and geologic features in the northern LV are worth to discuss. Our relocation of M>2.0 background seismicity in the northern LV using HypoDD revealed an east dipping LV fault and a west-dipping lineament beneath the middle Central Range, while the lineament gradually becomes horizontal as extended to the east (Fig. 1). In Oct. 31, 2013, a NNE-strike earthquake of Mw=6.4 occurred near the town of Ruisui (Fig. 1), which is the largest event of the northern LV area since the 1972 M=7.2 earthquake. . The focal mechanism indicates that the earthquake is a high angle thrusting fault dipping to west, consistent with the aforementioned west-dipping seismic lineament beneath CR. In this study, we analyzed GPS data from 38 continuous stations together with ERS and Envisat images processed by PSInSAR (Persistent Scatterers InSAR) technique to study the interseismic and the post-Ruisui ground deformation of the northern LV area (Fig. 2). Our geodetic analysis reveal that the GPS horizontal velocity field decreases toward the north from ~25 mm/yr to <10 mm/yr across the latitude of ~23.5°, with a clockwise rotation of velocity directions from northwest to north and further to east in the Hualien area. In addition, the vertical velocities show subsidence in the most of the area with rates up to 10 mm/yr. Moreover, the mean Line of Sight (LOS) velocity of ERS from 1993-2001 reveals subsidence rates of up to 8 mm/yr in the Longitudinal Valley and an uplift up to 5 mm/yr at the west of the Milun fault (Fig. 2). Besides, the 2004-2008 Envisat data show an uplift of ~3 mm/yr in most of the Milun fault area. A couple of two-dimensional dislocation models across northern LV will be construct to better study the interseismic loading of plausible subsurface active structures of the area and the post-seismic fault slips of the 2013 Ruisui earthquake.",

This study presents monthly, seasonal and annual variations in sediment transport (both suspended load and bed load) as well as dissolved loads over three consecutive water years (2008–2011) for two small forested watersheds with contrasting levels of forest disturbance in the Lesser Himalaya of Northwest India. Seasonal and annual suspended sediment yields were strongly influenced by amounts of rainfall and stream flow and showed a 23-fold range between wet and dry years. Of the annual load, some 92% was produced on average during the monsoon season (June–September). Sediment production by the disturbed forest catchment was 2.6-fold (suspended sediment) to 5.9-fold (bed load) higher than that for the well-stocked forest catchment. By contrast, dissolved loads varied much less between years, seasons (although minimal during the dry summer season), and degree of forest disturbance. Total mechanical denudation rates were 1.2 times and 4.7 times larger than chemical denudation rates for the little disturbed and the heavily disturbed forest catchment, respectively whereas overall denudation rates were estimated at 0.59 and 1.05 mm per 1000 years, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Cloud regimes have proved useful in both observational and model evaluation studies to associate patterns of cloud-top properties with key cloud processes and dynamical contexts. Present model evaluation studies either identify cloud regimes directly from simulations, which may differ significantly from observations, or project simulated cloud on to observed cloud regimes using mean cloud-top properties. A remaining challenge for model evaluation is to compare observed and simulated cloud in a way that retains both the observed cloud structures to which we aspire, and the key modes of model bias we seek to diagnose.\nWe present a hybrid approach to identifying cloud regimes for model evaluation using observed and simulated cloud simultaneously. The resultant set of cloud regimes includes predominantly-observed and predominantly-simulated clouds, allowing us to distinguish cloud regimes associated with significant errors in the model from those where simulated clouds resemble observations. This approach permits a more explicit evaluation of major cloud biases while retaining observed links to cloud processes and dynamical contexts.\nIn this study hybrid cloud regimes are used to evaluate the Southern Ocean cloud biases in the Australian Community Climate and Earth-System Simulator (ACCESS). We identify two major sources of error: the model produces optically thin counterparts of observed low and midtopped cloud regimes, especially in the cold-air section of extra-tropical cyclones, which partially compensate for deficits of the latter; and a cloud regime associated warm conveyor belt of extratropical cyclones is not reproduced in any form in the model, contributing significantly to the total SW radiation bias. Finally the hybrid cloud regimes are used to quantify the effects of changes to the model microphysics parametrization, and the major cloud biases are compared against those in several other climate models.",

            "abstract": "Vast areas of the Chatham Rise, east of New Zealand’s South Island, are covered by circular to elliptical seafloor depressions. Distribution and size of these seafloor depressions appear to be linked to bathymetry: Small depressions several hundred meters in diameter are found in a depth range of ~500-800 m while two types of larger depressions with 2-5 km and >10 km in diameter, respectively, are present in water depths of 800-1100 m.\nHere we evaluate 3-D seismic reflection data acquired off the R/V Sonne in 2013 over one of the 2-5 km large depressions. We interpret that the seafloor bathymetry associated with the 2-5 km depressions was most likely created by contour current erosion and deposition. These contourite features are underlain by structures that indicate upward fluid flow, including polygonal fault networks and a conical feature that we interpret to result from sediment re-mobilization. We also discovered a set of smaller buried depressions immediately beneath the contourites. These features are directly connected to the stratigraphy containing the conical feature through sets of polygonal faults which truncate against the base of the paleo-depressions. We interpret these depressions as paleo-pockmarks resulting from fluid expulsion, presumably including gas. Based on interpretation and age correlation of a regional-scale seismic line, the paleo-pockmarks could be as old as 5.5 Ma. We suggest the resulting paleo-topography provided the initial roughness required to form mounded contourite deposits that lead to depressions in seafloor bathymetry.",

            "abstract": "The geodynamic setting of the northern Aegean is governed by the superimposition of NE-SW strike-slip deformation, associated with the propagation of the North Anatolian fault zone towards the west, and N-S extension, caused by the suction of the Aegean realm towards the south due to deep seated processes of trench retreat and slab rollback. The Mygdonia basin sits at the westernmost termination of the Kavala-Xanthi-Komotini fault zone, a structure that is considered the northernmost splay of the North Anatolian fault system in the northern Aegean. It is one of the most seismically active regions in continental northern Greece, and it is herein interpreted, for the first time, as a transtensional pull-apart structure that has been progressively established since the Early Pleistocene by westward directed rupture of NW-SE and NE-SW trending oblique slip normal faults and E-W trending normal faults. The interaction of the two, separate, stress regimes in the basin demands decreasing accumulated displacement from west to east to accommodate clockwise rotation. The close correspondence between analogue models of transtensional basins and the observed spatial distribution of faulting in the Mygdonia basin attests to the importance of oblique deformation in the basin-forming processes. Detailed topographic profiles across the fault-bounded ranges confirm the decreasing trend of accrued displacement from east to west. Furthermore, topographic swaths reveal the scaling of faulting into discrete segments along the basin-bounding ranges, while calcrete maturity on abandoned hanging wall fans reveals a towards-the-west diachronous faulting with associated fan sedimentation. The Early Pleistocene age of the initial fill of the basin complex and fault displacements on the order of many hundreds of meters point to dramatic and rapid landscape forming processes in this tectonically active region. The increasing appreciation of the interaction of both strike-slip deformation and extension better refines our understanding of basin forming events in this region, in contrast to a simplistic, end-member, pure extensional basin model.",

            "abstract": "The delivery of water, sediment and solutes by catchments is influenced by the distribution of source elevations and their travel distances to the outlet. For example, elevation affects the magnitude and phase of precipitation, as well as the climatic factors that govern rock weathering, which influences the particle size and production rate of sediment from slopes. Travel distance, in turn, affects the timing of flood peaks at the outlet and the degree of sediment size reduction by wear, which affect particle size distributions at the outlet. The distributions of elevation and travel distance have been studied extensively but separately, as the hypsometric curve and width function. Yet a catchment can be considered as a collection of points, each with paired values of elevation and travel distance. We refer to the joint distribution of these two fundamental catchment attributes as “catchment power,” recognizing that the ratio of elevation to travel distance is proportional to the average rate of loss of the potential energy provided by source elevation, as water or sediment travel to the outlet. We explore patterns in catchment power across a suite of catchments spanning a range of relief, drainage area and channel network geometry. We also develop an empirical algorithm for generating synthetic catchment power distributions, which can be parameterized with data from natural catchments, and used to explore the effects of varying the shape of the distribution on fluxes of water, sediment, isotopes and other landscape products passing through catchment outlets. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how catchment power distributions arise from the branching properties of networks and the relief structure of landscapes. This new way of quantifying catchment geometry may provide a fresh perspective on problems of both practical and theoretical interest.",

However, there are still a lot of uncertainties in modeling atmospheric. Data assimilation makes use of observation in order to reduce the uncertainties. This paper presents experiments of PM10(particulate matter <10㎛ in diameter) data assimilation with the optimal interpolation method. In order to improve the performance of chemical transport models (CTM) models in predicting pollutant concentrations for PM10, data assimilation techniques can be used. Model (CMAQ : Community Multiscale Air Quality Model) to simulate and assimilate PM10 concentration over Korea peninsula. The observations are provided by AAQMS (Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations in Korea).Data assimilation techniques combine measurements of the pollutant concentrations with model results to obtain better estimates of the true concentration levels(unknown). The method is then applied in operational-forecast conditions. It is found that the assimilation of PM10 observations significantly improves the one-day forecast of PM10, whereas the improvement is non significant for the tow-day forecast. We focus on the horizontal and temporal impacts of the data assimilation. The strategy followed in this paper with the optimal interpolation could be useful for operational forecasts.",

Recent findings at Lake Qinghai show the two systems interplay at glacial/interglacial scales. The climate effect of the monsoon and the Westerlies differs significantly. As the monsoon weakened and retreated gradually during the middle to late Holocene, the convergence zone between the monsoon and the Westerlies would shift correspondingly. However, it is unclear where and when the convergence zone is located on the TP. Lingge Co (88°36’E, 33°51’N) is currently located within the convergence zone between ASM and Westerlies in the Northern Tibetan Plateau (NTP). Sediment core at the lake covering the past 26 kyr would provide critical information on influence of ASM and the Westerlies and reveal their variation since the last deglaciation. We analyzed GDGTs, δ2H of sedimentary leaf waxes, δ18O of ostracod (Leucocythere mirabilis) , sediment grain size and loss on ignition to reconstruct changes in temperature, precipitation isotope ratios, lake water isotope ratios, lake water balance and productivity. The comprehensive records show that the climate was cold and dry during the last deglaciation (~26-12ka), with evident Heinrich 1 and Younger Dryas cooling events, suggesting that the NTP mainly influenced by the Westerlies. During the early Holocene, the climate was warm and wet mainly influenced by ASM. However, significant enrichment in δ2H at ~9-6ka and ~4.5-2ka, as well as increased water energy, reflects the intrusion of Westerlies into the NTP. These two periods are in line with the humid period in Westerlies dominant area. The Lingge Co records demonstrate interplay between ASM and the Westerlies on the NTP during the Holocene, which is critical to understand the mechanisms of climate changes in Tibetan Plateau since the last deglaciation.",

            "abstract": "Since the 20th century, due to the rapid urbanization many urban environment problems have got blossomed and above all heat island has been recognized as an important issue. There are several causes of urban heat island, but land cover change occupies the largest portion of them. Owing to urban expansion, vegetation is changed into asphalt pavements and concrete buildings, which reduces latent heat flux. To mitigate the problems, people enlarge vegetation covers such as planting street trees, making rooftop gardens and constructing parks or install white roofs that feature high albedo on a building. While the white roofs reflect about 70% of solar radiation and absorb less radiation, vegetation has low albedo but cools the air through transpiration and fixes carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. There are some studies concerning which one is more effective to mitigate heat island between the green roof and white roof. This study compares the green roof and white roof and additionally considers carbon fixation that has not been treated in other studies. Furthermore, this study ascertains an efficiency of solar-cell panel that is used for building roof recently. The panel produces electric power but has low albedo which could warm the air. The experiment is conducted at the rooftop in Seoul, Korea and compares green roof (grass), white roof (painted cover), black roof (solar panel) and normal painted roof. Surface temperature and albedo are observed for the four roof types and incoming shortwave, outgoing longwave and carbon flux are measured in green roof solely. In the case of solar panels, the electricity generation is calculated from the incoming radiation. We compute global warming potentials for the four roof types and test which roof type is most effective in reducing global warming potential.",

Those operations were done for data comparison between 2 susceptibilities obtained from different equipment.\nOur goal is to decipher the magnetic susceptibility signal in lake sediments by decomposing the bulk susceptibility signal of a lake sediment sequence into ferromagnetic (χf), dia-/paramagnetic (χp) and superparamagnetic (χsp) components using data from remanent and indused magnetization curves Each of these component has a different origin: paramagnetic minerals are usually attributed to terrigenous sediment input, ferromagnetics are of biogenic origin, and superparamagnetic minerals may be of either biogenic or terrigenous origin.\nComparison between susceptibility measurements of MS2-Bartington susceptometer and of the coercivity spectrometer has shown good correlation. The susceptibility values measured in two different equipment are fairly close and indicate thus the reliability the proposed method. In research also has shown water level changes in Aral Sea based on magnetic susceptibility.\nThe work is performed according to the Russian Government Program of Competitive Growth of Kazan Federal University also by RFBR research projects No. 14-05-31376 – а, 14-05-00785– а.",

            "abstract": "Coupling between the central tropical Pacific (CTP) sea surface temperature (SST) variability and the Antarctic stratosphere known from previous studies is analysed using a lagged correlation method. Monthly mean total ozone from the Merged Ozone Data Set and sea surface and stratospheric temperatures from the NCEP–NCAR reanalysis over the 1979–2011 period are used. Indices for their interannual variability were created and sequential lagged correlation ‘index – temperature field’ was used to both identify spatial patterns of the coupled regions and determine time lag of maximum correlation. It has been revealed that interannual SST variations in a westward-oriented V-shaped pattern in the CTP region are associated with statistically significant positive signals in zonally asymmetric region of the Antarctic stratosphere. The CTP index (CTPI) in this work characterizes the CTP SST variations in a domain 160–220°E, 30°N–20°S, which is close to the standard Niño-4 domain by longitude but is five times wider by latitude. The strongest correlation between the CTPI in June and total ozone/stratospheric temperature is found in October (r = 0.7, see figure). In figure the lagged cross correlation between the T50- and TOC-indices in October (solid and dashed curves, respectively) and the CTPI with a time lag from 0 to –12 months) are shown. Vertical line is at the month of correlation peak (CTPI in June, –4 months) and horizontal line marks the 95% confidence level at r= 0.37. Concurrent teleconnection in winter and spring between the identified regions is negligible and, thus, the results suggest about four month delay in signal propagation between the CTP and Antarctic stratosphere. The importance of the off-equatorial tropical SST variability in the V-pattern (i.e. poleward of the standard Niño-4 domain) for the delayed response of the Antarctic stratosphere is emphasized. Possible causes of the V-pattern formation and related response delay are discussed briefly.\nAcknowledgements.

            "abstract": "Three-dimensional full-waveform inversion (FWI) is a high-resolution, high-fidelity, quantitative, seismic imaging technique that has advanced rapidly within the oil and gas industry. The method involves the iterative improvement of a starting model using a series of local linearized updates to solve the full non-linear inversion problem. During the inversion, forward modeling employs the full two-way three-dimensional heterogeneous anisotropic acoustic or elastic wave equation to predict the observed raw field data, wiggle-for-wiggle, trace-by-trace. The method is computationally demanding; it is highly parallelized, and runs on large multi-core multi-node clusters. A recently developed adaptive version of FWI is able to overcome the requirement for a good starting model and low frequencies in the data, and this opens up the range of datasets and problems to which FWI can be applied.\nHere, we demonstrate what can be achieved by applying this newly practical technique to high-density 3D seismic datasets acquired to image petroleum targets. We show that the resulting anisotropic p-wave velocity models match in situ measurements in boreholes, reproduce detailed structure observed independently on high-resolution seismic reflection sections, accurately predict the raw seismic data, and simplify and sharpen reverse-time-migrated reflection images of deeper horizons. The velocity models image individual faults, gas clouds, channels, and other geological features with previously unobtainable resolution and clarity. These same benefits can be obtained when this technique is applied to scientific targets provided that the data coverage is adequate in three-dimensions, and that an appropriate range of offsets and azimuths are available. Possible targets range from the water column, ice sheets, and Holocene deposits, through active faults, spreading centres, collision zones, rifted margins, magma plumbing, lower-continental crust, and deep crustal hot zones, to whole subduction zones, local and regional mantle heterogeneity, and the deep Earth.",

            "abstract": "The first author has been developing RSEM crop-monitoring system using satellite-based assessment of photosynthesis, incorporating meteorological conditions. Crop production comprises of several stages and plural mechanisms based on leaf photosynthesis, surface energy balance, and the maturing of grains after fixation of CO2, along with water exchange through soil vegetation-atmosphere transfer.\nGrain production in prime countries appears to be randomly perturbed regionally and globally. Weather for crop plants reflects turbulent phenomena of convective and advection flows in atmosphere and surface boundary layer. It has been difficult for scientists to simulate and forecast weather correctly for sufficiently long terms to crop harvesting. However, severely poor harvests related to continental events must originate from a consistent mechanism of abnormal energetic flow in the atmosphere through both land and oceans.\nIt should be remembered that oceans have more than 100 times of energy storage compared to atmosphere and ocean currents represent gigantic energy flows, strongly affecting climate. Anomalies of Sea Surface Temperature (SST), globally known as El Niño, Indian Ocean dipole, and Atlantic Niño etc., affect the seasonal climate on a continental scale. The authors aim to combine monitoring and seasonal forecasting, considering such mechanisms through land-ocean biosphere transfer.\nThe present system produces assessments for all continents, specifically monitoring agricultural fields of main crops. Historical regions of poor and good harvests are compared with distributions of SST anomalies, which are provided by NASA GSFC. Those comparisons fairly suggest that the Worst harvest in 1993 and the Best in 1994 relate to the offshore distribution of low temperature anomalies and high gaps in ocean surface temperatures. However, high-temperature anomalies supported good harvests because of sufficient solar radiation for photosynthesis, and poor harvests because of insufficient precipitation. Integrated rates of photosynthesis on prime grains with planted areas were compared with the SST anomalies in poor and good harvests years. Other factors for poor harvest such as rainfall, solar radiation in addition to the intensity of winds as a measure of pressure perturbations need to be studied.",

Although it was identified early on as an example of a strike-slip fault in the north of Hispaniola, its structure and rate of motion remains poorly constrained. We present the first direct evidence for active sinistral strike-slip motion along this fault, based on swath seafloor mapping of the northern Haiti area. There is evidence for ~16.5 km of apparent strike-slip motion along the mapped segment of the Septentrional fault zone off Cap Haitien town which is terminated to the east onland Dominican republic and in the west to southern Cuban margin. By evaluating these new constraints within the context of geodetic models of global plate motions, we estimate an activity of the fault since 2 Ma with an angular velocity for the Caribbean plate relative to the North America predicted 6–12 mmyr−1 sinistral motion along the Septentrional fault zone. This transform fault was initiated around 20 million years ago in its western segment and since 2 Ma in its eastern segment in response to a regional reorganization of plate velocities and directions, which induced a change in configuration of plate boundaries.",

We estimate the source parameters of the earthquakes by following a two-step Bayesian approach allowing the determination of the scalar seismic moment (M0), corner frequency (fc) and their associated uncertainties. First, M0 is computed from the amplitude of the low frequency part of the P and S spectrum. Second P and S fc are estimated by inverting ratios between seismic displacement spectra of nearby located earthquakes, which eliminates the trade-off between fc and anelastic attenuation. The magnitudes scale between 1.20 and 2.76. The source lengths globally range between 100 and 400 m. Deviation from the self-similarity is observed: most of the events have a source length around 150m for earthquakes with Mw ≤ 1.8. Stress drops are rather low, between 0.1 and 1 MPa, suggesting high pore pressure. We show that the number of ruptures and the cumulated coseismic slip are maximal at the center of the multiplet which suggests that the multiplet is a weak seismogenic patch surrounded by a locked fault.\nIn a second part, we focus on the seismic crisis occurring from October 2003 to July 2004 in the western part of the Corinth Rift. During this period, 24 major multiplets were activated (411 events, Mw ≤ 2.9). We show that the seismic crisis is related to the activation in depth of 2 main faults mapped on the southern coast of the Gulf. The spatio-temporal analysis of the multiplets displays an overall migration from south-east to north-west. We demonstrate that this migration is compatible with pore pressure diffusion law. We also highlight intra-multiplet diffusions on 18 multiplets. Diffusivities range between 0.001 to 0.4 m2/s and seem to be correlated with the multiplet size. Estimation of source rupture lengths show that some multiplets have partial source overlapping which suggests mechanical interactions. Other multiplets have strong source overlapping with regular ruptures suggesting repeated breaks of same asperities driven by creep.\nFinally, we present preliminary analysis of data recorded by 3 strainmeters deployed on the northern coast of the Gulf. We seek signatures of seismic crisis (like 2003-2004) in strain recordings.",

However, the orthogonal grid-lines have dramatic convergence and divergence above the steep terrain which restricts the time step and increases the numerical errors as pointed out by Li et al. (2014). In this study, we first investigate the quality of these orthogonal terrain-following grids in terms of the skewness, smoothness and aspect ratio, and their effects on reducing the advection errors. And then we design a hyperbolic rotation parameter b for the OS-coordinate instead of the power b used by Li et al. (2014) to create the new computational grids which have less convergence and divergence near the steep terrain. Finally, we use the OS-coordinate with the hyperbolic b to implement the Schär-type experiments as in Li et al. (2014) and then analyze the computational stability and the numerical accuracy relative to the OS-coordinate with the power b. The experimental results show that the hyperbolic b can control the distance of the neighbour grid-lines better than the power b, therefore alleviating the restriction of the time step in the OS-coordinate and also improving the performance of the OS-coordinate in reducing the advection errors.",

To characterize and understand the influence of mesoscale eddies on planktonic ecosystems in the California Current System (CCS) we use a numerical approach coupling the Regional Ocean Modeling system (ROMS), at 5 km horizontal resolution, with a multiple size class planktonic ecosystem model (NEMURO). Combining Eulerian and Lagrangian analyses, we were able to follow one specific cyclonic eddy formed in the Southern California Bight as it detached from the coast and migrated offshore. Lagrangian particle tracking allowed us to identify the eddy core where high concentrations of coastal nutrients are found. The Eulerian calculations allowed us to quantify ecosystem properties and dynamics along the particle tracks. We highlight the role of this eddy in altering local planktonic ecosystem dynamics, and contrast those dynamics with the coastal upwelling source waters, and the waters encircling the eddy.",

Understanding the nitrogen retention characteristics along the river network is important for land management in order to implement water resources protection. This study employs a geomorphology based non-point source pollution (GBNP) model to simulate the hillslope hydrological processes, sediment and pollutants transportation in the upper Xin’anjiang catchment in recent 10 years from 2001 to 2010. Calibration and validation of the GBNP model are carried out carefully using the observed discharge, sediment and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations at several hydrological gauges, and then the simulated results of the whole catchment are used to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of nitrogen along the river networks with emphasis on its retention characteristics. The simulated results indicate that annual TN loaded from the hillslopes in the study catchment ranges from nearly 4000 ton to 11,000 ton and relatively higher TN load occurred in spring and summer. Average TN loads from hillslopes have significant positive correlation with the irrigated-cropland area (correlation coefficient =0.820), and significant negative correlation with the area of forest and grassland (correlation coefficient =-0.427 and -0.246). Seasonal nitrogen retention ratio in the river networks of study catchment in last 10 years varies from 0%-81%, and the streams of order 1 in the Horton-Strahler ordering system has the highest retention ratio and is followed by order 2, order 3 and order 4. The results also indicate that nitrogen retention ratio has positive correlation with river length and negative correlation with discharge and velocity. Scenario analysis of fertilizer application demonstrates that the nitrogen retention ratio increases logarithmically with the TN load and reach a maximum value rapidly.",

            "abstract": "How large can temporal variations in interseismic deformation rates be? Meltzner et al. (2014, in review) reported that fossil coral microatolls on Simeulue and the Banyak Islands of Sumatra, Indonesia, show contemporaneous temporal variations in interseismic subsidence rates. For example, a fossil coral microatoll located at Bangkaru, in the Banyak Islands, reveals interseismic subsidence for a 10-year period between 1956 and 1966, followed by a reversal to interseismic uplift for ~ 15 years from 1966 to 1981, before reverting back to interseismic subsidence after 1981. These temporal variations can neither be accounted for by regional or local sea level changes, nor by postseismic deformation following major historic megathrust earthquakes. These coral observations span a period of ~ 260 years. Such an extensive temporal record of interseismic deformation at subduction zones is rare, and it offers us a unique opportunity to better understand what physical processes likely control the behavior of this portion of the megathrust.\nIn this study, we use elastic dislocation models to explore the extent to which the observed spatio-temporal variations can be consistently explained by tectonic processes. Possible processes include temporal changes in either the width of the locked fault zone or the interseismic coupling coefficient, and/or slow-slip event occurrence. Our models incorporate a realistic fault dip geometry and subduction rate. Our results suggest that a change in the width of the locked zone with time can explain temporal variations in interseismic subsidence rates on Simeulue Island. In addition, the reversal of the sense of vertical displacement at Bangkaru can be explained by the occurrence of a large, long, slow-slip event on the underlying megathrust.",

            "abstract": "Although much of the deformation associated with Arabia-Eurasia collision and Aegean extension is expressed by westward translation of Central Anatolia along the North Anatolian and East Anatolian fault zones, important deformation also takes place in the interior. Major interior faults include the NE-SW striking, left-lateral Central Anatolian fault zone (CAFZ), which splays from the NAFZ, and the NW-SE striking, right-lateral Tuz Gölü fault zone (TGFZ). We examine fault kinematics and river incision in the triangular region bound by the TGFZ to the SW, the CAFZ to the E and the Salanda graben to the N, in order to document fault interaction and landscape development where these fault systems intersect. We document deformation in the footwall of the Tuz Gölü fault, recorded by the warping of ignimbrite and lacustrine units. We investigate the Salanda fault, which displaces a 1.23 Ma basalt flow by 40 m. Paleostress analysis indicates two deformation phases with maximum strain nearly parallel (191 for extension; 183 for shortening).The Salanda fault reactivates older mylonite near the town of Karaburna. We map faults in the interior of this region, including the N-S striking Derinkuyu fault and the newly identified Derbentbaşi fault. The Derinkuyu fault has been inactive since emplacement of a lava dome at its north end. The Derbentbaşi fault offsets lacustrine limestones and older ignimbrites in a right-lateral, west-side down sense prior to regional river incision. Pliocene lacustrine carbonates are largely confined to the hanging walls and footwalls of the TGFZ and the Yeşilhisar strand of the CAFZ; these deposits are deeply incised and can be used to constrain the pattern and timing of river incision. Along the Salanda graben, the Kızılırmak River has incised the surrounding region to a depth of 350 m. Our data suggest a complicated interaction between the TGFZ and CAFZ, with faulting distributed on multiple, obliquely striking structures, few of which remain active today. We also identify an important role for pre-existing weaknesses in governing the location and orientation of faults in this system. We find structural control on the location and/or preservation of lacustrine sedimentation, and evidence for significant recent incision due to regional uplift and local disruption along fault systems.",

            "abstract": "Models of the Earth’s gravitational potential rely on heterogeneous data sets. Typically, regional gravity data with high spatial resolution are combined with low-resolution global observations. We achieve an optimal combination within a regional gravity field modeling approach using radial basis functions, which emphasizes the strengths of each data set. As the resulting regional models contain gravity information from different frequency bands, they can be used as basis for various applications, such as national geoid determination, detection of mass anomalies in the Earth’s interior or determination of mass and height variations at the Earth’s surface.\nWe developed powerful software called “RegGRAV” that enables the flexible combination of high-resolution terrestrial and airborne data, down to mid-resolution altimetry and low-resolution satellite gravimetry measurements. The combination on normal equation level includes a full stochastic model and error propagation. We set up our approach as multi-resolution representation (MRR), i.e. modeling the gravitational potential and decomposing it into frequency-dependent detail signals. The basis functions are defined as spherical wavelet functions and located in the region of interest in such a manner, that the highest measure of information of the input data is captured depending on its spectral sensitivity. After determining the appropriate scaling coefficients of the functions by variance component estimation, any functional of the Earth’s gravity field can be derived, as e.g. geoid heights or gravity anomalies.\nA comparison of the developed MRR to accordingly filtered global gravity field models shows the additional value of our regional approach in the high frequency domain and validates our results. This (1) verifies the consistent estimation of local gravity field parameters for various measurement techniques and (2) enables identifying areas in existing global gravity field models where high-resolution data are missing.",

It was found that the postmidnight enhancement occurred in neutral and ion temperatures over middle and high latitudes with a seasonal dependence. Moreover, the CHAMP neutral density data were used to reveal the averaged patterns of the signature of the MTM, which shows the extension of the nighttime enhancement from the equatorial region to higher latitudes.

            "abstract": "A large number of ancient glass beads dating back from Late Neolithic Age to early Historical Period (ca. 2300-400 BP) of Taiwan have been uncovered from archaeological sites. These glass beads with variant colors, shapes, and stylistics have long been considered to possess socio-cultural significance. Due to the color and chemical composition of glass bead might be determined by raw materials, fluxing agents, colorants, opacifiers and stabilizers. In addition, ancient glass beads are rare and precious, non-destructive analysis has been employed to decipher about the provenances, manufacturing techniques, and exchange/trade routes. In this work, micro-Raman spectroscopy and micro X-ray fluorescent spectrometer (μ-XRF) were used to examine ten ancient glass beads excavated from the Chungde site, Hualien, Taiwan, dating back to 1500-800 BP, to unravel the mineralogical and chemical compositions. Micro Raman experimental results show that glass and anorthite glass are the main constituents accompanying with trace level of quartz, albite, siderite, ankerite, and amazonite. The Raman Index of Polymerization (Ip) indicate that the sintering temperature of the glass beads is in the range of 1000~1400°C. Furthermore, the chemical compositions are corresponding to the maximum stretching vibration peak wave number (νmax Si-O Stretching) and the maximum bending vibration peak wave number (δmax Si-O Bending), which are essentially consistent with that of the India-Pacific beads. The μ-XRF results indicate the presence of oxides including SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, Na2O, K2O, CaO, MgO, SnO2, TiO2, CuO, etc., and could be classified to high aluminum of soda-lime glass system. According to ternary phase diagram analysis of CaO-K2O-Na2O and K2O-Al2O3-CaO, the ancient glass beads analyzed could be attributed to the India-Pacific beads, and is in accordance with that of Raman spectra. The combination of these facts leads to the conclusion that glass beads obtained from the Chungde site may be ascribed to the India-Pacific beads.",

However, whether RAW-based methods can effectively reduce day-to-day variation of LAI time series has not been investigated.\nIn this study, we used two methods to compute gap fraction. The first method separates sky and vegetation pixels using a single threshold in the blue band histogram. The second method interpolates the background sky image from pure sky pixels, and computes the transmittance from original and reconstructed images. In order to investigate which method is more accurate in reducing day-to-day variation of LAI, we first conducted a controlled experiment with punched panels which included different hole size and gap fractions on the rooftop.

            "abstract": "In fracture of rock, radio wave emission was found experimentally [1]. This phenomenon could be used to detect a rock fracture during an earthquake or a volcanic activity [2]. The cause of the radio wave is expected to be micro-discharges, which are generated by an inhomogeneous potential distribution around micro-cracks. In order to better understand the phenomena and clarify the cause of radio wave emission, we carried out experiments to detect the emission in the cases of a collision or contact between various materials. We used receiving systems with great sensitivities and sufficient frequency bandwidths at 1 MHz-, 300 MHz-, 2 GHz-, and 18 GHz-bands. The specimen materials are as follows:\nSteel (2) Brass (3) Copper (4)Small coin (5)Celluloid.\nWe obtained the following results:\nThe signal was detected for the specimen of (1) to (4), but not for (5).\nThe signal is composed of intermittent spikes which include waves with a frequency close to the center frequency of each frequency band.\nThe power is strongest at the lower frequencies among all frequency bands.\nThe more details will be given in the presentation.\nThe origin of radio wave emission from the metal is supposed to be discharges between materials in these experiments. It is surprising that even a small coin can generate a significant amount of radio wave. Accordingly, it is inferred that all amount of charges are discharged through a conductive metal. On the other hand, celluloid did not generate radio wave, though the specimen was sufficiently charged by brushing. It is inferred that a quite localized charge was discharged but the remaining charges were blocked due to poor conductivity. Extending this hypothesis, large-scale contact should have occurred between broken fragments for the radio wave generation in the aforementioned rock fracture experiments. Turbulence of the fragments is a candidate for the explanation.\n[1] K.

These data were obtained during the Mapping phase, at variable spatial resolution (from roughly 100 m/px down to ~10 m/px), illumination conditions, and heliocentric distances (spanning the range from 3.6 to 3.4 AU).\nVIRTIS infrared spectra in the range longward of ~4 µm are affected by the thermal emission of the comet, hence the measured radiance in that spectral region can be used to determine surface temperatures and spectral emissivities by means of temperature-retrieval algorithms. We use a Bayesian approach that was previously applied to Rosetta/VIRTIS data obtained during the close flybys of asteroids 2678 Steins and 21 Lutetia, as well as to the entire dataset of infrared data acquired by the VIR mapping spectrometer aboard the Dawn spacecraft during its orbital phase at asteroid Vesta in 2011-2012.\nThe VIRTIS instrument onboard Rosetta is not sensitive to physical temperatures on the nightside of the comet, where the signal is considerably low. Typically, ~170 K is the minimum temperature that allows one to retrieve surface temperatures while preserving high accuracies. On the other hand, for a given local solar time, the maximum temperature depends on the solar incidence angle and on surface properties such as thermal inertia and albedo.\nThe availability of spatially-resolved, accurate temperature observations, significantly spaced out in local solar time, provides clues to the physical structure of specific surface units, which complements the mineralogical investigation based on imaging spectroscopy data collected at shorter wavelengths.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work is supported by the Italian Space Agency (ASI), ASI-INAF Contract n.

Limited to the Fukue site only, mixing ratios of trace gas species, such as aromatic hydrocarbons, NOx, and NOy, were also measured using GC-FID and NOx and NOyanalyzers for estimation of photochemical age (t[OH]).\nA case study in December 2010 showed that plots of δ13C versus f44 showed systematic variations at Hedo and Fukue. However, their trends were opposite. At Fukue the trend was consistent in the plot of δ13C of LV-WSOC versus t[OH] estimated by the NOx/NOy or the hydrocarbon ratios, indicating influence of SOA. The systematic trends aforementioned qualitatively agreed with a binary mixture model of SOA with background LV-WSOC having the f44 of ~0.06 and the δ13C of -17‰ or higher, implication of some influence of primary emission associated with C4plants.\nGiven that the LV-WSOC at the urban Fukuoka site was a binary mixture, a mass balance for δ13C was constructed below. In the equation, δ13CMix, δ13CLocal, δ13CTrans, and FLocal are δ13C of binary LV-WSOC mixture, δ13C of LV-WSOC from local emission origin, δ13C of LV-WSOC from transboundary pollution origin, and a fraction of LV-WSOC from local emission origin in the mixture, respectively. We applied d13C values at Fukuoka and Fukue to δ13CMix and δ13CTrans, respectively, and δ13C of -27‰ for vehicular emission to δ13CLocal. The preliminary results demonstrated that, except some negative FLocal, the majority of calculated FLocal ranged from 4% to 86% and the lower FLocal, the higher LV-WSOC concentration.",

            "abstract": "The origin of jarosite [KFe3(SO4)2(OH)6] on the Martian surface has been an intriguing problem since the Mars Exploration Rover ‘Opportunity’ first revealed its presence at the Meridiani Planum on Mars. To explain its origin, several terrestrial analogue sites have been studied in different geographical zones. Although several models have been suggested, there is a consensus that only the prevalence of acidic and oxidizing aqueous environmental conditions are conducive to form jarosite. In the Kachchh region of Gujarat, western India, jarosite has been recently discovered from gorges dissecting the Paleocene Matanumadh Formation sediments, that overlie basalts of the Deccan Volcanic Province. This formation comprises pebble conglomerates, carbonaceous shales and purple sandstones capped by a laterite on top. Jarosite, in association with gypsum and goethite, has been detected through FTIR and VNIR spectrometry in almost all litho-units of the succession, albeit in different modes and concentrations. The occurrence of jarosite within black shale in other parts of the world, has been attributed to the oxidation of pyrites within the shale layers. However, in shales of the Matanumadh Formation, jarosite is restricted to fractures that cut across the bedding, while the overlying purple sandstone unit only preserves jarosite in shale clasts within the sandstone. Since the sandstone overlies the black shale layer, downward percolation of sulfate-bearing water from the oxidation of pyrite within the shale layer cannot explain jarosite formation in this unit. In addition, no jarosite is observed below or within pyrite-rich lignite bearing sections in other parts of Kachchh. Alternative suggestions, that jarosite developed in the immediate aftermath of Deccan volcanism as surface waters were rendered acidic by interaction with the final phase of volcanic effusives, are also unlikely as on-going studies suggest that jarosite is not restricted to the Matanumadh Formation. The consistent association of jarosite-bearing horizons with gypsum in Kachchh indicate that saline water intrusion may have played an important role in its formation. Since this association is also reported from the Meridiani Planum, a model explaining the origin of jarosite formation in Kachchh may also be relevant for the Martian surface.",

            "abstract": "Sea level is a very sensitive index of climate change and variability. Sea level integrates the ocean warming, mountain glaciers and ice sheet melting. Understanding the sea level variability and changes implies an accurate monitoring of the sea level variable at climate scales, in addition to understanding the ocean variability and the exchanges between ocean, land, cryosphere, and atmosphere. That is why Sea Level is one of the Essential Climate Variables (ECV) selected in the frame of the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) program. It aims at providing long-term monitoring of the sea level ECV with regular updates, as required for climate studies. The program has just completed its first phase (Oct. 2010 to Dec. 2013) and has started in February 2014 the second phase of 3 years. The objectives of the second phase are to involve the climate research community, to refine their needs and collect their feedbacks on product quality, to develop, test and select the best algorithms and standards to generate an updated climate time series and to produce and validate the Sea Level ECV product. This will better answer the climate user needs by improving the quality of the Sea Level products and maintain a sustain service for an up-to-date production. To this extent, a temporal extension of the ECV will be delivered at the end of 2014 so that the covered period becomes 1993-2013.\nWe will firstly present the main achievements of the ESA CCI Sea Level Project. On the one hand, the major steps required to produce the 18 years climate time series (delivered in Sept. 2012) are briefly described: collect and refine the user requirements, development of adapted algorithms for climate applications and specification of the production system. On the other hand, the product characteristics are described as well as the results from product validation, performed by several groups of the ocean and climate modeling community. At last, the work plan and key challenges of the second phase of the project are described.",

However, the microbial communities that drive deep-subsurface geochemical processes are vastly unexplored. In this study, the bacterial community structure in the subsurface of the South China Sea were examined using sediment cores collected from shelf (water depth 667 m) to slope (water depth 3840 m). High-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes from the sediment samples resulted in a total of 270,000 sequences with each sample averaging about 10,000 sequences. In all sediment cores, the 16S rRNA gene copies of bacteria were highest in the surface sediment and decreased with the core depth. The bacterial community was dominated by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes. In most of the sediment cores, Proteobacteria dominated surface sediment samples and decreased with depth. The community structure showed no significant difference among the stations at different water depths, which indicates that bacterial distribution in the sediment is not influenced by the water column above. However, stations along the transect from Pearl River canyon to the deep basin were grouped together by cluster analysis, which indicates that bacterial community structure at these stations may bear the same consequence of sedimentary processes of the deep South China Sea.",

            "abstract": "The Main Frontal Thrust (MFT) represents the most frontal surface expression of the Himalayan orogen. It is contained within the Miocene-Holocene age Siwalik Group. To better constrain the sub-surface geometry and slip history of the MFT, we conducted seismic reflection surveys around the town of Bardibas in central Nepal. Previous surveys in the area have used surface data and shallow trenches to identify the surface rupture of the great 1934 earthquake. The seismic surveys are intended to (1) confirm that the rupture identified at the surface is a through-going feature at depth; (2) image the geometry and infer the kinematics of the fault to assess the behaviour of the fault at longer timescales, and (3) evaluate how the many surface fault strands interact at depth. The surveys were conducted using a 6300 kg vibroseis minibuggy during January-March, 2014. 34 km of data were acquired in 3 long transects across the Main Frontal Thrust. The data were acquired using 264 channels with 5 m spacing. Vertical stacks of 6-12 sweeps were done at each station to improve the signal to noise ratio of the data. The seismic lines follow several of the dry riverbeds in the area and are generally orthogonal to the range front. The three seismic lines encompass a ~5 km southward step in the deformation front, with the front extending further south on the eastern side. We acquired one line on each side of the step (~2-3 km away) and the central line at the step. The Siwalik Group is strongly folded in this region. Measurements of bedding attitudes were done throughout the area to complement the seismic data. The bedding planes are generally tilted to the NE with a NW-SE strike. The faults at the surface are mostly ENE-WSW. This discrepancy seems to be spatially correlated with the southward step. Folding near the outcropping faults is asymmetric, typically with steep, narrow forelimbs and shallow, wide back-limbs. The river terraces, however, are sub-horizontal and uplifted over large areas, although in a few locations they are also gently folded. This difference suggests a transition from fault-propagation folding to translation along the fault sometime before the formation of the terraces. We expect to use the cross-sections obtained from the seismic data to generate a pseudo-3D view of the fault system in the area to further constrain this transition.",

            "abstract": "Unlike symmetric magnetic reconnection, which has been extensively studied over the last decades despite of its rather rareness in space thanks to its relatively intuitiveness, occurrence of strong asymmetric conditions in specific quantities still have to be fully understood. Only recently these new configuration has become of particular interest, mostly in light of the upcoming MMS NASA mission.\nIn improving this knowldege, this work aim thereby at going deeper into detail on the kinetic properties of asymmetric magnetic reconnection applied to some realistic case, such as the dayside magnetopause. Here, low magnetic field and high density magnetosheath plasma comes in contact with high magnetic field and low density magnetosphere plasma. For now, temperature along both regions is kept constant, as often considered in literature.\nAnalysis are performed using the fully kinetic implicit code iPIC3D which allows us to go down at electron kinetic levels within an acceptable computational time, as well as considering considerably larger spatial domains. These hallmarks enable us to use this code for multifolds applications, either in space or space industry. However, the presence of strong gradients, such as on plasma density, makes the computational effort even more extreme, though still fully manageable by iPIC3D.\nBesided the well-known asymmetric bulges development and the X-line displacement occurring during asymmetric reconnection, one of the first attempt has been to set a very steep gradient to both density and magnetic field outside the current sheet, albeit in compliance of the necessary total pressure balance, simulating thus an eventual intensive and sudden plasma inflow. It is then showns that this particular condition leads to the formation of multiple irregular reconnective points right on the steep gradient. Additionally, marks of electron holes seem to manifest specially along the separatrixes.\nFinally, it is doubtless that plenty of physics lies underneath asymmetric conditions. Most of the work done with the symmetric case has to be transposed to these new configurations in order to assess physical behaviors on more realistic conditions, which may lead to completely and unexpected results.",

            "abstract": "P-wave velocity is an important parameter to estimate gas hydrate saturation in sediments. In this study, the relationship between gas hydrate saturation and P-wave velocity have been analyzed using natural hydrate-bearing-sediments obtained in the Eastern Nankai Trough, Japan. The sediment samples were collected by the Hybrid Pressure Coring System developed by Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology during June-July 2012, aboard the deep sea drilling vessel CHIKYU. P-wave velocity was measured on board by the Pressure Core Analysis and Transfer System developed by Geotek Ltd. The samples were maintained at a near in-situ pressure condition during coring and measurement. After the measurement, the samples were stored core storage chambers and transported to MHRC under pressure. The samples were manipulated and cut by the Pressure-core Non-destructive Analysis Tools or PNATs developed by MHRC. The cutting sections were determined on the basis of P-wave velocity and visual observations through an acrylic window equipped in the PNATs. The cut samples were depressurized to measure gas volume for saturation calculations. It was found that P-wave velocity correlates well with hydrate saturation and can be reproduced by the hydrate frame component model. Using pressure cores and pressure core analysis technology, nondestructive and near in-situ correlation between gas hydrate saturation and P-wave velocity can be obtained.

            "abstract": "Pyroclastic density currents are the largest threat from volcanoes. Direct observations of natural flows are persistently prevented because of their violence and remain limited to broad estimates of bulk flow behaviour. The Pyroclastic Flow Generator – a large-scale experimental facility to synthesize hot gas-particle mixture flows scaled to pyroclastic flows and surges – allows investigating the physical processes behind PDC behaviour in safety. The ability to simulate natural eruption conditions and to view and measure inside the hot flows allows deriving validation and calibration data sets for existing numerical models, and to improve the constitutive relationships necessary for their effective use as powerful tools in hazard assessment.\nWe here report on a systematic series of large-scale experiments on up to 30 ms-1 fast, 2-4.5 m thick, 20-35 m long flows of natural pyroclastic material and gas. We will show high-speed movies and non-invasive sensor data that detail the internal structure of the analogue pyroclastic flows. The experimental PDCs are synthesized by the controlled ‘eruption column collapse’ of variably diluted suspensions into an instrumented channel. Experiments show four flow phases: mixture acceleration and dilution during free fall; impact and lateral blasting; PDC runout; and co-ignimbrite cloud formation. The fully turbulent flows reach Reynolds number up to 107 and depositional facies similar to natural deposits.\nIn the PDC runout phase, the shear flows develop a four-partite structure from top to base: a fully turbulent, strongly density-stratified ash cloud with average particle concentrations <<1vol%; a transient, turbulent dense suspension region with particle concentrations between 1 and 10 vol%; a non-turbulent, aerated and highly mobile dense underflows with particle concentrations between 40 and 50 vol%; and a vertically aggrading bed of static material. We characterise these regions and the exchanges of energy and momentum through their interfaces via vertical time-series profiles of velocity, particle concentration, gas and particle transport directionality and turbulent eddy characteristics. We highlight the importance of each region for the PDC runout dynamics and introduce a new transport and sedimentation model for downslope evolving pyroclastic flows.",

            "abstract": "The CHAMP magnetic data indicate that small amplitude (1-5 nT) magnetic fluctuations with period around a few tens of seconds along the orbit exist globally and almost all the time. Characteristics of the magnetic fluctuations including seasonal dependence having geographical characteristics strongly suggest that they are the small-scale spatial structure of field-aligned currents with lower atmospheric origin (Nakanishi et al., 2014). We suppose that gravity waves generated by lower atmospheric disturbances propagate to the ionosphere and drive the E-layer dynamo. The currents in the ionosphere divert along the magnetic field into the other hemisphere and make a closed circuit.\nTo confirm the above scenario and to find the scale of the current circuit in longitudinal direction, we use the magnetic data observed by the SWARM satellites. By analysis of the magnetic data observed by the SWARM satellites, the magnetic fluctuations as recorded earlier by CHAMP are confirmed to have the same characteristics i.e., the magnetic fluctuation is perpendicular to the geomagnetic field; the amplitude on the dayside is much larger than that on the nightside; towards the dip equator the period tends to get longer.\nBecause the three Swarm satellites have various spatial relations in 3-D space between their orbits, we could easily confirm that the objective magnetic fluctuations are not temporal but spatial structures. The longitudinal scale seems to be of the order of 100 km. We shall show the above results and some other characteristics of the current circuit and discuss whether or not our suggested model fits the observed characteristics.",

            "abstract": "Various dynamic models have been proposed to explain deformation history and topographic evolution for the southern Altiplano-Puna Plateau, including inversion of the Cretaceous Salta rift structures, formation of an orogenic wedge, flat subduction, climate-tectonic coupling, and lithospheric foundering. Controversies persist in the southern Puna Plateau, where preexisting rift structures are unknown and Cenozoic shortening events are sparsely documented. The 6-km high Sierra Laguna Blanca (LB) (NW Argentina) is among the most outstanding topographic features in the interior of the southern Puna Plateau. We document cooling history for LB with apatite (U-Th)/He, apatite fission-track and zircon (U-Th)/He thermochronometers for a vertical profile from 3.6-5.6 km on its eastern flank. Preliminary results from apatite fission-track (AFT) analysis yield ages ranging from 45-65 Ma, with top samples being the oldest. Dpar values for all samples are low (1.54 to 1.74), suggesting a relatively low-temperature partial annealing zone. All samples have shortened mean track lengths ranging from 10.9 to 12.3 micrometers, suggesting partial resetting. Preliminary apatite U-Th/He (AHe) ages are compatible with AFT ages but are widely dispersed, perhaps due to U zoning and small U-rich inclusions which have been observed on AFT external detectors. Inverse modeling of AFT data and selected AHe data using the HeFTy program reveal two major cooling events for LB. All models start ~90-70 Ma and immediately decrease their temperatures to ~60°C before ~50 Ma. Samples may have stayed ~60°C without additional thermal events until ~15-10 Ma, when the most recent cooling event took place, bringing all samples to surface temperature. Our first finding is that the interior of the southern Puna Plateau may have been influenced by the Salta Rift during the Cretaceous, extending the known zone of influence further west. Second, the most recent cooling phase (mid-late Miocene) is consistent with out-of-sequence deformation in the southern Puna Plateau, which might be genetically linked to a proposed lithospheric dripping event.",

            "abstract": "One of the biggest environmental concerns caused by coal-fired power plants is the emission of mercury (Hg). Worldwide, 475 tons of Hg are released from coal-burning processes annually, comprising 24% of total anthropogenic Hg emissions. Because of the high toxicity of Hg species, US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed a standard on Hg and air toxic pollutants (Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, MATS) for new and existing coal-fired power plants in order to eliminate Hg in flue gas prior to release through the stack. To control the emission of Hg from coal-derived flue gas, it is important to understand the behavior, speciation of Hg as well as the interaction between Hg and solid materials, such as fly ash or metal oxides, in the flue gas stream. In this study, theoretical investigations using density functional theory (DFT) were carried out in conjunction with experiments to investigate the adsorption behavior of oxidized Hg on hematite (α-Fe2O3), an important mineral component of fly ash which readily sorbes Hg from flue gas.\nFor DFT calculation, the two α-Fe2O3 (1-102) surfaces modeled consisted of two different surface terminations: (1) M2-clean, which corresponds to the oxygen-terminated surface with the first layer of cations removed and with no hydroxyl groups and (2) M2-OH2-OH, which has bihydroxylated top oxygen atoms and a second layer of hydroxylated oxygen atoms. These surface terminations were selected because both surfaces are highly stable in the temperature range of flue gases. The most probable adsorption sites of Hg, Cl and HgCl on the two α-Fe2O3 surface terminations were suggested based on calculated adsorption energies. Additionally, Bader charge and projected density of states (PDOS) analyses were conducted to characterize the oxidation state of adsorbates and their bonding interactions with the surfaces. Results indicate that oxidized Hg physically adsorbs on the M2-clean surface with a binding energy of -0.103 eV and that chlorine added to the Hg-adsorbed surface enhances Hg adsorption, which is evidenced by a shorter Hg-surface interaction distance compared to a surface with singly bound Hg. Bader charge and PDOS analyses also suggest that a higher surface charge transfer and bonding interaction occur when we added Cl to the system, which increases the stability of Hg the surface.",

            "abstract": "Detailed analysis of the seismicity and seismic velocity structure of the crust surrounding the central Alpine Fault is being undertaken in conjunction with a broad range of other scientific activities under the auspices of the Deep Fault Drilling Project (DFDP). Drilling of the 1.3 km DFDP-2 borehole is scheduled to commence in the Whataroa Valley in October 2014. In preparation, several seismometers in the temporary network surrounding the valley have been equipped with cellular modems to enable telemetered data acquisition and distribution via the national geophysical monitoring network (GeoNet). Real-time analysis of seismicity within c. 20 km of the DFDP-2 drill-site will be performed prior to and during the drilling operations using RTQuake. Additionally, records obtained since 2008 have been re-analysed and supplemented with new data using standard earthquake detection techniques (sta/lta) and manual picking, and automatic detection via cross-correlation waveform matching. The results of this analysis are being integrated with newly developed P- and S-wave tomographic velocity models to refine hypocenters and earthquake magnitudes in the vicinity of the DFDP-2 borehole and elucidate spatiotemporal patterns of seismicity. Seismicity near DFDP-2 is sparse and of low magnitude: analysis of seven months’ data recorded by an extensive network in 2013 including four shallow borehole seismometers within 1.5 km of the drill-site revealed fewer than 40 earthquakes within 10 km of the drill-site. Of these, all but two earthquakes (M=2.6 located c. 6 km northwest of DFDP-2, and M=1.7 located c. 3.5 km north of DFDP-2) were deeper than 2 km and all but five were deeper than 3 km. Preliminary cross-correlation detection work using 14 template events and one year’s continuous data reveals on-going clustered activity. In particular, many newly detected events are observed close to a c. 10 km-deep cluster near Gaunt Creek known to produce fault zone guided waves (FZGWs). This demonstrates that waveform matching works well even when waveform complexity is high and highlights the potential for using repeated earthquakes occurring on or near the Alpine Fault to study temporal changes in fault zone properties late in the earthquake cycle.",

The geological structure is complicated and volcanic activity is strong. In this region, two major geologic and geophysical boundaries are distinct, the NNE-trending North South Gravity Lineament (NSGL) and Tanlu fault. With respect to North China Craton (NCC), Northeast China is more closely adjacent to the subduction zone of Pacific slab, along the eastern boundary of Northeast China the subducting Pacific plate approaches depths of 600 km, many deep earthquakes often occurred here, thus, this region become an ideal place to investigate deep structure related to deep subduction, deep earthquakes as well as intraplate volcanism. In this study, we determined high-resolution three dimensional P- and S-wave velocity models of the crust and upper mantle to 800 km depth by jointly inverting arrival times from local events and relative residuals from teleseismic events recorded by more than 400 seismic stations which belong to the six regional seismic Networks and a PASSCALL temporary array (NECESSArray). Our results show that main velocity anomalies exhibited block feature and are generally oriented in NE to NNE direction, which is consistent with regional tectonic direction. The NSGL is characterized by a high-velocity (high-V) anomaly belt with a width of approximately 100 km, and the high-V anomaly extents to the bottom of upper mantle or mantle transition zone. The songliao basin, which is located between NSGL and Tanlu fault tectonic boundaries, obvious low-velocity anomaly extends to about depth of 200 km. Under the Great Xing’an Range on the west side of NSGL, the velocity is slightly low in the lithosphere. Our results also revealed that most of deep earthquakes all occurred in deep subduction zone with high-velocity anomaly，but in the subduction zone with low-velocity, almost deep earthquakes have not occurred. Further, we also observed that extensive low velocity exists above deep-earthquakes zones, this result suggests that deep subduction of the Pacific slab maybe affect overlying lithosphere, resulting in the state of molten, semi-molten or high water.",

The information of the inner core boundary can help us understand the driving forces of the outer core convection and the evolution history of the Earth. We study the inner core properties by analyzing the travel time and waveform of the compressional waves reflected off the inner core surface (PKiKP) recorded in the pre-critical epicentral distances. We collect the large datasets recorded in two dense seismic arrays in Japan (Hi-net) and the United States of America (USArray) from 2004 to 2014, and perform a systematic search for high-quality pre-critical PKiKP phases. The PKiKP-PcP differential time residuals exhibit large variations in some regions indicating presence of irregular topography and nearly no variations in some other regions suggesting a flat boundary. In some regions, the comparison of PKiKP and PcP waveforms constrains the thickness of the inner core boundary to be no more than 3 km, and in combination with the PKiKP/PcP relative amplitude ratios, the inner core boundary density jump to be 0.6~1.8 g/cm3. We present geographic variation of seismic properties in various regions of the inner core boundary and discuss its possible implications to the thermodynamic behaviors of the inner core boundary.",

            "abstract": "Detailed paleomagnetic studies of lunar samples shed light on the existence and timing of the ancient lunar dynamo, with insights to the inner structure and thermal evolution of the Moon, as well as constraints for the lunar dynamo models [e.g., 1-6]. However these studies are usually performed on small cm-scale samples, typically below 100 mg. Such a small size, combined with anisotropy and other spurious effects have been shown to be the source of additional complexity [7].\nWe measured the natural remanent magnetization and magnetic susceptibility of 105 large Apollo samples (mass range 40 g to 2.9 kg, median mass 350 g). For this, following the approach utilized for the initial paleomagnetic evaluation of Apollo 11 samples [8], we developed a dedicated magnetometer using a fluxgate sensor and a rotating stage, which allowed measuring the bulk samples in their original Teflon and aluminum packaging under nitrogen atmosphere.\nDespite a number of caveats (no demagnetization steps, existence of viscous magnetization and other soft secondary magnetization), the ratio of natural remanent magnetization to susceptibility gives a rough estimate of the paleointensity. The evolution of the paleointensity with the estimated age of the samples will provide a broad picture of the evolution of the lunar dynamo. Susceptibility, as a proxy to the bulk metal content in lunar rocks [9], is also a valuable source of information per se but is currently available only for a small fraction of the Apollo collection. Our survey will allow identification of rocks with unusual magnetic properties, and therefore potentially unusual petrogenesis.\n",

Assuming Bio-CCS site, CO2 is injected from a well for to abate greenhouse gas emission and cultivate methanogenic geo-microbes, and CH4 is produced from another well. The procedure is similar to the Enhanced Oil/Gas Recovery (EOR/EGR) operation, but in Bio-CCS, the target is generation and production of methane out of depleted oil/gas reservoir during CO2 abatement. Our project aims to evaluate the basic practicability of Bio-CCS that cultivate methanogenic geo-microbes within depleted oil/gas reservoirs for geological CCS, and produce methane gas as fuel resources on the course of CO2 abatement for GHG control. To evaluate total feasibility of Bio-CCS concept, we have to estimate: CH4 generation volume, environmental impact along with life cycle of injection well, and risk-benefit balance of the Bio-CCS. We are modifying the model step by step to include interaction of oil/gas-CO2-geomicrobe within reservoir more practically and alternation of geo-microbes generation, so that we will be able to estimate methane generation rate more precisely. To evaluate impacts of accidental events around Bio-CCS reservoir, we estimated CO2 migration in relation with geological properties, condition of faults and pathways around well, using TOUGH2-CO2 simulator. All findings will be integrated in to it: cultivation condition of methanogenic geo-microbes, estimation method of methane generation quantities, environmental impacts of various risk scenarios, and benefit analysis of schematic site of Bio-CCS.",

            "abstract": "EarthScope’s geodetic component in Alaska, the UNAVCO-operated Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) network, includes 139 continuous GPS sites and 41 supporting telemetry relays. These are spread across a vast area, from northern AK to the Aleutians. Forty-five of these stations were installed or have been upgraded in cooperation with various partner agencies and currently provide data collection and transmission for more than one group. Leveraging existing infrastructure normally has multiple benefits, such as easier permitting requirements and costs savings through reduced overall construction and maintenance expenses.\nAt some sites, PBO-AK power and communications systems have additional capacity beyond that which is needed for reliable acquisition of GPS data. Where permits allow, such stations could serve as platforms for additional instrumentation or real-time observing needs. With the expansion of the Transportable Array (TA) into Alaska, there is increased interest to leverage existing EarthScope resources for station co-location and telemetry integration. Because of the complexity and difficulty of long-term O&M at PBO sites, however, actual integration of GPS and seismic equipment must be considered on a case-by-case basis.\nUNAVCO currently operates two integrated GPS/seismic stations in collaboration with the Alaska Earthquake Center, and three with the Alaska Volcano Observatory. By the end of 2014, PBO and TA plan to install another four integrated and/or co-located geodetic and seismic systems. While three of these are designed around existing PBO stations, one will be a completely new TA installation, providing PBO with an opportunity to expand geodetic data collection in Alaska within the limited operations and maintenance phase of the project.\nWe will present some of the design considerations, outcomes, and lessons learned from past and ongoing projects to integrate seismometers and other instrumentation at PBO-Alaska stations. Developing the PBO network as a platform for ongoing research and hazard monitoring equipment may also continue to serve the needs of the research community and the public beyond the sun-setting and completion of EarthScope science plan in 2018.",

            "abstract": "Recently, extreme weather occurrences associated with climate change are gradually increasing in frequency, causing unprecedented major weather-related disasters. General Circulation Models (GCMs) are the basic tool used for modelling climate. However, the discrepancy between the spatio-temporal scale at which the models deliver output and the scales that are generally required for applied studies has led to the development of various downscaling methods. Stochastic downscaling methods have been used extensively to generate long-term weather sequences from finite observed records. A primary objective of this study is to develop a forecasting scheme which is able to make use of a multimodel ensemble of different GCMs. This study employed a Nonstationary Hidden Markov Chain Model (NHMM) as a main tool for downscaling seasonal ensemble forecasts over 3 month period, providing daily forecasts. In particular, this study uses MMEs from the APEC Climate Center (APCC) as a predictor. Our results showed that the proposed downscaling scheme can provide the skillful forecasts as inputs for hydrologic modeling, which in turn may improve water resources management. An application to the Nakdong watershed in South Korea illustrates how the proposed approach can lead to potentially reliable information for water resources management.\nAcknowledgement: This research was supported by a grant (13SCIPA01) from Smart Civil Infrastructure Research Program funded by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT) of Korea government and the Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA).\nKeywords: Climate Change, GCM, Hidden Markov Chain Model, Multi-Model Ensemble",

            "abstract": "Sea level indicators from the last interglacial (LIG) suggest that sea level was higher than present day. Thus, present-day sea level is taken as the reference level when interpreting the LIG data. Models of the Earth's and ocean's response to the changing ice sheets are used to understand how the Earth's deformation and ocean redistribution introduces geographic variability into the data. These physical processes are collectively termed glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA).\nNeither the Earth nor the ocean are completely recovered from the loading of the last glacial cycle. For this reason, the GIA model results for present day are subtracted from the results at prior times in order to derive the relative sea-level histories that are compared to data. Thus, the unrelaxed GIA signal of the last glacial cycle is effectively propagated back in time in the model predictions. Any difference in this component of the GIA model will contribute to our uncertainty of model prediction during the LIG.\nIn this contribution, we examine this level of uncertainty that this unrelaxed component will introduce to the analysis of the data. Lack of knowledge of both the ice load history and Earth model will contribute to this uncertainty, and we additionally focus on the contribution of the ice sheet history from the LIG to the last glacial maximum (LGM), which is the least constrained. While the uncertainty contribution is not large, this is a necessary step in developing a more complete uncertainty budget.",

            "abstract": "We present measurements from the Cassini Radio and Plasma Wave Science/Langmuir probe (RPWS/LP) instrument of the electron density in the ionosphere of Titan from the first ~100 flybys (2004-2014). After more than 10 years of measurements a good number of measurements exists from Titan’s ionosphere. This allows for statistical studies of the structure of Titan’s ionosphere. The electron density has been shown to vary significantly from one flyby to the next, as well as on longer time scales and here we discern some of the reasons for the observed ionospheric variability. Firstly, following the rise to the recent solar maximum we show how the ionospheric peak density, normalized to a common solar zenith angle, Nnorm clearly varies with the ~11-year solar cycle. Nnorm correlates well with the solar energy flux Fe and we find that Nnorm ∝ Fek, with k = 0.54 ± 0.18, which is close to the theoretical value of 0.5. Secondly, we present results that indicate that the ionospheric density in the topside ionosphere (altitude range 1200-2400 km) are generally significantly increased, roughly by a factor of 2, when Titan is located in the post-midnight sector of Saturn, i.e. at Saturn local times 00 - 03 h, compared to other local time sectors. We suggest that this increase could be caused by additional particle impact ionization from reconnection events in the Saturn tail.",

We coupled surface to bottom oxygen and carbon stable isotopes, TEX86, and biotic records from biomarker and micropaleontological analysis to first document both MECO climate change and its effects in an open ocean, SE Atlantic setting. Benthic foraminiferal, coarse fraction and fine fraction accumulation rates were used as proxies for benthic, planktic foraminiferal and nannoplankton productivity, and the abundance of crenarchaeol, biomarker of widespread archaeal nitrifiers, to infer ammonia utilization rates. Our records show an uniform, surface-to-deep warming during MECO at mid southern latitudes. In parallel, benthic and planktic foraminiferal productivity decreased markedly, whereas rates of ammonia consumption increased, while primary productivity and water column stratification appear unchanged. We ascribe these biotic changes to MECO warming, due to the temperature-dependency of metabolic rates, particularly of heterotrophic respirators (e.g., O’Connor et al., 2009). Increased oceanic temperature would have altered pelagic food webs, increasing heterotrophs metabolic rates, thus food needs. Therefore planktic foraminiferal populations declined, and organic matter remineralization in the water-column, i.e., ammonia production, increased. The carbon flux to the sea-floor decreased, starving benthic foraminifera. A decrease in organic carbon export and burial, if widespread in oligotrophic open-ocean areas, would have been important to sustain pCO2rise during the early phase of MECO.\n",

            "abstract": "The Mekong Delta (Vietnam) is highly vulnerable to the many impacts of global environmental change as well as to the accelerating anthropogenic changes in the catchment and in the delta itself. Today the delta is an agricultural landscape controlled by engineering structures such as channels, dykes, embankments, and sluice gates. These structures have been constructed gradually over the last 200 years mainly for irrigation and flood control in the upper part of the delta and to control saline intrusion in the coastal areas. Recent changes in the hydrology mainly driven by upstream hydropower development on the mainstream and the tributaries of the Mekong will likely have far reaching impacts on the delta´s social-ecological systems through changes in e.g. sedimentation processes, nutrient transport as well as the health of aquatic ecosystems. Further threats to the delta include sea level rise and an increase in seasonal rainfall variability leading to an increase in flood variability. These changes affect the lives of millions of low-income inhabitants who depend on the ecosystem services provided by the Mekong for their livelihoods and sustenance. Since the changes in ecosystem service provision are occurring relatively fast while the resource dependency of the delta population is very high, adaptation becomes a challenge. An assessment of livelihood dependencies on ecosystem services requires an understanding of ecosystem services affected by different drivers of change, as well as of the types of livelihoods likely to be jeopardized as a result of these changes. We will present main ecosystem services supporting specific livelihoods, discuss how they are threatened, and analyse the merits of potential solutions. Options based solely on grey infrastructure might be problematic on the long term while an integration of ecosystem based solution such as a (re)adaptation of agricultural production systems to floods in the upper delta might be a more sustainable option. As the importance of policy interventions was demonstrated for the region, we argue that adaptation to climate change needs to be facilitated by policies embedded in a more flexible and adaptive agricultural development plan for the delta also considering no regret ecosystem based solutions with additional benefits for livelihoods.",

            "abstract": "Ozonolysis of alkenes is an important source of particulate matter (e.g., secondary organic aerosol) in the atmosphere. However, the mechanisms by which Criegee intermediates (CI) react to form the particles, particularly the oligomeric components, are currently not well understood. In this study, ozonolysis of trans-3-hexene was investigated with a focus on the formation mechanism of oligomers involving CI, as well as their contributions to particle formation and growth. Ozonolysis experiments were performed both in a static chamber and in a flow reactor in the absence and presence of an OH or stabilized CI (SCI) scavenger. The oligomeric and elemental composition of the total and size-selected particles was measured with different mass spectrometries, and the effects of adding OH and SCI scavengers were investigated. Size-selected measurements show that the relative abundance of higher ordered oligomers in the particles decreases with increasing particle size, indicating the preference of larger oligomers in the growth of smaller particles. Consistent with oligomeric composition, the O/C ratio of the particles decreases with particle size, suggesting more oxygenated organic material (e.g., primarily oligomeric peroxides) in smaller particles. The mechanism for particle formation suggested by these data is the initial reaction of RO2 radicals to the CI, followed by sequential addition of CI, in agreement with the earlier work of Sadezky et al. (2008). The relationship to the mechanism of particle formation from larger alkenes such as terpenes and the atmospheric implications will be explored.",

In December 2013, the Chinese Chang’e-3 (CE-3) spacecraft, carrying the Yutu (Jade Rabbit) rover, successfully landed on the northern Mare Imbrium, the Moon. The surface in-situ radar experiments by CE-3 mission provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the shallow subsurface geology of the Moon. While the processing and interpretation of radar observations usually depend on certain geophysical models and should consider regional geological settings. In this work, we quantified the subsurface structure at the CE-3 landing site using imaging data and illustrated a multi-layer subsurface structure model including three layers of regolith, two layers of basalt deposits and one layer of ejecta. Our result can provide essential references for CE-3 radar data processing and interpretation. The CE-3 radar observations can in turn validate previous technique for quantifying subsurface geology using imaging data, thus further deepening our understanding of lunar geoscience and exploration.",

These were transported from upper mantle to crustal depths underneath the Colorado Plateau by a kimberlitic diatreme (ca. 30 Ma) as xenocrysts and xenoliths. On the basis of major element chemistry, inclusion/lamella mineralogy, color, and host rocks of garnets, the Garnet Ridge garnets were classified into the following ten groups (Table) using 495 analyzed grains: A. Cr and pyrope-rich garnet, B. pyrope-rich reddish brown garnet, C. garnet aggregate, D. garnet megacryst, E. garnet in eclogite, F. garnet in metasomatized eclogite, G. quartz lamellae-bearing garnet, H. garnet in metasomatic rock I, I. garnet in metasomatic rock II, J. almandine-rich garnet.\nA and B are of mantle peridotite origins. Both garnets were characterized by Cr-Spl lamellae for A, and Cpx/Amp lamellae for B, respectively. B is subdivided into 2 types by lamellae and inclusions: (Prp 49-66, Grs 16-26 mol%) lamellae of Rt, Ilm, Cpx, Amp, and Chl, and (Prp 47-66, Grs 11-24 mol%) lamellae of Ilm and fluid inclusions.\nC and D have similar chemistry and inclusion/lamella mineralogy. The chemistry (Prp 22-53, Grs 11-41, Alm 26-50 mol%) and the wide variation suggest metasomatism at mantle depths.\nE includes Rt, Omp, Zrn, Ap, Kfs, and simplectite of Zo + Ab. F contains Rt, Omp, and Ap. Both E and F have chemical zonation from core to rim in Alm component. These garnets are of subducted oceanic slab origins, probably Fallaron plate.\nG includes Cpx, Zrn, and fluid, and oriented lamellae of Rt, Ap, and Qtz. Oriented Qtz lamellae characterize this group.\nThe host rock of H is of metasomatism origin at crustal depths. H has Grs-rich composition and inclusions of Mt, Zo, Ttn, Ap and fluid.\nI has lamellae of Rt and crichtonites, and includes Qtz and Zrn. The host rock of I was strongly altered.\nJ shows chemical zonation from core to rim in Alm component. This garnet includes Pl, Qtz, Ilm with Mt lamellae, and Rt lamella.\nThe close relations between the major element chemistry and inclusion/lamella mineralogy of the garnets from the Garnet Ridge are determined. Such results lead to constrain the origins of the garnets and their formation environments, such as metasomatism at crustal to mantle depths, past subductions, lithosphere and upwelling asthenosphere underneath the Colorado Plateau.",

            "abstract": "Fe oxides are very common in the earth’s crust and easily transform into other minerals such as magnetite and siderite under reducing conditions by microbial reactions. It is well known that As concentrations in groundwater is strongly regulated by adsorption onto Fe oxides. Even though some studies have suggested that the formation of siderite can also control the As concentration, direct evidences are not sufficient. In this study, we performed microbial incubation experiments to see the phase transition of As-rich Fe oxides under anoxic condition and to see how the water As concentrations are controlled accordingly. Three experiments were performed by changing organic carbon concentrations. Natural groundwaters and yeast extracts were used for the sources of microorganisms and organic carbon. Seven reactors were prepared for each experiment and opened one by one to observe the changes of the water chemistry and solid phases for 60 days. The formation of magnetite was observed at the early stage of each experiment. Siderite was formed at the later stage only when the dissolved organic carbon concentrations were high (donor/accepter molar ratio = 1.5). Goethite and hematite, instead of siderite, were formed from the experiment using low organic carbon concentration (donor/accepter molar ratio = 0.75). It is likely that dissolved ferrous ion adsorbs onto the Fe oxides and recrystallizes into hematite and goethite when the DOC concentration was low. As concentrations were generally very low in the water (normally 10 ug/L) and we could not find any relations with the Fe minerals formed by anoxic microbial reactions, maybe due to high Fe oxide/water ratio of our experiments. The sequential extraction analysis indicated that most of the As in solids are mostly associated with Fe-oxides and organic matters. The As bound to carbonates were very low even in the precipitates containing siderite due to low As concentrations in the water where the siderite formed. Further experiments precipitating siderite in the water with high As concentrations are required.",

Here we focus on on-ice atmospheric and oceanic ﬂows at the sea ice edge. Mesoscale jet formation due to the Coriolis effect is well understood over sharp changes in surface roughness such as coastlines. This sharp change in surface roughness is experienced by the atmosphere ﬂowing over, and ocean ﬂowing under, a compacted sea ice edge. We have studied a dynamic sea ice edge responding to atmospheric and oceanic jet formation. The shape and strength of atmospheric and oceanic jets during on-ice ﬂows is calculated from existing studies of the sea ice edge and prescribed to idealised models of the sea ice edge. An idealised analytical model of sea ice drift is developed and compared to a sea ice climate model (the CICE model) run on an idealised domain. The response of the CICE model to jet formation is tested at various resolutions.\nWe ﬁnd that the formation of atmospheric jets during on-ice winds at the sea ice edge increases the wind speed parallel to the sea ice edge and results in the formation of a sea ice edge jet. The modelled sea ice edge jet is in agreement with an observed jet although more observations are needed for validation. The increase in ice drift speed is dependent upon the angle between the ice edge and wind and can result in a 40% increase in ice transport along the sea ice edge. The possibility of oceanic jet formation during on-ice currents and the resultant effect upon the sea ice edge is less conclusive. Observations and climate model data of the polar oceans has been analysed to show areas of likely atmospheric jet formation, with the Fram Strait being of particular interest.",

In the extreme case, a large bend in the fault can stop the rupture. We develop a 2-D finite difference method to simulate spontaneous dynamic rupture on irregular faults. This method is based on a second order leap-frog finite difference scheme on a uniform mesh of triangles. A relaxation method is used to generate an irregular fault geometry-conforming mesh from the uniform mesh. Through this numerical coordinate mapping, the elastic wave equations are transformed and solved in a curvilinear coordinate system. Extensive numerical experiments using the linear slip-weakening law will be shown to demonstrate the effect of fault geometry on rupture properties.

            "abstract": "In this study we present the dependence of the global Poynting flux on the IMF By polarity change. The amount of energy that enters the magnetosphere from the solar wind is a function of the solar wind speed and pressure and the IMF orientation and magnitude. All the various published coupling models show that the polarity of the IMF By component does not change the energy input. In contrast the global convection patterns, and thus the ionospheric Pedersen currents, depend on IMF By polarity. This seems to imply that the ionospheric energy deposition is a function of IMF By polarity. Thus, there appear to be a fundamental difference between the input (from the solar wind) and the output (energy dissipating Pedersen currents). We, therefore, ask the question: To what extend is the global Poynting flux dependent on the IMF By polarity? We have performed a statistical study evaluating 59 abrupt transitions in the IMF By component (polarity changes) as measured by the ACE spacecraft. The effect of other solar wind coupling parameters, such as the IMF Bz component, are minimized by selecting events where these are nearly constant. We use electric field distributions from SuperDARN and field-aligned current distributions from AMPERE to calculate the global distribution of the Poynting Flux. To minimize the effect of magnetospheric energy unloading we focus on the 06-18 MLT region. We further investigate the dependence on solar induced conductivity. We find that the Poynting flux is slightly larger for positive IMF By compared to negative By conditions. For a low conductivity (not sunlit) ionosphere the Poynting flux is smaller than in the high conductivity (sunlit) ionosphere and we find a smaller dependence on IMF By polarity. The study emphasizes the global dynamic behavior of the ionosphere in its response to changes in the external driver (IMF).",

            "abstract": "Interpretation of proxy data is important to reconstruct the past climate, but it is sometimes over-simplified. By using data assimilation for proxy data, an objective analysis of the past can be achieved without simplifying the empirical relationship between proxy data and climate and environment information. As the first step for this challenge, we developed a new data assimilation system using a local transform ensemble Kalman filter (LETKF) and the Isotope-incorporated Global Spectral Model (IsoGSM) and an observation system simulation experiment (OSSE) was then conducted. The OSSE used a synthetic dataset of vapor isotope measurements, mimicking Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES)-retrieved δD from the mid-troposphere, SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY)-retrieved δD from the water vapor column, and the virtual Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP)-like surface vapor isotope (both δD and δ18O) monitoring network. For TES and SCIAMACHY, we assumed a similar spatiotemporal coverage as that of the real datasets. For the virtual GNIP-like network, we assumed ~200 sites worldwide and 6-hourly measurements. An OSSE with 20 ensemble members was then conducted for January 2006. The results showed a significant improvement in not only the vapor isotopic field but also meteorological fields, such as wind speed, temperature, surface pressure, and humidity, when compared with a test with no observations. For surface air temperature, the global root mean square error has dropped by 10%, with 40–60% of the decrease occurring in the east-southeast Asia where the concentration of observations is relatively higher. When there is a conventional radiosonde network, the improvement gained by adding isotopic measurements was small but positive for all variables. Although some limitations do exist, these results clearly show the potential of water vapor isotope measurements as a constraint on atmospheric dynamic processes to help improve our understanding of the hydrologic cycle.",

            "abstract": "Charon’s mass, orbital parameters, and distinct surface composition relative to Pluto suggest that it plays a significant role in Pluto’s dynamic interaction with the solar wind. Its high mass ( ~ 10% of total system mass ) and close orbit ( < 20 Pluto Radii ) are thought to result in regionally enhanced atmospheric escape from Pluto as well as ionospheric deformation. Additionally, there are multiple mechanisms through which Charon could possess a tenuous atmosphere—and therefore ionosphere. Firstly, spectral observations of short-lived hydrated ammonia on Charon’s surface could be caused by semi-regular cryovolcanism, which would also source a water group atmosphere (Cook et al., 2007). Secondly, recent work indicates that Charon could have a nightside parasitic atmosphere that is captured from material escaping from Pluto (Tucker et al., 2014). Either possibility would result in Charon presenting a sizable obstacle to the incoming solar wind. This work studies Charon’s effects on the Pluto-solar wind interaction using a 3-dimensional multifluid MHD model which has been modified to include a second body within the system. This second body (Charon) represents not only an additional gravitational perturbation to the system, but can also provide a local and distinct plasma source, a sink for plasma sourced from Pluto or the solar wind, and cause an obstruction and perturbation to the solar wind. Specifically, we investigate the possibility of enhanced ionospheric loss from Pluto due to Charon’s gravitational attraction, as well as the overall dynamics of a two-body system interacting with the solar wind in which each body has an ionosphere and periodically passes through the bow shock of the other body. The former objective is made possible by tracking the flux of plasma sourced from Pluto. The latter objective is accomplished by performing simulations in which Charon is upstream of Pluto as well as simulations in which Charon is placed downstream, within Pluto's wake.",

            "abstract": "Density and seismic wave velocity are fundamental properties of rocks that are often measured only through laboratory experiments. In northern Italy the major concern in crustal models is due to the presence of the Po Plain, a huge basin filled with a Plio-Quaternary sedimentary sequence whose thickness varies from few hundred meters to some kilometers, bounded by the northern Apennines and the Alps. In order to better characterize the first few kilometers of the crust in the Po Plain and surrounding regions we have used wireline borehole logs in 64 selected deep wells. We have analyzed all available stratigraphic profiles, geophysical logs and particularly 37 sonic logs. From these latter data we have characterized the P-wave velocity trend with depth and for each recognized lithology. Densities have been estimated following an empirical relationship between sonic velocity and density in sedimentary rocks: in the Po Plain the mean density value is 2.25 g/cm3, whereas the maximum density of the shallow crust in the Apennine is around 2.65 g/cm3. We have also calculated the vertical stress magnitude in each well: the Po Plain shows a maximum regional lithostatic gradient around 21 MPa/km while in the Apennines belt the values are around 26 MPa/km. Although in this area a 2D crustal velocity model does not adequately constrain the complicated and uneven tectonics, we have established a shallow crust model consisting of five layers. These direct data, together with other derived geological and geophysical information, can contribute to build a 3D model of the area.",

            "abstract": "The great Tohoku-oki earthquake (M9.0) occurred on 11th March, 2011 along the Japan Trench, off the Pacific coast of eastern Japan. The source region spreads over an area with a length of 500 km and a width of 200 km, almost all part of which is beneath the seafloor. We, the group of Japan Coast Guard (JCG), have continued repeated GPS-acoustic seafloor positioning after the Tohoku-oki earthquake at six seafloor sites in the offshore source region, the results of which are expected to provide information leading to better understandings of postseismic processes.\nIn contrast to the coastal GNSS sites where trenchward-upward movements were reported, the offshore sites above the main rupture zone in the northern part of the source region exhibit landward displacements of tens of centimeters with significant subsidence from more than three years of repeated observations. At the sites above around the edge of the main rupture zone, smaller amount of trench-normal movements were found. Although the terrestrial movements were reasonably interpreted by afterslip beneath the coastal area, these offshore results are rather consistent with effects predicted from viscoelastic relaxation in the upper mantle, providing definitive evidence of its occurrence. On the other hand, a site in the southern part of the source region with relatively small coseismic slips shows not only trenchward movements with logarithmical decay with time but also significant subsidence, which imply superposition of effects from viscoelastic relaxation and afterslip.\nIn this presentation, we report our latest observation results and discuss postseismic movements on the seafloor just above the source region for more than three years after the earthquake.",

            "abstract": "With 12 years of GRACE satellite data now available, the ice mass loss trend of Greenland are clearly demonstrating ice mass loss in marginal zones of the ice sheets, and increasing mass loss trends in some regions such as the north west marginal zones. Although the GRACE release-5 products have provided a significant increase in resolution, the detailed space-based detection of where the ice sheet is loosing mass needs to come from other sources, notably satellite altimetry from EnviSat, IceSat and CryoSat, which point out the detailed location of areas of change, and – when combined with firn compaction and density models – also can be used to infer mass changes. In the paper we outline results of a novel direct inversion method, where all satellite data can be utilized in a general inverse estimation scheme, and the leakage from neighbouring ice caps minimized. We demonstrate overall mass change results from Greenland and Eastern Canadian Ice Caps 2003-14, highlighting the increasing melt in the marginal zones both in NW and NE Greenland. Most of the used data used are provided by the ESA Ice Sheets CCI project 2012-14, which makes available long term Essential Climate Variables such as Surface Elevation Changes, Ice Velocity and Calving Front Locations for the Greenland ice sheet. In the upcoming 2nd phase of the CCI project, Gravimetric Mass Balance from GRACE will be included as a ECV time series, and a similar CCI project started for Antarctica.",

            "abstract": "Some of the fundamental tectonic problems of the Eastern Mediterranean remain unresolved due to the extremely thick sedimentary cover (~15 km) and the lack of accurate magnetic anomaly data. We conducted a magnetic survey of the Herodotus and Levant Basins (Eastern Mediterranean) to study the nature and age of the underlying igneous crust. The towed magnetometer array consisted of two Overhauser sensors recording the total magnetic field in a longitudinal gradiometer mode, and a marine vector magnetometer. Accurate navigation together with the gradiometer data allows the separation of the magnetic signature of the lithosphere from the contributions of the external magnetic field and the geomagnetic field. Total field data in the Herodotus Basin reveal a sequence of long-wavelength NE-SW lineated anomalies (~80 nT) suggesting a deep (~20 km) 2D magnetic source layer. Analysis of the vector data shows a steady azimuth of lineations that is generally consistent with the total field anomalies. The sequence of anomalies is rather short and does not allow a unique identification. However, the continuous northward motion of the African Plate during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic result in predictable anomaly skewness patterns for the different time periods. Forward magnetic modeling best fit the observed anomalies when using Early Permian remanence directions. Altogether, these observations and analysis suggest that a Neo-Tethyan Permian oceanic crust underlies the Herodotus Basin. Two short-wavelengths and strong (~400 nT) anomalies are found in the Levant Basin, proposing rather shallow (~7 km) magnetic sources there. These anomalies spatially coincide with Mesozoic uplifted continental structures (Eratosthenes and Jonah Highs).",

            "abstract": "Model calibration is frequently limited by the availability, quality, quantity and the nature of ground observations. Remotely sensed soil moisture and evapotranspiration (ET) provide an alternative source of hydrological information to inform models. In this study, microwave soil moisture retrievals from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E) and daily estimates of ET from CSIRO MODIS ReScaled potential ET (CMRSET) model are adopted to calibrate a land surface model using 15 different objective functions considering various combinations of bias and correlation of ET and soil moisture. The Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE) calibration algorithm is used to calibrate a grid-based land surface model modified from the Australian Water Resource Assessment - Landscape (AWRA-L) model. The study catchments are located in south Australia with ground observations of ET and soil moisture for validation. Parameters for calibration are selected based on the results from variance-based Sobols’ sensitivity analysis. The efficacy of each calibration is assessed mainly based on the streamflow predictability of the calibrated model.\nCalibration schemes with a greater emphasis on ET provide good estimates of ET but the streamflow predictions are comparatively poor. It is found that the streamflow predictions improve when higher importance is given to soil moisture derived objective functions. The optimized parameter values exhibit wide variations for different objective functions even though they provide similar values for streamflow, ET and soil moisture. Lastly, we discuss about the reasons for poor performance of the ET-based calibration and the impact of physical properties of the catchment on the calibration. This study has important implications to the optimal use of remotely sensed observations for hydrological modeling at large catchments with sparse or no gauging.",

            "abstract": "The wide geographical distribution of bivalve shells makes them much favoured paleoclimate proxy archives. However, they are amongst the materials most affected by physiological effects, making the correct deciphering of these archives a challenging task. Shell building plans are usually hierarchic, thus optimizing mechanical properties. However, different structures common to certain bivalve families, such as the prism-nacre or the crossed-lamellar structures, are assembled from very different building blocks. These structural differences coincide with chemical and crystallographic differences suggesting critically different formation mechanisms within the bivalve class. Most importantly some bivalves form their shells from amorphous calcium carbonate that crystallizes in situ once assembled into the shell. We present new correlated multi-scale structural and compositional data for different shell bivalve shell structures such as nacre-prism, cross-lamellar intermediate structures. Data are obtained using EBSD, FIB-assisted TEM and Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction combined with Nano-SIMS and Raman Microspectrometry and suggest that formation from amorphous phases is widespread and results in different calcium carbonate polymorphs to be present in the shell with distinct chemical compositions. The results highlight the complex nature of the biomaterials, which has consequences for the precision and accuracy of paleotemperature calculations.",

Rice is the most popular staple food for Asian people. In addition, the effects of climate change are getting stronger especially in Asian region, where the most of rice are cultivated. Therefore, accurate and timely prediction of rice yield is one of the most important to accomplish food security and to prepare natural disasters such as crop defoliation, drought, and pest infestation. In the present study, GOCI, which is world first Geostationary Ocean Color Image, was used for estimating temporal vegetation indices of the rice paddy by adopting atmospheric correction BRDF modeling. For the atmospheric correction with LUT method based on Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S), MODIS atmospheric products such as MOD04, MOD05, MOD07 from NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) were used. In order to correct the surface anisotropy effect, Ross-Thick Li-Sparse Reciprocal (RTLSR) BRDF model was performed at daily basis with 16day composite period. The estimated multi-temporal vegetation images was used for crop classification by using high resolution satellite images such as Rapideye, KOMPSAT-2 and KOMPSAT-3 to extract the proportional rice paddy area in corresponding a pixel of GOCI. In the case of GRAMI crop model, initial conditions are determined by performing every 2 weeks field works at Chonnam National University, Gwangju, Korea. The corrected GOCI vegetation products were incorporated with GRAMI model to predict rice yield estimation. The predicted rice yield was compared with field measurement of rice yield.",

            "abstract": "Reliable measurement of river discharge is important for management of water resource and understanding of hydrological cycles particularly associated with global and regional climate changes. Practically, to obtain continuous time series of river discharge, regression analysis of an empirical relationship between accumulated water level and discharge data is used. During wet season, however, the relationship includes more uncertainty due to the difficulty of accurate discharge measurement. This is particularly true for the Amazon River because significant amount of water flows outside river channel during flooding.\nFor an alternative way to estimate river discharge, we use GRACE time-varying gravity measurement from January 2003 to December 2012. We first apply Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) for GRACE time-varying gravity fields in Amazon and successfully isolate gravity signal in the main stream. The EOF time series represents relative river discharge variations without larger uncertainty during flooding season compared to conventional in-situ discharge estimate. Estimates of Amazon River discharge based on GRACE data are very close to those from observed at gauge stations during dry seasons. However, our estimates are larger than in-situ data in high water seasons, and the difference is the maximum at the 2009 flooding. This is probably because in-situ observation underestimates river discharge during wet season due possibly to detoured water in river pathway developed during flooding while GRACE observes integrated water mass variations in river channels.",

            "abstract": "The Martian region located immediately north of the dichotomy scarp, between latitudes 120°E and 135°E, is covered by fretted terrains, characterised by the presence of knobs and mesas formed by eroded and reworked material of highlands provenance, and the smoother terrains between them [1]. Topographic depressions of oblong shape, generally parallel to the scarp, of rough and chaotic appearance, are also observed. The high resolution (~ 6 m/pixel, [2]) Context Camera (CTX) on board Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) makes it possible to examine the morphologies of these topographic depressions in great detail, unveiling their complex geological histories. Here we expand on our earlier work in the adjacent Nepenthes Mensae region [3] and present the results of our observations of morphologies of likely igneous origin. We identified a variety of shapes consistent with magmatic structures and constructs: dikes, collapsed lava tubes, and lava flows are observable in the smoother terrains. Most of the elevated structures in the areas are strongly eroded knobs and mesas covered by dust and debris. In some cases however, the morphological characteristics of 2-10 km-size structures are clear and sharp, which allowed us to identify features consistent with sub-ice volcanic constructs, such as tuyas and tindars [4]. Geological reconstructions involving magma-ice interaction are supported by the presence of lobate aprons around knobs and mesas, and of scalloped ejecta surrounding complex impact craters, suggesting the existence of ice both underground and on the surface of these low elevation areas at the time of formation of these constructs.\n[1] Tanaka et al.

            "abstract": "The oblique subduction of the Pacific plate beneath the southernmost part of the Kuril trench is generating a unique tectonic environment in the Hokkaido Island, Japan. In this area, the Kuril forearc sliver started to collide against Northeast (NE) Japan arc from the east at the time of middle Miocene to form the Hidaka collision zone (HCZ). This collision has been acting as a responsible factor for the westward obduction of the crustal rocks of the Kuril arc (the Hidaka metamorphic belt (HMB)) along the Hidaka main thrust (HMT) and the development of the thick foreland fold-and-thrust belt.\nA multi-disciplinary project of the 1998-2000 Hokkaido Transect, crossing the northern part of the HCZ in EW direction, collected high-quality seismic data on a 227-km seismic refraction/wide-angle reflection profile and three seismic reflection lines. Reprocessing/reinterpretation for this data set revealed detailed collision structure ongoing in the northern part of the HCZ. The westward obduction of the Kuril arc crust was clearly imaged along the HMT. This obduction starts at a depth of 27-30 km, much deeper than in the southern HCZ (23-25 km). In the west of the HMT, we recognize the gently eastward dipping structure, representing the fragments of Cretaceous subduction/arc complexes or deformation interfaces branched from the HMT. The most important finding from our reprocessing is a series of reflection events at a 30-45 km depth below the obducted Kuril arc crust, which probably correspond to the lower crust/Moho within the NE Japan arc descending down to the east under the collision zone. The wide-angle reflection data indicate that the subducted NE Japan arc meets the Kuril arc 30-40 km east of the HMT at a depth of 30 km. This structural geometry well explained a weak but coherent seismic phase observed at far offsets (120-180 km) on the wide-angle reflection line.\nThe obtained structure shows the complicated collision style where the upper 30-km Kuril arc crust is thrust up with significant deformation. At the moment, we cannot find out the strong evidence of crustal delamination. This is in a marked contrast with the case of the southern part of the HCZ, where the upper 23-km crust is obducted at about 20 km distance from the HMT, while the remaining lower crust is descending down to the subducted Pacific plate.",

            "abstract": "The collision zone between the North China Block (NCB) and the South China Block (SCB) is one of the most important tectonic boundaries in the eastern part of China. There are several characteristics in this collision zone, including the exposure of high pressure and ultrahigh pressure metamorphic (HPM/UHPM) rocks. However, the detail structure under this collision zone is still uclear. In this work we try to obtain high resolution and reliable crustal and uppermost mantle structure in this collision zone. We process continuous ambient noise data collected from ~300 stations of Chinese provincial networks operating during 2010 and 2013 to extract inter-station surface wave dispersion curves. Then we generate Rayleigh wave group and phase velocity maps at 5-60 sec periods. In order to improve the precision of Moho depth and shear wave structure, we further collect teleseismic data to calculate receiver functions for all of the stations, and do a joint inversion with receiver function and surface wave dispersion curves to construct a 3D isotropic Vsv model. The 3D Vsv model reveals detailed crustal and uppermost mantle velocity structures which help to decipher the tectonic mechanisms of the SCB and NCB collision zone.\nTwo belts with thin Moho thickness are observed: one belt starts from south part of the Yangtze block and extends to Sulu Basin along the Tancheng-Lujiang Fault (TLF), the other one starts from the south part of Yangtze block and extends to the west part of the eastern North China Craton. There is a dramatic crustal thickness gradient along the North-South gravity Lineament (NSGL), which means that the NSGL is the consequence of the variation of crustal thickness. The shear wave velocity structure of the Qinling-Dabie orogen (QDO) is different from the surrounding NCB and SCB, there is a deep rooted high velocity anomaly in east end of the QDO this region, which may be the residuals of the exhumation of the UHPM rocks. The upper mantle velocity under the Subei Basin is much lower than that of Sulu Belt and the west side of TLF, which may be resulted from the thinning of the lithosphere in the east side of TLF, arguing for significant extension of the Subei Basin during the collision process of the NCB and the SCB blocks.",

            "abstract": "Detrital thermochronology of modern river sands from the Alaska Range quantifies the timing, extent, and magnitude of regional exhumation during Cenozoic subduction and translation along the southern Alaska margin. This detrital approach provides an effective way to quantify regional exhumation in remote areas like Alaska, where sampling bedrock and acquiring exhumation data for large areas requires tremendous effort. We present apatite and zircon fission track (FT) and zircon U/Pb ages from 13 catchments that span 450 km east to west along the Alaska Range. Zircon U/Pb ages indicate a dominant igneous first-cycle source that comprises >90% of most age distributions, even in areas where igneous outcrop comprises <10% of the catchment area. In addition, zircon FT age peaks are equivalent to zircon U/Pb age peaks in most cases, suggesting contemporaneous pluton cooling from 800°C through 240°C. On the other hand, apatite FT ages that record cooling through 110°C are younger and illuminate exhumation during mountain-building. We deconvolved detrital apatite FT age distributions into constituent age peaks. Overall, the young apatite FT age peaks are commonly 9-4 Ma and of high proportion in the central Alaska Range, as well as on the western and eastern ends of the range. In more detail, catchments draining both Mt. Foraker and the eastern Alaska Range have dominant 4 Ma age peaks in contrast to 9-6 Ma age peaks near Denali (Mt. McKinley) and in the western Alaska Range. These data suggest a large but discontinuous region of Late Miocene-Pliocene exhumation during growth of the Alaska Range, with exhumation influenced by local structures. In addition, most catchments display a 25-20 Ma peak that indicates regional exhumation concurrent with the onset of Yakutat flat slab subduction along the southern Alaska margin. Finally, some catchments display a 50-45 Ma peak that suggests localized exhumation during and after spreading ridge subduction along the southern Alaska margin. To estimate age-elevation relationships in each catchment, we employ recent Bayesian inverse modeling of cooling ages and hypsometries. We demonstrate the utility of this technique for the Ruth and Kahiltna catchments draining Denali, where new detrital data, as well as a previous bedrock vertical transect, both suggest a 7-6 Ma onset of rapid erosion.",

            "abstract": "Major parts of Greenland are covered with up to 3.4 km of ice. Due to logistical challenges connected to the ice only very sparse geophysical information is available. We present here results of the TopoGreenland project, which forms the first regional seismic experiment conducted on the Greenlandic ice shield. Our objective is to gain detailed information about the lithospheric structure and to connect it with topographic features, the recent substantial uplift and the earlier history of rifting and break-up in the region. We focus on a 200 km x 600 km large area in central-eastern Greenland, where 22 broadband seismometers were installed between June 2009 and May 2012. 10 of those were operating on the ice cap, 12 on bedrock. 16 of the stations were installed along a 600 km long profile at 70°N, from Scorsbysund to the centre of the ice cap. The remaining 6 stations covered a 200 km wide area north of this profile. In addition data from 6 permanent and long-term stations from the GLISN network were integrated. Here we present models from P- and S- receiver function (PRF, SRF) calculations and Rayleigh wave tomography. The RF calculations were used to map Moho and LAB depths and to have well constrained input parameters for the tomography. From the Rayleigh wave tomography we then obtain models for crustal shear-velocities. The PRF for the stations on the ice cap show multiples with very high amplitudes from within the ice, why we decided to derive Moho and LAB depths for those stations from SRF. The results will be compared with a seismic refraction profile acquired in the same region and then linked to topographic features like the uplift of the mountain chain in East Greenland.",

In the last couple of years sophisticated 3D simulation try to address the response of the induced magnetosphere and its escape to different time-dependent drivers. Modolo et al (2012) discussed about timescales required for the induced magnetosphere to recover from an IMF rotation. Ma et al (2013) used time-varying solar wind conditions (density and velocity enhancement) and concluded that the ionospheric/atmospheric system reach a new equilibrium in few hours. We use a 3D parallel multi-species hybrid simulation model to study the response of the induced magnetosphere to a time-varying solar wind dynamic pressure. The hybrid model (Modolo et al, 2014, in prep) includes crustal fields, a ionospheric chemistry scheme and uses a 3D description of the Martian thermosphere (Chaufray et al, 2014) and exosphere (Yagi et al, 2012). The impact of a solar wind dynamic pressure change on plasma boundaries is discussed. A special attention is focused on the time-varying energy deposition in the upper atmosphere by O+ ions precipitation as well as the escape flux of planetary ions.",

            "abstract": "The eastern tropical Pacific is an important climatic crossroad where the Intertropical Convergence Zone and the El Niño/Southern Oscillation drive seasonal and interannual changes in the regional rainfall patterns. Marine sediment cores indicate that the regional hydrological cycle experienced extreme changes during the last deglaciation, in close relationship with changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. There is, however, no consensus yet on the timing and geographical extent of those hydrological changes, as the timing of the recorded hydrological changes vary from site to site and depend on the proxy used. We present new hydrogen isotope measurements performed on C37:2 alkenones from a marine sedimentary sequence collected in the Panama Basin, off the Costa Rican margin. While an increase in δD of about 10 ‰ is recorded at the end of the Heinrich event 1, there is no significant change in δD during the Younger Dryas. A comparison of those data with seawater oxygen isotopic signatures estimated from the same core reveals differences in the way atmospheric circulation is captured by those two proxies. A comparison with alkenone hydrogen isotope measurements performed on a core located along the Columbian Margin demonstrates regional contrasts in the sensitivity of the hydrological cycle during te deglaciation. We will tentatively use jointly these results to build up a climatic scenario capable of explaining those contrasting modes of millenial-scale variability.",

In this study, we use simulations from CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) model archives to estimate changes in seasonal cycle of terrestrial soil water under global warming (with the RCP8.5 scenario). Our preliminary results show that future global warming is leading to declines in snow fall and snow amount in most models and a lack of snow melt during spring and summer results in less recharge of soil moisture, which makes soil water less during the dry season over most of the middle and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. In addition, decreases in the soil ice also play an important role in modifying the seasonal variations of soil water via affecting the infiltration and runoff rates, which might cause the soil dry out faster. The increase in annual cycle of the global soil water under global warming found in this study has important implications for water management and water security under climate changes due to an increase in the water distribution heterogeneity.",

In this region monitoring coastal evolution and the impact of sea storms is a primary administrative need, as a large part of the economic income derives from summer tourism.\nIn two years, we accumulated almost 200 hours of flight with two different UAVs, a professional-grade Mikrokopter Okto and a consumer-grade Phantom DJI. We used photogrammetric and orthorectification techniques to obtain Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and orthophotos of different beaches in the region.\nData from UAVs allowed us to answer several questions. What is the accuracy of DEMs obtained from UAVs in low-relief areas such as beaches? What are the problems encountered in the photogrammetric procedure near the shoreline? Are the results obtained with consumer-grade UAVs comparable to those obtained with professional-grade ones?\nAside from these technical questions, we used the data obtained from UAVs for different local studies aimed at giving management tools to the local administrations. We used the cloudpoint obtained from DEMs and the orthophotos to set up a runup modelling chain, to detect short-term changes in the coastal zone, and to give a first estimate of the debris deposited on the beach after a major storm.\nAs stated by Watts et al., 2012 (Remote Sensing 4, 1671-1692) the application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and photogrammetry techniques in earth sciences is flourishing, and has the potential to revolutionize the study of geomorphology. Surely, UAVs opened new research perspectives for our group, which has been actively working on coastal changes in Liguria for almost 25 years.",

            "abstract": "Mesoscale anticylonic eddies formed in the Alaskan Stream region south of the Aleutian Islands between the 180° meridian and about 170°E are called Aleutian eddies. Many of these eddies propagate in the southwestward direction, and often reach western subarctic gyre. The objective of present study is to compare hydrographic structures of three Aleutian eddies with distinctive propagation paths and evaluate potential impacts of physical environment along the paths on those eddies. We observed three eddies during the summers of 2010 and 2012, in which two of the eddies (A and C) were observed west of 172°E and one (B) east of 172°E. In each eddy, a subsurface cold dichothermal water (3.0-4.0°C) was observed to be located above a subsurface warm mesothermal water (4.0-4.5°C), and the two waters were separated by 26.5-26.6σθ isopycnals. The minimum temperature in the dichothermal water at ~26.4σθ was lower in the eddies A and C (2.8-2.9°C) than in the eddy B (3.2°C). This difference could be ascribed to eddy history of wintertime cooling and influence of warm Alaskan Stream. The Aleutian eddies were originated from the Alaskan Stream, and propagated westward after isolation from the Alaskan Stream. Winter cooling could make the dichothermal water cooler for eddies which were isolated for longer time. This is the case for the eddy A. The particle tracking experiments using the 1/10° eddy resolving ocean model called FRA-ROMS (Fisheries Research Agency of Japan) demonstrated that the water within the eddy was mostly originated from cold water around the propagation path in the early spring, suggesting continuous cooling of dichothermal water after the winter-time cooling. The eddy B stayed near the Alaskan Stream which could provide warm water to the eddy, to make less cold dichothermal water. The particle tacking experiments using FRA-ROMS confirmed that the water in the eddy was mainly originated from warm Alaskan Stream in the early spring, suggesting relative warming of dichothermal water. These are also confirmed from the climatological winter-mean temperature (WOA13) at 26.4σθ which was lower (< 3.0°C) around the propagation paths of eddies A and C which moved to the west of 171°E during winter than that of eddy B.",

            "abstract": "The mechanisms of lower crustal accretion remain a long-standing question for those who study fast-spreading mid-ocean ridges. One of the goals of Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 345 is to test accretionary models by investigating the structure of the lower oceanic crust exposed within the Hess Deep Rift. Located near the tip of the westward-propagating Cocos-Nazca spreading center, Hess Deep Rift exposes crust formed at the East Pacific Rise. During IODP Expedition 345, primitive gabbroic rocks were recovered from a dismembered lower crustal section at ~4850 meters below sealevel. Constraints on physical processes during magmatic accretion are provided by the relative orientation and strength of rock fabrics.\nWe present anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) fabric data from gabbros recovered from the two deepest holes (U1415J and U1415P). AMS measurements provide petrofabric data that may be used to constrain magma emplacement and subsequent magmatic flow. Bulk susceptibility ranges from 1.15 x 10-4 to 5.73 x 10-2 SI, with a majority of the samples having susceptibility greater than 10-3 SI, suggesting magnetite is the dominant contributor to the AMS signal. Low-temperature demagnetization data show Verwey transitions near 125K indicating the presence of nearly stoichiometric magnetite in most samples. AMS reveals dominantly oblate fabrics with a moderate degree of anisotropy (P’) ranging from 1.01 to 1.38 (average P’ = 1.13). Fabric strength varies within each of the petrologically-defined units recovered from different crustal blocks. Additional remanence anisotropy fabric analyses of a few specimens reveal nearly identical directions of principal axes compared to AMS, but with larger degrees of anisotropy. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) data from one sample shows a moderate plagioclase crystallographic preferred orientation best defined by a b-axis maxima that is coincident with the AMS minimum principal axis. This comparison between silicate and magnetic fabric data suggests that AMS is a good proxy for bulk silicate fabrics in these samples from Hess Deep. By integrating AMS and EBSD, both sensitive indicators of magnetic and silicate fabrics in gabbroic rocks, we seek a better understanding of the formation of gabbro in oceanic crust.",

            "abstract": "Infrasound is an efficient monitoring technique to remotely detect and characterize explosive sources such as volcanoes. Simulation methods incorporating realistic source and propagation effects have been developed to quantify the detection capability of any network. These methods can also be used to optimize the network configuration (number of stations, geographical location) in order to reduce the detection thresholds taking into account seasonal effects in infrasound propagation. Recent studies have shown that remote infrasound observations can provide useful information about the eruption chronology and the released acoustic energy. Comparisons with near-field recordings allow evaluating the potential of these observations to better constrain source parameters when other monitoring techniques (satellite, seismic, gas) are not available or cannot be made. Because of its regular activity, the well-instrumented Mount Etna is in Europe a unique natural repetitive source to test and optimize detection and simulation methods. The closest infrasound station part of the International Monitoring System is located in Tunisia (IS48). In summer, during the downwind season, it allows an unambiguous identification of signals associated with Etna eruptions. Under the European ARISE project (Atmospheric dynamics InfraStructure in Europe, FP7/2007-2013), experimental arrays have been installed in order to characterize infrasound propagation in different ranges of distance and direction. In addition, a small-aperture array, set up on the flank by the University of Firenze, has been operating since 2007. Such an experimental setting offers an opportunity to address the societal benefits that can be achieved through routine infrasound monitoring.",

            "abstract": "Due to Gibbs phase rule and combination of first and second law of thermodynamics, hydrate in nature cannot be in equilibrium since they come from different parent phases. In this system hydrate formation and dissociation is affected by local variables such as pressure, temperature and composition with mass and energy transport restrictions.\nAvailable simulators have attempted to model hydrate phase transition as an equilibrium reaction. Although those which treated the processes of formation and dissociation as kinetics used model of Kim and Bishnoi based on laboratory PVT experiment, and consequently hard to accept up scaling to real reservoirs condition. Additionally, they merely check equilibrium in terms of pressure and temperature projections and disregard thermodynamic requirements for equilibrium especially along axes of concentrations in phases.\nNon-equilibrium analysis of hydrate involves putting aside all the phase transitions which are not possible and use kinetic evaluation to measure phase transitions progress in each grid block for each time step. This procedure is Similar to geochemical reservoir simulators logic. As a result RetrasoCodeBright has been chosen as hydrate reservoir simulator and our work involves extension of this code. RetrasoCodeBright (RCB) is able to handle competing processes of formation and dissociation of hydrates as pseudo reactions at each node and each time step according to the temperature, pressure and concentration. Hydrates can therefore be implemented into the structure as pseudo minerals, with appropriate kinetic models.\nIn order to implement competing nature of phase transition kinetics of hydrate formation, we use classical nucleation theory based on Kvamme et al. as a simplified model inside RCB and use advanced theories to fit parameters for the model (PFT). Hydrate formation and dissociation can directly be observed through porosity changes in the specific areas of the porous media.\nIn this work which is in progress, we are going to inject CO2 gas inside the methane-hydrate reservoir and consider different competing reactions which might happen.",

Accordingly, many efforts have been put forward to quantify the seismicity and geological hazards in the region. However, the precise detective of earthquakes, especially for the minor ones, remains difficulty because of sparse distribution of permanent seismic stations. From December 2013 to June 2014, we deployed 30 three-component broadband seismic stations in the TGD region. During the deployment, we recorded two earthquakes of magnitudes lager than 5.0, one occurred on December 16th 2013 in Badong and another on March 30th 2014 in Zigui. We firstly used a sliding-window cross-correlation (SCC) detection technique to supplement the events catalog from the China Earthquake Networks Center. Over 500 new events with ML lager than 0.5 were detected. We then relocated 502 events out of the total 987 events using the double-difference (DD) relocation algorithm. We also determined moment tensors of some large earthquakes using gCAP. The results clearly show two active faults along Yangtze River with dips of 50 degrees and 90 degrees to a maximum depth of 10 km, respectively. And they also reveal that water might have permeated to a depth of 6 km corresponds to the interface of sediments and metamorphic basement beneath Zigui Basin. We thus preliminarily judge that the quakes are triggered by local stress adjustment resulting of fluctuation of Three Gorges reservoir’s loading.",

            "abstract": "The Ni content of olivine has been used extensively for inferring the source lithology, and depth and temperature of generation for basaltic magma in various tectonic settings. Conflicting interpretations have been derived using Ni because Hawaiian basalts show large variations in olivine Ni content (up to a factor of two) for a given forsterite (Fo). A detailed study of historical basalts at Kilauea volcano was undertaken using high-precision EPMA to better understand the cause of Ni variation in Hawaiian basalts. Experimental studies predict that Ni abundance in olivine should be positively correlated with Fo during growth. Element maps and core-rim transects of crystals strongly zoned in Fo show that many Kilauea olivines violate this relationship. They have decoupled profiles in which Fo decreases towards the rim by up to 5 mol% and Ni remains nearly constant. Here, we evaluate whether the Ni variability and Fo-Ni decoupling result from (1) diffusive re-equilibration and/or (2) sectioning effects rather than being primary growth features of those olivines. We used 1D diffusion modeling of Mg, Ni, and Ca from EPMA profiles to determine if decoupling is caused by diffusive re-equilibration. Calculated timescales (e.g. 2.2-3.1 yr) are in excellent agreement for all elements and transects within individual crystals, suggesting that the Fo-Ni decoupling is a primary growth feature of the olivine. Sectioning effects on Fo-Ni zoning were evaluated using 3D diffusion models of numerical olivines, which were constructed using realistic morphologies found in nature. Off-center and highly oblique sections have Fo and Ni extremums offset from the geometric center in 2D sections. Analyses of normally zoned olivine with decoupled Fo-Ni will yield similar Ni at variable Fo, introducing “Ni-enriched”, low Fo data. These “Ni-enriched” olivine compositions may contribute to the range of interpretations derived from current datasets",

            "abstract": "The study of streamflow diurnal cycles is of primary importance to understand hydrological processes happening at various spatial scales. In high altitude alpine catchments, streamflow diurnal cycles are typically dominated by snow or icemelt. During a field campaign in the summer 2012 in a small catchment in the Swiss Alps (Val Ferret catchment, draining area of 20.4 km2, mean altitude of 2423 m above sea level (asl), ranging from 1773 m to 3206 m asl, glaciarized area: 2%), we observed streamflow diurnal cycles throughout the season in two monitored sub-basins of the watershed. To study in detail the diurnal cycles, we make use of a wireless network of meteorological stations, time-lapse photography, a fully equipped energy-balance station and water electrical conductivity monitored at the gauging stations.\nIn the first sub-basin, we observed a transition from a snowmelt to an evapotranspiration induced diurnal streamflow cycle. In the second sub-basin, we observed a snowmelt/icemelt dominated diurnal cycle during the entire season due to the presence of a small glacier. Comparisons between icemelt and evapotranspiration cycles showed that the two processes were happening at the same times of day but with a different sign. The amplitude of the icemelt cycle decreased exponentially during the season and was larger than of the amplitude of the evapotranspiration cycle which was relatively constant during the season.\nA conceptual model was applied to estimate the effect of evapotranspiration on the diurnal streamflow cycle in the icemelt dominated sub-basin. The model makes use of the latent heat measured at the energy balance station, the streamflow loss due to evapotranspiration and the computation of active evapotranspiration areas. Our study suggests that evapotranspiration from the riparian area damps the icemelt-diurnal streamflow cycle resulting in a possible underestimation of glacier mass changes.",

When reconstructed within a lower mantle reference, the restored slab positions show a compelling fit opposite the pre-breakup (~185 Ma) southern margin of Gondwanaland from published plate reconstructions (Seton et al., 2012).\nHere we present a new plate reconstruction with the subducted slab constraints. At ~185 Ma the southern mapped slabs began to subduct under a SSE-moving Eastern Gondwanaland margin formed by Antarctica-Eastern Australia. The northern slabs were subducted during the formation of the new oceans at the Ellice Basin, Osbourn Trough and the present-day Tonga-Kermadec slabs. The mapped flat slabs were completely subducted by ~85 Ma, at which time subduction ceased at the Eastern Australian-Antarctica margin.\nWe mapped subducted slabs by manually picking the midpoints of fast seismic tomographic anomalies and constructing meshed mid-slab surfaces. Slabs were restored to their pre-subduction geometries by structurally unfolding to a spherical Earth model surface.

            "abstract": "The Lake of Monate is located in the Lombardia region, in Northern Italy, close to the highest peaks of the Alps. The lake surface is about 2.5 square kilometers, with a maximum and mean water depth of 34 and 18 meters, respectively. Intensive agricultural cultivation and mining activities took place in the surrounding area since ancient times, as well as intensive urban and industrial development in the recent past. Notwithstanding the above anthropic activity, and the urbanization along the lake banks, the Lake of Monate is still close to pristine conditions, therefore being a unique example of ecosystem in equilibrium. The human impact is negligble because the lake has no tributaries, being the water inflow supplied by groundwater fluxes only, providing an average inflow volume of about 3.18 million of cubic meters. Since Roman times intensive mining activities are taking place in a large area that is located outside the geographical contributing catchment to the lake. In fact, the two mining sites of Cava Faraona and Cava Santa Maria are placed beyond the geographical divide between the Lake of Monate and the contiguous Lake of Ternate. However, the presence of subsurface rock layers that are tilted towards the Lake of Monate makes the actual contributing catchment more extended, therefore including the mining sites. For this reason, the recent decision to intensify the mining activities induced relevant concerns for the possible impact on the ecological equilibrium of the lake. Therefore, the local administration promoted an intensive monitoring campaign finalized to reach a better understanding of the hydrology of the lake and the subsurface water fluxes, to quantify the actual impact of the mining works. Meteorological and hydrological data at several location and fine time scale are being collected from Fall 2013 therefore putting together an experimental data set of relevant scientific value. This contribution aims to present the meteorological, hydrological and ecological data base of the Lake of Monate to the scientific community and the first findings on the hydrology of the lake and the hydrological disturbance induced by the mining activities. The results show that particular care should be taken when estimating the human impact in catchments where groundwater flow is the main driver of hydrological fluxes.",

A number of different solar wind phenomena have been studied over the past forty years with the intention of understanding\nand forcasting solar behavior and space weather. In particular, Earth-bound interplanetary coronal mass ejections (CMEs) can significantly disturb the Earth’s magnetosphere for a short time and cause geomagnetic storms. We present a mission concept consisting of six spacecraft that are equally spaced in a heliocentric orbit at 0.72 AU. These spacecraft will monitor the plasma properties, the magnetic field’s orientation and magnitude, and the 3D-propagation trajectory of CMEs heading for Earth. The primary objective of this mission is to increase space weather forecasting time by means of a near real-time information service, that is based upon in-situ and remote measurements of the CME properties. The mission secondary objective is the improvement of scientific space weather models. In-situ measurements are performed using a Solar Wind Analyzer instrumentation package and flux gate magnetometers. For remote measurements, coronagraphs are employed. The proposed instruments originate from other space missions with the intention to reduce mission costs and to streamline the mission design process. Communication with the six identical spacecraft is realized via a deep space network consisting of six ground stations. This network provides an information service that is in uninterrupted contact with the spacecraft, allowing for continuos space weather monitoring. A dedicated data processing center will handle all the data, and forward the processed data to the SSA Space Weather Coordination Center. This organization will inform the general public through a space weather forecast. The data processing center will additionally archive the data for the scientific community. This concept mission allows for major advances in space weather forecasting and the scientific modeling of space weather.",

            "abstract": "The Lunar Penetrating Radar (LPR) carried by the Yutu rover of the Chinese Chang’E-3 mission has detected the shallow subsurface structures for the landing site at the northern Mare Imbrium. The antenna B of the LPR Channel-2 has collected more than 2000 traces of usable raw data. We performed calibration on the LPR data including amplitude compensation, filtering, and deconvolution. The processed results reveal that the shallow subsurface of the landing site can be divided into three major layers whose thicknesses are ~1, ~3, and 2-7 m, respectively. Variations occur on the thickness of each layer at different locations. Considering the geological background of the landing site, we interpret that the first layer is the regolith layer accumulated over ~80 Ma since the formation of the 450 m diameter Chang’E A crater. This regolith layer was formed on the basis of the ejecta deposits of Chang’E A. The second layer is the remnant continuous ejecta deposits from the Chang’E A crater, which is thicker closer to the crater rim and thinning outwardly. The Chang’E A crater formed on a paleo-regolith layer over the Eratosthenian basalts, which represents the third layer detected by the Channel 2B of the LPR.",

            "abstract": "The microdiamonds in the Kokchetav dolomite marble have been classified into S-, T- and R-type based on the morphologies, C isotope compositions, and other characteristics, and formed at two stages in the diamond stability field; the core of S-type and R-type at 1st stage and the rim of S-type and T-type at 2nd stage (Ishida et al., 2003; Yoshioka and Ogasawara, 2005; Imamura et al., 2013). Graphitic carbon inclusions were discovered in diamond grains in garnets in dolomite marble from the Kumdy-Kol area. We examined over 5000 diamonds in 40 thin sections and recognized 15 inclusions in 15 diamonds under transmitted light microscope. These host diamonds measure 4-15 µm. The inclusions are black-colored and measure 1-5 µm, and were found in the rim of S-type, T-type, and probably R-type. The inclusions were identified by laser Raman spectroscopy; one inclusion in the rim of S-type, four inclusions in T-type, and four inclusions in R-type. All examined inclusions are completely included in diamonds confirmed by 2D Raman mappings at different focal depths.\nAll Raman spectra of the inclusions show a peak at ca. 1580 cm-1 with FWHM of 15-23 cm-1. This peak is assigned to the G-band by sp2 bond of carbon. All intensity of G-band is <10 % of diamond-band at peak. Most of the peaks of G-band are located higher wavenumber. The peak positions with FWHM of G-band are (in the rim of S-type): 1579.7 cm-1 with 19.8 cm-1, (in T-type): 1581.5-1585.8 cm-1 with 15.6-22.2 cm-1, and (in R-type): 1580.3-1595.7 cm-1 with 15.0-17.2 cm-1. The variation of these peak positions may be caused by the internal (residual) pressure. Raman spectra of some inclusions in the rim of S-type, T-type, and R-type show peaks at ca. 1350 cm-1 (D1-band) and ca. 1620 cm-1 (D2-band), which are assigned to structure defect of sp2 bond.\nThe graphitic carbon inclusions discovered in the rim of S-type and T-type could be the relics of metastable intermediate graphitic carbon to form diamonds from aqueous fluids (see Akaishi et al., 2000; Yamaoka et al., 2000) in dolomite marble at 2nd stage. However, the graphitic carbon inclusions in R-type are still unclear; possible explanation is that the inclusions are the relics of graphite trapped in diamond grains when diamonds formed or the relics of metastable intermediate graphitic carbon for the R-type and the core of S-type formations at 1st stage.",

            "abstract": "The Alpine Fault, New Zealand, is a major plate-bounding fault that accommodates 65-75% of the total relative motion between the Australian and Pacific plates. The absence of measurable contemporary surface deformation has been interpreted to indicate that the fault slips mostly in quasi-periodic large earthquakes (< Mw 8.0). In order to understand the mechanics of earthquakes, it is important to study the evolution of frictional properties of the fault rocks under conditions representative of the potential hypocentral depth. Here, we present preliminary data obtained on drill core samples of rocks that surround the principal slip zone(s) (PSZ) of the Alpine Fault and the PSZ itself. The drill core samples were obtained during phase 1 of the Deep Fault Drilling Project (DFDP-1) in 2011 at relatively shallow depths (down to ~150 m). Simulated fault gouges were sheared under elevated pressure and temperature conditions in a hydrothermal ring shear apparatus. We performed experiments at temperatures of 25, 150, 300 and 450 °C. Using the shallow geothermal gradient of 63 °C/km determined in phase 1 of DFDP, our highest temperature corresponds to a depth of ~7 km or 10 km using a more moderate geotherm of 45 ºC/km as suggested by Toy et al. (2010). To explore temperature constraints on the limit of the brittle faulting processes, additional experiments at 600 ˚C (or ~10-15 km depth) are planned. Preliminary results on two hanging wall (foliated) cataclasite samples show a transition from velocity-strengthening behavior, i.e. a positive value of (a-b), to velocity-weakening behavior, i.e. a negative value of (a-b) at a temperature of 150 °C. The transition depends on the absolute value of sliding velocity, with velocity-weakening being more dominant at lower sliding velocities. Moreover, shear stress depends linearly on effective normal stress, indicating that shearing is essentially frictional and no transition to ductile (normal stress independent) flow has been observed. Thus, the AF should be able to generate earthquakes at temperatures up to 450 °C, which is consistent with the fact that microseismicity is recorded to depths of 8-12 km. We speculate that in our porous gouges, thermally activated processes operate simultaneously with granular flow, postponing ductile flow to higher temperatures or lower rates.",

            "abstract": "Diamond-bearing garnet-clinopyroxene rock (sample nos. 24997 and 25018) contains large-grained “microdiamonds” (ca. 150 µm at average) which are described as 2 types, cuboids and “ball-shaped” morphologies. Recently, we found another type of 2 grains; small-grained type (ca. 10 µm, rounded-shaped with smooth surface), completely included in garnet in the same rock with large-grained diamond. The Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy were conducted in order to characterize diamond in garnet-clinopyroxene rock among the various diamonds in the Kokchetav UHPM rocks.\n12 cuboids and 2 small-grained diamonds were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy using Ar+ laser (514.5 nm). The positions with the full widths at half maximum (FWHM) of Raman band of diamond are (cuboids): 1331.1-1332.1 cm-1 with 4.23-5.34 cm-1, and (small-grained): 1334.0-1334.7 cm-1 with 4.75-4.79 cm-1. The higher peak positions of small-grained type compared to cuboids were caused by internal (residual) pressure from the host garnet. 2D Raman mappings at different focal depths were also conducted to examine inside the diamond grains. At this moment, no specific variation and no inclusion have been detected in the diamond grains.\nPL spectra of 2 cuboids and 2 small-grained diamonds were measured using excitation lines of the Ar+ laser and the He-Ne laser (632.8 nm) to confirm PL band. All examined diamonds have a PL band at ca. 639 nm (NV- center) throughout grains. Using Ar+ laser, these 4 diamond grains (both cuboid and small-grained) showed strange PL bands at 554.5-557.5 nm (ca. 1450 cm-1), and their intensity distributions were strongly heterogeneous (sporadic within a diamond grain) within 1-3 µm scale. These PL bands have been already reported in other Kokchetav diamonds in dolomite marble and garnet-biotite gneiss.\nAlthough a wide variation of diamond-bearing rocks occur in the Kokchetav Massif and the formation environments of diamonds are quite diverse, in Raman spectra no critical difference was recognized up to now. Our studies just started and need to become broadened also to other diamond-bearings lithologies.",

Thus, it is effective for the analysis with complicated boundary such as free surface flow. On the other hand, since it is possible that particles varying their relative positions in MPS method, it courses a problem of non-uniformity in the spatial distribution of particles, thereby generating pressure fluctuation. Solving the pressure fluctuation problem has now been considered as the most important issue to improve the performance MPS method.\nSo far there are some ways been suggested to solve the problem, but the pressure fluctuation can not be erased fundamentally by any of those. To deal with the problem, Tamai, Koshizuka had proposed a higher-order accuracy differential model that can properly take into account the spatial arrangement of particles. However, this model has just been proposed 2013 and not been well verified when applied to simulation.\nThe present study has firstly comfirmed that compare to the old methods, Tamai, Koshizuka’s new model can solve the problem more effectively. Secondly, we try to use the new differential model to do the dam-break simulation which is a classical benchmark for free-surface issues. However, we found that the new model has problems when dealing with the Neumann boundary condition. So we proposed a new way of setting the Neumann boundary condition in order to use the new differential model correctly, and finially got a very good result in the simulation.",

            "abstract": "Interdependency between water and energy is generally transacted in trade-off mode; where either of the resource gets affected because of the other. Generally this trade-off is commonly known as water–energy nexus. Many studies have been undertaken in various parts of the world using various approaches to tease out the intricate nexus. This research has adopted a different approach to quantify the inter-dependency. The adopted approach made an attempt to tease out the nexus from demand side for both the resources. For water demand assessment PODIUM Sim model was used and for other parameters available secondary data was used. Using this approach percentage share of water for energy and energy for water was estimated. For an informed decision making and sustainable development, assessment was carried out at state level as most of the policies are made specifically for the state. The research was done for the southernmost state of India, Tamil Nadu which is a rapidly growing industrial hub. Tamil Nadu is energy and water intensive state and the analysis shows that the share of water demand from energy sector compared to water demand from other major sectors is miniscule. While, the energy demand in water sector for various processes in different sectors compared to energy demand as total has a comparable share of range 15-25%. This analysis indicated the relative risk sectors face in competition for the resource. It point outs that water sector faces fierce competition with other sectors for energy. Moreover, the results of the study has assessed that state has negative water balance, which may make access to water more energy intensive with time. But, a projection into future scenario with an assumption based on the ongoing policy program of improving irrigation efficiency was made. It provided a solution of a potential positive equilibrium which conserves both water and energy. This scenario gave promising results which indicated less of water demand from agricultural sector which is the most water intensive sector in the state, less requirement of energy for irrigation and improvement in overall water balance of the state.With the changing climate and growing population, resources at crisis can be managed sustainably if this nexus is decoded to understand the interdependency.",

So far we have acquired more than 120TB continuous seismic data form MeSO-net which consists of about 300 seismic stations.\nUsing MeSO-net data, we obtain clear P- and S- wave velocity tomograms (Nakagawa et al., 2010) and Qp, Qs tomograms (Panayotopoulos et al., 2014) which show a clear image of Philippine Sea Plate (PSP) and PAcific Plate (PAP). A depth to the top of PSP, 20 to 30 km beneath northern part of Tokyo bay, is about 10 km shallower than previous estimates based on the distribution of seismicity (Ishida, 1992). This shallower plate geometry changes estimations of strong ground motion for seismic hazards analysis within the Tokyo region.\nBased on elastic wave velocities of rocks and minerals, we interpreted the tomographic images as petrologic images. Tomographic images revealed the presence of two stepwise velocity increase of the top layer of the subducting PSP slab. Because strength of the serpentinized peridotite is not large enough for brittle fracture, if the area is smaller than previously estimated, a possible area of the large thrust fault on the upper surface of PSP can be larger than previously thought.\nChange of seismicity rate after the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake suggests change of stressing rate in greater Tokyo. Quantitative analysis of MeSO-net data shows significant increase of rate of earthquakes that have a fault orientation favorable to increasing Coulomb stress after the Tohoku-oki event.",

            "abstract": "Tropical forests are a crucial component of the global carbon cycle, and their responses to atmospheric changes may shift carbon cycling and climate systems. Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) are the major tools to simulate tropical forest responses to climate change. One of the main determinants of these simulated responses is the effect of CO2 on tropical tree physiology and growth, the 'CO2 fertilization effect'. The paucity of CO2 enrichment experiments in the tropics importantly limits insights into the CO2 fertilization effect as well as the validation of DGVMs. However, use can be made of the 40% rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration since the onset of the Industrial Revolution. The effects of the historical CO2 rise on tree physiology and growth can be obtained from stable isotopes, isotopomers and tree diameter increments obtained in tree-ring studies. We studied the physiological and growth responses of 12 tree species in Bolivia, Cameroon and Thailand to 150 years of CO2 enrichment.\nAnalyses of 13C of wood cellulose revealed strong, long-term increases in leaf intercellular CO2 concentrations for all study species and a marked improvement of intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE). For a subset of one species per site, we studied the Deuterium isotopomers (isomers with isotopic atoms) of glucose in wood to obtain a direct estimate of the photorespiration-to-photosynthesis ratio. We found that this ratio consistently and strongly decreased over the past century, thus increasing the effeciency and rate of photosynthesis. In spite of these strong physiological responses to increased CO2levels, we did not find evidence for increased tree diameter growth for any of the sites, or for sites combined. Possible reasons for the lack of a growth stimulation include increased (leaf) temperature, insufficient availability of nutrients or a shift in biomass investment in trees.\nOur results suggest that the strong CO2 fertilization of tropical tree growth often assumed in DGVMs does not hold and that these models may overestimate future biomass production in tropical forests. Empirical information on responses of tropical trees to historical CO2rise as presented here can be used to validate and possibly adapt (components of) DGVMs and improve the projections of tropical forest structure under climate change.",

            "abstract": "Since its identification as a 45 cm-thick basaltic ash horizon in a sediment core from Lake Saksunarvatn on Streymoy in the Faeroe archipelago the ~10 ka Saksunarvatn ash has been taken to represent one discrete stratigraphic marker horizon in early Holocene sedimentary sequences across the North Atlantic; from Greenland to Western Europe, carrying the inference that it was produced by one continuous eruption. If taken at face value, the volume of this basaltic tephra would be >450 km3, which not only makes it - by far - the largest tephra fall deposit produced by an explosive eruption at an Icelandic volcano but also puts it in the category of ‘super-eruptions’. It also implies that the inferred ‘Saksunarvatn eruption’ would have been about 40 times bigger than the ~3 ka H3 and ~4.2 ka H4 events, two of largest post-glacial silicic explosive eruptions in Iceland. Also, the largest known post-glacial basaltic explosive eruption in Iceland produced tephra volumes of 5-8 km3, or factor of 60 smaller than the anticipated ‘Saksunarvatn’ event. Although the geological record in Iceland contains ample examples of volcanic events with magnitudes in the range of VEI5-7, it does not reveal evidence of events on the super-eruption scale. These question the validity of the inference that the tephra referred to as the Saksunarvatn ash is a product of a single eruption. New studies on lake sediment cores and soil profiles in Iceland have identified several tephra layers in the time interval 10.4 – 9.9 ka that exhibit major element composition identical to that of the Saksunarvatn ash. Thus, over a period of ~500-years the Grímsvötn volcano produced a series of events erupting tephra of composition identical to that of the Saksunarvatn ash and we will present stratigraphic and geochemical evidence to demonstrate that the 10.4 – 9.9 ka interval of the early Holocene sediment archives contains at least six widespread tephra layers of Saksunarvatn composition and that an early Holocene tephra of such composition cannot be assumed to represent a unique correlative time marker horizon.",

However, the complex land surface reflectance have limited our understanding on canopy photosynthesis in urban parks. In this study, a 3-D canopy radiative transfer model, Forest Light Environment Simulator (FLiES), is coupled with a 1-D biophysical model, CANOAK, to investigate effect of floor reflectance on canopy-scale photosynthesis and evapotranspiration in an urban park, Seoul Forest Park (Seoul, the Republic of Korea). Through a series of intensive field works, we prepared model input data such as tree positions, crown shapes, leaf area index, photosynthetic parameters such as Vcmax and Jmax. Meteorological data were derived from flux tower observations.\nWe first evaluate the modelled net ecosystem exchange and latent heat flux against flux measurements from the eddy covariance system in the park. Then, we test the effects of floor reflectance on canopy photosynthesis and evapotranspiration using the model with different scenarios. Finally, we propose several design guidelines for urban park to increase carbon uptake by plants. The model simulation uncertainties are also discussed. We expect the usage of 3-D RTM would give better understanding of ecological processes in a complex space.",

            "abstract": "Melting phenomena have a crucial importance during the Earth’s formation and evolution. For example, a deep magma ocean of 1000 km or more has lead to the segregation of the core. Tomographic images of the Earth reveal ultra-low velocity zones at the core-mantle boundary that may be due to the presence of dense magmas or remnant zones of a deep basal magma ocean [1]. Unfortunately, measurements of amorphous silicate density over the entire pressure regime of the mantle are scarce and the density contrast between solid and liquid are difficult to assess due to the lack of such data. Only few studies have reported density measurements of amorphous silicates at high-pressure, with limitation up to 60 GPa. High-pressure acoustic velocity measurements have been used to calculate the density of MgSiO3 glass up to 30 GPa [2] but exhibit a large discrepancy compared to recent calculations [3]. SiO2 glass was measured up to 55 GPa using the X-ray absorption method through the diamond anvils [4] and very recently, X-ray diffraction has been used to infer the density of basaltic melt up to 60 GPa [5].\nHere we report density measurement of MgSiO3 glass up to 130 GPa and (MgFe)SiO3 glass up to 55 GPa using a novel variation of the X-ray absorption method. The sample contained in a beryllium gasket was irradiated with a micro-focus X-ray beam in two directions: perpendicular and parallel to the compression axis to obtain the absorption coefficient and density under pressure. Our data constrain the first experimental EoS for (Mg,Fe)SiO3 and the first EoS for MgSiO3 up to lowermost mantle pressures. Technical details and EoS parameters will be shown in the presentation. We will address the implications for melts in the deep Earth based on compressibility, bulk modulus and density contrasts between iron-free and iron-bearing glasses.\n[1] Labrosse S. et al.

            "abstract": "Arctic sea ice coverage is shrinking in response to global climate change, and summer ice-free conditions in the Arctic Ocean are predicted by the end of the century. The validity of this prediction could potentially be tested through the reconstruction of the climate of the Pliocene epoch (5.33-2.58 million years ago), an analogue of a future warmer Earth. Here, we show that, in the Eurasian sector of the Arctic Ocean, ice-free conditions prevailed in the early Pliocene until sea ice expanded from the central Arctic Ocean for the first time ca. 4 million years ago as a response to preglacial, tectonically induced circum Arctic uplift and enhanced freshening of the Arctic Ocean. A rise in topography above a critical threshold for ice accumulation, and final establishment of circum-Arctic oceanic gateways during the early Pliocene preconditioned the northern landmasses to become recipients for glacial ice during the late Pliocene. As a consequence, sea ice expanded progressively in response to positive ice-albedo feedback mechanisms, which were amplified further by the freshening of the Arctic as a consequence of the closure of the Central American Seaways. Sea ice reached its modern winter maximum extension for the first time during culmination of the Northern Hemisphere glaciation, ca. 2.6 million years ago.",

            "abstract": "Bedload transport in mountain streams is notoriously difficult to measure, and substantial efforts are currently devoted to develop and test reliable surrogate techniques for quantifying bedload transport rates and size. Tracers, and in particular Passive Integrated Transponders (PITs), represent a powerful method to assess particle dynamics. PITs are usually searched after floods using a portable antenna, and grain size of tracers are typically related to the peak of the events. However, antennas fixed on the channel bed have the potential to identify the actual discharge at the time of transport.\nThis work focuses on incipient motion of tracers measured with a stationary antenna in the upper part of a mountain basin (Saldur River, drainage area 18.6 km2, Italian Alps), where a glacier (2.3 km2) determines significant daily discharge fluctuations in summer. During the study period (2011 to 2013) flow discharge ranged from 1 to 10 m3s-1. Almost 600 clasts - ranging in diameter from 40 mm to about 0.5 m - were equipped with PITs and laid in a confined reach (6% slope) of the main channel featuring a bed morphology transitional from plane-bed to step-pool. PITs-clasts were gently placed on the bed surface few meters upstream of an antenna fixed on the channel bed, where flow stage is recorded every 10 min.\nPreliminary results indicate that discharge at the time of passage above the antenna is only slightly related to the size of transported tracers, providing little evidence of size-selectivity conditions in this stream. The influence of antecedent flows on incipient motion was then investigated dividing the maximum discharge recorded between each PIT placement and its subsequent entrainment by the actual critical discharge at the time of movement (ratio Qmax/Qc). It results that only 45% of tracers moved at Qmax/Qc ~ 1, and 70% of tracers moved at Qmax/Qc < 1.5. Therefore, about 30% of tracers had to previously experience a discharge substantially higher than the one which actually mobilized them. Interestingly, coarser particles moved at higher Qmax/Qc ratios. These preliminary results shed some light on the importance of antecedent flows on incipient motion of coarse particles in a mountain stream, revealing that the magnitude of previous flows seems quite relevant for their entrainment.",

            "abstract": "Seafloor heat flow measurements provide fundamental geophysical information that can be used to better understand tectonic processes. Regional heat flow patterns have been successfully used to study the cooling of the oceanic lithosphere, exhumation of deep crustal materials, strength of the faults, and other geological processes. However, sometimes there are variations of heat flows within a small area, making the interpretation of the heat flows difficult. Here we study the geological processes that can cause such variations. Over the last two decades, we have collected many dense 2D and 3D seismic reflection data offshore SW Taiwan and there is a wide-spread bottom-simulating reflector (BSR) found in the seismic profiles. The BSR is interpreted as associated with the base of the gas hydrate stability zone, and can be used to infer the temperature fields at shallow oceanic crust using a hydrate phase diagram. Such a dense and wide-spread dataset provides an unprecedented opportunity to study processes that can affect temperature fields in scales less than a kilometer. Here we show evidence of bathymetry-induced temperature perturbations at shallow oceanic crust by comparing the BSR-based temperature data with the temperature derived from steady-state 3D finite element modeling. We have also documented focused fluid flow migration along faults and fissures based on elevated temperature fields near those geological features. We also found seismic evidence of abnormal high heat flows caused by rapid erosion. Our results demonstrate that sometimes it is necessary to correct those effects before the heat flow data can be used for regional studies. Our study is among the first to provide observational data to study small-scale geological processes affecting seafloor temperature fields. Such information might also be important for gas and oil reservoir studies.",

            "abstract": "Realistic models of sea ice processes and properties are needed to assess sea ice thickness, extent and concentration and, when run within GCMs, provide prediction of climate change. The deformation of sea ice is a key control on the Arctic Ocean dynamics. But the deformation of sea ice is dependent not only on the rate of the processes involved but also the state of the sea ice and particular in terms of its evolution with time and temperature. Shear deformation is a dominant mechanism from the scale of basin-scale shear lineaments, through floe-floe interaction to block sliding in ice ridges. The shear deformation will not only depend on the speed of movement of ice surfaces but also the degree that the surfaces have bonded during thermal consolidation and compaction. Frictional resistance to sliding can vary by more than two orders of magnitude depending on the state of the interface. But this in turn is dependent upon both imposed conditions and sea ice properties such as size distribution of interfacial broken ice, angularity, porosity, salinity, etc. We review experimental results in sea ice mechanics from mid-scale experiments, conducted in the Hamburg model ship ice tank, simulating sea ice floe motion and interaction and compare these with laboratory experiments on ice friction done in direct shear from which a rate and state constitutive relation for shear deformation is derived. Finally we apply this to field measurement of sea ice friction made during experiments in the Barents Sea to assess the other environmental factors, the state terms, that need to be modelled in order to up-scale to Arctic Ocean-scale dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Probability density functions and related cumulative distributions are widely used to describe magnitude and frequency of river flows at-a-station. They constitute important tools in hydrological and engineering applications for their ability to quantify in a condensed fashion the overall flow availability and variability, and properly describe the underlying hydrologic regime. The river flow regime is a pivotal driver of natural and industrial processes occurring in riverine environments, like e.g. riparian vegetation dynamics and hydropower production. Nonetheless, some processes are strongly influenced by specific ranges of streamflows, namely high flows, whose features are described in the right-tail of the probability distribution. For this reason, an accurate description of high flow frequencies represents an important task to study fluvial processes such as sediment transport and floods.\nRecently, a physically-based stochastic model of streamflow dynamics has been developed and applied to a variety of catchments. The model provides an analytical expression for the streamflow distribution, which proved able to reproduce the frequencies of observed discharges and characterize in a meaningful way river flow regimes. This work focuses on the model capability to reproduce observed patterns in the tail of the flow distribution. In particular, a new method for the estimate of flow recession rates (based on analysis of single recessions) proved more effective in representing the cumulative distribution function, especially for high flows. At the same time, the model proves able to capture the emergence of heavy tailed distributions with divergent moments. The correlation between the peak flows and recession features, particularly accentuated in some cases, is extremely important for a correct representation of the tail of the streamflow distribution.\nThe results constitute a basis for a physically-based study of hydrologic and sediment transport regimes, and poses the basis for a mechanistic description of flood-frequency curves.",

This giant earthquake had caused great human and financial loss. After main shock, the Wenchuan earthquake Fault Scientific Drilling project (WFSD) was co-organized by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Land and Resources and China Bureau of Seismology, and this project focused on earthquake fault mechanics, earthquake slip process, fault physical and chemical characteristics, mechanical behavior, fluid behavior, fracture energy, and so on. In this study, the fault-rocks in the two trenches close to the two Wenchuan Earthquake surface rupture zone were used to discuss the earthquake slip dynamics, including the Bajiaomiao and Jiulong trenches along the Y-B F. and G-A F. earthquake surface rupture zones, respectively. This study also combined with the recent fault-rock magnetism from the earth surface and WFSD-1. The rock magnetism, from the Bajiaomiao trench and other previous researches, shows that the high susceptibility of the fault gouge along the Yingxiu-Beichuan earthquake fault zone was caused by the new-formed ferrimagnetic minerals, such as magnetite and hematite, so the Y-B F. had experienced high temperature and rapid speed thermal pressurization earthquake slip mechanism. The rock magnetism from the Jiulong trench implied that the slightly low average susceptibility of fault gouge was caused by high content of Fe-sulfides than that of fault breccia and Jurassic sandstones, which was possibly induced by earthquake process or earth surface process after the fault rocks exposed to the surface. If the high content of Fe-sulfides was induced by earthquake process, the G-A F. had experienced the low temperature and slow speed machanical lubrication earthquake slip mechanism. The different earthquake slip mechanism was possibly controlled by the deep structure of the two earthquake faults, such as the fault occurrence. The steep dip character of the Y-B F. could be easy to induce high temperature and rapid speed earthquake slip mechanism, while the low dip angle feature of the G-A F. could be easy to induce low temperature and slow speed earthquake slip mechanism.",

            "abstract": "Gravity currents flowing over porous media occur in many environmental processes and industrial applications, such as irrigation, benthic boundary layers, and oil spills. The coupling of the flow over the porous surface and the infiltration of the fluid in the porous media is complex and difficult to model. Of particular interest is the prediction of the position of the runoff front and the depth of the infiltration front.\nWe present here a model for the flow of a finite volume of a highly viscous Newtonian fluid over a dry, homogenous porous medium. The Navier-Stokes equations describing the runoff flow are coupled to the Volume Averaged Navier-Stokes equations for the infiltration flow. The numerical solution of these equations is challenging because of the presence of two free surfaces (runoff and infiltration waves), the lack of fixed boundary conditions at the runoff front, and the difficulties in defining appropriate conditions at the surface of the porous medium.\nThe first two challenges were addressed by using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics, which is a Lagrangian, mesh-free particle method particularly suitable for modelling free surface flows. Two different approaches were used to model the flow conditions at the surface of the porous medium. The Two Domain Approach (TDA) assumes that runoff and infiltration flows occur in two separate homogenous domains; here, we assume the continuity of velocity and stresses at the interface of the two domains. The One Domain Approach (ODA) models runoff and infiltration flows as occurring through a medium whose hydraulic properties vary continuously in space. The transition from the hydraulic properties of the atmosphere and the porous medium occur in a layer near the surface of the porous medium. Expressions listed in literature were used to compute the thickness of this transition layer and the spatial variation of porosity and permeability within it.\nOur results showed that ODA led to slower velocities of the runoff front and enhanced infiltration when compared to the implemented formulation of TDA. In the ODA, depending on the description of the transition layer, the maximum distances travelled by the runoff front and the maximum depth of infiltration varied over a range of ±15% and ±50% when compared to their respective averaged values.",

Continuous operation of this instrument can result in the determination of cloud occurrence and cloud base heights for the paired system. In this study, a fabricated paired sky imaging system – consisting two commercial digital cameras (Canon Powershot A2300) enclosed in weatherproof containers - is developed in Manila Observatory for the purpose of determining cloud base heights at the Manila Observatory area. One of the cameras is placed on the rooftop of Manila Observatory and the other is placed on the rooftop of the university dormitory, 489m from the first camera. The cameras are programmed to simultaneously gather pictures every 5 min. Continuous operation of these cameras were implemented since the end of May of 2014 but data collection started end of October 2013. The data were processed following the algorithm proposed by Kassianov et al (2005). The processing involves the calculation of the merit function that determines the area of overlap of the two pictures. When two pictures are overlapped, the minimum of the merit function corresponds to the pixel column positions where the pictures have the best overlap. In this study, pictures of overcast sky prove to be difficult to process for cloud base height and were excluded from processing. The figure below shows the initial results of the hourly average of cloud base heights from data collected from November 2013 to July 2014. Measured cloud base heights ranged from 250m to 1.5km. These are the heights of cumulus and nimbus clouds that are dominant in this part of the world. Cloud base heights are low in the early hours of the day indicating low convection process during these times. However, the increase in the convection process in the atmosphere can be deduced from higher cloud base heights in the afternoon. The decrease of cloud base heights after 15:00 follows the trend of decreasing solar energy in the atmosphere after this time. The results show the potential of these instruments to determine cloud base heights on prolonged time intervals. The continuous operation of these instruments is implemented to gather seasonal variation of cloud base heights in this part of the world and to add to the much-needed dataset for future climate studies in Manila Observatory.",

As the underlying processes responsible for triggering and sustaining warm extremes are extremely variegate and yet not well understood, the occurrence of extreme events such heat waves and prolonged droughts results exceedingly difficult to predict and model. Major uncertainties arise from the fact that warm extremes mainly derive from the interplay of large-scale atmospheric processes and local feedbacks operating across very different spatial and temporal scales, and are characterized by several thresholds, limiting factors and non-linearities determining their deviation from the “classical” extreme-value theory.\nIn this study we explore – from a global point of view – the role of local and synoptic dynamical components in initiating warm extremes and in determining their spatial and temporal clustering. Previous studies have already highlighted the role of large negative soil moisture anomalies in causing and sustaining long periods of dry and hot weather. For this reason we propose here a novel approach to the characterization of warm extremes, based on the conditioning of traditional air temperature quintile statistics to antecedent soil moisture conditions.\nCase studies from different climatic regimes are shown in order to prove the major and varied role of antecedent soil moisture conditions across the different regions of the world. In addition, we also investigate the connection between regional climate features and large-scale dynamics during warm extremes by the joint usage of classical diagnostic analysis and novel statistics for the detection of cross-scale interactions.",

            "abstract": "Auroral complex shapes are formed through the connection of the ionosphere and magnetosphere by the geomagnetic field lines, projecting disturbances in the magnetosphere onto the ionosphere through auroral particles. Thus, the study of auroral dynamics is important for the understanding of magnetospheric disturbances. Shiokawa et al. [JGR, 2010] reported observations of small-scale finger-like auroral structures which appeared on the west side of auroral patches, at Gillam (GLAT=65.5°N), Canada, suggesting a pressure-driven plasma instability in the magnetosphere. However, statistical characteristics of this phenomenon have not been investigated yet. Using an all-sky imager at Tromsoe (MLAT=67.1°N), Norway, from January 2009 to November 2012, we made a statistical analysis of the occurrence conditions of 19 events of auroral structures that seemed to be caused by pressure-driven instability. We found 14 large-scale finger-like structures, developed from auroral arcs, and 6 small-scale finger-like structures which appeared in auroral patches. The large-scale structures were seen from midnight to dawn MLT and small-scale structures were seen mainly at dawn. Large and small-scale structures tend to appear at the beginning and late recovery phase of substorms, respectively. Their scale sizes are larger than the gyro-radius of the ions in the magnetospheric equatorial plane, indicating that the finger-like structures are caused by MHD instabilities. However, the size of the small-scale structures is roughly two times that of the gyro-radius of the ions, suggesting that the ion finite Larmor radius effects may play a role in the shape of small-scale structures [Hiraki and Sakaguchi, 2010]. Additionally, the eastward propagation speeds of the finger-like structures are slower than the typical midnight auroral drift speed, indicating that the low-energy plasma may be the source of these structures. These results could contradict the idea that the high-energy particles lead to a pressure-driven instability.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake stress drops are often estimated from far-field body-wave spectra using measurements of seismic moment, corner frequency, and a specific theoretical model of rupture behavior. Perhaps, the most widely-used model is from Madariaga (1976), who performed finite-difference calculations for a singular crack radially expanding at a constant speed and showed that\nfc=kβ/a\n, where\nfc\nis spherically averaged corner frequency,\nβ\nis the shear-wave speed,\na\nis the radius of the circular source, and\nk\n= 0.32 and 0.21 for P and S waves, respectively, assuming the rupture speed\nVr\n= 0.9\nβ\n. Since stress in the Madariaga model is singular at the rupture front, the finite mesh size and smoothing procedures may have affected the resulting corner frequencies. Here we investigate the behavior of source spectra derived from dynamic models of radially expanding rupture with a cohesive zone that prevents a stress singularity at the rupture front. We find that in the small-scale yielding limit where the cohesive-zone size becomes much smaller than the source dimension, P- and S-wave corner frequencies of far-field body-wave spectra are systematically larger than those predicted by Madariaga (1976). In particular, the model with rupture speed\nVr\n= 0.9\nβ\nshows that\nk\n= 0.38 for P waves and\nk\n= 0.26 for S waves, which are 19 and 24 percent larger, respectively, than those of Madariaga (1976). Thus for these ruptures, the application of the Madariaga model overestimates stress drops by a factor of 1.7. We further address the validity of a standard assumption on a symmetrical circular source applied to real earthquakes. Our results suggest that up to a factor of two differences in the spherical average of corner frequencies are expected simply from the variability in source geometry and rupture styles, translating into a factor of eight differences in estimated stress drops. In addition, the large dependence of corner frequency on take-off angle relative to the source suggests that measurements from a small number of seismic stations are unlikely to produce unbiased estimates of spherically averaged corner frequency.",

With the advantage of a wide angular separation between the two STEREOs and the near-Earth Advanced Composition Explorer, we present the first report of multiple 3He-rich solar energetic particle (SEP) outbursts occurring in single active regions for relatively long time periods, lasting at least a quarter of a solar rotation. We identified several long-lasting 3He- or Fe-rich SEP sources with particle emissions successively observed at least on two of STEREO-B, ACE and STEREO-A spacecraft. Previous single spacecraft observations showed such energetic ion bursts over a limited time interval (about one day) presumably due to the loss of magnetic connection to the flare sites. These new observations reveal that the physical processes responsible for particle acceleration and escape from the Sun appear to be more continuous than previously thought. We discuss conditions in the solar sources which could lead to the reappearance of 3He-rich SEPs by comparing with the cases showing no such feature.",

The averaged instantaneous OPEs estimated via the ship-plume photochemical/dynamic modeling for the ITCT 2K2 ship-plume ranged between 4.61 and 18.92, showing that the values vary with the extent of chemical evolution (or chemical stage) of the ship plume and the stability classes of the marine boundary layer (MBL).

The values of the equivalent OPEs varied between 9.73 (for the stable MBL) and 12.73 (for the moderately stable MBL), which agreed well with the equivalent OPEs of 12.85 estimated based on the ITCT 2K2 ship-plume observations. It was also found that both the model-simulated and observation-based equivalent OPEs inside the ship-plume were 0.29-0.38 times smaller than the equivalent OPEs calculated/measured outside the ITCT 2K2 ship-plume.

            "abstract": "Carbonatite volcanism generally occurs in intra-plate settings associated with continental rifting. The only active carbonatitic volcano is the Oldoinyo Lengai, Tanzania, which generates sodium-rich carbonatites in close association with phonolites and nephelinites1. The processes of carbonatite genesis are still unresolved, however carbonate-bearing melts evidently play a crucial role during mantle melting, in diamond formation and as metasomatic agents. Carbonate melts show extraordinary properties, especially in regard to their low melt viscosities and densities, high surface tensions and electrical conductivities as well as distinct geochemical affinities to a wide range of trace elements2. Understanding the structural properties of carbonate-bearing melts is fundamental to explaining their chemical and physical behaviour as well as modeling processes operating in the deep Earth. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy is a versatile tool for element specific investigation of the short to medium range structure of melts and glasses. This study focuses on unraveling the influence of carbonate concentration on the structural incorporation of the geochemically important trace elements Y and Sr in silicate and carbonate melts in the system Na2O-CaO-Al2O3-SiO2-CO2. First, we present structural data of silicate glasses with up to 10 wt% CO2, quenched from melts under high temperature and pressure, which indicate that the local structure of Y and Sr is not or only slightly affected by CO2. Melts with higher CO2 contents could not be quenched to glass, so far. Second, we show results of high pressure, high temperature experiments conducted in the Paris Edinburgh-Press, which provides in-situ insight into carbonate-silicate melts. All EXAFS measurements were performed at the synchrotron facility beamlines SAMBA (SOLEIL) and BM23 (ESRF). Information derived from the trace elements’ local structure is used to develop a structural model for carbonate-silicate melts. The ultimate goal is to gain insight into the structural control on chemical fractionation processes in carbonate-bearing magmatic systems in the deep Earth.\n1.

            "abstract": "The European Alps display a complex record of subduction (Western Alps) and collision (Central Alps). Many of the tectonic units consist of mostly continental crust. Such polycyclic rocks are notoriously difficult to decipher, and countless efforts to analyze and quantify samples of Alpine basement have produced confusing data and controversial interpretations. As a result, the Alps have occasionally been portrayed as a pathological orogen…\nRecent progress in petrochronology yields robust in situ mineral ages that can be linked to physical conditions, i.e. quantitative PT-data for samples with a well established record of polyphase deformation. As the structural context is well known, integration of PTDt-data from mm-scale to km-tectonic units is possible.\nIn the Western Alps, the analysis allows an assessment of dynamics in the continental subduction channel. Major kinematic differences emerge between adjacent slices of km-size; rates of the main orogenic processes are now known. The major diachronicity in the high-pressure imprint (e.g. Sesia: 84-63 Ma) reflects kinematic differences near the subduction interface, during subduction and (generally fast) exhumation – but with pressure cycling of at least one tectonic slice.\nThe regional metamorphic imprint in the Central Alps is diachronous as well, but the causes are entirely different. High-pressure rocks are confined to two spatially separated units (a lithospheric mélange unit + an accretionary wedge); these are interleaved with several basement thrust sheets. The entire nappe stack experienced a medium pressure imprint. Petrochronology yields heating and cooling rates, and again the structural context is well enough established to understand the reasons of age differences at peak conditions (Tmax reached at 32-19 Ma in different parts of the belt).\nOverall, the reassessment of the orogenic timetable and processes helps to correct or reconcile many of the supposedly “abnormal” properties of the Alps. Unusual complexities mostly reflect that much detail is known in this chain, not least owing to the geophysically well established structure. Is it time to turn this around and examine in detail how seismic signatures reflect the characteristics (e.g. spatial density contrast) beneath now well understood parts of a “normal” orogen?",

            "abstract": "Many cases of pronounced amplification evident in strong ground motion recordings have been reported at sites with specific topographic features in last four decades. Although attempts have been made to explain such observations with the effect of the terrain geometry, the strong levels of observed amplification remain unexplained most of the time. However, the recent growth of seismic monitoring networks with appropriate site characterization allows for more systematic studies. We present results obtained for a number of elevated sites in Switzerland and Japan. A detailed site characterization, including measured S-wave velocity profiles down to 30-200 m, is available for these sites, as well as empirical amplification functions relative to a derived reference rock profile. On the one hand, we have not identified any general link between the geometrical features of the surface topography and the observed site response. On the other hand, the subsurface structure presents seismic velocity gradients even at outcropping rock sites. The studied rock sites (Vs30 > 800 m/s), on average, do not exhibit any systematic amplification, while the rest of the sites (Vs30 < 800 m/s) present frequency dependent amplifications with respect to reference rock condition. The observed amplification seems to be controlled in first place by the subsurface velocity structure. Finally, detailed 3D numerical modeling of seismic response was performed for a number of these sites. The joint effects of the terrain geometry and available velocity gradients are investigated. The synthetic amplification functions are compared with the empirical ones, and limits of the adopted models are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Arctic permafrost soils store 1700 Pg carbon (C), almost half the global soil C. For millennia permafrost soil C has been protected from decomposition by cold, waterlogged conditions. Warming temperatures will likely thaw permafrost, however the impact on arctic C balance is uncertain. Nutrient availability is predicted to increase with thaw depth and promote plant growth, potentially creating an ecosystem C sink. However, deeper thaw could also increase microbial respiration and eventually exceed C gains.\nUsing data from a warming experiment in sub-arctic moist acidic tundra, designed to insulate soils in winter and stimulate permafrost degradation, we investigated spatial and temporal drivers of ecosystem C balance. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) was measured continuously from May-September 2009-2013 using clear automated chambers; ecosystem respiration (Reco) was extrapolated from low light NEE and gross primary productivity (GPP) was derived (GPP = NEE-Reco).\nFive years of warming led to progressive increases in active layer depth. Active layer depth was positively correlated with cumulative growing season NEE, GPP and Reco. Although warming increased Reco the ecosystem remained a C sink during the growing season because high Reco was offset by increased plant growth and GPP. Eriophorum vaginatum growth accounted for most of the increased plant biomass, and was correlated with cumulative growing season GPP and Reco. NEE, GPP and Reco all peaked mid-season, and the mid-season amplitudes increased annually leading to higher cumulative NEE, GPP and Reco. In the shoulder seasons NEE and GPP were similar among years. In contrast, Reco increased at the end of the growing season each year, and high mid-season GPP was positively correlated with end season Reco. Thus, conditions that promoted plant growth also promoted C loss.\nThese results suggest plant responses to permafrost thaw are an important driver of C dynamics. Reco associated with high biomass may result from greater autotrophic respiration as well as enhanced microbial soil decomposition. Focusing only on the growing season may overestimate the C sink of the ecosystem because high uptake appears to enhance C losses at the end of the growing season, and C loss is likely to extend beyond the observation period.",

These observations provide data about water vapor column densities along the line of sight of the UVIS instrument. Monte Carlo simulations and Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) are used to model the plume of Enceladus including an option to add multiple jet sources to the general background plume. The models account for molecular collisions, gravitational and Coriolis forces. Jet sources can differ in production rate and velocity distribution of the water molecules emitted. Recent observations of the visible dust plume by the Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) identified as many as 98 jet sources located along Tiger stripes [Porco et al. 2014]. We applied the spatial distribution of the sources observed by ISS in our models. The output of the models are the 3-D distribution of water vapor density and surface deposition patterns.

The main goals of the project are to determine porosity-permeability values of the potential reservoir formation as well as to evaluate the integrity of the seal formation. During the Summer of 2014 a magnetotelluric (MT) survey was carried out at the Clare basin (Ireland). A total of 140 sites were acquired including audiomagnetotelluric (AMT), broadband magnetotelluric (BBMT) and long period magnetotelluric (LMT) data. The nominal space between sites is 0.6 km for AMT sites, 1.2 km for BBMT sites and 8 km for LMT sites. To evaluate the potential for carbon sequestration of the Clare basin three advances on geophysical methodology related to electromagnetic techniques were applied. First of all, processing of the MT data was improved following the recently published ELICIT methodology. Secondly, during the inversion process, the electrical resistivity distribution of the subsurface was constrained combining three different tensor relationships: Impedances (Z), induction arrows (TIP) and multi-site horizontal magnetic transfer-functions (HMT). Results from synthetic models were used to evaluate the sensitivity and properties of each tensor relationship. Finally, a computer code was developed, which employs a stabilized least squares approach to estimate the cementation exponent in the generalized Archie law formulated by Glover (2010). This allows relating MT-derived electrical resistivity models to porosity distributions. The final aim of this procedure is to generalize the porosity – permeability values measured in the boreholes to regional scales. This methodology will contribute to the evaluation of possible sequestration targets in the study area.",

A thick (~250 m) section of Burns formation layered hydrated sulfates is present on the rim and walls of Iazu crater. Comparisons to fresh Martian craters of the same size show that ~100 m of rim material has been removed by erosion. Iazu clearly formed during or after the emplacement of the Burns formation and thus preserves perhaps the best full Burns formation stratigraphic section. The Burns formation deposits stratigraphically and unconformably overlie the Noachian crust, which exhibits evidence of smectites. Within the underlying Noachian crust several layers of altered basaltic crust can be seen that are overlain by hydrated sulfates. The stratigraphic and mineralogic patterns show that the rocks exposed on the rim and walls of Iazu document the shift from formation of smectites to hydrated sulfates, beginning with several minor episodes and ending with a thick section of hydrated sulfates (i.e., the Burns formation). These rocks thus document the shift from aqueous alteration under relatively mild to extremely acidic and oxidizing conditions.",

For a direct comparison between the two columns, the averaging kernels (AKs) retrieved from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) algorithm were applied to the CMAQ model simulations. When the two NO2 columns before and after the applications of AKs were compared over East Asia, it was found that, for example, the normalized mean errors (NMEs) between the CMAQ-estimated and OMI-retrieved NO2 columns were reduced significantly, from ~103% to ~46%, from ~112% to ~45%, and from ~135% to ~40% during spring, fall, and winter, respectively. Also, the two tropospheric NO2 columns were better correlated spatially in East Asia (correlation coefficients = 0.71-0.94) after the application of the AKs. From this study, it was found that the NOx emission used were possibly underestimated in East Asia, although some overestimates were also found, partly over southern Central East China, the Sichuan Basin, and South Korea regions during the winter. However, these results can also be influenced by several uncertainty factors in the CMAQ model simulations, such as monthly variation and the strengths of the NOx emissions. Thus, we also applied another monthly variation and different strengths of the NOx emissions to the CMAQ model simulations over East Asia. The results showed strong impacts on the tropospheric NO2 columns in East Asia, indicating that these two factors are also important. In this study, further sensitivity analysis was conducted with reaction probabilities of N2O5 onto atmospheric aerosols.",

The idea that ventilation is localized is somewhat at odds with the more traditional picture of water mass formation as a broad circumpolar process. In this work, we aim to (i.) identify the primary mode and intermediate water export pathways out of the Southern Ocean and (ii.) to better understand the factors that control the location and intensity of these pathways. We examine the three-dimensional structure of the mode and intermediate water export routes on decadal to centennial timescales using both passive tracers and Lagrangian floats in an eddy-permitting Southern Ocean model. We find windows of strong mode water export in the Indian and Pacific sectors of the Southern Ocean and identify two potential tracks along which anthropogenic carbon dioxide and other tracers may be subducted. Our results suggest that the Pacific export pathway is especially intense, i.e. a large proportion of mode waters from both the Indian and Pacific sectors of the Southern Ocean enter subtropical latitudes via the Pacific pathway.\n",

To better understand the dynamics of bedrock groundwater, we investigated groundwater table movement and water chemistry of bedrock groundwater using dense borehole wells at a small catchment in a mountainous area.\nThe study was performed at the Fudoji Experimental Watershed located in the Tanakami Mountains in the southeastern part of central Japan. Precipitation was monitored and discharges were observed at eight small catchments, ranging in area from 0.1 to 2.3 ha. Seven small catchments (subcatchments) were included in the largest catchment (2.3 ha), within which we installed 61 borehole wells. Rainwater, streamwater from the small catchments and bedrock groundwater from the borehole wells were sampled, and the concentrations of major ions, SiO2 and the water stable-isotope ratios (d18O and dD) were measured.\nThe results indicated that there were several fluctuating characteristics and that these characteristics of groundwater table change had locality. At the area having higher altitude in the ridge, the bedrock groundwater-table changes were gradual but the ranges of fluctuation were larger than those of the lower wells. At the lower-altitude points, although the bedrock groundwater table responded rapidly, the ranges of fluctuation of the groundwater table were small relative to those of the higher points. Based on the groundwater flux analysis, bedrock groundwater moves across the surface divide. A catchment inflowed by a neighboring catchment showed a high specific discharge.\nThe results of chemistries indicated that although the weathering processes were similar in the catchment, the weathering level varied among the borehole wells. The chemistries of bedrock groundwater at each catchment and of streamwater at each catchment showed large variability. The concentrations of Na+ and Ca2+ had local characteristics, but no clear characteristics were observed among other bedrock groundwater components. The chemical concentrations of bedrock groundwater were higher than those of streamwater. These results indicate that complex processes of chemical dynamics occur in the weathered bedrock and from the weathered bedrock to the stream.\n ",

            "abstract": "The April 2012 Mw 8.6 Wharton Basin earthquake, followed by a magnitude 8.2 aftershock, is the largest ever instrumentally recorded strike-slip earthquake. The large magnitude event culminated a sustained strike-slip seismic activity in the diffuse boundary between the Indian and Australian plates and it reactivated some fracture zones of the Wharton Basin, previously simple structural discontinuities, into active faults. Previous studies (Delescluse et al., 2012; Wiseman and Burgmann et al., 2012) have shown the importance of the static Coulomb stress change due to the 2004 Mw 9.2 Aceh-Andaman and the 2005 Mw 8.6 Nias earthquakes in the triggering of the 2012 main shock. However, the mechanism responsible for the 7-year delay remains unclear. Here, we investigate the role of viscoelastic relaxation in the oceanic asthenosphere and aseismic slip on the N-S oriented reactivated fracture zones in the Wharton basin to explain the triggering mechanism. The deformation in the oceanic plate transitions from localized frictional sliding in the lithosphere to more distributed flow in the asthenosphere. There, the time-dependent deformation following large stress perturbations may induce significant stress changes at larger distances than coseismically. Similarly, if some fracture zones in the Wharton Basin have been reactivated into active faults, they may serve as efficient stress guides between the Sunda megathrust and the epicentral area of the 2012 event. To test these hypotheses, we use Relax (Barbot & Fialko, 2010), a numerical method that can evaluate coseismic and postseismic stress evolution using a realistic representation of the Sumatra subduction zone geometry and the Wharton Basin fracture zones, and rheological parameters inferred from laboratory experiments. Using typical parameters for power-law flow (Brace & Kohlstedt, 1980) and rate-strengthening friction (Marone et al, 1991), we infer the changes in confining pressure, shear stress and Coulomb stress near the 2012 Wharton Basin hypocenter as a function of time since the 2004 and 2005 megathrust earthquakes. Our study highlights the importance of time-dependent mechanisms of stress transfer in the triggering of large earthquakes at regional distance.",

            "abstract": "On 2011 July 10th, an earthquake of Mw 7.0 occurred in the shallow part of the Pacific slab beneath the large coseismic slip area of the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake. This event has a strike-slip focal mechanism with steep dipping nodal planes. Near the epicenter, aftershocks determined by OBS deployment formed clear two orthogonal lineaments with identical strikes of the focal mechanism solution, suggesting that the aftershock activity occurred along the two conjugate faults. The strikes of these faults were almost parallel to the direction of the magnetic lineations and the fracture zones of the incoming Pacific plate, suggesting that the earthquake was the re-rupture of congenital fractures under the extensional stress induced by the Tohoku-Oki earthquake. It is of great interest to know the down-dip size of the source fault not only to understand the mechanical nature of the slab but also the post-2011 stress state. Coseismic seafloor deformation and tsunami associated with the earthquake were observed by ocean bottom pressure gauges deployed within ~ 100 km from the epicenter. We estimated the finite fault model of this event to discuss the rupture properties of the earthquake. We sought the source model assuming a rectangular fault with a uniform slip assuming the strike of the fault to be one of those of two nodal planes of the focal mechanism. The two preferable source models corresponding to the two nodal planes explained the observed data equally well. For either model, the depth of the downdip end exceeds 40 km below the plate boundary, meaning the fault widths (down-dip size) were much larger than the depth extent of the aftershock distribution (~ 15 km). We sought another source model assuming the simultaneous rupture of the conjugate faults and found that the width of the fault model was more consistent with the aftershock distribution than the single rupture plane models. The 2011 intraslab strike-slip earthquake might be a compound rupture of the spreading-related fracture and the transform fault like fracture within the subducting Pacific slab.",

            "abstract": "We have developed a new type of ground-based lidar, Multi-Field of view-Multiple-Scattering-Polarization Lidar (MFMSPL), to analyze multiple scattering contribution due to low-level clouds. One issue of the ground based lidar is the limitation of optical thickness of about 3 due to the strong attenuation in the lidar signals so that only the cloud bottom part can be observed. In order to overcome the problem, we have proposed the MFMSPL that has been designed to observe similar degree of multiple scattering contribution expected from space-borne lidar CALIOP on CALIPSO satellite. The system consists of eight detectors; four telescopes for parallel channels and four for perpendicular channels. The four pairs of telescope have been mounted with four different off-beam angles, ranging from -5 to 35mrad, where the angle is defined as the one between the direction of laser beam and the direction of telescope. Consequently, similar large foot print (100m) as CALIOP can be achieved in the MFMSPL observations when the altitude of clouds is located at about 1km. The use of multi-field of views enables to measure depolarization ratio from optically thick clouds. The outer receivers attached with larger angles generally detect backscattered signals from clouds located at upper altitudes due to the enhanced multiple scattering compared with the inner receiver that detects signals only from cloud bottom portions. Therefore the information of cloud microphysics from optically thicker regions is expected by the MFMSPL observations compared with the conventional lidar with small FOV. The MFMSPL have been continuously operated in Tsukuba, Japan since June 2014.Initial analyses have indicated expected performances from the theoretical estimation by backward Monte-Carlo simulations. The depolarization ratio from deeper part of the clouds detected by the receiver with large off-beam angle showed much larger values than those from the one with small angle. The calibration procedures and summary of initial observations will be presented. The observed data obtained by the MFMSPL will be used to develop and evaluate the retrieval algorithms for cloud microphysics applied to the CALIOP data.",

            "abstract": "Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS) efficiently prevents the release of anthropogenic CO2 into the atmosphere. We investigate a potential site in the Polish Sector of the Baltic Sea (B3 field site), consisting in a depleted oil and gas reservoir. An area ca. 30 x 8 km was surveyed along 138 acoustic transects, realised from R/V St. Barbara in 2012 and combining multibeam echosounder, sidescan sonar and sub-bottom profiler. Preparation of CCS sites requires accurate knowledge of the subsurface structure of the seafloor, in particular deposit compactness. Gas leaks in the water column were monitored, along with the structure of upper sediment layers. Our analyses show the shallow sub-seabed is layered, and quantified the spatial distribution of gas diffusion chimneys and seabed effusion craters. Remote detection of gas-containing surface sediments can be rather complex if bubbles are not emitted directly into the overlying water and thus detectable acoustically. The heterogeneity of gassy sediments makes conventional bottom sampling methods inefficient. Therefore, we propose a new approach to identification, mapping, and monitoring of potentially gassy surface sediments, based on wavelet analysis of echo signal envelopes of a chirp sub-bottom profiler (EdgeTech SB-0512). Each echo envelope was subjected to wavelet transformation, whose coefficients were used to calculate wavelet energies. The set of echo envelope parameters was input to fuzzy logic and c-means algorithms. The resulting classification highlights seafloor areas with different subsurface morphological features, which can indicate gassy sediments. This work has been conducted under EC FP7-CP-IP project No. 265847: Sub-seabed CO2 Storage: Impact on Marine Ecosystems (ECO2).",

            "abstract": "The Izu-Bonin-Mariana volcanic arc system is an excellent example of an intraoceanic convergent margin where the effects of crustal anatexis and assimilation are considered to be minimal. The Izu fore arc is a repository of ashes erupted in the Izu-Bonin frontal arc because the prevailing wind blows from west to east. IODP Site U1436 (proposed Site IBM-4GT), located at 32°23.88’N, 140°21.93’E, lies in the western part of the Izu fore arc basin, ~60 km east of the arc-front volcano Aogashima, ~170 km west of the axis of the Izu-Bonin Trench, 1.5 km west of ODP Site 792, and at 1776 mbsl. It was drilled in April-May 2014, during IODP Expedition 350, as a 150 m deep geotechnical test hole for potential future deep drilling at proposed Site IBM-4 using the D/V Chikyu. The stratigraphic record of Late Pleistocene mafic and silicic explosive volcanic products from the arc front consists of tuffaceous mud interstratified with mafic and evolved ash and lapilli, including distinctive black glassy mafic ash layers. These distinctive intervals are basaltic andesite and the most mafic deposits analyzed shipboard at Site U1436. The facies appeared to be unusually homogeneous in componentry and texture\n; the overwhelmingly glassy nature of the ash suggests subaqueous explosive eruption, and its good sorting\nsuggests deposition by vertical settling through the water column from an ash plume that reached the atmosphere. An alterative hypothesis is that the ash layers have been redeposited in bathymetric lows by submarine density currents. These black glassy mafic ash layers attracted a great deal of interest among the science party because, if the first hypothesis is correct, they could record large-volume mafic explosive eruptions. As a result three more holes were drilled at Site U1436, in order to recover undisturbed examples of these layers. Samples from each hole are currently undergoing post-cruise geochemical (major, traces and volatiles) and componentry analysis to test these two hypotheses in more detail.",

            "abstract": "Recent years have seen renewed interest in the ocean tide as a source of energy for electrical power generation. Unlike in the 1960s, when the tidal barrage was the predominant method of power extraction considered and implemented, the current methodology favors operation of a free-stream turbine or an array of them in strong tidal currents. As tidal power generation moves from pilot-scale projects to actual array implementations, numerical modeling of tidal currents is expected to play an increasing role in site selection, resource assessment, array design, and environmental impact assessment. In this presentation, a simple, coupled ocean/estuary model designed for research into fundamental aspects of tidal power generation is described. The model consists of a Pacific Ocean-size rectangular basin and a connected fjord-like embayment with dimensions similar to that of Puget Sound, Washington, one of the potential power generation sites in the United States. The model is forced by an idealized lunar tide-generating potential. The study focuses on the energetics of a tidal system including tidal power extraction at both global and regional scales. The hyperbolic nature of the governing shallow water equations means consequence of tidal power extraction cannot be limited to the local waters, but is global in extent. Modeling power extraction with a regional model with standard boundary conditions introduces uncertainties of 3 ~ 25% in the power extraction estimate depending on the level of extraction. Power extraction in the model has a well-defined maximum (~800 MW in a standard case) that is in agreement with previous theoretical studies. Natural energy dissipation and tidal power extraction strongly interact; for a turbine array of a given capacity, the higher the level of natural dissipation the lower the power the array can extract. Conversely, power extraction leads to a decrease in the level of natural dissipation (Figure) as well as the tidal range and the current speed. In the standard case considered, at the maximum power extraction the tidal range in the estuary is reduced by 37% and the natural dissipation by 78% from the unperturbed state. Thus, environmental consequences of power generation are likely to become the limiting factor on the scale of resource development before the physical maximum is reached.",

            "abstract": "Sorting of sedimentary rocks is a proxy for the environmental conditions at the time of deposition, in particular the runoff that moved and deposited the material forming the rocks. Settling of sediment is strongly influenced by the gravity of a planetary body. As a consequence, sorting of a sedimentary rock varies with gravity for a given depth and velocity of surface runoff. Theoretical considerations for spheres indicate that sorting is less uniform on Mars than on Earth for runoff of identical depth. The effects of gravity on flow hydraulics limit the use of common, semi-empirical models developed to simulate particle settling in terrestrial environments, on Mars. Assessing sedimentation patterns on Mars, aimed at identifying strata potentially hosting traces of life, is potentially affected by such uncertainties. Using first-principle approaches, e.g. through Computational Fluid Dynamics, for calculating settling velocities on other planetary bodies requires a large effort and is limited by the values of boundary conditions, e.g. the shape of the particle. The degree of uncertainty resulting from the differences in gravity on Earth and Mars was therefore tested during three reduced-gravity flights, the MarsSedEx I and II missions, conducted in November 2012 and 2013. Nine types of sediment, ranging in size, shape and density were tested in custom-designed settling tubes during parabolas of Martian gravity lasting 20 to 25 seconds. Based on the observed settling velocities, the uncertainties of empirical relationships developed on Earth to assess particle settling on Mars are discussed. In addition, the potential effects of reduced gravity on patterns of erosion, transport and sorting of sediment, including the implications for identifying strata bearing traces of past life on are examined.",

            "abstract": "There is an urgent need to design and implement transformative governance strategies that safeguard Earth’s life-support systems essential for long-term human well-being. From a series of meetings of the Continental Margins Working Group co-sponsored by IMBER and LOICZ of IGBP, we conclude that the greatest urgency exists at the ocean-land interface – the continental margins or the Margin – which extends from coastlands over continental shelves and slopes bordering the deep ocean. The Margin is enduring quadruple squeeze from (i) Population growth and rising demands for resources; (ii) Ecosystem degradation and loss; (iii) Rising CO2, climate change and alteration of marine biogeochemistry and ecosystems; and (iv) Rapid and irreversible changes in social-ecological systems. Some areas of the Margin that are subject to the greatest pressures (e.g. the Arctic) are also those for which knowledge of fundamental processes remains most limited. Aside from improving our basic understanding of the nature and variability of the Margin, priority issues include: (i) investment reform to prevent lethal but profitable activities; (ii) risk reduction; and (iii) jurisdiction, equity and fiscal responsibility. However, governance deficits or mismatches are particularly pronounced at the ocean-edge of the Margin and the prevailing Law of the Sea is incapable of resolving these challenges. The “gold rush” of accelerating demands for space and resources, and variability in how this domain is regulated, move the Margin to the forefront of global sustainability research and action. We outline a research strategy in 3 engagement arenas: (a) knowledge and understanding of dynamic Margin processes; (b) development, innovation and risk at the Margin; and (c) governance for sustainability on the Margin. The goals are (1) to better understand Margin social-ecological systems, including their physical and biogeochemical components; (2) to develop practical guidance for sustainable development and use of resources; (3) to design governance regimes to stem unsustainable practices; (4) to investigate how to enable equitable sharing of costs and benefits from sustainable use of resources; and (5) to evaluate alternative research approaches and partnerships that address the challenges faced on the Margin.",

            "abstract": "Drought is commonly defined as a temporary lack of water compared to normal conditions. In the traditional definition used in the natural sciences (climate science, hydrology, earth science) only natural drivers are included and the human effect on water resources is excluded. Drought impact studies, however, using observed crop yields, wildfire data, reservoir information, etc., can hardy make this division. The interdisciplinarity of drought asks for a broader definition that considers the interplay between the hazard, impacts and management. In the IPCC-SREX report definitional issues are mentioned as one of the reasons that no clear conclusions can be drawn about historic and future changes in drought. Human activities related to drought are mentioned by IPCC, but not included in their definition of drought. In the anthropocene the human aspects of drought can no longer be neglected. The IAHS Panta Rhei initiative, for example, urges hydrologists to include the connection with human systems. We propose a paradigm shift in the definition of drought, namely to expand it to include the effects of human action. For attribution we can then distinguish between climate-induced drought and human-induced drought. In this presentation, we will present a conceptual diagram that will do justice to the interdisciplinarity of drought. We will discuss issues of variability and change, scale (both temporal and spatial scales), feedbacks, and direct and indirect anthropogenic effects. The revised definition provides recognition and a common ground to researchers in all fields of research and is better aligned with drought impacts and with stakeholders’ and policy maker’s views on drought.",

We confirmed the presence of earthward flows which can be associated with north-south auroral streamers during the substorm growth phase. At around X = −12 Earth radii (Re), the northward magnetic field and its elevation angle decreased markedly approximately 4 min before substorm onset. A northward magnetic-field increase associated with pre-onset earthward flows was found at around X = −17Re. This variation indicates the occurrence of the local depolarization. Interestingly, in the region earthwards of X = −18Re, earthward flows in the central plasma sheet (CPS) reduced significantly about 3min before substorm onset. However, the earthward flows enhanced again at t = −60 sec in the region around X = −14 Re, and they moved toward the Earth. At t = 0, the dipolarization of the magnetic field started at X ~ -10 Re, and simultaneously the magnetic reconnection started at X ~ −20 Re. Synthesizing these results, we can confirm the validity of our catapult current sheet relaxation model.",

            "abstract": "As GRACE has observed time-varying gravity longer than a decade, long-term mass changes have been emerged. In particular, linear trends and accelerated patterns in Antarctica were reported and paid attention for the projection of sea level rise. The cause of accelerated ice mass loss in Antarctica is not known since its amplitude is not significantly larger than ice mass change associated with natural climate variations. In this study, we consider another uncertainty in Antarctic ice mass loss acceleration due to unmodeled atmospheric pressure field. We first compare GRACE AOD product with in-situ atmospheric pressure data from SCAR READER project. GRACE AOD (ECMWF) shows spurious jump near Transantarctic Mountains, which is due to the regular model update of ECMWF. In addition, GRACE AOD shows smaller variations than in-situ observation in coastal area. This is possibly due to the lower resolution of GRACE AOD, and thus relatively stable ocean bottom pressure associated with inverted barometric effect suppresses the variations of atmospheric pressure near coast. On the other hand, GRACE AOD closely depicts in-situ observations far from oceans. This is probably because GRACE AOD model (ECMWF) is assimilated with in-situ observations. However, the in-situ observational sites in interior of Antarctica are sparse, and thus it is still uncertain the reliability of GRACE AOD for most region of Antarctica. To examine this, we cross-validate three different reanalysis; ERA Interim, NCEP DOE and MERRA. Residual atmospheric pressure fields as a measure of atmospheric pressure errors, NCEP DOE – ERA Interim or MERRA – ERA Interim, show long-term changes, and the estimated uncertainty in acceleration of Antarctic ice mass change is about 9 Gton/yr^2 from 2003 to 2012. This result implies that the atmospheric surface pressure error likely hinders the accurate estimate of the ice mass loss acceleration in Antarctica.",

            "abstract": "Melt inclusions record more extreme isotopic variability than their bulk host lavas and offer the potential to better constrain mantle components that contribute to magmatism. Isotopic analyses of melt inclusions are, however, challenging because of their limited size. To date, Sr and Pb isotope data have been obtained for oceanic islands by application of in situ analysis techniques, either by SIMS or LA-(MC)-ICPMS. Comprehensive studies of inclusions from other settings have yet to be performed. Here, we report the first combined Sr and Nd isotope data on individual melt inclusions from Pliocene-Quaternary K-rich lavas from mainland Italy, obtained using wet chemistry techniques and TIMS analysis. We use newly developed 1013 Ohm resistors mounted in the feedback loop of Faraday cup amplifiers. Compared to default 1011 Ohm resistors, use of 1013 Ohm resistors results in a 10-fold improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio and more precise data when analysing small ion beams (< 20 mV). Twenty-one olivine hosted (85 – 92 mol % Fo) melt inclusions from seven volcanic centres along the Italian peninsula were analysed. Inclusions were homogenised and analysed for trace elements prior to isotopic analysis. 87Sr/86Sr ratios in the melt inclusions range from 0.70508 to 0.71543; 143Nd/144Nd ratios from 0.51175 to 0.51268. Significant differences in 87Sr/86Sr and 143Nd/144Nd were found between melt inclusions and host lavas indicating distinct evolution paths for the lava groundmasses and the primitive melts that were trapped in the phenocrysts. The isotopic variability is interpreted to be the result of (1) mixing of melts derived from a heterogeneous mantle modified by subduction-related metasomatism, (2) mingling of distinct batches of olivine-bearing magma within a plumbing system, and (3) local assimilation of crustal material. These preliminary data suggest that combined analysis of individual melt inclusions for trace elements and Sr-Nd isotope ratios is a promising tool for identifying distinct components in magma source regions in complex tectonic settings.",

The way we handle software has a significant influence on the quality of research results, their traceability and reproducibility.\nIn order to strengthen the recognition of scientific results achieved by software and to improve its visibility, the scientific community is actively working on concepts and solutions enabling researchers to publish software, cite it and be credited for it.\nFor software to be a valuable and citeable contribution to science, the publication of scientific software must meet the quality criteria of the scientific discourse. As with data publication, defined processes and persistent identifiers should be used to make the results of research reproducible. Also, the specific needs of research have to be addressed and joined with experience gained in the field of development of free and open source software. A common understanding of handling scientific software with defined processes must be developed jointly. These processes have to address questions regarding quality assurance, versioning and documentation, traceability, reproducibility and reusability. Furthermore, the archiving of source code and executables, the use of persistent identifiers, and metrics measuring productivity, impact, and recognition have to be addressed.\nEspecially when looking at software in the context of scientific publications only insufficient solutions exist to date. Even though it is possible to mint DOIs to identify archived source code copies, quality ensured by reviews is not addressed properly. But deserving credit for a software publication requires measures assessing the value of the published software. Subject-specific reviews paired with software-specific expertise would open up new possibilities leveraging interdisciplinarity and the interplay of complementary scientific fields such as geosciences and computer science. Thus software publications and properly arranged reviews would foster the exchange in order to establish best practices from computer science in geosciences and to enhance subject-specific software successively after its original publication.",

We use a three-dimensional hybrid model of plasma and an empirical model of magnetic anomalies. We examine the effects of low and high dynamic pressures on this interaction while the Gerasimovich magnetic anomaly is located at nearly 30o and 60o solar zenith angles. We find that for the low dynamic pressure the crustal fields deflect the solar wind plasma around and form a plasma void at very close distances to the Moon (below 20 km above the surface). This is while during the high dynamic pressure the plasma void disappears and the solar wind plasma is less deflected. The deflection is associated with an electrostatic potential difference of nearly 250 and 150 V on the lunar surface during the low and high dynamic pressures, respectively, which are consistent with the observations.",

By using horizontal SEM, which decomposes the physical domain into smaller pieces with a small communication stencil, we can achieve a high level of scalability. Also by using vertical FDM, we provide an easy way for coupling the dynamics and existing physics packages.\nThe Euler equations used here are in a flux form based on the hybrid sigma hydrostatic pressure vertical coordinate, which are similar to those used in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Within these Euler equations, we use a time-split third-order Runge-Kutta (RK3) for the time discretization.\nIn order to establish robustness, firstly the NH dynamical core is verified in a simplified two dimensional (2D) slice framework by conducting widely used standard benchmark tests, and then we verify the global three dimensional (3D) dynamical core on the cubed-sphere grid with several test cases introduced by Dynamical Core Model Intercomparison Project (DCMIP).",

            "abstract": "In this report the empirical methodology for prediction of climate dynamics is suggested. We construct the dynamical models of data patterns connected with climate indices, from observed spatially distributed time series. The models are based on artificial neural network (ANN) parameterization and have a form of discrete stochastic evolution operator mapping some sequence of systems state on the next one [1]. Different approaches to reconstruction of empirical basis (phase variables) for system's phase space representation, which is appropriate for forecasting the climate index of interest, are discussed in the report; for this purpose both linear and non-linear data expansions are considered. The most important point of the methodology is finding the optimal structural parameters of the model such as dimension of variable vector, i.e. number of principal components used for modeling, the time lag used for prediction, and number of neurons in ANN determining the quality of approximation. Actually, we need to solve the model selection problem, i.e. we want to obtain a model of optimal complexity in relation to analyzed time series. We use MDL approach [2] for this purpose: the model providing best data compression is chosen. The method is applied to space-distributed time-series of sea surface temperature and sea level pressure taken from IRI datasets [3]: the ability of proposed models to predict different climate indices (incl. Multivariate ENSO index, Pacific Decadal Oscillation index, North-Atlantic Oscillation index) is investigated.\n",

Except small electric field, the main characteristics of these plasma bubbles are similar with those associated with dipolarization front (DF) in the mid-tail and near-Earth tail. Based on the different dipolarization of the magnetic field, we defined the plasma bubble with no dipolarization phenomenon as “no dipolarization bubble” (NDB), the plasma bubble with dipolarization phenomenon as “dipolarization bubble” (DB). We find that these plasma bubbles in the inner magnetosphere accompany the energetic electron acceleration. Some pancake-type distributions of energetic electrons inside the NDB in the inner magnetosphere are caused by drift betatron acceleration, other pancake-type distributions of energetic electrons inside the NDB are caused by gyrobetatron acceleration. For the DB in the inner magnetosphere, the cigar-type distributions of energetic electrons are attributed to Fermi acceleration. Our observations suggest that the inner magnetosphere may be a very important source region for energetic electrons, except for a reconnection site in the mid-tail and the plasma sheet in the near-Earth tail.",

Since climate is expected to keep changing, the adaptation which is considered optimal at a certain time may become insufficient later. Several existing studies have proposed a concept termed “adaptation pathways” that are generated based on the assumption that another option needs to be implemented if a certain option no longer meets specific objectives (Haasnoot et al., 2012). We developed nation-wise adaptation pathways globally for wheat production under the projected climate change over the 21st century. We considered two adaptation options: (1) expanding irrigation infrastructure; and (2) switching crop varieties. We calculated wheat yield with varying irrigated area and the number of selectable crop varieties using a crop model called M-GAEZ. Then we generated adaptation pathways to maintain current country-based yield. We found that both the adaptation pathways and yield changes led were different among countries. In this session, we argue the difference in optimal timing and variety of adaptation options among countries.",

            "abstract": "Successful communication and collaboration entails mutual understanding, and transfer, of information. The risk of misunderstanding and/or miscommunication between collaborating groups is tackled in different ways around the globe; some are well documented whereas others may be unknown outside particular groups, whether defined geographically or by specialism. For example; in some countries legally binding contracts define the terms of collaboration. Some regions place greater emphasis on developing trust relationships, and sometimes an official agreement is implied, such as many electronic data transfers on the web.\nInternational collaboration on climate change increasingly involves electronic data exchange (e.g. open access publications, shared documents, data repositories etc.) and with this increased reliance on electronic data a need has arisen for scientists to collaborate both internationally and cross-disciplinarily particularly with information technology and data management specialists. Trust of data and metadata on the internet (e.g. privacy, legitimacy etc.) varies, possibly due to a lack of internationally agreed standards for data governance and management, leaving many national, regional and institutional practices tailored to the needs of that group only.\nIt is proposed that building trust relationships between cross-disciplinary and international groups could help facilitate further communication, understanding and benefits from the relationship, while still maintaining independence as separate groups. Complex international cross-disciplinary group relationship dynamics are not easily mapped and producing a set of trust building rules that can be applied to any current and future collaboration with equal validity may be unfeasible. An alternative to such a set of rules may be found in a Trust Manager, whose role is to improve mutually beneficial knowledge exchange between groups, build trust and increase future collaborative potential. This presentation will report on the potential of trust management to improve international cross disciplinary climate change collaboration.",

The Halilbağı Unit comprises slices of lawsonite- and/or epidote-bearing blueschist and eclogite, as well as meta-chert and marble. The unit is overlain by an ophiolitic slab and underlain by a HP/LT metamorphosed carbonate platform. Previous studies of the Halilbağı Unit suggested tectonic blocks were metamorphosed under diverse peak conditions, but shared a common exhumation P–T path marked by syn-decompression cooling (Davis and Whitney, 2006; Çetinkaplan et al., 2008).\nTo better understand the internal structure and dynamics of this subduction complex, we carried out Lu–Hf geochronology on garnet (grt) and lawsonite (lws) from a variety of HP oceanic rocks, as well as the sub-ophiolitic metamorphic sole. Our results suggest that intra-oceanic subduction started at ~110 Ma (grt–amph isochron from a grt amphibolite). Less than 23 Myr later, the subduction interface was refrigerated enough to allow clockwise P–T loops (~87 Ma peak grt–matrix isochron for a lws+grt-bearing eclogitic blueschist) and syn-decompression cooling (~79 Ma retrograde lws–matrix isochron) of subducted oceanic rocks.\nWe will present further results for several HP metamorphic sub-facies (e.g., epidote (ep) eclogite, lws+ep blueschist, lws blueschist, lws eclogite). Such data may allow unraveling whether the co-occurrence of “warm” (i.e., ep-bearing), and “cold” (i.e., lws-bearing) HP rocks in the same locality results from (a) sampling of distinct levels of the subduction slab, (b) thermal maturation of the juvenile subduction zone, or (c) inaccurate P–T estimates. Novel natural constraints are thus expected on the dynamics of the Halilbağı Unit and of subduction complexes in general.\n Çetinkaplan M., Candan O., Oberhänsli R. and Bousquet R., 2008.

            "abstract": "Weathering zone’s mineral and chemical compositions reflect the processes that govern denudation. We study 0-2500 μm thick weathering zones that evolve below carbonate bedrock surfaces, which experienced prolong denudation under Mediterranean climate, in the Judea Hills, Israel. Samples were collected from exposed (n=13) and terra-rossa covered (n=12) surfaces. In a previous study, denudation rates were calculated for the exposed bedrock samples. Since most of the terra-rossa volume is derived from an aeolian source, we do not consider it an integral part of the rock weathering zone. Bulk rock compositions range from limestone to dolomite, and frequently consist of a mixture of calcite and dolomite minerals. We analyzed major and trace elements across the weathering zones using a laser-ablation ICPMS system. Selected samples were further analyzed with an electron-probe. The extent of weathering zones is marked by the variation of element concentrations near the rock surface (relatively to the bulk rock), at depths of 0-500 μm and 0-2500 μm in exposed and terra-rossa covered surfaces, respectively. These zones are characterized by a relatively high porosity resulting from carbonate-mineral dissolution below the surface. Correlation analyses within each profile reveal three major elemental correlations: (1) Mg-Sr-U correlation results from variation in the abundance of the mineral dolomite. These elements are typically depleted toward the surface, due to preferential dissolution of dolomite crystals and precipitation of secondary calcite; (2) Al-Si correlation results from variations in the abundance of clay minerals, which may concentrate as an insoluble residue, or derive from the outer environment; and, (3) P-Y-REE correlation is highly enriched toward the surface, suggesting contribution from the outer environment.\nIn contrast to silicate rocks, the extent and intensity of the weathering zones of exposed carbonate surfaces are decoupled from denudation rates. Weathering zones in carbonates result from dissolution beneath the rock surface. In exposed bedrock, porosity is suggested to be driven by endolithic organisms. Below terra-rossa cover, porosity increases with mineral heterogeneity, as mixed calcite-dolomite rocks tend to develop thicker and more intense weathering zones.",

            "abstract": "The Piedmont region of the southeastern United States is characterized by rolling topography, high precipitation, heavily weathered soils, and, after the immigration of European settlers, heavy anthropogenic degradation. Starting in the early eighteenth century and lasting until the early twentieth, intensive cultivation of cotton and tobacco dramatically altered the physical and biogeochemical landscape. Over roughly two centuries it has been estimated that the southern Piedmont lost 17 cm of soil to erosion due to the aforementioned cultivation, combined with poor erosion controls and annual precipitation of 1300 mm. The 20 km2 Calhoun Experimental Forest was opened in 1947 as a unit of the Sumter National Forest in upstate South Carolina to study what we would now term restoration ecology on such a heavily degraded landscape, which it did until it was closed as an active research site in the 1960’s. It left behind an extensive hydrologic and climatologic record in four small watersheds over the roughly twenty year period of active research, flow gauging infrastructure in the form of four v-notch weirs, and a compelling but currently incomplete story of the critical zone lying at the intersection of long-term critical zone evolution and rapid, anthropogenic degradation of that same critical zone. With the designation of Calhoun as the newest Critical Zone Observatory we now begin to address the questions originally sought by the Calhoun experimental forest: how the critical zone evolves after centuries of heavy degradation and to what degree that evolution could be considered recovery. Here we present preliminary findings derived from historic data and from the initial stages of a multi-faceted field campaign including soil and geophysical surveys, spatially distributed soil and stream hydrologic measurements, and high-resolution terrain analysis to characterize the spatial extent of degradation or recovery and begin to constrain the temporal trajectory of this heavily impacted critical zone.",

            "abstract": "Both static and dynamic gravimetric surveys are widely used to monitor magmatic processes in active volcanic settings. However, attributing residual gravimetric signals solely to magma movement can result in misdiagnosis of a volcano’s pre-eruptive state and incorrect assessment of hazard. The relative contribution of magmatic and aqueous fluids to integrated gravimetric and geodetic data has become an important topic for debate, particularly in restless caldera systems. Groundwater migration driven by volcanically-induced pressure changes, and groundwater mass fluctuations associated with seasonal and inter-annual variations in recharge may also contribute to measured gravity changes.\nHere we use numerical models to explore potential gravimetric signals associated with fundamental hydrological processes, focusing on variations in recharge and hydrogeological properties. TOUGH2 simulations demonstrate the significance of groundwater storage within a thick unsaturated zone (up to 100 m). Changes are dominantly in response to inter-annual recharge variations and can produce measurable absolute gravity variations of several 10s of μgal. Vadose zone storage and the rate of response to recharge changes depend on the hydrological properties. Porosity, relative and absolute permeability and capillary pressure conditions all affect the amplitude and frequency of modelled gravity time series. Spatial variations in hydrologic properties and importantly, hydrological recharge, can significantly affect the phase and amplitude of recorded gravity signals.\nOur models demonstrate the potential for an appreciable hydrological component within gravimetric measurements on volcanic islands. Characterisation of hydrological processes within a survey area may be necessary to robustly interpret gravity signals in settings with significant recharge fluctuations, a thick vadose zone and spatially variable hydrological properties. Such modelling enables further exploration of feedbacks between volcanic and hydrological systems, and the geophysical signals used to monitor them.",

            "abstract": "International Pellet Watch (IPW) is an ongoing global monitoring of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) using preproduction plastic resin pellets. These pellets are easily collected and transported allowing the general public worldwide to get involved. Thus, risk communication toward the pellet collectors is a significant part of IPW to ensure continuous effort and interest. The pellet samples were analyzed for polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and degradation products (DDTs), and hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs). Additional pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and Hopanes were also analyzed for some samples. Analytical results showed distinct patterns with high concentrations (< 200ng/g-pellet) of PCBs in urban and industrialized areas mainly in the United States, Japan, and some European countries. These countries are prone to legacy pollution where PCBs were used extensively before the ban in the late 1980’s. Pesticide DDTs instead were found to be higher in developing countries such as Brazil and Vietnam (> 500ng/g-pellet). These countries may still be using DDTs as a vector control mostly to combat malaria. High concentrations of DDTs were also found in Greece, China and Australia (> 100ng/g-pellet) suggesting the possibility of illegal usage as pesticide or anti fouling paint. HCHs concentrations were mostly low due to its low retention in the environment. However, high HCHs concentrations were mostly found in the southern hemisphere. Very high concentration of PAHs in pellet samples can be utilized for early identification of recent oil pollution. High PAHs concentration in Tauranga, New Zealand was found to be caused by local oil spill. Hopanes in pellets can be used for source identification of oil pollution. Global mapping and comparison among IPW data can be used to provide better explanations to IPW volunteers by sorting concentrations into pollution categories. Communication reports are tailor written based on the volunteers familiarity to IPW’s issues, educational background, occupation and their potential to further spread awareness. Based on feedbacks, the volunteers were grateful to receive reports of their samples felt personally involved in IPW. This was shown to empowered and encouraged efforts from the volunteers.",

            "abstract": "The Aerosol Radiative Forcing in East Asia (A-FORCE) aircraft campaign was conducted at 0-9 km in altitude over East Asia in March-April 2009 to investigate transport and removal processes of aerosols, their physical and chemical properties, and cloud microphysical properties in Asian outflow. In this study, mechanisms of vertical transport of black carbon (BC) aerosols and their three-dimensional transport pathways over East Asia in spring were examined through numerical simulations for the A-FORCE campaign using a modified version of the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system. The simulations reproduced the spatial distributions of mass concentration of BC and its transport efficiency observed by the A-FORCE campaign reasonably well, including its vertical and latitudinal gradients and dependency on precipitation amount that air parcels experienced during the transport. During the A-FORCE period, two types of pronounced upward BC mass fluxes from the planetary boundary layer (PBL) to the free troposphere (FT) were found over northeastern and inland-southern China. Over northeastern China, cyclones with modest precipitation were the primary uplifting mechanism of BC. Over inland-southern China, both cumulus convection and orographic uplifting along the slopes of the Tibetan Plateau played important roles in the upward transport of BC, despite its efficient wet deposition due to a large amount of precipitation supported by an abundant moisture supply by the low-level southerlies. In addition to the midlatitude (35–45°N) eastward outflow within the PBL (21% BC removal by precipitation during transport), the uplifting of BC over northeastern and inland-southern China and the subsequent BC transport by the midlatitude lower tropospheric (50% BC removal) and subtropical (25–35°N) midtropospheric westerlies (67% BC removal), respectively, provided the major transport pathways for BC export from continental East Asia to the Pacific.",

            "abstract": "Along the Japan Trench, M7 class earthquakes have occurred in the past. Among them, earthquakes off the coast of Miyagi prefecture have occurred with recurrence intervals of approximately 30-40 years. The M 7.2 earthquake in 2005 is the latest before 2011. On 11 March 2011, the M 9.0 great interplate earthquake occurred off the coast of the Tohoku district (including Miyagi). Currently, it has been passed for more than three years since the M 9.0 earthquake. Post-seismic deformation has continued today, and Off-Miyagi earthquake has not occurred yet.\nWe numerically simulated cycles for occurrences of seismic and aseismic events along the Japan Trench with the 3D geometry of the Pacific plate using the aging law, which is a type of rate- and state-dependent friction law. We evaluated simulation results achieved using different values of frictional parameters with respect to characteristics such as the slip history and crustal deformation before the Tohoku-Oki earthquake.\nBefore the Tohoku-Oki earthquake, two slow slip events (SSEs) were observed on 2008 and 2011. The M=7.3 largest foreshock occurred on March 9 [Ito et al., 2013]. Source areas of the mainshock, the foreshock, and the SSEs are in the updip area of the Off-Miyagi earthquakes and post-seismic slip of the M9 earthquake.\nBy now, we have approximately reproduced some characteristics of observed slips by using several sets of frictional parameter values. In our simulations, M=7.0-7.6 foreshock occurred 0.4~7 days before the mainshock (M=8.6-9.0). And the foreshock occurred within 10 years after the M=7.2-7.3 earthquake at Off-Miyagi. In these models, time interval between the mainshock and the first Off-Miyagi earthquake after the great earthquake tend to be shorter than the average recurrence interval of the past. This tendency was observed at Indonesia. Two M7 class earthquakes occurred before (2002) and after (2008) the 2004 Sumatra earthquake (M9.1). The source regions were at the south end of the rupture zone of the 2004 earthquake and the north end of the rupture zone of the 2005 Nias Island earthquake (M8.6) [Shearer & Burgmann, 2010]. We are now improving our model to reproduce other characteristics. Based on some of the reasonable results achieved, we will discuss possible scenarios for spatial-temporal evolution of slip after M9 class earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Since the last volcanic unrest occurred in 1976-77, the Guadeloupe Volcanological and Seismological Observatory (OVSG-IPGP) has recorded a systematic progressive increasing of the volcanic activity in term of seismicity and degassing, with the progressive reactivations of fumarolles. Between 1981 and 2013, this activity is characterized by a low magnitude seismicity occurred in swarm sequences. Observatory’s standard locations shows that more than 95% of seismic events is concentrated in a volume of ∼ 125 km3 in the shallow part of the volcano (5 kms ×5 kms × 5 kms), centred below the andesitic dome. Following these features, we investigated the relationship between this seismicity and the dynamic of the hydrothermal system. First, we perform an iterative travel times delays inversion to estimate the Vp/Vs ratio and study physical and rheological medium properties and his evolution. Then, we analyse the b-value behaviour before to perform an autoregressive analysis on codas of monochromatique events to identify sources of resonance phenomena. Finally, we perform a multiplet analysis by waveform cross-correlation to identify repetitive sources. Global b-value (∼ 1.33) and low Vp/Vs (∼ 1.50) resulting suggest the presence of hydrothermal fluids in a fractured and altered medium which is in good agreement with results of autoregressive analysis. Considering their temporal and spatial evolutions, we are able to estimate a storage depth of fluids mixage and we can infer a temporal overpressure in the system. Following the multiplets analysis results, we highlight a brutal dynamic change after the major local earthquake of Les Saintes (21 November 2004, M=6.3). In summary, we can infer that seismic events occurred at La Soufrière volcano are related to two different source mechanisms: (1) fracturing processes of rocks and (2) resonance of cracks or conduits filled with hydrothermal fluid with a brutal change by a stress modification within the volcano structure.

Terrestrial gravity coverage has for the same reasons been relatively sparse, with an older NRL high-level airborne survey of the interior being the only gravity field data over the interior, and terrain and ice thickness models being insufficient both in terms of resolution and accuracy. This data situation has in the later years changed substantially, first of all due to GOCE, but also due to new DTU-Space and NASA IceBridge airborne gravity, ice thickness data from IceBridge and European airborne measurements, and new terrain models from ASTER, SPOT-5 and digital photogrammetry.\nIn the paper we use all available data to make a new geoid of Greenland and surrounding ocean regions, using remove-restore techniques for ice and topography, spherical FFT techniques and downward continuation by least squares collocation. The impact of GOCE and the new terrestrial data yielded a much improved geoid. Due to the lack of of levelling data connecting scattered towns, the new geoid is validated by local sea level and dynamic ocean topography data, and specially collected GPS-tide gauge profile data along fjords. The comparisons show significant improvements over EGM08 and older geoid models, and also highlight the problems of global sea level models, especially in sea ice covered regions, and the definition of a new consistent vertical datum of Greenland.",

            "abstract": "The distribution, enrichment and ecotoxocity potential of Bangladesh part of Sundarban mangrove was investigated for eight trace metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb and Zn) using sediment quality assessment indices. The average concentration of trace metals in the sediments exceeded the crustal abundance suggesting sources other than natural in origin. Additionally, the trace metals profile may be a reflection of socio-economic development in the vicinity of Sundarban which further attributes trace metals abundance to the anthropogenic inputs. Geoaccumulation index suggests moderately polluted sediment quality w.r.t. Ni and As and background concentrations for Al, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Pb, Co, As and Cd. Contamination factor analysis suggested low contamination by Zn, Cr, Co and Cd, moderate by Fe, Mn, Cu and Pb while Ni and As show considerable and high contamination, respectively. Enrichment factors for Ni, Pb and As suggests high contamination from either biota or anthropogenic inputs besides natural enrichment. As per the three sediment quality guidelines, Fe, Mn, Cu, Ni, Co and As would be more of a concern with respect to ecotoxicological risk in the Sundarban mangroves. The correlation between various physiochemical variables and trace metals suggested significant role of fine grained particles (clay) in trace metal distribution whereas owing to low organic carbon content in the region the organic complexation may not be playing significant role in trace metal distribution in the Sundarban mangroves.",

            "abstract": "Lake Towuti (2.75o S, 121.5o E; 560 km2, 205 m WD) is a tectonic, ferruginous, and hyposulfidic lake in central Sulawesi, Indonesia. The region’s tropical climate causes intense chemical weathering and fast denudation of the ultramafic bedrock surrounding the lake supplying metal rich lateritic weathering products to the lake. Lake Towuti is thermally stratified, with anoxic conditions below ~140m water depth, that promote reductive dissolution of metal oxides in its bottom waters and surface sediments. The upper 90m of the water column mix during the dry season due to evaporative cooling of the surface waters.\nWe infer that the burial efficiency of redox-sensitive metals is closely linked and extremely sensitive to the climatically controlled mixing state of Lake Towuti. Indeed, results from our piston cores covering the past 60kyr document that the concentration of individual redox-sensitive metals in Towuti’s sediments is up to 30% higher during the dry MIS 2 compared to wetter periods of MIS 3 and the Holocene, likely as a result of better preservation of metal oxides in a well-oxygenated water column and surface sediment. Highest (>2x) enrichment factors for redox-sensitive metals are, however, associated with a ~1cm thick oxide layer occurring at the transition from the wet, early- to the drier, mid-Holocene. Enrichment of metal oxides in this layer can not entirely be explained by better preservation alone. CT and SEM analysis on the respective layer reveal the abundance of amorphous Fe/Mn- oxide nodules, indicative for diagenetic formation of these phases in pore spaces. We interpret this oxide layer as a buried redox front that formed close to or at the sediment water interface during a phase characterized by a well-ventilated water column and relatively constant and low sedimentation rate. Preservation of this oxide layer is likely a result of a rapid change in sedimentation rate and/or mixing state of the lake.\nMore detailed analyses aiming at a better characterization of the processes that shaped the environment suitable for the formation of this diagenetically formed oxide layer are currently underway and may yield valuable insight into processes that possibly controlled the formation of similar deposits in ancient ferruginous and hyposulfidic environments on Earth.",

            "abstract": "Modelling of fluvial bedrock incision is crucial for stream development. Different approaches have been proposed accounting for a variety of driving effects with the stream power model family being the most widely used. Although these models are mechanistically process-based, they are commonly applied at reach or catchment scales in landscape evolution analysis. In these applications, different models often give similar results with appropriate parameter adjustments. However, field tests are rare and there is still uncertainty of their physical plausibility at the process scale.\nWe present a temporally and qualitatively high-resolved parallel dataset of discharge, bedload transport and bedrock erosion (in minute resolution) for a flood event in an alpine torrent. Using discharge and bedload data we compare the transient behaviour of several model class predictions to the shape of the observed erosion curve and discuss the occurrence of different sediment effects. The bedload`s tools effect is shown to be the dominant driver of erosion and a simple tools-dependent model shows similarly good performance as high-developed mechanistic models.",

Low resolution data on residential water consumption, as traditionally metered, can only be used to model consumers’ behavior at an aggregate level whereas end uses breakdown and the motivations and individual attitudes of consumers are hidden.\nThe recent advent of smart meters allows gathering high frequency consumption data that can be used both to provide instantaneous information to water utilities on the state of the network and continuously inform the users on their consumption and savings.\nSmart metered data also allow for the characterization of water end uses: this information, coupled with users’ psychographic variables, constitutes the knowledge basis for developing individual and multi users models, through which water utilities can test the impact of different management strategies.\nSmartH2O is an EU funded project which aims at creating an ICT platform able to (i) capture and store quasi real time, high resolution residential water usage data measured with smart meters, (ii) infer the main determinants of residential water end uses and build customers’ behavioral models and (iii) predict how the customer behavior can be influenced by various water demand management strategies, spanning from dynamic water pricing schemes to social awareness campaigns. The project exploits a social computing approach for raising users’ awareness about water consumption and pursuing water savings in the residential sector.\nIn this work, we first present the SmartH2O platform and data collection, storage and analysis components. We then introduce some preliminary models and results on total water consumption disaggregation into end uses and single user behaviors using innovative fully automated algorithms and overcoming the need of invasive metering campaigns at the fixture level.",

            "abstract": "We examined the relationship between ice cloud microphysics retrieved from cloud radar on CloudSat and CALIOP on CALIPSO and super saturation inferred from AIRS on AQUA. Ice microphysics such as ice water content (IWC) and effective radius was estimated by CloudSat and CALIPSO data. Unique features of the algorithm is that it has been designed to use depolarization ratio from CALIOP addition to radar reflectivity factor from CloudSat and attenuated backscattering coefficient from CALIOP in order to take into account the variation of ice particle shapes and their orientations [Okamoto et al., 2010]. Water vapor density and temperature were retrieved with much finer resolution by the application of Ishimoto’s algorithm [2009] compared with standard AIRS products where horizontal resolution is 45km. The algorithm allows retrievals of water vapor density and temperature every 13.5km in horizontal direction with 1km in vertical. The retrievals are carried out when there is no cloud with its cloud top pressure <200hPa. That is, it is possible to report water vapor information above low-level clouds. Then we sampled the amount of water vapor and temperature estimated from AIRS data to match the CloudSat and CALIPSO foot-print and the data were interpolated to have the same space and time resolution of the merged data sets of CloudSat and CALIPSO, i.e., 1.1km and 240m for horizontal and vertical resolutions. In the new AIRS products, ice super saturation often reached 150% while standard AIRS products showed less frequent super saturation. The ECMWF results generally showed smaller fraction of ice super saturation compared with the new AIRS products. In order to quantitatively compare the water vapor amount and retrieved IWC, we estimated the excess of water amount respect to ice saturation by using ice super saturation. The occurrences of ice clouds inferred from CloudSat and CALIOP agreed with the occurrences of ice-supersaturation reported in the new AIRS products. The retrieved IWC were smaller compared with the estimated IWC from the new AIRS products. Similar analyses with ECMWF showed smaller estimated IWC compared with the values in the new products.",

            "abstract": "The East African Rift System (EARS) represents a key locality for the knowledge of the nature and evolution of SCLM during continental rifting processes, traditionally ascribed to ascending mantle plumes. We report petrological and geothermobarometric data from mantle xenoliths in Quaternary alkali-basalt lava flows and scoria cones at Mega (Sidamo Region; EARS) in the southern Main Ethiopian Rift (MER), that give evidence for refertilization of SCLM and for thinning during Tertiary rifting. Studied samples consist of seven lherzolites, five harzburgites and one olivine-websterite that contain spinel-pyroxene symplectites, interpreted as products of garnet breakdown reactions. These rocks were analyzed for major (whole rock and minerals) and trace elements (pyroxenes). Major element data have been used to reconstruct original garnet composition (pyrope). Equilibration temperatures range from 985 ± 40°C in the garnet facies (2.9-2.2 GPa) to 960 ± 55°C in the spinel facies (1.3 GPa). Xenoliths consist of depleted and fertile peridotites. Five lherzolites have up to 4 wt% of CaO, high CaO/Al2O3 (1.42-4.46), and the most fertile are more enriched than primitive mantle. Variations of major oxides in bulk rocks and minerals are consistent with variable degrees of melt extraction. Evidence for modal and cryptic metasomatism is given by addition of clinopyroxene ± phlogopite, and by LILE and LREE enrichment in clinopyroxene. Refertilization process appears to have been induced by sub-lithospheric volatile-rich melts at high melt/rock ratio, and were followed by cooling. To account for the geodynamic evolution of SCLM beneath the southern MER, which implies a temperature gradient from 50-60 to ∼ 90 mW/m2, we propose that thinning of the base of fertile SCLM from 90-95 to ∼45km depth and associated magmatism occurred along a normal-mantle adiabat above an upwelling asthenosphere (i.e., decompression melting) without the need for significant heat sources.",

Especially, environmental educations recognized as one of the most important ESD have developed in many countries including Japan, but most of those are still mainly experiences in nature. Those could develop “Respect for Environment” of the educational targets of ESD, however we would have to take a further step in order to enhance “Ability of analysis and thinking logically about the environment” which are also targets of ESD.\nThus, we developed experienced-learning program about atmospheric particulate matter (PM2.5), for understanding the state of the environment objectively based on quantitative data. PM2.5 is known for harmful, and various human activities are considered a source of it, therefore environmental standards for PM2.5 have been established in many countries. This program was tested on junior high school students of 13 – 15 years old, and the questionnaire survey also was conducted to them before and after the program for evaluating educational effects.\nStudents experienced to measure the concentration of PM2.5 at 5 places around their school in a practical manner. The measured concentration of PM2.5 ranged from 19 to 41 μg/m3/day, that value at the most crowded roadside exceeded Japan’s environmental standard (35 μg/m3/day). Many of them expressed “Value of PM2.5 is high” in their individual discussion notes. As a consistent with that, the answer “Don’t know” to the question \"What do you think about the state of the air?\" markedly decreased after the program, on the other hand the answer “Pollution” to the same question increased instead. From above-mentioned, it was considered that they could judge the state of the air objectively. Consequently, the questionnaire result “Concern about Air Pollution” increased significantly after the program compared to before. Additionally, they seemed to try to think logically about what influenced PM2.5, focusing on various factors such as traffic (car), wind direction and velocity, which were frequently-appearing words in the text-mining of discussion notes.",

            "abstract": "Our study is based on the receiver-function (RF) analysis of a hypothetical regional geological model that extends from oceanic to thick cratonic lithosphere. RF techniques are used to study the interior of Earth. Teleseismic P waves are followed by a series of scattered waves, which occur due to P-to-S converted phases. The sequence of these scattered waves on a time series can be represented by receiver function (RF) for the station and may vary with the incidence angle and azimuth of the incoming P-wave. Here we use iterative deconvolution method to study receiver functions, which provides RF estimates with low noise levels. This method is based on least-squares minimization of the difference between the observed horizontal seismogram and a predicted signal generated by the convolution of an iterative spike train with the vertical-component of seismogram.\nThe study is based on a hypothetical model (800x800x400km) on a mesh with 10 km grid spacing that is smoothly embedded within a standard global Earth model. Physical properties of the regional model match with prescribed surface heat-flow and geoid boundary conditions computed using an approach based on thermodynamics, mineral physics, and solid-Earth geophysics. The model also incorporates seismic anisotropy in the mantle beneath the hypothetical continent. A three dimensional model is computed that approximates the mantle flow around the hypothetical continental lithospheric keel. The anisotropy is computed from the flow model and is incorporated to the model. Synthetic seismograms are computed using SPECFEM3D_GLOBE, which provides full wave-equation modelling of seismic wave propagation incorporating material properties such as anisotropy, attenuation and fluid-solid interfaces. To ensure a realistic (non-ideal) azimuthal distribution, the event locations are based on a subset of a ten-year global catalog from 2001 to 2010 within the magnitude range from 6.0 to 7.0.",

This represents an exchange of energy from dissociated carbohydrate bonds to phosophoester bonds. These bonds are available to phosphorylate organic compounds or hydrolyze to Pi, driving many biochemical processes.\nThe benthic bacteria T. namibiensis 1 and Beggiatoa 2 condense Pi into phosphate polymers in oxygenated environments. These polyphosphates (polyPs) are stored until the environment becomes anoxic, when these bacteria retrieve the energy from polyP dissociation into Pi3. Dissociated Pi is released outside of the bacteria, where it precipitates as apatite.\nThe Gibbs free energy of polyP phosphoester bond hydrolysis is negative, however, the kinetics are slow4. Diatoms contain a polyP pool that is stable until after death, after which the polyPs hydrolyze and form apatite5. The roles of polyP in eukaryotic organism biochemistry continue to be discovered.\nPolyPs have a range of biochemical roles, such as bioavailable P-storage, stress adaptation, and blood clotting6. PolyP-containing granules are released from anuclear platelets to activate factor V7 and factor XII in the blood clotting process due to their polyanionic charge8. Platelets have a lifespan of approximately 8 days, after which they undergo apoptosis9. Data will be presented that demonstrate the bioactive, thermodynamically unstable polyP pool within older platelets in vitro can spontaneously hydrolyze and form phosphate minerals. This process is likely avoided by platelet digestion in the spleen and liver, possibly recycling platelet polyPs with their phosphoester bond energy for other biochemical roles.\n1 Schulz HN et al.

In this study, we use ambient noise data from USArray/Transportable Array recorded during 2007-2012 to investigate whether dispersion measurements from cross-correlations of ambient noise at short interstation distances are consistent with those at long distances and whether the short-path dispersion measurements can be used in tomography, especially in local- and regional-scale tomography. Our results show that: (1) surface wave phase velocity dispersion curves measured by a Frequency-Time Analysis technique (FTAN) from time-domain cross-correlations are consistent with those measured by a spectral method tracing the zero crossings of the real part of cross spectrum functions in frequency domain; (2) dispersion measurements from time-domain cross-correlations with short interstation distances, up to only one wavelength, are consistent with and also reliable as those with interstation distances longer than three wavelengths; and (3) these short-path measurements can be included in ambient noise tomography to improve path coverage and resolution.

            "abstract": "Degradation of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is in part, the result of the delivery of fine-grained, terrestrial sediment from catchments draining to the Coral Sea. The Burnett River, draining the GBR experienced severe flooding in 2011 and 2013 with the latter flood breaking all historical records. Huge quantities of sediment were transported to the Coral Sea. The purpose of this study was to quantify the magnitude of sediment eroded from the channel banks during the floods, long term bank-erosion rates, and cost-effective protection measures. System-wide analysis combined with numerical modeling using the Bank-Stability and Toe-Erosion Model (BSTEM) was used to determine annual bank-erosion rates over periods ranging from 4.5 to 100 years.\nAnalysis of 2009 and 2013 aerial imagery revealed that 47.3 Mt (10.4 MT/y) of sediment was eroded from the banks of the lower 300 km of the Burnett River. Erosion of these bank materials does not equate to an equal volume exported to the Coral Sea, as an unknown proportion is deposited. It can be assumed, however, that the majority of the fine-grained materials (54%) were transported out to sea. Long-term simulations (42 years) were conducted using BSTEM, to compare longer term averages with those determined by the catchment model SedNet. Over this longer time period, annual bank-erosion rates were about 3.1 Mt/y, about 18 times greater than the value predicted by SedNet. Assuming 100 years of simulation and using an empirical relation between the length of BSTEM simulations and calculated erosion rates, a conservative value for the annual rate of bank erosion is 2.0 Mt/y. The BSTEM results and analysis of aerial imagery are within 10%. Bank erosion, instead of being a minor source of sediment representing 8% of the total, was found to be the single largest contributor, representing between 44 and 73% of the total annual sediment budget. In absolute terms, this is an increase in the reported average, annual rate of bank erosion from 0.175 Mt/y to 2.0 Mt/y. The significance of bank erosion to total, fine-grained sediment loads are drastically different than those reported for the Burnett and other Reef Catchments where fields and uplands are listed as the leading sediment contributors. These results pose important implications for sediment management and protection of the GBR.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, climate change is one of the most important problems that the ecological system of the world has been encountering. Global warming and climate change have been studied frequently by all disciplines all over the world and Geomatics Engineering also contributes to such studies by means of remote sensing, global positioning system etc.\nMonitoring Land Surface Temperature (LST) via remote sensing satellites is one of the most important contributions to climatology. LST is an important parameter governing the energy balance on the Earth and there are lots of algorithms to obtain LST by remote sensing techniques. The most commonly used algorithms are split-window algorithm, temperature/emissivity separation method, mono-window algorithm and single channel method. Generally three algorithms are used to obtain LST by using Landsat 5 TM data. These algorithms are radiative transfer equation method, single channel method and mono-window algorithm. Radiative transfer equation method is not applicable because during the satellite pass, atmospheric parameters must be measured in-situ.\nIn this research, mono window algorithm was implemented to Landsat 5 TM image. Besides, meteorological data such as humidity and temperature are used in the algorithm. Acquisition date of the image is 28.08.2011 and our study area is Zonguldak, Turkey. High resolution images are used to investigate the relationships between LST and land cover type. As a result of these analyses, area with vegetation cover has approximately 5 ºC lower temperature than the city center and arid land. Because different surface properties like reinforced concrete construction, green zones and sandbank are all together in city center, LST differs about 10 ºC in the city center. The temperature around some places in thermal power plant region Çatalağzı, is about 5 ºC higher than city center. Sandbank and agricultural areas have highest temperature because of land cover structure. Thanks to this research, LST has been obtained by remote sensing technique. Satellite imagery is an effective method to retrieve LST maps for large areas. LST maps can be generated periodically by means of satellite images. So, it can not only be useful for agricultural activities but also for preparing a substructure especially for regional climate change researches.",

            "abstract": "Root-zone soil moisture content is a key variable that controls the exchange of water and energy fluxes between land and atmosphere. In the soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer (SVAT) schemes, the influence of root-zone soil moisture on evapotranspiration (ET) is parameterized by the soil moisture stress function (SSF). Dependence of actual ET: potential ET (fPET) or evaporative fraction to the root-zone soil moisture via SSF can also be used inversely to estimate root-zone soil moisture when fPET is estimated by remotely sensed land surface states.\nIn this work we present fPET versus available soil water (ASW) in the root zone observed in the experimental farm sites in Victoria, Australia in 2012-2013. In the wheat field site, fPET vs ASW exhibited distinct features for different soil depth, net radiation, and crop growth stages. Interestingly, SSF in the wheat field presented contrasting shapes for two cropping years of 2012 and 2013. We argue that different temporal patterns of rainfall (and resulting soil moisture) during the growing seasons in 2012 and 2013 are responsible for the distinctive SSFs. SSF of the wheat field was simulated by the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM). The APSIM was able to reproduce the observed fPET vs. ASW. We discuss implications of our findings for existing modeling and (inverse) remote sensing approaches relying on SSF and alternative growth-stage-dependent SSFs.",

            "abstract": "The stability and morphology of bedforms have traditionally been treated as a function of mean flow velocity/non-dimensional bed shear stress and sediment particle size, despite the known influence of key biological components such as extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). EPS is produced by microbial communities and can increase erosion thresholds by more than 300%. However, the mechanisms behind the influence of EPS on sediment transport and bedform dynamics is poorly understood, as is the fate of EPS and exchange of EPS between the sediment bed and water column during ripple formation. The exchange of EPS between the sediment bed and water column is dynamic, with important implications for a range of physical and geochemical processes, with the spatio-temporal variation in EPS content, from source to eventual fate, being extremely important for determining the behaviour and natural variability of sedimentary systems.\nThis paper reports on a series of flume experiments where a tripartite mixture of sand, clay and model EPS (xanthan gum) was used to create a sediment substrate, which was subject to a unidirectional current (0.8 ms-1 for 10.5 hrs, n=6). For each run the spatio-temporal changes in concentration, distribution, and effect of EPS, on the evolving bed of mixed sediment was monitored throughout, with complete 3D bed morphology scans also acquired at ~360 s intervals. The various substrate mixtures produced bedforms varying from ripples to dunes and biochemical analysis of EPS concentration across the formed bedforms, suggest EPS is winnowed from the sediment – water interface, particularly at the bedform crests. The depth of winnowing in each run was found to be related to the bedform size, with variation in the stoss, crest and trough of the bedforms identified. The loss of EPS was also significantly correlated with the depth to which clay was winnowed, presumably due to a close association between the clay mineral and EPS fractions. The paper will discuss how sediment processes and flow are linked by migration of dissolved and particulate substances into and out of the bed and how this exchange is affected by the topography of the sediment bed and advective pore water transfers. Finally, the implications for natural systems and larger scale sediment-biota linkages will also be discussed.",

The pitch angle distributions (0°-75°) of the cold ions observed by both C1 and C3 at the dayside magnetopause indicate that these cold ions are ionospheric outflows coming from the southern hemisphere. The cold ions (< 200 eV) fluxes are modulated by the ULF wave electric field. The cold ions move perpendicular to the magnetic field due to the enhanced convection electric field when they are close to the magnetic reconnection region. Two different populations (possibly H+ and He+) were observed in the magnetosphere.

Recent satellite missions have opened up new perspectives by offering high spatial resolution, various spectral properties, and fast revisit rates to the same regions. Here, we examine the utility of broadband red-edge spectral information in multispectral satellite image data for classifying paddy rice crops in South Korea. Additionally, we examine how object-based spectral features affect the classification of paddy rice growth stages. For the analysis, two seasons of RapidEye satellite image data were used. The results showed that the broadband red-edge information slightly improved the classification accuracy of the crop condition in heterogeneous paddy rice crop environments, particularly when single-season image data were used. This positive effect appeared to be offset by the multi-temporal image data. Additional texture information brought only a minor improvement or a slight decline, although it is well known to be advantageous for object-based classification in general. We conclude that broadband red-edge information derived from conventional multispectral satellite data has the potential to improve space-based crop monitoring. Because the positive or negative effects of texture features for object-based crop classification could barely be interpreted, the relationships between the textual properties and paddy rice crop parameters at the field scale should be further examined in depth.",

            "abstract": "The study of naturally occurring isotopic variations of rare earth elements (REE) has a potentially significant influence in geochemical research fields with other traditional studies of REE. One of the key features of REE are their chemical similarities and gradual changes of ionic radius, which may make the isotopic variation of REE a potential tool to understand the mechanisms of isotopic fractionation in nature. Among the REE, geochemical and physicochemical features of Ce could be anomalous, because Ce could be present as the tetravalent (+IV) state as well as the common trivalent (+III) state of other REE. Since the oxidation state of Ce can change by reflecting the redox conditions of the environment, the measured differences in the degree of isotopic fractionation between Ce and other REE can provide unique information about the redox conditions.\nIn this study, we developed a new analytical method to determine the mass-dependent isotopic fractionations of Ce and Nd in geochemical samples. The reproducibility of the isotopic ratio measurements on 142Ce/140Ce, 146Nd/144Nd and 148Nd/144Nd were 0.08‰ (2SD, n=25), 0.06‰ (2SD, n=39) and 0.12‰ (2SD, n=39), respectively. The present technique was applied to determine the variations of the Ce and Nd isotopic ratios for five geochemical reference materials (igneous rocks, JB-1a and JA-2; sedimentary rocks, JMn-1, JCh-1 and JDo-1). The resulting ratios for two igneous rocks (JB-1a and JA-2) and two sedimentary rocks (JMn-1 and JCh-1) did not vary significantly among the samples, whereas the Ce and Nd isotope ratios for the carbonate samples (JDo-1) were significantly higher than those for igneous and sedimentary rock samples. The 1:1 simple correlation between δ142Ce and δ146Nd indicates that there were no significant difference in the degree of isotopic fractionation between the Ce and Nd. This suggests that the isotopic fractionation for Ce found in the JDo-1 could be induced by physicochemical processes without changing the oxidation status of Ce, since the redox-reaction can produce larger isotopic fractionation than the reactions without changing the oxidation state. The variations in the Ce and Nd isotope ratios for geochemical samples could provide new information concerning the physico-chemical processes of the sample formation.",

The TC tracks are mainly controlled by the atmospheric circulation such as the trade winds and the Westerlies as well as are influenced to move northward by the Beta effect. The TC tracks, which calculated with trajectory analysis, would thus correspond to the movement of TCs due to the atmospheric circulation. Comparing the result of the trajectory analysis from reanalysis data with the Best Track (BT) of TC in the present climate, the structure of the trajectory seems to be similar to the BT.\nHowever, here is a significant problem for the calculation of a trajectory in the reanalysis wind field because there are many rotation elements including TCs in the reanalysis data. We assume that a TC would move along the steering current and the rotations would not have a great influence on the direction of moving. We are designing a state-space model based on the trajectory analysis and put an adjustment parameter for the moving vector. Here, a simple track generation model is developed. This model has a possibility to gain the probability distributions of calculated TC tracks by fitting to the BT using data assimilation.\nThis work was conducted under the framework of the “Development of Basic Technology for Risk Information on Climate Change” supported by the SOUSEI Program of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology.",

            "abstract": "Denitrification, a microbial process in the nitrogen cycle, is a facultative respiratory pathway in which nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), nitric oxide (NO), and nitrous oxide (N2O), successively, are reduced to nitrogen gas (N2). This study explores the use of microbial analysis to evaluate the processes involved in nitrate attenuation in groundwater. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) is used to identify denitrifiers based only on their 16SrRNA gene sequences, and Real-Time PCR analysis is used to quantify nitrite reducing genes (nirK and nirS), this suggest that a new methods for detecting denitrification activity by comparing the gene dosage that has been detected by RT-PCR and the value of the δ15NNO3- and δ18ONO3-. This study focuses on a zone of significant NO3- attenuation occurring at underground dam catchment area in the karstic Ryukyu limestone aquifer, which is located southern part of Okinawa, Japan.\nAs a result of microbial analysis, the bacteria were detected at all observation points which have been reported to have denitrification ability. And it has been confirmed that the bacteria has a gene nirS which is related to denitrification. In addition, many bacteria related to denitrification have been extracted from suspended solids more than from groundwater in the aquifer. And, the correlation was high between nirK /nirS gene dosage that has been detected by RT-PCR and the value of the δ15N and δ18O; therefore, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of using Real-Time PCR analysis for providing insights into the processes affecting nitrate attenuation in ground water.",

            "abstract": "Direct push technologies have recently seen a broad development providing several tools for in situ parameterization of unconsolidated sediments. One of these techniques is the measurement of soil colors – a proxy information that reveals to soil/sediment properties. We introduce the direct push driven color logging tool (CLT) for real-time and depth-resolved investigation of soil colors within the visible spectrum. Until now, no routines exist on how to handle high-resolved (mm-scale) soil color data. To develop such a routine, we transform raw data (CIEXYZ) into soil color surrogates of selected color spaces (CIExyY, CIEL*a*b*, CIEL*c*h*, sRGB) and denoise small-scale natural variability by Haar and Daublet4 wavelet transformation, gathering interpretable color logs over depth. However, interpreting color log data as a single application remains challenging. Additional information, such as site-specific knowledge of the geological setting, is required to correlate soil color data to specific layers properties. Hence, we exemplary provide results from a joint interpretation of in situ-obtained soil color data and ‘state-of-the-art’ direct push based profiling tool data and discuss the benefit of additional data. The developed routine is capable of transferring the provided information obtained as colorimetric data into interpretable color surrogates. Soil color data proved to correlate with small-scale lithological/chemical changes (e.g., grain size, oxidative and reductive conditions), especially when combined with additional direct push vertical high resolution data (e.g., cone penetration testing and soil sampling). Thus, the technique allows enhanced profiling by means of providing another reproducible high-resolution parameter for analysis subsurface conditions. This opens potential new areas of application and new outputs for such data in site investigation. It is our intention to improve color measurements by means method of application and data interpretation, useful to characterize vadose layer/soil/sediment characteristics.",

            "abstract": "From the tectonic configurations, historical records of the island, and tsunami records in the surrounding areas, Taiwan is highly susceptible to tsunami hazard. However, there is no record of tsunami hazard in the past one hundred years, therefore study of tsunami was not scarce in Taiwan. Although historical records do show possible tsunami events, the records were too sparse and incomplete to confidently reconstruct the paleotsunami events. In the past few years, simulations based on possible tsunami-genic zones near Taiwan show that the island could be highly affected by the correctly directed tsunami. Nevertheless, there is no detail, scientific research of paleotsunami records yet in Taiwan.\nOur investigations in eastern Taiwan indicate that in eastern Taiwan, where the island is facing the Pacific Ocean, stretches of boulders were embedded in the soil horizons, which indicate very high energy evenets were present in a geologically quiescent time for developing soil horizons. Prelimary C-14 dating indicates the event layers were a bit younger than 280 +/- 30 BP on the 1030 +/- 30 BP wave-cut bench. Although the outcrops are currently on the sea cliff facing the ocean, investigations from aerial photos dating back to 20 years revealed that the sea cliff in the study area is retreating at 0.5~1 m/yr. This implies the event layer seen could be more than 100 m away from the shoreline at the time of event, which increases the likelihood of tsunami-origin event.\nFurther investigations are needed to further differentiate tsunami or typhoon origin of the event layers in eastern Taiwan. Re-evaluations of the tsunami risk, if the event layers are proven to be tsunami origin, will be needed for the western Pacific Ocean.",

            "abstract": "The Mekong Delta in Vietnam is expected to face challenges from various forms of climate-induced events. In addition, a growing population, which currently stands at 18.6 million people lives in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. Therefore, the Mekong Delta is the focus of international action for adaptation. However, many climate sensitive regions and communities are unprepared for climate-induced natural disasters due to mismatch in perception with their respective risks.\nThis study examines the vulnerability and appropriate adaptation in the Mekong Delta from both scientific and regional aspects. First, we show the change in coastal areas in Soc Trang province, comparing the past to the present images using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and satellite. We identify some vulnerable areas which derived from multiple factors due to coastal erosion, flooding, and sea level rise. Second, we present results of perception survey about climate change and the adaptation at community level in Ca Mau, Soc Trang, and An Giang Provinces, which were conducted in 2012 and 2014. While the findings suggest varying degrees of adaptation to seasonal flooding by raising the ground floors of their homes and repairing houses, their capacity to prepare for extreme flooding is limited in spite of the residents’ awareness of the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters. Third, we propose an erosion-resistant dyke reinforcement technique by mixing natural palm tree fiber and cement, both of which are locally available materials in the Mekong Delta. It is expected that adaptation with multiple protections in accordance to regional feature can work well for such coastal disasters.",

            "abstract": "During the last 20 years, our paleomagnetic group had investigated many lakes with the aim to know the behavior of the geomagnetic field during the Holocene. Lake sediments are the good presenters of the paleosecular variation (PSV) records. In this paper are presented materials from Lakes Aslikul (Russia, 54o 25' N, 54o 07' E), Svir (Belorussia, 54o 47' N; 26o 30' E), Naroch (Belorussia, 54o 51' N, 26o 51' E). Samples of lake floor sediments were collected using a piston corer designed and manufactured at the Kazan University as a prototype were used piston corer which had been designed and used by F. J. H. Mackereth. Three cores were collected from each Lake Aslikul and Svir and six cores from Lake Naroch. Cores length was between 3,5-6,5 meters. Sediments were subsampled into cubic nonmagnetic plastic boxes. Their magnetic susceptibilities were then measured using a MS2-B instrument, and their natural remanent magnetization (NRM) (module and direction) was measured using a JR-4 magnetometer. Based on this data were built generalized record for each parameter.\nWe compared the geomagnetic field variations recorded in our study with the records reported in the literature for the sediments in the different lakes. Our data have a good PSV records correlation with other data so we can obtain age of sediments according to PSV records. The dating of lakes sediments was also improved and further detailed by radiocarbon dating that gave the same results. Some characteristic features, the B and S minima and the Y and E maxima (cf. nomenclature of Thompson and Turner, 1982) are recognized. All peaks have a wide but complicated structure. Studied lakes compared to the other European records available, it can be concluded that the PSV master curves obtained in this study can be used to model Holocene geomagnetic variations.\nThe work is performed according to the Russian Government Program of Competitive Growth of Kazan Federal University also by RFBR research projects No. 14-05-00785– а.",

            "abstract": "The Miocene Torres del Paine intrusive complex (TPIC) in Patagonia is a spectacularly exposed example of a bimodal shallow crustal laccolith, made up of a sill complex and a subvertical feeder system. The TPIC was emplaced in a back-arc setting, but slightly older arc-related intrusive units in this area testify to an earlier shift from an arc to a backarc setting. The entire ~88 km3 main complex was emplaced over short time scales of 162 ± 11 ka between ~12.4 and 12.6 Ma, with mafic units from the feeder zone found to be older than mafic units from the sill complex1,2. We aim to assess whether successive pulses of mafic magmatism can tap different geochemical reservoirs in sheeted magmatic complexes emplaced on such short timescales.\nHf isotope compositions of individual zircons from mafic units from both the feeder zone and the sill complex were determined by solution MC-ICPMS. Zircons from all units have Hf isotope compositions that indicate a slightly enriched mantle source. Zircons from the mafic sill complex units have higher (more juvenile) initial εHf than zircons from feeder zone mafic units. The shift towards more depleted Hf isotope compositions in the sill complex units, which are younger, demonstrates the rapid input of new juvenile material into the source region between ~12.6 Ma and ~12.5 Ma. A similar shift is also seen in bulk rock Nd and Sr isotope data for related samples3.\nThe Hf isotope data demonstrate that significant variability in source geochemistry is possible for sheeted magmatic complexes built up on very short timescales. Analysis of zircons from a range of dikes and intrusive bodies external to the main Torres del Paine complex, with ages that span ~12–29 Ma, will provide a more complete picture in time and space of the geochemical evolution of this magmatic system as it switches between an arc and backarc setting.\n1Leuthold et al., 2012, EPSL, 325: 85–92\n2Michel et al., 2008, Geology, 36: 459–462\n3Leuthold et al., 2013, JPET, 54: 273–303",

            "abstract": "The imaging spectrometer VIRTIS onboard Rosetta (Coradini et al., 2007) acquires spectra in the range from the near-UV through the IR (0.25-5 micron). Infrared spectra are affected by thermal emission from the surface of the comet, so the measured radiance in that spectral region can be used to retrieve surface temperatures and spectral emissivities by means of temperature-retrieval algorithms (Tosi et al., 2014, Erard, 2014). The temperature of a surface, and in particular its variation with respect to illumination conditions, depends strongly on the thermal inertia of the materials composing this surface and the sub-surface, but also on the topography and small scale roughness. Theoretical codes computing surface and subsurface temperatures under a range of different assumptions on the composition, activity and physical status of the surface matter are used to reproduce the IR radiances observed, and the apparent/effective thermal inertia determined in this way is assumed to correspond to reality (Capria et al., 2014). The initial results obtained using the data acquired during the approach and pre-landing (July 2014-November 2014) first phases of the Rosetta mission will be presented.\nAuthors acknowledge the funding from Italian, German and French Space Agencies.\n",

We first propose two new methods to solve the basis vectors of the OS-coordinate, both of which avoid the spatial rotation proposed by Li et al.

Moreover, for the major drawback of the OS-coordinate, which is the convergence and the divergence of the grid-lines pointed out by Li et al. (2014), we revise their basis vectors and design a new general rotation parameter to create the new basis vectors of the OS-coordinate. The experimental results show that using these new basis vectors, we can improve the orthogonality of the 3-D coordinate surfaces of the OS-coordinate. More importantly, we can easily control the distance between the neighbour grid-lines, therefore alleviating the restriction of the time step in the OS-coordinate.

            "abstract": "In numerical modeling of long-range infrasound propagation in the atmosphere, the wind and temperature profiles are usually obtained as a result of matching atmospheric models to empirical data. The atmospheric models are classically obtained from operational numerical weather prediction centers (NOAA Global Forecast System or ECMWF Integrated Forecast system) as well as atmospheric climate reanalysis activities and thus, do not explicitly resolve atmospheric gravity waves (GWs). The GWs are generally too small to be represented in Global Circulation Models, and their effects on the resolved scales need to be parameterized in order to account for fine-scale atmospheric inhomogeneities (for length scales less than 100 km). In the present approach, the sound speed profiles are considered as random functions, obtained by superimposing a stochastic GW field on the ECMWF reanalysis ERA-Interim. The spectral domain is binned by a large number of monochromatic GWs, and the breaking of each GW is treated independently from the others. The wave equation is solved using a reduced-order model, starting from the classical normal mode technique. We focus on the asymptotic behavior of the transmitted waves in the weakly heterogeneous regime (for which the coupling between the wave and the medium is weak), with a fixed number of propagating modes that can be obtained by rearranging the eigenvalues by decreasing Sobol indices. The most important feature of the stochastic approach lies in the fact that the model order (i.e. the number of relevant eigenvalues) can be computed to satisfy a given statistical accuracy whatever the frequency. As the low-order model preserves the overall structure of waveforms under sufficiently small perturbations of the profile, it can be applied to sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification. The gain in CPU cost provided by the low-order model is essential for extracting statistical information from simulations. The statistics of a transmitted broadband pulse are computed by decomposing the original pulse into a sum of modal pulses that propagate with different phase speeds and can be described by a front pulse stabilization theory. The method is illustrated on two large-scale infrasound calibration experiments, that were conducted at the Sayarim Military Range, Israel, in 2009 and 2011.",

            "abstract": "This study focuses on the rheology and mineral reactions in a brittle-ductile shear zone within the Wyangala Batholith, SE Australia. In the shear zone, a coarse-grained two feldspar-quartz-biotite granite is transformed into a fine-grained quartz-muscovite mylonite.\nThe samples from shear zone margins display cataclasis of feldspar and crystal-plastic deformation of quartz. Quartz accommodates most of the deformation and is extensively recrystallized showing distinct crystallographic preferred orientations (CPO). Feldspar-to-muscovite, biotite-to-muscovite and albitization reactions occur locally at fracture and porphyroclast margins. However, the bulk rock composition shows very little change in respect to the wall rock composition.\nIn the shear zone centre, quartz occurs as large, weakly deformed porphyroclasts, in sizes similar to that in the wall rock, suggesting that it has undergone little deformation. Feldspars and biotite are almost completely reacted to muscovite, which is arranged in a fine grained interconnected network. Muscovite has accommodated most of the strain. Muscovite rich layers contain significant amounts of fine grained intermixed quartz with random CPO. XRF bulk rock analysis suggests a significant increase in SiO2 and depletion in NaO content compared with the wall rock composition.\nWe suggest that the high and low strain fabrics represent markedly different scenarios and cannot be interpreted as a simple sequential development with respect to strain. The large quartz clasts in the central parts of the shear zone have never undergone the structural development displayed by the low strain domain. We interpret that the fabrics in the shear zone centre have formed due to fluid influx probably along an initially brittle fracture where hydration reactions dramatically changed the rheological property of the rock. Subsequent ductile deformation focussed in the newly produced muscovite-quartz layers, thus original quartz grains did not recrystallize. In contrast, in the shear zone margins the amount of fluid and reactions was limited therefore deformation was taken up mainly by the relatively weak original igneous quartz.\nThe studied shear zone exemplifies the role of fluids and fluid-induced reactions on contrasting rheological behaviour at local scales.",

However, the speciation profile for solvent NMVOCs (i.e., which individual species make up these NMVOC emissions) is very uncertain, with different data sources showing significant differences. Because of differences in reactivity between individual VOCs, the differences in solvent NMVOC speciation have the potential to lead to significant differences in predicted ozone concentrations. Initial box model studies have shown that these speciation differences can lead to differences in ozone concentrations of up to 40 μg/m3 (20 ppb) under idealized conditions. Here we use the regional chemistry and circulation model WRF-CHEM, implemented for the European domain, to examine the sensitivity of predicted ozone to different NMVOC speciations applied to European solvent-sector emissions. These results will be used to evaluate if an investment in developing updated, detailed NMVOC speciations by source sector is necessary for an improved representation of ozone pollution in Europe.",

The balance between fossil carbon supply, and the sufficiency (size) and capability (technology, security) of candidate carbon stores is assessed. The timescale of carbon retention by the variety of proposed stores has potentially important consequences for future climates.

            "abstract": "Nitrate contamination in shallow groundwater is still one of the common problems in many countries. Because of its high solubility and anionic nature, nitrate can easily leach through soil and persist in groundwater for decades. High nitrate concentration has been suggested as a major cause of accelerated eutrophication, methemoglobinemia and gastric cancer. There are several factors influencing the fate of nitrate in groundwater system, which is e.g. distribution of N- sources to soil and groundwater, distribution and amount of reactive substances maintaining denitrification, rate of nitrate degradation and its kinetics, and geological characteristics of the aquifer. Nitrate transport and redox transformation processes are closely linked to complex and spatially distributed physical and chemical interaction, therefore it is difficult to predict and quantify in the field and laboratory experiment. Models can play a key role in elucidation of nitrate reduction pathway in groundwater system and in the design and evaluation of field tests to investigate in situ remediation technologies as well. The goal of the current study is to predict groundwater vulnerability to nitrate, to identify functional zones of denitrification in heterogeneous aquifer systems and to describe the uncertainty of the predictions due to scale effects. For this aim, we developed a kinetic model using multi-component mass transport code OpenGeoSys coupling with IPhreeqc module of the geochemical solver PHREEQC. The developed model included sequential aerobic and nitrate-based respiration, multi-Monod kinetics, multi-species biogeochemical reactions, and geological characteristics of the groundwater aquifer. Moreover water-rock interaction such as secondary mineral precipitation was also included in this model. In this presentation, we focused on the general modelling approach and present the simulation results of nitrate transport simulation in a hypothetical aquifer systems based on data from Hessian Ried, an important groundwater resource for the densely populated Rhine-Main region in Germany.",

            "abstract": "The degradation of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) releases chlorine, which is a major contributor to the destruction of stratospheric ozone. Recent studies of CFC-12 (CCl2F2) have reported strong chlorine and carbon isotope fractionations in stratospheric and tropospheric samples, respectively. The δ(37Cl) variations were attributed to isotope dependent sink reactions, similar to effects seen in nitrous oxide (N2O), whereas adjustments to manufacturing processes were used to explain the δ(13C) changes. Using air archives to measure chlorine and carbon isotope ratios in CFCs could help to identify and quantify their sources and sinks. We analyse the three most abundant CFCs and show that CFC-11 (CCl3F) and CFC-113 (CClF2CCl2F) exhibit significant chlorine isotope fractionation in the stratosphere, in common with CFC-12. We then use a 2-box model to estimate the expected tropospheric isotope signature of these gases, based on their emissions and transport history, as well as their measured stratospheric isotope fractionation constants (εapp). We also present long-term δ(37Cl) and δ(13C) trends of all three CFCs, determined from background tropospheric samples from the Cape Grim air archive (1978 – 2010) and firn air samples from the Arctic (NEEM, Greenland) and Antarctica (Fletcher Promontory). These measurements are compared to our model trends, leading to an evaluation of long-term chlorine and carbon isotope changes. This study also extends the novel approach to measuring trace gas isotope ratios in small air volumes, using a single-detector gas chromatography-mass spectrometry system.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies show that the vegetation canopy scale sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) can be observed from satellite. To understand how the canopy scale bidirectional fluorescence observations are related to three-dimensional fluorescence distribution within a plant canopy, it is necessary to evaluate canopy scale fluorescence emission using a detailed plant canopy radiative transfer model. In this study, we developed a three-dimensional plant canopy radiative transfer model that can simulate the bidirectional chlorophyll fluorescence radiance and show several preliminary results of fluorescence distribution at the tree level. To simulate the three dimensional variations in chlorophyll fluorescence from trees, we measured tree structures using a terrestrial LiDAR instrument. The measurements were conducted in Yokohama, Japan (35°22'49\" N 139°37'29\" E). Three Japanese cherry trees (Cerasus Speciosa) were chosen for our study (Figure 1). Leaf-level sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is also necessary as an input of radiative transfer model. To measure the leaf-level SIF, we used high spectral resolution spectroradiometer (HR 4000, Ocean Optics Inc. USA). The spectral resolution of this instrument is 0.05 nm (full width half maximum). The spectral range measured was 720 to 780 nm. From the spectral radiance measurements, we estimated SIF using the three band Fraunhofer Line Depth (3FLD) method. The effect of solar and view zenith angles, multiple scattering depends on many factors such as back ground reflectance, leaf reflectance transmittance and landscape structures. To understand how the SIF from both sparse and dense forest stands vary with sun and view angles and optical variables, it is necessary to conduct further sensitivity analysis. Radiative transfer simulation will help understand SIF emission at variety of forest canopy cases.",

The long-term wind velocity data at Poker Flat and Tromso was analyzed for 10 years of 1999~2008 to show daily and seasonal behaviors of mesospheric gravity waves and horizontal wind of the 12 and 24 hour components.\nObserved wind velocities having the 1~4 hour period components are analyzed as short-period gravity waves and those having harmonic components with periods of 48, 24, 12, and 8 hours are calculated every 30 minutes. The phase relation between 12 hour components of zonal wind and kinetic energy of gravity waves (GW-KE) shows that their phases are locked for more than 10 days. Such phase lock events are found in several years at both observation sites. We confirmed a phase lock phenomena at both Tromso and Poker Flat continued for about 20 days from November to December in 2000. However, between Tromso and Poker Flat, the phases of 12 hour component of GW-KE differed by 180 degrees.

EXCEED observed the Jupiter's northern pole, which is our main interest here, and the Io plasma torus continuously during January and April 2014. EXCEED detects auroral emission covering the H2 Lyman and Werner bands of Jupiter over 800—1480 Å wavelength range with ~1 Å resolution. The observed spectrum shows H2 self-absorption (<1150 Å) and hydrocarbon absorption (<1350 Å) as seen in previous observations. Using the latter hydrocarbon absorption, we analyze temporal variations of auroral electron energy and flux using a new hydrocarbon color ratio adopted for EXCEED's wavelength range. The integrated auroral main variability over the pole region can be explained simply by the rotation of Jupiter's main auroral oval with the planet. The auroral color ratio also varies with a lesser dependence on the planetary rotation phase. We found that the short-term enhancements of auroral intensity associated with and without solar wind dynamic pressure enhancements are mainly due to the electron number flux variation. This suggests enhancement of auroral activity connected with the inner magnetosphere as seen in the low-latitude expansion and bright emission seen in the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images taken simultaneously. We also compare with the HST spectra acquired during January 2014.",

Here satellite altimetry data, wind, surface heat fluxes and sea-surface temperatures (SST) are used to analyze the fluctuations of Kuroshio path (KP) along the continental slope of ECS. The dominant EOF explains 44% of the variance, and its spatial pattern is of one sign, but with a concentrated amplitude some 160 km northeast of Taiwan. At the inter-annual periods, KP is found to be best correlated with the PTO index of Chang and Oey [2012, J.Clim], less so with PDO and a Kuroshio transport index, and is poorly correlated with other climate indices. The KP significantly correlates with a wind stress curl dipole along the Kuroshio, as well as with a zonal gradient in surface heat fluxnortheast of Taiwan [Oey et al 2010, Ocean Dyn], both of which are characteristics of the PTO, but not PDO. Over the past 2 decades, the KP has an onshore trend. The shelf’s SST warms and cools in concert with the onshore and offshore paths of the Kuroshio, but the most prominent change occurs at a localized coastal zone immediately shoreward of the EOF’s largest amplitude northeast of Taiwan.",

            "abstract": "Many inferences of strike-slip faulting and distributed shear zones on Ganymede suggest that strike-slip tectonism may be important to the structural development of its surface and in the transition from dark to light (grooved) materials. To better understand the role of strike-slip tectonism in shaping Ganymede’s multifaceted surface, we identify and map key examples of strike-slip morphologies (en echelon structures, strike-slip duplexes, laterally offset pre-existing features, and possible strained craters) from Galileo and Voyager images. Here we present the current state of these global mapping efforts, with particular emphasis given to complex structures associated with grooved terrain (e.g. Nun Sulci) and terrains transitional from dark to light terrain (e.g. the boundary between Nippur Sulcus and Marius Regio). These results are being synthesized into a global database representing an inferred sense of shear for fractures on Ganymede. This, combined with existing observations of extensional features, is helping to narrow down the range of possible principal stress directions that could have acted at the regional or global scale to produce grooved terrain. Moreover, these data sets, combined with mechanical models of shear failure and global stress sources, are providing constraints for testing possible mechanisms for grooved terrain formation on Ganymede.",

            "abstract": "Fluvial megafans are ‘large’ fan-shaped bodies of sediment that form from lateral migrations of a river as it exits a topographic front of a mountain belt. The criterion of what differentiates megafans from alluvial fans is an artificial scale divide. The scale divide varies in the literature, with the most common being a 100-km apex-to-toe length. Alternative values as little of 30-km apex-to-toe length have been proposed, as well as alternative metrics like coverage area. The question remains how should we define megafans, and what metrics differentiate them from smaller alluvial fans? To answer these questions, we catalog the known megafans of the world into a geodatabase delineating size and extent of basins both upstream and downstream from the apex. Through remote sensing, elevation modeling and geomorphic mapping, we populated the database with morphometric measurements, qualitative descriptions and basin parameters. We utilize the geodatabase to test a variety of criteria differentiating megafans from alluvial fans. The analysis draws into question a single parameter for defining megafans.",

            "abstract": "Sea level variability along the Japanese coast on interannual to decadal timescale was investigated using eddy-resolving ocean reanalysis data. An Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis was performed to extract principal modes for the sea-level variability along the Japanese coast. The first mode that explains about 72% of the total sea-level variance exhibits a simultaneous sea-level change along the whole Japanese coast. In contrast, the second mode explaining about 11% of the total variance has a prominent dipole pattern along the south coast of Japan, whose bifurcation is located at the southern tip of the Kii Peninsula (between Kushimoto and Uragami). It was also shown that these two modes have a close relationship with changes in the Kuroshio-Kuroshio Extension (KE) system. Specifically, Kuroshio path fluctuations at the eastern flank of the Izu Ridge have a large impact on the EOF1 variability. Besides, former studies have pointed out that the latitudinal position of the Kuroshio around the Izu Ridge is closely related to the KE variability on interannual to decadal timescale. As a result, EOF1 is synchronized with the KE variability. In contrast, the EOF2 sea-level variability is sensitive to fluctuations of the Kuroshio path to the south of Kii Peninsula, implying that the EOF2 variability is understood as a response of the Kuroshio path variations south of Japan.",

            "abstract": "Two well-studied Cretaceous-Tertiary accretionary complexes, the Kodiak complex in Alaska and the Shimanto complex in Japan, were formed by subduction of a relatively young oceanic plate, and have similar lithologies characterized by thick terrigenous sediments with rare pelagic sediments. However, the occurrences of fault rock types and fluid-rock interaction patterns along major thrust zone differ significantly, instead of similar background temperatures (~250°C). In this presentation we compare two representative fault zones showing contrasting mineralogy and water-rock interaction patterns.\nUltrafine-grained black fault rocks (BFRs) comprise the principal slip zone of the Pasagshak Point Thrust of the Kodiak accretionary complex. The geochemistry of the BFRs is characterized by Li and Sr enrichment, Rb and Cs depletion, and a low 87Sr/86Sr ratio. These geochemical signatures are explained by fluid-rock interactions at >350°C, which result in preferential removal of Rb and Cs and formation of plagioclase under the presence of fluids with high Li and Sr concentrations and low 87Sr/86Sr ratios.\nIn contrast to the Pasagshak Point Thrust, the fault core of the Nobeoka Thrust in the Shimanto accretionary complex is mineralogically characterized by breakdown of plagioclase and enrichment in clay and carbonate minerals. Values of illite crystallinity expressed as a full width at half maximum of the illite (001) peak in clay-fraction XRD increase within fault zones, showing the absence of significant temperature rise.\nTemperatures of fault plane during fluid-rock interaction may affect the difference in mineralogical characters of the two fault zones. Further mineralogical and geochemical investigations are necessary to explore the nature of fluids and its role in faulting along seismogenic subduction plate boundaries.",

The pyrope components are much higher than those previously reported (e.g., Prp: up to 12.37 mol% by Parkinson, 2000). Two kinds of garnet porphyloblasts were used in this study; group (A): just porphyloblasts without matrices by the excavation along trenches and weathering of the whiteschist, and group (B): porphyroblasts included in the matrix of whiteschist (sample no. ZW42). 42 grains of garnet porphyloblasts were analyzed with a standard-less quantitative EDS system. Garnet porphyroblasts of both (A) and (B) groups show clear chemical zonations and have higher pyrope components at the rim. Large chemical variations were recognized at grain by grain.\nGroup (A) garnets, which are probably originated from the similar whiteschist as sample no. ZW42, are subhedral to euhedral crystals (5-35 mm across) and show strong chemical zonations of Mg and Fe from the core (Prp: 15-23, Alm: 64-70 mol%) to the rim (Prp: 39-68, Alm: 30-61 mol%). Large variation of pyrope components at the rims were identified among the grains analyzed. Group (A) garnets include chloritoid, Rt, and corundum at the core, and Rt, Chl, Ky, Zr, and monazite at the rim.\nIn whiteschist (sample no. ZW42), the matrix shows lepidobalstic texture and consists of Phe, Bt, Qtz, and Ky; similar to that by Parkinson (2000). The garnet porphyroblasts (group B) measure 4-15 mm across and show chemical zonations of Mg and Fe from the core (Prp: 21-25, Alm: 71-72 mol%) to the rim (Prp: 27-34, Alm: 66-72 mol%). These garnets include chloritoid, Qtz, Rt, Chl and Ap at the core, and Rt, Zrn, and monazite at the rim.\nThe examined Kulet garnets show large chemical variations, particularly about the pyrope components, and the difference in inclusion mineralogy, although the host rocks of both group garnets might be the similar whiteschist. The big question arising here is why such large chemical variations of garnet porphyloblasts were observed in the whiteschist with similar occurrences. One possible explanation is that the strong retrograde alteration in the matrix might have erased the difference in the bulk rock chemistries of the protoliths. Only porphyroblasts might have held the information about the protoliths.",

            "abstract": "The major ions composition of porewater extracted from core catchers collected along the ~450 m of the ICDP Dead Sea Deep core represents the chemical composition of the deepest parts of the terminal-hypersaline lakes that occupied the basin over the last 220 ka. Profiles of the conservative elements Br- and Mg2+ show that the deep brine underwent a steady long-term dilution during the time interval starting from the thick halite lithological section deposited at 123Kya (MIS 5e) and ending at the halite section deposited at <11Kya (MIS 1). The halite layers were deposited during extreme arid conditions during which lake level dropped dramatically and deep brine salinity rose substantially. The secular variation in Br- and Mg2+, the occurrences of major halite deposition events correlates extremely well with the 100Ky Milankovich cycle and the global benthic δ18O LR04 stack paleoclimate proxy (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005). The freshening of the lake between the two extreme arid events must have been accompanied by dramatic water level rise and the establishment of long term stratification of the water column. The dilution of the brine was also accompanied by increase in the Na/Cl ratio, indicative of halite dissolution, most likely from the salt diaper of Mt. Sedom, which at the high lake stand was in contact with the brine and therefore susceptible to dissolution. The halite dissolved during the high stand of the last interglacial supplied the Na and Cl for the precipitation of halite during the post-glacial extreme arid event. Freshening of the hypolimnion and rise in Na/Cl took place mostly through turbulent mixing between the epilimnion and the deep hypolimnic water. The turbulent mixing with fresher epilimnetic brine, dropped the density of the hypolimnion from 1.25 g•cm-3 at 123Kya (MIS 5e) to 1.18 g•cm-3 at 16Kya, suggesting that the density of the epilimnion was even lower. A sharp lake level drop sometime after 16Kya lead to salinity rise of the epilimnion which upon reaching ca. 1.18 g•cm-3 resulted in complete overturn and mixing of the water column as evident from a sudden increase in the hypolimnion’s Na+ and Cl- and a small drop in Br- and Mg2+. The cycle ended with additional drop in lake level, salinity increase reaching precipitation of a halite layer at <11Kya.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection redistributes energy by releasing magnetic energy into plasma kinetic energy - high speed bulk flows, heating, and particle acceleration. In the magnetotail, most of the released energy appears to go into ion heating. However, previous observations and simulations show that this heating is anisotropic with the plasma temperature parallel to the magnetic field generally increasing more than the perpendicular temperature. Simulations and theory indicate that this temperature anisotropy can balance part of the magnetic tension force that accelerates the jet, and may even exceed it leading to firehose instability.\nHere we report the results of a new study of ion temperature anisotropy in reconnection exhausts generated by anti-parallel reconnection. We have examined ARTEMIS dual-spacecraft observations of long-duration magnetotail exhausts at lunar distances in conjunction with Particle-In-Cell simulations. In particular, we have studied spatial variations in the ion temperature anisotropy across the outflows far away (>100 ion inertial lengths) from the X-line. A consistent pattern is found in both the spacecraft data and the simulations: whilst the total temperature profile across the exhaust is flat, near the exhaust boundaries the parallel temperature dominates. A consequence of this is that firehose threshold is greatly exceeded in a significant fraction of the exhaust. In contrast, the perpendicular temperature dominates at the neutral plane (|BX| < 0.1 B0), indicating that, despite the turbulence and the large distance to the X-line, particles undergo Speiser-like motion (rather than isotropization by scattering). We also analyse the characteristics of the particle distributions leading to these anisotropies at different distances from the mid-plane.",

A previous study has characterized nitrate concentrations in groundwater in this area is a higher than the upper value (44mgL−1) of environmental quality criteria on one hands. On the other hand, there exists points where the concentration of nitric acid is not detected, which suggests the possibility of denitrification. During early 2000, a new analytical procedure for nitrate isotopic measurement, termed the “denitrifier method”, was established. With the development of the nitrate isotope tracer method, much research has been reported detailing sources of groundwater nitrate and denitrification mechanisms. This study presents a pilot case study (in the southern part of Okinawa Main Island, Japan, where Ryukyu limestone is extensively distributed) using the combined stable isotope ratios of major elements (C, N and S) as net recorders of the biogeochemical reactions with the aim of elucidation of denitrification mechanism in Ryukyu limestone aquifer.\nAs a result, significant decreases in nitrate concentrations due to denitrification were observed in groundwater at some locations, which induced increases in isotope ratios up to 59.7‰ for δ15NNO3. These points of groundwater were located above the cutoff wall of the underground dam and near the fault. It is considered that the residence time of the groundwater is longer than the other points at these denitrification points, and that reduction condition tends to be formed in the groundwater. However, the rapid rise of the groundwater level due to rainfall is likely to occur in the Ryukyu limestone aquifer, where the ground water was found to have changed dynamically from the reduction condition to the oxidation condition which a denitrification (has not occured)does not occur. Moreover, the occurrence of autotrophic denitrification was suggested by the δ15NNO3，δ13CDIC，and δ34SSO4 values in Ryukyu limestone aquifer.",

            "abstract": "The Sun is an almost perfect sphere. Its oblateness is about 10-5 of its radius. Its knowledge can provide strong constraints on solar interior models. The shape of the Sun is depending on the gravitational potential produced by the internal distribution of mass and on centrifugal forces due to the solar rotation. However, due to its very small value, the solar oblateness is very difficult to measure and its determination requires a very good understanding of any possible instrumental effect. Optical effects may distort the image on the CCD and it is not possible to detect the very small difference between the polar and the equatorial radius in a single image. In order to overcome this problem, a distortion mode is implemented. It consists in rotating the satellite by equal angle steps. Once the images have been corrected to all known effects, it is possible to compute the mean solar radius versus the angle on the solar disk averaged over all satellite positions and to fit the results by a sine function to determine the oblateness.\nWhen analysing the solar radius versus angle data, we observe an anticorrelation between the limb brightness and the radius determined from the inflection point. The apparent radius is smaller if an active region is near the limb. The bright active regions are confined to low latitudes and never occur at the poles, which may cause an artefact in the determination of the solar oblateness leading to a negative bias. We developed a new method based on a correction of the solar radius for a given solar angle according to the brightness of the limb at the inflection point and its derivative with radius. This method has been applied to several sequences of SODISM and HMI observations. It provides larger oblateness values than the one based on inflection point, ranging between 8.5 and 9.0 mas for both instruments, in good agreement with the theoretical predictions considering the rotation of the sun. It indicates that the classical method of the inflection point needs to be revisited to take into account the variability of the limb brightness for the determination the solar oblateness.",

            "abstract": "Methane is an important greenhouse gas that plays a critical role in climate variation. Although a variety of marine methane sources and sinks have been identified, key aspects of the fate of methane in the ocean remain poorly constrained. At cold seeps in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere, methane is introduced into the overlying water column via fluid escape from the seabed. We quantified the fate of methane in the water column overlying seafloor cold seeps, in a brine basin, and at several control sites. Our goals were to determine the factors that regulated methane consumption and assimilation and to explore how these controlling factors varied among and between sites. In particular, we examined the impact of nitrogen availability on methane oxidation and studied the ability of methane oxidizing bacteria to fix molecular nitrogen. Methane oxidation rates were highest in the methane rich bottom waters of natural hydrocabron seeps. At these sites, inorganic nitrogen addition stimulated methane oxidation in laboratory experiments. In vitro shipboard experiments revealed that rates of methane oxidation and nitrogen fixation were correlated strongly, suggesting that nitrogen fixation may have been mediated by methanotrophic bacteria. The highest rates of methane oxidation and nitrogen fixation were observed in the deepwater above at natural hydrocarbon seeps. Rates of methane oxidation were substantial along the chemocline of a brine basin but in these ammonium-rich brines, addition of inorganic nitrogen had little impact on methane oxidation suggesting that methanotrophy in these waters were not nitrogen limited. Control sites exhibited the lowest methane concentrations and methane oxidation rates but even these waters exhibited substantial potential for methane oxidation when methane and inorganic nitrogen concentrations were increased. Together, these data suggest that the availability of inorganic nitrogen plays a critical role in regulating methane oxidation in pelagic ocean waters. Some methanotrophs may obtain a competitive advantage in nitrogen-limited oceanic environments by fixing molecular nitrogen. The importance of such \"methano-diazotrophy\" on a global scale warrants further investigation.",

            "abstract": "Over the last years several 2D thermo-mechanical models of the Costa Rica - Nicaragua Subduction Zone (CNSZ) have studied the thermal distribution of sections of the fault. Such investigations allow us to understand temperature-related aspects of subduction zones, like volcanism and megathrust earthquake locations. However, certain features of the CNSZ limit the range of applicability of 2D models. In the CNSZ, geochemical trends and seismic anisotropy studies reveal a 3D mantle wedge flow that departs from the 2D corner flow. The origin of this flow are dip variations (20o to 25o between Nicaragua and Costa Rica) and the presence of a slab window in Panama that allows material to flow into the mantle wedge. Also, the Central America trench has abrupt variations in surface heat flux that contrasts with steady changes in plate age and convergence rate. These variations have been attributed to hydrothermal circulation (HC), which effectively removes heat from the oceanic crust.\nIn this project we analyze the thermal structure of the CNSZ. The objective is to study dehydration and metamorphic reactions, as well as the length of the megathrust seismogenic zone. We created 3D finite-element models that employ a dislocation creep rheology for the mantle wedge. Two aspects make our models different from previous studies: an up-to-date 3D slab geometry, and an implementation of HC by introducing a conductive proxy in the subducting aquifer, allowing us to model convective heat transport without the complex, high-Rayleigh number calculations. A 3D oceanic boundary condition that resembles the along-strike changes in surface heat flux is also employed. Results show a maximum mantle wedge flow rate of 4.69 cm/yr in the along-strike direction, representing more than 50% of the slab convergence rate. With respect to 2D models, analysis shows this flow changes temperatures by ~100 C in the mantle wedge near areas of strong slab curvature. Along the subducting interface, there is also a change of 10-40 C, which can have a significant impact on dehydration and metamorphic reactions. Also, 2D models have proven that HC controls temperatures along the subduction thrust, which controls the length of the seismogenic zone. In general, the combined effect of 3D mantle wedge flow and HC is expected to have a significant impact on the thermal structure.",

Sea ice coverage on sea surface strongly affects the climate of the Southern Hemisphere through its impacts on the energy and gas budget, on the atmospheric circulation, on the hydrological cycle, and on the biological productivity. In this study, we have conducted fundamental analyses of ice-rafted debris (IRD) and diatom assemblage to reveal a rapid change of sea ice distribution in the glacial southern Indian Ocean. Piston cores COR-1bPC and DCR-1PC were collected from the Conrad Rise and Del Caño Rise, Indian sector of the Southern Ocean. Age models of the cores were established by radiocarbon dating and oxygen isotope stratigraphy of planktic and benthic foraminifers. Records of IRD concentration suggest millennial-scale pulses of IRD delivery during the last glacial period. The depositions of rock-fragment IRD excluding volcanic glass and pumice were associated with increasing of sea-ice diatoms, suggesting that the millennial-scale events of cooling and sea-ice expansion were occurred in the southern Indian Ocean during the last glacial period. Provenance study of IRD grains suggest that the source of IRD in the southern Indian Ocean was mainly volcanic arc in the South Atlantic, based on chemical compositions of rock-fragment IRD grains. Thus prominent IRD layers in the glacial Southern Ocean suggest episodes of sea ice expansion and cooling in the Indian sectors of the Southern Ocean.",

            "abstract": "Recently, six coral boulders were founded on Lanyu, Taiwan (Yoko et al., 2014). The highest elevation is higher than 5 meters above the sea level. Four out of six boulders were considered as transported by extremely high energy wave, such as tsunamis or storm surges. Boulders were found only on the northern coastal line which is facing the Ryukyu trench. According to the radiometric dating result, the ages of the boulders are between ca.6000 years BP and ca.200 years BP. The youngest boulder was suggested to relate with the 1771 Yaeyama earthquake event (Yoko et al., 2014). In this study, we consider the boulders were transported by tsunami waves and look for the possible sources. On the other hand, if the possible sources are geologically unreasonable, we might have a chance to rule out the tsunami mechanism and focus the future studies on the storm surges. We implemented the Tsunami Reverse Tracing Method (TRTM) to find the possible tsunami sources, and perform the scenario analysis. In the TRTM, we place reverse tracing sources offshore the study area, and solve the linear shallow water equation by COMCOT (Cornell Multi-grid Coupled Tsunami Model) tsunami model. The result shows that four possible tsunami sources are identified. They are trench-type tsunami sources and coming from Ryukyu trench, Manila trench, Philippines trench and Yap trench. Detailed results of the scenario studies will be presented in the full paper.",

            "abstract": "Depth to basement estimation methods using various components of the spectral content of magnetic anomalies are in common use by geophysicists. Examples of these are the Tilt-Depth and SPI methods. These methods use simple models having the base of the magnetic body at infinity. Recent publications have shown that this ‘infinite depth’ assumption causes underestimation of the depth to the top of sources, especially in areas where the bottom of the magnetic layer is shallow, as would occur in high heat-flow regions. This error has been demonstrated in both model studies and using real data with seismic or well control. To overcome the limitation of infinite depth this contribution presents the mathematics for a finite depth contact body in the Tilt depth and SPI methods and applies it to the central Red Sea where the Curie isotherm and Moho are shallow. The difference in the depth estimation between the infinite and finite contacts is such a case is significant and can exceed 200%.",

            "abstract": "Clouds are a major factor influencing the global climate and its response to external forcing through their implications for the global hydrological cycle, and hence for the planetary radiative budget. Clouds also contribute to regional climates and their variability through, e.g., the changes they induce in regional precipitation patterns. There have been very few studies of decadal and longer-term changes in cloud cover in the tropics and sub-tropics, both over land and the ocean. In the tropics, there is great uncertainty regarding how global warming will affect cloud cover. Observational satellite data are too short to unambiguously discern any temporal trends in cloud cover.\nCorals generally live in well-mixed coastal regions and can often record environmental conditions of large areas of the upper ocean. This is particularly the case at low latitudes. Scleractinian corals are sessile, epibenthic fauna, and the type of environmental information recorded at the location where the coral has been living is dependent upon the species of coral considered and proxy index of interest. Skeletons of scleractinian corals are considered to provide among the best records of high-resolution (sub-annual) environmental variability in the tropical and sub-tropical oceans.\nZooxanthellate hermatypic corals in tropical and sub-tropical seas precipitate CaCO3 skeletons as they grow. This growth is made possible through the manufacture of CaCO3crystals, facilitated by the zooxanthellae. During the process of crystallization, the holobiont binds carbon of different isotopes into the crystals. Stable carbon isotope concentrations vary with a variety of environmental conditions. In the Caribbean, d13C in corals of the species Montastraea faveolata can be used as a proxy for changes in cloud cover. In this contribution, we will demonstrate that the stable isotope 13C varies concomitantly with cloud cover for the northeastern Caribbean region. Using this proxy we have been able to reconstruct cloud cover conditions back to the year 1760 and thus determine historical cloud cover prior to the recent use of instrumental records. We will also discuss how our coral proxy record of cloud cover compares to paleo-climate model runs for the same time period.",

This bottom-up approach is based on unsupervised training by field parameters, aqueous chemistry, and isotopes sampled from wells in crystalline bedrock, sedimentary, and alluvial aquifers. The neural connectivity is evaluated using a minimum spanning tree and then compared to component planes projections of weight vectors derived from the unsupervised self-organizing map (SOM) technique. The AutoCM spanning tree structure resembles the principal component analysis of the SOM component planes. Branch clusters at extremes of the trees represent strongly correlated variables diminishing father down a branch or among clusters with increasing separation. AutoCM appears promising as a rapid tool for understanding water-quality relations and may possibly be used in the model reduction process, but further testing is required.",

            "abstract": "Conversion of reservoir CH4 hydrate into CO2 hydrate is an interesting option offering a win-win combination of energy production with safe long-term storage of CO2 to minimize the CO2 footprint. As described theoretically and verified experimentally, CO2 is capable of inducing and maintaining a solid state exchange process of conversion. This mechanism will be slow since it is kinetically controlled by solid state mass transport through the hydrate. In parallel to this, the injected CO2 will form new hydrate from free water trapped in pores. Heat released by this process will contribute to dissociation of in situ CH4 hydrate and thus provide a second conversion mechanism with its rate controlled by liquid state transport processes. Understanding the kinetics of gas hydrate formation and dissociation is crucial for the development of theoretical models describing gas exchange processes and providing a basis for efficient design of production schemes.\nIn this work, we combine a non-equilibrium description of hydrate and fluid thermodynamics with the phase field theory (PFT) for simulation of phase transition kinetics. The phase field theory approach allows one to minimize the free energy while taking into account the implicit couplings to mass and heat transport as well as hydrodynamics. The hydrodynamic treatment is important to distinguish between situations when gas released in the course of dissociation will dissolve into surrounding water (slow dissociation), and more rapid dissociation creating dispersed gas bubbles that will affect the available dissociation interface and influence heat transport. We studied the conversion of CH4 hydrate into either CO2 hydrate or mixed CO2-CH4 hydrate to investigate the relative impact of the two mechanisms. The efficiency of mechanism based on formation of new CO2 hydrate will depend on the contact area between injected CO2 and liquid water. We have therefore investigated three CH4 hydrate systems surrounded by varying amounts of initial liquid water. It was found that the kinetic rate of conversion increased with the thickness of initial free water phases.",

            "abstract": "The 2011 Mw9 Tohoku earthquake has been recorded with a vast GPS and seismic network given unprecedented chance to seismologists to unveil complex rupture processes in a mega-thrust event. In fact more than one thousand near field strong-motion stations across Japan (K-Net and Kik-Net) revealed complex ground motion patterns attributed to the source effects, allowing to capture detailed information of the rupture process.\nThe seismic stations surrounding the Miyagi regions (MYGH013) show two clear distinct waveforms separated by 40 seconds. This observation is consistent with the kinematic source model obtained from the inversion of strong motion data performed by Lee’s et al (2011). In this model two rupture fronts separated by 40 seconds emanate close to the hypocenter and propagate towards the trench. This feature is clearly observed by stacking the slip-rate snapshots on fault points aligned in the EW direction passing through the hypocenter (Gabriel et al, 2012), suggesting slip reactivation during the main event. A repeating slip on large earthquakes may occur due to frictional melting and thermal fluid pressurization effects. Kanamori & Heaton (2002) argued that during faulting of large earthquakes the temperature rises high enough creating melting and further reduction of friction coefficient.\nWe created a 3D dynamic rupture model to reproduce this slip reactivation pattern using SPECFEM3D (Galvez et al, 2014) based on a slip-weakening friction with sudden two sequential stress drops . Our model starts like a M7-8 earthquake breaking dimly the trench, then after 40 seconds a second rupture emerges close to the trench producing additional slip capable to fully break the trench and transforming the earthquake into a megathrust event. The resulting sea floor displacements are in agreement with 1Hz GPS displacements (GEONET).\nThe seismograms agree roughly with seismic records along the coast of Japan.The simulated sea floor displacement reaches 8-10 meters of up-lift close to the trench, which may be the cause of such a devastating tsunami followed by the Tohoku earthquake. To investigate the impact of such a huge up-lift, we ran tsunami simulations with the slip reactivation model using sam(oa)2 (O. Meister et al., 2012), a state-of-the-art Finite-Volume framework to simulate the resulting tsunami waves.",

The lidar system consists of the Mie and Raman lidars for tropospheric aerosol, water vapor and cirrus cloud measurements, the Rayleigh lidar for stratospheric and mesospheric temperature measurements and the Resonance lidar for metallic species such as Na, Fe, Ca ion measurements and temperature measurements in the mesopause region. The lidar observations started from 2004, and routine observations of clouds and aerosol in the troposphere and stratosphere are continued now.\nWe have installed DIAL (differential absorption lidar) system for high-resolution measurements of vertical ozone profiles in the equatorial tropopause region over Kototabang. There were many ozone DIAL systems in the world, but their systems are almost optimized for stratospheric ozone layer measurement or tropospheric ozone measurement. Because of deep ozone absorption in the UV region, the wavelength selection is important. Over the equatorial region, the tropopause height is almost 17km. So we use 305nm for on-line and 355nm for off-line using second harmonics of dye laser and third harmonics of Nd:YAG laser.\nWe have observed large ozone enhancement in the upper troposphere, altitude of 13-17km in June 2014, concurring with a zonal wind oscillation associated with the equatorial Kelvin wave around the tropopause[1] at equatorial region.\n",

            "abstract": "The 2011 M9 Tohoku earthquake ruptured a fault area with length and width of ~500 km and ~200 km, respectively, and elastically deformed broad lithospheric and mantle regions. In order to evaluate the influence of the Tohoku earthquake on lithospheric stresses throughout Japan, an accurate accounting of coseismic slip is very important as the initial condition. We investigate the effects of heterogeneous elastic moduli under Japan on the inversion for coseismic slip, utilizing the land-based Japan GPS network as well as seafloor geodetic constraints near the trench. For this purpose, we construct a 3-D finite element model (FEM) to generate Green’s functions that allows considering the influence of complex slab geometry as well as heterogeneities in elastic structure. Our FEM incorporates the Pacific and Philippine sea slabs by interpolating seismicity for the Tohoku region and the Nankai trough, as well as the Kuril, Ryukyu and Izu-Bonin arcs. As fault source geometry, we consider not only the Pacific but also the Phillipine sea slab, with initial results suggesting that slip occurring beyond the triple junction is ~1 m. As for elastic heterogeneity, we investigated the effect of the crust-mantle stratification, the contrast of oceanic and continental crust, and the effects of slabs. Results indicate that crust-mantle stratification has to be considered to obtain an appropriate coseismic slip distribution; heterogeneous models show smaller maximum slip and a wider distribution compared to homogeneous structure. This confirms some earlier work, but is in contrast to some recent suggestions. The effect of the ocean-continent contrast and deep slab heterogeneity appear negligible for co-seismic inversions.",

In order to examine effect of typhoon on change in air-sea CO2 exchange, we selected several cases which typhoon approached to Korean peninsula in the summertime and their tracks are similar to each other. Also, we analyzed difference between CO2 flux along typhoon tracks and other adjacent region not to be directly affected by typhoon in these cases.\nThere is a difference in ocean fluxes around 15 gC/m²yr over strong typhoon areas compared to other areas. This difference varied with the wind speeds, the correlation coefficient between the ocean and the wind flux was found 0.7.

            "abstract": "Teleseismic receiver function method is an important technique to produce high-resolution images of deep earth structure. The Common Conversion Point (CCP) Stacking method exploits the P and S waves relative arrival time to locate subsurfaces, assuming that the structure beneath a station is locally horizontal, which is a proper approximation of the earth structure in most cases. However, for strongly laterally varying structure, the assumption can lead to artifacts in imaging. Nowadays, as more and more dense seismic array data become available, we can apply some exploration seismology techniques to image the deep earth structure. In this study we developed and tested several receiver function migration and imaging methods including the Kirchhoff wavefront migration (KM) technique and phase shift plus interpolation (PSPI) migration technique. Preliminary numerical tests show KM can correctly locate smoothly laterally varying subsurfaces. Artifacts appear if amplitudes of diffraction phase are large. For the PSPI migration method, we developed a new imaging condition scheme based on the adjoint operator theory. Updated results will be presented in the meeting.",

            "abstract": "Experimental studies have allowed great progress in our understanding of the mineralogy of the upper mantle and its melting behaviour. Whilst experiments provide excellent constraints on mineral and melt compositions at fixed P and T, they are inadequate for examining the continuous range of conditions and small melt fractions relevant to mantle melting. A thermodynamic approach may be used to interpolate between, and extrapolate, experimental conditions, particularly to inaccessible low melt fractions and subsolidus conditions.\nWe present a new thermodynamic model for the system NCFMASOCr, which allows phase relations in peridotite to be calculated up to 60 kbar. This model builds on the Holland and Powell (2011) dataset to include Fe3+ and Cr end-members in pyroxenes, garnet, spinel and melt. These additional components result in an increased stability of spinel and a broadening of the PT region where spinel and garnet coexist. All phase compositions are pressure-insensitive in subsolidus spinel-lherzolites, indicating that a suitable barometer for this lithology may not be found. A simple model has been developed for basaltic melts, presented in terms of 8 endmembers and calibrated from experimental data. Despite the simplifications of the melt model and system (K2O, TiO2 and volatiles are neglected), it reproduces other (non-calibration) experimental solidi, liquidi, melt productivity, mineral and melt compositions very well. The model is therefore a useful tool for exploring parameter space not yet examined or accessible by melting experiments. In particular, it is successful in predicting realistic nominal 0% melt fraction compositions, allowing the exploration of the fractional melting origin of basalt.\nThe inclusion of Fe3+ allows us to investigate the relationship between bulk Fe2O3, P, T and fO2, finding that fO2 and solid-melt Fe3+ partitioning is highly sensitive to mineral assemblage.\n(1) Holland TJB & Powell R (2011) J Metamorph Geol 29, 333–383.",

            "abstract": "We study temporal change of Earth’s inner core surface using earthquake doublets occurring between 1993 and 2013 in South Sandwich Islands. Inner core refracted (PKPdf) and reflected (PKiKP) compressional waves recorded at some seismic stations from several doublets show clear evidence for spatial migration of temporal change of the Earth’s inner core boundary beneath Africa. While PKiKP phases arrive earlier in 2003 as compared to 1993 indicating enlargement of the inner core surface beneath Africa (Wen, 2006), no discernible delays of the PKiKP phases are observed between the doublets in the later periods (with an exception for ARU station, where both the PKiKP and PKPdf arrived about 0.07 s later in the subsequent event for one doublet). On the other hand, the PKPdf phases are observed to arrive about 0.14 s later at some stations in the subsequent event of the doublets in the later time periods. Taking into consideration of the observations of Wen (2006), the Earth’s inner core radius has experienced different and rapid changes beneath middle Africa in the last 20 years. For some regions, it was enlarged in the early time periods and then remained unchanged later. For other regions, it changed little at first, then decreased, and became little changed afterward. Seismic evidence indicates that change of the inner core radius is episodic and migrates rapidly from one region to another.",

However, the Japanese observational databases (e.g., by a global network of radars, magnetometers, and optical sensors) have been maintained and made available to the community by each institution that conducted the observations. Then researchers encountered the problem that is difficult to look for various kinds of observational data to clarify the global scale physical phenomena. In order to solve the problem, the Japanese IUGONET project built the metadata database for upper atmosphere to cross-search their databases and integrated analysis tools. It became easy to find data and to derive many data to intermediate data by using above mentioned infrastructure. However, it is still difficult to reproduce the past research from the paper as only key because of lack of supplementary information.\n We introduce our activity to solve above mentioned problem especially about data publication which mints DOI and metadata to dataset by the Japanese local community relevant to upper atmospheric research field.

            "abstract": "Agricultural lands provide a tremendous opportunity to address challenges at the intersection of climate change, food and water security. Global demand for the major grain and seed crops is beginning to outstrip production, while population growth and the expansion of the global middle class have motivated calls for a doubling of food production by the middle of this century. This is occurring as yield gains for the major food crops have stagnated. At current rates of yield improvement this doubling will not be achieved.\nPlants have evolved to maximize the capture of radiation in the upper leaves, resulting in sub-optimal monoculture crop fields for maximizing productivity and other biogeophysical services. Using the world’s most important protein crop, soybean, as an example, we show that by applying numerical optimization to a micrometeorological crop canopy model that significant, simultaneous gains in water use, productivity and reflectivity are possible with no increased demand on resources.\nHere we apply the MLCan multi-layer canopy biophysical model, which vertically resolves the radiation and micro-environmental variations that stimulate biochemical and ecophysiological functions that govern canopy-atmosphere exchange processes. At each canopy level photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and energy balance are solved simultaneously for shaded and sunlit foliage. A multi-layer sub-surface model accounts for water availability as a function of root biomass distribution. MLCan runs at sub-hourly temporal resolution, allowing it to capture variability in CO2, water and energy exchange as a function of environmental variability.\nBy modifying total canopy leaf area, its vertical distribution, leaf angle, and shortwave radiation reflectivity, all traits available in most major crop germplasm collections, we show that increases in either productivity (7%), water use (13%) or albedo (34%) could be achieved with no detriment to the other objectives, under United States Corn Belt climate conditions.",

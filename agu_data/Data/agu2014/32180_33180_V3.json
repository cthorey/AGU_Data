            "abstract": "Rapid documentation (<1 day) of co-seismic surface rupture location and slip is essential for scientific and emergency response. We demonstrate how social media (text messaging and Twitter) and the emerging 3D data collection technique known as Structure from Motion (SfM), used in conjunction with traditional field reconnaissance, enabled us to rapidly locate and document surface ruptures from the Mw 6.0 South Napa earthquake. On the morning of the event, our field team used information available on social media to identify locations with potential surface rupture. Preliminary observations of surface rupture (measurements and geo-tagged photographs) were texted to the office-based team member who created digital maps of the rupture trace and shared them online via Twitter in near-real time. We documented many ephemeral features (such as offset roads, curbs, and driveways) along the rupture trace within 12 hours of the event, before these features were destroyed by road and infrastructure repair. We were able to return to most sites again within several days, allowing us to document continuing slip and create time-series datasets of offset features. After the collection and re-collection of data at selected sites, we made detailed measurements remotely using 3D models constructed with SfM. The ability to quantitatively project features into the fault plane using these models allows for accurate measurements of small features often difficult to observe and quantify in the field.\nTraditionally, even preliminary maps of rupture extent and offset magnitudes are not available for several days after an event because office-based processing and compilation is required. Because we were able to compile our data in real time, we distributed our results while they were still valuable for ongoing scientific response. Our work helped other science teams efficiently target fieldwork and instrument deployment; for example, one geodetic survey team used our surface rupture map to adjust their field deployment plans in an effort to capture rapidly-decaying postseismic movement. With social media and rapid, inexpensive data collection methods like SfM in mind, scientific response to future events has the potential to be more efficient and coordinated than ever before.",

            "abstract": "At least ten streams and several springs which were dry or nearly dry before the 2014 M6.0 South Napa earthquake started to flow after the earthquake. At the same time, two USGS stream gages in the Napa River and the Sonoma Creek registered coseismic increases in discharge and gage height. After the earthquake we made repeated field studies of seven of the emergent streams in Napa and Sonoma and one spring to measure discharge and to collect water samples, with the objective to test hypotheses about the origin of the new water. Here we report field observations, stream and spring discharge and the isotopic composition of the water in the emergent flow. The data allow us to conclude that the emergent streams and spring may have originated from groundwater in the surrounding mountains released by the earthquake.",

            "abstract": "<span\">The 2014 South Napa earthquake (Mw 6.1, GCMT) occurred near the American Canyon, California, at 3:20 on 24 August 2014. The earthquake is the largest damaging earthquakes in the area since the 1989 Mw 6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake. <span\">A large number of strong ground motions were recorded during this earthquake. We discuss the attenuation characteristics of the strong ground motions of the earthquake.\n<span\">The data used in this study are PGAs compiled by the Center for Engineering Strong Motion Data (CESMD), while the records derived at the stations located in a building were excluded. PGA is defined as the larger one among the PGAs of two horizontal components.  We use a source model derived based on the waveform inversion by Dreger (2014).  Based on the source model, we calculated the fault distance (FD) and the median distance (MED) which defined as the closest distance from a station to the middle line of the fault plane.  \nWe compared the observed PGAs with the GMPEs developed both in US (Boore et al., 2014) and Japan (Si and Midorikawa, 1999; Koketsu et al., 2013), as shown in Figure 1 (left, and center). The predictions by the GMPEs are generally consistent with the observations in near-field area, but overestimated at stations farther than about 10 km in fault distance. The reasons of the overestimates are assumed as follows: (1) the backward propagation effects since many far stations are located in bay area, (2) the energy loss when the seismic waves pass through the sharp discontinuities in the shear wave velocity structure. The second reason are taken into account for the case using MED based on the methods used in Si et al. (2012, 15WCEE). The corrected predictions are significantly improved (Figure 1, right).",

            "abstract": "The Napa earthquake recently occurred close to Silicon Valley. This makes it a good candidate to study what social networks, wearable objects and website traffic analysis (flashsourcing) can tell us about the way eyewitnesses react to ground shaking.\nIn the first part, we compare the ratio of people publishing tweets and with the ratio of people visiting EMSC (European Mediterranean Seismological Centre) real time information website in the first minutes following the earthquake occurrence to the results published by Jawbone, which show that the proportion of people waking up depends (naturally) on the epicentral distance. The key question to evaluate is whether the proportions of inhabitants tweeting or visiting the EMSC website are similar to the proportion of people waking up as shown by the Jawbone data. If so, this supports the premise that all methods provide a reliable image of the relative ratio of people waking up.\nThe second part of the study focuses on the reaction time for both Twitter and EMSC website access. We show, similarly to what was demonstrated for the Mineral, Virginia, earthquake (Bossu et al., 2014), that hit times on the EMSC website follow the propagation of the P waves and that 2 minutes of website traffic is sufficient to determine the epicentral location of an earthquake on the other side of the Atlantic. We also compare with the publication time of messages on Twitter. Finally, we check whether the number of tweets and the number of visitors relative to the number of inhabitants is correlated to the local level of shaking.\nTogether these results will tell us whether the reaction of eyewitnesses to ground shaking as observed through Twitter and the EMSC website analysis is tool specific (i.e. specific to Twitter or EMSC website) or whether they do reflect people’s actual reactions.",

            "abstract": "Assignment of the South Napa earthquake to a mapped fault is difficult, as it occurred where three large, northwest-trending faults converge and may interact in the subsurface. The surface rupture did not fall on the main trace of any of these faults, but instead between the Carneros and West Napa faults and northwest along strike from the northern mapped end of the Franklin Fault. The 2014 rupture plane appears to be nearly vertical, based on focal mechanisms of the mainshock and connection of the surface trace/rupture to the relocated hypocenter (J. Hardebeck, USGS). 3D surfaces constructed from published data show that the Carneros Fault is a steeply west-dipping fault that runs just west of the near-vertical 2014 rupture plane. The Carneros Fault does not appear to have been involved in the earthquake, although relocated aftershocks suggest possible minor triggered slip. The main West Napa Fault is also steeply west-dipping and that its projection intersects the 2014 rupture plane at around the depth of the mainshock hypocenter. UAVSAR data (A. Donnellan, JPL) and relocated aftershocks suggest that the main West Napa Fault experienced triggered slip/afterslip along a length of roughly 20 km. It is possible that the 2014 rupture took place along a largely unrecognized westerly strand of the West Napa Fault. The Franklin Fault is a steeply east-dipping fault (with a steeply west-dipping subordinate trace east of Mare Island) that has documented late Quaternary offset. Given the generally aligned orientation of the 3D fault surfaces, an alternative interpretation is that the South Napa earthquake occurred on the northernmost reach of the Franklin Fault within it's 3D junction with the West Napa Fault. This interpretation is supported, but not proven, by a short but prominent linear feature in the UAVSAR data at Slaughterhouse Point west of Vallejo, along trend south-southeast of the observed coseismic surface rupture.",

            "abstract": "Potential-field data indicate that the M6.0 South Napa earthquake and its aftershocks were influenced by complex structure among the West Napa-Carneros-Pinole-Franklin faults system. The West Napa and Carneros faults, although considered to be minor Quaternary players within the San Andreas fault system, are major faults that in part bound the Mayacamas Mountains, an uplifted block of Mesozoic basement between Sonoma and Napa Valleys, and that produce prominent potential-field gradients. These two faults may account for as much as 30-50 km of right-lateral offset since ~6 Ma based on offset magnetic anomalies, length of pull-apart basins, and correlation of Neogene units. Uplift of the block may be Quaternary in age because gravels found to the west of the range contain clasts of 2.8 Ma obsidian derived from the east of the range. The southern extent of the South Napa earthquake rupture and seismicity is bounded on the west by the north end of a pull-apart basin between the Carneros and Pinole faults reflected in gravity data. The prominent gravity and magnetic gradients associated with the West Napa fault weaken where mapped traces of the fault begin to splay at the southern extent of Mesozoic and Paleogene outcrops. This region also encompasses multiple linear north-northwest-trending features identified in UAVSAR and is where the Carneros and West Napa faults are closest at the surface. We suggest that the interaction of these two faults not only affects the South Napa earthquake, but also influenced the extent of seismicity following the 2000 Yountville earthquake as well as the diffuse zone of seismicity generally confined between these two faults as they curve northwestward towards the southern end of the Maacama fault. Damage produced by the South Napa and Yountville earthquakes may have been focused by the 2-3 km-deep basin beneath the city of Napa, concentrated not over the deepest parts of the basin, but rather along the periphery or over an intra-basin arch. Red-tagged buildings from the South Napa event are located over a slight arch where magnetic anomalies attributed to the Sonoma Volcanics appear to diminish, suggesting a thicker sedimentary fill overlies the volcanic rocks in the arch. Red-tagged buildings from the Yountville event are also located over the arch and over the western and eastern basin margins.",

            "abstract": "Pre-earthquake airborne LiDAR coverage exists for the area impacted by the M 6.0 South Napa earthquake. The Napa watershed data set was acquired in 2003, and data sets were acquired in other portions of the impacted area in 2007, 2010 and 2014. The pre-earthquake data are being assessed and are of variable quality and point density. Following the earthquake, a coalition was formed to enable rapid acquisition of post-earthquake LiDAR. Coordination of this coalition took place through the California Earthquake Clearinghouse; consequently, a commercial contract was organized by Department of Water Resources that allowed for the main fault rupture and damaged Browns Valley area to be covered 16 days after the earthquake at a density of 20 points per square meter over a 20 square kilometer area. Along with the airborne LiDAR, aerial imagery was acquired and will be processed to form an orthomosaic using the LiDAR-derived DEM. The ‘Phase I’ airborne data were acquired using an Optech Orion M300 scanner, an Applanix 200 GPS-IMU, and a DiMac ultralight medium format camera by Towill. These new data, once delivered, will be differenced against the pre-earthquake data sets using a newly developed algorithm for point cloud matching, which is improved over prior methods by accounting for scan geometry error sources. Proposed additional ‘Phase II’ coverage would allow repeat-pass, post-earthquake coverage of the same area of interest as in Phase I, as well as an addition of up to 4,150 square kilometers that would potentially allow for differential LiDAR assessment of levee and bridge impacts at a greater distance from the earthquake source. Levee damage was reported up to 30 km away from the epicenter, and proposed LiDAR coverage would extend up to 50 km away and cover important critical lifeline infrastructure in the western Sacramento River delta, as well as providing full post-earthquake repeat-pass coverage of the Napa watershed to study transient deformation.",

            "abstract": "We analyze ambient seismic noise wavefield to explore temporal variations in seismic velocity associated with the 24 August 2014 Mw 6.0 South Napa earthquake. We estimate relative velocity changes (dv/v) with MSNoise [Lecocq et al., 2014, SRL] by analyzing continuous waveforms collected at 10 seismic stations that locate near the epicenter of the 2014 South Napa earthquake. Following Brenguier et al. [2008, Science], our preliminary analysis focuses on the vertical component waveforms in a frequency range of 0.1-0.9 Hz. We determine the reference Green’s function (GF) for each station pair as the average of 1-day stacks of GFs obtained in the time interval, January through July 2014. We estimate the time history of dv/v by measuring delay times between 10-day stacks of GF and reference GF. We find about 0.07% velocity reduction immediately after the 2014 South Napa earthquake by measuring the delay times between stacked and reference GFs. Our preliminary result also reveals a post-seismic relaxation process. The velocity reduction is down to 0.04% about 20 days after the 2014 South Napa earthquake. We have implemented an automated system to monitor the time history of dv/v (http://earthquakes.berkeley.edu/~taira/SNapa/SNapa_Noise.html) by using waveforms archived at the Northern California Earthquake Data Center. We will characterize the detailed temporal evolution of velocity change associated with the 2014 South Napa earthquake.",

            "abstract": "Currently earthquake prediction research methods can be divided into the crust change, radon concentration, well water level, animal behavior, Very high frequency (VHF) signals, GPS/TEC in ionospheric variations, thermal infrared radiation (TIR) anomalies. Before major earthquakes (M> 6) occurred, jet stream in the epicenter area will interrupt or velocity flow lines cross. That meaning is that before earthquake happen, atmospheric pressure in high altitude suddenly dropped during 6~12 hours (Wu & Tikhonov, 2014). This technique has been used to predict the strong earthquakes in real time, and then pre-registered on the website. For example: M6.0 Northern California earthquake on 2014/08/24(figure1) , M6.6 Russia earthquake on 2013/10/12(figure2), As far as 2014/08/24 M6.6 earthquake in CA, USA, the front end of the 60knots speed line was at the S.F. on 2014/06/16 12:00, and then after 69 days ,M6.1 earthquake happened. We predicted that magnitude is larger than 5.5 but the period is only 30 days on 2014/07/16 . The deviation of predicted point was about 70 km. Lithosphere-atmosphere-ionosphere (LAI) coupling model may be explained this phenomenon : Ionization of the air produced by an increased emanation of radon at epicenter. The water molecules in the air react with these ions, and then release heat. The heat result in temperature rise in the air. They are also accompanied by a large-scale change in the atmospheric pressure and jet streams morphology.We obtain satisfactory accuracy of estimation of the epicenter location. As well we define the short alarm period. That's the positive aspects of our forecast. However, estimates of magnitude jet contain a big uncertainty.\n",

            "abstract": "Medium size events like the M6.0 South Napa earthquake are very challenging for EEW: the damage such events produce can be severe, but it is generally confined to relatively small zones around the epicenter and the shaking duration is short. This leaves a very short window for timely EEW alerts. Algorithms that wait for several stations to trigger before sending out EEW alerts are typically not fast enough for these kind of events because their blind zone (the zone where strong ground motions start before the warnings arrive) typically covers all or most of the area that experiences strong ground motions. At the same time, single station algorithms are often too unreliable to provide useful alerts.\nThe filter bank EEW algorithm is a new algorithm that is designed to provide maximally accurate and precise earthquake parameter estimates with minimum data input, with the goal of producing reliable EEW alerts when only a very small number of stations have been reached by the p-wave. It combines the strengths of single station and network based algorithms in that it starts parameter estimates as soon as 0.5 seconds of data are available from the first station, but then perpetually incorporates additional data from the same or from any number of other stations. The algorithm analyzes the time dependent frequency content of real time waveforms with a filter bank. It then uses an extensive training data set to find earthquake records from the past that have had similar frequency content at a given time since the p-wave onset. The source parameters of the most similar events are used to parameterize a likelihood function for the source parameters of the ongoing event, which can then be maximized to find the most likely parameter estimates.\nOur preliminary results show that the filter bank EEW algorithm correctly estimated the magnitude of the South Napa earthquake to be ~M6 with only 1 second worth of data at the nearest station to the epicenter. This estimate is then confirmed when updates based on more data from stations at farther distances become available. Because these early estimates saturate at ~M6.5, however, the magnitude estimate might have had to be considered a minimum bound.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) is a trade-off between time and accuracy. We aim to increase the alerting time without loosing its reliability. This can be achieved by using prior information to classify a pick to be a true or false event, then issue alerts immediately after the first trigger. Since earthquakes cluster in time and location, potential aftershock occurrences can be predicted using the Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence Model (ETAS). We show that by applying the prior information provided by ETAS in the Bayesian updating process of EEW, we can significantly improve the alerting time. As an example, the epicenter estimation for the aftershock events from the M6.0 South Napa Earthquake is performed using ETAS to illustrate the accuracy of aftershock prediction. For instance, in an aftershock sequence, the most triggers at the closest stations will turn out to be real earthquake. As a result, during the aftershock sequence of the South Napa earthquake, warnings can be issued after observations of only one or two stations.",

            "abstract": "E-DECIDER initiated rapid response mode when the California Earthquake Clearinghouse was activated the morning following the M6 Napa earthquake. Data products, including: 1) rapid damage and loss estimates, 2) deformation magnitude and slope change maps, and 3) aftershock forecasts were provided to the Clearinghouse partners within 24 hours of the event via XchangeCore Web Service Data Orchestration sharing.\nNASA data products were provided to end-users via XchangeCore, EERI and Clearinghouse websites, and ArcGIS online for Napa response, reaching a wide response audience. The E-DECIDER team helped facilitate rapid delivery of NASA products to stakeholders and participated in Clearinghouse Napa earthquake briefings to update stakeholders on product information.\nRapid response products from E-DECIDER can be used to help prioritize response efforts shortly after the event has occurred. InLET (Internet Loss Estimation Tool) post-event damage and casualty estimates were generated quickly after the Napa earthquake. InLET provides immediate post-event estimates of casualties and building damage by performing loss/impact simulations using USGS ground motion data and FEMA HAZUS damage estimation technology. These results were provided to E-DECIDER by their collaborators, ImageCat, Inc. and the Community Stakeholder Network (CSN).\nStrain magnitude and slope change maps were automatically generated when the Napa earthquake appeared on the USGS feed. These maps provide an early estimate of where the deformation has occurred and where damage may be localized. Using E-DECIDER critical infrastructure overlays with damage estimates, decision makers can direct response effort that can be verified later with field reconnaissance and remote sensing-based observations.\nEarthquake aftershock forecast maps were produced within hours of the event. These maps highlight areas where aftershocks are likely to occur and can also be coupled with infrastructure overlays to help direct response efforts.\nThis experience has helped the E-DECIDER team validate many of the products that are currently served on the platform. Furthermore, based on lessons learned from this event, we are developing a research agenda that will help improve the delivery and use of our products to users in future events.",

            "abstract": "On August 24 2014 an Mw 6.0 earthquake struck south-southwest of the city of Napa, California. As part of the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory (BSL) Alarm Response a seismic moment tensor solution and preliminary finite-source model were estimated. The preliminary finite-source model used high quality three-component strong motion recordings, instrument corrected and integrated to displacement, from 8 stations of the BSL BK network for stations located between 30 to 200 km. The BSL focal mechanism (strike=155, dip=82, rake=-172), and a constant rise time and rupture velocity were assumed. The GIL7 plane-layered velocity model was used to compute Green’s functions using a frequency wave-number integration approach. The preliminary model from these stations indicates the rupture was unilateral to the NNW, and up dip with a average slip of 42 cm and peak slip of 102 cm. The total scalar moment was found to be 1.15*1025 dyne cm giving a Mw 6.0.The strong directivity from the rupture likely leads to the observed elevated local strong ground motions and the extensive damage to buildings in Napa and surrounding residential areas. In this study we will reevaluate the seismic moment tensor of the mainshock and larger aftershocks, and incorporate local strong motion waveforms, GPS, and InSAR deformation data to better constrain the finite-source model. While the hypocenter and focal parameters used in the preliminary model are consistent with the mapped surface trace of the west Napa fault, the mapped surface slip lies approximately 2 km to the west. Furthermore there is a pronounced change in strike of the mapped surface offsets at the northern end. We will investigate the location of the fault model and the fit to the joint data set as well as examine the possibility of multi-segmented fault models to account for these apparently inconsistent observations.",

This poster will examine how this earthquake fits into the earthquake history of the Bay region, which has shown considerable variation in the rate of moderate (M 5.5-6.5) earthquakes. A number of models have been developed to explain these changes in moderate earthquake rates, including the Accelerating Moment Release model (e.g., Sykes and Jaumé, Nature, 1990; Bufe and Varnes, J. Geophys. Res., 1993) and the Stress Shadow model (e.g., Harris and Simpson, J. Geophys. Res., 1998). In addition, various groups have made projections of future earthquake activity in the San Francisco Bay region, including the Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities (Field et al., USGS OFR, 2008) and Bebbington et al. (PAGEOPH, 2010), utilizing different physical models for earthquake occurrence. In my poster I will compare and contrast these different views of seismicity in the Bay region and where the 2014 South Napa earthquake fits into them. In particular, I will explore what these different models imply for future moderate earthquake occurrence and hazards thereof.",

            "abstract": "Rapid assessment of medium to large events with finite source models at regional scales has traditionally been delayed by limitations in seismic-only monitoring systems. Broadband and short period sensors saturate and strong motion sensors are affected by baseline offsets. In practice, this means that strong motion data must be high pass filtered. This approximation breaks down as the earthquakes get larger since the long period band of the spectrum best characterizes these events. In contrast geodetic data record long period motions down to the coseismic offset. They are however less sensitive, with single-epoch noise levels of the order of 1cm. With data from 34 collocated GPS/strong motion stations around the South Napa earthquake, we demonstrate a seismogeodetic algorithm that produces broadband strong motion velocity and displacements. We further show that these data can be ingested into source modeling algorithms with minimal operator interaction. Through retrospective analysis off the South Napa data, we show that one can produce a full suite of models from rapid moment tensors to kinematic slip inversions. While displacement amplitudes are small, often below GPS noise levels, the seismogeodetic solution provides an objective constraint on the accelerometer integration. The rapid inversion to find shallow slip can provide an indication of surface rupture and indicate that enhanced response is likely for road repairs and such. We quantify the improvements and advantages to using 5Hz GPS over 1Hz data.There are over 600 real-time monitoring GPS stations in the western US maintained by several operators; the NASA-sponsored READI project aims to unify these into a network of networks for prototyping earthquake and tsunami warning systems. We argue that the results shown here demonstrate the need for full integration of geodetic networks into seismic monitoring systems and that with current deployed stations this is within reach. However, only a small number of seismic and GPS stations are collocated in the western US In abstracts by Haase et al. and Goldberg et al. we show that low-cost MEMS accelerometers can be used to upgrade existing real-time GPS stations to seismogeodetic capability; 17 stations in southern California have already been upgraded and similar upgrades in the Bay area are forthcoming.",

            "abstract": "Here we present analysis of co- and post-seismic deformation for the 24 August 2014 Napa Valley Earthquake derived from Sentinel-1A interferometry. We use these to derive the co-seismic slip distribution and map the evolution of post-seismic afterslip.\nThe 24 August 2014 Napa Valley earthquake was the first earthquake for which surface deformation was measured by Sentinel-1A, a new radar satellite launched by the European Space Agency on 3 April 2014, and operated by the European Commission’s Copernicus program. Sentinel-1A reached its final operational orbit on 7 August, and fortuitously acquired a pre-earthquake image of the San Francisco Bay area on that day in StripMap mode. By comparing it with an image acquired on 31 August, we formed a co-seismic interferogram, which reveals the surface deformation that occurred during the earthquake and the first 7 days of the post-seismic period. We use this to constrain a simple elastic model of the co-seismic slip distribution; preliminary inversion results show that the slip at depth reached a peak of >1.5 m at a depth of ~4 km.\nFollowing the earthquake, Sentinel-1A has acquired further acquisitions in both StripMap and Interferometric Wide Swath modes. The first 12-day post-seismic StripMap interferogram shows a sharp discontinuity along the entire fault rupture, consistent with field observations of rapid afterslip. We will use the full time series from August to December to measure the spatio-temporal behaviour of the afterslip, and discuss the implications for the frictional properties of the fault.\nThe results from Napa point to an exciting and impactful future for the Sentinel-1 radar constellation. By mid-2014, Sentinel-1A will be acquiring data systematically over all the seismic belts, and the launch of Sentinel-1B in 2016 will increase the temporal frequency of acquisitions. The data will be available free of charge and will transform our ability to conduct tectonic geodesy, particularly in remote areas of the planet or developing countries unable to afford dense ground-based GNSS networks.",

The California Geological Survey, which serves as the permanent, lead coordination organization for the Clearinghouse, provided all coordination with the state for all resources required for Clearinghouse activation. The Clearinghouse physical location, including mobile satellite communications truck, was opened at a Caltrans maintenance facility located at 3161 Jefferson Street, in Napa. This location remained active through August 26, 2014, during which time it drew the participation of over 100 experts from more than 40 different organizations, and over 1730 remote visitors via the Virtual Clearinghouse and online data compilation map. The Clearinghouse conducted three briefing calls each day with the State Operations Center (SOC) and Clearinghouse partners, and also conducted nightly briefings, accessible to remote participants via webex, with field personnel. Data collected by field researchers was compiled into a map through the efforts of EERI and USGS volunteers in the Napa Clearinghouse. EERI personnel continued to provide updates to the compilation map over an extended period of time following de-activation of the Clearinghouse. In addition, EERI managed the Clearinghouse website. Two overflights were conducted, for reconnaissance on August 24, with a scientist and an engineer, and on August 25, to collect high resolution still-frame imagery. Following de-activation of the Clearinghouse, a multi-agency, state-federal, cost-sharing agreement was reached to acquire airborne LiDAR of the region affected by surface fault rupture.",

            "abstract": "The response to the 2014 m=6 Napa earthquake showcased data driven services and technologies that aided first responders and decision makers to quickly assess damage, estimate aftershock hazard, and efficiently allocate resources where where they were most needed. These tools have been developed from fundamental research as part of a broad collaboration -- facilitated in no small party by the California Earthquake Clearinghouse, between researchers, policy makers, and executive decision makers and practiced and honed during numerous disaster response exercises over the past several years. On 24 August 2014, and the weeks following the m=6 Napa event, it became evident that these technologies will play an important role in the response to natural (and other) disasters in the 21st century.\nGiven the continued rapid growth of computational capabilities, remote sensing technologies, and data gathering capacities -- including by unpiloted aerial vehicles (UAVs), it is reasonable to expect that both the volume and variety of data available during a response scenario will grow significantly in the decades to come. Inevitably, modern Data Science will be critical to effective disaster response in the 21st century. In this work, we discuss the roles that earthquake simulators, statistical seismicity models, and remote sensing technologies played in the the 2014 Napa earthquake response. We further discuss “Big Data” technologies and data models that facilitate the transformation of raw data into disseminable information and actionable products, and we outline a framework for the next generation of disaster response data infrastructure.",

Initial reconnaissance of the residential neighborhoods in the Browns Valley area in western Napa following the earthquake noted extensive zones of surface deformation, consisting of compression features including buckled sidewalks, curbs and pavement. Whereas some deformation was associated with surface faulting, much of the observed deformation consisted of these compressional features, which occurred away from surface faulting, could not be attributed to any particular faulting mechanism. One neighborhood with significant effects of surface faulting and well expressed compressive features was chosen for detailed mapping over a three day period, August 26 to 28, 2014. Specifically, compression and extension features along streets and sidewalks parallel to the fault trace and along cross streets roughly orthogonal to the fault trace were measured in detail. A summary of the observations and recordings, as well as the potential deformation mechanisms, are discussed.",

            "abstract": "The main rupture associated with the South Napa earthquake of Sept. 24, 2014 was ~15 km long from its epicenter (defined here as km 0, see figure below) to the surface rupture’s north end (~km 15). Near km 10 a maximum of ~0.45 m dextral slip was most likely entirely coseismic, because it showed the same amount of slip at 12 days post-earthquake (d-PE) as it did at 1.5 d-PE. However, farther south (km~6) by 1-2 d-PE conspicuous growth of offsets on cultural features indicated high rates of afterslip (~10-20 cm/day) had occurred. Although afterslip is gradually slowing, it is expected to continue for many months or possibly years. To closely monitor this rapid afterslip, we installed four 70-140-m-long alinement arrays across the main rupture (labeled NLAR-NLOD on figure below), measuring slip to millimeter accuracy. A fifth array that spans a northeastern branch rupture has shown no afterslip. We have run early observations (to 26-d-PE) of afterslip (coupled with accumulated total slip as measured on adjacent offset cultural features) in the program AFTER (Boatwright et al., 1989). This analysis allows us to make preliminary estimates of initial (1 d-PE), final or total accumulated event slip, and coseismic estimates (i.e., projecting slip toward a ~0.5-1 s rise time). Thus far modeled slip on all four arrays indicates that final values of total (coseismic plus post-seismic) slip might be approaching the maximum coseismic slip as a limit (~0.4 ± 0.1 m). The final values of total surface slip may thus become more uniform along the fault over time as compared to modeled heterogeneous seismic slip at depth. The timing of the surface slip release differs strikingly from south to north along the 2014 rupture; AFTER models suggest that slip south of the location of maximum slip (km 0-10) appears to have been dominantly postseismic (~50-100%), whereas north of the maximum slip (km 10-15) slip was mainly coseismic (~50-100%). The current AFTER model predicts that as surface slip along the fault approaches final values of total slip associated with this earthquake (e.g., ≥1000 d-PE), the respective contributions to the total event surface slip integrated along the entire fault will approach being 27% coseismic slip and 73% postseismic slip.\n . . .",

            "abstract": "The 24 August 2014 M=6.0 South Napa earthquake had strike-slip surface deformation extending over some 15 km with a maximum offset of 46 cm. The San Andreas fault (SAF) system in this region is relatively simple, the deformation zone is about 100 km wide and is bounded by the rigid Pacific Plate and the rigid Sierra-Nevada Plate. The deformation in this zone has some 33 mm/yr of right lateral strike-slip motion, some 20 mm/yr of this motion is accommodated on the SAF. There are a number of other right-lateral strike-slip faults in this zone. The South Napa Earthquake occurred on a branch of one of these, the West Napa Fault. The deformation zone has high heat flow indicating a thin lithosphere. This thin lithosphere is attributed to the recent subduction of the Farallon Plate beneath the Sierra-Nevada Plate. This subduction left a gap known as a slab window. Extensive GPS observations are available in the deformation zone, these data are well approximated by a near uniform shear strain between the two rigid boundary plates. We suggest that this near uniform surface shear can be attributed to viscoplastic deformation of the lower crust in the slab window. The thin brittle upper crust responds to this deformation. Because of the geometrical incompatibilities between the orientation of the San Andreas Fault and the imposed deformation, the brittle upper crust is subjected to distributed internal deformation. The 2014 South Napa earthquake is an example of this deformation, the localized co-seismic deformation is redistributed over the slab window by viscoplastic deformation of the lower crust. ",

            "abstract": "The August 24, 2014 M6.0 earthquake generated peak ground motions in excess of 50%g and 50 cm/s in Napa Valley and also along strike to the south, and was recorded at 17 stations within 20 km of the finite fault plane, 115 stations within 50 km, and 246 within 100 km. We compare the densly recorded ground motions to existing ground motion prediction equations to understand both the spatial distribution of ground-motion amplitudes and also the relative source and attenuation terms from the earthquake. Using the ground-motion data as reported by ShakeMap, we examine the peak ground acceleration (PGA) and velocity, as well as the pseudo-spectral acceleration (PSA) at 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 seconds, adjusted empirically to a single site condition of 760 m/s. Overall, the ground motions on the north-south components are larger than those on the east-west, consistent with both the generally north-south strike of the fault and the rupture directivity. At the higher frequencies (PGA and PSA of 0.3 s), the close data are very consistent with the GMPEs, implying a median stress drop near 5 MPa. For the longer period data, the GMPEs under predict the data at close stations. At all frequencies, the distance attenuation seems to be stronger than the GMPEs would predict, which could either be a station coverage bias, given that most of the stations are to the south of the epicenter, or may indicate that the attenuation structure in the Napa and delta region is stronger than the average attenuation in California, on which the GMPEs were built. The spatial plot of the ground motion residuals is positive to the north, in both Napa and Sonoma Valley, consistent with both the directivity and basin effect. More interestingly, perhaps, is that there is strong ground motion to the south, as well, in the along-strike direction, particularly for PSA at 1.0s. These strongly positive residuals align along an older, quaternary fault structure associated with the Franklin or Southampton fault, potentially indicating a fault-zone guided wave.",

The latter is a measure of the aftershock productivity. We also give the rates of occurrence of aftershocks as a function of time after the main shock for several magnitude ranges. The fit of this data to Omori's law is discussed. We compare the results of our study of the South Napa earthquake with our previous study of the aftershock statistics of the 28 September, 2004, M = 6.0 Parkfield earthquake. Specifically we will discuss any difference that can be attributed to the large difference in recurrence intervals for the two earthquakes. We also present studies of the three dimensional distribution of aftershock locations as a function of time and their association with the surface rupture. Aftershocks at large distances from the rupture zone will be discussed particularly those in the Geysers geothermal area.",

We investigate this unusual sequence by identifying additional aftershocks that do not appear in the network catalog, relocating the combined aftershock catalog using waveform cross-correlation arrival times and double-difference techniques, and determining focal mechanisms for individual events and event clusters. Additional aftershocks are detected by applying a matched filter approach to the continuous seismic data at nearby stations, with the catalog earthquakes serving as the waveform templates. In tandem with new event detections, we measure precise differential arrival times between events, which we then use in double-difference event location. We detect about 4 times as many well-located aftershocks as in the network catalog. We relocate the events using double-difference in both a 1D and a 3D velocity model. Most of the aftershocks occur between 8 and 11 km depth, similar depth to the mainshock hypocenter and deeper than most of the slip imaged seismically and geodetically. The aftershocks form a diffuse NNW-trending structure, primarily to the north of the mainshock hypocenter and on the west side of the main surface rupture. Within this diffuse trend there are clusters of aftershocks, some suggesting a N-S strike, and some that appear to dip to the east or west. Preliminary single-event and composite focal mechanisms also imply N-S striking strike-slip structures. The mainshock hypocenter and many of the aftershocks occur near the intersection of a sharply defined NE-dipping seismicity structure and the probable location of the West Napa fault, suggesting that stress is concentrated at a fault junction at depth. While the mainshock occurred on the West Napa fault, the majority of the aftershocks occur on other structures in a complex deformation zone.",

            "abstract": "The M6.0 South Napa earthquake produced strong ground motions in the northern San Francisco Bay area. A total of 214 three-component uncorrected digital accelerograms were downloaded from the CESMD website and processed following the PEER standard procedure (Ancheta et al. 2014). Intense ground motions were recorded in the heavily damaged area of Napa with peak acceleration greater than 0.3 g. Pulse-like waveforms were observed in several of the velocity time series at the near-fault stations. Near-fault velocity time series were rotated into fault normal and fault parallel directions and then characterized as pulse-like or non pulse-like according to previous studies by Hayden et al. (2014), Shahi (2013), and Lu and Panagiotou (2014). The near-fault velocity time series at five stations contained pulses with periods within the expected range of 0.7 s to 2.0 s for soil sites (Bray et al. 2009). However, they also contained longer period pulses than the expected range.\nHigh-frequency spikes were recorded at Carquinez Bridge Geotechnical Array #1 (CBGA1) of approximately 1.0 g on the NS component. These spikes were in the S-wave portion and were consistently observed in the downhole arrays and several other sites along the same azimuth from the source. The spikes increase in amplitude both from the Hwy 37/Napa River East Geotechnical Array to CBGA1 and from a depth below 100 m to the surface. This suggests that the spikes could be a result of path effects and site amplification through the surficial soft soil deposits. However, these observations do not exclude the possibility of soil-structure interaction effects on the measured recordings.\nThe 5% damped pseudo-spectral accelerations (PSA) from the recorded ground motions compared well to those estimated from the recent NGA-West2 GMPEs. The exceptions are that PSA is under predicted from 1 to 3 seconds at several near fault records due to the velocity pulses and for short periods at Carquinez Bridge where the large high-frequency spikes in acceleration were recorded. The PSA of the recorded ground motions are compared to ASCE 7-10 design spectra and USGS uniform hazard spectra (UHS). The PSA exceeded the MCE spectra and the 2475-year UHS within the range of 1 to 2 s at two Napa stations, and short periods at CBGA1.",

            "abstract": "In 2002 and 2003, Seismic Warning Systems, Inc. installed first-generation QuakeGuardTM earthquake warning devices at all eight fire stations in Vallejo, CA. These devices are designed to detect the P-wave of an earthquake and initiate predetermined protective actions if the impending shaking is estimated at approximately Modifed Mercalli Intensity V or greater. At the Vallejo fire stations the devices were set up to sound an audio alert over the public address system and to command the equipment bay doors to open.\nIn August 2014, after more than 11 years of operating in the fire stations with no false alarms, the five units that were still in use triggered correctly on the MW 6.0 South Napa earthquake, less than 16 km away. The audio alert sounded in all five stations, providing fire fighters with 1.5 to 2.5 seconds of warning before the arrival of the S-wave, and the equipment bay doors opened in three of the stations. In one station the doors were disconnected from the QuakeGuard device, and another station lost power before the doors opened completely. These problems highlight just a small portion of the complexity associated with realizing actionable earthquake warnings. The issues experienced in this earthquake have already been addressed in subsequent QuakeGuard product generations, with downstream connection monitoring and backup power for critical systems.\nThe fact that the fire fighters in Vallejo were afforded even two seconds of warning at these epicentral distances results from the design of the QuakeGuard devices, which focuses on rapid false positive rejection and ground motion estimates. We discuss the performance of the ground motion estimation algorithms, with an emphasis on the accuracy and timeliness of the estimates at close epicentral distances.",

            "abstract": "Recently, progress has been made to demonstrate feasibility and benefits of including real-time GPS (rtGPS) in earthquake early warning and rapid response systems. While most concepts have yet to be integrated into operational environments, the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory is currently running an rtGPS based finite fault inversion scheme in true real-time, which is triggered by the seismic-based ShakeAlert system and then sends updated earthquake alerts to a test receiver. The Geodetic Alarm System (G-larmS) was online and responded to the 2014 Mw6.0 South Napa earthquake in California. We review G-larmS’ performance during this event and for 13 aftershocks, and we present rtGPS observations and real-time modeling results for the main shock. The first distributed slip model and a magnitude estimate of Mw5.5 were available 24 s after the event origin time, which could be reduced to 14 s after a bug fix (~8 s S-wave travel time, ~6 s data latency). The system continued to re-estimate the magnitude once every second: it increased to Mw5.9 3 s after the first alert and stabilized at Mw5.8 after 15 s. G-larmS' solutions for the subsequent small magnitude aftershocks demonstrate that Mw~6.0 is the current limit for alert updates to contribute back to the seismic-based early warning system.",

            "abstract": "The source model of the 2014 South Napa earthquake (Mw6.0) is estimated using broad band strong ground motion simulation by the empirical Green’s function method (Irikura, 1986, Irikura et al., 1997). We used the CESMD strong motion data. Aftershock ground motion records of Mw3.6 which occurred at 05:33 on 24th August (PDT), are used as an empirical Green’s function. We refer to the finite source model by Dreger et al. (2014) for setting the geometry of the source fault plane and the rupture velocity. We assume a single rectangular strong motion generation area (e.g. Miyake et al., 2003; Asano and Iwata, 2012). The seismic moment ratio between the target and EGF events is fixed from the moment magnitudes. As only five station data are available for the aftershock records, the size of SMGA area, rupture starting point, and the rise time on the SMGA are determined by the trial and error.　Preliminary SMGA model is 6x6km2 and the rupture mainly propagates WNW and shallower directions. The SMGA size we obtained follows the empirical relationship of Mw and SMGA size for the inland crustal events (Irikura and Miyake, 2011). Waveform fittings are fairly well at the near source station NHC (Huichica creek) and 68150 (Napa Collage), where as the fitting is not good at the south-side stations, 68206 (Crockett - Carquinez Br. Geotech Array) and 68310 (Vallejo - Hwy 37/Napa River E Geo. Array). Particularly, we did not succeed in explaining the high PGA at the 68206 surface station. We will try to improve our SMGA model and will discuss the origin of the high PGA observed at that station.",

            "abstract": "The August 24, 2014, M­w 6.0 South Napa earthquake is the largest seismic event to have occurred in the San Francisco Bay Region, California, USA, since the Mw 6.9 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The event epicenter occurred at the South end of the Napa Valley, California, principally rupturing northwest along parts of the active West Napa fault zone. Bound by two major fault zones to the East and West (Calaveras and Rogers Creek, respectively), the Napa Valley is filled with up to 170 m. of alluvial deposits and is considered to be moderately to very highly susceptible to liquefaction and has the potential for violent shaking. While damage due to strong ground shaking was significant, remarkably little damage due to liquefaction or landslide induced ground deformations was observed. This may be due to recent drought in the region. Instead, the South Napa earthquake is the first to produce significant surface rupture in this area since the Mw 7.9 1906 San Andreas event, and the first in Northern California to rupture through a densely urbanized environment. Clear expressions of surface fault rupture extended approximately 12 - 15 km northward from the epicenter and approximately 1-2 km southeast with a significant impact to infrastructure, including roads, lifelines and residential structures. The National Science Foundation funded Geotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance (GEER) Association presents here its observations on the performance of structures affected by surface fault rupture, in a densely populated residential neighborhood located approximately 10 km north of the epicenter. Based on the detailed mapping of 27 residential structures, a preliminary assessment of the quantitative descriptions of damage shows certain characteristic interactions between surface fault rupture and the overlying infrastructure: 48% of concrete slabs cracked up to 8 cm wide, 19% of structures shifted up to 11 cm off of their foundation and 44% of foundations cracked up to 3 cm. Of particular interest is the performance of pier and grade beam foundations which behaved more stiffly in comparison to typically observed shallow strip footing foundations.",

            "abstract": "The 2014 South Napa earthquake was well recorded by a densely distributed strong-motion network. By using the automatic iterative deconvolution and stacking (IDS) method, we invert data of strong-motion networks with different apertures and station spacings for rupture processes, in order to examine the influences of networks on the rupture models. By performing a series of inversions, we have found that networks, with apertures more than 60 km and station spacings less than 10 km, are sufficient to imaging the rupture process of the South Napa earthquake. The automatically estimated rupture models of different networks are consistent with each other; all of them suggest that the ruptures mainly propagated to the north and to shallow depths, and formed a unilateral rupture event. The peak slip of this earthquake is about 0.5-0.7 m, located near the ground surface and about 5 km to the north of the epicenter.\nThis work suggests that, with the IDS method, it is feasible in principle to automatically estimate the earthquake rupture process after the earthquake occurrence. This would be beneficial to the earthquake emergency responses, such as earthquake relief and disaster mitigations.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the co-seismic surface deformation related to the earthquake occurred in Napa area (California) on August 24, 2014. To this aim, we exploit both the phase and the amplitude information of SAR data acquired in Stripmap mode by the Italian COSMO-SkyMed (CSK), the Canadian RADARSAT-2 (RS2), and the recently launched Europena Sentinel-1 satellites, to evaluate and analyze the induced surface displacements through the Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) and Pixel-Offset (PO) techniques. In particular, the SAR images, acquired from descending orbits on 26 July and 27 August 2014 by CSK, and on 07 August and 31 August 2014 by Sentinel-1, as well as the ones acquired on 24 July and 10 September by RS2 from ascending passes were used to generate differential SAR interferograms encompassing the main seismic events. The related deformation map, obtained by performing a complex multi-look operation resulting in a pixel size of about 30 m by 30 m, reveals two main lobes of LOS displacement with a range change decrease of about 11 cm to the NE sector and about 7 cm of range change increase to the SE sector. Moreover, by benefiting from the sensor spatial resolutions (down to 3 meters for both CSK and Sentinel-1 satellites), the Pixel-Offset maps of the same data pairs have been also computed, thus permitting us to retrieve displacement information along the azimuth direction and better describing the deformation field.\nIn order to retrieve the earthquake source location and its geometrical characteristics, the displacement maps were modeled by finite dislocation faults in an elastic and homogeneous half-space [Okada, 1985]. In particular, we searched for all the parameters free the fault by using a nonlinear inversion based on the Levenberg-Marquardt least-squares approach. The best fit solution, consists of a right –lateral NNW-SSE oriented fault. The comparison between the model results and the measured InSAR data show a good fit, with residue values smaller than 2 cm. However, small zones far from the epicenter area, with higher residues are individuated.",

            "abstract": "We explore how stress imparted from the 2014 Napa earthquake influences regional seismicity and thus hazard on the densely populated Bay Area faults nearby. We first calculate Coulomb stress change in the surrounding crust and on adjacent faults as identified by UCERF3 (Field et al., 2013) using the finite fault source model of Barnhart et al. (2014, v2). We then examine the seismic response to the stress transfer by comparing seismicity during the month after 24 August 2014 to the preceding 1.5 yr, for which seismic detection has been stable. There is a seismicity rate increase north of the mainshock, and a modest increase south of the mainshock, both sites roughly along the West Napa fault, where the stress is calculated to have increased by ~0.5 bar. A cluster of earthquakes was triggered at the center of the southern Concord-Green Valley (GV) fault where the stress is calculated to have increased by ~0.2 bar. The post-Napa seismic cluster on the Green Valley fault locates on the N-S (180°) striking trace rather than general trend of 160°, so perhaps by a combination of by its locally more favorable strike and its presumed low friction, since it is a creeping fault. The relationship between the Napa source and the triggered aftershock cluster on the GV fault is analogous to the Landers source, which immediately triggered concentrated seismicity on part of the Hector Mine fault. Like at Napa, Coulomb stress imparted from Landers along most of the Hector Mine rupture zone was negative except near the cluster. Paleoseismic evidence for the GV fault yields a ~200-yr recurrence interval and ~400-yr elapsed time since the last large earthquake, in which case it might be close to rupture (Lienkaemper et al., 2014). We thus suggest that the hazard on the Concord-Green Valley fault has likely increased, and so should be closely monitored for seismicity, strain, and creep.",

            "abstract": "The 2014 South Napa earthquake provides an opportunity to reconsider the Mare Island earthquake of 31 March 1898, which caused severe damage to buildings at a Navy yard on the island. Revising archival accounts of the 1898 earthquake, I estimate a lower intensity magnitude, 5.8, than the value in the current Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast (UCERF) catalog (6.4). However, I note that intensity magnitude can differ from Mw by upwards of half a unit depending on stress drop, which for a historical earthquake is unknowable. In the aftermath of the 2014 earthquake, there has been speculation that apparently severe effects on Mare Island in 1898 were due to the vulnerability of local structures. No surface rupture has ever been identified from the 1898 event, which is commonly associated with the Hayward-Rodgers Creek fault system, some 10 km west of Mare Island (e.g., Parsons et al., 2003). Reconsideration of detailed archival accounts of the 1898 earthquake, together with a comparison of the intensity distributions for the two earthquakes, points to genuinely severe, likely near-field ground motions on Mare Island. The 2014 earthquake did cause significant damage to older brick buildings on Mare Island, but the level of damage does not match the severity of documented damage in 1898. The high intensity files for the two earthquakes are more over spatially shifted, with the centroid of the 2014 distribution near the town of Napa and that of the 1898 distribution near Mare Island, east of the Hayward-Rodgers Creek system. I conclude that the 1898 Mare Island earthquake was centered on or near Mare Island, possibly involving rupture of one or both strands of the Franklin fault, a low-slip-rate fault sub-parallel to the Rodgers Creek fault to the west and the West Napa fault to the east. I estimate Mw5.8 assuming an average stress drop; data are also consistent with Mw6.4 if stress drop was a factor of ≈3 lower than average for California earthquakes. I present intensity observations from the 2014 South Napa earthquake that suggest that it may have been a low stress drop event.",

            "abstract": "Near-fault surface deformation associated with the August 24, 2014 M6.0 South Napa earthquake included both coseismic and post-seismic slip. Initial synthesis of field observations and initial measurement and modeling of afterslip from traditional survey methods indicate that coseismic slip was minimal (<10 cm) within 8 km northward from the epicenter but post-seismic slip, in places, approached 40 cm. We collected reconnaissance photographs using professional-grade SLR cameras from a helicopter within 12 hours after the earthquake, and a more systematic collection of air photos the day after the earthquake. We also collected terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) data two days (on August 26) and twenty-two days (on September 22) after the earthquake along a 0.5 km length of the main fault trace, just south of State Highway 12. This study site is 6 km north of the southern end of the 15 km long surface rupture and 5 km south of the highest measured co-seismic slip. We used structure-from-motion (SfM) methods to mosaic, orthorectify, and generate dense point clouds from the photos. SfM data corroborates survey-based ground observations of limited (~5 cm or less) coseismic slip along the fault trace between CA State Highway 12 and Withers Road, on discontinuous left-stepping en echelon ruptures. By August 26, the surface rupture became nearly continuous, and cultural features extracted from the TLS point clouds indicate horizontal slip magnitudes between 15 and 27 cm, increasing northward. By September 22, slip magnitudes had increased to between 26 and 46 cm. The lower slip magnitudes are to the south at Withers Road, and the general trend is increased slip to the north, but there is more slip variability along the fault trace in the September 15 data. From August 26 to September 15, the west side of the fault trace uplifted between 0.5 and 5 cm relative to east side. Increased relief on the surface rupture itself indicated a slight compressional component of the deformation. These results confirm that post-event air photos can be useful for rapid 3D mapping, and that the unparalleled accuracy of TLS data can be used to quantify even very subtle deformation patterns in three dimensions and document changes through time.",

In the August 24, 2014 South Napa earthquake, ElarmS' first alert was sent to the Decision Module of the ShakeAlert system, with a magnitude of 5.7, 5.1 sec after the rupture started. The alert was based on P-wave triggers from four stations and took 3.3 s to produce after the waves arrived at the seismic station nearest to the epicenter (6.5 km). The latencies of the four stations contributed to the first ranged from 0.27 to 2.62 seconds, contributing to a total delay of 2.3 sec, with a concommitant increase in the blind zone, the region with no warning. Overall the magnitude estimate and event location were stable from the initial alert onwards. We will report on the development of the magnitude estimate as a function of time, as well as the performance of ElarmS as data from additional stations were integrated into its estimates of the quake's location and magnitude. We will highlight, in particular, the configuration of ElarmS and the requirements on earthquake early warning station density and data feeds that allow the very rapid reporting of earthquake parameters for earthquake alert systems.",

            "abstract": "Tectonic ground deformation due to the 24 August 2014 M6 South Napa earthquake was recorded by continuous GPS (CGPS) sites of the Plate Boundary Observatory, Bay Area Regional Deformation, and USGS networks. Additionally, survey-mode GPS (SGPS) measurements were carried out following the event to densify the spatial coverage and record postseismic deformation. We compare earthquake offsets estimated using two sets of time series for the same sites, one with position estimates at five minute intervals and the other at one day intervals. On average the offset magnitudes from the five-minute positions are ~70% those estimated from the daily data, demonstrating that substantial postseismic deformation occurred immediately following the coseismic slip. Fitting the daily position time series for sites within ~35 km of the epicenter with a combination of coseismic offset and a logarithmic decay that begins immediately following the event indicates that cumulative displacement from 25 August 2014 to 24 September 2014 is on average ~70% of the estimated displacement on 24 August at these sites. While earthquakes on creeping faults of the San Andreas system have often generated postseismic displacement of similar magnitude to the coseismic, the mapped trace associated with this earthquake was not known to creep.\nUsing the coseismic offsets estimated from the five-minute solutions and a Bayesian inference approach, the most likely planar fault that passes through the epicenter and intersects the Earth’s surface is vertical and strikes 155o, in good agreement with seismic moment tensor estimates. The peak GPS-inferred coseismic slip extends ~12 km northwest and up-dip of the hypocenter. Initial postseismic slip models derived from GPS data show shallow afterslip near and to the southeast of the inferred coseismic slip; the afterslip is generally shallower and southeast of the zone of aftershocks. However, the resulting GPS residuals exhibit more complex spatial patterns that are not well-fit with a simple planar geometry. Further collection and analysis of postseismic SGPS data, in combination with other geodetic observations, will help to characterize the postseismic deformation source process, its temporal evolution, and its relation to aftershocks.",

            "abstract": "The August 24, 2014 M 6.0 South Napa Earthquake was the largest earthquake to occur in the San Francisco Bay Area, home to more than 7 million people, in almost 25 years. The event occurred within an area of dense GPS instrumentation including continuous stations from the EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory, Bay Area Regional Deformation Network and other networks. Coseismic displacements of up to 3 cm were rapidly estimated within one day after the event, providing a map of Earth shape change at over one hundred stations around the epicenter.\nThe earthquake thus presets as an excellent “teachable moment” to introduce students to basic geoscience concepts, modern geophysical methods, and the state of knowledge in earthquake science. We have developed an example exercise that uses GPS-derived interseismic velocities and coseismic offsets to explore deformation in the vicinity of the earthquake rupture. This exercise builds on the UNAVCO education resource “Infinitesimal Strain Analysis Using GPS Data” (http://www.unavco.org/education/resources/educational-resources/lesson/majors-gps-strain/majors-gps-strain.html), a module designed to introduce undergraduate geoscience majors to concepts of crustal deformation using GPS velocity data. In the module students build their intuition about infinitesimal strain through manipulation of physical models, apply this intuition to interpret maps of GPS velocity vectors, and ultimately calculate the instantaneous deformation rate of triangles on the Earth’s surface defined by three GPS sites.\nThe South Napa data sets provide an example with clear societal relevance that can be used to explore the basic concepts of deformation, but may also be extended to explore topics such as strain accumulation, release, and transfer associated with the earthquake cycle. The UNAVCO module could be similarly extended to create additional exercises in response to future events with clear geodetic signals.",

The M 6.0 South Napa earthquake occurred on 24 August 2014. The area was flown 29 May 2014 preceeding the earthquake, and again on 29 August 2014, five days after the earthquake. The UAVSAR results show slip on a single fault at the south end of the rupture near the epicenter of the event. The rupture branches out into multiple faults further north near the Napa area. A combined inversion of rapid GPS results and the unwrapped UAVSAR interferogram indicate nearly pure strike slip motion. Using this assumption, the UAVSAR data show horizontal right-lateral slip across the fault of 19 cm at the south end of the rupture and increasing to 70 cm northward over a distance of 6.5 km. The joint inversion indicates slip of ~30 cm on a network of sub-parallel faults is concentrated in a zone about 17 km long. The lower depths of the faults are 5-8.5 km. The eastern two sub-parallel faults break the surface, while three faults to the west are buried at depths ranging from 2-6 km with deeper depths to the north and west. The geodetic moment release is equivalent to a M 6.1 event. Additional ruptures are observed in the interferogram, but the inversions suggest that they represent superficial slip that does not contribute to the overall moment release.",

            "abstract": "Seasonally dry springs and creeks began flowing over a broad region in the hills around Napa following the M6.0 South Napa earthquake on August 24, 2014. Flows in hillside creek beds, which were dry before the earthquake, were reported from 19 km west, to 6 km east, and 18 km north of Napa and the epicenter, an area that shook at MMI≥VI. The exact timing of the increased flow is unknown because the earthquake occurred at 3:20 AM PDT. A gaging station on the Napa River, which is downstream from several tributaries that began flowing after the earthquake, showed a sudden increase of flow rate within 45 minutes following the earthquake. The sudden increase at the gaging station suggests flows initiated either contemporaneously with or very soon after the strong shaking. This timing is consistent with eyewitness accounts of other streams and springs at daylight, a few hours after the earthquake. One of the largest increases of streamflow was in Green Valley, where a streamflow rate of about 100 cubic hectometers per day was measured in Wild Horse Creek. Two types of waters are being discharged in the Wild Horse Creek drainage: 1) water with low iron concentration that has exchanged with rhyolitic flows and tuffs in the upper part of the drainage; and 2) high iron concentration water that has exchanged with basaltic andesite in the middle part of drainage (vertical interval of about 75 meters). The high iron waters are depositing FeOOH other iron phases. Mixing of the two water types results in water with pH 6.9 and conductivity of 0.197 mS. This water is used by the Vallejo Water District for domestic purposes after it is mixed with recent surface water runoff stored in Lake Frey reservoir in order to improve its quality. Other drainages that have increased flow since the earthquake have water chemistry consistent with exchange with rhyolitic flows and tuffs that are the dominant rock type in these drainages.",

Continuous sites from the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO), Bay Area Regional Deformation (BARD) and other publicly-available networks lie mostly in the far-field, greater than 15 km from the epicenter. The near-field is covered by two networks of survey GPS sites, one observed by the University of California, Riverside (UCR) and MIT, and the other by the US Geological Survey (USGS).\nFirst, we present the pre-earthquake GPS velocity solution from the combination of these networks, covering the entire Pacific-North America plate boundary zone north of San Francisco Bay. We take 1-D fault-perpendicular profile and block model approaches to fit the GPS velocities, both with and without an explicit West Napa Fault, to update previous estimates of slip rates on faults to the east of the Rodgers Creek Fault, which include the West Napa and Green Valley Faults.\nSecond, we present results from the survey GPS field response to the South Napa earthquake. 13 survey sites within 20 km of the epicenter were re-observed within 15 hours of the earthquake by a UCR-MIT group with assistance from UC Berkeley. An additional two sites to the north of the rupture were re-observed within 36 hours. A USGS-led group re-observed 17 sites within 25 km of the epicenter, as well as sites further afield. In total, 35 survey-mode GPS instruments were deployed to observe post-earthquake motions for up to four weeks after the event.\nMaximum displacements of greater than 20 cm are observed at two survey GPS sites within 2 km and either side of the surface rupture, in agreement with visual inspection of surface rupture offsets. Other observed survey sites within 20 km show at least 2 cm of displacement and 22 continuous GPS sites show displacements that are statistically significant at the 2-sigma level. Further, we show post-earthquake displacements over time as a result of this event relative to our precise pre-earthquake velocity solution.",

            "abstract": "We used the seismo-lineament analysis method (SLAM; http://bearspace.baylor.edu/Vince_Cronin/www/SLAM/) to \"predict\" the location of the fault that produced the M 6.0 South Napa earthquake of 24 August 2014, using hypocenter and focal mechanism data from NCEDC (http://www.ncedc.org/ncedc/catalog-search.html) and a digital elevation model from the USGS National Elevation Dataset (http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/). The ground-surface trace of the causative fault (i.e., the Browns Valley strand of the West Napa fault zone; Bryant, 2000, 1982) and virtually all of the ground-rupture sites reported by the USGS and California Geological Survey (http://www.eqclearinghouse.org/2014-08-24-south-napa/) were located within the north-striking seismo-lineament. We also used moment tensors published online by the USGS and GCMT (http://comcat.cr.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/nc72282711#scientific_moment-tensor) as inputs to SLAM and found that their northwest-striking seismo-lineaments correlated spatially with the causative fault.  We concluded that SLAM could have been used as soon as these mechanism solutions were available to help direct the search for the trace of the causative fault and possible rupture-related damage.\nWe then considered whether the seismogenic fault could have been identified using SLAM prior to the 24 August event, based on the focal mechanisms of smaller prior earthquakes reported by the NCEDC or ISC (http://www.isc.ac.uk). Seismo-lineaments from three M~3.5 events from 1990 and 2012, located in the Vallejo-Crockett area, correlate spatially with the Napa County Airport strand of the West Napa fault and extend along strike toward the Browns Valley strand (Bryant, 2000, 1982). Hence, we might have used focal mechanisms from smaller earthquakes to establish that the West Napa fault is likely seismogenic prior to the South Napa earthquake. Early recognition that a fault with a mapped ground-surface trace is seismogenic, based on smaller earthquakes, can facilitate appropriate preparatory work to minimize damage during a larger-magnitude event.",

            "abstract": "ShakeAlert, the demonstration earthquake early warning system, developed by the USGS, UC Berkeley, Caltech, ETH, and the University of Washington, functioned as expected for the August 24, 2014, M6.0 Napa earthquake. The first ShakeAlert was generated by the ElarmS algorithm 5.1 sec after the origin time of the earthquake, and 3.3 sec after the P-wave arrived at the closest station 6.5 km from the epicenter. This initial alert, based on P-wave triggers from four stations, estimated the magnitude to be 5.7. The warning was received at the UC Berkeley Seismological Laboratory 5 seconds before the S-wave and about 10 sec prior to the onset of the strongest shaking. ShakeAlert beta-testers across the San Francisco Bay Area simultaneously received the alert, including the San Francisco 911 center with 8 sec warning, and the BART train system. BART has implemented an automated train-stopping system that was activated (although no trains were running at 3:20 am). With the available network geometry and communications, the blind zone of the first alert had a radius of 16 km. The four stations that contributed to the first alert all encapsulate data into 1-second packets, but the latency in transmitting data to the processing center ranged from 0.27 to 2.62 seconds. If all the stations were to deliver data in 0.27 seconds, then the alert would have been available 2.3 sec sooner and the blind zone would be reduced to about 8 km. This would also mean that the city of Napa would have received about 1 second of warning. The magnitude estimate and event location were accurate from the initial alert onwards. The magnitude estimate did first increase to 5.8 and then dip to 5.4 2.6 sec after the initial alert, stayed at that level for 2 sec, and then returned to 5.7. The final magnitude estimate was 6.0, consistent with the ANSS catalog.",

            "abstract": "The August 24, 2014 South Napa, CA earthquake caused extensive surface rupture of a ~15 km zone along the western edge of Napa valley, including portions of the previously mapped West Napa fault. In the days following the event, growing offsets in cultural features crossing the main rupture strand indicated the occurrence of significant shallow afterslip. Here we use near-field campaign GPS data and InSAR data that closely bracket the earthquake and its early postseismic period to constrain models of the slip on that fault during and after the event. A joint inverse modeling approach based upon Akaike’s Bayesian Information Criterion (ABIC) is used to optimally weight the contributions of each dataset and the smoothing constraint that we apply.\nOur model inputs are: (i) a GPS dataset, comprising pre-event data collected in campaign mode six weeks before the mainshock and three weeks of post-event data starting 8–36 hours after the mainshock collected in semi-continuous mode, from sites at distances 2–20 km from the rupture; and (ii) quadtree-downsampled InSAR data from both descending and ascending passes of the COSMO-SkyMed satellite constellation (first post-event acquisitions made 3 and 10 days after the mainshock, respectively). The former provide strong control on the timing of fault slip, the latter provide strong spatial constraints on fault location and geometry. Preliminary results indicate that the majority of coseismic slip occurred on a NNW-striking subvertical fault plane whose location is consistent with the mapped main surface rupture strand. The pattern of slip shallows significantly from the hypocenter along-strike to the NNW, peaking at ~1 m of slip at depths of 2–4 km, ~8 km NNW of the hypocenter.",

            "abstract": "We performed three-dimensional (3D) anelastic finite difference simulations to investigate the effects of rupture details and sub-surface structure (including surface topography) on motions for the August 24, 2014 South Napa M6.0 earthquake, its aftershocks and nearby earthquakes. We compared observed seismic ground motions and static displacements (from GPS and InSAR) with motions computed with 3D simulations. Calculations were performed with the SW4 finite difference code, which computes the transient motions and permanent displacements including the effects of 3D structure based on the USGS San Francisco Bay Area 3D model (version USGSBayAreaVM-08.3.0.etree) and surface topography. We investigated the response using both an average plane-layered (one-dimensional, 1D) and the USGS 3D structure. We computed motions for available models of the mainshock rupture (including the model reported by Dreger, 2014 from broadband seismic waveforms). To unravel the effects of earthquake rupture and propagation through complex 3D structure, we modeled both the M6 mainshock and smaller (M3-4) nearby events, which can be represented as simple point moment tensor sources. The computed ground motions were compared to observations. For the seismic ground motions, the simulated motions with the 3D model (up to 1 Hz) produce remarkably better fits to the data than the average 1D model, suggesting there are significant path effects due to sedimentary basins and other sub-surface features. Aftershocks are well modeled for most paths, including paths crossing sedimentary basin structures in the Napa Valley and San Pablo Bay, indicating that the USGS 3D model can reasonably predict complex path effects. The M6.0 South Napa mainshock ruptured toward the north and resulted in complex high-frequency response in the backward directivity direction to the south, which we have not yet been able to reproduce with simulations and may require addition of finer details in the rupture model. Preliminary comparisons of simulations with geodetic displacements reported from GPS data suggest 3D structure slightly alters directions and amplitudes of displacements. We will attempt to model the geodetic displacements reported from both GPS and InSAR data.",

            "abstract": "A M6.0 earthquake occurred in South Napa County on August 24, 2014. We recorded aftershocks and conducted S-wave velocity (VS) surveys using a passive surface method at three sites in Napa.\nOn the day of the earthquake, we confirmed surface rupture for at least 5 km. Seismographs were deployed at three locations the day after the mainshock; on east side of Napa Valley (CSUEB-3), the west side (CSUEB-2), and at Stone Bridge School (CSUEB-1 SBS), which is located directly on the line of surface rupture (Fig. 1). The seismographs recorded continuous data for two weeks. At least 60 aftershocks with magnitudes between 1.0 and 3.9 were recorded. Preliminary analysis indicates a difference in local amplification of horizontal ground motion for 1-5 Hz, with amplitudes on the west side of Napa Valley larger than those on the east side.\nA passive surface wave survey using the two-station spatial autocorrelation (2ST-SPAC) method was conducted at each of the aftershock observation sites. At each site, one seismograph was established at a fixed location and recorded ambient noise for the duration of the survey. A second seismograph was placed at a series of different locations, with the distance from the fixed station ranging from 5 to 40 m. At each measurement location, ambient noise was recorded for intervals ranging from 5 to 20 minutes using a 10 ms sample rate, for a total of approximately one hour of data acquisition per site. The vertical component of ambient noise was used in the SPAC analysis to calculate phase velocity. Fig. 2 shows a VS profile at Stone Bridge School (CSUEB-1), which consists of two layers; the first with VS of about 150 m/sec and the second with VS of 400-500 m/sec. Depth to the second layer is about 20 m.",

            "abstract": "The 08/24/2014 M6.0 South Napa earthquake is the largest seismic event to strike the San Francisco Bay Area since the 10/17/1989 M6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake. The South Napa event caused severe damage near the epicenter. Based on the Northern California Seismic Network (NCSN) catalog, we find a clear increase of seismicity near the Geysers Geothermal Field following the South Napa event, which is located along its rupture directivity path ~50 km NNW from the hypocenter. Visually inspecting 10 Hz high-pass filtered waveforms at seismic stations near Geysers, we can identify many local earthquakes during the surface waves of the mainshock event that are missing from the NCSN catalog. To obtain a more complete catalog, we apply a recently developed matched filter technique to detect new events within continuous seismic recordings from 74 seismic stations near the Geysers. We use 4000 local earthquakes listed in the NCSN catalog from 06/01/2014 to 09/10/2014 as templates and systematically scan continuous data within ±7 days from the South Napa mainshock. As a result, we detect ~10 times more earthquakes than in the NCSN catalog, and the magnitude of completeness reduces from 0.75 to -0.6. Of the 8091 new events, 28 occurred within the mainshock wavetrain. Depending on the filter used, the first triggered event has an inferred magnitude in the range 3.6-4.0. The intensive seismic activity near the Geysers gradually decays with a p-value of ~0.7 and returns to pre-shock level in about one day. We fit the seismicity rate in the week prior to the South Napa event with the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model and extrapolate to obtain a post-mainshock rate. The observed post-mainshock seismicity rate clearly deviates from the ETAS prediction, which suggests that not all increased seismicity near the Geysers can be explained as aftershocks of the first triggered event. Instead these new events may be associated with stress transients (e.g. creep) or fluid migration. Moreover, the spatial-temporal pattern of the detected events shows possible NW migration, which supports the creep or fluid migration hypothesis. Our next step is to repeat this analysis using events from the more complete Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) catalog as templates to detect additional events. Our updated results will be presented at the meeting.",

            "abstract": "In an attempt to determine the continuity and lateral extent of the causative fault(s) of the 24 August 2014 Mw 6.0 Napa earthquake and possible interconnections with other mapped faults, we recorded aftershocks on three closely spaced (100 m) seismograph arrays that were positioned across the coseismic rupture zone and across mapped faults located north and south of coseismic rupture. Array 1 was located in northwest Napa, between Highway 29 and the intersection of Redwood and Mt. Veeder roads, array 2 was located southwest of Napa, ~1 km north of Cuttings Wharf, and array 3 was located south of San Pablo Bay, within the town of Alhambra. Our intent was to record high-amplitude guided waves that only travel within the causative fault zone and its extensions (Li and Vidale, 1996). Preliminary analysis of seismic data from an M 3.2 aftershock shows high-amplitude (up to 1 cm/s) seismic waves occurred on seismographs within 100 m of mapped surface ruptures and fault zones. Northwest of Napa, the high amplitudes along array 1 coincide with zones of structural damage and wide spread surface ground cracking, and along array 2 near Cuttings Wharf, the high amplitudes occur slightly east of surface ruptures seen along Los Amigas Road. We also observe relatively high-amplitude seismic waves across the Franklin Fault (array 3), approximately 32 km southeast of the mainshock epicenter; this observation suggests the West Napa and the Franklin faults may be continuous or connected. Existing fault maps show that the Franklin Fault extends at least 15 km southward to the Calaveras Fault zone and the West Napa Fault extends at least 25 km north of our array 1. Collectively, the mapped faults, surface ruptures, and guided waves suggest that the West Napa- Franklin Fault zone may extend more than 85 km before it merges with the Calaveras Fault. Assuming a continuous fault zone, the West Napa – Franklin Fault zone may be capable of generating a much larger magnitude earthquake that the Mw 6.0 that occurred on 24 August, 2014.",

            "abstract": "We performed detailed mapping along more than 1.3 km of surface rupture between Cuttings Wharf and CA-12 in order to characterize the location, width, orientation, amount, direction, and kinematics of permanent ground deformation produced in the hours, days, and weeks following the August 24 M6.0 South Napa earthquake.\nSurface rupture along a 550 m long reach between Middle Ave and South Ave near Los Carneros Ave is expressed as a series of right-stepping, 337° striking intervals roughly 2 to 6 m wide and 30 to 60 m long. The dextral component of displacement produced localized transpressional strain and formed narrow pressure ridges 15 to 20 cm high and 0.5 to 1.5 m wide. Each of these right-stepping reaches are composed of an irregular pattern of smaller scale (0.3 to 8 m long) left-stepping en echelon fractures striking 355° to 030°, with more easterly oriented fractures tending to be longer. In additional to pressure ridges, the deformation field exhibits a broad west-up sense of vertical displacement. Total station survey data from two faulted fence lines indicate 34 ± 4 cm and 30.5 ± 4.5 cm of dextral displacement and 15 ± 4 cm and 12 ± 2 cm of net west-up vertical displacement. The average direction of dextral displacement is 330° ± 5° along this reach.\nSurface rupture along a 800 m long reach from Las Amigas Road south to Los Carneros Creek is expressed as a series of left-stepping, N20°W striking intervals roughly 1.5 to 4 m wide and 40 to 70 m long. Each of these intervals are composed of a regular pattern of smaller scale (4 to 6 m long) left-stepping en echelon fractures striking 000° to 015°. Multiple measurements indicate a gradual southward decrease in the amount of dextral surface displacement from 12 ± 2 cm near Las Amigas Road to 7.5 ± 1.5 cm near Los Carneros Creek; these dextral displacements are consistently 2 to 3 times larger than co-located net west-up vertical displacements. The dominant direction of dextral displacement is 325° ± 5° along this reach, mostly accomodated by oblique expansion of tensional cracks. Pressure ridge deformation commonly observed along the northern reach is absent here, indicating a transition from transpressional deformation (north) to transtensional deformation (south) that is coincident with the spatial pattern of compound scarp production/preservation shown on many pre-earthquake fault maps.",

            "abstract": "The M6.0 South Napa mainshock produced fewer aftershocks than expected for a California earthquake of its magnitude, which became apparent a few days into the sequence. In the first 4.5 days, only 59 M≥1.8 aftershocks had occurred, the largest of which was a M3.9 that happened a little over two days after the mainshock. In contrast, during the same time period the 2004 M6.0 Parkfield earthquake had over 220 M≥1.8 aftershocks, 6 of which were M≥4. Here I investigate the aftershock productivity and other sequence statistics of the South Napa sequence and compare it with other M~6 California mainshock-aftershock sequences. By focusing on similar size events, they have similar finite extents within the seismotectonic environment. While the productivities of these sequences vary quite a bit, the b-values of the magnitude-frequency distributions all fall in the 0.6-0.8 range for the northern California sequences, slightly lower than the b-value of ~1 typical of southern California seismicity. Despite the relatively low productivity of the South Napa sequence, I show that the Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model (Ogata, JASA, 1988) describes the sequence well and investigate whether the ETAS model parameters suggest that low-productivity sequences are typical for the region. I also explore how quickly after a mainshock these types of models can capture the low productivity of the sequence. The productivity of a sequence is a critical parameter in determining the aftershock probabilities reported in the days following the mainshock. Therefore, the sooner an accurate representation of the aftershock productivity can be obtained, the sooner more accurate aftershock probability reports can be produced.",

The latest M6.0 event of August 24 in South Napa, generated a pre-earthquake signature during our prospective tests for California, and an experimental warning was documented about 17 days in advance.\nWe process in controlled environment different satellite and ground data for California and several other test areas by using: A.) TIR (thermal infrared) data from the NPOES recording long-wavelength radiation (OLR) and; B.) 2/GNSS, FORMOSAT (GPS/TEC); 3) Earth Observing System assimilation models from NASA and 4) ground-based gas observations and meteorological data.\nOn Aug 4th, we detected (prospectively) a large anomaly of OLR transient field in the atmosphere over Northern California. The location was shifted in the northeast direction about 150 km from the Aug 23rd epicentral area. Compared to the reference field of August 2004 to 2014, a rapid change in the thermals anomalous flux rate, of >1.6 W/m2 at 7:00AM LT been observed on Aug 4. The hotspot anomaly was the largest energy flux anomaly over the entire continental United States at this time. Based on the temporal and spatial estimates of the anomaly, on August 4th we issued an internal warning for a M5.5+ earthquake in Northern California within the next 1-4 weeks. Our approach needs additional continuous validation. The results could be explained within the framework of a model of Lithosphere-Atmosphere-Ionosphere Coupling between the crust and the atmosphere/ionosphere.",

            "abstract": "The rate of ambient tremor activity in the Parkfield-Cholame area of California increased by a factor of ~10 beginning between 11 and 12 hours after August 24, 2014 M6.0 S. Napa earthquake and lasted for ~ 48 hours. Over the subsequent 26 days, rates diminished but remained elevated, and on Sept. 22, 2014, rates increased again to levels comparable to those immediately following the South Napa event. This second episode has continued through the end of the analysis period (Sept. 24). The proportion of tremors beneath Monarch Peak (NW of Parkfield-Cholame) also increased during this second episode, suggesting a migration of tremor deep slow-slip to the northwest. The rate of tremor since the Napa earthquake is the largest observed in the Parkfield-Cholame area since the ambient tremor triggered by the 2004 Parkfield M6 earthquake and is approximately as energetic. This is in spite of the fact that the South Napa earthquake was over 300 km further away from the Parkfield-Cholame tremor zone. This suggests a heightened sensitivity to stress change in the Parkfield-Cholame tremor zone and that significant changes in conditions within the deep SAF may have taken place. The increased rates of tremor and the general association of changing tremor rates with deformational transients and slow-slip also suggest that the South Napa event may have triggered a large, deep slow-slip episode at a great distance and along a critical section of the San Andreas Fault (i.e., where the 1857 Ft. Tejon M7.8 earthquake apparently nucleated). This presentation will include monitoring results tracking the ongoing unusual tremor activity up through the week prior to the Fall AGU meeting and will compare this tremor evolution with ongoing seismicity and another delayed ambient tremor episode in the Bitterwater area of the SAF that was apparently triggered by the 1998 San Juan Baustista M5.1 earthquake.",

            "abstract": "The South Napa earthquake generated peak ground motions in excess of 50%g and 50 cm/s in Napa Valley and also along strike to the south, and was recorded at 17 stations within 20 km rupture distance (Rrup) of the finite fault plane, 115 stations within 50 km, and 246 within 100 km. We compare the densely recorded ground motions to existing ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) to understand both the spatial distribution of ground-motion amplitudes and also the relative excitation and attenuation terms from the earthquake. Using the ground-motion data as reported by ShakeMap, we examine the peak ground acceleration (PGA) and velocity, as well as the pseudo-spectral acceleration (PSA) at 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 seconds, adjusted empirically to a single site condition of 760 m/s. Overall, the ground motions on the north-south components are larger than those on the east-west, consistent with both the generally north-south strike of the fault and the rupture directivity. At the higher frequencies (PGA and PSA of 0.3 s), the close data are very consistent with the GMPEs, implying a median stress drop near 5 MPa. For the longer period data, the GMPEs underpredict the data at close stations. At all frequencies, the distance attenuation seems to be stronger than the GMPEs would predict, which could either be a station coverage bias, given that most of the stations are to the south of the epicenter, or may indicate that the attenuation structure in the Napa and delta region is stronger than the average attenuation in California, on which the GMPEs were built. The spatial plot of the ground motion residuals is positive to the north, in both Napa and Sonoma Valley, consistent with both the directivity and basin effect. More interestingly, perhaps, is that there is strong ground motion to the south, as well, in the along-strike direction, particularly for PSA at 1.0s. These strongly positive residuals align along an older, Quaternary fault structure associated with the Franklin or Southampton fault, potentially indicating a fault-zone guided wave.",

            "abstract": "Secondary effects of earthquakes sometimes include widespread landsliding where strong ground motions exceed 0.2g PGA, although many earthquakes that generate sufficient ground motions do not have landsliding. For example, the South Napa earthquake of August 24, 2014 failed to produce appreciable landsliding in the presence of steep topography despite PGA estimates in excess of 0.5g. We calculate minimum strength estimates for near surface rock units using a Newmark analysis that predicts slope stability during an earthquake based on local topography, peak ground acceleration, and Mohr-Coulomb strength parameters. When considering other earthquakes with large landslide events, we determine that the minimum strength of Napa surficial rocks are comparable to total strength estimates from southern California during the 1994 Northridge and Taiwan during the 1999 Chi Chi earthquakes, but are substantially weaker than estimates from western China during the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. These comparisons suggest that minimum estimates from the South Napa earthquake may be representative of the average strength. If correct, then we would predict widespread landsliding in even a slightly larger event or under wet conditions. Because rock strength at the spatial scale calculated here integrates the effects of climate, tectonic history and lithology, short-term variability due to recent rainfall and drought conditions also should be considered. Hillslope strength estimates from different earthquake events underscores the need to better quantify hillslope strength in various settings and under a range of conditions, in order to more accurately predict landslide hazards associated with large earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "A magnitude 6.0 earthquake struck southern Napa county northeast of San Francisco, California, on Aug. 24, 2014, causing significant damage in the city of Napa and nearby areas. One day after the earthquake, the Advanced Rapid Imaging and Analysis (ARIA) team produced and released observations of coseismic ground displacement measured with continuous GPS stations of the Plate Boundary Observatory (operated by UNAVCO for the National Science Foundation) and the Bay Area Rapid Deformation network (operated by Berkeley Seismological Laboratory). Three days after the earthquake (Aug. 27), the Italian Space Agency’s (ASI) COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) satellite acquired their first post-event data. On the same day, the ARIA team, in collaboration with ASI and University of Basilicata, produced and released a coseismic interferogram that revealed ground deformation and surface rupture. The depiction of the surface rupture – discontinuities of color fringes in the CSK interferogram – helped guide field geologists from the US Geological Survey and the California Geological Survey (CGS) to features that may have otherwise gone undetected. Small-scale cracks were found on a runway of the Napa County Airport, as well as bridge damage and damaged roads. ARIA’s response to this event highlighted the importance of timeliness for mapping surface deformation features. ARIA’s rapid response products were shared through Southern California Earthquake Center’s response website and the California Earthquake Clearinghouse. A damage proxy map derived from InSAR coherence of CSK data was produced and distributed on Aug. 27. Field crews from the CGS identified true and false positives, including mobile home damage, newly planted grape vines, and a cripple wall failure of a house. Finite fault slip models constrained from CSK interferograms and continuous GPS observations reveal a north-propagating rupture with well-resolved slip from 0-10.5 km depth. We also measured along-track coseismic displacements of about -30 to 30 cm, along the main surface rupture, using multiple aperture interferometry and SAR pixel offset calculation. We also processed the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-1A data on Sep. 3 and compared the result with the CSK interferogram, finding a general agreement between the two observations of surface deformation.",

            "abstract": "A previous study that analyzed global major earthquakes of magnitude 7.6 and above for the 1897 to 1977 period suggests that random occurrence of these earthquakes is very unlikely (Olsson 1982). Following an analysis of global major earthquakes of magnitude 7 and above for the 1901 to January 2010 period, a recent study attempts to show an association between major global earthquake and cyclic lunisolar alignment events (Ejeta 2011). The latter study suggests that the inverse square relationship in Newton’s law of universal gravitation is likely to explain the physics behind the skewed occurrences of major earthquake events around these alignment events. Using random and non-random occurrence analysis, this paper will present the likelihoods of major global earthquakes since 1990 through September 2014 and how the magnitude 6.0 Napa earthquake of 2014 may be a particular realization of the observed association. Specifically, it will show that using the random occurrence approach, the average probability of occurrence on any day of the 396 major earthquakes recorded by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) during the selected period, which has 9,039 days, is about 4.4%. It will also show that based on the observed association, these events are skewed, with average probabilities of about 39% and 68%, respectively, towards one and two days within lunisolar alignment events recorded by the National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA) during the same period. Of the 396 major earthquake events during the selected period, 154 and 271 occurred, respectively, within one and two days of either new, first quarter, full, or last quarter moon days. This result suggests that a major earthquake event that occurred during this period was more likely than not to have occurred within two days of an alignment event. The magnitude 6.0 Napa earthquake of August 24, 2014, occurred within a day of the August 25, 2014, new moon day. This paper suggests that further research and insight is likely to increase this skewed probability and calls for a continued research into the likelihood of earthquakes and their global spatial distributions around known tectonic plates. It also poses the question of the impact that better awareness about this likelihood may have on the normal functioning of the built environment.",

            "abstract": "A major goal of the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) was to enable researchers to study the role aseismic transients play in the earthquake cycle. To attain this goal the Observatory includes 75 borehole tensor strainmeters (BSMs) installed in targeted regions, one being the area to the north and east of San Francisco. The M6.0 August 24, 2014 South Napa earthquake was the largest earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area in 25 years and provides an excellent opportunity to examine the response of BSMs to a nearby strong earthquake and analyze the temporal evolution of the postseismic shear strains. In this presentation we will document the co and postseismic signals recorded by the two PBO BSMs in the area, one in Lucas Valley, north of San Francisco, at 30 km from the epicenter and the other in the East Bay, 3 km from the Hayward Fault and 40 km from the event. One month after the event the Lucas Valley instrument continues to record a large postseismic signal in the shear strains. We will compare the coseismic offsets as recorded by the BSMs with those predicted using elastic half-space dislocation theory and with those recorded by nearby USGS borehole instruments and characterize the temporal behavior of the postseismic signal at the Lucas Valley strainmeter.\nUNAVCO operates a network of 1100 GPS sites and 75 BSMs as part of the NSF funded PBO program.

            "abstract": "At 3 am local time on August 24, 2014 the MW 6.0 South Napa earthquake shook the northern California Bay Area, resulting in 200 injuries and damage estimated near $1 billion. The event occurred within an area of dense GPS instrumentation including continuous stations from the EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory, Bay Area Regional Deformation Network, and other networks. Many of these stations telemeter data in real time or near real time, allowing for the rapid estimation of coseismic displacements and subsequent aseismic deformation.\nWe processed data from these networks as part of a mega-network solution from over 12,895 globally distributed stations using the GIPSY/OASIS software. We obtained 5 minute and 24 hour sample rate solutions using orbit products from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory with various latencies: ultra rapids (2 hour latency), rapids (next day latency) and finals (10 day latency). To assess the resolvability of deformation from M6 earthquakes and subsequent postseismic slip inside the dense California network we used these products to estimate coseismic offsets at the GPS stations at various times after the event.\nThe event was clearly detected as steps in the 5 minute rapid and 24 hour time series. The day following the event we measured significant coseismic displacements at 9 stations, with 3 stations having signal to noise ratio greater than 2 (accounting for scatter in the rapid 5 minute time series), and a maximum displacement of 28 mm. Displacements were significant up to 48 km from the event, and had a quad-lobe pattern typical of strike slip earthquakes on northwest striking vertical faults. During the following 30 days the resolution of the displacement field increased as more data were collected and the dataset became more complete. The maximum displacement increased significantly to 35 mm, consistent with continued postseismic afterslip on the west Napa fault.\nThe similarity between final solutions and positions obtained from rapid 5 minute time series suggests that rapidly estimated coseismic offsets from GPS are accurate enough to rapidly assess earthquake effects and monitor the evolution of afterslip. Future applications of rapid 5 minute time series could include, e.g., best-latency updates of static stress transfer during continued postseismic afterslip.",

            "abstract": "The 2014 South Napa Earthquake is the largest inland event in northern California since the 1989 Mw6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake. The earthquake was well recorded by the seismic, geodetic (i.e., InSAR and GPS) instruments as well as field observations which provide excellent data sets to investigate the kinematic slip distribution and postseismic deformations. The two InSAR images, with date pairs of 2014/07/26-2014/08/27 and 2014/08/07-2014/08/31, show very consistent deformation patterns that can be well explained by a slip model with two major asperities of similar peak slip amplitude. The static inversion prefers eastward dipping fault geometry with dip angles of about 82 degree. The hypocenter location of the earthquake was relocated by using the P-wave arrivals on the nearest strong motion stations. The refined epicenter is located at about 1km to the east of the major surface rupture, indicating a high angle east dipping fault geometry which is consistent with the static inversion results. Despite its large hypocenter depth (11km), finite fault inversion using strong motion waveform data displays two major asperities centroid at the depth of 5km (first) and 3 km (second), and is about 7km and 11km north of the hypocenter along the strike, respectively. The aftershock locations from the 1D catalog, however, are mainly distributed 1 to 3 km to the west of the surface rupture, at the depth of 8 to 12 km. The risetimes in the kinematic slip model are mostly less than 1s with peak slip of about 1m, indicating a relatively fast slip rate (~1m/s), given its shallow location. The slip distribution is similar as in the static inversion, but has much smaller peak amplitude for the first asperity. Considering the rapid postseismic deformation observed in field, the larger slip amplitude in the static inversion might be contributed from the rapid postseismic slip at the depth of about 5km around the first asperity. The 1D velocity models used in the inversion have been verified with the M3.9 aftershock, which is also used to estimate the effect of 3D velocity structure near the source by 3D FD calculation. The comparison between 1D and 3D synthetics indicate that some basin paths can be better explained by the 3D velocity structure, which also produces better waveform fits for the mainshock with a kinematic slip model as input.",

            "abstract": "The extensive strong-ground motion data of the August 24 Mw 6.1 Napa Valley earthquake exhibits an interesting pattern of the strong ground motion. Although the slip models based on seismic and geodetic data revealed mainly north-north-west rupture propagation, the largest ground acceleration of 0.94g was observed at a station south of the hypocenter, presumably associated with the initiation stage of this earthquake. Here, the kinematic and dynamic rupture process of this earthquake is studied using the strong-ground motion data in the vicinity (< 40 km) of the epicentre of the Napa Valley earthquake. Three inversion algorithms are applied. First, a conventional non-linear finite fault inversion is conducted to constrain the overall slip history using relatively long period (> 1 s) seismic data. Second, a dynamic finite fault inversion, which approximates the rupture as multiple elliptical cracks, is carried out to understand what are the stress and strength conditions on the fault that produces a rupture history that is compatible with the observed data. Finally, an iterative Landweber back-projection algorithm is used to constrain the finer spatio-temporal rupture history associating with the high frequency radiation. The efforts particularly focus on the initiation stage of the fault rupture.",

            "abstract": "We characterize near-field deformation associated with the surface rupture of the M6.0 South Napa earthquake from repeat mobile laser scanning (MLS) surveys. Starting the day after the main shock, we operated, sometime simultaneously, short (~75 m range) and medium (~400m range) range laser scanners on a truck or backpack. We scanned most of the length of the principal and secondary surface ruptures at speeds less than 10 km/hr. Scanning occurred primarily in either suburban subdivisions or cultivated vineyards of varying varietals with differing leaf patterns and stages of maturity. Spot-spacing is dense enough (100s of points/m^2) to permit creation of 10-25cm digital elevation models of much of the surface rupture. Scanned features of the right-lateral rupture include classic mole tracks through a variety of soil types, en echelon cracks, offset vine rows, and myriad types of pavement-related deformation. We estimate coseismic surface displacements ranging from 5 to 45 cm by examining offset cultural features and vine rows and by comparing the MLS data with preexisting airborne laser scans from 2003 using point-cloud and solid-modeling methodologies. Additionally, we conducted repeat MLS scans to measure the magnitude and spatial variation of fault afterslip, exceeding 20 cm in some places, particularly in the southern portion of the rupture zone. We anticipate these data sets, in conjunction with independently collected ground-based alinement arrays and space-based geodetic data will contribute significant insight into topics of current debate including assessing the most appropriate material models for shallow fault zones and how shallow and deeper fault slip relate to one another.",

Results of such a study (with a rate of false positive of 35%) give an idea on the possible relevance of RST based TIR surveys in the framework of an operational, multi-parametric system for time-Dependent Assessment of Seismic Hazard (t-DASH).\nIn this paper all the data available from the new GOES-W satellite (in orbit in between 2010 and 2014) have been analysed by the same way in the case of the earthquake occurred on 24 August 2014 (M=6) over Napa valley (California). The results presented in this paper, even if still preliminary, seem to confirm the significance of RST based TIR survey in a t-DASH perspective.\nIt should however mentioned, that such an approach (even if not devoted to be used for short-term Earthquake Forecast outside a multiparametric t-DASH system), when compared with whatever traditional OEF (Operational Earthquake Forecast) method (like the one abandoned ten years ago in US but recently re-proposed for Italy) seems already to gives forecast reliabilities of orders of magnitude greater.",

            "abstract": "Numerous studies have investigated the statistical relationship between Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) and peak ground acceleration (PGA) and peak ground velocity (PGV). The Mw 6.0 South Napa (California) earthquake of August 24, 2014 provides valuable data to examine these relationships for both urban and rural environments within northern California. The finite fault model (D. Dreger, 2014) indicates that the fault rupture propagated predominantly NNW and up-dip from a 11-km-deep hypocenter. The epicentral location was 8 km SSW of downtown Napa. Recorded PGA north of the epicenter is as high as 600 cm/s2 and PGV locally reaches 80 cm/s. Field studies by two teams of investigators were conducted on August 24-26 and September 8-11, 2014 to assign MMI values at 108 sites. The highest MMI values are strongly localized along the NNW-SSE rupture trend north of the epicenter. Parts of the city of Napa and some communities several km farther north on Dry Creek Road were found to have experienced shaking intensities of MMI VII to VIII. The observed effects include houses moved off their foundations, chimney collapse or damage, cracked foundations and/or interior walls, broken windows, and the lateral displacement of heavy furniture. Communities to the east and west of this zone of high seismic intensity reported significantly lower values of MMI, typically IV and V even at distances as close as 10 km from the mapped surface rupture. In comparison with previous estimates by Wald et al. (1999) and Dangkua and Cramer (2011), we find that MMI III-VIII uniformly correspond to significantly larger (>150%) PGA and PGV values, as reported by the Center for Engineering Strong Motion Data (2014). We attribute this observation to two primary factors: (1) improved earthquake engineering in the post-Loma Prieta earthquake era that has led to building construction, both new and retrofitted, that is more resistant to earthquake strong ground motions; and (2) a frequency band relevant to these MMI estimates that contains less energy than that leading to the PGA or PGV values. The latter would primarily be a source effect.",

            "abstract": "The western United States has been experiencing severe drought since 2013, with some areas affected since 2012. The immediate solid earth response to the loss of water mass from the drought should be elastic rebound whose magnitude varies with load changes in both time and space. We have identified surface uplift from the current drought at continuously operating GPS stations in the EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory and inverted for the spatiotemporal pattern of mass loss consistent with the vertical GPS displacements. The mass loss is greatest in California's Sierra Nevada and Coastal Ranges, where it ranges up to 50 cm of water equivalent.\nSince the change in water loading due to the drought is not uniform, it induces spatially varying crustal strains. Some investigators have suggested that strains from changes in water loading place significant stresses on seismogenic faults, and we investigate this hypothesis for drought-induced load changes on the faults associated with the 2014 Mw6.0 South Napa earthquake. We calculate the Coulomb and other stress changes on these faults and assess whether they could have brought these faults closer to failure prior to the South Napa earthquake. We also extend this analysis to a broader selection of California faults to assess whether drought-induced load changes might have significantly changed stresses on faults elsewhere in the region.",

More than 14 km of complex surface faulting, extending from the Napa River at Cuttings Wharf northward beyond the north boundary of Alston Park in the city of Napa, occurred on two principal sub-parallel N-NW trending fault strands. Other minor sub-parallel rupture zones (≤1.5 km in length with ~1-3 cm displacements) were identified near the principal strands. The surface rupture lies primarily NW of the epicenter and W of most of the mapped traces of the West Napa fault zone, but rupture was locally coincident with portions of some mapped late Quaternary and older fault traces. Geomorphic expressions of prior faulting are observed intermittently along the main traces.\nSurface displacements are predominantly right lateral and typically expressed as discontinuous en echelonleft-stepping fractures within zones that range from <1 m, to tens of meters in width. The largest lateral offsets occurred on the western principal strand; coseismic slip was minimal near the epicenter but increased to 40-45 cm ~10 km to the NW. Farther north, in the Browns Valley area, offsets of 10-20 cm across roads, pipelines, and residential structures produced significant damage. The ~7 km-long eastern strand had coseismic dextral offsets of 2-8 cm. Its southern end lies 7.5 km NW of the epicenter and 1.1 km E of the western strand, while its northern end approaches the western strand where the two appear to merge a few hundred meters south of Alston Park.\nAfterslip has been documented along the western strand but was not observed on the eastern strand. It was most rapid in the middle third of the western strand, increasing initial slip by ≥20 cm one day after the mainshock. Repeated measurements suggest total slip may reach ~40 cm along half of the western strand. The complex character and locations of surface rupture produced by this event have significant implications for current approaches to fault hazard mapping in California.\nAdditional contributors: USGS: N.

            "abstract": "Recently, evidence that the ionosphere reacts in a reliable, reproducible manner before major earthquakes has been increasing. Fraser-Smith (1990) reported ULF magnetic field fluctuations prior to the Loma Prieta quake. Although not an ionospheric measurement, such magnetic fields before a quake are part of our explanation for the ionospheric effect. Heki (2011) and Heki and Enomoto (2013) reported in great detail the devastating March 11, 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake in which numerous GPS satellite/ground-station pairs showed apparent changes, both increases and decreases, starting 40 minutes before the event. We say “apparent” since our theory is that electric fields associated with stresses before an earthquake map through the ionosphere at the speed of light and raise or lower the main ionosphere. Both effects have been detected. Heki’s results for four quakes exceeding M = 7 are shown in Figure 4 of Heki (2011).\nBased on the inserted curve of Heki’s Figure 4 relating the size of the ionospheric effect to the quake’s magnitude, we were not optimistic about detecting an effect for the 6.0 Napa quake. However, it occurred at night, when the well-known shielding effect of the ionospheric D and lower E regions for EM fields becomes very small. When this special session with a later abstract deadline was announced, JPL researchers were asked to examine GPS data from California stations. Based on their data, the plot shown (left panel) combined with a similar plot for the Tohoku-Oki earthquake (right panel, based on Heki’s data) was produced. Both panels show fluctuations of STEC (Slant Total Electron Content) before the quake times (indicated by asterisks showing the positions of ionospheric penetration points (IPP) at the respective quake times). Although alternative explanations for the TEC fluctuations cannot be ruled out entirely, these results suggest that a patent-pending system able to predict an earthquake some 30 minutes before an event by using satellites and ground stations to measure disturbances in the earth’s ionosphere would be of great value. Such a system would be a major boon for vulnerable sites such as nuclear power plants and natural gas lines in populated areas as well as an early warning to evacuate vulnerable buildings, much like today’s early warning system for tornados.",

The earthquake was the largest in SF Bay Area since the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Economic loss topped $ 1 billion. Wine makers cleaning up and estimated the damage on tourism. Around 15,000 cases of lovely cabernet were pouring into the garden at the Hess Collection. Earthquake potentially raise water pollution risks, could cause water crisis. CA suffered water shortage recent years, and it could be helpful on how to prevent underground/surface water pollution from earthquake. This research gives a clear view on drinking water system in CA, pollution on river systems, as well as estimation on earthquake impact on water supply. The Sacramento-San Joaquin River delta (close to Napa), is the center of the state’s water distribution system, delivering fresh water to more than 25 million residents and 3 million acres of farmland. Delta water conveyed through a network of levees is crucial to Southern California. The drought has significantly curtailed water export, and salt water intrusion reduced fresh water outflows. Strong shaking from a nearby earthquake can cause saturated, loose, sandy soils liquefaction, and could potentially damage major delta levee systems near Napa. Napa earthquake is a wake-up call for Southern California. It could potentially damage freshwater supply system.",

            "abstract": "The Mw 6.0 South Napa Earthquake struck Napa County of California on 24 August 2014 with extensive surface ruptures mapped in the field and with satellite and airborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). The Italian Space Agency’s (ASI) has been acquiring COSMO-SkyMed™ (CSK) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of the Napa area since June 2013 with two different look directions (satellite moving south looking west, and satellite moving north and looking east). The Canadian Space Agency and partner MDA have been acquiring RADARSAT-2 (RS2) SAR images over the San Francisco area for several years, with partial coverage of the southern part of Napa County. Preliminary time series analysis of the CSK and RS2 SAR image time series before the 2014 earthquake shows moderate rates of surface deformation likely related to variations in ground water levels. By the end of September 2014, there were 6 CSK scenes on the descending track (first on 27 August 02:08 UTC) and two scenes on the ascending track (first on 3 September 13:55 UTC) acquired after the earthquake. We use GIAnT to extend the time series analysis across the time of the earthquake and calculate a better estimate of the coseismic deformation as a step function in the time interval between the date of the last pre-quake scene and first post-quake scene, plus a postseismic deformation time function. With the 6 CSK descending track scenes, the time series estimate of the coseismic deformation has much less of the atmospheric effects that are present in single interferograms, but the 2 CSK ascending track scenes do not provide as much improvement. The postseismic single interferograms are useful for seeing the early postseismic deformation. We observe rapid afterslip on both the ascending and descending interferograms, concentrated at shallow depth on the southern part of the main coseismic rupture, extending about 4 km north of the epicenter. We also observe what appears to be poroelastic rebound in the area west of the southern part of the rupture, which needs confirmation from additional observations and modeling.",

            "abstract": "Paleoseismic trenching in July 2014 across a previously mapped trace of the West Napa fault in eastern Alston Park (EAP) was undertaken with NEHRP funding as part of an effort to better characterize activity of the fault for regional seismic hazard assessments, and as part of an Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning (APEFZ) evaluation. The trench was excavated across a prominent escarpment that had been interpreted by others to represent evidence of Holocene fault activity, based on faults logged in an ~1-m-deep natural drainage exposure. Our trench was located ~3 m south of the drainage exposure and encompassed the interpreted fault zone, and beyond.\nThe trench exposed the same surficial units as the natural exposure, as well as additional Pleistocene and older stratigraphy at depth. Escarpment parallel channeling was evident within deposits along the base of the slope. Faulting was not encountered, and is precluded by unbroken depositional contacts. Our preferred interpretation is that the escarpment in EAP is a result of fluvial and differential erosion, which is consistent with existence of channels along the base of the escarpment and a lack of faulting.\nThe location of surface rupture of the South Napa Earthquake (SNE) of 8/24/14 occurred on fault strands south and west of this study and crosses Alston Park approximately 800 m west of our trench site, at its nearest point.\nPre- and post-earthquake UAVSAR from NASA’s JPL been useful in identifying major and minor ruptures of the SNE. Based on the imagery, a subtle lineament has been interpreted upslope from the trench. However, field observations along this feature yielded no visible surface deformation and the origin of this lineament is uncertain.\nThe fault rupture pattern expressed by the SNE, as reflected by detailed field mapping and UAVSAR imagery, provides a unique opportunity to better understand the complex nature of the West Napa fault. Our study illustrates the value of subsurface investigations as part of fault characterization in order to accurately assess geomorphic features that may, or may not, be formed by tectonic processes. Selection of additional trench locations will be aided by soon-to-be-released post-earthquake LiDAR imagery and existing UAVSAR imagery, with the ultimate goal of preparing an accurate APEFZ in this area.",

            "abstract": "Large distant earthquakes are known to trigger deep tectonic tremor along the Parkfield-Cholame section of the San Andreas Fault. The triggered tremors are mostly modulated by dynamic stresses from large-amplitude surface waves, although sometimes teleseismic body waves are also capable of triggering tremor. However, there are relatively few observations of triggering from regional-distance earthquakes. The 2014 M6.0 South Napa earthquake is the largest earthquake occurring in the Bay Area since the 1989 M6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake. It has triggered an increase of microearthquake activities in the Geysers geothermal field during and immediately following the mainshock waves (Meng et al., this meeting). Although we did not observe any obvious modulated tremors at Parkfield-Cholame during the Napa wavetrain, a small tremor episode occurred just NW of Parkfield coincident with the arrival of seismic waves at the 2.5 km-deep seismometer in the SAFOD main hole. A major tremor episode began about 10 hours later near Cholame (SE of Parkfield). This episode is one of the largest seen over the past several years, containing intense activity for ~3 days and taking more than 3 weeks to return to background levels. While it is impossible to entirely rule out random coincidence at this stage, minor activity beneath Cholame started only 90 minutes after the Napa event in a zone with significant episodes only every few months, suggesting that the major tremor episode may have been triggered. In addition, we plan to systematically examine both tremor catalogs and continuous waveforms following the occurrence of other recent earthquakes in California to better understand the ambient conditions and factors (including amplitude and frequency of the incoming waves) controlling tremor triggering in this region.",

            "abstract": "Multiple-aperture SAR interferometry (MAI) has been developed for measuring surface displacements in along-track direction as an alternative method of amplitude offset tracking method. Various studies on geological phenomena have been carried out using MAI technique with C-band and L-band SAR data, but application of MAI to X-band SAR is challenging due to its more severe temporal decorrelation compared to longer wavelength radar. The Italian Space Agency’s (ASI) COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) mission consisting of four identical radar satellites has a powerful capability to minimize temporal baselines maintaining high coherence. This offers a good chance for MAI application for precise measurement of along-track displacements. In this study, we demonstrate the MAI performance of X-band SAR for the M6.0, South Napa Earthquake occurred on August 24, 2014. A coseismic CSK pair data (July 26 and August 27, 2014) acquired from descending orbit was used to show the along-track displacements in the fault zone.\nIn order to evaluate the precision for measuring MAI deformation on the Napa Earthquake using CSK data, we produced a coherence map of the interferogram because the MAI precision is a function of interferometric coherence. However, we found that standard deviation of MAI phase does not coincide with the theoretical variation. The measurement uncertainty of along-track displacements was estimated by using the predefined empirical equation which was established through the performance test using multi-path CSK dataset at Kilauea Volcano region. The uncertainty map of the along-track displacements in the South Napa Earthquake region provides a reliable metric to estimate the variance/covariance of the data, useful for 3-D displacement field construction and geophysical modeling.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake lights (EQLs) in form of bright flashes have been documented multiple times by private security cameras during and after the M6.0 South Napa earthquake of Aug. 24, 2014. On the video records, series of flashes are seen rising out of the ground, sometimes in rapid succession, at other times as single events brightly illuminating the night sky. The EQLs appear to come from extended sources, probably up to hundreds of meters in lateral extent. Though few video records display accurate GPS-timing, most of the flashes were clearly co-seismic in the sense that they coincided with the local arrival of the seismic waves.\nThis pattern is consistent with records obtained by a surveillance camera and a seismometer co-located on the PUCP campus in Lima, Peru, during the arrival of the P and S waves from the M8.0 Pisco earthquake about 150 km to the southeast of Lima. Analysis of the PUCP and other video records, plus a number of eyewitness reports, indicate that the EQLs were associated (i) with the S waves and (ii) with mafic dykes.\nAttempts to see to detect the Napa EQLs on records of the GOES satellite were unsuccessful.\nUnusual conditions have to exist to produce electric discharges at the Earth's surface that can rise 100-200 m into the sky. Key to understanding the underlying processes is the fact that, when mafic rocks are stressed, positive hole charge carriers become activated, i.e. defect electrons in the oxygen anion sublattice. The higher the stress rate, the higher the currents, reaching currents on the order of 1-2 billion A/km3 during compaction of gabbro within 1-2 msec. Obviously, when S waves pass through rocks at velocities around 3.4 km/sec, large numbers of positive holes appear. Flowing out of the stressed rock volume they can create very high electric fields, leading to a number of follow-on processes including corona discharges. In Campbell near San Jose, about 60 km south of Napa, a security camera, motion-triggered by the arrival of the seismic waves, recorded electric arcs coming out of an unused power cord hanging off the eve of a private residence. The arc started to spark about 30 sec after the camera was triggered, bridging an air gap of 2.5-5 cm and continuing for at least 90 sec, suggesting up 100 kV.",

            "abstract": "The Qinling-Dabie orogenic belt was formed as the suture zone by the collision of the North China Block and the South China Block in the Late Triassic and it has been reactivated by the Indo-Asian collision since 60 million years ago. From July 2012 to May 2014 Peking University and Chinese Academy of Geological Science deployed a seismic array of 147 portable broadband seismic stations around the Qinling-Dabie orogenic belt. Here shear-wave splitting analysis of SKS data and finite-frequency tomography were applied to these data to imagine the seismic anisotropy and velocity structures in the upper mantle beneath the region. Large delay times were observed at the southwest corner of the Ordos Block and the northeast of Tibetan Plateau. Where the angles between the fast polarization directions and the GPS velocity vectors are relatively large but those in the Weihe rift and the North China plain are nearly parallel. Delay times are small, as expected, in the southeast of the Ordos Block and the north of Sichuan Basin with inconsistent fast polarization directions. Finite-frequency tomography clearly images a fast velocity anomaly under the Ordos block that extends down to 400 km depth and a slow velocity anomaly under the east of Weihe rift that can be traced down to 300 km depth. More importantly we observe a slow velocity anomaly in the upper mantle extending down to 200 km depth at the southwestern corner of the Ordos Block and the northeast of Tibetan Plateau, and the location corresponds well with the results of shear wave splitting showing large angles between the fast polarization directions and the GPS velocity vectors. These results suggest that it is possible that the mantle lithosphere of the southwestern corner of the Ordos Block could be thermally weakened by the eastward Tibetan mantle flow between the Ordos Block and Sichuan Basin.",

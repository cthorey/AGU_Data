            "abstract": "The Iberian Peninsula is located at the western part of Eurasia-Africa plate boundary. The SW of Iberia is a tectonically complex region, where starts the transition from oceanic to continental plate boundary. The occurrence of large and damaging earthquakes in this zone, such as the 1755 Lisbon (Imax=X) or the 1969 (Ms=8.1), with focus of-shore, some of which generates tsunami shows the interest of this region. In order to carry out detailed studies of seismicity and rupture process of these earthquakes is important to have a detailed crustal model. We have retrieved data from refraction and reflection seismic profiles done in the zone in the last 30 years. With this information we have obtained a 3D model for the SW Iberia (between 10.5ºW to 6ºW and 34.5ºN to 38.5ºN) formed by a grid of 0.5ºx0.5º in horizontal and 1 km interval in depth. To check the model we have relocated the 2007 (Mw=5.9) and 2009 (Mw=5.5) earthquakes occurred in this zone using the standard 2D model and the new 3D model. The results show a best depth resolution using the 3D model.",

            "abstract": "Interannual variation of heat balance in the Chukchi Sea in summer was investigated through analysis of satellite-derived sea-ice concentrations and reanalysis products during 1999–2010. The solar heat input varied from 4.3 to 8.0 × 1020 J over the Chukchi Sea defined in this study (5.9 × 105 km2). These values were larger than the heat transport from the Bering Strait ranging from 2.9 to 5.1 × 1020 J, suggesting that the Chukchi Sea was the area where the Pacific Water from the Bering Sea was strongly modified, affecting the interannual variation of the heat transport to the interior Arctic basin. Interannual variation in the latent, sensible, longwave radiation fluxes and the heat of fusion of sea ice in the Chukchi Sea are small compared with the heat transport from the Bering Strait as well as the solar heat input in the Chukchi Sea.",

            "abstract": "Smoke from biomass and peat burning has a notable impact on ambient air quality and climate in the Southeast Asia (SEA) region. We modeled the largest fire-induced haze episode in the past decade (2006) that originated in Indonesia using WRF-Chem. Our study addressed 3 research questions: (1) Can the WRF-Chem model reproduce observations of both aerosol and CO concentrations in this complex region? (2) What is the evolution in the chemical composition of the aerosol fire plume during its atmospheric transport? and (3) What is the relative contribution of these fires to air quality in the urbanized area of the city-state of Singapore?\nTo test model performance, we used three independent datasets for comparison (PM10 in Singapore, CO measurements in Sumatra, and AOD column observations from 4 satellite-based sensors). We found reasonable agreement of the model runs with ground-based measurements of both CO and PM10. However, the comparison with AOD was less favorable and indicated the model underestimated AOD. In the past, modeling studies using only AOD as a constraint have often boosted fire emissions to get a better agreement with observations. In our case, this approach would seriously deteriorate the difference with ground-based observations.\nFinally, our results show that about 21% of the total mass loading of ambient PM10 during the July–October study period in Singapore was due to the influence of biomass and peat burning in Sumatra, with an increased contribution during high burning periods. The composition of this biomass burning plume was largely dominated by primary organic carbon. In total, our model results indicated that during 35 days aerosol concentrations in Singapore were above the threshold of 50 μg m−3 day−1 (WHO threshold). During 17 days this deterioration was due to Indonesian fires, based on the difference between the simulations with and without fires. Local air pollution in combination with recirculation of air masses was probably the main cause of the lack of good air quality during the other 18 days. This finding is mostly due to the relatively fine scale of our model set-up; coarser resolution models would have likely attributed the increased aerosol loads to burning in Borneo from which plumes were advected close to Singapore, but did not contribute to local pollution according to our model.",

            "abstract": "Silicon isotopes are a powerful tool to investigate the cycling of dissolved silicon (Si). Here we present the stable Si isotope composition of dissolved silicic acid (δ30Si(OH)4) in the water column of the Eastern Equatorial Pacific (EEP) where one of the globally largest Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZs) is located. The samples were obtained during cruises with R/V Meteor in 2008/2009 and 2012/2013. Surface waters show a large range in δ30Si(OH)4 (+1.7‰ to +4.4‰). The samples with the highest δ30Si(OH)4 also revealed the most depleted Si(OH)4 concentrations (0.2 μmol/kg), which is a function of the high degree of Si utilization by diatoms and admixture of waters from highly productive areas. Samples within the OMZ at oxygen concentrations below 10 μmol/kg are characterized by a large range in δ30Si(OH)4, which mainly reflects advection and mixing of different water masses, even though the highly dynamic hydrographic system of the upwelling area off Peru does not allow the identification of unambiguous Si isotope signals of distinct water masses. Thus we cannot rule out that dissolution processes also influenced the δ30Si(OH)4 signature in the subsurface water column. Deep water masses (> 2000 m) in the study area show a mean δ30Si(OH)4 of +1.2 ± 0.2‰, which is in agreement with previous studies from the Eastern and Central Pacific. Comparison of the new deep water data of this study and previously published data from the Central Pacific and Southern Ocean reveal substantially higher δ30Si(OH)4 values than deep water signatures from the North Pacific. As there is no clear correlation between δ30Si(OH)4 and Si(OH)4 concentrations in the entire Pacific the distribution of δ30Si(OH)4 signatures in deep waters of the Pacific is considered to be a consequence of the mixing of several end member water masses with distinct Si isotope and Si concentration signatures.",

            "abstract": "Seasonal to decadal predictions are inevitably uncertain, depending on the size of the predictable signal relative to unpredictable chaos. Uncertainties can be accounted for using ensemble techniques, permitting quantitative probabilistic forecasts. In a perfect system, each ensemble member would represent a potential realization of the true evolution of the climate system, and the predictable components in models and reality would be equal. However, we show that the predictable component is sometimes lower in models than observations, especially for seasonal forecasts of the North Atlantic Oscillation and multi-year forecasts of North Atlantic temperature and pressure. In these cases the forecasts are under-confident, with each ensemble member containing too much noise. Consequently, most deterministic and probabilistic measures under-estimate potential skill and idealized model experiments under-estimate predictability. However, skilful and reliable predictions may be achieved using a large ensemble to reduce noise and adjusting the forecast variance through a post-processing technique proposed here.",

            "abstract": "Gravity waves (GWs) play an important role in the dynamics of the mesosphere/lower thermosphere (MLT) region, linking the lower to the upper atmosphere. GW filtering by the background zonal wind is furthermore believed to be the fundamental mechanism coupling the winter stratosphere to the summer polar mesopause, in which increased planetary wave (PW) activity in the former is related to enhanced temperatures in the latter through a chain of global MLT temperature anomalies. During major Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) the interaction between PWs and the background flow leads to increased polar stratospheric temperatures and a reversal of the climatological winds from eastward to westward. As a result, large changes in GW filtering conditions occur, making SSWs an excellent tool to empirically test the inter-hemispheric coupling mechanism.\nIn this study, mesopause GW forcing derived from meteor radar observations over Trondheim, Norway (63°N, 10°E) during the January 2013 major SSW is discussed in light of the polar vortex strength and selective filtering conditions over the same location to show the coupling between the polar winter stratosphere and MLT. Global temperature observations obtained with the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) are subsequently used to study the temperature signature of the SSW in the MLT region over the winter pole in relation to the observed GW forcing. Furthermore, the temperature effect of the SSW throughout the middle atmosphere is tracked, away from the winter pole toward the summer pole, and compared to the temperature structure expected from the inter-hemispheric coupling mechanism.",

            "abstract": "Communication is key to disaster risk management before, during and after a hazardous event occurs. In this study we used a participatory design approach to increase disaster preparedness levels around Turrialba volcano (Costa Rica) in collaboration with local communities.\nWe organised five participatory workshops in communities around Turrialba volcano, 2 in February 2014 and a further 3 in May 2014. A total of 101 people attended and participants included the general public, decision makers and relevant government employees. The main finding of the workshops was that people want more information, specifically regarding 1) the activity level at the volcano and 2) how to prepare. In addition, the source of information was identified as an important factor in communication, with credibility and integrity being key. This outcome highlights a communication gap between the communities at risk and the institutions monitoring the volcano, who publish their scientific results monthly.\nThis strong and explicitly expressed desire for more information should be acknowledged and responded to. However, this gives rise to the challenge of how to communicate: how to change the delivery and/or content of the messages already disseminated for greater effectiveness.\nIn our experience, participatory workshops provide a successful mechanism for effective communication. However, critically evaluating the workshops reveals a number of challenges and opportunities, with the former arising from human, cultural and resource factors, specifically the need to develop people’s capacity to participate, whereas the latter is predominantly represented by participant empowerment.\nAs disasters are mostly felt at individual, household and community levels, improving communication, not at but with these stakeholders, is an important component of a comprehensive disaster resilience strategy. This work provides an initial insight into the potential value of participatory design approaches for communication of hazard information.",

            "abstract": "The Tibetan Plateau is one of the most extreme cold regions in the world and a source of fresh water to 1.4 billion people. In this study, between 2008 and 2010, surface snow samples were retrieved in replicate from four high-elevation glaciers with an average elevation of 5200 m above sea level from the Tibetan Plateau and were analyzed for total Hg (HgT). The spatial distribution of Hg for glaciers and magnification processes of Hg in snow with increasing altitude over the Tibetan Plateau are investigated. The total Hg concentrations in snow samples ranged from <1 to 15 ng/L, with the highest concentrations at Mt. Muztagata, and the lowest concentrations at Mt. Nyainqêntanglha. This may be explained by the high concentration and annual flux of particulate matter deposition at Mt. Muztagata, the maximum from which particulate matter loads decrease from northwest to southeast over the Tibetan Plateau. Because Hg deposited on the plateau is primarily associated with particulate matter, only 31% of Hg was lost (e.g., reemitted back to the atmosphere) during the transition of fresh snow to coarse-grained snow. This demonstrates that Hg in snow over the Tibetan Plateau may be less influenced by the effect of post-depositional processes such as reemission and photoreduction than that in the Arctic. Moreover, the increases of HgT with increasing altitude (\"altitude effect\") found on four high-elevation glaciers (e.g., 3-fold in Mt. Muztagata) suggests that atmospheric Hg is cold-trapped and magnified toward low temperature and/or high-elevation regions, implying that the glaciers over the Tibetan Plateau play an important sink role for global Hg cycling. In the context of a warming climate, the Tibetan Plateau may shift from a current sink to a source in the future, and the accumulated Hg released by accelerated glacier thinning and retreat may endanger ecosystems and human health in the glacier-fed downstream regions.",

            "abstract": "The ChemCam LIBS instrument on the Curiosity rover has observed fluorine in more than 60 locations along the traverse. These are the first fluorine detections on Mars, although the SNC meteorites contain moderate amounts of F, suggesting that is present in the Mars crust. The detection limit is < 0.4 wt % but requires the simultaneous presence of Ca in the LIBS plasma (Gaft et al., 2014). Approximately one fourth of the observations were made on conglomerate clasts in the Bradbury Rise area near the landing site, and another third were made in sediments in the Kimberley area (around sol 550). In these targets F was correlated with K, Al, and Si enrichments; in the Kimberley area they were also correlated with Li enrichments in the 10s of ppm. The most likely mineral host in these settings is muscovite and potentially also biotite.\nIn other observations the fluorine is correlated with high Ca; P was observed above the relatively high LIBS detection limit in some targets, suggesting the presence of fluorapatites. Chlorine was not found in association with fluorine. A number of these observations were made in the rocks around the aeolian drift (around sol 60). The presence of the implied apatites and mica minerals has strong implications for the petrologic environment in which these phases were formed. We will discuss the origin and possible processes that led to the presence of these fluorine-bearing targets.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, concerns have grown over the potential impacts of climate change on electricity generation. Water resources are integral to the production of thermoelectric and hydroelectric power, and droughts are expected to become more frequent, severe, and longer-lasting over the course of the twenty-first century. Many generation technologies—including gas turbines and solar cells—are also vulnerable to changes in local climatic conditions like ambient air temperature. As extreme weather becomes more common, methods are needed to assess the impacts of climate change on regional power systems. However, these methods must also account for (1) heterogeneity in generation technologies, and (2) local variation in climatic conditions. This study uses a physically-based modeling system to assess the vulnerability of electric power infrastructure in the Western Interconnection. Climatic and hydrologic parameters relevant to power generation are identified for six generation technologies. Downscaled climate forcings are then used as inputs to a physically-based modeling system, consisting of the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model and the RBM one-dimensional stream temperature model. Impacts to generating capacity are estimated directly from changes in modeled climatic and hydrologic parameters, using functional relationships unique to each generating technology. A preliminary analysis of 1,302 power stations in the Western Interconnection reveals decreases in summertime generating capacity of 8-22%, with the largest impacts occurring at thermoelectric and hydroelectric facilities in the Pacific Northwest and California. Impacts to base-load thermoelectric plants are mitigated by recirculating cooling systems, which reduce the performance penalty of low flows and high water temperatures. Climate impacts on solar and wind capacity are relatively small, indicating that these energy sources may play a more prominent role as conventional generation sources become less reliable.",

            "abstract": "Subduction of hydrous phases enables the transport of water into the typically anhydrous mantle. Dehydration of these phases has a dramatic expression at the Earth’s surface in the form of earthquakes and arc volcanism. Within a subduction zone, talc (Mg3Si4O10(OH)2) is found within the hydrothermally altered oceanic crust and pelagic sediments of the subducting slab, as well as the metasomatised mantle wedge. The 10 Å phase (Mg3Si4O10(OH)2.H2O) forms from the breakdown of talc at low temperatures and pressures above 5 GPa, and is thought to be stable to depths up to 200 km1. Previous work has focused on the stability of Mg end-members of talc and the 10 Å phase. However, natural samples of talc show deviation from end member composition, most significantly in the substitution of iron for magnesium. It is likely that the stability of iron-bearing talc and its high pressure equivalent, the 10 Å phase, will differ from that of Mg end-member compositions, as demonstrated by previous studies examining the effect of solid solution in phyllosilicates such as antigorite. High pressure experiments using the multi-anvil press at the University of Manchester have bracketed the reaction talc + H2O = 10 Å phase for Mg end-member compositions. Samples of iron-bearing talc and the 10 Å phase have been synthesised at pressures of 2 GPa and 6.2 GPa, respectively. By performing phase equilibrium experiments on iron-bearing talc and 10 Å phase it is possible to quantify the effect of composition on the position of the reaction talc + H2O = 10 Å phase, as well the thermal breakdown of the 10 Å phase to enstatite and coesite. Univarient breakdown reactions assume that the 10 Å dehydrates at one discrete depth, where the thermal stability has been exceeded. The results are expected to show that instead, fluid release from 10 Å phase dehydration is more likely to occur over a range of depths during subduction, dependant on the bulk composition and the thermal regime of the subduction zone.\n1.

            "abstract": "The interseismic recovery of frictional strength is a fundamental part of the seismic cycle. This restrengthening, and related phenomena, plays a key role in determining the stability and mode of tectonic faulting. Recent experimental data has shown that gouge mineralogy has a strong influence on the rate of frictional healing, with calcite-dominated gouges showing the highest rates. Combining these data with widespread observations of calcite as cement or veins in non-carbonate hosted faults, indicates that the presence of calcite within a fault gouge could play an important role in shallow- and mid-crustal earthquakes.\nWe report on laboratory experiments designed to explore the mechanical behavior of quartz/calcite mixtures as a means to better understand the evolution of fault behavior in faults where carbonate materials are present. We sheared mixtures of powdered Carrara marble (>98% CaCO3) and disaggregated Ottawa sand (99.8% SiO2) at constant normal stress of 5 MPa under saturated conditions at room temperature. We performed slide-hold-slide tests, 1-3,000 seconds, and velocity stepping tests, 0.1-1000 µm/s, to measure the amount of frictional healing and velocity dependence of friction respectively. Small subsets of experiments were conducted at different boundary conditions.\nPreliminary results show that the presence of calcite in quartz-based fault gouge has a hardening effect, both in overall frictional strength, where the strength of our mixtures increases with increasing calcite content, and in single experiments, where mixtures with low percentages of calcite show a consistent strain-hardening trend. We also observe that the rates of frictional healing and creep relaxation increase with increasing calcite content. Finally, our results show that the addition of as little as 2.5% calcite within a fault gouge results in a 30% increase in the rate of frictional healing, with further increases in calcite content resulting in larger increases in the rate of healing.\nCombined with our previous work, our results show that the presence of calcite in fault gouge can lead to accelerated frictional healing and velocity-weakening frictional behavior, favoring seismicity at shallow crustal conditions where faults are thought to fail mostly by aseismic creep.",

            "abstract": "Coastal flooding is the result of the non-linear interaction of multiple oceanographic, hydrological, geological and meteorological forcings (i.e., astronomical tide, monthly mean sea level, large-scale storm surge, wave set-up, wind set-up, fluvial discharges, precipitation, subsidence). Additionally, interannual variability and trends in storminess and sea level rise are climate drivers that must be considered. In many cases, some of the factors can be neglected, resulting in a relatively manageable problem from a hydrodynamic and statistical point of view. However, the contribution of each component of total water levels in San Franciso Bay (SFB) can significantly alter spatially varying flood hazards, resulting in an extraordinarily complex problem when it comes to determination of the extreme value distribution of flooding extents. The problem is even more difficult if we want to project coastal flooding risk for different climate change scenarios.\nTo address this ‘wonderful problem’, we propose a hybrid approach that combines: (a) hydrodynamic models (WWIII for waves, statistically or dynamically downscaled winds, Delft3D for high resolution tide-surge-wave modeling); (b) long-term data bases (observational and hindcast); and (c) non-linear data mining and statistical downscaling methods. At monthly scales, variability is driven by astronomic tides (perigean and nodal cycles) and the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). At a daily scale, sea level pressure fields are the predictors of wind, waves and surge levels. The statistical downscaling models are based on circulation patterns for multivariate variables (Espejo et al., 2014) and on extremes (Izaguirre et al, 2012), resulting in a time-dependent climate emulators which define the hydraulic boundary conditions for Delft3D.\n",

            "abstract": "The western North Pacific to the east of Japan is one of the regions where sea-level rise is predicted to the larger than the global mean in CMIP5 models as shown in IPCC AR5. One of the causes of the spatial variations of the sea-level is change in ocean circulation, and this effect can be important in western boundary regions, where changes of strong western boundary current can cause large sea-level changes. However, the current climate models cannot properly represent western boundary currents due to coarse model resolution. Therefore, it is desirable to perform downscaling of future sea-level changes using a regional ocean model with a high model resolution for western boundary current regions using forcings and boundary conditions taken from climate model outputs.\nThis study investigates future regional sea-level rise by performing dynamical downscaling in the western North Pacific, using the regional ocean model system (ROMS) with eddy-permitting 0.25-degree resolution over the North Pacific. In order to evaluate possible extremely large regional sea-level rise, the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate Earth System Model (MIROC-ESM) under RCP8.5 scenario is chosen because this model exhibits large sea-level rise among CMIP5 models in this region. ROMS are run for two epochs; one is 1950-2000 and the other is 2051-2100, and the last 20-years are analyzed. The model integration is now ongoing, and the major differences between the two runs will be reported at the meeting.",

Understanding and measuring dynamics becomes a prerequisite for companies, governments, agencies, NGO’s, research institutes and society in general. In many of these cases the temporal frequency of the information is a clear requirement to detect phenomena that can occur within a few days (related to crops, forests and other ecosystems) and at a certain geographic scale. For example frequent updates on crop condition and production is needed to stabilize agricultural markets. This is already being picked up by large initiatives like the GEOGLAM AMIS system.\nObservations over large areas are available through satellites, however challenges remain;\non the one hand side obtaining frequent and consistent observations at sufficient level of detail to identify spatial phenomena. At present, no single mission is capable of providing near daily information of any place in the world at scales in which changes in land cover/use can be identified in a consistent manner.\nOn the other hand side the need for a historical reference. For agricultural monitoring and early warning purposes the comparison of the actual data with the historical reference is of the utmost importance.\nThe Proba-V mission is a first attempt to overcome these challenges. From its design and within the GIO-Global Land component a lot of work has been done to ensure the integration of the Proba-V data with the 15 years historical archive of SPOT-VEGETATION. In this respect Proba-V observation will be intercomparable with the SPOT-VGT historical baseline which will ensure the continuation of the standard agricultural monitoring products. Next to this integration with the historical archive, Proba-V also ensures an increase in spatial resolution of the data sets, from 1km to 300m and even 100m (with some loss in the temporal domain).\nWithin the framework of the FP7 SIGMA project, currently Europe’s largest contribution to the abovementioned GEOGLAM initiative, we have been looking at the use of this 100m data set for agricultural monitoring.\nResults of this study will be presented here.",

Despite intensive research, the relationship of the belt with surrounding Archean granitoid-dominated bedrock has remained ambiguous. To approach this problem and to characterize the volcano-sedimentary evolution of the TGB we have performed new U–Pb single-grain zircon dating of felsic-intermediate volcanic rocks and sedimentary rocks by applying SIMS, as well as produced new geochemical analyses from the selected key locations.\nThe new results show that there are at least three different age groups of felsic-intermediate volcanic rocks in the TGB: 2.84 Ga, 2.82 Ga, and 2.80 Ga. The oldest volcanic rocks predate the oldest dated unmigmatised granitoidic rocks in the immediate vicinity of the TGB, and thus the depositional basement for these volcanic rocks is still unknown. The second volcanic event coevals with some of the plutonic rocks, which are thus likely to be related to this volcanic phase. The 2.80 Ga Koivumäki Formation, containing Ag-Zn-Pb-Au mineralization, is the youngest of these volcanic episodes, contrary to what has previously been suggested. The results of detrital zircons from the sedimentary rocks from the TGB indicate that they were deposited at least 40 Myr after the youngest known volcanic rocks. The sedimentary rocks have heterogeneous sources and contain >3.0 Ga crustal material.\nThe volcanic evolution of the TGB resembles, e.g., the evolution of the Archean ca. 2897–2744 Ma Island Lake greenstone belt (within the Superior Province in Canada) that is also characterized by multiphase volcanism and the presence of contemporaneous plutonic and volcanic rock units. Unlike in the case of the TGB, however, the depositional basement for the oldest volcanic rocks of the Island Lake greenstone belt has been recognized.",

            "abstract": "We present the current state of the ‘Comprehensive Earth Model’ (CEM), a solver-independent multi-scale model of the global distribution of density and visco-elastic parameters. The overall goal of this project is to produce a model that represents the Earth on all seismically accessible scales; which contains high resolution sub-models where data and computational concerns allow, and which presents a low wavenumber Earth in regions yet to be probed in detail. To accomplish this, we have designed the model to be independent of any particular forward solver. This allows the usage of a wide variety of forward and inverse techniques, each of which may contribute updates within their respective regimes of validity.\nIn order for these updates to be included in future releases of the CEM, they must satisfy a global reference dataset. This dataset is currently being constructed, drawing from waveform, traveltime, and normal mode catalogues, and incorporating both earthquake and ambient noise sources.\nTo support future multiscale inversions, we report on methodological developments surrounding the project, including specific interfaces with forward solvers and a suite of tools for processing gradient-based model updates. Advances in forward modelling codes, such as the porting of the spectral element solver SPECFEM3D to heterogeneous computing clusters, allows for the efficient and fully numerical calculation of sensitivity kernels on the global scale. Taking advantage of these developments, we present a global-scale transversely isotropic mantle-and-crust update to the CEM, with a misfit criterion based on waveform phase differences, and iterative nonlinear model perturbations found via adjoint techniques. Additionally, regional scale updates from both traveltime and waveform tomography are presented and discussed.\nAn open source software package has been developed, which aims to ease the processing of model updates, and which exists independently from any particular forward solver. By interpolating sensitivity kernels onto an external, regular grid, a generic collection of processing and smoothing techniques are used. This flexibility allows the package to be included in a variety of inversion workflows, from regional scale traveltime tomographies, to global scale full waveform inversions.",

            "abstract": "Over the years the framework of GIA modelling has been subject to continuous improvements, e.g. the addition of time dependent coastal margins and rotational feedback. The latest addition to this framework is the incorporation of sediment as a time-varying surface load while accounting for sea-level variations associated with the sediment transport (Dalca et al., GJI 2013). The effects of sediment loading during a glacial cycle have not been extensively investigated even though it is known that large sediment transport took place, for example in the Barents Sea region and Fennoscandia. This study investigates the effect of sediment transport on relative sea level change and present-day rates of gravity and vertical deformation in those regions.\nWhile the ice sheet history during the last glacial period has been modelled extensively there are no full-scale models of paleo-erosion and –deposition rates for regions such as Fennoscandia. Here we create end-member paleo-sedimentary models by combining geological observations of continuous erosion and deposition and large scale failure events. These models, in combination with the ICE-5G ice sheet history, serve as an input for a GIA model for a spherically symmetric incompressible Earth with the full sea-level equation.\nThe results from this model, i.e. (rates of) relative sea level change and crustal deformation, are obtained for different viscosity models fitting best with the local rheology of Fennoscandia. By comparing GPS measurements, GRACE observations and relative sea level records with these modelled predictions the effects of sedimentary isostasy in the Fennoscandian region are studied. The sediment load does not significantly affect the modelled relative sea level curves, nor vertical deformation rates at the location of GPS measurements. However, gravity rates over the Barents Sea region are influenced significantly",

            "abstract": "For centuries estuarine systems have been losing portions of their natural domain as a consequence of human actions. In the past, estuaries were perceived as sources of disease, often drained or heavily engineered. Our current understanding shows that estuaries are instead rich ecosystems that need to be restored to their natural state. However, returning these areas into the tidal system may cause morphological changes on its present behavior. For this reason, it is important to understand, and attempt to predict, what morphodynamic changes an estuarine system may experience due to different restoration actions.\nIn order to drain and use portions of the estuary, dikes are often built to disconnect them from the estuary. In this work we focus our attention on the restoration of these areas and specifically on dike removal. Dikes may be totally or partially removed to allow the tidal flow to enter into the area being restored. Morphodynamic effects of dike removal are computed numerically using Delft3d. Different dike removal configurations are studied and their effect on the recovery of the estuary quantified computing the probability distribution of drainage area and drainage volume. Tidal network characterization is carried out using a new approach that considers spatial hydrodynamic fields during a complete tidal cycle. Connectivity is thus allowed to evolve with time. The impact of different restorations strategies in the drainage area and volume of the network has been studied in the short term (5 -10 years) and in the long term (100 years).\nResults show the differences in tidal network characteristics after different dike removal actions for different scenarios. These differences are quantified with the new approach, allowing to highlight the changes that induce deep behavioral change in the system. The importance of sea level rise in these behavioral changes is also assessed in the study.",

            "abstract": "Microbial sulfate reduction and coupled anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) are the dominant biogeochemical processes occurring at cold seeps in marine settings. These processes not only support the growth of chemosynthetic communities but also promote the precipitation of authigenic carbonates. However, investigations of microbial sulfate reduction have been conducted only using porewaters or seep-related barites. The fact is that many seeps are either inactive or do not precipitate any barite minerals. Thus, little is known about the microbial sulfate reduction at these seep environments. The occurrence of authigenic carbonate has been documented at almost all cold seep sites, which provide a unique opportunity to investigate the microbial sulfate reduction using such carbonate. The presentation is focused on the concentrations and isotopic signatures of carbonate associated sulfate (CAS). The aim of the project is to determine the role of sulfate and sulfate reduction during carbonate precipitation at cold seeps. The CAS concentrations are 67-537 ppm in high-Mg calcite, 51-181 ppm in low-Mg calcite, and 116-565 in aragonite. The δ34SCAS and δ18OCAS also vary considerably, ranging from 21.9‰ to 56.2‰ (V-CDT) and from 10.1‰ to 24.8‰ (V-SMOW), respectively. On δ34SCAS versus δ18OCAS plots, both aragonite and calcite show linear trends that project down toward those of open seawater sulfate. The trends suggest that sulfate has been isotopically modified to various degrees in pore fluids before being incorporated into carbonate lattice. The much narrower δ34SCAS and δ18OCAS ranges for aragonite than for calcite suggests a much “pickier” condition for aragonite formation during early diagenesis. Our results suggest that concentration and isotopic composition of CAS in seep carbonates may be controlled by the supply of pore-water sulfate during carbonate precipitation. The reliability of CAS in carbonate of early diagenetic origin as a proxy of contemporaneous seawater sulfate is therefore questioned.\nAcknowledgment: This study was partially supported by NSFC (41373085).",

            "abstract": "Analysis of oxygen dayglow emissions at OI 557.7, OI 630.0, and OI 777.4 nm showed that the wave dynamical vertical coupling of atmospheres is solar activity dependent. These emission intensities are obtained during January-March in the years 2011 and 2012 from Hyderabad (17.5oN, 78.5oE), India, using a high-spectral resolution multi-wavelength imaging echelle spectrograph (MISE). Spectral analysis of the variations revealed that oscillation periods near the atmospheric free-normal modes of 5, 10, 16, and 25 days (that are produced mainly in the troposphere) are found to register their presence in the upper atmospheric emission intensities. In an earlier study during high solar activity period (2001), the sunspot numbers (SSN) and the daily averaged OI 630.0 nm dayglow intensities were seen to be co-varying. In contrast, the variability in the dayglow emission intensities during relatively low solar activity period (2011) shows no or weaker correlation with that of the SSN but a greater similarity with that of the equatorial electrojet (EEJ) strength. Whereas, oscillations of both lower atmospheric normal modes and those related to sunspot are found during moderate solar activity (2012). These results suggest that the upper atmosphere responds mainly to lower atmospheric forcing during low solar activity, to solar forcing during high solar activity, and to both lower atmosphere and solar forcings during moderate solar activity level. A statistical study of the shorter period variations in the gravity wave regime showed they are present in greater numbers in the thermosphere during higher solar activity, which is ascribed to be due to decreasing wave dissipation with increasing solar activity. These results will be presented in the context of short- and long-period wave dynamics in the whole atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Rapid urbanization and land use changes in areas along Laguna de Bay, one of the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia, have resulted in increased economic activities and demand for groundwater resources from households, commerce and industries. One significant activity that can affect groundwater is the development of the water resorts industry, which includes hot springs spas. This study aims to determine the impact of the proliferation of these water resorts in Calamba and Los Banos, urban areas located at the southern coast of the lake on the groundwater as a resource. Calamba, being the “Hot Spring Capital of the Philippines”, presently has more than 300 resorts, while Los Banos has at least 38 resorts. Results from an initial survey of resorts show that the swimming pools are drained/ changed on an average of 2-3 times a week or even daily during peak periods of tourist arrivals. This indicates a large demand on the groundwater. Monitoring of actual groundwater extraction is a challenge however, as most of these resorts operate without water use permits. The unrestrained exploitation of groundwater has resulted to drying up of older wells and decrease in hot spring water temperature. It is necessary to strengthen implementation of laws and policies, and enhance partnerships among government, private sector groups, civil society and communities to promote groundwater sustainability.",

            "abstract": "Reactive nitrogen (N) is a ubiquitous freshwater pollutant, but generating accurate catchment-scale measurements of its fate and transport remains elusive. Advances N isotope systematics and the detection of microbial populations provide potentially promising avenues for developing sensitive indicators of in-situ transformations. However, the use of isotopes in terrestrial systems is currently limited by difficulty in distinguishing variations in fractionation from source mixing, while relationships between microbial indicators and fluxes are inconsistent. Hypothesizing that these issues could be overcome by linking the two approaches across hydrologic flux data, we set out to develop an analytical framework for identifying where and how N is attenuated in cryptic groundwater systems.\nVariations in the isotopic composition of ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate and the genes associated with their oxidation/ reduction were measured in 50 wells distributed longitudinally across an ammonium plume (from 130 to 0 mg N l-1) three times over 12 months. Net isoflux calculations revealed the seasonal development of N attenuation hotspots along the plume fringe. The broad correlation of these hotspots with redox transition zones and ammonia oxidizing and nitrite reducing gene abundances corroborated the traditional view of N removal via coupled nitrification-denitrification. It was thus surprising that the relationships between the dual isotope ratios of nitrate and nitrite were not consistent with denitrification in two hotspots. Combining indicators, we found strong empirical proof that attenuation in these zones was driven by seasonal anaerobic ammonium oxidation: both zones had high relative and absolute abundance of nitrite reducing and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing genes alongside high δ18Onitriteand nitrite concentrations.\nThe development and handling of this unique data set provides a practical template for up-scaling process level information to the whole aquifer by integrating variations in nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium isotopic composition. The outcomes emphasize the need for high spatial and temporal resolution data in order to accurately assess groundwater N cycling.",

The study developed the model in a watershed in southern Taiwan, by using landslide inventories prepared after eight historical typhoon events (2001-2008). The study then tested iLIR-w by incorporating typhoon rainfall forecasts from the Taiwan Cooperative Precipitation Ensemble Forecast Experiment (TAPEX) to practice landslide hazard early warning of 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h before the arrival of Typhoon Morakot which seriously damaged Southern Taiwan in 2009. The model performs reasonably well in the prediction of landslide locations, timing and runouts.

Although magma mixing between mafic and silicic magmas is regarded as a major differentiation process, documentation of the mechanisms acting in melt interaction, both in its physical and chemical aspects, is still incomplete. We present the first Raman spectroscopic investigation of the products of magma-mixing experiments performed using natural basaltic and rhyolitic melts from the Yellowstone Norris-Mammoth Corridor. The mixing process is driven by a recently-developed apparatus that generates chaotic streamlines in the melts, mimicking the development of magma mixing in nature. The chemical variation of major elements is studied in detail by electron microprobe (EMPA) on mixed filaments of 1000 µm diameter. Raman and microprobe measurements have been performed every 10 µm this allow us to investigate the evolution of silicate structure, from the rhyolitic to the basaltic composition. Deconvoluted Raman spectra collected from the mixed experiment yield information about network-forming structural units (Qn species, where n indicates the number of bridging oxygen). By combining Raman spectra and chemical analyses we show, for the first time, how the percent of Qn species evolve with chemical composition in these natural silicate melts. Moreover, our results show how the ratio of network modifiers respect to network former cations, dramatically affects the Raman spectra of the rhyolitic end-member.",

            "abstract": "Iran is one of the most rapidly deforming zones of active continental convergence, and a large and growing population within the country is exposed to high seismic hazard. However, despite the region’s tectonic importance, the force balance responsible for Iran’s large-scale deformation field is not well understood. Previous continuum deformation models for Iran suggest that lateral variations in lithospheric strength are necessary to account for the non-deforming region of Central Iran, but these studies were undertaken before the availability of a GPS velocity field against which to compare such models.\nHere we use a physical model that treats the Iranian lithosphere as a thin sheet of viscous material overlying an inviscid substrate. We find that the GPS velocity field is well described by such a continuum model with homogeneous properties. Contrary to the suggestions of previous studies, we find that an anomalously strong Central Iran is not required to match the strain-rate field. Instead, this distribution of deformation can be replicated by considering buoyancy forces acting in the lithosphere. We also find that overthrusting of South Caspian oceanic lithosphere by Iranian continental lithosphere in the Talesh mountains plays an important role in determining local kinematics in NW Iran. Finally, we develop a novel method for estimating seismic hazard where velocity measurements are sparse. We assume that the motion of upper crustal blocks conforms to the velocity field derived from our dynamical calculations, and allow the geometry of blocks to be specified from geological considerations. We then solve for the Euler rotation vector for each block that best fits our model velocities. We use these rotation vectors to derive fault slip rates along block boundaries, and find that our predicted rates agree well with independent Quaternary and geological estimates.",

            "abstract": "The Taiwan orogenic belt, located in Southeastern Asia, is under monsoon\nclimate, frequently attacked by tropical typhoons, and characterized by rapid\ntectonic uplift with high seismicity. Researchers have been linking the Taiwan’s\nlandscapes to active tectonic uplift. In this study, we show the significance of\nglacial/interglacial climate changes in shaping the landscapes. We focus on the\nmountain areas that have never been glaciated. Based on >400 radiocarbon\ndates (70 of which >12 ka), we find that both the slope and fluvial activities\nwere generally low during the glacial time. Still, extensive alluviation had\noccurred at certain time periods, forming large debris slopes or alluvial fans\n(typically along mountain fronts), and causing significant aggradation along\nsome major rivers. In contrast, with numerous landslides and debris flows, river\nincision has dominated during the postglacial time. Episodic river aggradation\nwith alluvial-terrace development (typically at tributary mouths) also occurred\nduring this time period, but was less extensive than previously. Some huge\npostglacial alluvial terraces have been proved sourced from the colluviums\ndeposited in the glacial time. We attribute the low landscape activities of the\nglacial period to the dryness during the period. However, even in this time\nrare but severe rainfall events must have occurred to trigger some extensive\nalluviation. In contrast, the increase in both rainfall and typhoon frequency\nduring the postglacial time drastically increased the slope instability and\nsediment yield. The great stream power, along with the sufficient coarse debris\nacting as erosion tools, ensured the rapid river incision during this time.",

            "abstract": "Abrupt climate change is a prominent feature of the ice ages. The prevailing view is that these changes are related to fluctuations in ocean circulation, possibly triggered by changes in freshwater forcing as a result of ice-rafting events in the North Atlantic. Here we investigate this view by presenting results from a sediment core in the Northern North Atlantic (ODP 983 60.4°N, 23.6°W, 1984m depth, ~12-35 kyr), which is ideally positioned to monitor changes in the flow speed of Iceland-Scotland Overflow Waters. The mean size of silt (10-63 μm) has been proposed as a useful flow speed indicator, but can be influenced the presence of ice-rafted detritus (IRD). We present grain size data obtained using a Coulter counter as well as a laser diffraction particle sizer, which we compare to the proportion of Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (proxy for sea surface temperature) and manually counted coarse IRD. Grain size results are comparable for the two techniques and the influence of IRD is clearly visible in the mean size data. We use end-member modelling to derive an IRD-free estimate of flow speed variability and find clear reductions in the flow speed associated with IRD input. Sea surface temperature however, appears to vary independently from IRD input and hence deep circulation. In particular, IRD appears and current speed decreases after the onset of cooling and additional temperature variability is observed that is not associated with IRD events or changes in the deep circulation. These results question the classical view of freshwater forcing as the driver of abrupt climate change. We suggest that North Atlantic temperature variability may be related to shifts in position of the polar front and that, while IRD events may be coeval with changes in the deep circulation, these changes are not required to explain the abrupt temperature variability in the Northern North Atlantic.",

            "abstract": "The River Wda valley is a classical example of a polygenetic valley, consisting of former lake basins joined by erosive gap sections. In its middle section, which was the subject of our research, a fragment of an abandoned Lateglacial river valley is preserved, which is unique for the Weichselian moraine belt in the Central European Lowlands. The analysis of the relationship between the lacustrine and fluvial sediments and landforms enabled the authors to report many evolutionary connections between the initial period of the river system formation and the emergence of lakes during the Weichselian Lateglacial. The surface drainage essentially determined the progress of melting of dead ice blocks buried in the glacial depressions, which finally led to lake formation there. Most of the lake basins in the study area were formed during the Bølling-Allerød period. However, one section of the subglacial channel was not exposed to the thermokarst conditions and was therefore preserved with dead ice blocks throughout the entire Lateglacial. The dead ice decay at the beginning of the Holocene, as well as the emergence of another lake, created a lower base level of erosion in the close vicinity of the abandoned valley and induced a change of the river's course. Both fluvial and lacustrine deposits and landforms distributed in the central section of the River Wda valley indicate two processes, which proceeded simultaneously: (1) emergence of fluvially joined lake basins within a glacial channel, (2) degradation of the river bed in the gap sections interfering between the lakes. The processes described for the central section of the River Wda channel indicate a very dynamic river valley development during the Weichselian Lateglacial and the early Holocene. The valley formation was tightly interwoven with the morphogenesis of the primary basins within the valley, mainly with the melting of the buried blocks of dead ice and the development of lakes.

            "abstract": "About three thousand years ago, Sanxingdui Civilization in Sichuan, China suddenly disappeared in its flourishing stage, following by a new Civilization called Jinsha locates about 40 kilometers southwest of Sanxingdui. The previous reasons such as flood or war was not so convincing to explain the sudden extinction of Sanxingdui and the heritage of Jinsha. Nevertheless, no sufficient attention has been paid to the special geomorphologic characters of Yanmen Ravine (a tributary of Minjiang River), Jianjiang River and Baishui River (a tributary of Jianjiang River), either. Based on field investigation conducted in the relevant areas, in addition with 3S (Remote Sensing RS, Geographical information System GIS and Global Positioning System GPS) technologies, it is found that Yanmen Ravine, Baishui River and Jianjiang River (all are bed rock rivers) are too wide in according with the small flow discharge. Some cirques locate in high areas of Mount Gauangguang, which is the divide of the current Yanmen Ravine and Baishui River, but no cirques exist near the proposed old channel. As a result, it proves that Baishui River and Jianjiang River are beheaded rivers and Yanmen Ravine is a reversed river. All the demonstrations above prove that Minjiang River used to flow southeast into Tuojiang River through Mount Guangguang along Baishui River and Jianjiang River. The profiles of Minjing River, Zagunao River, Yanmen Ravine and Wenzheng Ravine also demonstrate that river capture once happened. Combining historic records and archaeological materials, it is concluded that a strong earthquake happened in 1099B.C. triggered rock avalanches and landslides, the old Minjiang River was dammed in Mount Guangguang and river capture happened. The avulsion of river resulted in sharp decreasing of the flow discharge of the river flowing by Sanxingdui Civilization. As a result, for the short of water resources, Sanxingdui Civilization was forced to migrate and finally found the big river in Jinsha, where the new river flowed by, and thus a new civilization developed. River capture also caused the serious floods in Duyu Kingdom Periods.",

            "abstract": "The launch of Sentinel-1A on 3 April 2014 by the European Space Agency will transform our ability to monitor our restless planet with InSAR. For the first time, radar data will be acquired systematically and frequently (every 6 days once Sentinel-1B is launched in 2016) over all the tectonic and volcanic areas of the planet; the data will be freely available to the whole community; the mission has a long duration, with future launches planned to extend the time series to at least 20 years. In this presentation, I will discuss some the processing challenges, present preliminary differential interferograms and time series, and speculatively look back from 2034 on what the mission has achieved.\nSentinel-1 acquires radar data in a novel mode, known as Interferometric Wide Swath or TOPS (Terrain Observation with Progressive Scans in azimuth) mode. TOPS mode has some advantages, the most significant of which is that a 250 km wide image can be acquired without the scalloping effect that is seen in conventional ScanSAR amplitude images. However, because the Doppler centroid varies in azimuth, phase artefacts are introduced in TOPS-mode interferograms unless the images are co-registered with an azimuth accuracy of ~5 cm. This, and the bursted nature of TOPS data, introduces new challenges and opportunities to InSAR processing. We show how the required coregistration accuracy can be achieved with an end-to-end geometric approach, and by exploitation of the view angle diversity in burst and swath overlap regions. We also discuss different strategies for when and how to stitch the bursts, which depend on the application domain and processing methodology.\nThe systematic acquisitions and free and open data policy provide new opportunities for routine analysis and operational applications of InSAR. COMET (* http://comet.nerc.ac.uk) aims to provide processed results for all the tectonic and volcanic regions of the planet, and we will present preliminary results of our processing system from test regions in Turkey and Mexico. By 2034, there will be a 20 year archive of systematic radar acquisitions from the Sentinel-1 program. We will end this presentation with a speculative view from 2034 on the main achievements of the program.\n*COMET is the UK NERC's Centre for the Observation and Modelling of Earthquakes, Volcanoes and Tectonics.",

In the present study, the water environmental capacities as indicated by the changing landscapes in the greater Jakarta basins were investigated to understand the role of land use management and its impact on water resources, ecosystem and environmental services. The Ciliwung river basin where rapid population increases and progresses of the land use/cover changes occurring was selected as a representative basin, and 41 water samplings were taken at different time of Jan. 08, Apr. 08, Jul. 08, and Oct. 08 during 2009 to understand the effect of rainfall variation on water quality, and clarify the characteristics of hydrological cycle. Landuse changes of the upper basins as can be seen for the upper basin indicated the expansion of settlements during 1990 to 2004 from 4.1% to 17.6% or in acreage increased almost five times, not only converting forested area, but mostly taking place from paddy fields that contributed about 50% of the additional land for new settlements. Urbanization expanding around the greater Jakarta basins, is closely related to the increased fluctuations of river discharges in recent years, with recurrence floods quickly after heavy rainfall events. Furthermore, the study results indicated that water quality of Ciliwung river, especially the loading concentrations of nitric acid closely reflects the population densities of the watershed. These results suggest that the land use/cover changes of the greater Jakarta basins affect largely the change of water environment of the areas and resulting a deteriorated factor for water resources, ecosystems and environmental services in both of quantity and quality",

Oldoinyo Lengai, which located near the seismicity, began to erupt effusively before about a month later, and increased eruption intensity on September when the swarm almost ceased. The explosive eruption continued until April 2008.\nCalais et al. (2008), Baer et al. (2008), and Biggs et al. (2009) have already reported the deformation associated with the swarm using InSAR. However, they mainly used ENVISAT/ASAR(C-band) images and only used images acquired from descending pass. We use both ascending and descending passes of ALOS/PALSAR (L-band) images. In addition to InSAR data, we also employ the offset-tracking technique to detect the signals along the azimuth direction. Using InSAR and offset-tracking, we could obtain the full 3D displacement field associated with the swarm.\nThe inferred full 3D displacement indicates that the graben-like-subsiding zone was horizontally moving by ~48cm toward SSW. To our knowledge, the horizontal movement at the subsidence zone has never been identified. To explain the displacement, we performed the fault source modeling. The fault slip distribution indicates that the ratio of strike slip component is about 30% of total moment release. Aseismic strike-slip creep motion might have also been responsible for the horizontal motion area and the swarm activity.",

            "abstract": "We developed an inversion method to estimate the evolution of pore fluid pressure fields from earthquake focal mechanism solutions based on the Bayesian statistical inference and Akaike’s Bayesian information criterion (ABIC). This method’s application to induced seismicity in the Basel enhanced geothermal system in Switzerland shows the evolution of pore fluid pressures in response to fluid injection experiments. For a few days following the initiation of the fluid injection, overpressurized fluids are concentrated around the borehole and then anisotropically propagate within the reservoir until the bleed-off time. Then, the pore fluid pressure in the vicinity of the borehole drastically decreases, and overpressurized fluids become isolated in a few major fluid pockets. The pore fluid pressure in these pockets gradually decreases with time. The pore fluid pressure in the reservoir is less than the minimum principal stress at each depth, indicating that the hydraulic fracturing did not occur during stimulation. This suggests that seismic events may play an important role to promote the development of permeable channels, particularly southeast of the borehole where the largest seismic event (ML 3.4) occurred. This is not directly related to a drastic decrease in fault strength at the hypocenter, but rather the positive feedback between permeability enhancement and poro-elastic and stress transfer loading from slipping interfaces. These processes likely contribute to this event’s nucleation.",

Large scale motion of a conducting medium shearing pre-existing magnetic field lines is a well known process to produce large scale magnetic field by omega-effect. However, such a process cannot sustain a self-excited dynamo and small-scale turbulent motions are usually invoked as the appropriate mechanism to dynamo action.\nThe contribution of turbulent fluctuations to the induction of mean magnetic field is investigated in our liquid sodium spherical Couette experiment, with an imposed magnetic field. Many measurements are used through an inversion technique to obtain a radial profile of alpha and beta effects together with the mean flow at magnetic Reynolds number Rm = 100.\nIt appears that the small scale turbulent fluctuations can be modeled as a strong contribution to the magnetic diffusivity which is negative in the interior region and positive close to the outer shell.Direct numerical simulations of our experiment support these results. The lowering of the effective magnetic diffusivity by small scale fluctuations implies that turbulence can actually help to achieve self-generation of large scale magnetic fields.",

Among the different approach proposed to discern transient anomalous signals possibly associated to seismic activity from normal TIR signal fluctuations (i.e. related to the change of natural factor and/or observation conditions), since 2001 the Robust Satellite Techniques (RST) were used to investigate tens of earthquakes with a wide range of magnitudes (from 4.0 to 7.9) occurred in different continents and in various geo-tectonic setting (e.g. Athens earthquake, 7 September 1999; Abruzzo earthquake, 6 April 2009, etc.).\nThe RST approach gives a statistically - based definition of “TIR anomalies” and offers a suitable method for their identification even in very different local (e.g. related to atmosphere and/or surface) and observational (e.g. related to time/season, but also to solar and satellite zenithal angles) conditions. It has been always carried out by using a validation/confutation approach, to verify the presence/absence of anomalous space-time TIR transients in the presence/absence of seismic activity.\nIn this paper, the RST approach is extensively implemented on 10 years of TIR satellite records collected by the geostationary satellite sensor MSG/SEVIRI over the Greece region. The results of the analysis performed to investigate possible correlations (within predefined space-time windows) of anomalous TIR transients with time and place of occurrence of earthquakes with M>4 will be discussed in terms of reliability and effectiveness also in the perspective of a time-Dependent Assessment of Seismic Hazard (t-DASH) system.",

Silicon, geochemically abundant, has long been considered as a major potential light element in the Earth’s outer core because of its high solubility in iron, iron-silicate interactions at core-mantle boundary, the Si isotope data, and core formation modeling [\n3\n]. To examine effects of Si on physical properties of Fe-Ni system, we directly measured densities, sound velocities, and melting of Fe-9Ni-10Si (in weight percent) system up to ~280 GPa by shock experiments using a two-stage light-gas gun. The sound velocities were determined by the optical analyzer technique [\n4\n]. The results, compared with the seismic observations, show that silicon-rich liquid Fe-Ni system can satisfy the observed density deficit and seismological data simultaneously at the physical conditions of the outer core. Analyses of the melting temperatures of Fe-9Ni-10Si system imply the Fe-Ni-Si core will be at lower temperatures by ~600−1000 K than the pure iron core at ~330 GPa of the inner-core boundary.\n[1].

The Reduced Data Record of SHARAD data covering the area of the South Polar Layered Deposits (SPLD), has been used. The elaboration and interpretation of the data, aimed to estimate electromagnetic properties of surface layers, has been performed in terms of permittivity. The theory of electromagnetic scattering from fractal surfaces, and the estimation of geometric parameters from topographic data by Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) which was one of five instruments on board the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft, has been used. A deep analysis of inversion has been made on all Mars and extended to the South Polar Caps in order to extract the area with a permittivity constant of CO2 ice. Several corrections have been applied to the data, moreover the calibration of the signal requires the determination of a constant that takes into account the power gain due to the radar system and the surface in order to compensate the power losses due to the orbitographic phenomena. The determination of regions with high probability of buried CO2 ice in the first layer of the Martian surface, is obtained extracting the real part of the permittivity constant of the CO2 ice (~2), estimated by other means. The permittivity of CO2ice is extracted from the Global Permittivity Map of Mars using the global standard deviation of itself as following:\nεCO2ice=εCO2ice+ Σ (1)\nwhere Σ=±std(εMapMars)/2\nFigure 1(a) shows the south polar areas where the values of the permittivity point to the possibility of a CO2 ice layer. Figure 1(b) is the corresponding geologic map. The comparison between the two maps indicates that the area with probable buried CO2 overlaps Hesperian and Amazonian polar units (Hp, Hesperian plains-forming deposits marked by narrow sinuous, anabranching ridges and irregular depressions, and Apu, Amazonian layered plateaus). From this analysis, the south polar cap could be covered by a thin frozen carbon dioxide coating. The perennial south polar cap is probably made of frozen carbon dioxide ca. 8 meters thick.",

            "abstract": "Automatic cameras allow acquisition of large amounts of information at high resolution in both temporal and spatial dimensions, with a roughly close range. Recently, ground cameras have been used to study the morphological evolution of fluvial environments (e.g. bank erosion, bar mobility, braided pattern changes) or to quantify components of fluvial dynamics (e.g. flow velocity, wood transport or river ice development). As the amount of information increases, automation of the data processing becomes essential, but many challenges arise to improve features detection, taking into account light contrasts, shadow and reflection, or to calculate surfaces and volumes from image orthorectification. This study illustrates the high potential of ground cameras to observe and quantify rapid, stochastic or complex events in fluvial systems and the numerous challenges we have to face. In order to automatically monitor such key fluvial processes, two ground cameras were installed. The first one was placed on the Genissiat dam (Rhône River, France) focusing on the reservoir where pieces of wood are trapped, creating a large raft. The objective is to survey wood raft area over time as a surrogate of the basin wood production. The second camera was installed along the St Jean River (Gaspesia, Québec) focusing on a pool section. The objective here is to characterize the evolution of ice cover, in terms of growing rate and ice types. The snowy environment is particularly challenging because of brightness or fairly homogeneous radiometric conditions amongst ice types. In both cases, remote sensing technics, especially feature based classification are used. Radiometric and texture indexes are used to discriminate both wood and water and ice types.",

            "abstract": "Mineralogical alteration of reservoir rocks, driven by fluid circulation in natural or enhanced hydrothermal systems, is likely to influence the long-term performance of geothermal power generation. A key factor is the change of porosity due to dissolution of primary minerals and precipitation of secondary phases. Porosity changes will affect fluid circulation and solute transport, which, in turn, influence mineralogical alteration.\nThis study is part of the Sinergia COTHERM project (COmbined hydrological, geochemical and geophysical modeling of geotTHERMal systems, grant number CRSII2_141843/1) that is an integrative research project aimed at improving our understanding of the sub‐surface processes in magmatically‐driven natural geothermal systems. These are typically high enthalphy systems where a magmatic pluton is located at a few kilometers depth. These shallow plutons increase the geothermal gradient and trigger the circulation of hydrothermal waters with a steam cap forming at shallow depth.\nField observations suggest that active and fossil Icelandic hydrothermal systems are built from a superposition of completely altered and completely unaltered layers. With help of 1D and 2D reactive transport models (OpenGeoSys-GEM code), we investigate the reasons for this finding, by studying the mineralogical evolution of protoliths with different initial porosities at different temperatures and pressures, different leaching water composition and gas content, and different porosity geometries (i.e. porous medium versus fractured medium). From this study, we believe that the initial porosity of protoliths and volume changes due to their transformation into secondary minerals are key factors to explain the different alteration extents observed in field studies. We also discuss how precipitation and dissolution kinetics can influence the alteration time scales.",

            "abstract": "Covering many different sizes of scale, landslides are widespread and pose a severe hazard in many areas as soon as humans or infrastructure are affected. In order to provide geophysical tools and techniques to better characterize sites prone to sliding, a geophysical assessment working towards a geotechnical understanding of landslides is necessary.\nAs part of a joint project studying clay-related landslides in Nordic countries by a suite of geophysical methods, we therefore tested the use of shear wave reflection seismics to survey shallow structures that are known to be related to quick-clay landslide processes in southern Sweden. On two crossing profiles, a land streamer consisting of 120 SH-geophones with 1 m spacing was deployed, and an ELVIS micro-vibrator was shaking every 4 m to generate the shear wave signal. SH-wave data of high quality were thereby acquired to resolve the gaps between P-wave data and electrical and surface wave based methods of lower resolution.\nAfter quality control, correlation, subtractive stack, and geometry setup, single shot gathers already demonstrate the high data quality gained in the region, especially on a gravel road. The migrated depth sections image the structural inventory down to ca. 50 m depth with vertical resolution of less than 1 m. Horizontally layered sediments are visible in the upper 40 m of soft (marine) sediments, followed by top basement with a rough topography varying between ca. 20-40 m depth. The imaged, bowl-shaped basement morphology centres near the profile crossing, and basement is exposed at three sides of the profiles.\nThree distinct sediment sequences are separated by high-amplitude unconformities. The quick-clay layer may be located above the marked reflection set that lies on top of the more transparent sequence that levels out the basement. Located between 15-20 m depth, this correlates with the height of the last scarp that occurred in the area. In addition, shear wave velocities are determined and can be used for geotechnical interpretation.",

            "abstract": "Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the most spectacular eruptive phenomena in the solar atmosphere. It is generally accepted that CMEs are results of eruptions of magnetic flux ropes (MFRs). However, a heated debate is on whether MFRs pre-exist before the eruptions or they are formed during the eruptions. Several coronal signatures, e.g., filaments, coronal cavities, sigmoid structures and hot channels (or hot blobs), are proposed as MFRs and observed before the eruption, which support the pre existing MFR scenario. There is almost no reported observation about MFR formation during the eruption. In this presentation, we present an intriguing observation of a solar eruptive event with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory, which shows a detailed formation process of the MFR during the eruption. The process started with the expansion of a low lying coronal arcade, possibly caused by the flare magnetic reconnection underneath. The newly-formed ascending loops from below further pushed the arcade upward, stretching the surrounding magnetic field. The arcade and stretched magnetic field lines then curved-in just below the arcade vertex, forming an X-point. The field lines near the X-point continued to approach each other and a second magnetic reconnection was induced. It is this high-lying magnetic reconnection that led to the formation and eruption of a hot blob (~ 10 MK), presumably a MFR, producing a CME. We suggest that two spatially-separated magnetic reconnections occurred in this event, responsible for producing the flare and the hot blob (CME), respectively.",

            "abstract": "The Haitian earthquake of 12 January 2010 (Mw=7) caused an unprecedented disaster in Port-au-Prince as well as in smaller cities close to the epicenter. The extent of damage appears to be initially attributed to the proximity of the earthquake in Port-au-Prince, the extreme vulnerability of many structures, and a high population density. However, the damage distribution for this earthquake suggests a general correlation of damage with small-scale topographical features and local geological structure.\nThe main objective of this work is to investigate site effects in the city of Port-au-Prince. It is also to better define the response of different sites to earthquakes and establish transfer functions between each site and a particular site defined as a reference site. Specific soil columns is determined in the vicinity of each station in order to carry out 1D simulations of soil response at these sites.\nAbout 90 earthquakes (2<Mw<5) were recorded between March 2010 and February 2013 on a local network composed of nine accelerometers installed by USGS, three broad-band velocimeters installed by NRCAN and two velocimeters of the French “Sismo at school” network. We located 39 of these events using the permanent network and 43 were located by Douilly et al. (2013) using a temporary network.\nThe ground motion recordings at these stations were then analyzed in order to study the topographic and lithologic amplification effects observed on these sites. To quantify site effects under each station, we have used classical spectral ratio methods. In a first step, the HVSR earthquake method (Horizontal over Vertical ratio) was used to choose a reference station in Port au Prince that should be ideally a station without any site effects. We selected HCEA station as reference station. In a second step, we estimated the transfer function at each station by the SSR (Standard Spectral Ratio). Finally, these transfer functions estimated by the spectral ratios technique were compared to 1D simulations. We evidenced the existence of a possible surface wave effects in the plain of Port-au-Prince and topographical effects in the hills of Canape-vert.",

As rapidly blooming organisms, they are sensitive to oceanic and atmospheric conditions. Although general insight may come from qualitative diatom studies relationships, the development of quantitative methods allows quantitative reconstructions. For paleoceanographic applications it is important to understand what is really controlling different species presence and/or absence, and which statistical approaches provide unbiased quantitative information on past ecological/environmental conditions avoiding intercorrelations between oceanic properties, when developing mathematical/statistical environmental prediction functions. Here, statistically significant transfer functions based on diatom assemblages will be presented for productivity in the North Pacific area. The ability of quantitativally reconstruct how much primary productivity (gC/m2/y) there is at the surface, represents the delimitation of an end member of the Carbon cycle and provides information for Carbon models.These calculations results from modern calibrations comprising more than 200 core top samples and in situ and satellite derived data for the North Pacific. Several statistical methods were applied and Unimodal techniques are compared with Modern Analog Techniques and Artificial Neural Networks. From the resulting significant calibrations, derived equations will be applied in order to reconstruct past oceanic properties, including primary productivity. These past reconstructions will be presented and compared for the Last Glacial Maximum and if possible for other time slices. In addition, since the NE Pacific comprises an upwelling area, a comparison of modern calibrations and downcore results will also be presented. This comparison will allow for a better understanding regarding reconstructions of primary productivity reconstructions in upwelling versus non-upwelling regimes for the NE and NW Pacific.",

            "abstract": "Mass and energy exchanges between soil, plants and atmosphere are key factors controlling a number of environmental processes involving hydrology, biota and climate. The understanding of these exchanges also play a critical role for practical purposes such as precision agriculture. In this contribution we present a methodology based on coupling innovative data collection and models. In particular we propose the use of hydro-geophysical monitoring via 4D Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) in conjunction with measurements of plant transpiration via sap flow and evapotranspiration from Eddy Correlation (EC). This abundance of data are to be fed in spatially distributed soil models in order to comprehend the distribution of active roots. We conducted experiments in an orange orchard in Eastern Sicily (Italy). We installed a 3D electrical tomography apparatus consisting of 4 instrumented micro boreholes placed at the corners of a square (about 1.3 m in side) surrounding an orange tree. During the monitoring, we collected repeated ERT and TDR soil moisture measurements, soil water sampling, sap flow measurements from the orange tree and EC data. Irrigation, precipitation, sap flow and ET data are available for a long period of time allowing knowledge of the long term forcing conditions on the system. This wealth of information was used to calibrate a 1D Richards’ equation model representing the dynamics of the volume monitored via 3D ERT. Information on the soil hydraulic properties was collected from laboratory experiments as well as by time-lapse ERT monitoring of irrigation a few months after the main experiment, when the orange tree had been cut. The results of the calibrated modeling exercise allow the quantification of the soil volume interested by root water uptake. This volume is much smaller (an area less than 2 square meters, 40 cm thick) than generally believed and assumed in the design of classical drip irrigation schemes.",

            "abstract": "Catchment dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes are governed by complex interactions involving hydrodynamic drivers which control biogeochemical processes generating DOC and regulate hydrological connectivity which, in turn, determines solute transport through the landscape to the stream network. Here, we present the application of a simple coupled hydrological-biogeochemical model to simulate daily streamwater DOC data to improve understanding of the dynamics of DOC fluxes from different landscape units to the aquatic environment. The model design allows the relative importance of DOC fluxes from the major landscape units (hillslopes, groundwater and saturation area) to be determined. The dynamic saturation zone contributed 84% (including 16% from the hillslope) of DOC to the stream, showing its disproportional influence over stream water chemistry which at maximum wetness comprises 40% of the area. The temporal connectivity of each of the landscape units was dependent on the antecedent conditions with a highly transient connection between the hillslope and valley bottom saturated area which was entirely disconnected during the driest periods. The groundwater contributions remained constant, but its relative importance increased during the driest periods. This work shows that predictive modelling is contingent upon conceptualising the non-linearity in hydrological connectivity, its relation to hydroclimatic factors and consequent role in the transport of DOC.",

            "abstract": "The solar wind is a natural laboratory for the study of turbulent plasma. In-situ observations from different spacecraft such as STEREO, Wind, ACE or Cluster allow us to investigate turbulence from magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) to kinetic scales (sub-ion and electron scales) of solar wind turbulence. With single spacecraft observations the Taylor frozen-in-flow assumption (Vf<<Vsw, Vf is the phase speed of the fluctuations) is usually used to infer spatial (i.e., wavenumber) spectra from the temporal (i.e., frequency) ones measured onboard the spacecraft. While this assumption is generally valid at MHD scales, its validity at electron scales is questionable because of the possible presence of fluctuations having high phase speeds (e.g., whistler or parallel Alfvén waves). In this study we use a simple method to test the validity of Taylor hypothesis in solar wind turbulence at electron scales using the FGM and the STAFF data of the Cluster mission. We show that a significant fraction of the observed spectra violates the Taylor hypothesis. Furthermore, we introduce a toy model to investigate the effects of violating of the Taylor hypothesis on the slopes of the turbulent spectra. From different possible propagation angles and solar wind speeds we show that the slopes vary only slightly in the inertial range, while they vary significantly in the dispersive range. These simulations results can explain the narrow (resp. broader) distribution of the slopes in the inertial (resp. dispersive) range observed in the solar wind.",

            "abstract": "High altitude environments are often exposed to strong winds, thus drifting snow can create a small-scale pattern of highly variable snow heights. This has profound implications for the ground thermal regime. Variability in mean annual ground surface temperatures of up to 6°C within areas of 1 km2 have been documented from Svalbard and Norway earlier, and can to a large degree be explained by variation of maximum snow heights. Land surface models or permafrost models employing an average snow height per grid cell of e.g. 1 km2or larger are not capable of representing such local-scale variability.\nThis study presents a robust scheme where we statistically represent the sub-grid variability of ground surface temperatures and demonstrate that we can reproduce the distribution within a grid cell. This is achieved by (1) applying a simple terrain parameter (Winstral et al., 2002) on a 10 meter DEM, estimating exposure from a selected wind direction. The degree of exposure is estimated for main wind directions over the winter season, derived from HINDCAST 10 m wind direction data (ERA40 reanalysis downscaled using HIRLAM, Norwegian Meteorological Institute), available at approximately 11 km (0.1 degree) spatial resolution and 2 hour temporal resolution back to 1957. Here we obtain a statistical representation of the distribution of maximum snow heights. (2) we use this information for calculating ground temperature distributions within the grid cells using a simple equilibrium permafrost model (CryoGRID 1). Finally, we test this approach at four 100 km2sized areas where we have extensive field observations, located along a latitudinal transect in Norway. We demonstrate that the inclusion of a snow distribution function within each grid-cell clearly improves the representation of permafrost coverage in high latitude areas.\nWinstral, A., K.

            "abstract": "Arctic sea ice has seen a tremendous decline in recent decades, concurrently leading to higher temperatures across the high latitudes. Although increasingly strong evidence exists for this link between sea ice and temperature, the extra step of linking sea ice retreat – through these climatic changes – to a change in greenhouse-gas exchange is much less obvious. Recently, however, it has been suggested that methane emissions have increased as sea ice declined (Parmentier et al., 2013), leading to concerns that sea ice decline has led to a perturbation of the terrestrial component of the Arctic greenhouse gas balance.\nThis initial analysis, however, compared average methane emissions of the Arctic Region with anomalies in the average sea ice extent for the entire summer, which evens out regional and temporal differences. The pattern of year-to-year fluctuations in sea ice extent varies from region to region and the impact on methane emissions – through temperature – is therefore expected to vary spatially, too. Our goal is thus to elucidate to what degree a correlation between methane emissions and sea ice exists in areas of high retreat compared to areas that have seen less sea ice decline. In addition, the impact of sea ice retreat on methane emissions is investigated throughout the melt season to identify those periods in which the teleconnection between sea ice and methane emissions is most pronounced.\nTo this purpose, the output from three regional methane models (LPJ-GUESS WhyMe, Peatland-VU and TEM6) has been compared to independent observations of sea ice extent, and subjected to a rigorous spatial and temporal analysis. A similar response to sea ice retreat among these models will increase our confidence that teleconnections between methane emissions and sea ice decline exist within the Arctic.\n\n",

            "abstract": "The present analysis focuses on the model capability to properly simulate long-range Saharan dust transport for summer 2012 in the Western Mediterranean. In this period, Saharan dust events were numerous as shown by satellite and ground-based remote sensing observations.\nAn exhaustive comparison of model outputs against other models and observations can reveal weaknesses of individual models, provide an assessment of uncertainties in simulating the dust cycle and give additional information on sources for potential model improvement. For this kind of study, multiple and different observations are combined to deliver a detailed idea of the structure and evolution of the dust cloud and the state of the atmosphere at the different stages of the event. The present contribution shows an intercomparison of a set of 7 European regional dust model simulations (NMMB/BSC-Dust, ALADIN, Meso-NH, RegCM, CHIMERE, COSMO/MUSCAT; MOCAGE and BSC-DREAM8b). In this study, the model outputs are compared against a variety of both ground-based and airborne in situ and remote sensing measurements performed during the pre-ChArMEx/TRAQA ﬁeld campaign which included in particular several AERONET sites, the airborne lidar LNG, sounding with a ULA and with the new balloonborne optical particle counter LOAC showing large particles (>15 µm), the CARAGA network of weekly deposition samples, etc. The models are also compared with satellite aerosol products (including MSG/SEVIRI, MODIS, POLDER and CALIOP), which provide a description of the spatial AOD distribution over the basin. These observational datasets provide a complete set of unusual quantitative constraints for model simulations of this period, combining data on aerosol optical depth, vertical distribution, particle size distribution, deposition flux, and chemical and optical properties.\n Acknowledgements are addressed to OMP/SEDOO for the ChArMEx data portal and to CNES for balloon operations and funding.

            "abstract": "Many magmatic provinces produce strongly bimodal volcanism with abundant mafic and silicic magmas yet a scarcity of intermediate compositions (55-65 wt % SiO2). In such bimodal settings, much debate revolves around whether the basaltic magmas act as heat sources to melt pre-existing crust, or whether they are the parents to the silicic magmas (fractionation dominated evolution). Commonly, this scarcity of intermediate compositions has been used to support models involving large degrees of crustal melting.\nWe present evidence of intermediate liquids associated with rhyolite petrogenesis in a famously bimodal province, the Yellowstone-Snake River Plain (YSRP) volcanic area in the western USA. The intermediate (57-67 wt % SiO2) liquids with compositions representing liquid lines of descent are preserved as melt inclusions in pyroxene crystals from two rhyolitic ignimbrites erupted from the 6.6-4.5 Ma Heise volcanic field in eastern Idaho. The host pyroxenes also yield major and trace element compositions in equilibrium with intermediate melts prior to significant plagioclase fractionation.\nThe occurrence of such intermediate melts, most likely typically erased in the high temperature rhyolitic ignimbrites of the YSRP by diffusive re-equilibration, supports the importance of assimilation-fractional crystallisation (AFC) as a primary petrogenetic process. The crystal fractionation driving magma compositions towards the erupted rhyolites requires that unerupted cumulate reservoirs are left behind in the mid-crust – a conclusion supported by earlier seismic studies.",

            "abstract": "It is widely accepted that the Southern Ocean is an important component of the climate system, acting as a key site for carbon and heat exchange between the atmosphere and oceans. The deglaciation with its associated millenial climate changes is a key time period for testing the mechanisms behind these exchanges. Ascertaining the precise timing of these events is a challenge given complications from variable and largely unconstrained reservoir ages, dissolution of carbonate hard parts and sediment redistribution by strong currents. Nevertheless improvements to our understanding of Southern Ocean dynamics in the past requires accurately-dated proxy records that can be embedded in GCM models. Radiocarbon measured in deep-sea corals offers just such an archive and proxy. Using the skeletons of deep-sea corals we are now able to reconstruct aspects of the history of three distinct water masses in the Drake Passage on a precise timescale, allowing direct comparison to U-series dated speleothem terrestrial records and polar ice cores. We present here a new deglacial radiocarbon record from the Drake Passage which more than doubles the resolution of published records. We focus on the deglacial, as well as providing insights from the contrasting period leading up to the LGM. Together with new data from far-field sites we interpret our results as evidence for a Southern Ocean control on atmospheric carbon dioxide and radiocarbon evolution during the deglaciation, and a northern hemisphere control during the run up to the LGM.",

            "abstract": "Current global scale estimates of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks do not account for pedogenic processes unique to permafrost environments. The Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database (NCSCD) was compiled to address this lack of knowledge of permafrost affected soils. The NCSCD links pedon data in the 0–3 m depth range from the northern permafrost regions to several digitized regional soil classification maps to produce a combined circumpolar coverage. While these different soil classification maps have been harmonized to a common soil classification system, the maps are of different origin and age and they were produced at a range of different scales (fig. 1). The spatial distribution of soil pedon data is also highly uneven with notable data-gaps in central Siberia, the High Arctic and Alpine regions.\nThe NCSCD is thus a dataset with its roots in traditional soil survey and soil map data and with substantial uncertainties and data-gaps. The original maps are subdivided into polygons where soil specialists have mapped different coverages of soil orders. The NCSCD has been gridded and is currently in use for many different model-based studies. This conversion of polygon-based data to the gridded world of spatial or process-based models can affect accuracy, precision and usability of a dataset. There are also inherent difficulties in assessing the uncertainty of stock or process quantifications based on polygon soil maps such as the NCSCD.\nSoil science is moving into a fully digital world where new maps of soil order distribution or soil properties are based on gridded remote sensing products. Such data can more easily be scaled and adapted for use in grid-based soil models. However, it is argued that the traditional soil maps are still extremely valuable data-sets that contain information that may be lost in fully digital soil mapping approaches. This presentation discusses these issues and gives some examples of how existing pedon databases and soil maps can be made useful for broad scale model applications.",

            "abstract": "Ocean waves, driven by atmospheric processes, generate faint continuous Earth vibrations known as microseisms (Bromirski, 1999). Under certain conditions, ocean waves travelling in opposite directions may interact with one another producing a partial or full standing wave. This wave-wave interaction produces a pressure profile, unattenuated with depth, which exerts a pressure change at the seafloor, resulting in secondary microseisms in the 0.1-0.33 Hz band.\nThere are clear correlations between microseism amplitude and storm and ocean wave intensity. We aim to determine ocean wave heights in the Northeast Atlantic offshore Ireland at individual buoy locations, using terrestrially recorded microseism signals. Two evolutionary approaches are used: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Grammatical Evolution (GE). These systems learn to interpret particular input patterns and corresponding outputs and expose the often complex underlying relationship between them. They learn by example and are therefore entirely data driven so data selection is extremely important for the success of the methods. An analysis and comparison of the performance of these methods for a five month period in 2013 will be presented showing that ocean wave characteristics may be reconstructed using microseism amplitudes, adopting a purely data driven approach.\nThere are periods during the year when the estimations made from both the GE and ANN are delayed in time by 10 to 20 hours when compared to the target buoy measurements. These delays hold important information about the totality of the conditions needed for microseism generation, an analysis of which will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Open freshwaters appear to be the second largest natural source of methane (CH4) globally, but the present data is dominated by short measurements (30 min to 24 h). Moreover, such measurements were rarely repeated regularly which makes overall data and interpretations of flux regulation uncertain. For example, recent results indicate that periods with high temperatures or passing low pressure events can greatly influence fluxes and thereby it is unclear how representative previous data are. Consequently, we lack the information needed to build predictive models of CH4 emissions in different types of lakes and under different conditions. This presentation summarizes results from repeated spatially distributed CH4 flux measurements over full growth seasons to years, in multiple lakes in Sweden at different latitudes, and having varying characteristics in terms of nutrient and organic carbon concentrations, and basin morphometry. Questions regarding differences among lakes, factors regulating emissions, and possibilities to predict methane emissions from lakes will be in focus.",

            "abstract": "Aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are tightly linked through energy, material, information, and organism flows. At the landscape scale, these reciprocal flows are controlled by the composition, configuration, boundary conditions and linkage of individual ecosystem types, thereby forming so-called meta-ecosystems. The relative importance of individual ecosystem types depends on the intrinsic properties (so-called “ecosystem traits”), the setting within the landscape, and the characteristics of interfaces that control cross-system fluxes. For example, the juxtaposition of particular ecosystem types (i.e. their composition and configuration) may alter the magnitude of landscape processes as well as the directions of flow among ecosystem types. Therefore, the meta-ecosystem concept provides a framework to quantify ecosystem diversity, a neglected component of biodiversity, and to test its effects on genetic and species diversity as well as the functional performance in coupled ecosystems. Given their topographic position at the lowest point in the landscape, aquatic ecosystems are particularly susceptible to influences exerted by their surrounding terrestrial environment, both the immediately adjacent riparian zones and the entire catchment that they drain. Questions that need to be tackled may include: What are the consequences of exchange pulses between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems on the functional performance of individual ecosystems? What are the mechanisms and processes underlying structural and functional biodiversity at aquatic-terrestrial interfaces? In this respect, the meta-ecosystem concept might be very helpful in landscape management and in ecosystem design and engineering.",

            "abstract": "Shock fronts are known to be efficient particle accelerators. At Earth, ions with energies exceeding 100 keV are frequently seen upstream of the bow shock. This energization is generally attributed to diffusive shock acceleration, however, for this process to become effective it is first required that the ions undergo an initial acceleration. How and where this acceleration takes place has not yet been determined, and it is one of the key unsolved issues in shock acceleration theory. There are a few proposed models, based for example on resonant wave-particle interaction or particle scattering from the quasi-perpendicular shock section, but there is yet no consensus and there is a lack of observational validation for the models. We here investigate the nature of these acceleration processes for a series of Cluster spacecraft crossings of the quasi-parallel bow shock. Focus is put on detailed observations of coherent beams within the turbulent transition region and their coupling to magnetic field pulsations and structures. By comparing the observations against predictions from theoretical models as well as with 3-D hybrid simulations, we can evaluate the potential source processes involved in the acceleration, and begin to understand the origin of the variety of magnetic and particle signatures seen in the data.",

            "abstract": "The ChemCam instrument on Mars Science Laboratory determines the elemental composition of target areas at ≤6m range, and has acquired over 145000 spectra. Here we use the individual shots and averaged targets with the PLS1 dataset on both outcrops and float rocks.\nVarious localities were sampled, including Rocknest, Sheepbed, Shaler, Cooperstown, Darwin and Kimberley. Rocknest and Sheepbed shots have quite homogeneous, basaltic compositions with Gini factors of 0.66 and 0.67 respectively (a Gini factor of 0 indicates a completely homogeneous dataset). Shaler is similarly homogeneous with a Gini factor 0.62 but is more felsic in composition. Darwin and Kimberley both follow a basaltic mixing trend between pyroxene and alkali feldspars. They have a heterogeneous spread with factors of 0.77 and 0.74. Kimberley and Darwin are the most alkaline outcrops, and then Shaler, finally Sheepbed and Rocknest are the least alkaline. The Na2O and K2O contents are controlled by variable abundances of alkaline feldspars.\nMany float rocks were also analysed. They include samples with mm-sized, visible feldspar grains, which are probable phenocrysts and cumulate grains. These rocks likely come from different sources as their compositions are quite heterogeneous e.g. the Gini factor for the whole set of feldspar-rich float rocks is 0.76 (using an average composition for each target). We compare these compositions with data from the MER APXS, and from this we can see that the float rocks sampled by MSL are closer to the alkaline feldspar end of the basaltic mixing trend than the more FeO+MgO-rich MER basalts (e.g. Rieder et al. 2004 10.1126/science.1104358) The basaltic shergottite meteorites also have higher FeO+MgO contents and lower Al2O3 than the MSL rocks. When compared on Al2O3-(FeOMgO)-(Na2OK2O)-CaO and other plots, the float rocks have compositions similar to a spread between terrestrial diorite and gabbro, though some have high Na2O+K2O contents.",

            "abstract": "A variety of different climate factors can trigger floods: intense rainfall, long lasting rainfall or extreme amount of snowmelt. As a result, changes in climate extremes can affect both the frequency of floods, but also other factors such as seasonality and duration, all of which have implications on local social and ecological systems. Therefore, we present a technique for examining projected changes in flood events types, focusing on antecedent meteorological conditions. Floods (characterized by the historical 10 and 25-year return level discharge) are clustered into causal types based on rainfall, antecedent precipitation and temperature. A multi-site weather generator coupled with a conceptual rainfall-runoff model is employed to increase the number of flood events. Quantile mapping of precipitation and temperature projections is then used in the development of future discharge. The technique is applied to two different catchments in the European Alps: a smaller catchment in the southern French Alps, dominated by rain-on-snow floods, and a larger catchment in Austria, with more floods during summer. The results show that changes in precipitation and temperature can alter not only the frequency, but also the distribution of flood event types in the future. Furthermore, assessing changes in flood event types provides information about why the frequency of floods in an alpine catchment may change, even if the projections themselves are highly uncertain.",

            "abstract": "The long term fate of mobile CO2 remaining after the injection period is a crucial issue for regulators and operators. There are needs to evaluate properly the amount of gas free to migrate and to estimate the fluid movements at long time scales. Often the difficulty is to manage the computational time to assess the large time and dimension scale of the problem. The second limitation is the large level of uncertainty associated to the computation prediction. A variance-based global sensitivity analysis is proposed to assess the importance ranking of uncertainty sources, with regards to the behavior of the mobile CO2 during the post-injection period. We consider three output parameters which characterize the location and the quantity of mobile CO2, considering residual and dissolution trapping. To circumvent both (i) the large number of computationally intensive reservoir-scale flow simulations and (ii) the different nature of uncertainties whether linked to parameters (continuous variables) or to modeling assumptions (scenario-like variables) we propose to use advanced meta-modeling techniques of ACOSSO-type. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated using a potential site for CO2 storage in the Paris basin (France), for which the amount, nature and quality of the data available at disposal and the associated uncertainties can be seen as representative to those of a storage project at the post-screening stage. A special attention has been paid to confront the results of the sensitivity analysis with the physical interpretation of the processes.",

Additionally, methodological (e.g. open system behaviour within 230Th/238U-series dating), local tectonic (i.e. site specific subsidence/uplift), and isostatic influences complicate their interpretation as markers of past sea level. Nonetheless, they remain a preeminent method for reconstructing and evaluating former sea levels during the Late Quaternary.\nOur compilation is unique as we use modern ecological depth habitat constraints to refine our reconstructions. To support the growing awareness within the palaeoclimate community of the importance of coral habitat, we provide both global and regional depth habitat ranges for each species in our reconstruction of past sea levels.\nAs such we present an internally consistent global compilation of coral benchmarks (building on the compilations of Medina-Elizalde, 2012 and Dutton and Lambeck, 2012) containing >100 studies. We include a rigorous consideration of each error term associated with these records, such as: age, depth habitat, elevation measurement, and uplift correction. We apply commonly employed age screening methods (δ234Uinitial and detrital 230Th concentrations) before undertaking a site specific assessment of each sea-level record. This includes consideration of stratigraphic integrity, replication (and any concordant age determinations) and validation of assumptions (e.g. uplift rates), where possible. Finally, we present a statistical assessment of the distribution of the data (where sufficient data density allows) within each site-specific sea-level record.\nThis presentation will show the dataset as currently compiled (>2,600 datapoints), and initial evaluations on a site-specific basis.",

            "abstract": "Wind speed and atmospheric stability have an important role in determining the turbulence in the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) as well as the surface wave field. The understanding of MABL dynamics in northwest Europe is complicated by fetch effects, the proximity of coastlines, shallow topography, and larger scale circulation patterns (e.g., cold air outbreaks). Numerical models have difficulty simulating the marine atmospheric boundary layer in coastal areas and partially enclosed seas, and this is partly due to spatial resolution problems at coastlines. In these offshore environments, the boundary layer processes are often best understood directly from time series measurements from fixed platforms or buoys, in spite of potential difficulties from platform flow distortion as well as the spatial sparseness of the data sets. This contribution presents the results of time series measurements from offshore platforms in the North Sea and Norwegian Sea in terms of a summary diagnostic – wind speed versus air-sea temperature difference (U-ΔT) – with important implications for understanding atmospheric boundary layer processes. The U-ΔT diagram was introduced in earlier surveys of data from coastal (Sletringen; O.J. Andersen and J. Løvseth, J. Wind Eng. Ind. Aerodyn., 57, 97–109, 1995) and offshore (Statfjord A; K.J. Eidsvik, Boundary-Layer Meteorol., 32, 103–132, 1985) sites in northwest Europe to summarize boundary layer conditions at a given location. Additional information from a series of measurement purpose-built offshore measurement and oil/gas production platforms from the southern North Sea to the Norwegian Sea illustrates how the wind characteristics vary spatially over large distances, highlighting the influence of cold air outbreaks, in particular. The results are important for the offshore wind industry because of the way that wind turbines accrue fatigue damage in different conditions of atmospheric stability and wind speed.",

It thus provides an unusual opportunity to compare the modelled timescales from each phase, and assess the limitations of single-phase diffusion modelling in lower-temperature, rhyolitic volcanic systems. The presence of a late-stage compositionally distinct melt (the ‘bright-rim’ melt) mixing into the lower parts of the Bishop magma chamber has been noted by many authors [e.g. Wark et al. 2007, Geology 35, 235; Roberge et al. 2013, CMP 165, 237; Chamberlain et al. 2014, J Petrol 55, 395] in later-erupted material discharged from vents along the northern ring fracture of the caldera.\nHere we present the results of 1D diffusion modelling of Ba and Sr in sanidine, Ti in quartz and Fe-Mg interdiffusion in orthopyroxene in samples from later-erupted ignimbrite packages in the tuff. Timescales from diffusion modelling of Fe-Mg interdiffusion in orthopyroxene are <20 years; Ti in quartz <150 years and from Ba and Sr in sanidine <10000 years. The orders of magnitude variance between different crystal phases can be attributed to either distinct differences in the timing of interaction with the ‘bright-rim’ melt, or to uncertainties in the diffusion coefficient (orthopyroxene) and incorrect assumptions about the initial conditions for diffusion modelling (sanidine), or some combination of these factors. By combined modelling of Ba and Sr diffusion in sanidine the diffusion timescales are reduced to <1000 years, implying that interaction of the ‘bright-rim' melt may have occurred over more extended timescales, and was not necessarily a direct eruptive trigger for the Bishop Tuff eruption. We highlight the importance of having a good understanding of the assumptions made and uncertainties in diffusion coefficients when undertaking such modelling, especially in examples where only one phase is available for diffusion modelling.",

Six cores were recovered from Hole C0002P between 2163 and 2218 mbsf. Four whole-round (WR) specimens from depths of 2174.98 to 2209.64 mbsf were tested for constant-flow permeability with a focus on thin interbeds of silty claystone and fine-grained turbidites. Samples are from lithostratigraphic Unit V (accreted trench or Shikoku Basin hemipelagic deposits). Coarser interbeds are important for assessing the prospects of flow through stratigraphic conduits. Our primary objective is to better understand how hydrogeologic properties of different lithologies respond to deformation within the accretionary prism.\nEquipment for permeability tests consists of a withdrawal-infuse syringe pump to simultaneously inject and extract pore fluid from the top and bottom of the specimen to generate hydraulic head difference. Specimens were trimmed for tests in both vertical direction (along-core) and horizontal direction (cross-core) with the diameter of 3.8 cm (1.5 in). The isotropic effective stress is set at 0.55 MPa. The WR specimens are heterogeneous. The major lithology is silty claystone to fine-grained silty claystone. Some intervals contain thin (~1.3 cm) oblique sandy layers and black organic bands. Bedding is steep to vertical (~70-80˚). One goal is to determine how this lithologic variability affects the anisotropy of permeability.\nEnvironmental SEM was used to image the cores (in multiple directions) to evaluate the relation between sediment microstructure and anisotropy of permeability.",

We investigated several laboratory generated SOA particles systems for their initial water uptake and ice formation propensity as a function of temperature, T, relative humidity with respect to water, RH, relative humidity with respect to ice, RHice, and for different humidification rates, cRHice. This includes pure SOA particles formed from α-pinene, isoprene, and longifolene volatile organic compound precursors with and without the presence of sulfate seed particles as well as oxidized soot and soot-coated α-pinene and naphthalene SOA with varying O/C ratios and coating thicknesses. Micro-spectroscopic chemical imaging using scanning transmission X‐ray microscopy with near edge X‐ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (STXM/NEXAFS) is used to characterize SOA, SOA-sulfate, SOA-soot particles generated in the Boston College potential aerosol mass (PAM) flow reactor in relation to their ice nucleation behavior. Water uptake is consistently observed on SOA particles at RH=75% and 95% for 262 and 228 K, respectively, followed by homogeneous ice nucleation applying atmospherically relevant cRHice=1 % min-1. When cRHice=25 % min-1, ice nucleation is delayed by about 30-40% RHice and cannot be explained by homogeneous ice nucleation. This implies diffusion limitation of water into these potentially glassy or semi-solid organic particles resulting in non-equilibrium between ambient RH and particle water activity. These data will aid in our understanding of the role of organic particle phase states in response to changes in T and RH which is crucial information for prediction of atmospheric ice nucleation.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric boundary layers with stable stratification include a variety of small-scale non-turbulent motions such as waves, microfronts and other complex structures. When the thermal stratification becomes strong, the presence of such submeso motions could affect the turbulent mixing to a large extent and common similarity theory that is used to describe weakly stable conditions may become unreliable. The scientific community clearly lacks understanding of what these motions are and of the extent to which they affect turbulent mixing in the stable boundary layer.\nWe use a data-based approach to isolate regimes in which small-scale, non-turbulent motions are a main influencing parameter of turbulent mixing. We apply a clustering methodology derived for multidimensional nonstationary timeseries. The technique is based on a bounded variation, finite element method (FEM-BV) and we use it to characterize the interaction between small-scale non-turbulent motions and turbulence. Turbulence data are approximated by an optimal sequence of locally stationary multivariate autoregressive factor models (VARX) processes and some slow hidden process switching between them (FEM-BV-VARX (Horenko 2010, JAS)). The VARX processes that approximate the data include influence from external forcing. We perform prefiltering of the turbulence data to isolate submeso motions and use them as external forcing in the clustering strategy. Thus the strategy separates periods for which the influence of the external factors, i.e. non-turbulent motions on the turbulence differs.\nWe use this strategy to derive a stochastic representation of the interactions between non-turbulent motions and turbulence under stable stratification. Our results show that submeso motions are a main forcing of turbulence in the most stable cases and not for the weakly stable cases. As these different influence regimes are isolated by the FEM-BV-VARX technique, a Markov transition matrix describes the probability of switching between the different clusters. This transition matrix represents a slow, hidden process governing the response of turbulence data to the chosen influencing factors. Derivation of a stochastic process that represents the reaction of turbulence to forcing by submeso motions and its evolution in time is based on this matrix.",

This approach attempts to retrieve the N2O profiles from the Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) data. First, the sensitivity of atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles and surface parameters between two spectral absorption bands were simulated by using the radiative transfer model. Second, the eigenvector regression algorithm is used to construct a priori state. Third, an optimal estimate method was developed based on the band selection of N2O. Finally, we compared our retrieved AIRS profiles with HIPPO data, and analyzed the seasonal and annual N2O distribution in China from 2004 to 2013.",

In this paper, we investigate the characteristics of electromagnetic waves in ULF (ultra low frequency) band associated with different phases of geomagnetic storms. Electromagnetic waves in ULF band (Period~ 10-100s) in the Earth's magnetosphere are generally termed as geomagnetic pulsations. A detailed statistical analysis has been performed over ten years of geomagnetic data from low latitude ground stations in Indian and Japanese sectors. The study reveals that storms in general, are accompanied with continuous pulsations of different frequency bands during different phases. In particular, the main phase of 91 % of intense storms was accompanied with pulsations in Pc5 band (frequency~ 2-7 mHz). However, the occurrence of these pulsations was less frequent during main phase of weak to moderate storms. Further, the amplitude of these pulsations increased with the intensity of storm.",

Moreover, the transport of water bound in hydrous minerals at great depths have a major impact on the Earth’s volatile budget, on the chemical evolution of the Earth, and on the deep mantle composition and rheology.\nHere, we use a numerical tool that combines thermo-mechanical models with a thermodynamic database to examine slab dehydration for present-day and early Earth settings and its consequences for the deep water recycling. We parameterize the amount of water that can be carried deep into the mantle, W (x105 kg/m2), as a function of subduction velocity vs (cm/yr), slab age a (Myrs), and mantle potential temperature Tm (°C):\nW = 1.06vs + 0.14a - 0.023 Tm + 17\nWe generally observe that a 1) 100°C increase in the mantle temperature, or 2) ~15 Myr decrease of plate age, or 3) decrease in subduction velocity of ~2 cm/yr all have the same effect on the amount of water retained in the slab at depth, corresponding to a decrease of ~2.2x105 kg/m2 of H2O. We estimate that for present-day conditions ~26% of the global influx water, or 7x108 Tg/Myr of H2O, is recycled into the mantle. Using a realistic distribution of subduction parameters, we illustrate that deep water recycling might still be possible in early Earth conditions, although its efficiency would generally decrease. Indeed, 0.5-3.7x108 Tg/Myr of H2O could still be recycled in the mantle at 2.8 Ga.",

For this reason they are subject to complex flooding dynamics that arise from the interaction of coastal and continental dynamics. This complexity complicates the analysis of the changes induced by climate change on the distribution of extreme events. In this work, we develop a methodology to characterize the extreme distribution of flooding induced by tropical cyclones in coastal environments under different climates, considering marine dynamics (storm surge and wave run-up) and continental dynamics (precipitation and runoff).\nThe approach followed in this work begins by selecting the tropical cyclones that affected the study area in the past; augmenting it with synthetically-generated cyclones. The maximum dissimilarity algorithm is then used on the dataset to select for dynamical downscaling the K tropical cyclones that best represent the variability on the data.\nNumerical simulations are carried out for these K tropical cyclones to derive the spatial fields of wind (by means of the Hydromet-Rankine Vortex model) and rainfall (using R-Clipper model) induced by the cyclone. SWAN model is used to derive the wave fields, H2D to derive the storm surge fields and a CUENCAS-like model (IH-Mole) to derive runoff fields. All the flood-inducing dynamics are the input to the RFSM-EDA model that computes flood depths for the study area.\nHaving completed the dynamical downscaling database, a Monte Carlo simulation is used to generate synthetic time series of tropical cyclone occurrence. Tropical cyclone climate is related to the spatial patterns of sea surface temperature (SST) fields, which are used in turn as the main driver of a Monte Carlo simulation. Flood time series are derived from cyclone time series using the dynamical downscaling database and interpolation, for those cyclones that have not been simulated.\nOur hybrid approach (mixing statistical and dynamical downscaling) allows us to compute any statistic of the complete flooding distribution at every location of the study site. Moreover, making use of SST data from simulations of future climate, obtained from general circulation models, we can study the effects of climate change in these distributions of extremes.",

            "abstract": "The use of microtremors to obtain shear wave velocity (Vs) profiles of the subsurface is becoming a widespread approach due to its various advantages. Noise measurements were carried out at four sites on Malta (Central Mediterranean). Array techniques were first tested in an area where a ≈45 m layer of soft Blue Clay (BC) overlies the harder limestone. Three array configurations (two arrays of 17 geophones in an L-shape and circle respectively and one 42 geophone array in an L-shape) were tested and processed using the f-k and two SPAC techniques: Modified and Extended SPAC. No significant difference was observed in the dispersion curve from the two short arrays despite having different shapes. However, a significant variation was observed between the dispersion curve from the long and short arrays in the low frequency part. A joint inversion, using two direct search methods, of the dispersion and the H/V curve was then used to obtain the Vs profile for the site, with most of the profiles being in agreement both in terms of velocity and depth.\nA study was also conducted at three other sites on Malta where hard Upper Coralline Limestone (UCL) overlies the soft BC creating a velocity inversion in the soil profile. The shape of the effective dispersion curves obtained using ESAC show both an inverse dispersive trend and normal dispersion. This shape is tentatively explained in terms of the presence of higher mode Rayleigh waves. A Genetic Algorithm approach was then used to jointly invert the H/V and Rayleigh wave dispersion curve. It was observed that the BC velocity was higher when overlain by a large thickness of UCL. This could be linked to the effective pressure caused by the hard UCL, making the BC more compact, and having a higher velocity. The theoretical implications of a prominent low-velocity layer on site amplification and the interpretation of ambient noise data are investigated and discussed.",

The conditions in soil aggregates are of particular interest due to limitations to oxygen diffusion into the core often containing organic carbon (as aggregation agent). The constantly varying soil hydration conditions affect the spatial extent of anoxic conditions in aggregates and thus the sized and self-organization of aerobic and anaerobic microbial communities. We developed an artificial soil aggregate composed of 3-D angular pore network combined with individual based models of motile microbial cells that grow, move, intercept nutrients and are inhibited by presence or absence of oxygen. The hydration conditions in the model aggregate affect community size, spatial segregation, and growth rates. The opposing diffusion directions of oxygen and carbon were essential to maintenance of aerobic and anaerobic communities within an aggregate (anaerobes become extinct when carbon sources are external). Cohabited soil aggregates promoted onset of anaerobic conditions by oxygen consumption by peripheral aerobes. Model predictions of CO2 and N2O production rates were in good agreement with experimental data. Results illustrate how aerobic and anaerobic microbial communities are activated by certain hydration conditions that enhance either nitrogen losses or decomposition of organic matter both contributing to GHG emissions.",

            "abstract": "Biomass burning represents a major source of Black Carbon (BC) aerosol to the atmosphere, which can result in major perturbations to weather, climate and ecosystem development. Large uncertainties in these impacts prevail, particularly on regional scales. One such region is the Amazon Basin, where large, intense and frequent burning occurs on an annual basis during the dry season. Absorption by atmospheric aerosols is underestimated by models over South America, which points to significant uncertainties relating to BC aerosol properties. Results from the South American Biomass Burning Analysis (SAMBBA) field experiment, which took place during September and October 2012 over Brazil on-board the UK Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurement (FAAM) BAe-146 research aircraft, are presented here. Aerosol chemical composition was measured by a DMT Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) and an Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS). The physical, chemical and optical properties of BC-containing particles across the region will be characterised, with particular emphasis on the vertical distribution.\nBC was ubiquitous across the region, with measurements extending from heavily deforested regions in the Western Amazon Basin, through to agricultural fires in the Cerrado (Savannah-like) region and more pristine areas over the Amazon Rainforest. Measurements in the vicinity of Manaus (a city located deep into the jungle) were also conducted. BC concentrations peaked within the boundary layer at a height of around 1.5km. BC-containing particles were found to be rapidly coated in the near-field, with little evidence for additional coating upon advection and dilution. Biomass burning layers within the free troposphere were routinely observed. BC-containing particles within such layers were typically associated with less coating than those within the boundary layer, suggestive of wet removal of more coated BC particles. The importance of such properties in relation to the optical properties of BC and its resultant impact will be investigated. The prevalence of elevated biomass burning layers above the frequent build-up of shallow cumulus clouds during the afternoon will also be characterised. This will provide improved constraint upon the highly uncertain impact of biomass burning aerosol over the region.",

            "abstract": "The fundamental physics of the generation, maintenance and propagation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation are intensely debated. Many theories focus on instabilities arising from interactions between components of the vertical diabatic heating from convection and the large-scale circulation. Most general circulation models (GCMs) exhibit biases in diabatic-heating profiles against observed or reanalysis products, but those products also exhibit considerable discrepancies with one another.\nThe Vertical structure and physical processes of the MJO project is a novel model-evaluation project, designed to assess relationships between diabatic processes in GCMs and their representations of the MJO. A key advantage of the project is the acquisition of temperature, moisture and momentum tendencies from each of the model sub-grid physics schemes. The project has three components, designed to take advantage of known links between biases in short-range forecasts and climate simulations: (1) 20-year AMIP-type simulations to assess the representation of the MJO in each GCM; (2) 2-day hindcasts of two YoTC MJO events to investigate the timestep-level behaviour of physical parameterisations; (3) 20-day hindcasts of the same events to identify links between degradations in forecast skill and the representation of diabatic processes.\nAnalysis of the three component has identified several over-arching conclusions. First, many process-oriented MJO diagnostics derived from past studies using one or several GCMs fail to distinguish between the GCMs in this project that simulate the MJO well and those that do so poorly, whether for initialised hindcasts or 20-year simulations. Second, there is little correlation between GCM hindcast skill for these cases and the fidelity of the MJO representation in climate simulations. Third, all three components have demonstrated that a reliable representation of the moistening profile, particularly lower- and mid-tropospheric moistening during the transition between MJO suppressed and active phases, may be critical to simulating the MJO in these GCMs. The evolution of the moistening profile during the transition phase was found to be a better determinant of MJO fidelity than the evolution of the heating profile.",

            "abstract": "The evaluation of coastal flooding requires the definition of the multivariate marine climate conditions (wave height, wave period, wave direction, wind, surge levels). Historical reanalysis databases are a valuable information source. However, the limited time period covered implies uncertainty in the statistical characterization of extremes. Besides, downscaling is needed to extend data to climate change scenarios or long-term historical periods, or even to understand the interannual variability. A statistical downscaling approach is adopted due to its low computational cost. The relationship between large-scale atmospheric variables (predictor) and local marine climate variables (predictand) is established by means of a physical division of the predictand based on weather types. The multivariate dependence structure of the predictand (extreme events) is introduced linking the independent marginal distributions of the variables by a probabilistic copula regression. Therefore, the climate emulator is a stochastic hybrid model with the following steps: 1) Collecting historical data for the predictor (atmospheric variables) and predictand (sea state parameters, storm-surge); 2) Predictor definition, i.e. using ESTELA method in the case of wave generation characteristics (Pérez et al., 2014a); 3) Defining the most appropriate statistical model (distribution modeling based on weather-type); 4) Stochastic simulation of the present climate; 5) Marine climate downscaling under climate change scenarios (selecting the best GCMs from CMIP5, Pérez et al., 2014b).\n",

            "abstract": "The classical approach to the modeling of stream-aquifer exchanges at the regional scale (> 10 000 km2) is a conductance model in which river stages are assumed to be constant. However, time fluctuations of river stages have a significant impact. The implementation of variable river stages in hydrological models requires parameters which are difficult to estimate at regional scale. This work aims at analyzing how the quantification of stream-aquifer exchanges at the regional scale is affected by the uncertainties on the parameterization of the process.\nA real case study (Loire basin, 90 000 km2, France) is considered. The length of the simulated river network is 16141 km, 32% of which is in contact with an underlying aquifer. The surface and groundwater flow in the basin are simulated with EauDyssée, an integrated, distributed, physically-based hydrological model. In-stream water level fluctuations are simulated using a simplified Manning-Strickler approach. Stream-aquifer exchanges are evaluated on a 17 year period (1996-2013) at the daily time step over the river network at a resolution of 1 km.\nThe spatial distributions and the time fluctuations of stream-aquifer exchanges obtained with different values of the quantities in Manning’s equation are compared with the results of the simulation with fixed river stages. The water fluxes at the stream-aquifer interface are shown to be sensitive to the approach taken for their quantification (constant or variable river stages): in-stream water level fluctuations determine temporary reversals of the gaining or losing regime for some river reaches. Moreover, the impact of the uncertainties on the input quantities of Manning’s equation is assessed.\nFinally, it is shown that the modeled stream-aquifer exchanges along the Loire are consistent with the longitudinal temperature profile estimated with the satellite based thermal infrared images (LANDSAT): the groundwater discharge into the Loire warms the river in winter and cools it in summer.",

            "abstract": "The hyporheic zone is a very complex transition zone, where interrelated hydrological and biogeochemical processes take place, mainly controlled by the exchanges of water between the stream and the surrounding riparian zone and underlying aquifer. Modeling may offer an opportunity to deepen our understanding on how these important ecosystems work. However this is only possible if hydrological and biogeochemical models are coupled to measurements that can constrain the model predictions and lead to robust estimates of the system key parameters and processes. Monitoring of the hyporheic zone faces similar problems of groundwater monitoring, often exacerbated by the strong physical biogeochemical gradients that characterize this transition area. Geophysical time-lapse techniques can provide a dynamic monitoring of the hyporheic and riparian zones.We installed in the hyporheic zone of the Vermigliana creek, Trentino, Italy, a monitoring system composed of (a) an Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) apparatus for time-lapse monitoring of electrical resistivity changes, (b) an optical fiber for DTS monitoring of temperature. The installation below the river bed was done thanks to the recent horizontal directional drilling technology capable to be remote-guided during perforation. We installed 48 electrodes below the stream,plus 24 electrodes on the top of the riparian zone, thus closing nearly entirely the region to be monitored. Parallel to the ERT cable we also installed raman technology fiber optic cable for the distributed monitoring of the subsoil temperature. We present here the results of the time-lapse measurement surveys of the first year, together with the flow/transport modeling conducted to link quantitatively the data collected to the hydraulic parameters of the system. The hyporheic zone evidences an active underflow dynamics that, to be correctly described, needs accurate distributed variably saturated flow and transport modeling.",

To estimate the role of air-sea coupling, 17 CGCMs are compared to their corresponding atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs). The climatological low-level monsoon circulation and mei-yu/changma/baiu rainfall band are improved in CGCMs from AGCMs. The improvement is at the cost of the local cold sea surface temperature (SST) biases in CGCMs, since they decrease the surface evaporation and enhance the circulation. The inter-annual EASM pattern is evaluated by a skill formula and the highest/lowest 8 models are selected to investigate the skill origins. The observed Indian Ocean (IO) warming, tropical eastern Indian Ocean (TEIO) rainfall anomalies and Kelvin wave response are captured well in high-skill models, while these features are not present in low-skill models. Further, the differences in the IO warming between high-skill and low-skill models are rooted in the preceding ENSO simulation. Hence, the IO-WPAC teleconnection is important for CGCMs, similar to AGCMs. However, compared to AGCMs, the easterly anomalies in the southern flank of the WPAC make the TEIO warmer in CGCMs by reducing the climatological monsoon westerlies and decreasing the surface evaporation. The warmer TEIO induces the stronger precipitation anomalies and intensifies the teleconnection. Hence, the inter-annual EASM pattern is better simulated in CGCMs than that in AGCMs.\nKey words: CMIP5, CGCMs, air-sea coupling, AGCMs, inter-annual EASM pattern, ENSO, IO-WPAC teleconnection",

Individual records of paleo sea-level depend not only upon the change in global ice volume, but also on the crustal deformation and gravity changes that are significant both near the glaciers and around the world. Understanding of these processes for the past is essential for interpreting the observations in order to generate better estimates for the future.\nAs part of the NERC-funded iGlass consortium, we use massive ensemble approaches to analyse sea-level changes during the last interglacial (LIG). Employing a bayesian statistical analysis, we compare the sea-level indicators to model-generated sea-level estimates. As a result we gain insight into the development of the ice sheets, the influence of the Earth deformation and the evolution of higher-than-present-day sea level during that period.\nThis contribution gives an overview of our sea-level analysis during the LIG. We focus on the uncertainties due to different selection and treatments of sea-level indicators. For example, some corals can have a large variation in depth habitat. We demonstrate that different methods of accounting for this range can influence the sea-level height estimate from the data. The analysis helps to answer questions of the effect of the uncertainties in the indicators, both in height as well as temporally, on features of the estimated global-average sea level. In particular, we address how well the data resolve sea-level oscillations during the LIG.",

In Japan, the great earthquake along the Nankai subduction zone which is expected to occur in the near future can generate large long-period ground motions in the metropolitan areas such as Osaka, Nagoya and Tokyo. To investigate the effect of accretionary prism on long-period ground motions, we performed simulations of long-period ground motions for the event (Mw 7.1) that occurred off the Kii peninsula, Japan, at 10:07 on 5 September 2004 (UTC). Our simulation model ranged from the Kinki region to the Kanto region, and included the Osaka, Nobi and Kanto basin. We calculated long-period ground motions for four types of 3-D velocity structure models: (a) model with the accretionary prism (reference model), (b) model where accretionary prism has different 3-D geometry from the reference model, (c) model with the accretionary prism whose velocity, density and Q-value are shifted, (d) model without the accretionary prism. We compared the waveforms calculated for these models and concluded that the accretionary prism along the Nankai subduction zone plays roles in reducing the amplitude of direct waves and extending the duration of coda waves. This is attributed to the trap effect of accretionary prism. Our simulation also suggested that, the edge geometry along the landward side of accretionary prism has major effects on the processes of generation and propagation of long-period ground motions.",

            "abstract": "The limited dispersal of self-propelled microorganisms and constrained nutrient transport in unsaturated soils are considered key factors in the promotion and maintenance of soil microbial diversity. Despite the importance of microbial dispersal to biogeochemical and ecological functioning of soil, little is known about how pore spaces and hydration conditions affect dispersal ranges and rates of motile bacteria. To address these questions quantitatively, we developed a novel 3-D pore network model (PNM) composed of triangular bonds connected to cubic (volumeless) bonds to mimic the salient geometrical and physical properties of natural pore spaces. Within this abstracted physical domain we employed individual based models for motile microorganisms that are capable of motion, nutrient consumption, growth and cell division. We focused on dispersal rates through the network as a function of hydration conditions through its impact on aqueous phase fragmentation that suppress nutrient diffusion (hence growth rates) and dispersal rates in good agreement with limited experimental data. Chemotactically-biased mean travel rates of microbial cells across the saturated PNM was ~3 mm/hr and decreased exponentially to 0.45 mm/hr for matric potential of (at dispersal practically ceases and cells are pinned by capillary forces). Individual-based results were upscaled to describe population scale dispersal rates, and PNM predictions considering different microbial cell sizes were in good agreement with experimental results for unsaturated soils. The role of convection for most unsaturated conditions was negligible relative to self-motility highlighting the need to constrain continuum models with respect to cell size and motility to imporve predictions of transport of motile microorganisms. The modeling platform confirms universal predictions based on percolation theory for the onset of aqueous phase fragmentation that limit dispersal and provide niches essential for species coexistence in soil pore spaces.",

            "abstract": "Both the timing of maximum extent and subsequent pace of retreat of the interconnected Eurasian (British-Irish, Scandinavian, Svalbard-Barents-Kara Sea) Ice Sheets were spatially variable likely reflecting contrasts in response to forcing mechanisms, geographical settings and glacial dynamics both between individual ice sheets and ice-sheet sectors. For example the maximum limit along the western continental shelf edge was reached up to 3,000 years earlier than the maximum, mainly terrestrial, limits in the east. We present new time-slice reconstructions of the ice-sheet evolution through the last deglaciation based on a compiled chronology of over 5,000 dates and published ice-margin positions. Ice-sheet margins are depicted every 1,000 years (25-10 kyr) and include uncertainty estimates (represented by maximum, minimum and most-credible lines). The new ice-sheet scale reconstructions summarise and provide the means for direct comparison of the empirical geological record against simulations of the deglacial ice-sheet evolution from numerical and isostatic ice-sheet modelling and the timing of abrupt events observed in deglacial climate and ocean records. The reconstruction process has identified both instances of conflicting evidence and gaps in the geological record that should be a focus for future studies. This work is part of an on-going project to reconstruct the changing limits of the Eurasian Ice Sheets through the last glacial cycle (www.uib.no/project/dated).",

            "abstract": "Mercury’s global tectonic history is thought to have been shaped by two major processes: tidal despinning and global contraction. Each process is expected to have produced a distinctive global stress field and resultant fault pattern. Data from three years of orbital operations by the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft reveal thousands of thrust faults that are attributed to global contraction, but no global signature of tidal despinning has been conclusively documented. Global contraction operated throughout an extended portion of Mercury’s geologic history, whereas tidal despinning likely operated for a shorter duration. Therefore, any tidal despinning pattern, if not entirely obliterated by the late heavy bombardment, either would have formed together with global contraction, or would have been modified by global contraction after despinning was complete. Here, we reassess global fracture patterns predicted to result from tidal despinning alone, and from a combination of tidal despinning and global contraction. We specifically make use of rock strength and deformability parameters appropriate for Mercury’s fractured lithosphere. Our results indicate that a tidal despinning pattern would consist only of a global set of opening-mode fractures (joints) in the upper part of the lithosphere, whereas the combination of tidal despinning and global contraction would have produced a global population of thrust faults, with no preferred orientations in the polar regions but with an increasing preference for north–south orientations toward the equator. If an equatorial bulge from an early state of rapid spin were supported by Mercury’s lithosphere, two end-member scenarios for the timing and duration of these two processes can be considered. In one, tidal despinning predated global contraction; in the other, tidal despinning and global contraction temporally overlapped. We test the predictions for both scenarios against the mapped distribution and orientations of Mercury’s tectonic landforms. The global pattern of thrust faults is generally consistent with predictions for the scenario under which tidal despinning and global contraction temporally overlapped.",

            "abstract": "The South America Biomass Burning Analysis (SAMBBA) took place from 14 September to 3 October 2012 during the biomass burning season. The Met Office Unified Model (MetUM), in a limited area configuration, is used to examine the impact of biomass burning aerosols (BBA) on South American weather during SAMBBA using three sensitivity experiments. The horizontal grid spacing used is 0.1o x 0.1o which corresponds to approximately 11km. Firstly we ran the MetUM without biomass emissions and aerosols, secondly with monthly mean aerosol climatologies and finally with fully prognostic aerosols modelled using the Coupled Large-scale Aerosol Simulator for Studies in Climate (CLASSIC) scheme. The CLASSIC prognostic BBA scheme only was implemented in the LAM; all other aerosol-radiative interactions from other species come from a climatology. The prognostic CLASSIC aerosol scheme has improved BBA spatial representation compared with the observations during SAMBBA. Impacts of BBA on the net radiation at surface for clear sky conditions and the top of the atmosphere are found to be approximately 50 Wm-2 and 16 Wm-2, respectively. This leads to a significant surface and skin temperature cooling of approximately 2oC due to BBA. BBA cool the boundary layer (BL) and warms air above by around 0.2oC due to the absorption of shortwave radiation, reducing BL depth by around 150m. Due to the deeper BL in the east of the domain, this leads to a more cyclonic circulation at 700 hPa with BBA, with winds changing by around 1 ms-1. Locally, on a 150 km scale, changes in the precipitation reach around 4 mm day-1 due to impacts on the location of convection, but these localised changes average out to give little change in total precipitation over the Amazonian region. Case studies simulated at 1km and using the new UKCA aerosol scheme are being evaluated with SAMBBA flight observations and will be used to evaluate BBA impacts in detail for weather events during SAMBBA.",

            "abstract": "Decreasing Arctic sea-ice cover has been observed in recent years. Recent observed changes in the arctic and mid-latitude circulation are often perceived as response to the Arctic warming. However, the magnitude of the sea-ice forced change compared to natural atmospheric internal variability still remains unclear. In this study, two versions of an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) are used to simulate the response of atmospheric circulation to the Arctic sea ice and SST anomalies of 2000’. The revised version differs from the original one only in the treatment of low-cloud: generation of low cloud is suppressed in cold condition following the work of Vavrus and Waliser (2008). A series of 120-member ensemble simulations were conducted using the two versions of the AGCM by prescribing climatological (1981–2010) and recent decade (2001–2010)’s seasonal cycle of SST and sea ice over the Arctic. Results show that the arctic atmosphere is characterized by its large internal variability. Observed arctic warming may have affected recent cold winter over mid-latitude continents, but our results suggest that its quantitative role is minor. It is also shown that simulation of atmospheric responses to arctic warming is sensitive to details of the parameterization of low cloud. The revised version simulates a negative phase of the AO when forced with the recent SST and sea ice anomalies, while the control version simulates a positive phase of the AO. The long-wave radiative feedback of low-cloud is much stronger in the revised version due to a lower mean low-cloud fraction. This difference seems to cause the contrasting atmospheric response to arctic warming.",

            "abstract": "Complex reactions between hydroxyl radicals (OH) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the lower atmosphere have a high impact on the formation/fates of airborne toxic chemicals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and particulate matter.1 Recently, air quality models have been implemented to identify OH sources, but have underpredicted OH concentrations. Studies suggest that O2 (1Δg) is produced via an energy transfer (ET) mechanism initiated by the electronic excitation of PAH and oxygenated-PAH. Energy transfer involves the formation of triplet excited state PAH which is then quenched by the surrounding ground state O2 (3∑g) resulting in excited state O2 (1Δg) formation. Excited state O2 (1Δg) is known to readily react with mono-olefins to produce organic hydroperoxides.2,3 Furthermore, the organic hydroperoxide can photodegrade to yield OH. In this study, a Nd:YAG laser coupled to a time-resolved near infrared detector was used to obtain quantum yields of O2 (1Δg) production by irradiating PAHs and oxy-PAHs at both 355 nm and 532 nm in different solvents. Select PAHs, primarily emitted by combustion engines (e.g. pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene), and their oxygenated forms (oxy-PAHs) have been identified as highly efficient O2 (1Δg) photosensitizers. For example, the measured quantum yield for pyrene in toluene was 0.90 ± 0.02. The measured quantum yields were used to calculate the photochemical rate constants for O2 (1Δg) production via ET from electronically excited PAHs and oxy-PAHs. These results were incorporated into the University of California, Irvine-California Institute of Technology (UCI-CIT) model to assess the impact on OH concentrations and the overall air quality of the South Coast Air Basin of California.\n",

            "abstract": "From some perspective the terrestrial planets of our Solar System appear very similar, for instance in their bulk composition and the differentiation in core, silicate mantle and crust. However, from other perspectives they appear significantly different, perhaps most strikingly in their current tectonic mode: while Earth is the only planet with currently ongoing plate tectonics, Venus is likely to be in a regime of episodic resurfacing. Mars features the stagnant lid mode and so might Mercury, if its mantle is still undergoing large-scale convection at all. Understanding the similarities and differences in the dynamic evolution of the different planets can thus provide important information about the conditions needed to initialize and maintain plate tectonics and shed light on the question why Earth is unique in this respect.\n Reliable constraints for planets other than Earth are difficult to make and are mostly limited to the planetary surface. However, measuring a planet’s gravity field provides one, though not unique, way to constrain the internal structure of a planet. Additionally, the planet’s moment of inertia factor and surface topography may help to limit the number of possible structures. All of these, moment of inertia, gravity and topography are reasonably well known for the terrestrial planets from various satellite missions.\n Here, we use such measurements to constrain the radial structure of the planetary mantles. Dynamic forward modeling is then used to analyze the different evolutions and dynamic features that cause the inferred structures and the resulting geoid and topography spectra to evolve. Using dynamic models also enables us to estimate the role of lateral variations, particularly in viscosity. In this first step, we focus on a comparison between the Earth and Venus.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic edifices are built rapidly, at rates far exceeding those of erosion. The resulting mechanical failure of the edifices of both active and quiescent volcanoes can result in hazards on a range of scales, from rockfall to sector collapse. The stability of a volcanic edifice depends on the ratio of its exogenous growth to mass loss due to erosion, deformation and mass wasting. Geodetic measurements of edifice spreading have mostly been associated with local zones of extension at island volcanoes and relatively few observations have been made at continental stratovolcanoes.\n We present measurements of displacement and surface property changes at Arenal, Costa Rica, a continental stratovolcano that stopped erupting in 2010 after almost 42 years of activity. High resolution TerraSAR-X data (2011-2013) have increased the area covered geodetically by ~40%, allowing us to make measurements of displacements close to Arenal’s summit for the first time. InSAR and intensity change observations provide evidence of frequent rockfalls and of shallow landslides (5-11 m thick, total volume = 1.9×107 m3 DRE). Rockfall and shallow translational landsliding have a stabilizing effect on Volcán Arenal’s edifice that reduces the potential for external triggering of slope failure. We map 16 shallow landslides (5-11 m depth, 4% of post-1968 deposits) and expect failure planes to be associated with layers of blocky debris and lava crust. Unstable material on Arenal's upper slopes is removed steadily, potentially reducing sensitivity to external triggers: the 2012 Nicoya Earthquake (Mw 7.6) had no measurable impact on the velocities of sliding units, but did result in an elevated area of rockfall. This demonstrates the importance of mass wasting for the stability of young volcanic edifices.",

While large eddy simulations are able to resolve turbulent motions at scales between several meters to several kilometers, the effects of larger and smaller scales can only be indirectly represented. In addition, microphysical processes must also be modeled.

            "abstract": "The minerals absorb and reflect thermal infrared (TIR) light of the different wavelengths depending on their composition and structure. Thus, every rock absorbs and reflects different wavelengths in TIR and has its own spectral signature. The TIR images are used in the thermal inertia mapping and in its approximation called apparent thermal inertia (ATI). We present the methodology and the high-resolution apparent thermal inertia maps for selected parts of Valles Marineris (Mars). ATI was calculated from surface albedo (A) and diurnal temperature difference (∆T) following the equation: ATI = (1 - A) / ∆T. Albedo was computed by dividing reflected radiation (IR) by incident radiation (II): A = IR / II. After introducing: II = F ∙ cosIA, where F stands for solar constant and IA for incident angle (°), it develops to: A = IR / (F ∙ cosIA). This formula allows us to calculate A on a horizontal surface. Calculating A on an inclined surface requires corrections of IA against relief characteristics (slopes, aspects): IAC = (IA - arctan(tans ∙ cos(e + t ∙ 15° - 180°))), where s is slope (°), e – aspect (°) and t – local solar time (h). A correction was made also for ∆T. The calibration process was more complex because it involved changes in incident radiation (II) over a given time interval (∆T = T13:00 - T6:00). II is a function of: Martian tilt, eccentricity, perihelium longitude, solar longitude (Ls, in °), latitude (φ, in °), local solar time and relief characteristics. Total II, integrated over the time interval, can be calculated following the equation [1]. The results were compared to the existing thermal inertia maps of Mars.",

The model takes into account radial, energy, pitch-angle and mixed diffusion, losses into the atmosphere, and magnetopause shadowing. We consider the energetic (>100 KeV), relativistic (~0.5-1 MeV) and ultra-relativistic (>2 MeV) electrons. One year of relativistic electron measurements (μ=700 MeV/G) from October 1, 2012 to October 1, 2013 are well reproduced by the simulation during a period of the various geomagnetic activity. However, for ultra-relativistic energies (μ=3500 MeV/G), the VERB code simulation overestimates electron phase space density (PSD). These results indicate that an additional loss mechanism is operational and efficient for these high energies. We discuss possible solutions for improving the modeling of the radiation belts dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic activities release various gaseous and particulate substances into the Earth’s atmosphere affecting air quality and climate. The greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) are particularly important drivers of man-made climate change while ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO) and aerosols are major players in tropospheric photochemistry controlling air quality. Once released to the atmosphere the fate of man-made pollutants and climate forcers is controlled by natural removal processes.\nWe present the mission concept of the Geostationary Emission Explorer for Europe (G3E). G3E primarily aims at accurately measuring CO2 and CH4 column-average concentrations across Europe with spatial and temporal resolution of a few kilometers and a few hours, respectively. Such spatiotemporally dense imaging of the greenhouse gas concentration fields above Europe is expected to boost our ability to disentangle anthropogenic emissions from natural source and sink processes and to impose unprecedented observational constraints on surface flux quantification. In support of the retrieval and interpretation of greenhouse gas concentrations, G3E’s grating spectrometers cover a wide spectral range from the visible into the shortwave infrared. This facilitates estimates of column-average O3, CO, and aerosol abundances providing extra information on air-quality from a geostationary view. A flexible pointing design further allows for selecting focus regions beyond the European continent in order to address the surface flux budgets of other regions of interest such as tropical Africa. We demonstrate G3E’s capabilities in terms of prospective instrument design, observation concept, and retrieval performance.",

We present a probabilistic framework for inversion of depth, moment tensor and moment rate (source time function) from teleseismic P and SH waveforms. The results are to be compiled into a global Bayesian earthquake catalogue.\nBayesian inference from waveforms crucially depends on the noise model. Since we consider the assumption of sample-wise normally distributed noise unrealistic, we opt for a waveform misfit criterion. In order to establish its statistical properties in the presence of noise and realistic modelling errors, we harness a database of 1800 deterministic source solutions to derive the parameters of the Likelihood function needed in Bayesian inference.\nThe inversion scheme itself uses the Neighbourhood Algorithm to infer a statistical ensemble of source solutions. These can for example be used to infer the influence of source uncertainty on the input parameters for seismic waveform tomography, such as cross-correlation traveltimes.",

            "abstract": "Paleoclimate proxy data at the glacial period shows high salinity of more than 37.0 psu in the deep South Atlantic. At the same time, data also indicate that the residence time of the water mass was more than 3000 years. These data implies that the stratification by salinity was stronger in the deep Southern Ocean (SO) in the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Previous studies using Ocean General Circulation Model (OGCM) fail to explain the low glacial atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration at LGM. The reproducibility of salinity and water mass age is considered insufficient in these OGCMs, which may in turn affect the reproducibility of the atmospheric CO2concentration. In coarse-resolution OGCMs, The deep water is formed by unrealistic open-ocean deep convection in the SO. Considering these facts, we guessed previous studies using OGCM underestimated the salinity and water mass age at LGM.\nThis study investigate the role of the enhanced stratification in the glacial SO on the variation of atmospheric CO2 concentration by using OGCM. In order to reproduce the recorded salinity of the deep water, relaxation of salinity toward value of recorded data is introduced in our OGCM simulations. It was found that deep water formation in East Antarctica is required for explaining the high salinity in the South Atlantic. In contrast, it is difficult to explain the glacial water mass age, even if we assume the situation vertical mixing is very weak in the SO. Contrary to previous estimate, the high salinity of the deep SO resulted in increase of Antarctic Bottom water (AABW) flow and decrease the residence time of carbon in the deep ocean, which increased atmospheric CO2 concentration. On the other hand, the weakening of the vertical mixing in the SO contributed to increase the vertical gradient of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), which decreased atmospheric CO2 concentration.\nAdding the contribution of the enhanced stratification in the glacial SO, we obtained larger reduction in atmospheric CO2 concentration than previous studies. However, we still fail to explain the full amplitude of recorded glacial reduction of atmospheric CO2 concentration. The carbonate compensation process, which is not incorporated in our simulations, might be required for further reduction in atmospheric CO2 concentration.",

            "abstract": "Spatial, kinematical and magnitude characteristics of induced seismicity occurring during different fluid-injection stages are investigated using a high-resolution hypocenter catalog of a prominent cluster of induced seismicity at the northwestern part of The Geysers geothermal field. There, changes of the stress field orientation and relative stress magnitude were identified during two peak-injections in a previous study. These observations were interpreted as an effect of the increase in pore pressure and horizontal stress magnitudes at reservoir depth during the peak-injections.\nStudying the characteristics of this seismicity cluster in detail we find that during peak-injections seismicity occurs at greater distances from the injection point, mainly towards the north-east, i.e. parallel to the maximum horizontal stress orientation. In contrast, during lower injection rates seismicity migrates dominantly to the south and concentrates closer to the injection point. Fault plane solutions show that during peak-injection intervals the percentage of strike-slip and/or thrust faulting events increases and the seismic moment released by the strike-slip events is higher on average than that of normal faulting events. The b values decrease during peak-injections, suggesting the increase in differential stresses at the reservoir during these periods.\nThe observed differences in the seismicity characteristics during the different injection stages could be related to variable influence of physical mechanisms inducing seismicity. Prior to peak-injections, the seismicity might be predominantly connected with the thermal fracturing of the reservoir rock. However, during peak injections, the limited pore pressure increase (~1MPa) may play a significant role, even though pore pressure remains under hydrostatic values. By estimating the reservoir permeability and the thermal and hydraulic diffusivities, we confirm that the pore pressure propagation front reaches a greater distance from the injection point than the corresponding thermal propagation front.",

            "abstract": "The aim of this work is to investigate whether measurements of self-potential (SP) can be used to monitor seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers with application to the fractured UK chalk aquifer. The SP arises to maintain electrical neutrality when a separation of charge occurs due to gradients in pressure (electrokinetic (EK) potential) and concentration (exclusion-diffusion (ED) potential).\nWe have installed a borehole monitoring array near Brighton on the UK south coast comprising 14 electrodes and 3 FEC/T/P (conductivity/temperature/pressure) probes. Variations in head suggest that short-term changes in the borehole are controlled by semi-diurnal and fortnightly tidal cycles. FEC suggests that salinity is governed by the inland freshwater head. SP monitoring reveals semi-diurnal and diurnal fluctuations which are observed without any saline water entering the borehole.\nLaboratory measurements to investigate the contribution of the EK and ED potentials to the overall SP indicate that tidally-driven changes in head at the borehole generate an EK potential fluctuation of c.260μV. This is not sufficient to explain the c.2mV semi-diurnal SP signal observed. Therefore, the ED potential across the saline front is suggested to be the main mechanism generating the tidal SP response at the borehole. In this model, which is currently being tested numerically, the SP response is caused by the tidally-driven lateral movement of the saline front within the aquifer.\nSaline water was observed to enter the borehole in August 2013. Prior to this a systematic increase in the SP of c.300μV was observed, starting c.5 days before saline water breakthrough. In this case saline water entered the well owing to a seasonal decrease in inland head; however, the results suggest that SP could also provide early warning of saline water breakthrough in abstraction wells, allowing for improved management of abstraction rates from coastal aquifers.",

Here, we present a paleomagnetic investigation of the Jurassic (carbonates) to Lower Cretaceous (volcaniclastic rocks) Wölong section of the Tibetan Himalaya in the Everest region. The carbonates yield positive fold tests, suggesting that the remanent magnetizations have a pre-folding origin. However, detailed paleomagnetic analyses, rock magnetic tests, end-member modeling of acquisition curves of isothermal remanent magnetization, and petrographic studies reveal that the magnetic carrier of the Jurassic carbonates is authigenic magnetite, whereas the dominant magnetic carrier of the Lower Cretaceous volcaniclastic rocks is detrital magnetite. We conclude that the Jurassic carbonates were remagnetized, whereas the Lower Cretaceous volcaniclastics retain a primary remanence. We hypothesize that remagnetization of the Jurassic carbonates was probably caused by the oxidation of early diagenetic pyrite to magnetite within the time interval at ~86-84 Ma during the latest Cretaceous Normal Superchron and earliest deposition of Cretaceous oceanic red beds in the Tibetan Himalaya.\nThe remagnetization of the limestones prevents determining the size of ‘Greater India’ during Jurassic time. Instead, a paleolatitude of the Tibetan Himalaya of 23.8±2.1° S at ~86-84 Ma is suggested. This value is lower than the expected paleolatitude of India from apparent polar wander path (APWP). The volcaniclastic rocks with the primary remanence, however, yielded a Lower Cretaceous paleolatitude of Tibetan Himalaya of 55.5±3° S, fitting well with the APWP of India.",

Here we present dissolved and biogenic Si isotope signatures at 9 shelf stations in the upwelling area off Peru obtained during RV Meteor cruise M93 in February 2013 in the frame of the German SFB 754 project to better understand the processes influencing the Si isotope distributions. Primary productivity in the upwelling area of Peru is dominated by diatoms, which preferentially incorporate the lighter 28Si when building their frustules thus leaving seawater enriched in 30Si. Previous studies have suggested that the fractionation factors accompanying this process are species dependent ranging from -0.5‰ to -2.1‰ and that the dissolved Si isotope signature off Peru is strongly influenced by water mass mixing resulting in less fractionated surface water signatures during strong upwelling. To disentangle these processes, information on the Si isotope composition of dissolved and particulate Si is compared with that of the corresponding diatom assemblages. Si isotope signatures of particulate samples are consistently lower than the surrounding seawater ranging from 1‰ to 2‰ (±0.2 2sd). The highest fractionation factors between bSiO2 and Si(OH)4 (ΔbSiO2-SI(OH)4) in surface waters are found at the lowest Si(OH)4 concentrations with an average fractionation factor of -0.9‰, which agrees well with previously reported values. Diatom species effects do not seem to exert a major influence on the isotope signature of the biogenic silica, which instead appears to be mainly controlled by fractionation during biological uptake and water mass mixing.",

            "abstract": "Designs of deep geological repositories for spent nuclear fuel include several levels of confinement. The Swedish and Finnish concept KBS-3 targets for example sparsely fractured crystalline bedrock as host formation and would have the waste canisters embedded in an engineered buffer of compacted MX-80 bentonite. The host rock is a highly heterogeneous dual porosity material containing fractures and a rock matrix. Bentonite is a complex expansive porous material. Its water content and mechanical properties are interdependent. Beyond the specific physics of unsaturated flow and transport in each medium, the interface between them is critical. Detailed knowledge of the transitory two-phase flow regime, induced by the insertion of the unsaturated buffer in a saturated rock environment, is necessary to assess the performance of planned KBS-3 deposition holes.\nA set of numerical simulations based on the equations of two-phase flow for water and air in porous media were conducted to investigate the dynamics of air and groundwater flow near the rock/bentonite interface in the period following installation of the unsaturated bentonite buffer. We assume state of the two-phase flow parameter values for bentonite from laboratory water uptake tests and typical fracture and rock properties from the Äspö Hard rock laboratory (Sweden) gathered under several field characterization campaigns. The results point to desaturation of the rock domain as far as 10 cm away from the interface into matrix-dominated regions for up to 160 days. Similar observations were made during the Bentonite Rock Interaction Experiment (BRIE) at the Äspö HRL, with a desaturation sustained for even longer times. More than the mere time to mechanical and hydraulic equilibrium, the occurrence of sustained unsaturated conditions opens the possibility for biogeochemical processes that could be critical in the safety assessment of the planned repository.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have suggested that geodetic locking at convergent plate boundaries is closely related to slip distribution of subsequent megathrust earthquakes. The nature of locking and its evolution towards rupture, however, remains a matter of debate. The international initiative IPOC (Integrated Plate Boundary Observatory Chile; ipoc-network.org) addresses these goals at the Chilean margin. We explore geophysical and geodetic data collected in the decade before an event to identify the petrophysical state as well as change along the plate interface leading up to a megathrust event.\nSeismological data exhibit well defined changes of reflectivity and Vp/Vs ratio along the plate interface that released the M=8.8Maule earthquake of 2010. High Vp/Vs domains, interpreted as zones of elevated pore fluid pressure, spatially correlate with lower locking degree, and exhibit higher background seismicity as expected for partly creeping domains. In turn, unstable slip associated to a higher degree of locking is promoted in lower pore fluid pressure domains. We speculate that hydraulic loading during the terminal stage of a seismic cycle to close to lithostatic pore pressure with an equivalent reduction of effective strength may be as relevant for earthquake triggering as stress loading from long-term plate convergence.\nIn contrast to the Maule earthquake, the Pisagua Mw=8.1 earthquake of 2014, while also rupturing a geodetically well-defined major asperity, was preceded by a protracted series of foreshocks. Since July 2013 three seismic clusters hit this part of the plate boundary with increasing magnitudes in a domain that was transitional between a fully locked and a creeping portion. Leading up to this earthquake the b-value of the foreshocks gradually dropped during the years prior to the earthquake, reversing its trend a few days before the Pisagua earthquake. We conclude that gradual weakening of the central part of the Northern Chile seismic gap accentuated by the foreshock activity in a zone of intermediate seismic coupling was instrumental in causing final failure. In spite of similar geodynamic conditions, processes leading up to the rupture were distinct for the Pisagua and the Maule earthquake suggesting a diversity of evolutionary paths towards megathrust rupture.",

Despite valuable existing skills in hydrologic modeling the accounting for anthropogenic actions in current models remains limited. The emerging availability of datasets containing measured dam outflows and reported irrigation withdrawals motivates their inclusion into simulations of flow in river networks. However, the development of advanced river network models accounting for such datasets of anthropogenic influences requires a detailed data model and a thorough handling of the various data types, sources and time scales. This contribution details the development of a consistent data model suitable for accounting some observations of anthropogenic modifications of the surface water cycle and presents the impact of such inclusion on simulations using the Routing Application for Parallel computatIon of Discharge (RAPID).",

            "abstract": "Spatial evolution of transient ionospheric convection induced by sudden impulses (SIs) recorded by ground magnetometers is studied statistically by using SuperDARN (SD) data. An advantage of using SD data instead of ground magnetic fields is that ionospheric flows measured by the radars are not virtually biased by the spatially-varying ionospheric conductance or the magnetospheric currents. First we surveyed the Sym-H index for Jan., 2007 to Dec., 2012 to identify SI events with a peak amplitude |dSym-H| greater than 10 nT. Next we searched all SD data over the northern hemisphere during the SI events for ionospheric backscatters which give us the light-of-sight velocity of horizontal ionospheric flows. For each SI event, the collected ionospheric flow data were sorted into the four periods: the pre-SI period, the pre-Main Impulse (MI), middle-MI, and post-MI periods. In the present study, we examine the differences in flow velocity between the pre-SI period and the three MI periods to clarify how ionospheric flows change in association with SIs. As a result, the ionospheric flow shifts eastward on the dusk side and westward on the dawn side at the higher latitudes during positive SIs (SI+), while it shows a roughly westward/eastward shift on the dusk/dawn side, respectively, during negative SIs (SI-). These polarities of flow shifts are basically consistent with the higher latitude portions of the DP current for the MI phase as shown by Araki [1994] and Araki and Nagano [1988]. In terms of temporal evolution, the SI-induced transient flows remain slightly longer for SI- than for SI+. These findings suggest that the compression and expansion of the magnetosphere affect in different manners the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupled convection system.",

In large parts of the world, real time ground-based observations of precipitation are sparse and satellite derived precipitation products provides a solution.\nWe used changes in satellite derived soil moisture (SM) and land surface temperature (LST) to reduce uncertainties in the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis product – Real Time (TMPA-RT). The Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC-model) was used to model the response of LST and SM on precipitation and a particle filter was used to update TMPA-RT. Observations from AMSR-E (LPRM and LSMEM), ASCAT, SMOS and LST from AMSR-E were used to correct TMPA-RT over the continental United States. The corrections in TMPA-RT were evaluated against NLDAS-2 precipitation dataset. A synthetic experiment showed the potential of both SM and LST observations to reduce uncertainties in TMPA-RT.\nCorrections with SM observations reduced the false alarm rate (FAR) from 0.09 to 0.01 and the error in the retrieved rainfall volumes per event. The probability of rainfall detection (POD) was reduced compared to the original TMPA-RT product (0.46 to 0.34). Noise in the retrieved SM changes resulted in a relatively low potential to reduce uncertainties.\nCorrection with LST observations resulted in an increased POD (0.46 to 0.51) and reduce FAR (0.09 to 0.03), indicating an improved rainfall detection skill. Additionally, an improved Brier Score (BS) was found after correction (0.32 to 0.26). The annual precipitation totals after correction with LST were closer to the observed precipitation. When both soil moisture and LST observations were combined, results showed no significant improvement compared to original TMPA-RT.\nThis study show the potential for reducing the uncertainties in TMPA-RT estimates over sparsely gauged areas where TMPA-RT is used for monitoring and forecasting of floods and drought.",

TOMS and OMI satellite data are used to estimate the upper limit of injected SO2-mass and the location of the volcano while the spatial distribution of the SO2 plume some days after the eruption is taken taken from MIPAS on ENVISAT. A comparison of simulated stratospheric optical depth with the timeseries of values observed by SAGE and OSIRIS at different latitudes shows that it is important to include every low latitude volcano that reaches more than about 15km altitude, but also big midlatitude ones where injection heights above about 13km matter for the global stratosphere. Our simulations also show that organic and black carbon from biomass burning contribute significantly to extinction and radiative heating in the lower stratosphere. Despite its optimization for the stratosphere concerning the size distributions, the aerosol module approximately reproduces the observed total optical depth and the distribution of the different aerosol types in the troposphere.\nThis study is part of the SPARC SSIRC activities.",

            "abstract": "It has been suggested that the presence of frazil ice can lead to a conditional instability in seawater. Any frazil forming in the water column reduces the bulk density of a parcel of frazil-seawater mixture, causing it to rise. Due to the pressure-decrease in the freezing point, this causes more frazil to form, causing the parcel to accelerate, and so on. We use a primitive-equation ocean model to study this instability. We find that frazil ice growth caused by rising of supercooled water is indeed able to generate a buoyancy-driven instability. Even in a gravitationally stable water column, the frazil ice mechanism can still generate the convection. The instability does not operate in the presence of strong density stratification, high thermal driving (warm water), a small initial perturbation, high background mixing or the prevalence of large frazil ice crystals. The instability is not necessarily expressed in frazil ice at all times; an initial frazil perturbation may melt into a freshwater perturbation that drives re-growth of ice. Given a large enough initial perturbation this instability can allow significant ice growth. A model shows frazil ice growth in an Ice Shelf Water plume several kilometres from an ice shelf, under similar conditions to observations of frazil ice growth under sea ice. The presence of this instability could be a factor affecting the growth of sea ice near ice shelves, with implications for AABW formation.",

            "abstract": "Accurate earthquake source parameters are essential for any tsunami hazard assessment and mitigation, including early warning systems. Complex tectonic setting makes the a priori accurate assumptions of earthquake source parameters difficult and characterization of the faulting type is a challenge. Information on tsunamigenic sources is of crucial importance in the Eastern Mediterranean and its Connected Seas, especially considering the short arrival times and lack of offshore sea-level measurements. In addition, the scientific community have had to abandon the paradigm of a ‘‘maximum earthquake’’ predictable from simple tectonic parameters (Ruff and Kanamori, 1980) in the wake of the 2004 Sumatra event (Okal, 2010) and one of the lessons learnt from the 2011 Tohoku event was that tsunami hazard maps may need to be prepared for infrequent gigantic earthquakes as well as more frequent smaller-sized earthquakes (Satake, 2011). We have initiated an extensive modeling study to perform a deterministic Tsunami Hazard Analysis for the Eastern Mediterranean and its Connected Seas. Characteristic earthquake source parameters (strike, dip, rake, depth, Mwmax) at each 0.5° x 0.5° size bin for 0-40 km depth (total of 310 bins) and for 40-100 km depth (total of 92 bins) in the Eastern Mediterranean, Aegean and Black Sea region (30°N-48°N and 22°E-44°E) have been assigned from the harmonization of the available databases and previous studies. These parameters have been used as input parameters for the deterministic tsunami hazard modeling. Nested Tsunami simulations of 6h duration with a coarse (2 arc-min) and medium (1 arc-min) grid resolution have been simulated at EC-JRC premises for Black Sea and Eastern and Central Mediterranean (30°N-41.5°N and 8°E-37°E) for each source defined using shallow water finite-difference SWAN code (Mader, 2004) for the magnitude range of 6.5 – Mwmax defined for that bin with a Mw increment of 0.1. Results show that not only the earthquakes resembling the well-known historical earthquakes such as AD 365 or AD 1303 in the Hellenic Arc, but also earthquakes with lower magnitudes do constitute to the tsunami hazard in the study area.",

            "abstract": "PP underside reflections off upper mantle discontinuities are frequently used to map discontinuity topography, impedance contrasts and to interpret these with respect to thermal and/or mineralogical variations. While the seismic discontinuities at 410 km and 660 km depth should be a global feature, several events show no detections or reduced amplitudes of the precursors. In this study, we investigate effects of topography on upper mantle discontinuities on array detections of PP precursors. Using the 2.5-D axisymmetric finite difference technique PSVaxi, we compute P-SV synthetic seismograms for two-dimensional model geometries with correct 3-D geometrical spreading. Retaining dominant periods of ~ 2 s, we investigate Gaussian-shaped upward or downward deflections of the 660 km discontinuity with varying lateral dimensions. Furthermore, we investigate effects of double discontinuities at ~660 km depth which are due to phase transformations in the non-olivine component of the mantle at subduction zone temperatures. Analyses of travel residuals indicate that topography of downward deflections of discontinuities is underestimated by 10 to 20 km while upward deflections are recovered within 10 km. Amplitude measurements show focussing and defocussing of PP precursor amplitudes by 60-70%. Reduced amplitudes of PP precursors are close or below the average noise level at seismic arrays and could result in non-detections. Double discontinuities at 660 km depth are recovered for lateral dimensions larger than 10° and if the two discontinuities are separated by at least 20 km. The observed effects in synthetic seismograms raise caution for interpretation of PP precursors in terms of impedance contrasts as well as thermal and mineralogical variations in the mantle.",

In the ocean, macroalgae, phytoplankton, and bacteria are considered to be the main producers of VOCs. Recent investigations have shown that marine bacteria produce halomethanes such as chloromethane, bromomethane, and iodomethane. However, knowledge of aquatic VOC production, particularly through bacteria, is lacking. We studied the production of VOCs, including halomethanes, through the bacterium HKF-1. HKF-1 was isolated from brackish water in Sanaru Lake, Shizuoka prefecture, Japan. The bacterium belongs to the α-proteobacteria. Bacteria were incubated in marine broth 2216 (Difco) added with KI and KIO3 (each at 0.02 μmol/L) at 25°C. VOCs in the gas phase above the cultured samples was determined using a dynamic headspace (GESTEL DHS)—gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890N)—mass spectrometer (Agilent 5975C) at 0, 4, 7, 10 and 12 incubation days. In addition, the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) was measured during the culture period. Measurement of VOCs showed that chloromethane, bromomethane, iodomethane, isoprene, methanethiol, dimethyl sulfide, and dimethyl disulfide were produced in the culture of HKF-1. Dihalomethanes and trihalomethanes, such as dibromomethane, chloroiodomethane, bromoiodomethane, and tribromomethane, were not detected. Given that monohalomethanes and sulfur-containing VOCs were abundant in the culture, HKF-1 is one of the possible candidates as a producer of monohalomethane and sulfur-containing VOCs in marine environment, but not of di- or trihalomethanes.",

            "abstract": "Gofar transform fault on the East Pacific Rise can be subdivided into multiple patches that slip during magnitude 5.5-6 earthquakes roughly every five years. It is noted that, however, these patches are separated by stationary rupture barriers that prevent ruptures propagating through. In 2008, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) deployed an ocean bottom seismography (OBS) array for 1-year continuous measurements, which successfully captured the 18 September 2008 Mw 6.0 earthquake as well as its fore- and aftershocks. Previous studies showed that along-strike seismicity has apparent segmentation and quasi-period.\nTo better understand the relationship of structural variations and earthquake rupture properties along the Gofar transform fault, we use P and S first arrival times from 3874 earthquakes selected from this survey to determine three-dimensional Vp, Vs and Vp/Vs models and earthquake locations using a modified double-difference seismic tomography code tomoDDSP. Compared to tomoDD, tomoDDSP provides a more robust estimation of Vp/Vs model, which is a useful indicator of lithology and pore fluid pressure. In addition to the catalog picks, more accurate waveform cross-correlation data is also used in our inversion.\nOverall, our result shows clear Vp/Vs segmentation along the fault strike. For each segment, the associated seismicity also shows different patterns. For the mainshock zone of the 2008 Mw 6.0 earthquake, it is associated with high Vp/Vs anomalies (1.7-2.1) and the seismicity is concentrated within a narrow zone around the depth 7 km. The adjacent eastern and western zones are associated with low Vp/Vs anomalies (<1.6), where in addition to the concentration of seismicity around 7 km depth there is also some seismicity distributed all over the upper crust. Further to the east, the foreshock zone identified in previous studies is associated with higher Vp/Vs anomalies with most of seismicity diffusively located above 7 km. To the west of the foreshock zone, a clear low velocity zone extending deep to 10 km is imaged, which could act as a barrier for the rupture propagating from the mainshock zone to the foreshock zone. The cause of the Vp/Vs anomalies will be further investigated, which could help explain the distribution pattern of seismicity and rupture patches along the strike.",

They are known as very geoeffective events, capable to trigger strong storms in the terrestrial environment. Statistical studies that address their geoeffectiveness show dependence on their orientation in the interplanetary medium, on preceding or trailing events, … Before interacting with the magnetosphere, they cross the terrestrial bow shock and the magnetosheath. From CLUSTER observations in the magnetosheath, we show that their magnetic structure can be similar or modified downstream of the bow shock, and in some cases it presents a large rotation relative to upstream direction. The orientation of the magnetic field and in particular the orientation of the Bz component is crucial for the development of geomagnetic activity inside the magnetosphere. From observations and from simple modeling, we examine the configurations where the terrestrial bow shock is responsible for a modification of the clouds' magnetic field orientation and even for its reversal. We show that this depends on the configuration quasi-parallel/quasi-perpendicular at the shock and discuss the possible consequences for the geomagnetic activity.",

            "abstract": "For applying the real-time prediction of ground motion proposed by Hoshiba (2013a, JGR) to Earthquake Early Warning, it is necessary to correct a site amplification factor in an observed waveform. In this study, we aim to estimate site amplification factors at whole area of Japan, and apply the real-time correction proposed by Hoshiba (2013b, BSSA) of site amplification factors to investigate their validity.\n To estimate site amplification factors, we used the spectral ratio of direct S-wave at two adjunct stations. We constructed a network with many pairs of stations, then solved the equations of the network in a least square sense. As a result, we successfully estimated site amplification factors almost whole of the Japan area, except a part of Hokkaido and Kyushu region, and Islands area.\n Next, we applied the real-time correction of site amplification factors in the observed waveforms of the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake (Mw 9.0). Distribution of site-corrected seismic intensity calculated in time domain (Kunugi et al., 2008) showed clear distance-dependent relation of seismic intensity, which was not found in the distribution of non-corrected seismic intensity.\n Finally, we compared the two waveforms recorded in the Ishikari Plain, Hokkaido region, Japan, with correction of site amplification factors. The features of waveform in one station was well reproduced from the waveform of other station with the correction of site amplification factor.\n Although there are some subjects, e.g. nonlinear behavior of the ground with strong ground motion and azimuth dependency of site amplification factors which are not considered in this study, estimated site amplification factors in this study is effective in real-time prediction of ground motion.",

            "abstract": "SKB has submitted a license application for a spent nuclear fuel repository at Forsmark sited in crystalline rocks of the Fennoscandian shield. In support of this application various quantitative assessments were made to demonstrate the long-term safety of the proposed repository. One such assessment involved simulation of groundwater chemical evolution to quantify impacts on safety functions for the disposal system related to the geochemical conditions, particularly salinity, pH and redox conditions. In the reference case the current temperate period lasts until 12,000 AD. A case of prolonged meteoric infiltration to 60,000 AD is also considered resulting from e.g. global warming. This is to fulfil a regulatory request to assess whether extended dilute water infiltration might lead to a rise in redox potential and also to an increase in erosion of the bentonite barrier due to formation of colloids. In order to perform long transient simulations of groundwater flow and solute transport with water-solute-rock interactions, new tools have been developed to closely couple geochemical, groundwater flow and transport calculations, and perform these efficiently using parallel computing techniques. In assessing this case, sensitivities are tested to the geochemical reaction schemes appropriate to the site. The results of this work predict that the chemical environment at repository depth stabilises at around 20,000 AD and shows little change beyond that. The salinity of the groundwater is governed by the low permeability (c. 10-19 m2) of the bedrock and by rock matrix diffusion, resulting in relatively shallow and slow circulation of groundwater. The chemical reactions influence concentrations of reactive species, the calculated pH and redox potential. In particular, the redox reactions thought to be relevant for the Forsmark site maintain reducing conditions at repository depth, even with infiltration at the ground surface of meteoric water with relatively high redox potential.",

            "abstract": "This study addresses the petrological and geochemical variations of eudialyte and related phases in kakortokites from the ~1.16 Ga Ilímaussaq Complex, S Greenland. The kakortokites form a suite of rhythmically layered agpaitic nepheline syenites, highly enriched in REE, Zr, Nb, Ta (HFSE) and halogens (F, Cl). Instead of containing common HFSE-phases such as zircon or titanite, agpaitic rocks exhibit complex Na-Zr-Ti-silicates, e.g. eudialyte and rinkite. To gain further insight in the crystallisation parameters and layering forming processes in agpaitic systems, we performed major and trace-element analyses on cumulus eudialyte. The data reveal complex compositional zoning patterns, including hour-glass sector-zoning, sub-µm scale oscillatory zoning and core-rim relationships. The latter were explored to identify subtle trends in the chemical evolution and in-situ fractionation of the liquids from which they crystallised. Most crystals exhibit a general rimward increase in REE concentrations (1.0-1.3 wt% Ce203 and 0.5-0.7 wt% La2O3), which is consistent with REE enrichment in the fractionating bulk magma. Similarly, Ba contents significantly increase towards the rims (300-900 ppm), while Cl (1.0-1.6 wt%), Rb (7-20 ppm) and Pb (60-160 ppm) decrease. In few cases, crystals exhibit partial rims with relatively low REE contents (~0.5 wt% RE2O3), which is in contrast with the general core-rim trend in the euhedral cores. These particular eudialyte segments are tentatively interpreted as crystallites from inter-cumulate melt, which underwent a chemical evolution distinctly different from that of the bulk magma. The decrease in REE contents may reflect the introduction of new REE-phases at the inter-cumulus stage, such as rinkite-group minerals, which contain ~20 wt% RE2O3 and occur interstitial to the major cumulus minerals feldspar, nepheline, arfvedsonite and eudialyte. Hour-glass sector zoning in the euhedral eudialyte cores involves small variations (< 0.1 wt%) in Nb, Ce and La concentrations between coevally grown crystal sectors. These compositional heterogeneities are related to preferential incorporation of Nb and REE on a specific set of growth surfaces and could provide important clues to the diffusion mechanisms in agpaitic magmas.",

            "abstract": "Episodic tremor and slip occurred just before the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake on a shallow portion (less than 20 km depth) in the Tohoku subduction zone (Ito et al., 2013). The area where slow slip occurred overlapped with the seismogenic zone. To understand such diverse slip behaviour around the Japan Trench, not only the major earthquakes but also the slow slip events, it is essential to reveal the frictional properties of rocks distributed at the Tohoku subduction zone. We thus conducted friction experiments using a rotary shear apparatus on smectite-rich pelagic sediments retrieved from the plate-boundary thrust during IODP Expedition 343. The sediments were disaggregated and simulated gouges were then sheared at temperatures of 20-200oC, an effective normal stress of 50 MPa and a pore fluid pressure of 50 MPa. We conducted velocity-stepping sequences (0.3 to 100 µm/s) to determine the rate and state parameter (a-b) and investigated the effects of temperature and slip rate on slip stability.\nOur results show that at low temperatures of 20 and 50oC, the simulated gouges exhibit negative values of (a-b) with a background friction coefficient of 0.38, except at the highest slip rate of 0.1 mm/s. However, the gouges show neutral to positive values of (a-b) at temperatures of >100oC with the same background friction coefficient as at lower temperatures. In addition, the value of parameter (a-b) depends significantly on slip rates: at temperatures of 20 and 50oC it increases from negative to neutral (or slightly positive at 20oC) with increasing slip rates to 0.1 mm/s, whereas it tends to decrease with increasing slip rate at temperatures higher than 100oC. The downdip temperature limit of the slow slip events at Japan Trench (Ito et al., 2013) seems to be in the range between 100 to 150oC. The transition in (a-b) value from neutral to positive, particularly at lower slip rates, occurs at the same temperature range. Hence, this could correspond to the observed downdip limit of the slow slip events. Furthermore, at the lowest temperature of 20oC this transition also occurs, but with increasing slip rate. This frictional property may thus inhibit further slip acceleration even if the slip commences, and could thus represent the upper limit of slow slip events at the shallow portion of the plate boundary.",

            "abstract": "Fracture-fluid flow coupling is critical for understanding society-relevant energy sources such as Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), hydrocarbon extraction via hydraulic fracture, and carbon capture and storage (CCS). Although fluid-rock interactions are one of the most important processes in lithospheric geodynamics, they are one of the most difficult to properly simulate because of the orders-of-magnitude changes in hydraulic properties at the onset of fracture or slip. These large-scale changes in hydraulic properties result in the locally rapid flow that is likely to react with their new surroundings. Advances in modeling these processes must properly modeling the evolution of fracture networks coupled to the hydraulic (and thermodynamic) properties within the advecting, over-pressured, and reactive system.\nMany THM simulators exist but with limited utility because their inherently low resolution do not allow for the development of evolving fracture networks. A promising approach to modeling is to develop algorithms written in the CUDA programming language and optimized for computations using the inherently parallel Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) computer architecture. We are developing such a model, with target resolutions on the order of 1000x1000x 500. This simulator models a pore-elastic-thermo-elastic-plastic rheology that includes hardening, softening, and damage, and coupled to a non-linear diffusion model of fluid pressure and a 2-phase fluid (water and gas). Both tensile and shear fractures evolve in response to far-field stresses, local stress perturbations associated with both shear and tensile fractures, and thermo-elastic and pore-elastic stresses. The advantage of this model over existing models is that the governing equations have been reformulated to run on a GPU cluster.\nResults from numerical experiments show that this approach has great potential to study fluid-rock interactions at all scales. In this talk, I summarize the progress to date and future plans, and show that a GPU-based modeling approach is fast, high-resolution, and can reproduce experimental results of fluid injection experiments with numerical resolution at the grain-scale of the experiment.",

            "abstract": "The role of sea ice in the Earth climate system is poorly defined, although its influence albedo, ocean circulation and atmosphere-ocean heat and gas exchange, in particular there is lack of information about its behaviour in the past. Different approaches have been proposed and used for the past reconstruction of sea ice. Attention has been given to sediment core in which measurement of diatomean assemblage has been discovered to respond to sea ice fluctuations. Recently a class of compounds, the highly branched isoprenoids (in particular the IP25) have been proposed as possible tracers for past sea ice extension. Other strategies have been used to evaluate the sea ice changes, for example multy-proxy approach (Kinnard et al. 2011) but for ice cores the question is still open. Sodium (Na) and Methanesulphonic acid (MSA) are now suggested as possible proxy. Sodium reflects glacial-interglacial sea ice variability but on shorter timescales is strongly influenced by meteorology (Levine et al. 2014). Methanesulphonic Acid, correlates with satellite observations of sea ice extent off the East Antarctic coast, but is reactive and remobilized in ice cores over centennial time scales (Curran, et al. 2003; Rothlisberger et al. 2010). In parallel we propose iodine and bromine, as a possible tracers for past sea ice changes. Bromine is actively involved in destruction chemistry of polar ozone via auto-catalyzed reactions called “Bromine explosions”, which occur above seasonal sea ice and causing an excess of bromine in the snow deposition compared to the sea water ratio. Iodine is emitted from algal communities growing under sea ice and then, percolating up to the sea ice surface, it is emitted into the polar atmosphere. We investigate the halogens signal in different sites and with different time coverage; measurements have been carried out in Greenland, Svalbard and Antarctica. We first investigate the conservation of the climate signal in the recent depositions (~3 years coverage) and then we extend the evaluation on a decal, centurial and millennia time scale. The results suggest the connection of Bromine excess with seasonal sea ice extension; Iodine signal shows a different behaviour between the two Poles, hypothetically because of the difference in sea ice physical characteristics, but some questions have to be clarified.",

            "abstract": "Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line (ISTL) in central Japan is one of the most active fault systems in Japan. The Japanese government evaluated a M8 class earthquake may occur at the Gofukuji fault in the central ISTL with a possibility of 14% in the next 30 years. So we analyze GPS data around the northern and the central ISTL to monitor tectonic strain accumulation and to propose a fault model for future earthquake in this area.\nAlong the northern and central ISTL, there exist active faults such as the Kamishiro fault (KF), the East Mathumoto Basin fault (EMBF) and the Gofukuji fault (GF). KF and EMBF are east-dipping reverse faults, and GF is a left-lateral strike slip fault. We analyzed GPS data of 34 campaign sites during 2002-2010 and 55 continuous sites during 1998-2013 to obtain 3-dimentional velocities in the ITRF 2008 reference frame. Around GF, the velocity field represents a typical inter-seismic pattern around a strike slip fault. By applying an elastic dislocation model, we estimate a fault slip rate as 5-7 mm/yr with a locking depth of over 5 km. These parameters are consistent with the seismogenic zone depth and the geological slip rate of GF. On the other hand, for KF and EMBF, we model the deformation pattern with faults in an elastic layer overlying a viscoelastic substratum to represent steady contraction. The modeling result shows KF dips at 30-40 degree and its locking depth is only 2 km, implying that the whole fault is creeping. EMBF dips at 40-50 degree with a locking depth of 2 km. The results indicate that there is ongoing stress accumulation around GF, but KF and EMBF accommodates contraction inelastically. GF at the central ISTL is considered to store strain energy more than 1.000 years and a future major earthquake should occur to release shear stress along the central part. The rupture may continue to the south, but more observation and modeling effect is necessary.",

            "abstract": "The megasplay faults in subduction zones, branching from plate boundary thrusts, are thought to have a potential to generate earthquakes and accompany tsunamis. Paleo-splay faults exposed on land often preserve clear deformation features of the seismogenic zone and provide information on the fault mechanisms at depth. One of the important information that can be obtained from exhumed faults is paleo-stress field. Here we investigated the Nobeoka Thrust, a fossilized megasplay fault in the Shimanto Belt in Kyushu, which consists of phyllite and sandstone-shale mélanges that have experienced maximum burial temperatures of ~250 -320°C, [Kondo et al., 2005, Tectonics 24.6(2005)]. Kondo et al. (2005) described two orientations of slickensides from the outcrop, suggesting the existence of flexural gentle fold in kilometer scale. The paleo-stress fields preserved in the Nobeoka Thrust is likely to represent multiple stages occurring during burial and uplift, enabling the reconstruction of fault motions along the fault. In this study, we analyzed paleo-stress from slip vectors on small faults observed in the drilled cores of the Nobeoka Thrust obtained from scientific drilling performed in 2011. Small faults are expected to be less-reactivated and their population is much larger than that of large faults, providing high statistical reliability. Multiple inverse method [MIM; Yamaji, 2000, Journal of Structural Geology, 22, 441–452] was applied to the small faults. K-means clustering [Otsubo et al. , 2006, Journal of Structural Geology, 28, 991–997] was applied to stress tensors detected by the MIM for estimating optimal solutions. The results reveal stress solution of four directions existing throughout the drilled range. The stress solution is applied to faults distributed among different lithology, and therefore the paleo-stress is thought to have acted on the whole cores. By drawing the stress polygon from the direction of the stress solution and the stress rate, we estimate the stress state of the Nobeoka Thrust and discuss potential insights to the fault stress evolution of megasplay fault in a subduction zone.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost regions in the Northern high latitudes play a key role in the carbon budget of the earth system because of their massive carbon reservoir and the uncertain feedback processes with future climate change. For an improved understanding of mechanisms and drivers dominating permafrost carbon cycling, more observations in high-latitude regions are needed. Particularly the contribution of wintertime fluxes to the annual carbon budget and the impact of disturbances on biogeochemical and biogeophysical ecosystem properties, and the resulting modification of the carbon cycle, have rarely been studied to date.\nIn summer of 2013, we established a new eddy-covariance station for continuous, year-round monitoring of carbon fluxes and their environmental drivers near Cherskii in Northeast Siberia (68.75°N, 161.33°E). Parts of the observation area have been disturbed by drainage since 2004, altering the soil water conditions in a way that is expected for degrading ice-rich permafrost under a warming climate. With two eddy-covariance towers running in parallel over the disturbed (drained) area and a reference area nearby, respectively, we can directly infer the disturbance effect on the carbon cycle budgets and the dominating biogeochemical mechanisms.\nThis study presents findings based on 16 months of continuous eddy-covariance CO2 flux measurements (July 2013 - October 2014) for both observation areas. At both towers, we observed systematic, non-zero flux contributions outside the growing seasons that significantly altered annual CO2 budgets. A direct comparison of fluxes between the two disturbance regimes indicates a net reduction of the sink strength for CO2 in the disturbed area during the growing season, mostly caused by reduced CO2 uptake with low water levels in late summer. Moreover, shifts in soil temperatures and snow cover caused by reduced soil water levels result in lower net CO2 emissions during the winter at the drained area, which is partly compensated by a pronounced emission peak immediately following the spring flood in June. Based on the composition and weighting of environmental factors dominating the fluxes in different seasons, we demonstrate systematic shifts in the carbon cycle mechanisms as a result of 10 years of disturbance in the drained area.",

This geometry forms a transtensional duplex structure. The LOFS has a complex crosscutting relationship with inherited NW-striking structures of the Arc-oblique long-lived Fault System (ALFS). We conducted a structural mapping of fault and vein populations at key structural sites representative of each regional structural system. Field observations were combined with different methods of inversion of fault-slip heterogeneous data and with the use of different open-source computer programs that calculate resolved stress tensors and P-T axes for each structural site in order to unravel the significance of this complex architecture. The results of the inversion of fault-slip analysis show that a transtensional strike-slip regime, with NE-SW-trending subhorizontal σ1, predominate in the first and second order faults in the northern termination of the duplex. A more local tensional regime was calculated for the same area. The inversion solutions are compatible with NE-trending subvertical veins system and dilational jogs and breccia. In contrast, within the central area of the duplex fault slip inversion of fault populations shows both transpressional and compressional regimes. The first tectonic regime is compatible with ENE-striking veins and dikes. In the southern part of the duplex, fault populations are compatible with either a local transtensional stress field with an ESE-trending subhorizontal σ1 or with a tensional regime with a SW-trending, steeply plunging σ1. Our results show the complexity in the nature and spatial distribution of stress fields within strike-slip duplexes and its role in the geometrical distribution of paleo-fluid flow, part of which may account for the reactivation of inherited faults or strain incompatibilities at fault intersections.",

            "abstract": "In recent years important efforts were focused in the development of Climate Field Reconstructions (CFR). These techniques allow merging a limited number of local reconstructions to produce a regular grid which accommodates climatic information from different proxy sources. Pseudo Proxy Experiments (PPE) are idealized experiments performed with synthetic data, typically generated with comprehensive climate models. The PPEs aim at assessing the accuracy that can be expected by (statistical) state-of-the-art reconstruction techniques, but also at identifying potential shortcomings and improvements.\nIn this study a number of PPEs are investigated in order to assess the ability of three different CFR techniques to reconstruct precipitation over Europe. The methods comprise of a linear fit (Canonical Correlation Analysis, CCA), a simple non-linear approach (the Analog Method, AM) and a Bayesian model (Bayesian Hierarchical Method, BHM). Given the inherent complexity of this variable, hardly reproduced by state-of-the-art global circulation models, some downscaling technique is necessary to design meaningful PPEs. In this study the synthetic data consist of a high-resolution climate simulation performed with a Regional Climate Model over Europe for the last two Millennia.\nResults indicate that unlike BHM, CCA systematically underestimates the variance. TheAM can be adjusted to overcome this shortcoming, presenting an intermediate behavior between the two aforementioned techniques. However, a trade-off between reconstruction target correlations and reconstructed variance is the drawback common to all CFR techniques. CCA (BHM) represent the largest (lowest) skill in preserving the temporal evolution, whereas the AM can be tuned to reproduce better correlation at the expense of a loss in variance. While BHM, in the form employed here, has been shown to perform well for temperatures, it does heavily rely on prescribed spatial correlation lengths. For temperature this assumption might be valid, it is hardly warranted for precipitation data. In general, none of the methods outperforms all others. All experiments suggest that a dense and regularly distributed proxy network is required to reconstruct precipitation accurately, reflecting its high spatial and temporal co-variance structure.",

            "abstract": "Lakes are major sources of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere and it has been shown that lakes contribute significantly to the global CH4 budget. However, the data behind these global estimates are snapshots in time and space only and they typically lack information on spatial and temporal variability of fluxes which can potentially lead to biased estimates. Recent studies have shown that diffusive flux, gas exchange velocity (k), ebullition and concentration of CH4 in the surface water can vary significantly in space within lakes. CH4 fluxes can also change at a broad range of temporal scales in response to seasons, temperature, lake mixing events, short term weather events like pressure variations, shifting winds and diel cycles. We sampled CH4 fluxes and surface water concentrations from three lakes of differing characteristics in southwest Sweden over two annual cycles, approximately every 14 days from April to October 2012 and from April to November 2013. CH4 fluxes were measured using floating chambers distributed in the lakes based on depth categories and dissolved CH4 concentrations were determined by a headspace equilibration method. We observed significant differences in CH4 concentration, diffusion, ebullition and total fluxes between and within the lakes. The fluxes increased exponentially with temperature in all three lakes and water temperature, for example, explained 53-78% of variations in total fluxes in the lakes. Based on our data which relied on improved spatial and temporal information, we demonstrate that measurements which do not take into account of the spatial variability in the lakes could substantially bias the whole lake estimates. For instance, in one of the lakes, measurements from the central parts of the lake represented only 58% of our estimates from all chambers on an average. In addition, we consider how intensive sampling in one season of the year may affect the annual estimates due to the complex interaction of temperature, air pressure and lake mixing events on CH4 fluxes. For example, samples collected when the average air temperatures during chamber deployments were above 15 °C overestimated the total fluxes by 17-157% in all lakes when compared to averages from all measurement times.",

            "abstract": "A major challenge for environmental managers is the planning of the restoration of estuarine areas, moreover when several estuaries covering a large region are involved. These restoration plans must be designed by finding a balance between two opposing factors: a complete restoration of the area, i.e. the return to its natural conditions, and the maintenance of its current socioeconomic uses. At the regional level this balance can be obtained by choosing to recover some areas and not others. This work introduces a methodology to help decision-makers in the planning phase of restoration plans by providing an objective tool that measures the level of restoration achievable by different actions.\nThe new approach is based on a classification of the areas to be restored according to some characteristics that represent the possible hydrodynamic and morphodynamic effects that the restoration action may induce on the rest of the estuary. The four parameters chosen to classify the restoration actions are: (1) the change in tidal prism induced by the restoration of the zone, (2) the distance between the area to be restored and the estuary mouth, (3) the tidal wave phase lag and (4) the flood potential of the area to be restored.\nThe classification procedure combines self-organizing maps (SOM) and the K-means algorithm. This combination allows to easily represent multi-dimensional maps in two-dimensional plots while obtaining a concise final classification. The methodology was applied to a total of ten estuaries along the entire coast of Cantabria (Northern Spain), totaling 139 potential restoration areas, where a Spanish Ministry of the Environment Recuperation Plan is underway. The methodology classifies the 139 areas of restoration into five clusters.\nEmpirical relationships were used to estimate the effects the restoration of each cluster may induce on the estuary’s various morphodynamic elements (cross-sectional area of the estuary mouth, area of tidal flats, volume of tidal channels and volume of the ebb tidal delta), giving managers an overall view of the potential effects of the restoration in each zone and providing a basis on which to plan these actions.",

            "abstract": "Quantification of aerosol indirect effects in climate modeling remain unresolved and of large uncertainties. The complicated aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions in climate model are suggested to be quite sensitive to some tunable microphysical parameters such as the threshold radius associated with autoconversion of cloud droplets to rain droplets. More fundamental studies regarding to different microphysical processes used in various cloud microphysical schemes should be devoted, evaluated and investigated.\nIn this study, we apply a synergy of different scale models with the same cloud and aerosol microphysical schemes (Chen and Liu, 2004; Cheng et al., 2007; and Chen et al., 2013) to understand and evaluate how cloud microphysical processes can be influenced by different microphysical schemes and their interaction with aerosols and radiation. These models include Kinematic Driver (KiD), Single Column Model of Community Atmosphere Model (SCAM), Large Eddy Simulation (LES), and NCAR CESM model. Simulation results from these models will be further validated and compared to either field campaign or satellite observations depending on the scale of the models. Off-line satellite simulator approach (i.e. Joint-Simulator) will also be applied for evaluating cloud microphysics against CloudSat and CALIPSO. Such type of synergy of models can be very useful for improvement, development and evaluation of physical parameterizations for global climate prediction and weather forecast in the near future especially for processes related to cloud macrophysics and microphysics.",

In this phase, the numerical modelling approach emerges as a useful tool in order to simulate the scenarios and addresses the issue of oil dispersion in the case of a spill. The 3D operational hydrodynamic modelling system of the Ligurian Sea (North-Western Mediterranean) is used as a base to predict the possible oil trajectory and to track the path and fate of spilled oil under the prevailing hydrodynamic and meteorological conditions. The operative chain of the hydrodynamic model was developed by DHI Italia for the Regional Environment Protection Agency (ARPAL) operating in the Ligurian region (Italy) with the objective to preserve the environment, support the activities of the Civil Protection Department and promote a sustainable, healthy and safety management of the local resources. In this chain the MFS Mediterranean 3D model (operated within MyOcean EU Project – Copernicus Programme) was downscaled from 6.5 km to finer nearshore mesh (500 m). The increased spatial resolution allows the correct simulation of current developments in the vicinity of morphological discontinuities such as the promontory of Portofino on the Ligurian coast. The meteorological forcing is provided by MOLOCH, a LAM model operated by ARPAL together with fresh water discharges from the main rivers through hydrological modelling. Since the Ligurian Sea recently hosted the transfer of wreck Costa Concordia some real time simulations of hypothetical oil spill were performed to support the crisis unit of the Genoa Coast Guard. Simulations led to interesting results concerning the importance of updated weather conditions, which strongly influence current trends, focusing on the importance of the continuity of the modelling chain.",

            "abstract": "Although numerous warming experiments have been done to examine the impacts of elevated temperature on soil microbial actives, most of them were based on responses from a single site. To investigate how precipitation regime regulate warming’s effects on carbon cycle, field manipulative warming experiments were conducted at 3 types of steppes (desert, typical and meadow steppe) along a precipitation gradient in northern China. Soil temperature, moisture, dissolved organic C (DOC), inorganic nitrogen (N) concentration, microbial biomass C (MBC), N (MBN) and respiration (MR) were measured once a year from 2006 to 2009. The results showed that soil moisture was significantly decreased in the typical steppe whereas not affected in the desert and meadow steppe, respectively. Across the 4 years, warming decreased MBC and MR in the desert and typical steppe while did not affect them in the meadow steppe. The magnitude of reductions in warming-induced MBC and MR declined with increasing precipitation gradient at a regional scale. Across the precipitation gradient, all changes in soil MBC, MBN and MR were positively correlated with both annual precipitation and changes in belowground net primary productivity (BNPP), suggesting that soil microbial responses to warming may be regulated by annual precipitation and substrate availability. However, the lab-incubation revealed that soil moisture is more important in regulating soil microbial activities than substrate across the 3 steppes. In addition, soil microbial responses to warming showed year-to-year variations during the first 4 years coincided with the fluctuations in annual precipitation across the 3 steppes. Our results suggested that precipitation regime controls the spatial and interannual responses of soil microbes to warming, mainly by regulating soil moisture and substrate availability. With the increase in precipitation, the positive responses of soil microbes to warming started to outweigh the negative impacts caused by the decline of soil moisture.",

            "abstract": "The Chinese Altai is a key region to decipher the accretionary history of the gigantic CAOB, one of the largest accretionary orogenic belts on the earth. However, its Paleozoic tectonothermal events and tectonic implications remain debated. In this study, a suite of igneous rocks, including high Mg dacite of the Kangbutiebao Formation and the associated gneissic granite, have been studied for their petrogenesis and tectonic implication. The high Mg dacite is dated at 400±2Ma, which broadly resembles the emplacement age of the high Mg gneissic granite of 406±9Ma, possibly suggesting that they were generated in a common tectono-magmatic event. Both rocks have zircon inheritances of ~500 Ma, which is consistent with the age of predominant zircon population for in the widespread Habahe sequence, indicating that their precursor magmas were probably mainly derived from the Habahe sediments. The high-Mg rock association has similar REE and trace element patterns to those of the Habahe sediments and they plot close to the field of the Habahe sediments in Th/Ta versus La/Ta diagram. They have high A/CNK ratios (1.33-2.05), supporting their source was sedimentary rocks. In Ba/Th versus (La/Sm)N diagram, these rocks are characterized by high La/Sm ratios which suggests a greater contribution of sediments rather than altered oceanic crust in the magma generation. However, the high Mg# values (~51) of the studied rocks argue against derivation purely from remelting of Habahe sediments. In order to explain the high Mg# values (~51) of these rocks, the participation of mantle-derived melt into the precursor magma is considered. Zircons from this rock association mostly have εHf(t) values from +0.85 to +9.71, supporting the involvement of juvenile materials in the magma generation. Samples from the high Mg rock association fall in the same field as the sanukitoids in TiO2 versus Mg# and Sr/Y versus Y diagrams, plot in the fractional crystallization trend of differentiated sanukitoids in Harker diagram. Similar to the sanukitoids in the Setouchi area, our high Mg rock association also involved melting of subducted sediments in a hot subduction regime. Combined with previous work, a ridge subduction regime is used to interpret the early Devonian tectonic evolution of the Chinese Altai.",

            "abstract": "Conceptual models for problem framing in environmental (EIA) and health impact assessment (HIA) share similar concepts, but differ in their scientific or policy focus, methodologies and underlying causal chains, and the degree of complexity and scope. The Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework used by the European Environment Agency, the OECD and others and the Integrated Science for Society and the Environment (ISSE) frameworks are widely applied in policy appraisal and impact assessments. While DPSIR is applied across different policy domains, the ISSE framework is used in Ecosystem Services assessments. The modified Driver-Pressure-State-Exposure-Effect-Action (DPSEEA) model extends DPSIR by separating exposure from effect, adding context as a modifier of effect, and susceptibility to exposures due to socio-economic, demographic or other determinants. While continuously evolving, the application of conceptual frameworks in policy appraisals mainly occurs within established discipline boundaries. However, drivers and environmental states, as well as policy measures and actions, affect both human and ecosystem receptors. Furthermore, unintended consequences of policy actions are seldom constrained within discipline or policy silos. Thus, an integrated conceptual model is needed, accounting for the full causal chain affecting human and ecosystem health in any assessment. We propose a novel model integrating HIA methods and ecosystem services in an attempt to operationalise the emerging concept of “Ecological Public Health.” The conceptual approach of the ecosystem-enriched DPSEEA model (“eDPSEEA”) has stimulated wide-spread debates and feedback. We will present eDPSEEA as a stakeholder engagement process and a conceptual model, using illustrative case studies of climate change as a starting point, not a complete solution, for the integration of human and ecosystem health impact assessment as a key challenge in a rapidly changing world.\nRayner G and Lang T Ecological Public Health: Reshaping the Conditions for Good Health.

            "abstract": "Various studies suggested that changes in morphology and the demise of calcareous nannoplankton around Cretaceous Oceanic Anoxic Event (OAE) 1a were the result of large-scale (surface) ocean acidification caused by a substantial input of CO2. However, the link between extinction, changes in morphology, calcification crisis and surface ocean acidification is heavily debated. Crucially the relative timing, magnitude and duration of CO2 input during OAE 1a and hence potential to change surface ocean pH and calcite saturation state (Ω) are unconstraint. Here we provide the first high-resolution record of atmospheric CO2 across OAE 1a that depicts the often-inferred increase and decrease in pCO2. Crucially, we show that the initial increase in pCO2 was a gradual and sustained process that lasted at least 100 kyr. Earth system modeling indicates that over such timescales buffering of ocean chemistry by dissolution of deep-sea carbonates and weathering on land prevent surface ocean acidification. Widespread surface ocean acidification could therefore not have occurred during OAE 1a. Our results challenge recent suggestion of widespread ocean acidification across OAE 1a and highlight that the currently observed and further predicted anthropogenic decrease in surface ocean pH and Ω is extremely rare if not unique within the geological record.",

Changes in the concentration and hydrogen isotope ratio of lipids produced by the green alga Botryococcus braunii, which blooms during El Niño rains in the Galápagos Islands, indicate that the early Holocene (9200-5600 yr BP) was characterized by alternating extremes in the intensity and/or frequency of El Niño events that lasted a century or more. Our data from the core of the ENSO region thus calls into question earlier studies that reported a lack of El Niño activity in the early Holocene. In agreement with other proxy evidence from the tropical Pacific, the mid-Holocene (5600-3500 yr BP) was a time of consistently weak El Niño activity, as were the Early Middle Ages (~1000-1500 yr BP). El Niño activity was moderate to high during the remainder of the last 3500 years. Periods of strong or frequent El Niño tended to occur during peaks in solar activity and during extended droughts in the United States Great Plains linked to La Niña. These changing modes of ENSO activity at millennial and multi-centennial timescales may have been caused by variations in the seasonal receipts of solar radiation associated with the precession of the equinoxes and/or changes in solar activity, respectively.",

Very suitable for this purpose is the closely spaced Swarm satellite formation, which existed shortly after launch during the commissioning phase. As dataset we use the standard Level 2 product, Single Satellite FAC, which comes at a data rate of 1 Hz, corresponding to an along-track distance of 7.5 km.\nFACs are known to cover a wide range of scales from 1km to several hundred kilometres, the smaller the scale the larger the amplitude. We like to divide the FACs into two classes. Those of intermediate scale, some tens of kilometres, which are carried predominantly by kinetic Alfvén waves, while the large-scale FACs are assumed to be stationary current structures on the timescales of a satellite crossing. For distinguishing between the two we first look how the temporal variability changes with scale. For that we consider subsequent measurements at the same point, the orbital cross-over near the geographic poles, and interpret the temporal current changes. Here we focus on observations in the southern hemisphere at locations where the geographic pole lies within the auroral region.\nIn a next step the latitudinal and longitudinal scales of the larger-scale FAC structures are investigated. FACs related to Alfvén waves cannot be studied in this way because we have no simultaneous measurements at the same latitude and longitude. The results from this analysis are different for dayside and nightside. Implications for the FAC characteristics resulting from these observations are interpreted in the end.",

The Thuringian basin is composed of sedimentary rocks from the latest Paleozoic and mainly Triassic and particularly suited to undertake such research as it is of relative small size, about 50 times 100 km, easily accessible, and quite well known from previous studies. INFLUINS consists on several projects tightly connected to each other and coming from various disciplines of geosciences including among others geophysics, hydrogeology, sedimentology, mineralogy, and remote sensing. A deep drilling campaign, which took place close to Erfurt in the center of the basin in summer 2013, is one of the main achievements of INFLUINS.\nIn preparation for deep drilling, in 2011, we conducted an extensive seismic reflection site survey, in the framework of which the center of the basin down to the top basement was imaged in high quality. Drilling went down to a depth of 1179 m, drilling Triassic rocks from Keuper to lower Buntsandstein and led to more than 500 m of cores of excellent quality and more than 600 cuttings samples. Down-hole geophysical logging over the entire depth of the drill hole is complemented with Multi Sensor Core Logging leading to an extensive geophysical data set with a spatial resolution up to the cm-scale.\nHere, we present overall results of the drilling campaign and focus on the boundaries between major groups as well as between prominent beds including e.g. rock salt and other pronounced aquitards.",

            "abstract": "Large tsunamis since the last about one hundred years along the Sanriku Coast on the Pacific Coast of northeast Japan were well documented and observed. Additionally, many historical records described about tsunamis during recent several hundreds years. However, we cannot expect the latest large tsunami generated by the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake because previous studies of paleo-tsunami deposits were not efficient and geological evidences of paleo-tsunamis were not obtained on the coast. Thus, we conducted excavating surveys on coastal marshes to identify paleo-tsunami deposits and correlate to historical tsunami events. In laboratory, we revealed physico-chemical sediment property and performed radiocarbon dating and tephra analysis for establishing their geochronology. As a result, we referred to eleven tsunami deposits including 2011 tsunami deposits since ca. 3000-4000 Cal BP and correlated them with historical tsunamis (1896 Meiji Sanriku tsunami, 1611 Keicho Sanriku tsunami, 869 Jogan tsunami) in Koyadori. In Onuma, we identified six tsunami deposits since ca. 5000 Cal BP and younger two deposits of them are possibly corresponding to historical tsunamis. This is the first report of identifying onshore paleo-tsunami deposits correlating to historical tsunamis on the Sanriku Coast based on sediment property, many radiocarbon dating, and tephra correlation.\nAs these results were derived from only two sites, we need many solid data in other sites to confirm our correlations. In the future, these data are linked to researches for establishing the earthquake cycle model along the Japan Trench and evaluating the magnitude of paleo-tsunamis and paleo-earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Hydrologic disturbances are commonly associated with the phenomenal occurrence of extreme events. The human kind has always been facing problem with hydrologic extremes in terms of deaths and economic loss. Hence, a complete analysis of observed extreme events will have a substantial role in planning, designing and management of the water resource systems. Over the United States, precipitation extremes, temperature and streamflow, have increased during the twentieth century and has been attributed to many natural and anthropogenic influences. The present study examines the association of precipitation extremes on temperature over US for the period of 1950-2000. The annual maxima (AM) precipitation has been extracted for hot and cold years. The spatial mean of surface temperature/ sea surface temperature from 1950 to 2000, so obtained is arranged in ascending order. The corresponding years, with lowest temperature of 25 years are defined as cold years and highest temperature of 25 years are defined as hot years respectively. The spatio-temporal variability of 50 year return level (RL) for the AM is determined considering generalized extreme value (GEV) and non-parametric kernel distributions. To identify the significant changes in the derived RL from cold to hot years, a bootstrap-based approach is implemented. The results exhibited no significant changes in the 50 year RL of AM precipitation between hot and cold years, with 70% of total grids showing no significant changes with respect to both land surface and sea surface temperature at 20% significance level. The scatter plot between the spatial mean of AM precipitation and both land surface and sea surface temperature over US showed no association. Further the comparison with the CMIP5 models revealed that the models are showed significant association between both land surface and sea surface temperature with the AM of precipitation. The major decision making and planning rely on the model predictions, which shows increased global warming with increase in precipitation extremes, however the observed data shows no such significant relation. Hence, the results imply the requirements of serious research on the association between intensification of precipitation extremes and temperature increase.",

            "abstract": "In this study a micro-mechanical model is developed to study the fracture propagation process in rocks. The model is represented by an array of bonded particles simulated by the Discrete Sphero-Polyhedral Element Model (DSEM), which was introduced by the authors previously and has been shown to be a suitable technique to model rock [1]. It allows the modelling of particles of general shape, with no internal porosity. The motivation behind using this technique is the desire to microscopically investigate the fracture propagation process and study the relationship between the microscopic and macroscopic behaviour of rock.\nThe DSEM method is used to model the Crack Chevron Notch Brazilian Disc (CCNBD) test suggested by the International Society of Rock Mechanics (ISRM) for determining the fracture toughness of rock specimens. CCNBD samples with different crack inclination angles, are modelled to investigate their fracture mode. The Crack Mouth Opening Displacement (CMOD) is simulated and the results are validated using experimental results obtained from a previous study [2]. Fig. 1 shows the simulated and experimental results of crack propagation for different inclination angles of CCNBD specimens. The DSEM method can be used to predict crack trajectory and quantify crack propagation during loading.\n",

            "abstract": "During the last postglacial evolution of the shallow northern Siberian shelf systems regional sea level in the Arctic came to its Holocene highstand some time between 5 to 6 ka. After that time a general stabilization of the sedimentary regime occurred. That is well noted in a drastic decrease in sedimentation rates observed in all sediment cores taken from middle to outer shelf water depths of the Laptev Sea. But, at water depths lower than 30 meters – i.e., in the inner shelf and nearer to the coasts – sedimentation continued at relatively higher rates, presumably due to input of terrigenous material from river runoff as well as coastal erosion. Compared with that latter process, the huge Lena Delta should comprise a region of sediment catchment where aggradation wins over erosion. However, little is known about the detailed history of this delta during the second half of the Holocene. In order to gain more insight into this issue we have investigated three islands within the Lena Delta. All of these are comprised of massive peat of several meters in thickness. Picking discrete specimens of water mosses (Sphagnum) only, we have radiocarbon-dated these peat sections. The depth/age relation of the sampled profiles reflect the growth rate of peat. It shows that the islands’ history above the present-day delta-sea level is about 4000 yrs. old. Moreover, a significant change in peat growth occurred after 2500 yrs BP in both, accumulation and composition, and allows the conclusion of a major shift in Arctic environmental conditions since then. Thus, our results may add further information also for other coastal studies, as the ongoing degradation of the rather vulnerable permafrost coast in the Laptev Sea and elsewhere along the North Siberian margin is often mentioned in context with recent Arctic climate change due to global warming.",

            "abstract": "The position of the Arctic treeline is of critical importance for global carbon cycling and surface energy budgets. However, controls on tree growth at treeline remain uncertain. In the Alaskan Brooks Range, 20th century warming has caused varying growth responses among treeline trees, with trees in the west responding positively, while trees in the east have responded negatively. The prevailing explanation of this trend ascribes the negative growth response to warming-induced drought stress in the eastern Brooks Range. However, recent measurements of carbon isotope discrimination in tree rings, xylem sap flow and needle gas exchange suggest that drought stress cannot explain these regional growth declines. Additionally, evidence from the western Brooks Range suggests that nutrient availability, rather than drought stress, may be the proximate control on tree growth. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that low and declining growth of eastern Brooks Range trees is due to low and declining soil nutrient availability, which may continue to decrease with climate change as soils become drier and microbial activity declines. We compared microclimate, tree performance, and a wide range of proxies for soil nutrient availability in four watersheds along a west-east transect in the Brooks Range during the growing seasons of 2013 and 2014. We hypothesized that soil nutrient availability would track closely with the strong west-east precipitation gradient, with higher rainfall and greater soil nutrient availability in the western Brooks Range. We expected to find that soil water contents in the west are near optimum for nitrogen mineralization, while those in the east are below optimum. Needle nitrogen concentration, net photosynthesis, branch extension growth, and growth in the main stem are expected to decline with the hypothesized decrease in soil nutrient availability. The results of our study will elucidate the current controls on growth of trees near the Arctic treeline, enabling improved predictions of future treeline position and more accurate reconstructions of past climate.",

            "abstract": "River delta shorelines may be characterized by complex patterns of sediment transport and sequestering at various timescales in response to changes in sediment supply, hydrodynamic conditions, and deltaic self-organization. While being good indicators of delta stability, these changes also have important coastal management and defence implications. These aspects are examined with reference to the mouths of the Mekong River delta, the world’s third largest delta, backbone of the Vietnamese economy and home to nearly 20 million people. We conducted an analysis of shoreline fluctuations over the last five decades using low-resolution Landsat (1973-2014), very high-resolution SPOT 5 (2003-2011) satellite imagery, topographic maps (1950, 1965), and field hydrodynamic and shoreline topographic measurements. The results show that the 250 km-long river-mouth sector of the delta shoreline has been characterized by overall accretion but with marked temporal and spatial variations. The temporal pattern is attributed to fluctuations in sediment supply due to both human activities and natural variations in catchment sediment loads (e.g., 2000-2003), and natural adjustments in delta-plain sediment storage and delivery to the coast. The spatial pattern is indicative of discrete sediment cells that may be a response to an overall decreasing sand supply, especially since 2003, following increasingly massive riverbed mining with concomitant losses in channel-bed sand. Field measurements show the prevalence of mesotidal bar-trough beaches characterized by sand migration to the southwest in response to energetic dry-season monsoon waves. Beaches underfed as a result of both wave-energy gradients and possible diminishing sand supply from the adjacent river mouths are eroded to feed accreting beaches. Understanding this cell pattern has important implications in terms of: (1) interpreting past patterns of shoreline translation involved in the construction of successive beach ridges that characterise the prograding mouths sector of the Mekong; (2) linking shoreline stability/instability with coastal sand supply by the Mekong River and the impacts of human activities on this supply; (3) shoreline management and defence planning in the critical sandy river-mouth sector of this densely populated delta.",

The model dynamics preserve a number of important properties of differential operators and conserve a variety of first order and quadratic quantities. The nonlinear dynamics is controlled by conserving energy and enstrophy in case of non-divergent flow. Over-specification of non-hydrostatic vertical velocity is avoided. The physical package was developed from the WRF NMM’s physics, but other physics options are also available.\nThe regional version of the NMMB is run operationally as the main deterministic North American short-range forecasting model (NAM) and in a number of other applications. The global NMMB also has been run over the last few years experimentally in order to assess its capabilities and develop it further. In terms of large scale metrics, the performance of the global NMMB in medium range weather forecasting has been generally comparable to that of other major medium range forecasting systems. Its computational efficiency satisfies and exceeds the current and projected operational requirements. Recently, the transition has started of the operational hurricane forecasting system HWRF from the WRF NMM dynamics to those of the NMMB. This system involves the use of a hierarchy of 2-way interactive telescoping moving nests.\nThe work on developing a unified multi-scale physics package has continued. Extended range forecasts showed large sensitivity to the method for representing clouds. With the clouds represented by optical properties of their microphysics species, the results depend on the microphysics scheme used. Also, taking into account the impact of convective clouds remains a challenge with this approach. Numerous sensitivity studies of physical parameterizations and the dynamical core features have been carried out as well. Relevant results will be presented and discussed, including some results of recent idealized dynamics tests.",

            "abstract": "The mobility of alloying elements in liquid iron has important kinetic implications for timescales and processes occurring in metallic cores and core-mantle boundaries of differentiated bodies. According to current models of the Earth’s core-mantle segregation, substantial amounts of light elements (Si and/or O), as well as Cr, should have partitioned from a magma ocean into metallic Fe-Ni cores of planetesimals during accretion. In contrast to these predictions, however, the Si, O, and Cr contents of iron meteorites, which are derived from the metallic cores of early-formed planetesimals, are surprisingly low (e.g. < 1 ppm). The partitioning of Si, O, and Cr into liquid iron has been shown experimentally to increase with temperature so that that the alloy component of a planetesimal core should decrease during cooling. Ongoing metal-silicate interaction at the CMB of larger bodies, such as the Earth, and potential diffusive profiles of light elements in the outmost region of the Earth’s outer core have been used to model and interpret deviations from reference model seismic wave speeds in these respective regions. We are conducting a series of high P-T experiments and first principles calculations to constrain the diffusivity of Si, O, and Cr in liquid iron in order to understand the kinetics of chemical transport and equilibration during core formation and processes occurring at CMBs.\nExperimental diffusion couples comprised of highly polished cylindrical disks of 99.97% Fe and metallic Fe alloy (Fe6Si, Fe12Si, Fe9O, Fe92Cr, Fe85Si14Cr) were contained in an MgO capsule and annealed within the P-T range 1642–2573 K and 3–18 GPa in a multi-anvil apparatus. A series of experiments are conducted at each pressure using variable heating rates, final temperatures (Tf), and time duration at Tf. To extend our dataset to P-T conditions of the Earth’s core-mantle boundary, we have begun first principles molecular dynamics (FP-MD) calculations. Fe supercells are overheated to induce melting, compressed along several isotherms (2000–5000K) and allowed for changes in chemistry (Si, O, Cr) and alloy concentration. Diffusion coefficients are computed from the atomic trajectories in the simulation cell via the Einstein relation.",

            "abstract": "In the last few years, pore scale studies have become the key to understanding the complex fluid flow processes in the fields of groundwater remediation, hydrocarbon recovery and environmental issues related to carbon storage and capture. A pore scale study is often comprised of two key procedures: 3D pore scale imaging and numerical modelling techniques. The essence of a pore scale study is to test the physics implemented in a model of complicated fluid flow processes at one scale (microscopic) and then apply the model to solve the problems associated with water resources and oil recovery at other scales (macroscopic and field). However, the process of up-scaling from the pore scale to the macroscopic scale has encountered many challenges due to both pore scale imaging and modelling techniques. Due to the technical limitations in the imaging method, there is always a compromise between the spatial (voxel) resolution and the physical volume of the sample (field of view, FOV) to be scanned by the imaging methods, specifically X-ray micro-CT (XMT) in our case\nIn this study, a careful analysis was done to understand the effect of voxel size, using XMT to image the 3D pore space of a variety of porous media from sandstones to carbonates scanned at different voxel resolution (4.5 μm, 6.2 μm, 8.3 μm and 10.2 μm) but keeping the scanned FOV constant for all the samples. We systematically segment the micro-CT images into three phases, the macro-pore phase, an intermediate phase (unresolved micro-pores + grains) and the grain phase and then study the effect of voxel size on the structure of the macro-pore and the intermediate phases and the fluid flow properties using lattice-Boltzmann (LB) and pore network (PN) modelling methods. We have also applied a numerical coarsening algorithm (up-scale method) to reduce the computational power and time required to accurately predict the flow properties using the LB and PN method.",

            "abstract": "Two statistical methods to link flow regimes to fish species richness (FSR) on a global scale will be introduced: a conventional one based on a linear relationship between FSR and mean river discharge and the other one, a newly proposed one, based on a multi-linear relationship between FSR and several ecologically relevant flow indices. These two methods were connected with a set of global hydrological simulations so that the differences in model outputs due to the potential impact of climate-change-induced flow alterations were calculated. The new method showed very different responses from the conventional one. Differences are apparent in arid regions and in snow regions. Although it is not the purpose of this study to show which prediction is better, it can be said that taking plural ecologically relevant flow indices into account in global modeling would lead to different results in terms of estimating changes in fish species richness.",

            "abstract": "With about 12 millions of inhabitants, Paris is the third megacity of Europe. Due to anthropogenic activities based on fossil fuel consumption (mainly gas heating and traffic) and cement production, inventories relate that Paris region emits about 55 millions of tons of CO2. These estimates come from inventories that are based on benchmarked emission factors and activity proxies. They are not verified independently, highlighting the need for developing new tools of monitoring-reporting-verifying Paris CO2 emissions. Since emissions are diluted into the atmosphere, atmospheric measurements and inverse transport modeling constitute tools of choice to develop such new methods, that one would ideally design to be useful for a large number of urbanized areas. Especially, when fossil fuels are burned, the combustion process leads to the atmospheric emission of not only CO2 but also CO and several other species that are specific of each combustible. Furthermore, the ratio of each species to CO2 is characteristic of the emission source, allowing the possible identification of the relative role of the different emission sectors on the total plume of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere. In the framework of several projects (CO2-Megaparis, Multi-CO2, Primequal-Zapa), one year of CO2 and CO in-situ measurements were monitored in Paris region. For a few weeks several other species were collected such as NOx, carbon isotopes (d12C, d13C, D14C) and volatile organic compounds. In this work, we will present the analysis of CO/CO2 ratios over a year but also an overwiew of the main results obtained through the analysis of correlations between CO2, NOx, VOCs and carbon isotopes collected during intensive campaigns in Paris.",

            "abstract": "Valles Marineris is the most significant near-linear depression on Mars. It is some 4000 km long, up to about 200 km wide and some 7 km deep. Although its margins look parallel at first sight, the entire structure has a long spindle shape with significant enlargement in its middle (Melas Chasma) caused by cuspate slope retreat mechanisms. Farther to its north is Hebes Chasma which is an entirely closed depression with a more pronounced spindle shape. Tithonium Chasma is a parallel, but much narrower depression to its northeast. All these chasmae have axes parallel with one another and such structures occur nowhere else on Mars. A scabland surface exists to the east of the Valles Marineris and the causative water mass seems to have issued from it.\nThe great resemblance of these chasmae on mars to poljes in the karstic regions on earth have led us to assume that they owed their existence to dissolution of rock layers underlying them. We assumed that the dissolving layer consisted of water ice forming substantial layers, in fact entirely frozen seas of several km depth. We have simulated this geometry by using bentonite and flour layers (in different experiments) overlying layers of ice in which a resistant coil was used to simulate a dyke. We used different thicknesses of bentonite and flour overlying ice layers again of various thicknesses. The flour seems to simulate the Martian crust better because on Mars, g is only about 3/8ths of its value on Earth, so (for equal crustal density) the depth to which the cohesion term C remains important in the Mohr-Coulomb shear failure criterion is about 8/3 times greater. As examples we show two of those experiments in which both the rock analogue and ice layers were of 1.5 cm. thick. Perfect analogues of the Valles Marineris formed above the dyke analogue thermal source complete with the near-linear structure, overall flat spindle shape, cuspate margins, a central ridge, parallel side faults, parallel depressions resembling the Tithonium Chasma. When water was allowed to drain from the beginning, closed depressions formed that have an amazing resemblance to Hebes chasma. We postulate that the entire system of chasmae here discussed formed atop a major dyke swarm some 4000 km length, not dissimilar to the 3500 km long Mesoproterozoic (Ectasian) dyke swarm disrupting the Canadian Shield.",

Degradation is attributed to an increase in mean annual ground temperature 0.1◦-0.5◦ C with mainly winter warming. The construction of Qinghai-Tibet Railway also influenced a state of permafrost in the area Permafrost degradation caused negative environmental consequences in the area. The areas covered by sand are expanding steadily making large concern of accelerating desertification. The general pathway of future joint dynamics of permafrost, vegetation and hydrological status at the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is still poorly understood and foreseeable. Hydrology in the area is determined by heat-moisture dynamics of active layer. This dynamics is highly non-linear and depends as on external climatic variables temperature and precipitation, so on soil and rock properties (amount of sand against aeolian deposits in the Plateau) as well as vegetation cover, which determine thaw and freeze processes in the active layer and evaporation and run-off.\nSEVER DGVM was modified to include heat-moisture dynamics of active layer in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. SEVER DGVM imitates processes in 10 plant functional types at coarse resolution of 0.5 degrees. This model imitates behavior of average individual of each plant type in each grid cell through simulation years. Each of those grid cells processed independently. First, this model starts from “bare soil”, placing a bit of each plant type and giving them some time to grow and achieve equilibrium. Then, including active layer thickness and soil moisture dynamics into this layer, it allows assessment of potential environmental dynamics in this area. Simulations demonstrate further degradation of pastureland and accelerating desertification processes in this vitally important water feed area for many Asian rivers. Negative environmental problems related to operation of Qinghai-Tibet are also assessed.",

Analysis of the losses due to past disasters indicates those most catastrophic in the region have historically been due to strong earthquakes. Estimation of expected ground motion is a fundamental earthquake hazard assessment. The most commonly used parameter for attenuation relation is peak ground acceleration because this parameter gives useful information for Seismic Hazard Assessment. Thus, many peak ground acceleration attenuation relations have been developed by different authors. However, a few attenuation relations were developed for Caucasus region: Ambraseys et al. (1996,2005) which were based on entire European region and they were not focused locally on Caucasus Region, Smit et.al.(2000) that was based on a small amount of acceleration data that really is not enough.\nSince 2003 construction of Georgian Digital Seismic Network has started with the help of number of International organizations, Projects and Private companies. In this study new GMP models are obtained based on new data from Georgian seismic network and also from neighboring countries. Estimation of models is obtained by classical, statistical way, regression analysis. Also site ground conditions are considered because the same earthquake recorded at the same distance may cause different damage according to ground conditions. Thus, this parameter is emphasized in the present study. Here it must be mentioned that in previous model which only one was done for Caucasus Region (Smit et. al., 2000) local conditions were not considered. Thus, it is an advantage of models from this study.",

            "abstract": "Due to the tectonic environment and tropical climate in the Philippines, both rain-induced and seismic-induced landslides are common in the country. Numerous hazard mapping activities are regularly conducted by both academic and government institutions using various tools and software. One such software is Stability Index Mapping (SINMAP), a terrain stability mapping tool applied to shallow translational landslide phenomena controlled by shallow groundwater flow convergence. SINMAP modelling combines a slope stability model with a steady-state hydrology model to delineate areas prone to shallow landslides. DOST- Project NOAH, one of the hazard-mapping initiatives of the government, aims to map all landslide hazard in the Philippines using both computer models as well as validating ground data. Laguna, located in the island of Luzon, is one such area where mapping and modelling is conducted. SINMAP modelling of the Laguna area was run with a 5-meter Interferomteric Synthetic Aperture Radar (IFSAR) derived digital terrain model (DTM). Topographic, soil-strength and physical hydrologic parameters, which include cohesion, angle of friction, bulk density and hydraulic conductivity, were assigned to each pixel of a given DTM grid to compute for the corresponding factor of safety. The landslide hazard map generated using SINMAP shows 2% of the total land area is highly susceptible in Santa Mara, Famy, Siniloan, Pangil, Pakil and Los Baἦos Laguna and 10% is moderately susceptible in the eastern parts of Laguna. The data derived from the model is consistent with both ground validation surveys as well as landslide inventories derived from high resolution satellite imagery from 2003 to 2013. With these combined computer and on-the-ground data, it is useful in identifying no-build zone areas and in monitoring activities of the local government units and other agencies concerned. This provides a reasonable delineation of hazard zones for shallow landslide susceptible areas of Laguna Philippines.",

The platform runs on a variety of HPC clusters, and waveforms are calculated using SPECFEM3D. We use the full waveform modelling techniques supported on the VERCE platform to test the validity of a number of subduction zone velocity models from the Chilean subduction zone. Waveforms are calculated for aftershocks of the 2010 Mw 8.8 Maule (central Chile) and the Mw 8.1 2014 Pisagua (Northern Chile) earthquakes. For the Maule region, we use a 2D tomographic model of the rupture area (Hicks et al., 2012), and the focal mechanisms of Agurto et al., (2012). For the Pisagua earthquake, we use a 2.5D composite velocity model based on tomographic studies of the region (e.g. Husen et al., 2000, Contreras-Reyes et al., 2012) and Slab1.0 (Hayes et al., 2012). Focal mechanisms for the Pisagua aftershock sequence are produced from waveforms recorded on the IPOC network using the program ISOLA (Sokos and Zahradnik, 2008). We also test a number of synthetic velocity models.\nThe simulated waveforms are directly compared to waveforms recorded on the temporary deployment for the Maule earthquake aftershocks, and waveforms recorded on the IPOC network for the Pisagua earthquake aftershocks. The waveforms produced by the 3D full waveform simulations are also compared to the waveforms produced by the focal mechanism inversion, which assume a 1D velocity model. The VERCE platform allows waveforms from the full 3D model to be produced easily, and allows us to quantifiably assess the validity of both the velocity model and the source mechanisms. In particular the dependence of the dip of the focal mechanism on the velocity model used is explored, in order to assess the reliability of current models of the plate interface geometry in the Chilean subduction zone.",

Droughts are linked to the water cycle and, although a climate change signal may not have emerged yet, they are also intimately linked to climate.\nIn this work we develop an auto-regressive logistic model for drought prediction at different temporal scales that makes use of a spatially explicit framework. Our model allows to include covariates, continuous or categorical, to improve the performance of the auto-regressive component.\nOur approach makes use of dimensionality reduction (principal component analysis) and classification techniques (K-Means and maximum dissimilarity) to simplify the representation of complex climatic patterns, such as sea surface temperature (SST) and sea level pressure (SLP), while including information on their spatial structure, i.e. considering their spatial patterns. This procedure allows us to include in the analysis multivariate representation of complex climatic phenomena, as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. We also explore the impact of other climate-related variables such as sun spots.\nThe model allows to quantify the uncertainty of the forecasts and can be easily adapted to make predictions under future climatic scenarios. The framework herein presented may be extended to other applications such as flash flood analysis, or risk assessment of natural hazards.",

            "abstract": "Plate tectonics on Earth requires strong lithospheric plates, weak underlying convecting asthenospheric mantle and weak zones in the lithosphere where rifting occurs. For several decades, hydrogen has been considered to be an important control on the strength of mantle minerals. However, recent experimental work has questioned this relationship and in addition, xenolith and magnetotelluric data from several cratonic regions have shown them to be surprisingly rich in hydrogen. In order to test the impact of hydrogen content on rheology, magnetotelluric data were collected over the East Africa Rift and the adjacent un-rifted Tanzanian Craton. The East Africa Rift is the best exposed continental rift on Earth and its contrasting behaviour with the stable Tanzanian Craton makes it an ideal location to test models of mantle rheology. The conductivity of mantle minerals is strongly controlled by their hydrogen contents so magnetotellurics is the ideal tool to measure mantle hydrogen contents in-situ. Results show that the Tanzanian Craton is extremely rich in hydrogen while the East Africa Rift is anhydrous both in magmatically rich and poor regions. Therefore, hydrogen is not an important control on plate strength in East Africa. The main contrast between the craton and the regions undergoing rifting is grain size, which was reduced in the rifted regions during Proterozoic deformation. Therefore, the localization of rifting appears to be controlled by grain-size. These results show that continued reactivation of deformed regions on Earth is likely not due to high hydrogen contents but to small grain size. The results should encourage further experimental work to reconcile the relationship between hydrogen content, grain-size and rheology.",

            "abstract": "In many geological reservoirs, open fractures or fault zones generally induce high spatial variability of hydrodynamical properties and shape the main deep-seated flow paths. It is of crucial interest to determine their structure and properties in order to achieve a sound and sustained exploitation of resources or to estimate the risk of failure of any underground storage. Tiltmeters have emerged as new tools to observe deformation generated by groundwater flow. As such instruments are highly sensitive to pressure gradients, they are perfectly suited for monitoring channelized flow in connected fractures and fault zones. Hence, they provide a unique insight of these reservoirs' geometry and dynamics over broad time scales. Here we demonstrate that continuous tilt data from surface long baseline tiltmeters (LBT) can be used alone to evaluate the general functioning of a fractured hardrock system and estimate the hydraulic properties of its main conductive features. The study is applied to the pumping site of Ploemeur observatory (Brittany, France) which is well documented and instrumented, and therefore forms a convenient setting for introducing LBT as tools for fractured media hydrology. On the short term, tilt signals are strongly correlated with pumping cycles and associated head level changes in well-connected boreholes. Besides, when pumps are stopped the maximal tilt direction is systematically perpendicular to a subvertical fault zone whose azimuth of strike has thereby been refined down to degree precision. By using a semi-analytical model of deformation, we establish the link between tilt and pressure change during pumping interruptions which then allows for hydraulic properties estimation from tilt measurements only. Finally, we validate our results with previous estimates obtained from other studies and discuss the orientation of future work that could enhance these estimates.",

            "abstract": "Trickle bed reactors are largely used in the refining processes. Co-current heavy oil and hydrogen gas flow downward on catalytic particle bed. Fine particles in the heavy oil and/or soot formed by the exothermic catalytic reactions deposit on the bed and clog the flow channels. This work is funded by the refining company of Abu Dhabi and aims at mitigating pressure buildup due to fine deposition in the TBR.\nIn this work, we focus on meso-scale experimental and computational investigations of the interplay between flow regimes and the various parameters that affect them. A 2D experimental apparatus has been built to investigate the flow regimes with an average pore diameter close to the values encountered in trickle beds. A parametric study is done for the development of flow regimes and the transition between them when the geometry and arrangement of the particles within the porous medium are varied. Liquid and gas flow velocities have also been varied to capture the different flow regimes. Real time images of the multiphase flow are captured using a high speed camera, which were then used to characterize the transition between the different flow regimes. A diffused light source was used behind the 2D Trickle Bed Reactor to enhance visualizations. Experimental data shows very good agreement with the published literature.\nThe computational study focuses on the hydrodynamics of multiphase flow and to identify the flow regime developed inside TBRs using the ANSYS Fluent Software package. Multiphase flow inside TBRs is investigated using the “discrete particle” approach together with Volume of Fluid (VoF) multiphase flow modeling. The effect of the bed particle diameter, spacing, and arrangement are presented that may be used to provide guidelines for designing trickle bed reactors.",

            "abstract": "The combined wide-angle reflection-refraction and multi-channel seismic (MCS) experiment, Galicia 3D, was carried out in 2013 at the Galicia rifted margin in the northeast Atlantic Ocean, west of Spain. The main geological features within the 64 by 20 km (1280 km²) 3D box investigated by the survey are the peridotite ridge (PR), the fault bounded, rotated basement blocks and the S reflector, which has been interpreted to be a low angle detachment fault. 44 short period four-component ocean bottom seismometers and 28 ocean bottom hydrophones were deployed in the 3D box. 3D MCS profiles sampling the whole box were acquired with two airgun arrays of 3300 cu.in. fired alternately every 37.5 m.\nWe present the results from 3D first-arrival time tomography that constrains the P-wave velocity in the 3D box, for the entire depth sampled by reflection data. Results are validated by synthetic tests and by the comparison with Galicia 3D MCS lines. The main outcomes are as follows: 1- The 3.5 km/s iso-velocity contour mimics the top of the acoustic basement observed on MCS profiles. Block bounding faults are imaged as velocity contrasts and basement blocks exhibit 3D topographic variations. 2- On the southern profiles, the top of the PR rises up to 5.5 km depth whereas, 20 km northward, its basement expression (at 6.5 km depth) nearly disappears. 3- The 6.5 km/s iso-velocity contour matches the topography of the S reflector where the latter is visible on MCS profiles. Within a depth interval of 0.6 km (in average), velocities beneath the S reflector increase from 6.5 km/s to 7 km/s, which would correspond to a decrease in the degree of serpentinization from ~45 % to ~30 % if these velocity variations are caused solely by variations in hydration. At the intersections between the block bounding normal faults and the S reflector, this decrease happens over a larger depth interval (> 1 km), suggesting that faults act as conduit for the water flow in the upper mantle.",

Instead, discharge time series used by hydrologists are usually based on simple stage-discharge relations (rating curves) calibrated using a set of direct stage-discharge measurements (gaugings).\nIn this presentation, we present a Bayesian approach to build such hydrometric rating curves, to estimate the associated uncertainty and to propagate this uncertainty to discharge time series. The three main steps of this approach are described:\n(1) Hydraulic analysis: identification of the hydraulic controls that govern the stage-discharge relation, identification of the rating curve equation and specification of prior distributions for the rating curve parameters;\n(2) Rating curve estimation: Bayesian inference of the rating curve parameters, accounting for the individual uncertainties of available gaugings, which often differ according to the discharge measurement procedure and the flow conditions;\n(3) Uncertainty propagation: quantification of the uncertainty in discharge time series, accounting for both the rating curve uncertainties and the uncertainty of recorded stage values.\nIn addition, we also discuss current research activities, including the treatment of non-univocal stage-discharge relationships (e.g. due to hydraulic hysteresis, vegetation growth, sudden change of the geometry of the section, etc.).",

            "abstract": "Climate reconstructions for the pre-instrumental period are either based on climate proxy data or on numerical simulations. However, both approaches are associated with substantial uncertainties. In principle, the best state estimates can be expected by employing data assimilation (DA) techniques, which systematically combine the empirical information from proxy data with the representation of the processes that govern the climate system given by climate models. Here, we reconstruct the climate for 1750-1850 A.D by employing an ensemble member selection DA method, in which the ensembles are generated sequentially for sub-periods based on the analysis of previous sub-periods. The simulated period is very interesting for testing the assimilation method, because of the strong volcanic eruptions, such as the Tambora (Indonesia, 1815 A.D.) and Cosiguina (Nicaragua, 1835 A.D.) eruptions, and their dynamical effects on the ocean and the atmosphere. The period also has several advantages. Firstly, it is directly before the instrumental period and a relatively high number of climate data, e.g. early instrumental records and historical documents, is available for this period. Additionally, a relatively high number of proxies have contributed to the PAGES 2k continental reconstructions which are used in the assimilation, thus reducing errors.\nWe use the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology’s model MPI-ESM. In the so called on-line DA method, a 20-member ensemble was generated for the first year of the analysis period, 1750 A.D, by introducing small perturbations in the atmospheric diffusion field. Simulations with 10-year duration were run, starting from the previous best member's initial conditions, until the year 1850 A.D. We reconstruct different variables of the climate system, such as the surface air temperature, geopotential height and sea-surface temperature, and indices such as the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the Northern and Southern Annular Modes (NAM/SAM) and compare them with various proxy-based and early instrumental reconstructions, which are partly independent of the data that have been assimilated.",

            "abstract": "Flaring is a process during which waste gases are burned in an open atmosphere. The quantification of gas flaring emissions represents a major scientific concern due to its magnitude and related uncertainties. In global/regional emission inventories, this source, though releasing large amounts of pollutants in the atmosphere, is still poorly quantified if not missing. It can represent the main emission source of gaseous compounds and particles in some areas, as observed during the AMMA project in the Gulf of Guinea. Our study focuses on Africa, and includes Nigeria, which is one of the largest natural oil and gas reserve in the world. Africa is an important gas flaring area, since technologies for the exploitation of this energy source and the reduction of flaring activities have been only recently implemented. We have developed an emission inventory for gases and particles from flaring in Africa. We have first compiled the few published available dataset of fuel consumption from flaring. The spatial distribution of CO2 and black carbon (BC) emissions from gas flaring in 2011 is estimated using a methodology based on field reports and remote sensing (DMSP satellite data). Our results point out to the importance of flaring activities into the regional anthropogenic emissions in Africa over the period 1960-2011. Finally, the contribution of flaring to total anthropogenic emission can be large and needs to be accurately quantified.",

            "abstract": "In order to understand aquatic ecosystem functioning it is critical to understand the processes that control the spatial and temporal variations in DOC. DOC concentrations are highly dynamic, however, our understanding at short, high frequency timescales is still limited. Optical sensors which act as a proxy for DOC provide the opportunity to investigate near-continuous DOC variations in order to understand the hydrological and biogeochemical processes that control concentrations at short temporal scales.\nHere we present inferred 15 minute stream water DOC data for a 12 month period at three nested scales (1km2, 3km2 and 31km2) for the Bruntland Burn, a headwater catchment in NE Scotland. High frequency data were measured using FDOM and CDOM probes which work by measuring the fluorescent component and coloured component, respectively, of DOC when exposed to ultraviolet light. Both FDOM and CDOM were strongly correlated (r2 >0.8) with DOC allowing high frequency estimations. Results show the close coupling of DOC with discharge throughout the sampling period at all three spatial scales. However, analysis at the event scale highlights anticlockwise hysteresis relationships between DOC and discharge due to the delay in DOC being flushed from the increasingly large areas of peaty soils as saturation zones expand and increase hydrological connectivity. Lag times vary between events dependent on antecedent conditions. During a 10 year drought period in late summer 2013 it was apparent that very small changes in discharge on a 15 minute timescale result in high increases in DOC. This suggests transport limitation during this period where DOC builds up in the soil and is not flushed regularly, therefore any subsequent increase in discharge results in large DOC peaks. The high frequency sensors also reveal diurnal variability during summer months related to the photo-oxidation, evaporative and biological influences of DOC during the day. This relationship is less significant during the winter months.",

We confirm for these high elevations the generalized weakening of the monsoon already observed in literature accounting here over 50% of reduction in the last 20 years! In the previous period (70s to 90s) gridded an reanalysis data revealed for our reference site a slighter increase of mean temperature and weak increase of precipitation.\nMain climate change driven implications:\n- The accelerated shrinkage of glaciers observed in the last twenty years, usually inferred to the temperature increase during the summer months, is ascribed here mainly to the regional monsoon weakening.\n- Supraglacial lakes confirm the acceleration of the negative mass balance of glaciers due to reduced ice velocities caused by decreased precipitation.\n- Unconnected lakes confirms precisely the observed precipitation trend.\n- The altitudinal limit of the permanent permafrost seems to be unchanged since the beginning ‘90s (probably due to stationary summer temperature).\n- Rivers discharges experienced in the last ten years an increasing concentrated during the monsoon months. The Wavelet Transform Analysis attributes these increases mainly to a strong reduced accumulation (weaker precipitation) which probably induced lower ice velocities of debris covered tongues and a consequent higher melting.",

            "abstract": "Nutrient limitation of primary producers and their consumers can have a large influence on ecosystem productivity. The nature and strength of nutrient limitation is driven both by external factors (nutrient loading) and internal processes (consumer-driven nutrient regeneration). Here we present results from a field study in 16 unproductive headwater lakes in northern subarctic and boreal Sweden where N deposition is low. We assessed the C:N:P stoichiometry of lake water, seston and zooplankton and estimated the consumer driven nutrient regeneration N:P ratio. The elemental imbalances between seston and zooplankton indicated that zooplankton were mainly N limited and regenerated nutrients with low N:P ratios (median 9.7, atomic ratio). The N:P regeneration ratios declined with increasing DOC concentrations, suggesting that catchment release of DOC accentuates the N limitation by providing more P to the lakes. The N:P regeneration ratios were related to responses in phytoplankton bioassays in mid-summer with low N:P regeneration with N limited phytoplankton, and high N:P regeneration with P limited phytoplankton. During other seasons, increased nutrient loading from the surrounding catchments during periods of greater water throughput had stronger effects on phytoplankton nutrient limitation. Our results suggest that herbivore zooplankton are N limited and recycle nutrients with low N:P ratio in low productive lakes with low N deposition. This will, at least during seasons when in-lake processes play an important role in nutrient turn over, contribute to continued N limitation of phytoplankton in these systems. We anticipate that increased N deposition and changes in climate and hydrology may affect this feedback and result in qualitative changes in these ecosystems, changing both autotroph producers and herbivore consumers from N- to P-limitation, eventually affecting important ecosystem characteristics such as productivity and turnover of energy and nutrients.",

The T104 fly-by will present unique opportunity to sound depths of the Titan biggest sea - Kraken Mare. During closest approach, the RADAR will be pointed at nadir and collect data along a 200 km shore-to-shore track of Kraken Mare. Based on the recent May 2013 (T91) nadir observations of Ligeia Mare, which were used to construct a bathymetric profile and determined the sea’s loss tangent, we expect to detect echoes from both surface and seafloor of Kraken with the opportunity to derive the depth and composition of Titan’s largest sea. The possibility to sound the deepest points of Kraken will depend mainly on the liquids absorption, seafloor morphology and surface flatness. Regardless, however, the near-shore returns are expected to provide sea-floor echo’s above the Cassini RADAR’s noise floor. We will present the results of the T104 flyby and contrast them against the results of similar analysis for both Ligeia Mare and Ontario Lacus. When analysed together, the results from all three will help discern the role of lakes/seas in Titan’ overall hydrocarbon-based hydrologic cycle.",

            "abstract": "Prediction of reaction kinetics of fluid/rock interactions represents a critical issue for several geological and engineering concerns. In the specific context of geothermal energy, the relative intensities of primary mineral leaching and secondary phase formation significantly affect porosity and permeability of the reservoir, thereby influencing its hydraulic performance and the efficiency of a geothermal site. Moreover, it is noteworthy that in general, the circulation of aqueous fluids induces only modest modifications of their chemical composition, which slightly deviate from an equilibrium state. Therefore, fluid rock interactions take place at close-to-equilibrium conditions, where the rate-affinity relations are poorly known and intensively debated [1].\nTo unravel these points, in the context of the geothermal power station of Soultz-sous-Forêts (Alsace, France), our strategy consists in (1) investigating the dissolution of the main cleavages of K-spar, one of the prevalent primary minerals in the reservoir, in order to decipher the impact of crystallographic orientation and microstructural surface modifications on the dissolution kinetics and (2) proposing a relation between K-spar dissolution rate and the Gibbs free energy of reaction (∆G) over a wide range of ∆G conditions.\nOur experimental work relies on a coupled approach which combines classical experiments of K-spar dissolution monitored by aqueous chemical analyses (ICPAES) and innovative techniques of nm to μm-scale characterization of solid surface (FIB-TEM, AFM, VSI) [2].\nOur ongoing experiments evidence that K-spar dissolution is an anisotropic process, with faces (-1-1 1) dissolving up to ten times faster than the slowest (001) faces. The complex evolution of surface topography with the occurrence of etch pits is at odds with the shrinking core model implemented in most of reactive-transport codes, representing a possible cause of an apparent modification of silicate dissolution rate over time. In addition, the relation between K-spar dissolution rate and ∆G seems to differ from the transition state theory currently implemented into geochemical codes. Taken together, these new findings show promise as a means for modifying reactive transport codes and improving the predictive ability of geochemical simulations.",

Non-reactive and reactive core flooding experiments have been carried out in sandstone and two carbonate cores with varying degrees of heterogeneity. The dispersion, mixing and reaction of chemical components in an aqueous solution injected into rock cores were visualised in 3D with the use of chemical dopants and a medical x-ray CT scanner. With regards to solid-fluid reactions, the impact of rock dissolution on subsequent chemical transport was observed by injecting a carefully selected acidic solution. Simultaneous observations of the permeability evolution were made along with analysis of the effluent chemistry using an ICP-MS. This has resulted in a high quality 3D data set of the space and time evolution of the concentration of aqueous chemical components in non-reactive and reactive core-flooding experiments in rocks with different degrees of heterogeneity in combination with precise data of the effluent composition and rock permeability. This will allow us to assess the effect of flow and transport heterogeneity on upscaled effective reaction rates. Furthermore, these observations can be used as a future benchmark test for numerical models for chemical transport and fluid-solid reactions and in the development of upscaling techniques for accurate and efficient modelling of chemical processes during flow in porous media.",

            "abstract": "An idealised model describing frazil ice formation in the ocean mixed layer beneath a lead in the sea ice cover is developed and incorporated into the sea ice climate model CICE. The frazil ice model assumes a steady state formation of single size frazil ice crystals. The crystals are uniformly distributed under the lead over the mixed layer depth and the lead width. The basic processes affecting the frazil ice mass balance is the rate of frazil ice formation due to the heat loss from the open water to the atmosphere, advection of heat and frazil ice volume into the lead from the water under sea ice, and precipitation of frazil ice crystals to the ocean surface and formation of grease ice. The grease ice is pushed against one of the lead edges by wind and water drag keeping the lead open. The frazil ice model is incorporated into CICE and used to simulate the sea ice state in the Arctic Basin and Southern Ocean.\nIn contrast to the original frazil ice treatment in CICE which produces sea ice with only around 10% frazil ice fraction, the new model produces of order of 50% of frazil-derived sea ice, which corresponds better to observations. While the original model can be re-tuned in order to produce a similar average fraction of frazil ice by having a frazil collection thickness of 30 cm in the Antarctic and 5 cm in the Arctic, the new model's collection thickness is dynamically calculated, allowing for a larger collection thickness in large leads whereas the old model assumes it to be equal for wide and narrow leads. The new model keeps leads open for a longer period thus increasing the period of frazil ice formation. This is particularly important in the central Arctic where the new model's increased frazil ice production results in sea ice 0.5 m thicker than in the old model.",

            "abstract": "It had been found that there are seasonal variations of seismicity related to surface hydrology at Main Himalaya Thrust (MHT) fault. In this work, we analyzed the historical micro-earthquakes recorded by China Digital Seismograph Network (CSDN) in normal faulting systems in southern Tibet, to test whether such a phenomenon exist here and to figure out the possible modulation mechanism. There are several N-S striking normal fault systems (e.g. Yadong-Gulu, Shenza-Dingjie rifts) across the southern Tibetan plateau, which are supposed to accommodate the crust extension induced by Indo-Eurasia collision. The quake catalog covers the time span of 2008-2014. All quake events are relocated using the double-differencing method. The catalog was then declustered using CLUSTER2000 (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/software/). The declustered catalog was then averaged for one-month period. The monthly catalog shows that the number of earthquake is maximum during the winter months (from January to March), although the maximum values do not agree for individual years (Fig. 1). Such a variation is similar to that found at MHT. Contrary to the situation at MHT (thrust fault), we found it might be explained directly by surface mass redistributions. The contemporary continuous GPS observations confirm that Tibetan plateau crust moves up and down periodically and reaches its lowest position in summer under the surface hydrological load. According to the Coulomb failure criterion (S=τ-μ(σn-pf) , where S is Coulomb Stress, σn is normal stress, τ is shear stress), an increase of mass load in summer in Tibet will cause an increase in normal stress at the (gently dipping) fault plane and accordingly a decrease in Coulomb stress, which thus inhibits the occurrence of quakes on those normal fault planes.",

However, temperatures are considerably higher in many subsurface settings, such as deep saline aquifers, geothermal fields, and hydrocarbon reservoirs; moreover, natural brines are often significantly more saline and contain a wide variety of ionic species. We report measurements of the streaming potential on sandpacks of controlled mineralogy, and intact sandstone core samples, saturated with high salinity natural and artificial brines at elevated temperatures. We measure streaming potential using an experimental set-up that incorporates in-situ measurements of saturated rock conductivity, brine temperature, brine pH, brine electrical conductivity, pressure difference and voltage at temperatures up to 150oC.\nWe find that the streaming potential coupling coefficient and interpreted zeta potential are negative and decrease in magnitude with increasing temperature. Measurements of brine pH show significant decrease with increasing temperature and we suggest this reduces the mineral/brine surface charge and, hence, the zeta potential. Such changes in pH must be accounted for when matching theoretical models to experimental data and when interpreting the streaming potential component of subsurface SP measurements in field settings. The temperature dependence of the zeta potential is consistent between four different natural sandstone samples, and sandpacks composed of two different sands. Increasing the content of multivalent cations in the brine causes a decrease in interpreted zeta potential, consistent with published data at low salinity.",

            "abstract": "Analyzing of the impact of constructive or low energy waves and deconstructive or high energy waves in the ocean are very much significant since they deform the geometry of seashore. The deformation may lead to productive result and also to the end of deteriorate damage. Constructive waves results deposition of sediment which widens the beach where as deconstructive waves results erosion which narrows the beach. Validation of historic sediment transportation and prediction of the direction of movement of seashore is essential to prevent unrecoverable damages by incorporating precautionary measurements to identify the factors that influence sediment transportation if feasible. The objective of this study is to propose a more reliable and energy efficient Information and communication system to model the Coastal Sediment Dynamics. Various factors influencing the sediment drift at a particular region is identified. Consequence of source depth and frequency dependencies of spread pattern in the presence of sediments is modeled. Property of source depth and frequency on sensitivity to values of model parameters are determined. Fundamental physical reasons for these sediment interaction effects are given. Shallow to deep water and internal and external wave model of ocean is obtained intended to get acoustic data assimilation (ADA). Signal processing algorithms are used over the observed data to form a full field acoustic propagation model and construct sound speed profile (SSP). The inversions of data due to uncertainties at various depths are compared. The impact of sediment drift over acoustic data is identified. An energy efficient multipath routing scheme Wireless sensor networks (WSN) is deployed for the well-organized communication of data. The WSN is designed considering increased life time, decreased power consumption, free of threats and attacks. The practical data obtained from the efficient system to model the ocean sediment dynamics are evaluated with remote sensing data and the reasons of deviations and uncertainties are unbiased. The probability of changes and impact of sediment drift over ocean dynamic model over the long running of years is estimated.",

            "abstract": "The bathymetric and magnetic survey, hydrocasting and seabed sampling have been carried out in the middle portion of the Central Indian Ridge (MCIR) between 7°S and 17°S. The MCIR constitutes six first-order segments and seven second-order segments with four non-transform discontinuities (NTDs) and twelve ocean core complexes (OCCs). These segments are characterized by asymmetric accretion that corresponds to about 70% of the surveyed MCIR segment. One of the outstanding NTD in the area is a basin like NTD3-1 at 11°S (50km in length) which strike at 035°, approximately 45° oblique in a clockwise direction to the orientation of two adjoining second-order segments. The hydrothermal activity is recognized at the tips of NTD3-1. No abyssal hills paralleling to basin-shape NTD3-1 are observed. Anomalous depth of the basin, lack of positive magnetic anomaly across the basin and rare seismic activities in the basin floor suggests that extensional tectonism with a sparse volcanism is the dominant process occurring along the NTD3-1. Based on the previous researches that the counterclockwise rotation of ridge is predominant in the area, the region of NTD3-1 largely accommodates shear strain by left-lateral sense motion and consequently forms a transtensional basin, i.e., a pull-apart basin. The strong and frequent hydrothermal plume signals, and highly tectonized rocks in both tips of the NTD3-1 are reflective of the dilation zones or tensional fractures accompanied by the pull-apart basin formation. It is the first identification of a pull-apart basin associated with hydrothermal activity in the Central Indian Ridge.",

            "abstract": "With increasingly abundant high resolution and high precision records of East Asian monsoon, its spatial and temporal dynamics during the Holocene have been extensively studied. However, partly due to the lack of records in high latitude areas and the age uncertainties, these studies characterized a wide range of spatial-temporal patterns of Holocene Optimum (HO). We reconstructed a 14,000-year record of vegetation using sediments from a crater lake in Northeast China. Analyses of the vegetation time series show that HO began around 6,000 a BP in Northeast China, significantly later than generally recognized. By comparison with Holocene records of vegetation in other regions of the East Asia, we found a marked northward shift of initial time of HO from 10,600 a BP in South China to 6,000 a BP in Northeast China, which appeared to be forced by the shrinkage of the northern hemisphere ice-sheet (NHIS) during early to mid Holocene. Finally, we fitted a regression model of initial HO time on latitude, which allows us to make prediction of initial HO time based on their geographical locations. This study reveals a strong relationship between latitude and initial HO times and provides a window towards understanding the joint forcing of high and low latitude factors on regional climate.",

            "abstract": "Several models have been presented in the literature to explain volcanic passive margins (VPMs), including variation in rifting speed or history, enhanced melting from mantle plumes, and enhanced flow through the melting zone by small-scale convection (SSC) driven by lithospheric detachments. Understanding the mechanism is important to constrain the paleo-heat flow and petroleum potential of VPM. Using 2D and 3D numerical models, we investigate the influence of SSC on the rate of crust production during continental rifting. Conceptually, SSC results in up/downwellings with a typical spacing of a few-100 km, and may lead to enhanced decompression melting. Subsequent mantle depletion changes buoyancy (from latent heat consumption and compositional changes), and affects mantle dynamics under the MOR and potentially any further melting.\nDecompression melting leads to a colder, thermally denser residue (from consumption of latent heat of melting), but also a compositionally more buoyant one. A parameter sensitivity study of the effects of mantle viscosity, spreading rate, mantle temperature, and a range material parameters indicates that competition between thermal and compositional buoyancy determines the mantle dynamics. For mantle viscosities ηm > ~1022 Pa s, no SSC occurs, and a uniform 7-8 km-thick oceanic crust forms. For ηm < ~1021 Pa s, SSC is vigorous and can form VPMs with > 10-20 km crust. If thermal density effects dominate, a vigorous (inverted) convection may drive significant decompression melting, and create VPMs. Such dynamics could also explain the continent-dipping normal faults that are commonly observed at VPMs. After the initial rifting phase, the crustal thickness reduces significantly, but not always to a uniformly thick 7-8 km, as would be appropriate for mature oceanic basins. Transverse convection rolls may result in margin-parallel crustal thickness variation, possibly related to observations such as the East-Coast Magnetic Anomaly.",

Stimulated microbial growth in such applications could cause wide variety of changes of physical/chemical properties in the subsurface; however, due to the complexity of subsurface systems,it is difficult to monitor the growth of microbes and microbial activity in porous media. The focus of this research is to determine if low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), a method used in well logging to characterize fluids in hydrocarbon reservoirs or water in aquifers, can be used to directly detect the presence and the growth of microbes in geologic media.\nIn this laboratory study, low-field NMR (2 MHz) relaxation measurements were collected on microbial suspensions with measured densities (i.e. biomasses), microbial pellets (live and dead), and inoculated silica. We focus on the direct contribution of microbes to the NMR signals in the absence of biomineralization. Shewanella oneidensis (MR-1), a facultative metal reducer known to play an important role in subsurface environments, were used as a model organism and were inoculated under aerobic condition. Data were collected using a CPMG pulse sequence, which was to determine the T2-distribution, and using a gradient spin-echo (PGSE) plus CPMG pulse sequence, which was used to encode diffusion properties and determine the effective diffusion–spin-spin relaxation correlation (D-T2) plot. Our data show no obvious change in the T2-distribution as S. oneidensis density varied in suspension, but show a clear distinction in the T2-distribution and D-T2 plots between live and dead cell pellets. A decrease in the T2-distribution is observed in the inoculated sand column. These results will provide a basis for understanding the effect of microbes within geologic media on low-field NMR measurements. This research is necessary to determine if NMR measurements can ultimately to be used to monitor microbial growth and activity in oil reservoirs or contaminated aquifers.",

            "abstract": "Simultaneous monitoring of different gas species of volcanic plumes is crucial to understand the mechanisms involved in persistent degassing, and to anticipate volcanic unrest episodes and magma ascent towards the surface. Progress in gas remote-sensing techniques during the last decades has led to the development of ultraviolet absorption spectrometers and UV cameras, which enable to monitor SO2 emission cycles in real time, at very high-frequency (~ 1Hz), and from several kilometers away from the volcanic plume. However, monitoring of the more abundant gases, i.e., H2O and CO2, is limited to volcanoes where infrared spectrometers and infrared lamps can be installed at both sides of the crater rims. In this study, we present a new and simple methodology to register H2O emission cycles from long distances (several kilometers), which is based on the light scattered by the micrometric water droplets of condensed plumes. The method only requires a commercial digital camera and a laptop for image processing, since, as we demonstrate, there is a linear correlation between the digital brightness of the plume and its volcanogenic water content. We have validated the method experimentally by generating controlled condensed plumes with an ultrasonic humidifier, and applied it to the plume of Erebus volcano using a 30 minutes-long movie [1]. The wavelet transforms of the plume brightness and SO2 time series (measured with DOAS [1]) show two common periodic components in the bands ~100­-250 s and ~500-­650 s. However, there is a third periodic component in the band ~300-­450 s in the SO2 time series that is absent in the brightness time series. We propose that the common periodic components are induced by magmatic foams collapsing intermittently beneath shallow geometrical barriers composed by bubbles with high content of both H2O and SO2, whereas the third periodic component could be induced by foams collapsing beneath a deeper geometrical barrier composed by bubbles with high content of SO2 but low content of H2O. This is consistent with the fact that most of the water exsolves at very low pressures. Our new methodology should lead to new insights into magma degassing process and anticipation of volcanic eruptions, in particular when combined with other monitoring methods. [1] Boichu et al.

            "abstract": "Paleoenvironmental reconstruction is among the main targets of the International Continental Drilling Program (ICDP)-sponsored Dead Sea Deep Drilling Project (DSDDP). Around 450 meters of core were retrieved and currently several multi-disciplinary studies are being performed in this almost continuous sedimentary record. Careful attention has been directed to understanding the microbial communities living in the hypersaline sediment and the potential impact they might have on biogeochemical cycles both in the lake and in the Dead Sea precursors. Studies have highlighted the potential for microbial activity in the lake, in spite of its hypersalinity, and the putative influence of microbial communities on the geochemical record, especially with respect to reconstruction of the carbon and sulfur cycles. More recently, geomicrobiological and geochemical studies with samples obtained during the DSDDP have revealed the potential for methane production (methanogenesis) in the subsurface; this can greatly impact the carbon isotope record in the subsurface and could skew any paleoenvironmental interpretation. By combining carbon, sulfur and oxygen isotopes from the interstitial pore water and the surrounding sediment, including a lithological facies study and biomarker analysis, we highlight that the period following massive gypsum precipitation in the Dead Sea, at the onset of the Holocene, has been subject to major changes. At this time, variations in the level of the lake, accompanied by water mixing, have supposedly initiated intense microbial activity in the paleo-water column and probably within the sediment after its burial, as indicated by specific authigenic Fe-S mineralizations. Sulfur isotope evidence from the pore fluids suggests that these Fe-S precipitations may be microbial in nature. While no DNA could be extracted from this interval to allow a microbial diversity study, the retrieval, among others, of non-isoprenoid macrocyclic glycerol diethers potentially calls for the presence and influence of extremophiles involved in sulfur cycling. Current work will help unravel the extent of the biological impact on proxies that could be used for paleoclimatic studies. Additionally, this work highlights the importance of routinely implementing geobiological studies within the ICDP framework.",

In remote areas, the atmosphere is characterized by low particle number concentrations and high humidity; perturbations in the particle number concentrations and climate-relevant physical and chemical properties could therefore have a great impact on cloud formation and thus on regional climate and precipitation. While it was previously believed that new particle formation occurs rarely in the Amazon, observations in the Amazon of a sustained steady-state particle number concentration, along with an abundance of dry and wet surfaces upon which particles may deposit, imply that sources of new particles must exist in this region.\nWe present observations from two studies, GOAmazon2014 and Tapajos Upwind Forest Flux Study (TUFFS), which seek to identify and quantify the sources of aerosol particles in the Amazon. Measurements of the chemical composition of 20 – 100 nm diameter aerosol particles at the T3 measurement site during the wet and dry season campaigns of GOAmazon2014 show the presence of inorganic ions such as potassium ion and sulfate, as well as organic ion such as oxalate, in ambient nanoparticles. These observations, combined with 1.5 – 300 nm diameter particle number size distributions and trace gas measurements of organic compounds and sulfuric acid, are used to determine the relative importance of sulfuric acid, organic compounds, and primary biological particle emissions to nanoparticle formation and growth. Observations of 3 – 100 nm diameter particle number size distributions at the KM67 tower site during TUFFS show frequent new particle formation events during the wet season in April, transitioning to a scenario of less frequent events in July at the onset of the dry season. These observations highlight the regional nature of new particle formation in the Amazon, and suggest that additional observations at a variety of locales are needed to fully understand the roles of new particle formation in this region.",

Many studies have been devoted for the region up to the stratopause level from both observational and theoretical aspects. However, observational evidence is still fragmentary in the region above the stratopause, because global data capable of comprehensive analyses are still insufficient for the region. In this study, we make global gridpoint data derived from Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) observations for geopotential and temperature fields up to the mesopause level. Using these data, we make dynamical analyses for equatorial zonal wind and temperature changes since June 2004 to present. During SSW events, poleward flows of the residual mean meridional circulation are enhanced to lead to equatorial temperature perturbations consisting of a cooling in the upper stratosphere and a warming in the lower mesosphere. These temperature perturbations are found to strengthen the equatorial semiannual oscillation (SAO) with two separate out-of-phase amplitude maxima centered near the stratopause (SSAO) and the middle mesosphere (MSAO) through the thermal wind balance at the equator. In particular, the large amplification of the SAO is clearly observed during mid-winter SSW events when the SSAO and the MSAO have eastely and westerly maxima respectively. Moreover, we compare the results with simulated ones by a general circulation model.",

This SOC is potentially vulnerable to remobilization following soil warming and permafrost thaw, but stock estimates are poorly constrained and quantitative error estimates were lacking. This study presents revised estimates of the permafrost SOC pool, including quantitative uncertainty estimates, in the 0–3 m depth range in soils as well as for deeper sediments (> 3 m) in deltaic deposits of major rivers and in the Yedoma region of Siberia and Alaska. The revised estimates are based on significantly larger databases compared to previous studies. Compared to previous studies, the number of individual sites/pedons has increased by a factor ×8–11 for 1–3 m soils, a factor ×8 for deltaic alluvium and a factor ×5 for Yedoma region deposits.\nA total estimated mean storage for the permafrost region of ca. 1300–1400 Pg with an uncertainty range of 1050–1650 Pg encompasses the revised estimates. Of this, ≤900 Pg is perennially frozen. While some components of the revised SOC stocks are similar in magnitude to those previously reported for this region, there are also substantial differences in individual components.\nThere is evidence of substantial remaining regional data-gaps.

            "abstract": "Here we extend the numerical convection models of Venus models of [1], which included melting, magmatism, decaying heat-producing elements, core cooling, realistic temperature-dependent viscosity and either stagnant lid or episodic lithospheric overturn. In [1] it was found that for stagnant lid convection the dominant mode of heat loss is magmatic heat pipe, which requires massive magmatism and produces very thick, cold crust, inconsistent with observations. In contrast, episodic lid overturn interspersed by periods of quiescence effectively loses Venus’s heat while giving lower rates of volcanism and a thinner crust. Calculations predict 5–8 overturn events over Venus’s history, each lasting ∼150 Myr, initiating in one place and then spreading globally. Venus-like amplitudes of topography and geoid can be produced in either stagnant or episodic modes, with a viscosity profile that is Earth-like but shifted to higher values. Here we extend [1] by considering intrusive magmatism as an alternative to the purely extrusive magmatism previously assumed. Intrusive magmatism warms and weakens the crust, resulting in substantial surface deformation and a thinner crust. This is further enhanced by using a basaltic rheology for the crust instead of assuming the same rheological parameters as for the mantle. In some cases massive intrusive magmatism can even lead to episodic lithospheric overturn events without plastic yielding. Here we quantitatively analyse the resulting surface deformation and other signatures, and compare to observations in order to constrain the likely ratio of intrusive to extrusive magmatism.\n[1] Armann, M., and P.

            "abstract": "Speleothems have emerged as one of the best sources of terrestrial palaeoclimate information. They have the potential to preserve long and continuous records, contain multiple climate-sensitive properties and can be accurately and precisely dated. These characteristics ideally position speleothems to refine the chronology of climate events recorded in ice and marine sediment. In recent years we have seen a dramatic improvement in analytical instrumentation available for high-resolution, in situ stable isotope and trace element analysis. These techniques present the opportunity to obtain palaeoclimate reconstructions from slow-growing speleothems, such as subaqueous deposits, which have largely been overlooked for palaeoclimate research. Here, we present the use of microanalytical techniques to obtain a ‘high-resolution’ palaeoclimate reconstruction from an exceptionally slow growing (~0.3 mm kyr-1) subaqueous calcite mound from Corchia Cave, NW Italy. A 23-cm-long core through this speleothem provides a ~continuous climatic record extending back almost 1 Ma. In this pilot investigation, we use microanalytical techniques to obtain a palaeoclimate reconstruction from the top ~2 cm of the core, which represents the last ~120 kyr. Micron-scale trace element analyses were performed by X-ray micro-fluorescence at the ESRF (Grenoble, France), with complementary analyses using laser ablation ICPMS at the University of Melbourne (Australia). Stable oxygen isotope microanalysis was performed using the Sensitive High Resolution Ion Micro Probe Stable Isotope (SHRIMP SI) at the ANU (Canberra, Australia). This is the first time that this suite of techniques has been applied to a single specimen of speleothem calcite. High-resolution uranium-thorium dating has been undertaken to provide age constraints. This research demonstrates the potential application of multiple high-resolution analytical techniques to complex speleothems, and presents exciting opportunities to analyse slow-growing speleothems and to obtain high temporal (sub-annual) resolution palaeoclimate reconstructions. The successful application of such techniques to the Corchia speleothem will permit a unique, 1 Myr climate record to be obtained in the future.",

            "abstract": "Reanalyses gain more and more importance as a source of meteorological information for many purposes and applications. Several global reanalyses projects (e.g., ERA, MERRA, CSFR, JMA9) produce and verify these data sets to provide time series as long as possible combined with a high data quality. Due to a spatial resolution down to 50-70km and 3-hourly temporal output, they are not suitable for small scale problems (e.g., regional climate assessment, meso-scale NWP verification, input for subsequent models such as river runoff simulations). The implementation of regional reanalyses based on a limited area model along with a data assimilation scheme is able to generate reanalysis data sets with high spatio-temporal resolution.\nWithin the Hans-Ertel-Centre for Weather Research (HErZ), the climate monitoring branch concentrates efforts on the assessment and analysis of regional climate in Germany and Europe. In joint cooperation with DWD (German Meteorological Service), a high-resolution reanalysis system based on the COSMO model has been developed. The regional reanalysis for Europe matches the domain of the CORDEX EURO-11 specifications, albeit at a higher spatial resolution, i.e., 0.055° (6km) instead of 0.11° (12km) and comprises the assimilation of observational data using the existing nudging scheme of COSMO complemented by a special soil moisture analysis with boundary conditions provided by ERA‐Interim data. The reanalysis data set covers 6 years (2007-2012) and is currently extended to 16 years.\nExtensive evaluation of the reanalysis is performed using independent observations with special emphasis on precipitation and high-impact weather situations indicating a better representation of small scale variability. Further, the evaluation shows an added value of the regional reanalysis with respect to the forcing ERA Interim reanalysis and compared to a pure high-resolution dynamical downscaling approach without data assimilation.",

            "abstract": "Although our understanding of fluvial processes has made significant progress over the last decades, river classification and the derived knowledge about river systems has so far been based on discontinuous sampling along the river course through field works and/or (subjective) interpretation of aerial images. Pioneer continuous longitudinal characterization of river reach or network used aerial photographs and highlighted planimetric patterns (mainly channel style, width and sinuosity) but did not consider elevation which is a very important parameter of channel forms. LiDAR being now more frequently available at large scale, a new step is to introduce such information in the longitudinal river characterization.\nWe propose a river characterization, applied to 60km of the river Orco, located in Piedmont region, Italy, based on remote sensing data available at regional scale: namely color infrared orthophotos at 40 cm and a LIDAR derived DTM at 5 m acquired simultaneously in 2009-2010. Thirteen geomorphic variables are extracted virtually continuously along the river describing three river components: channel planform features (e.g. number of water channels and sinuosity), floodplain features (e.g. valley bottom shape), channel settings (e.g. width, confinement and slope), in-channel topography (e.g. bed relief index). A multi-dimensional river segmentation is performed applying the Hubert test: river styles are distinguished based on the density of discontinuities in channel planform features. Discontinuities in floodplain and channel settings are related to river style transitions and analyzed quantitatively. Specific river geomorphic signatures based on the distributions of the geomorphic variables are defined for each river style. The proposed segmentation matches remarkably well stretches where distinct channel adjustment processes of river bed aggradation and incision occurred, as shown by 1974 and 2003 cross-section comparisons. The method is completely data driven and should be soon applied at regional scale paving the way towards more quantitative large-scale river hydromorphological characterizations.",

A magnetotelluric (MT) profile crossing the eastern margin of WB, southern TNCO and western margin of EB, combined with a subset of SinoProbe MT array near this profile is used in our study. Dimensionality analysis indicates that (a) the resistivity structure is nearly 2-D with geoelectric strike directions varying in different tectonic units, and that (b) electrical anisotropy may exist in the mid-lower crust beneath the Shanxi Rift and Qinshui Basin. Isotropic and anisotropic 2-D inversion and isotropic 3-D inversions have been conducted. The most significant resistivity features in the inversion models are a series of mid-lower crustal sub-horizontal blob-like conductors beneath Shanxi Rift and an east-dipping conductor extending from mid crust to a depth greater than 150 km beneath the southern Taihang Mountains. Inversions show that the crustal conductor series may represent an anisotropic layer, likely caused by conductive materials filling a network of fractures with preferred spatial orientation. The dipping conductor may represent a conduit of hot asthenospheric materials transporting upwards, which is interpreted to the leading edge of the eastward escape mantle flow caused by Indian-Asia collision. The hot materials are inferred to be resulted from the westward mantle convection associated with the westward subducting Pacific Slab, going upward into the mid-lower crustal detachment zone and heat the rock, generating partial melts filling the fractures beneath Shanxi rift. The rift system is believed to be associated with NW–SE-trending extensional stress field resulted from the rapid convergence of India–Eurasia. Thus, conclusion can be drawn that the deformation of the lithosphere beneath NCC, especially the TNCO, may be a far-field effect of Indian-Asia collision.",

            "abstract": "One of the main scientific objectives of the Comet Nucleus Sounding Experiment by Radiowave Transmission (CONSERT) aboard Rosetta is to perform a dielectric characterization of comet 67P/Chuyurmov-Gerasimenko’s nucleus by means of a bi-static sounding between the lander Philae launched onto the comet’s surface and the orbiter Rosetta. For the sounding, the lander part of CONSERT will receive and process the radio signal emitted by the orbiter part of the instrument and transmit a signal to the orbiter to be received by CONSERT.\nCONSERT will also be operated as bi-static RADAR during the descent of the lander Philae onto the comet's surface. From data measured during the descent, we aim at reconstructing a surface permittivity map of the comet at the landing site and along the path below the descent trajectory. This surface permittivity map will give information on the bulk material right below and around the landing site and the surface roughness in areas covered by the instrument along the descent.\nThe proposed method to estimate the surface permittivity distribution is based on a least-squares based inversion approach in frequency domain. The direct problem of simulating the wave-propagation between lander and orbiter at line-of-sight and the signal reflected on the comet's surface is modelled using a dielectric physical optics approximation.\nRestrictions on the measurement positions by the descent orbitography and limitations on the instrument dynamic range will be dealt with by application of a regularization technique where the surface permittivity distribution and the gradient with regard to the permittivity is projected in a domain defined by a viable model of the spatial material and roughness distribution. The least-squares optimization step of the reconstruction is performed in such domain on a reduced set of parameters yielding stable results.\nThe viability of the proposed method is demonstrated by reconstruction results based on simulated data.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the snow cover distribution is important to improve the assessment of water resource and prediction of snow related disasters. The predominant elements of snow cover in mountain area depend on the horizontal precipitation gradients on a regional scale. Improvement of the estimation accuracy of snow depth in mountain area is important to the reproducibility of orographic precipitation. We adopt the altitudinal dependency of snow depth (ADSD) as the estimation accuracy index of horizontal precipitation gradients. The aim of this study is to clarify the main factors causing regional difference of ADSD using high-density surface observational data and numerical experiments. Additionally, we perform sensitivity experiments to investigate the orography effect on the regional difference of ADSD. The sensitivity experiment was performed under the condition in which the altitude of the specific single mountain at an altitude about 1000 m A. S. L. was eliminated and treated as a plain area. The 4.5km and 1.5km numerical experiments were carried out using WRF Version 3.4. We executed the simulation focusing on heavy snow winter seasons and light snow winter season. We mainly analyzed in 2005/2006 heavy snow winter season in coastal area of the Japan Sea.\nAs the results, ADSD shows a high gradient and low variation in the windward area. Inversely, it shows low gradient and high variation in the leeward area (Figure a). The regional difference of ADSD in 1.5km experiments reproduces better than 4.5 km experiment (Figure b and c). These results indicate that the regional difference of ADSD is influenced by orography. Hence, we performed a sensitivity experiment to clarify the impact of orography on regional difference of ADSD. There are no apparent the regional differences of ADSD between windward and leeward area in the sensitivity experiments. These results indicate that ADSD differs between the windward and leeward areas because ADSD is primarily controlled by the spatial distribution of snow depth and snowfall affected by orographic precipitation. ADSD is complex in the mountainous areas. In particular, the spatial variation of ADSD is reinforced in the leeward area. These results suggest a need for high resolution experiments when assessing snow cover and snowfall in complex mountain areas.",

Here, we use X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy to examine the redox speciation of marine particulate iron from the Peruvian OMZ to understand the redox cycling processes that generate and maintain elevated Fe concentrations. We hypothesized that Fe(III) oxyhydroxides would be highest at the regions of highest horizontal and vertical oxygen gradients, where dissolved Fe(II) would be lost to oxidization, but found instead that the highest oxyhydroxide concentrations were in oxygen deficient waters on the Peruvian shelf where dissolved Fe(II) was highest. The oxyhydroxides were dominated by the lepidocrocite (gamma-FeOOH) form, which is generally thought to require dissolved Fe(II) for its formation. Although lepidocrocite is relatively common in soils and freshwater systems, there are few reports of its presence in marine systems. Lepidocrocite has been shown to stimulate Fe(II)-dependent nitrite reduction in soils, and we suggest that it may also play a role here in nitrogen cycling.",

            "abstract": "The geochemistry of skeletal aragonite deposited by massive tropical corals preserves a valuable record of past climate. In particular, coral skeletal Sr/Ca records sea surface temperature (SST) at the time of deposition and is a widely used palaeothermometer. However, SSTs estimated from many fossil corals are significantly cooler than those predicted from other proxies and climate models. Accurately interpreting the SST records encoded in coral aragonite requires a greater understanding of the controls on skeletal Sr/Ca, including the effect of variations in seawater pH. We have developed an aquarium system to culture corals over a range of pCO2 scenarios that range from the last glacial maximum (180 ppm) to levels projected by the end of this century (750 ppm). We acclimated heads of massive Porites corals, the coral genus most commonly used in palaeoenvironmental studies, to four pCO2 scenarios over a period of > 6 months. Using SIMS we are measuring the Sr/Ca of the aragonite deposited over a five-week experimental period, following this long acclimation, at a 1-2 day resolution. We explore the relationship between seawater pH and skeletal Sr/Ca, and we investigate how skeletal Sr/Ca varies between fast- and slow-growing axes within the same coral, and between different genotypes within the same treatment. We have quantified net photosynthesis, respiration and calcification rates in each coral head throughout the experimental period, and we observe that calcification in the light is significantly reduced at a pCO2 of 750 ppm compared to 180 ppm (0.94 ± 0.17 and 0.45 ± 0.23 µmol CaCO3 cm-2 hr-1, respectively; p < 0.01). We investigate whether these differences influence skeletal geochemistry within our controlled culture conditions. Understanding the effect of changes in seawater pH, metabolic and calcification rates on the Sr/Ca of coral skeletons will significantly advance the application of this proxy in past climate reconstruction.",

            "abstract": "A first-order observation in magmatic rocks is that highly evolved rhyolites are relatively abundant in the volcanic realm, but their plutonic counterparts (granites sensu stricto) are rarer, when ratioed to dacitic/granodioritic compositions. As eruptability is a function of the buoyancy of magmas in upper crustal reservoirs, the presence of exsolved gas (bubbles) plays a fundamental role on eruptability by lowering the bulk density of magmas. Then, if exsolved gas content can accumulate in certain areas of magma reservoirs, it follows that such areas might be more prone to erupt.\nMagma reservoirs in the upper crust likely have relatively stable, sharp transitions in crystallinity between crystal-rich regions and crystal-poor regions. With this framework in mind, in this presentation, by means of theoretical considerations, numerical modelling and laboratory experiments, we suggest that the storage capacity of exsolved gas in magma reservoirs is a function of the relative abundance of melt respect to crystals present; crystal-poor regions (high melt to crystal volume ratio) tend to act as sponges, accumulating bubbles, while crystal-rich regions (mush zones with low melt to crystal ratio) tend to degas efficiently, leading to upward percolation of volatiles. Hence, melt-rich cupolas accumulating in upper parts of crystal-rich upper crustal reservoirs are particularly eruptible and dominate the volume of volcanic deposits in silicic magmatic provinces.",

            "abstract": "Seasonal variation of aragonite saturation state (Ωarag) in the North Pacific Ocean (NPO) was investigated, using multiple linear regression (MLR) models produced from the PACIFICA (Pacific Ocean interior carbon) dataset. Data within depth ranges of 50–1200m were used to derive MLR models, and three parameters (potential temperature, nitrate, and apparent oxygen utilization (AOU)) were chosen as predictor variables because these parameters are associated with vertical mixing, DIC (dissolved inorganic carbon) removal and release which all affect Ωarag in water column directly or indirectly.\nThe PACIFICA dataset was divided into 5° × 5° grids, and a MLR model was produced in each grid, giving total 145 independent MLR models over the NPO. Mean RMSE (root mean square error) and r2 (coefficient of determination) of all derived MLR models were approximately 0.09 and 0.96, respectively. Then the obtained MLR coefficients for each of predictor variables and an intercept were interpolated over the study area, thereby making possible to allocate MLR coefficients to data-sparse ocean regions. Predictability from the interpolated coefficients was evaluated using Hawaiian time-series data, and as a result mean residual between measured and predicted Ωarag values was approximately 0.08, which is less than the mean RMSE of our MLR models.\nThe interpolated MLR coefficients were combined with seasonal climatology of World Ocean Atlas 2013 (1° × 1°) to produce seasonal Ωarag distributions over various depths. Large seasonal variability in Ωarag was manifested in the mid-latitude Western NPO (24–40°N, 130–180°E) and low-latitude Eastern NPO (0–12°N, 115–150°W). In the Western NPO, seasonal fluctuations of water column stratification appeared to be responsible for the seasonal variation in Ωarag (~ 0.5 at 50 m) because it closely followed temperature variations in a layer of 0–75 m. In contrast, remineralization of organic matter was the main cause for the seasonal variation in Ωarag (> 0.5) found at depths between 50 and 100 m in the Eastern NPO. In fact, the predicted seasonal variation in Ωarag in this region was successfully reproduced from DIC production expected by change in AOU.",

            "abstract": "The statistical assumption of stationarity in hydrologic extreme time/event series has been relied heavily in frequency analysis. However, due to the analytically perceivable impacts of climate change, urbanization and concomitant land use pattern, assumption of stationarity in hydrologic time series will draw erroneous results, which inturn effects the policy and decision-making. Past studies provided sufficient evidences on changes in the characteristics of Indian monsoon rainfall extremes and further it has been attributed to climate change and urbanization, which indicates the presence of significant nonstationary in the Indian monsoon extremes. Therefore, a comprehensive nonstationary frequency analysis must be conducted all over India to obtain realistic return periods. The present study aims to conduct a nonstationary frequency analysis of the precipitation extremes over India at 1o resolution for a period of 1901-2004, with the implementation of the Generalized Additive Model for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) parameters. A cluster of 74 GAMLSS models has been developed by considering nonstationary in different combinations of distribution parameters and regression techniques (families of parametric polynomials and nonparametric/smoothing cubic spline), which overcomes the limitations of the previous studies. Further, for identification of urban, urbanizing and rural grids, an population density data has been utilized. The results showed the significant differences in the stationary and nonstationary return periods for the urbanizing grids, when compared to urbanized and rural grids. The results give implications of presence of nonstationary in the precipitation extremes more prominently in urbanizing areas compare to urbanized and rural areas.",

            "abstract": "Pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) are a destructive volcanic hazard. Quantifying the types, frequency and magnitudes of PDC events in the geological record is essential for effective risk management. However small-medium volume valley-confined PDC deposits have low preservation potential, especially when emplaced in active drainages or onto snow or ice. Where PDC deposits are preserved they can be difficult to distinguish from other surficial deposits and are frequently misinterpreted or overlooked. This is the case at Mt. Ruapehu; a much visited, high-risk active volcano in New Zealand with no historical PDCs. Through systematic field observations we identified several young proximal-medial andesitic PDC deposits exposed on Ruapehu’s eastern flanks. The oldest deposits (Ohinewairua PDCs, <13.6 ka) are massive pumice-rich deposits that are preserved at least 7km from source (North Crater) and correlate with Ruapehu’s largest plinian eruptions. Overlying these, the pumice-rich Pourahu PDC deposit reaches >10km from source (South Crater) and correlates with Ruapehu’s last known plinian eruption (~11.6 ka). Several younger locally preserved PDC deposits (Tukino PDCs) with denser juvenile clasts represent proximal PDCs from smaller eruptions at South Crater. Finally, a variably welded, bedded deposit containing clasts of welded spatter is interpreted to represent multiple failures of near-vent (North Ruapehu) accumulations of erupted material. Here, PDC initiation appears to have been controlled by the topographic gradient and deposition rate, without requiring a collapsing eruption column. The Ruapehu deposits highlight the limited preservation of PDC deposits, which appears to be favoured at PDC margins. Lateral and vertical flow stratification means the resulting deposits may not then represent the bulk flow. Additionally, deposit textures, distributions, and associations with moraines indicate that many of Ruapehu's PDCs encountered glacial ice during transport. This affected their distribution, mobility and preservation, and has implications for assessing the PDC hazard at Ruapehu and other glaciated volcanoes. The deposits reinforce that hazardous PDCs threatening life and infrastructure may be generated even from small eruptions and across a wide range of eruption styles.",

It is believed to be the main source of strong interplanetary disturbances that may cause intense geomagnetic storms. We use observations from WIND spacecraft to study solar wind conditions from 1996 to 2013, corresponding to complete Solar Cycle 23 and the increasing and maximum phases of Solar Cycle 24, and summarize their basic properties. We identified 444 ICMEs in the near-Earth solar wind during this period. The ICME occurrence rate increases (from 9 in 1996 to 49 in 2001) with solar activity. We compare the properties (magnetic, velocity, southward magnetic field Bs, proton temperature, plasma thermal pressures) of ICMEs in increasing phases of Solar Cycle 23 to those in increasing phase of Solar Cycle 24. We can see clearly that the properties of ICME in Solar Cycle 24 is weaker than those in Solar Cycle 23. We also analyse the ICME’s geoeffectiveness. There are only 7 strong geomagnetic storms (minDst< -100nT) in Solar Cycle 24, nearly one order of magnitude smaller than that found in Solar Cycle 23. This may be caused by the weaker ICME properties in Solar Cycle 24.",

            "abstract": "In the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake Tsunami Disaster, the actual tsunami heights had exceeded the estimated heights extremely and the underestimation caused serious damages in Japan. To reduce such a risk, multi tsunami scenarios were examined especially considering Large Slip Zone (LSZ) and Super Large Slip Zone (SLSZ) suggested by the Cabinet Office, Government of Japan. In the Nankai trough, 11 tsunami faults were assumed. Even if their magnitudes are same, the tsunami heights attacking coastal cities are quite different due to locations of LSZ and SLSZ. For example, the difference is about 5 meters at Tanabe city, Wakayama prefecture. Therefore, the multi tsunami scenario considering LSZ and SLSZ is very important in the tsunami disaster mitigation. However, it is not cleared how to consider the uncertainly in tsunami scenario. A model of predicting the scenarios is proposed in this study. The model consists of areas, dislocations, shapes, locations of LSZ and SLSZ, and the initial crack location. A couple or two couples of LSZ and SLSZ are examined. This model can be applied to any plate boundaries in the world. And it can make the multi tsunami scenario systematically after determining some parameters such as the ratios of area and dislocation of LSZ to a tsunami fault. The model was applied for the Nankai Trough to predict multi scenario of future large tsunamis and its detailed procedure was shown.",

            "abstract": "Cruise ANT-29/8 (SWEAP) of RV Polarstern in November 2013 headed for the Oblique Supersegment of the Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) in the “Furious Fifties” to recover 10 ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) after recording earthquake activity for a period of one year. The OBS recovery was flanked by a multidisciplinary science program that searched in difficult sea conditions for signs of hydrothermal venting, examined deep-sea fauna and determined the thermal regime of this rift section.\nThe seismic activity that accompanies crustal generation at ultraslow spreading mid-ocean ridges is hardly known. We present here preliminary results from the first-ever long-term deployment of OBS networks at two locations of the SWIR. We instrumented the segment 8 volcano near 65°E with 8 OBS and the amagmatically spreading Oblique Supersegment with 10 OBS, two of which returned no data. The networks had dimensions of 60 km x 40 km and a comparable station spacing of about 15 km. A first data analysis suggests that the seismic activity of the magmatic segment is about 4 times as high as that of the magmatically starved Oblique Supersegment. Interestingly, the segment 8 volcano itself displays a prominent seismic gap with a complete absence even of small earthquakes while the adjacent rift valley hosts earthquakes down to 15 km depth indicating a cold lithosphere. This spatial earthquake distribution may reflect an up-doming lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary that has been postulated to guide melts towards the widely spaced volcanoes of ultraslow spreading ridges.",

            "abstract": "It has been believed that water is carried into the deep Earth’s interior by hydrous minerals such as the dense hydrous magnesium silicates (DHMSs) in the descending cold plate. Recently, the new high pressure phase of DHMSs is theoretically predicted (Tsuchiya 2013) and experimentally confirmed in lower mantle pressure conditions above ~45 GPa (Nishi et al. 2014). This phase has MgSiO4H2 chemical composition and named as phase H.\nAt the lower mantle pressure conditions, Al and H-bearing SiO2, δ-AlOOH, ε-FeOOH and phase H may be the potential hydrous phases in the subducting slabs. Interestingly, the crystal structure of these hydrous phases are almost same and have CaCl2 type structure. This suggests that these hydrous phases may be able to make the wide range of solid solution. Some experimental studies already reported that Al preferentially partitioned into phase H and the stability of phase H drastically increased by incorporation of Al (Nishi et al. 2014, Ohira et al. 2014). The density of subducted MORB is reported to be denser than that of pyrolite in the lower mantle. Therefore, there is a possibility that phase H containing Al and Fe in subducted MORB survive down to the bottom of lower mantle and the melting of phase H at the core mantle boundary may contribute to the cause of ultra-low velocity zones.\nIn this study, we report the effects of Al and Fe on the stability of phase H, elasticity and seismic anisotropy of this new hydrous mineral using first principles calculation techniques and discuss the possible effects of this hydrous phase at the bottom of lower mantle.",

            "abstract": "Biomass burning, often related to agricultural deforestation, not only affects local pollution levels but periodically deteriorates air quality in many South East Asian megacities due to the transboundary transport of smoke-haze. In June 2013, Singapore experienced the worst wildfire related air-pollution event on record following from the escalation of peatland fires in Sumatra. An extended dry period together with anomalous westerly winds resulted in severe and unhealthy pollution levels in Singapore that lasted for more than two weeks.\nReacting to this event, the Met Office and the Meteorological Service Singapore have explored how to adequately simulate haze-pollution dispersion, with the aim to provide a reliable operational forecast for Singapore. Simulations with the Lagrangian particle model NAME (Numerical Atmospheric-dispersion Modelling Environment), running on numerical weather prediction data from the Met Office and Meteorological Service Singapore and emission data derived from satellite observations of the fire radiative power, are validated against PM10 observations in South East Asia. Comparisons of simulated concentrations with hourly averages of PM10 measurements in Singapore show that the model captures well the severe smoke-haze event in June 2013 and a minor episode in March 2014. Different quantitative satellite-derived emissions have been tested, with one source demonstrating a consistent factor of two under-prediction for Singapore. Confidence in the skill of the model system has been substantiated by further comparisons with data from monitoring sites in Malaysia, Brunei and Thailand.\nFollowing the validation study, operational smoke-haze pollution forecasts with NAME were launched in Singapore, in time for the 2014 fire season. Real-time bias correction and verification of this forecast will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "It has been suggested that relatively coarse resolution of atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) limits their ability to represent mid-latitude blocking. Assessing the role of model resolution for blocking is computationally expensive, as multi-decadal simulations at the desired resolution are necessary for a robust estimation of blocking statistics. Here, we use an ensemble of three atmosphere-only global models for which simulations that fulfil this requirement are available at resolutions of roughly 25km horizontal grid spacing in the mid-latitudes. This corresponds to about a fourfold increase in resolution over the highest-resolution CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 5) models. The three models are (i) the ECMWF model (IFS) as used in the project Athena, (ii) the MRI-AGCM 3.2, and (iii) our own HadGEM3-GA3 simulations obtained in the UPSCALE project (UK on PrACE - weather-resolving Simulations of Climate for globAL Environmental risk).\nWe use a two-dimensional blocking index to assess the representation of blocking in these simulations and in three reanalyses (ERA-Interim, ERA-40, MERRA). We evaluate the spatial distribution of climatological blocking frequency, the interannual variability of blocking occurrence as well as the persistence of blocking events. Furthermore, the degree to which blocking biases are associated with mean-state biases is quantified in the different models.\nWe find that the representation of blocking remains very sensitive to atmospheric resolution as the grid spacing is reduced to about 25km. The simulated blocking frequency increases with resolution, mostly so as to reduce the model bias, yet there is considerable variation between the results obtained for different models, seasons, and for the Atlantic and Pacific regions.",

            "abstract": "With new career openings in the geosciences expected and a large number of presently employed geoscientists retiring in the next decade there is a critical need for a new cadre of geoscientists to fill these positions. A project funded by the National Science Foundation titled K-12 Students, Teachers, Parents, Administrators and Higher Education Faculty: Partners Helping Rural Disadvantaged Students Stay on the Pathway to a Geoscience Career involving Wright State University and the Ripley, Lewis, Union, Huntington k-12 school district in Appalachian Ohio took led to dozens of seventh and eighth grade students traveling to Sandy Hook, New Jersey for a one week field experience to study oceanography with staff of the New Jersey Sea Grant Consortium. Teachers, parent chaperones, administrators and university faculty accompanied the students in the field. Teachers worked alongside their students in targeted professional development during the weeklong field experience. During the two academic years of the project, both middle school and high school teachers received professional development in Earth system science so that all students, not just those that were on the summer field experience could receive enhanced science learning. All ninth grade high school students were given the opportunity to take a high school/college dual credit Earth system science course. Community outreach provided widespread knowledge of the project and interest among parents to have their children participate. In addition, ninth grade students raised money themselves to fund a trip to the International Field Studies Forfar Field Station on Andros Island, Bahamas to study a tropical aquatic system. Students who before this project had never traveled outside of Ohio are currently discussing ways that they can continue on the pathway to a geoscience career by applying for internships for the summer between their junior and senior years. These are positive steps towards taking charge of their own learning and shows promise of raising parents, teachers, administrators and other k-12 students awareness of educational opportunities in the geosciences, confidence in the ability of underserved rural students to reach their educational goals and supporting them through the critical middle and high school years towards a geoscience career.",

            "abstract": "In inverse problems, investigating the relationship between data and prior models and the uncertainty related to the posterior distribution of model parameters are as important as matching the data. In recent years, many efforts have been done to assess the posterior distribution of a given problem with reasonable computational costs through inversion techniques such as McMC. The derived posterior distribution is always dependent on the prior distribution. However, most of the studies ignore modeling the prior with realistic uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a workflow to assess the uncertainty of inversion of hydraulic heads data through the addition of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) constraining data. The workflow is divided in three successive steps:\nConstruction of prior: we generate multiple alternative geological scenarios from literature data (architecture of facies) as well as site specific data (proportions of facies). Spatial uncertainty within each scenario is integrated hierarchically through geostatistics (multiple-point statistics simulation of facies constrained by ERT data as soft data).\nValidation of prior scenarios: we transform prior facies scenarios into resistivity distribution scenarios through forward and inverse modeling. The scenarios are validated by comparison with field ERT data. The comparison is made through distance calculation and projection into a low dimensional space to calculate the probability of each scenario given field ERT data.\nMatching dynamical data: we use the probability perturbation method, within each scenario, to integrate hydraulic heads to our models. We account for scenario probabilities, calculated in 2, in determining how many models per scenario we have to consider for building a reliable posterior distribution.\nAs an illustration, the method is applied on a field case study in an alluvial aquifer (Belgium) where we consider prior uncertainty related to the type of elements (gravel channels or bars) and to their size. This study shows the importance of considering the uncertainty of the prior in inverse problems as it has a strong influence on model predictions and decision-making problems.",

            "abstract": "On-line cable type Ocean Bottom Seismograph (OBS) is expected to be useful for making Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) earlier. However, careful handling of these data is required because the installation environment of OBSs may be different from that of land stations. The stability of OBS data exposed to strong shaking is one of those problems. For instance, Yamamoto et al. (2004) pointed out that the attitude of one of Off-Kushiro OBS (JAMSTEC) was changed about 5 degree by strong ground motion during the 2003 Tokachi-oki earthquake of Mjma8.0. The inclination of OBS causes baseline offset change in acceleration waveform on the gravitational acceleration component. Furthermore, it is also expected that coupling of the OBS and the ocean floor becomes weak. Since the processing of the EEW is ongoing in real-time, it is difficult to detect abnormal data appropriately. In this study, we investigate the characteristics of unusual OBS data exposed to strong motion at the Off-Kushiro OBSs. First, we estimate the amount of acceleration offset caused by rotation of the cable. The acceleration offset by slight inclination of OBS increases with input acceleration. And it is found that the acceleration offsets is larger on the horizontal component (Y’, perpendicular to the cable line) than the other horizontal component (X’, along cable line). Second, we compare the difference between the S-wave H/V spectral ratio for strong ground motion and that for weak ground motion to investigate nonlinear response. We found that S-wave H/V ratio for strong motion at OBS has typical features of nonlinear response which is similar with land stations: the dominant peak shift of lower frequency and the attenuation at high frequency. Finally, we discuss the influence of these unusual OBS data on EEW magnitude. We conclude that acceleration offsets resulting from incline of OBS could cause overestimation of magnitude.\nAcknowledgment: Strong motion acceleration waveform data of Off-Kushiro OBS were obtained from Submarine Cable Data Center, JAMSTEC.",

            "abstract": "The inner core boundary (ICB) is often considered to be permeable to flow, because solid iron could melt as it upwells across the ICB. Such a mechanism has been proposed to accompany inner core convective processes (including translation from a freezing to melting hemisphere), and has also been invoked to explain the formation of a dense Fe-rich liquid F-layer above the ICB. However, the conceptions of ICB melting invoked thus far are extremely simplistic, and neglect the many lessons learned from melting in other geological contexts. Owing to some degree of solid solution in relatively incompatible light alloys in solid iron, the onset of melting in the inner core will likely occur as a partial melt, with the liquid being enriched in these light alloys relative to the co-existing solid. Such a partial melt is then subject to upward migration/percolation out of the solid matrix owing to the buoyancy of melt relative to solid. Removal of melt and viscous compaction of the pore space results in an iron-enriched dense solid, whose negative buoyancy will oppose whatever buoyancy forces initially gave rise to upwelling. Either the negative buoyancy will balance these other forces and cause upwelling to cease, or else the solid will become so depleted in light alloys that it is unable to undergo further melting. Thus a proper accounting of partial melting results in a very different melting regime in the inner core, and suppression of upwelling across the ICB. Any fluid that is able to escape into the outer core from inner core partial melting will likely be buoyant because in order to be a melt it should be enriched in incompatiable alloys relative to whatever is freezing at the ICB. Therefore inner core melting is unlikely to contribute to the formation of an F-layer, but instead will tend to de-stabilize it. I will present models that illustrate these processes, and propose that the F-layer is a relic of incomplete mixing of the core during Earth's final stages of formation. Such models imply that the inner core may be somewhat older than models in which it crystallizes from a homogeneous outer core, although without any significant benefits for driving the geodynamo.",

To evaluate its microstructural and geochemical evolution we collected samples from the host rock to the sliding surface and adjacent deposits within landslides in Kirgizstan and central China. The sample locations represent different morphological and geological conditions to evaluate if the weakness of the sliding surface derives from general factors such as (micro)structural or mineralogical changes within the landslide body.\nBased on qualitative and quantitative geochemical analysis we could not find neither indication for notable weathering of the parent bedrock nor accumulation of clay minerals along the sliding surface to explain its reduced shear strength in the investigated near-surface landslides. The cataclasites are mainly composed of quartz, illite, calcite, kaolinite and feldspar with grain sizes between 5 μm down to < 50 nm. XRD and XRF data show no increase in Al2O3, Fe2O3 or decrease in SiO2, CaO or MgO contents towards the sliding surface, pointing to alteration processes. Transmission electron microscopy and focused ion beam technique for TEM sample preparation were used to compare the microstructures. It clearly revealed a severe reduction of grain size, and increase of pore space due to grain comminution by creeping and moving processes, indicating that elevated pore pressures are the main reason for the weakness of the sliding surfaces in shallow landslides. The comminution process within sliding surface formation seems to be comparable to fault gauge formation.",

            "abstract": "In the Kuril subduction zone, some M>7.5 earthquakes are accompanied by significant foreshock activities, providing a good opportunity to understand the characteristics of foreshocks for large interplate events such as occur along the Japan Trench and Nankai Trough etc. Some preliminary results from our examination of the foreshock sequences are as follows. Relocated foreshocks tend to migrate with time toward the trench axis. Foreshock distributions of the interplate earthquakes do not overlap with the large coseismic slips (asperities) of the mainshocks. Foreshocks of the 2007 northern Kuril outer-rise event, however, were distributed on the entire rupture area. Foreshock sequences seem to be limited in the regions where the background seismicity rates are relatively high. The foreshock activities were found in the examination of the space-time pattern of M>7 events along the northern Japan to Kuril trench since 1913 (e.g. Harada, Satake, and Ishibashi, 2011:AGU, 2012:AOGS). The large earthquakes preceded by active foreshock sequences are: the 2006 (M8.3), 2007 (M8.1) offshore Simushir earthquakes, the 1963 (M8.5), 1991 (M7.6), 1995 (M7.9) offshore Urup events, the 1978 (M7.8) offshore Iturup events, the 1969 (M8.2) offshore Shikotan event. In contrast, M>7.5 interplate earthquakes offshore Hokkaido (1952 (M8.1), 1973 (M7.8), 2003 (M8.1)) and intraslab earthquakes (1958 (M8.3), 1978 (M7.8), 1993 (M7.6), 1994 (M8.3)) had few or no foreshocks.\n In the examination of the active foreshocks, we relocated foreshocks by the Modified JHD method (Hurukawa, 1995), compared relocated foreshock areas with mainshock coseismic slip distributions estimated by the teleseismic body-wave inversion (Kikuchi and Kanamori, 2003), and examined the relation between active foreshock sequences and regional background seismicity.\n This study was supported by the MEXT’s “New disaster mitigation research project on Mega thrust earthquakes around Nankai/Ryukyu subduction zones”.",

            "abstract": "Acquisition of thermochronology data in carbonates and shales has traditionally been elusive owing to the absence of dateable minerals of suitable size for analysis. Development of such a thermochronometer is highly attractive owing to the widespread occurrence of these lithologies – including in large sections of sedimentary basins where thermal histories are relevant for hydrocarbon exploration – as well as the possibility of coupling this tool with other geochemical proxies in these units. Conodont (U-Th)/He thermochonometry has the potential to fill this niche. Conodonts are toothlike bioapatite structures common in Paleozoic through early Mesozoic marine carbonates and shales. They are well-known to the petroleum industry through use of their color alteration index (CAI) as a semi-quantitative indicator of peak temperature. Moreover, the only published conodont He study showed intriguing promise (Peppe and Reiners, 2007).\nHere we present a conodont (U-Th)/He thermochronology dataset from the Illinois Basin that displays both the potential of this tool and the outstanding questions that remain in its development. We acquired conodont He data for 7 drillcore samples of Pennsylvanian marine black shale and limestone. The conodonts have CAI values of 1-1.5, indicating maximum burial temperatures of ≤ 90 °C. First, the conodonts yield He dates substantially younger than their depositional age, indicating that the ≤ 90 °C temperatures were sufficient to cause He loss, and therefore implying that the conodont He closure temperature is no higher than the conventional apatite He system (70-80 °C). This result is compatible with conodont laboratory diffusion experiments. Second, most of our conodont dates are < 90 Ma, consistent with regional apatite He data for basement drillcore samples and suggesting that the conodonts and apatites record similar thermal histories. Finally, several samples contain dates that range from 100 to 250 Ma. The least reproducible samples are characterized by wide ranges of conodont [U] and Th/U ratios, as well as negative correlations between date and [U]. The patterns suggest that U loss generated the anomalously old conodont dates. Work is underway to ascertain whether U mobility occurred during diagenesis or was induced by the acid-based separation process.",

            "abstract": "Tropical SST anomalies are among the largest drivers of circulation regime changes on interannual time scales due to its characteristic heat capacity decay time scales. The with extreme precipitation associated circulation anomalies and the corresponding atmospheric response to SST anomalies are derived from ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis data by employing composite analysis and lagged maximum covariance analysis (MCA).  The results show that the interannual variability of extreme winter precipitation in Southeast China is in close accordance with the interannual variability of total winter precipitation. Both are associated with similar abnormal circulation regimes, but for extreme precipitation events the circulation anomalies are significantly intensified. In addition, two main moisture transport channels are captured: one extends from the North Indian Ocean through India and the Bay of Bengal to South China, and the other from the West Pacific Ocean through Maritime Continent and South China Sea towards South China, which are related to the preceding autumn SST patterns, El Niño and the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD), respectively. El Niño (La Niña) SST anomalies induce anomalous anticyclonic (cyclonic) circulation over Philippine Sea, which is favorable (unfavorable) to warm and humid air transport to South China from the tropical West Pacific by southwesterly (northeasterly) anomalies. Under these circulations, northeasterlies of East Asian Winter Monsoon are weakened (strengthened) resulting in extreme precipitation to be more (less) frequent in Southeast China. During the positive (negative) IOD phase, abundant (reduced) moisture transport to South China from tropical regions through India and Bay of Bengal is observed due to the weakened (strengthened) Walker circulations and abnormal anticyclonic (cyclonic) circulation over India, leading to a higher (lower) likelihood for extreme precipitation events in Southeast China.",

For different values of hot plasma beta, which span the observed range at Saturn, we construct a model power law expressing the relation between between magnetopause standoff distance and solar wind dynamic pressure (assumed to be equal to total magnetic plus plasma pressure at the model's outer boundary). We comment on the behaviour of the magnetospheric compressibility and scale according to: (1) The response of the magnetopause location to changes in solar wind dynamic pressure at fixed plasma beta; and (2) The response of the system which ensues when plasma beta varies at fixed solar wind dynamic pressure.",

            "abstract": "Rising bubbles may significantly affect magma mixing paths as has been demonstrated by analogue experiments in the past. Here, bubble-advection experiments are performed for the first time employing natural materials at magmatic temperatures. Cylinders of basaltic glass were placed below cylinders of rhyolite glass. Upon melting, interstitial air formed bubbles that rose into the rhyolite melt, thereby entraining tails of basaltic liquid. The formation of plume-like filaments of advected basalt within the rhyolite was characterized by microCT and subsequent high-resolution EMP analyses.\nMelt entrainment by bubble ascent appears as efficient mechanism to mingle contrasting melt compositions. MicroCT imaging shows bubbles trailing each other and trails of multiple bubbles having converged. Rheological modelling of the filaments yields viscosities of up to 2 orders of magnitude lower than for the surrounding rhyolitic liquid. Such a viscosity contrast implies that subsequent bubbles rising are likely to follow the same pathways that previously ascending bubbles have generated. Filaments formed by multiple bubbles would thus experience episodic replenishment with mafic material. Fundamental implications for the concept of bubble advection in magma mixing are thus a) an acceleration of mixing because of decreased viscous resistance for bubbles inside filaments and b) non-conventional diffusion systematics because of intermittent supply of mafic material (instead of a single pulse) inside a filament.\nInside these filaments, the mafic material was variably hybridised to andesitic through rhyolitic composition. Compositional profiles alone are ambiguous, however, to determine whether single or multiple bubbles were involved during formation of a filament. Statistical analysis, employing concentration variance as measure of homogenisation, demonstrates that also filaments appearing as single-bubble filaments are likely to have experienced multiple bubbles passing through. Whenever bubbles were essential for magma mixing, standard diffusion calculus may thus be inapplicable for constraining timescales. However, data analysis employing concentration variance allows distinguishing conventional single-pulse filaments from multiple bubble ascent advection in natural samples.",

            "abstract": "During the past decade, several magmatic intrusions and eruptions have occurred in the Red Sea region. The activity began in 2007 with an eruption on Jebel at Tair Island and it was the first volcanic event known to occur in the southern Red Sea in over a century. We used co-eruption InSAR data to constrain a tensile dislocation model, which suggests that the island’s stress field is both temporarily varying and isolated from the regional Red Sea stress regime. Later in 2009, a dike intrusion in Harrat Lunayyir (western Saudi Arabia) almost made it to the surface to start an eruption. Our InSAR observations document how the intrusion first ascended to shallow depths and then started activating graben-bounding normal faults. The progressive dike opening resulted in over a meter of crustal extension and extensive surface fracturing. During the post-diking period, the ground deformation continued, but was of an order of magnitude smaller than the displacements associated with the main event. More recently, two Surtseyan eruptions occurred in the Zubair archipelago (southern Red Sea) forming two new islands in 2011-12 and 2013. High-resolution optical imagery reveals that significant wind and coastal erosion rapidly changed both the size and the shape of the two new islands during the months following the end of the eruptions. Several TanDEM-X InSAR data sets show the co-eruption deformation that occurred on the neighboring islands, indicating that both eruptions were fed by two ~10 km long dikes with a thickness of ~1 m. All these volcanic events were fed by dike intrusions and were contemporaneously associated with significant seismic swarms. Our observations do not show evidence for shallow magma reservoirs at these locations and that the magma appears to have ascended directly from a significant depth.",

            "abstract": "Studies on Martian meteorites, as well as the analysis of data obtained during space missions, indicate the presence of basalts on the Martian surface. Analysis of their alteration features may provide insights into the climate evolution and its local variations. In this work we consider Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) as a tool to identify diagnostic alteration features on a basaltic surface.\nAFM is one of the most widely used tools for surface science and has already been introduced in space missions. Its advantages include, among others, low instrument weight and high resolution capability. It allows to observe objects in the nanoscale and analyze their topography and roughness. AFM can operate in ambient atmosphere and can be used for different, also non-conductive, materials. However, it has some significant limitations, e.g. it is not possible to determine the chemical composition directly. In order to assess the suitability of this method for analysis of basalt alteration it is necessary to complement AFM with other methods, in this case, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).\nBasalt samples from arid cold (Udokan, Siberia) and arid hot (Ogaden, Ethiopia) environments, two of the possible Martian end-member paleo-environments, have been studied. Interesting places in the samples were marked with a diamond stylus for easy identification with AFM and SEM. Mineralogical analysis based on backscattered electron spectra (BSE) was carried out in selected areas of the samples. Structures examined by AFM were assigned to specific mineral phases; it is possible to perceive details of structures that may result from weathering. The study of rocks exposed to contrasted climatic conditions (arid cold and arid hot) aims at determining effect of temperature on the formation of these features. With the used experimental approach, the same area in a given sample can be studied both by SEM and AFM. The structure of minerals identified in the BSE can be located and observed at higher resolution on AFM images, leading to interpretations at a scale that was not attainable before.",

            "abstract": "Cratonic flood basalt volcanism is the most puzzling phenomenon compared to all other types of intraplate volcanism. Cratons are thick and cold; the two parameters which suppress melting of either sublithospheric or lithospheric mantle in dry conditions. Fusible eclogites at hot plume geotherm start to melt in sublithospheric depth (~ 230 km), but geochemical arguments require that, in addition to eclogitic component, significant volume of flood basalts are from peridotitic mantle. Dry peridotitic mantle cannot be melted unless the lithospheric thickness reduced to about 60 km. That is why modern plume models incorporate lithospheric delamination and/or initially thinned lithosphere to explain cratonic flood basalts. However, if lithosphere remained thick, which was the case for the Siberian craton by the time of formation of its Devonian (Vilyui) and Permo-Triassic (Siberian) flood basalt provinces, then plume model is unable to explain the flood basalt volcanism. If mantle is wet, the peridotitic solidus lowered such as it can start to melt at sublithospheric depth (for example, 2 wt. % H2O-bearing peridotite starts to melt at ~320 km depth even at a normal mantle geotherm). In this presentation I will show that fluxing of mantle via the deep water cycle process may explain the Siberian craton flood basalts and many other continental flood basalts. According to the deep water cycle model, water is carried to the mantle transition zone by fast subducting slabs (may be in form of solid ice VII), then water is released from the slabs due to warming to the ambient mantle temperature, then localized hydration creates buoyant wet diapirs (or melt-bearing diapirs), the diapirs raise up to the sublithosheric depth were melt accumulates for the following tectonically triggered flood basalt eruptions.",

However, solute fluxes between sediments and the water column above are difficult to obtain. We determined the diapycnal nutrient fluxes across the benthic boundary layer at the OMZs off Peru and Mauritania using nutrient concentration profiles and vertical diffusion coefficients derived from 224Ra/223Ra isotope ratios.\nThe radium isotopes 223Ra (half-life: 11.4 days) and 224Ra (half-life: 3.66 days) are produced in sediments by radioactive decay of 227Th and 228Th ,respectively: Diffusion of radium out of the sediments results in gradients of 224Ra/223Ra above the sediments; and these gradients may be used to estimate vertical diffusion coefficients. We determined 224Ra/223Ra along two transects at the continental slopes off Peru (12° S) and off Mauritania (18° N) in water depths between 65m – 1000mand 53m – 1100m, respectively. For the 223Ra/224Ra sampling we used acrylic fibers/cartridges coated with MnO2. The Mn-fibers were attached to benthic landers (moored for ~ 24 hours at the sea floor) and the Mn-cartridges were placed in series on several in-situ filtration pumps (Challenger Oceanic and McLane pumps). 223Ra and 224Ra were measured on-board using a delayed coincidence counting system (RaDeCC).\nIn our presentation we will present the 224Ra/223Ra distribution along these transects investigated and we will compare the diapycnal radium-derived nutrient fluxes with those determined using benthic chambers and microstructure measurements.",

            "abstract": "The North American/Eurasian plate boundary in Iceland is structurally diverse with oblique rifts, volcanic fissure swarms, and transform zones. Lagarfljót is a lake located in the Tertiary flood basalts of East Iceland that range in age from ~7 to 3 Ma. The lake is approximately 50 km E of the actively spreading, NS-trending, Northern Rift Zone (NVZ), and occupies a northeast-trending depression in an area of strong NS lineaments. A flexure zone runs N-S across the southern part of the lake, and predates an angular unconformity in the regional lava pile. Exposures in cliffs along the lakeshore and stream cuts above unveil a series of dikes and faults that can be correlated with the lineaments, and indicate a complicated tectonic history. Fault zones are characterized by fault breccia, cataclasite and gouge with well-developed slickenlines and clear shear-sense indicators. Fault gouge in individual shear zones ranges from centimeters to meters in thickness. Cross cutting relationships define the relative ages of 2 families of structures, with both post-dating the flexure. The older generation of faults are NS-striking, dextral, strike-slip faults. These are cut by NE-striking, normal faults. The normal faults are almost exclusively located along or near the margins of large dikes or swarms of dikes ranging from 1 – 5 m wide. Displacements along individual normal faults range from centimeters up to 8 m. Some faults cut the lavas above the unconformity and locally rotated structures suggest that limited tilting of the lava pile occurred during faulting. These findings may be related to larger scale processes of propagation and relocation of the NVZ.",

            "abstract": "American River and Upper Merced basins are located on the snow-dominated area in the California’s Sierra Nevada mountain range. American River basin, located north of the Sierra Nevada, is 4,781.2 km2 and snowmelt runoff from the basin feeds the Folsom Lake reservoir which is primarily used to generate hydroelectric power as part of the Central-Valley project. To the south of the mountain range, 5,252.8 km2 Upper Merced basin is located and streamflow from the watershed is mainly used for irrigation. Because of the importance of the two basins to the state water resources, we have studied the future projected change in streamflow of the basins. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was calibrated (R2 and NSE values of 0.93 and 0.91 at American River basin and 0.86 and 0.85 at Upper Merced River basin, respectively) to simulate the hydrologic response of the basins. Monthly precipitation and temperature data from the Centre National de RecherchésMeteorologiques (CNRM) and NOAA’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) outputs were collected from World Climate Research Programme’s (WCRP) downscaled and bias corrected CMIP5 dataset. The watersheds were studied using RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 future projections for 50 year period (2015-2065). Compared to the baseline (1965-1999), peak discharge in Upper Merced basin is projected to increase by 7% to 57% at the USGS stream gauge site located upstream in the basin. At the basin outlet, peak discharge in July decreases by 15% for RCP 4.5 scenariobut increases by 30% for RCP 8.5 scenarios. Winter streamflow increases for both RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios by 50-125%. At the American River basin,there is no change in projected summer streamflow but 30-68% increase is projected in winter streamflow at the basin outlet. Overall, the high elevated mountain zones are projected to have small change compared to the lower elevated downstream zones of the basins. Based on the selected GCM outputs from the CMIP5 dataset, winter precipitation and temperature will increase in the watersheds which will cause significant change in temporal distribution of the regions’ water resource.",

The long-term changes of the typhoon intensity and occurrence frequency have been examined by many studies. On the other hand, the present study focuses on the the long-term change of the typhoon trajectories. Since the typhoon trajectory pattern may affect the risks of typhoon hazards in a particular region, its long-term change is important in planning actions to reduce the risk of typhoon hazards. We estimated the variation of a typical pattern of typhoon trajectories from the typhoon best track data by using the Gaussian process regression technique. In order to exclude the effect of a seasonal variation, a variation on a longer time scale than an annual variation was considered separately from a seasonal variation. The result indicates north-south shifts of the typhoon trajectory pattern on a 5 year or longer time scale, which is discriminable from the seasonal variation.",

            "abstract": "Carbonate minerals are an important, stable carbon sink being investigated as a strategy to sequester CO2 produced by human activity. A natural playa (Atlin, BC, CAN) that has demonstrated the ability to microbially-accelerate hydromagnesite formation was used as an experimental model. Growth of microbial mats from Atlin, in a 10 m long flow-through bioreactor catalysed hydromagnesite precipitation under ‘natural’ conditions. To enhance mineral carbonation, chrysotile from the Clinton Creek Asbestos Mine (YT, CAN) was used as a target substrate for sulphuric acid leaching, releasing as much as 94% of the magnesium into solution via chemical weathering. This magnesium-rich ‘feedstock’ was used to examine the ability of the microbialites to enhance carbonate mineral precipitation using only atmospheric CO2 as the carbon source. The phototrophic consortium catalysed the precipitation of platy hydromagnesite [Mg5(CO3)4(OH)2·4H2O] accompanied by magnesite [MgCO3], aragonite [CaCO3], and minor dypingite [Mg5(CO3)4(OH)2·5H2O]. Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy indicated that cell exteriors and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) served as nucleation sites for carbonate precipitation. In many cases, entire cyanobacteria filaments were entombed in magnesium carbonate coatings, which appeared to contain a framework of EPS. Cell coatings were composed of small crystals, which intuitively resulted from rapid crystal nucleation. Excess nutrient addition generated eutrophic conditions in the bioreactor, resulting in the growth of a pellicle that sealed the bioreactor contents from the atmosphere. The resulting anaerobic conditions induced fermentation and subsequent acid generation, which in turn caused a drop in pH to circumneutral values and a reduction in carbonate precipitation. Monitoring of the water chemistry conditions indicated that a high pH (> 9.4), and relatively high concentrations of magnesium (> 3000 ppm), compared with the natural wetland (up to 1000 ppm), and dissolved inorganic carbon (> 20 mM C) were ideal for carbonate precipitation. Under optimum nutrient and magnesium inputs, a mass balance calculation using water chemistry data and hydromagnesite as the sole mineral product resulted in a carbon sequestration rate of 61 t C/ha/year.",

            "abstract": "Ten months of data from ESA's Swarm mission, together with recent ground observatory monthly means, are used to update the CHAOS series of geomagnetic field models with a focus on time-changes of the core field. As for previous CHAOS field models quiet-time, night-side, data selection criteria are employed and the magnetic field data is used in the instrument frame with Euler angles for the rotation to the North-East-Center (NEC) frame co-estimated. The new model spans more than 15 years between 1999 and 2014, with the internal field being time-dependent up to spherical harmonic degree 20 using a 6th order spline representation with knot points spaced at 0.5 year intervals. The resulting field model is able to consistently fit data from six independent low Earth orbit satellites: Oersted, CHAMP, SAC-C and the three Swarm satellites. As an example, we present comparisons of the excellent model fit obtained to both the Swarm data and the CHAMP data. The new model also provides a good description of observatory secular variation, capturing rapid field evolution events during the past decade. Maps of the core surface field and its secular variation can already be extracted in the Swarm-era. We therefore conclude that Swarm data is suitable for building high-resolution models of the large-scale internal field, and proceed to extract IGRF-12 candidate models for the main field in epochs 2010 and 2015, as well as the predicted linear secular variarion for 2015-2020. The properties of these IGRF candidate models are briefly presented.",

            "abstract": "The Marmara and Northwestern Anatolia regions are known to be a transition zone from the strike-slip tectonics to the extensional tectonics. Although, the Sea of Marmara has been subjected to several active and passive seismic investigations, the accurate knowledge on the heterogeneity in the crust and upper mantle beneath the study area still remains enigmatic. On small-scale tomography problems, seismograms strongly reflect the effects of heterogeneities and the scattering properties of the Earth. Thus, the knowledge of high-resolution seismic imaging with an improved 3D radially anisotropic crustal model of the Northwestern Anatolia will enable better localization of earthquakes, identification of faults as well as the improvement of the seismic hazard assessment. For this purpose, 3D non-linear full waveform inversion methodology has been used to obtain an accurate image of the lithosphere and the upper-most mantle structure over an area of 37.5˚-42˚ N and 25˚-32˚ E and down to a depth of 471 km. The earthquake data were principally obtained from the Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute (KOERI) and Earthquake Research Center (AFAD-DAD) database. In addition to this, some of the seismic waveform data extracted from the Hellenic Unified Seismic Network (HUSN) stations that are located within our study region were also used in this study. We have selected and simulated the waveforms of earthquakes with magnitudes Mw ≥ 4 occurred in the period of 2007-2014. In total, 3002 three-component regional seismograms from 95 events were used. The initial 3D earth model for the study region has been implemented from the multi-scale seismic tomography study of Fichtner et al. (2013). The synthetic seismograms were computed with forward modeling of seismic wave propagation by using spectral elements method (SEM). The complete waveforms were filtered at 8-100 seconds. The adjoint method is used to compute sensitivity kernels. The differences between observed and synthetic waveforms determined using time-frequency misfits. We minimize the data misfit using the conjugate gradient approach in an iterative manner. Findings of the future work of this study are expected to illuminate the previously unresolved shallow and deep features of Northwestern Turkey with better resolution and higher accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Riparian vegetation is a key factor of the morphological evolution of river. In Europe, riparian Salicaceae is declining following the loss of potential recruitment areas associated with river management. As an exception for lowland rivers, the Loire River (France) shows, in its middle reaches, an efficient sexual regeneration of Populus nigra and Salix alba on bare sediments deposited during flood events.\nIn the literature, the influence of hydrological patterns as a key factor of the seedlings survival is well documented. Some studies focused on seedlings ability to withstand flood constraints and detailed the effect of duration and intensity of floods but few studies characterized precisely the processes applied on seedlings. As a working hypothesis, we consider that three types of flood stresses can induce mortality of seedlings: (i) uprooting by drag applied on the seedlings without sediment erosion, (ii) erosion of the recruited areas and (iii) burying. The distinction of these three processes allows identifying the importance of survival factors due to a strong sediment dynamics (e.g. erosion height > root height) or to the anchorage and resprouting ability.\nThe main issues are: what are the governing processes (type and intensity) determining survival or death of seedlings and which factor (fluvial dynamics vs. own characteristics of seedlings) controls their survival?\nIn-situ measurements were performed on a forced alluvial bar (20.000 m2) to detail the bar dynamics (bathymetry, topography, scour/fill processes, grain size surveys, flow velocity) and to survey the associated recruitment. On 48 plots (1.410 m2) the density, height and species (P. nigra and S. alba) were surveyed the year of recruitment (after dry period) and the next year after flood period.\nWe highlight the following phases of processes during floods. The erosion of substrate dominates at the beginning of the rising limb. The erosion or uprooting processes depend of the balance between available bed shear stress and sediment size. Then the deposit occurs on the back of the bar before the peak discharge and protects them against uprooting by burying during the higher energy of flow. At the end of the falling limb, sediments are reworked, decreasing the burying height of seedlings and allowing possible uprooting (drag) or erosion of sediments.",

            "abstract": "Despite a well-documented ~40% decline in summer Arctic sea ice extent since the late 1970’s, it has been difficult to estimate trends in sea ice volume because thickness observations have been spatially incomplete and temporally sporadic. While numerical models suggest that the decline in extent has been accompanied by a reduction in volume, there is considerable disagreement over the rate at which this has occurred. We present the first complete assessment of trends in northern hemisphere sea ice thickness and volume using 4 years of measurements from CryoSat-2. Between autumn 2010 and spring 2013, there was a 14% and 5% reduction in autumn and spring Arctic sea ice volume, respectively, in keeping with the long-term decline in extent. However, since then there has been a marked 41% and 9% recovery in autumn and spring sea ice volume, respectively, more than offsetting losses of the previous three years. The recovery was driven by the retention of thick ice around north Greenland and Canada during summer 2013 which, in turn, was associated with a 6% drop in the number of days on which melting occurred – climatic conditions more typical of the early 1990’s. Such a sharp increase in volume after just one cool summer indicates that the Arctic sea ice pack may be more resilient than has been previously considered.",

            "abstract": "The impacts of climate change on renewable water resources are usually assessed using hydrological models driven by downscaled climate outputs from global climate models. Most hydrological models do not have explicit parameterization of vegetation and thus are unable to assess the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on stomatal conductance and water loss of leaf. The response of vegetation to elevated atmospheric CO2 would reduce evaporation and affect runoff and renewable water resources. To date, the impacts of elevated CO2 on vegetation transpiration were not well addressed in assessment of water resources under climate change. In this study, the distributed biosphere-hydrological (DBH) model, which incorporates a simple biosphere model into a distributed hydrological scheme, was used to assess the impacts of elevated CO2 on vegetation transpiration and consequent runoff. The DBH model was driven by five General Circulation Models (GCMs) under four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). For each climate scenario, two model experiments were conducted. The atmospheric CO2 concentration in one experiment was assumed to remain at the level of 2000 and increased as described by the RCPs in the other experiment. The results showed that the elevated CO2 would result in decrease in evapotranspiration, increase in runoff, and have considerable impacts on water resources. However, CO2 induced runoff change is generally small in dry areas likely because vegetation is usually sparse in the arid area.",

At the present, both analytical and numerical models are unable to include all the possible dynamics involved into eruptions. On the other hand, the knowledge of eruption duration can be a key factor for natural hazard estimation. In this work, analyzing a large database with most of all the known volcanic eruptions, we have determined that the duration of eruptions can be described by a unique universal distribution which fully governs eruption duration dynamics. In particular, after the well-known results proposed in literature concerning the seismicity (i.e. the Gutenberg-Richter law), we present an Earth-wise power-law distribution of durations of volcanic eruptions that holds from worldwide to local scales, for different volcanic environments and for all the considered eruption types.",

The reconstruction is performed on the envelope of the received signal. The direct problem of simulating the wave-propagation inside the comet's nucleus is modelled using a wideband nonstandard finite-differences in time-domain approach and a compensation method to account for the differences in free-space path-loss due to the removal of the carrier in the simulation. This approach will yield an approximation of the permittivity distribution including features large compared to the bandwith of the sounding signal.\nIn order to account for restrictions on the measurement positions by the orbitography and limitations on the instrument dynamic range we employ a regularization technique where the permittivity distribution and the gradient with regard to the permittivity is projected in a domain defined by a viable model of the spatial material distribution. The least-squares optimization step of the reconstruction is performed in such domain on a reduced set of parameters.\nTo demonstrate the viability of the proposed approaches we provide reconstruction results based on simulation data and scale-model laboratory measurements.",

Unusual, non-specular, fast-moving meteor trail echoes are observed in the summer polar mesosphere at Kiruna, Sweden. The unusual meteor trails propagate downward and upward at speeds of a few kilometers per second along a slanted path between 87-93 km altitudes, merging in the middle and lasting for several seconds. Here we propose that an electrical discharge is responsible for these trails. The corresponding horizontal electric field for the observed speeds is estimated up to tens of volts per meter at 90 km. Both the long-lasting merging of two fast-moving plasma trails likely suggest a new type of meteor-trail leader discharge occurring in the summer polar upper mesosphere.",

            "abstract": "Tropospheric O3, an important greenhouse gas, is produced both from anthropogenic precursors and transport from the stratosphere. Previous O3 and water vapor observations in the remote tropical Pacific have shown strongly anti-correlated filaments of high O3 and reduced H2O in the mid-troposphere. These filaments were a pervasive feature seen throughout the troposphere during the CONvective TRansport of Active Species in the Tropics (CONTRAST) campaign. While it has been proposed, based on analysis of prior observations, that these filaments result from stratospheric intrusion, lack of concomitant measurement of atmospheric tracers has limited the ability to quantitatively assess the relative roles of pollution and stratospheric intrusions. In addition to O3, H2O, and CO, tracers for biomass burning, fossil fuel emissions, and the stratosphere were also measured during CONTRAST. Preliminary correlation analysis shows not only frequent anti-correlation between O3 and water vapor in the filaments but also correlation between O3 and CO as well as other anthropogenic and pyrogenic tracers. The filaments appear to be a complex mixture of air parcels from different origins. Analysis of these observations, along with results from global chemistry models and back trajectories, will be discussed, focusing on anthropogenic and stratospheric contributions to tropospheric O3.",

            "abstract": "A series of climate interruptions have been noted around the last warm period (MIS5e). Some of these are particularly conspicuous and occurred during both the deglacial as well as the glacial onset. These events are often associated with iceberg/meltwater charges into the subpolar/polar North Atlantic. A new multiproxy analysis using planktic foraminiferal abundances and SSTs, abundances of alkenone compounds and alkenone SSTs, and stable O/C isotope measurements was performed for Site 975 (Balearic Basin; Western Mediterranean). Samples covered the time from late MIS 6 to early MIS 5d with emphasis on the climate progression of the last interglacial period. A number of abrupt climate changes related to alternating influence of northern nutrient rich and southern oligotrophic water masses was revealed. Among the climate fluctuations, North Atlantic events Heinrich 11 as well as cooling events C27 – C23 could all be identified. However, in comparison to the eastern North Atlantic mid-latitude region, at Site 975 events C27 and C26 seem to be significantly more pronounced. This fact, along with evidence of a two-phase climate optimum with the SST maximum reached during its later phase, implies close similarity in climate dynamics between the Western Mediterranean and the polar Nordic Seas. It is therefore proposed that the postglacial marine development in the Nordic Seas – for instance, due to presence of winter sea ice – had a strong impact on the western Mediterranean climate via meridional atmospheric circulation patterns and temperature gradients.",

            "abstract": "Disturbance-induced tree mortality is a key factor regulating the carbon balance of a forest, but tree mortality and its subsequent effects are poorly represented processes in terrestrial ecosystem models. In particular, it is unclear whether models can robustly simulate moderate (non-catastrophic) disturbances, which tend to increase biological and structural complexity and are increasingly common in aging U.S. forests. We tested whether three forest ecosystem models—Biome-BGC, a classic big-leaf model, and the ED and ZELIG gap-oriented models—could reproduce the resilience to moderate disturbance observed in an experimentally manipulated forest (the Forest Accelerated Succession Experiment in northern Michigan, USA, in which 38% of canopy dominants were stem girdled and compared to control plots). Each model was parameterized, spun up, and disturbed following similar protocols, and run for 5 years post-disturbance. The models replicated observed declines in aboveground biomass well. Biome-BGC captured the timing and rebound of observed leaf area index (LAI), while ED and ZELIG correctly estimated the magnitude of LAI decline. None of the models fully captured the observed post-disturbance C fluxes. Biome-BGC net primary production (NPP) was correctly resilient, but for the wrong reasons, while ED and ZELIG exhibited large, unobserved drops in NPP and net ecosystem production. The biological mechanisms proposed to explain the observed rapid resilience of the C cycle are typically not incorporated by these or other models. As a result we expect that most ecosystem models, developed to simulate processes following stand-replacing disturbances, will not simulate well the gradual and less extensive tree mortality characteristic of moderate disturbances.",

            "abstract": "Life arose very rapidly on the surface of the Earth after the conditions on the early planet stabilized. The first visible record of life is now represented by the fossilized signature of microbial communities on the surface of ancient sediments. Even at this early stage, at the onset of ecology, it is clear that the development of biofilms at the sediment-water interface would have affected the response of the surface to erosive force. The close interaction between biology and physical dynamics started early. The stabilization of the sediment will have been important in promoting the development of biogeochemical gradients, and promoting the niche segregation that drives evolution. As these microbial mat systems evolved is likely that their binding capacity changed as form and function developed. The onset of photosynthesis was a step change in this process. Studies on the biodynamics of modern Bahamian stromatolites demonstrated the importance of photosynthesis in promoting the biogenic stabilization of the carbonate (ooid) sediments by microbial assemblages derived from living stromatolites. The present study presents a comparative assessment of this work using new material from living stromatolitic assemblages from Shark Bay, Australia. Samples of stromatolites were taken and the natural microbial assemblages extracted and characterized. Microbial assemblages were incubated on the surface of clean sediment and the relative stabilization of the surface measured using the cohesive strength meter system to determine surface stability against time. Magnetic particle induction was also used to determine the relative adhesive capacity of the surfaces as assemblages developed. The results are presented and examined in contrast to the previous work on the biodynamics of modern Bahamian stromatolitic systems showing significant variation in form and function between the two different stromatolitic assemblages. The reasons for this variation are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Paleolimnological records from southwest Greenland reveal that diatom communities have not changed in a similar way to other regions of the Arctic, and in general, do not show synchronous change across this area. There are a number of cases in which lakes in close proximity to each other show opposite community changes over the Holocene. These changes in diatom fossil profiles have been difficult to interpret due to a lack of explicit ecological information for key species. The objective of this project is to decipher the ecology of key diatom species that are abundant across these paleolimnological records. We hypothesize that climate-driven changes in nutrients and water column stability (via its effects on light availability) are key factors shaping diatom community structure in these lakes. We assessed the requirements of particular taxa for nutrients and light through comparative lake sampling and resource bioassays. A whole-lake manipulation in which water column stability was reduced through enhanced water circulation was also conducted to assess the response of key taxa to this change. We found that the relative abundances of key diatom taxa are under complex control by the interactive effects of nutrients and light. We discuss how these results will enhance interpretation of climate-induced changes in Arctic lakes in this region.",

            "abstract": "South Asia has one of the world’s highest aerosol loading due to the dramatic increase of anthropogenic emissions from the 1950s associated with rapid urbanization and population growth. The possible large-scale impact of the late 20th century increase of South Asian aerosol emissions on climate away from the source regions was studied by means of historical ensemble experiments with a state-of-the-art coupled climate model with fully interactive aerosols and a representation of both direct and indirect aerosol effects. The key characteristics of the northern hemisphere responses are examined separately for winter and summer, and show that regional aerosols induce significant planetary-scale teleconnection patterns. In both seasons, the large-scale aerosol imprint originates from substantial changes in the regional precipitation distribution. During the winter, in response to anomalous surface cooling in the northern Indian Ocean, aerosols cause a westward shift of convection over the eastern Indian Ocean and compensating subsidence to the west and over the Maritime continent. During the summer, aerosols are collocated with rainfall, and cause a widespread drying over South Asia mostly by indirect effects. In both cases, the impact of the regional diabatic heating anomaly propagates remotely by exciting a northern hemisphere wave-train which, enhanced by regional feedbacks, leads to remarkable changes in near-surface climate, including circulation and temperature, over Eurasia, the northern Pacific and North America. Depending on the region, the induced anomalies may have opposite signs between the two seasons, and may thus contribute to reinforcing or dampening those due greenhouse gases. These results underscore the potential influence of Asian aerosols on global climate, which is a compelling problem as regional aerosol loading will continue to be large in the coming decades.",

This is achieved by performing a sounding of the comet’s core between the lander \"Philae\" located on the comet’s surface and the orbiter \"Rosetta\".\nFor these measurements a stable synchronization between lander and orbiter has to be ensured. This has to be done with the direct propagation path between orbiter and lander as close as possible to the point of occultation.\nThe point of occultation can be estimated with the Rosetta link budget simulator. The simulator uses the radiation pattern for orbiter and lander calculated with an integral-equation based numerical solver. The orbiter pattern is calculated in free-space and the lander pattern considers the bulk material of the comet represented by an infinite half-space, which enables the investigation of mutual coupling effects. The underground can be modeled with arbitrary values for the relative permittivity and the conductivity in order to investigate the influence on the received signal at the orbiter.\nFor the synchronization scenario the losses due to free-space path-loss, different complex permittivity values and the polarization mismatch are considered, especially the latter has a major influence on the received power. Thereby the latest possible point for synchronization can be estimated dependent on the antenna alignment between orbiter and lander.\nMoreover a statistical analysis of the received power can be performed in order to investigate the impact of the antenna misalignment for a normal distributed and arbitrarily chosen angular deviation between orbiter and lander.",

With limited data available, earlier inner core studies defined each boundary using one line of longitude, but this may not be a sufficient description for what could be one of the inner core's most heterogeneous regions.\nHere, I present a large, hand-picked dataset of PKPbc-PKPdf differential travel times which sample the inner core under Africa, where the proposed position of one hemisphere boundary is located. The dataset contains polar, intermediate and equatorial rays through the inner core, and the presence of crossing raypaths makes regional-scale tomography of the inner core feasible.

In this study, we analyzed radiolarian fossils for seven drilled sites of IODP Exp. 346 from the Japan, Yamato and Ulleung (JYU) basins in a marginal sea of the mid-latitude NW Pacific. Significant variations of the well-preserved fossil assemblage imply that the unique oceanic circulation changes in the basins through Mid-Miocene to Pleistocene might be controlled by global climatic changes and topographic changes with local/regional tectonics.\nWarm water radiolarians Dictyocoryne spp. and Tetrapyle spp. characterized in the Tsushima Current water occurred commonly since 1.7 Ma suggesting a beginning of the warm water inflow from the southern strait of the basins. It might be coincident with an opening of the Okinawa Trough in the East China Sea. On the other hand, during the Pliocene period, sporadic occurrence of the warm water species was recognized in southern part of the examined area. This implies that a minor influence of the warm water was present in the southern coastal area of the Yamato Basin.\nTypical deep dwelling species such as Cornutella profunda and Peripyramis circumtexta is absent in the present JYU basins, however they occurred frequently during Pliocene and Miocene. This suggests the deep-water exchange between the JYU basins and the North Pacific via the deeper strait, which might be present in the northern part of the sea. These deep-water radiolarians disappeared from the JYU basins at the early Pleistocene (~2.7 Ma to 1.7 Ma), which is almost coincident with the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation.",

However, mounting evidence indicates the existence of autochthonous brGDGTs in marine environments，which may affect MAAT reconstruction and the use of other related paleoenvironmental proxies. Here we provide high resolution profiles of brGDGTs in a sedimentary core (MD05-2896/7) from the southern South China Sea, which include MBT and CBT indices as well as the branched and isoprenoid tetraether (BIT) index. The BIT results varied systematically with glacial-interglacial cycles, with values distinctly lower (<0.1) during the interglacial periods (MIS 1 and MIS 5) than during the glacial periods (MIS 2, MIS, 3, MIS 4 and MIS 6). Also distinct is the MBT/CBT-derived temperature, which show lower values during the interglacial periods but higher values during the glacial periods. We hypothesize that the lower MBT/CBT-derived temperature during the interglacial periods reflects subsurface water column temperature registered by autochthonous brGDGTs produced in situ marine conditions, whereas the higher MBT/CBT derived-temperature during the glacial periods reflects terrestrial MAAT because of the overwhelming input of brGDGTs from land when sea level was low. Similarly, the CBT-derived pH appears to have been overprinted also by the sea water signal of the interglacials but affected mostly by precipitation during the glacial intervals, showing patterns similar to or as a positive response to the southern hemispheric climate oscillation due to teleconnection. Our study demonstrates the complexity of brGDGT occurrence in marine environments and suggests that the MBT/CBT proxy should not be directly employed for the reconstruction of terrestrial MAAT at marine settings when BIT value is lower than 0.1.",

Two bands near 331 and 539 cm-1 are observed clearly at 1.1 GPa. In the cubic garnet structure, the lower frequency peak can be assigned to a mode of A1g + F2g symmetry and the higher frequency peak can be assigned to a mode with A1g + Eg + F2g symmetry. The band at 331 cm-1 in the A1g + F2g mode is assigned to O4H4-translational and librational motion and the band at 539 cm-1 in the A1g + Eg + F2g mode is assigned to OH-translational motion. The peak positions and shapes in the Raman spectra agree well with those measured under ambient conditions. With increasing pressure, the frequency of the F2g mode increases continuously with pressure derivative of 10 cm-1/GPa. Upon increasing pressure, the A1g + Eg + F2g modes split at 5 GPa and the intensity of the this Raman band gradually decrease due to the cubic-tetragonal phase transition. The most striking characteristic of the Raman spectrum of katoite is that compression leads to the extinction of the Raman-active mode derived from A1g + Eg + F2g symmetry.",

Our results are based on analysis of a ca. 6 m long marine gravity core taken from 398.2 meters water depth on the southwestern Greenland shelf, just offshore Nuuk, Greenland. Selected samples of the sediment core were analyzed for benthic foraminifera, dinoflagellate cysts, and geochemistry. Based on radiocarbon dates on mollusk remains from several depths in the core, the record spans the time period from approx. 12.5 cal kya BP up to the present day. This core is well located in the pathway of the WGC, just before the divergence point where the current either continues northward along Western Greenland or splits off to the west, crossing the Davis Strait. The strength of the SPG is strongly tied to the phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Preliminary analysis of benthic foraminifera suggests that the WGC had a strong Atlantic (Irminger Current) component, in addition to entrained Arctic Water from the East Greenland Current. This project is intended to determine the relative contributions of these currents to the WGC as well as the strength of the subpolar gyre throughout the Holocene.",

            "abstract": "Several gem quality diamond deposits are found in paleo-alluvial deposits across Borneo. The source of the diamonds and their origin are enigmatic. They could have formed in Borneo and be derived from local sources, or they could be related to diamond deposits in NW Australia, and carried with the Southwest Borneo Block after it rifted from Australia in the Late Jurassic.\nWe collected U-Pb isotopic data from detrital zircons from the Cempaka alluvial diamond deposit in southeast Borneo. Two thirds of the zircons that were dated crystallized between 75 Ma and 110 Ma. The other third are Triassic or older (223 Ma, 314-319 Ma, 353-367 Ma, 402-414 Ma, 474 Ma, 521 Ma, 549 Ma, 1135-1176 Ma, 1535 Ma, 2716 Ma). All of the Cretaceous zircons are angular, euhedral grains with minor evidence of mechanical abrasion. Considering their age and morphology they were likely derived from the nearby Schwaner Granites. The Triassic and older grains are rounded to semi-rounded and were likely derived from Australia before Borneo rifted from Gondwana. Some of the zircons have ages that resemble those of the Merlin and Argyle diamond deposits of Australia.\nThe diamonds themselves have delicate resorption features and overgrowths that would potentially be destroyed with prolonged transport. Geochemical data collected from the diamonds implies they were associated with lamproite intrusions.\nDeep seismic lines and zircons from igneous rocks suggest SE Borneo, the East Java Sea and East Java are largely underlain by thick lithosphere rifted from NW Australia. Based on several lines of evidence, we propose that diamond-bearing lamproites intruded before rifting of SW Borneo from Australia, or after collision with Sundaland of SW Borneo and the East Java-West Sulawesi Blocks during the Cretaceous. Exposure of the source after the Late Cretaceous led to diamond accumulation in river systems that flowed from the Schwaner Mountains.",

            "abstract": "Seismicity is a key tool used for monitoring fracturing and faulting in around volcanoes, with a particular emphasis placed on the frequency (Long period or Low Frequency, LF events) thought to be due to fluid movement, as compared to Volcano-Tectonic activity driven by pure fracture. To better understand these fundamental processes this research presents new rock deformation experiments designed to simulate shallow volcano-tectonic pressure/temperature conditions, linking pore fluid flow to the induced seismicity. A particular emphasis is placed on the conditions of pressure and temperature required to stimulate LF activity. Our setup imposes a rapid pore pressure release or “venting” via a small pre-drilled axial conduit to stimulate rapid fluid movement through an established fracture damage zone via a two stage process. Firstly experiments are conducted to generate a through-going shear fracture, with pore fluid connectivity to this fracture enhanced via the axial conduit. The shear failure is imaged via AE location with ~mm scale accuracy. The second stage vents pore fluid pressure via an electrical solenoid valve.\nWe find that this second stage is accompanied by a swarm of LF activity akin to Long Period (LP) activity on active volcanoes. We find that a significant change in the dominant frequency of LF events is recorded as pore fluid pressure decrease through, and beyond, the water boiling point and the transition between LF and VLF occurred at the pressure at which the superheated water turn to vapour. In addition, we observe a significant dependence of the recorded LF upon the fluid flow rate. Finally, we present new data using low frequency (200 kHz) AE sensors, in conjunction with our standard 1 MHz-central-frequency sensors, which permit us to better constraint LF and VLF events with lower attenuation, and hence an improved characterization of these LF seismic signals. Data are used to forecast the final time of failure via the fracture forecast methods of Kilburn (2004), showing a good correlation between measured sample failure time and the forecast time based on AE event rate. Our data showed little change in forecast accuracy when using LF data compared to regular HF data, illustrating the importance of newly fracturing surfaces in the application of such models.",

            "abstract": "Using the 53 MHz very high frequency radar at the Indian tropical station of Gadanki (13.5N, 79.2E), the characteristics of high frequency (period of oscillation of few minutes to few tens of minutes) internal atmospheric gravity waves generated from convection as well as strong wind shears are studied in detail in the heights of 1.5 km to 20 km. Along with that detailed studies are also carried out about the vertical propagation characteristics of low frequency gravity waves (period of oscillation of few hours) passing through strong wind shears and the tropopause. Normally three causative mechanisms are suggested for the generation of gravity waves from convection: (1) latent heating of the atmosphere, (2) oscillation updrafts and downdrafts and (3) air flows crossing deep convective clouds. In the present work, we have taken one convection event (occurred for a few hours during night time on 06 June 2011) as a case study and found from the analyses of the horizontal and vertical winds measured by the MST radar that gravity waves were generated by both the mechanisms of latent heating and mechanical oscillator effects. The dominant periods of oscillation observed are ~13 min., ~17 min. and ~26 min. It is found that these frequencies satisfied well the dispersion relations associated with non-hydrostatic high frequency gravity waves. It is concluded that all the three mentioned mechanisms play significant role in determining the vertical propagation of gravity waves.\nIn an another event during 23-25 January 2012, it is found that gravity waves with periodicity of ~7 hours, generated in the lower troposphere, propagates to higher heights of lower stratosphere without hindered by strong wind shears and tropopause conditions existed in between. However, high frequency gravity waves (periodicity of few tens of minutes) generated from strong wind shears near the tropopause propagate only a few kms in height both below and above the shear region.",

            "abstract": "The avulsion or abandonment of a river channel in favor of a new course on the floodplain is integral to the development and maintenance of anabranching planforms. Avulsions tend to occur on rivers where the rate of vertical aggradation outpaces lateral migration. In fine cohesive floodplain sediments, avulsions evolve through five stages dependent on the amount of flow and sediment being captured by the new channel. There is limited data available to allow the prediction of autogenic and allogenic controls on: the time over which an avulsion is active; its likely location; the frequency of occurrence; and the length of the interavulsion period. The delivery of wood to the river channel is an autogenic process which has received much attention over the last three decades. Surprisingly it has not previously been considered in anabranch avulsions, apart from where log-jams entirely block channels. The presence of large woody debris in the channel acts as a roughness element, trapping, and impeding the movement of sediments and deflecting flow onto the floodplain. We hypothesize that the delivery rates of wood to the channel, and its subsequent configuration (i.e. dimension, amount, volume, spatial arrangement and blockage ratio), alters flow and sediment routing through the channel. These changes directly influence the stages of avulsion development. To test this conceptual model we have used eleven floodplain cores to reconstruct the timing of a Holocene avulsion. The morphology of the channel in each evolutionary stage was used to estimate the relative role of wood as a roughness element. This was done by coupling a mass balance wood delivery model, run in a Monte Carlo simulation, to the geomorphic processes of each evolutionary stage of the avulsion. Our results allow us to quantify the importance of in-channel wood during each stage of the avulsion. These data highlight that there are critical points in the evolution of anabranching channels when large wood influences the avulsion rate and location.",

            "abstract": "A ground based sky imaging system was developed at the Manila Observatory in 2012 to measure cloud occurrence and to analyse seasonal variation of cloud cover over Metro Manila. Ground-based cloud occurrence measurements provide more reliable results compared to satellite observations. Also, cloud occurrence data aid in the analysis of radiation budget in the atmosphere. In this study, a GoPro Hero 2 with almost 180o field of view is employed to take pictures of the atmosphere. These pictures are taken continuously, having a temporal resolution of 1min. Atmospheric images from April 2012 to June 2013 (excluding the months of September, October, and November 2012) were processed to determine cloud cover. Cloud cover in an image is measured as the ratio of the number of pixels with clouds present in them to the total number of pixels. The cloud cover values were then averaged over each month to know its monthly and seasonal variation. In Metro Manila, the dry season occurs in the months of November to May of the next year, while the wet season occurs in the months of June to October of the same year. Fig 1 shows the measured monthly variation of cloud cover. No data was collected during the months of September (wherein the camera was used for the 7SEAS field campaign), October, and November 2012 (due to maintenance and repairs). Results show that there is high cloud cover during the wet season months (80% on average) while there is low cloud cover during the dry season months (62% on average). The lowest average cloud cover for a wet season month occurred in June 2012 (73%) while the highest average cloud cover for a wet season month occurred in June 2013 (86%). The variations in cloud cover average in this season is relatively smaller compared to that of the dry season wherein the lowest average cloud cover in a month was during April 2012 (38%) while the highest average cloud cover in a month was during January 2013 (77%); minimum and maximum averages being 39% apart. During the wet season, the cloud occurrence is mainly due to tropical storms, Southwest Monsoon, and local convection processes. In the dry season, less cloud is formed because of cold dry air from Northeast Monsoon (December to February) and generally dry and hot weather (March to May). Regular data collection has been implemented for further long term data analysis.",

            "abstract": "In the recent time the fresh water resource becomes very important because of various reasons like population growth, pollution, over exploitation of the ground water resources etc. As there is no efficient and proper measures for recharging ground water exists and also the climatological impacts on water resources like global warming exacerbating water shortages, growing populations and rising demand for freshwater in agriculture, industry, and energy production. There is a need and challenging task for analyzing the future changes in regional water availability and it is also very much necessary to asses and predict the fresh water present in a lake or reservoir to make better decision making in the optimal usage of surface water.\nIn the present study is intended to provide a practical discussion of methodology that deals with how to asses and predict amount of surface water available in the future using Remote Sensing(RS) data , Geographical Information System(GIS) techniques, and GCM (Global Circulation Model). Basically the study emphasized over one of the biggest reservoir i.e. the Krishna Raja Sagara (KRS) reservoir situated in the state of Karnataka in India. Multispectral satellite images like IRS LISS III and Landsat L8 from different open source web portals like NRSC-Bhuvan and NASA Earth Explorer respectively are used for the present analysis. The multispectral satellite images are used to identify the temporal changes of the water quantity in the reservoir for the period 2000 to 2014. Also the water volume are being calculated using Advances Space born Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Global DEM over the reservoir basin. The hydro meteorological parameters are also studied using multi-source observed data and the empirical water budget models for the reservoir in terms of rainfall, temperature, run off, water inflow and outflow etc. are being developed and analyzed. Statistical analysis are also carried out to quantify the relation between reservoir water volume and the hydrological parameters (Figure 1).\nA general circulation model (GCM) is used for the prediction of major hydro meteorological parameters like rainfall and using the GCM predictions the water availability in terms of water volume in future are simulated using the empirical water budget model.",

            "abstract": "State-of-the-art climate models now include more climate processes simulated at higher spatial resolution than ever. Nevertheless, some processes, such as atmospheric chemical feedbacks, are still computationally expensive and are often ignored in long climate simulations. We use the recently developed atmosphere-ocean chemistry-climate model AO-UMUKCA (HadGEM3) to show that the choice of how to represent stratospheric ozone in climate models lacking interactive chemistry can have a first order impact on estimates of effective climate sensitivity. We find an about 1°C (~20%) larger global mean surface warming after 75 years when ozone is prescribed at pre-industrial levels compared with when it is allowed to evolve self-consistently in response to an abrupt 4xCO2 forcing. This difference is primarily attributed to changes in longwave radiative feedbacks associated with circulation-driven decreases in tropical lower stratospheric ozone and related stratospheric water vapour and cirrus cloud changes. This has important implications for global model intercomparison studies in which participating models often use highly simplified treatments of atmospheric composition changes and, in particular, for abrupt 4xCO2 experiments where this feedback is often ignored.",

            "abstract": "Triassic bedded cherts from the Jurassic accretionary complexes in Japan consist of centimeter scale alternations of chert and shale beds. Previous studies have proposed that the rhythmical alternations of Triassic chert and shale beds represent astronomical cycles. Although cyclostratigraphy of the Triassic bedded chert sequence was identified in the Inuyama area of the Mino Belt, central Japan, the validity of its cyclostratigraphy requires detailed cyclostratigraphic correlations to other Triassic bedded chert sequences in Japan. In this study, we performed cyclostratigraphic analysises to the Middle Triassic (Anisian–Ladinian) bedded chert sequence in the Tsukumi area of the Chichibu Belt, southwest Japan. The average duration of a chert–shale couplet in the Middle Triassic bedded chert of the Tsukumi area is ~10 kyr. This duration is inconsistent with the ~20 kyr duration of the precession cycle during the Triassic, which was confirmed by estimated average duration of a chert-shale couplet in the Triassic bedded chert of the Inuyama area. The dominat cycles in a bed number series of thickness variations in the Middle Triassic chert beds show approximately 2–5, 10, 40, 200, 300 and 400 beds cycles. Given that the average duration of one chert–shale couplet is 10 kyr, these cycles correspond to approximately 20–50, 100, 400, 2000, 3000 and 4000 kyr periodicities. The periodicities of the Tsukumi chert are consistent with those of the Inuyama chert (approximately 40–60, 100, 140, 240, 400 and 4000 kyr). Previous paleomagnetic studies have revealed that the Middle Triassic bedded cherts in the Tsukumi area were deposited in the equatorial region (2.1°±5.2°S), whereas the deposition of the Inuyama cherts occur at relatively higher latitude (16.9°±10.2°N). If the interpretation that rhythmical alternations of chert and shale beds are paced by precession and eccentricity cycles is valid, the average duration of a chet–shale couplet from the Tsukumi area might reflect the semi–precession cycle (~10 kyr) in the equator area caused by biannual passage of the Sun. Further cyclostratigraphic analysises will requires to estimate the paleolatitudinally dependent patterns in the cyclicities of the Triassic bedded chert sequences in Japan.",

            "abstract": "The intense inner radiation belt at Jupiter (>50 MeV at 1.5 RJ) is generally accepted to be created by radial diffusion of electrons from further away from the planet. However, this requires a source with energies that exceed 1 MeV outside the orbit of the moon Io at 5.9 RJ, which has never been explained satisfactorily. Here we test the hypothesis that this source population could be formed from a very soft energy spectrum, by particle injection processes and resonant electron acceleration via whistler mode chorus waves. Using the first simulations at Jupiter combining wave particle interactions and radial diffusion, we calculate the change in the electron flux between 6.5 and 15 RJ with the BAS Radiation Belt Model starting from a very soft spectrum. The resulting electron flux at 100 keV and 1 MeV lies very close to the Galileo Interim Radiation Electron model spectrum after 1 and 10 days respectively. The primary driver for the increase in the flux is cyclotron resonant acceleration by chorus waves. A peak in phase space density forms such that inside L≈9 radial diffusion transports electrons towards Jupiter, but outside L≈9 radial diffusion acts away from the planet. The results are insensitive to the softness of the initial energy spectrum but do depend on the value of the flux at the minimum energy boundary. We conclude by suggesting that the source population for the inner radiation belt at Jupiter could indeed be formed by wave-particle interactions.",

            "abstract": "Understanding how turbulence behaves and is dissipated at kinetic scales in the solar wind is a topic of current interest that remains to be well understood. It has long been known that there is a break in the spectrum of magnetic fluctuations at ion kinetic scales, although the exact scale associated with this break, and therefore its cause, is currently debated, with several recent observational results that have arrived at different conclusions. In particular, it is difficult to distinguish between the ion gyroscale and ion inertial length at 1 AU, since the ion beta β is typically order unity. Here, we take a different approach, and examine many intervals of extremely high and low β, which occur rarely, but with the long dataset of the Wind spacecraft, can be found. The break is seen to occur at the ion gyroradius for β>>1 and the inertial length for β<<1, i.e., whichever is larger. Possible explanations for these results are discussed, including Alfven wave dispersion, damping and current sheets.",

            "abstract": "Antarctic ice cores represent an invaluable source for understanding the climate of the past. Climatically important gases, including CO2, can be extracted from the ice and measured, thus providing atmospheric records for the past 800 kyr. Research has shown that atmospheric CO2 has varied naturally in conjunction with Antarctic air temperature. Additional knowledge of the variations of the stable carbon isotope of CO2, δ13Catm, can help us better understand the processes involved in these fluctuations. Here, we present a complete δ13Catm record extending from 160 kyrBP to the present. The present record, measured primarily on ice from the EPICA Dome C and Talos Dome ice cores, demonstrates a complex interplay of the ocean, terrestrial biosphere and atmosphere carbon reservoirs. For instance, a long-term increasing trend in δ13Catm, starting at the penultimate glacial maximum, extends well into MIS 4, while CO2 shows major drops already between 115 kyrBP and the MIS 5/4 boundary. In contrast, δ13Catm evolved roughly in antiphase during the MIS 4/3 transition with the atmospheric carbon storage increasing by 50 Gt while δ13Catm decreased by 0.5‰, a signal larger than that observed during the last glacial/interglacial termination. This antiphase relationship suggests that a single natural process or multiple processes acting on similar timescales may be responsible for this change in CO2. Modelling studies have shown that the ocean has the greatest impact on the concentration and stable isotope abundance of this greenhouse gas, in particular due to changes in stratification, upwelling, or marine productivity in the Southern Ocean. Similar to the situation at the onset of the last glacial/interglacial termination (Schmitt et al., 2012), the MIS 4/3 transition is characterized by the occurrence of a Heinrich event in the North Atlantic, presumably related to changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and the upwelling of old carbon enriched waters in the Southern Ocean, which may explain the antiphase relationship of CO2 and δ13Catm at that time.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have shown how human induced N:P imbalances are affecting essential processes (e.g. photosynthesis, plant growth rate) that lead to important changes in ecosystem structure and function. In this regard, the accuracy of the approaches based on remotely-sensed data for monitoring and modeling gross primary production (GPP) relies on the ability of vegetation indices (VIs) to track the dynamics of vegetation physiological and biophysical properties/variables. Promising results have been recently obtained when Chlorophyll-sensitive VIs and Chlorophyll fluorescence are combined with structural indices in the framework of the Monteith’s light use efficiency (LUE) model. However, further ground-based experiments are required to validate LUE model performances, and their capability to be generalized under different nutrient availability conditions.\nIn this study, the overall objective was to investigate the sensitivity of VIs to track short- and long-term GPP variations in a Mediterranean grassland under different N and P fertilization treatments. Spectral VIs were acquired manually using high resolution spectrometers (HR4000, OceanOptics, USA) along a phenological cycle. The VIs examined included photochemical reflectance index (PRI), MERIS terrestrial-chlorophyll index (MTCI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence calculated at the oxygen absorption band O2-A (F760) using spectral fitting methods was also used. Simultaneously, measurements of GPP and environmental variables were conducted using a transient-state canopy chamber.\nOverall, GPP, F760 and VIs showed a clear seasonal time-trend in all treatments, which was driven by the phenological development of the grassland. Results showed significant differences (p<0.05) in midday GPP values between N and without N addition plots, in particular at the peak of the growing season during the flowering stage and at the end of the season during senescence. While NDVI did not show any significant difference between treatments, VIs sensitive to pigment variations and physiology (PRI, MTCI) and F760 behaved as GPP. Model performance test indicated that VIs related to physiology and fluorescence are key to account for nutrient availability in LUE models and to better predict GPP.",

            "abstract": "Existing as a strong and steady high pressure system at the top of the troposphere, the South Asia High (SAH) has a significant impact on the weather - climate of the northern hemisphere. However, how the SAH affects the climate of the southern hemisphere remains unclear. In order to find out how atmospheric circulation of the Southern Hemisphere changes in response to the SAH，a numerical simulation model, Community Earth System Model (CESM) , and a set of 40-year \nreanalyzed data were used. As the SAH is sustained by the surface heating of the Tibetan Plateau (TP), the SAH is weakened with a lower TP. Therefore, two experiments were designed with the altitude of TP set to 50% and 100% of the modern height respectively. The simulation results show that when the SAH is stronger with the modern TP, the subtropical highs over the southern hemisphere and the TP-southern Indian Ocean circulation appear to strengthen. The result from the 40-year ECMWF\n reanalyzed data analysis shows that the SAH have a significant positive correlation with subtropical highs over the southern hemisphere. It is concluded that with the condition of a stronger SAH, the atmospheric circulation over southern hemisphere strengthens significantly. As a consequence, this climatic change may lead to Antarctica warming and the drying of the southern hemisphere.\nKeywords: South Asia High; CESM; Climate change; Subtropical high",

            "abstract": "Mantle dynamics drives the rifting of the continents and consequent crustal processes shape the topography of the rifted margins. Surface processes modify the topography by eroding positive reliefs and sedimenting on the basins. This lateral displacement of masses implies a change in the loads during rifting, affecting the architecture of the resulting margins. Furthermore, thermal insulation due to sediments could potentially have an impact on the rheologies, which are proved to be one of the most influential parameters that control the deformation style at the continental margins. In order to understand the feedback between these processes we have developed a numerical geodynamic model based on MILAMIN. Our model consists of a 2D Lagrangian triangular mesh for which velocities, displacements, pressures and temperatures are calculated each time step. The model is visco-elastic and includes a free-surface stabilization algorithm, strain weakening and an erosion/sedimentation algorithm. Sediment loads and temperatures on the sediments are taken into account when solving velocities and temperatures for the whole model. Although surface processes are strongly three-dimensional, we have chosen to study a 2D section parallel to the extension as a first approach. Results show that where sedimentation occurs strain further localizes. This is due to the extra load of the sediments exerting a gravitational force over the topography. We also observed angular unconformities on the sediments due to the rotation of crustal blocks associated with normal faults. In order to illustrate the feedbacks between surface and inner processes we will show a series of models calculated with different rheologies and extension velocities, with and without erosion/sedimentation. We will then discuss to which extent thermal insulation due to sedimentation and increased stresses due to sediment loading affect the geometry and distribution of faulting, the rheology of the lower crust and consequently margin architecture.",

            "abstract": "The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite provides radiometric measurements for automated fire detection. The baseline VIIRS Active Fire Product (AFP) is very similar to the collection 4 legacy fire detection algorithm developed for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument on NASA’s Terra and Aqua spacecraft and is expected to become operational and validated in the Fall of 2014. VIIRS (imagery and the AFP) will soon be incorporated into NESDIS’ operational Hazard Mapping System (HMS) fire and smoke analysis. The HMS incorporates a wide variety of satellite data for use in fire detection, including GOES-East and GOES-West at least every 15 minutes, five NOAA and METOP polar orbiting satellites with the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument and MODIS Aqua/Terra. The HMS utilizes the automated fire detections from each of the sensors which are then quality controlled by an analyst. The VIIRS AFP became available for evaluation with the HMS in the Spring of 2014. The AFP was compared with the final quality controlled HMS product over the contiguous US between 8 April and 8 June 2014, which is primarily the agricultural and prescribed fire season, in order to determine the number of VIIRS unique fires. In making the comparison, any VIIRS AFP fire that was within 4 km of an HMS fire would not be considered unique, due to navigational accuracy and the 4km nominal resolution of GOES. Any VIIRS fire that was within 2km of a power plant or a known false detect location was also not considered. Based on these criteria there were 5876 VIIRS AFP unique locations compared to 71,705 HMS detections, approximately 8 percent of the HMS total. These extra locations potentially represent additional emissions that could affect air quality. The geographic distribution resembled the burning pattern during this period with the majority over the Southeast and from the Northern Plains to the Gulf Coast, with a peak cluster over the Flint Hills of eastern Kansas. Additional comparisons for the 2014 Summer and Fall wildfire seasons will be conducted and presented.",

Here, we exploit the USArray waveform data to examine one of\nthese sharp transitions beneath Alaska. From west to east beneath Alaska, we observed three\ndifferent type of D”: West region with strong Scd requiring sharp δVS = 2% increase;\nMiddle region with no clear Scd indicating lack of D”; East region with strong Scd requiring gradient\nδVS increase. To explain such strong lateral variation, chemical variations must be involved. We\nsuggested that West region represents a normal mantle. In contrast, the east region is dominated by\nsubducted slab. At the Middle region, we discovered a strong upwelling structure that disrupts the phase\nboundary. A distinct pattern of travel time delays, waveform distortions, and amplitude patterns\nreveal a circular anomaly about 5° across which can be modeled synthetically as a dome about\n400 km high with a shear velocity reduction of ~5%.

The total abundance of formation gases in drilling mud was low. Methane, helium, hydrogen and carbon dioxide were detected in drilling mud when the drill hole encountered gas-rich strata, reaching maximum concentration of 55 ppmv He, 1400 ppmv of CH4, 400 ppmv of hydrogen and 1.1 vol-% of CO2. We therefore consider the INFLUINS borehole to be relatively dry. The drilling mud gas composition is linked with the drilled strata: Buntsandstein and Muschelkalk show different formation gas composition and are therefore hydraulically separated. The correlation between hydrogen and helium and the high relative helium abundance rules out any artificial origin of hydrogen and suggest a radiolytic origin. Ratios CH4/(C2H6/C3H8) <50 imply that hydrocarbons derive from thermal degradation of organic matter. Carbon isotope studies are ongoing to clarify origin and provenance of hydrocarbons. Abundances of all noble gases and isotope ratios of He, Ne and Ar were determined on five samples. While Ne and Ar isotope ratios for all samples are indistinguishable from air, 3He/4He ratios are always lower than air, revealing the presence of a deep helium source in all samples. Two samples from shallower depth yield air-corrected 3He/4He ratios ≤0.03 Ra typical for radiogenic helium production in the crust. For two samples from greater depth, slightly higher air-corrected 3He/4He ratios of 0.188 ± 0.076 Ra and 0.220 ± 0.058 Ra, respectively, were observed, indicating small contributions of non-radiogenic helium.",

            "abstract": "To promote the transition towards a low carbon economy, the Scottish Government has adopted ambitious energy targets, including generating all electricity from renewable sources by 2020. To achieve this, continued investment will be required across a range of sustainable technologies.\nHydropower has a long history in Scotland and the present-day operational capacity of ~1.5 GW makes a substantial contribution to the national energy budget. In addition, there remains potential for ~500 MW of further development, mostly in the form of small to medium size run-of-river schemes.\nClimate change is expected to lead to an intensification of the global hydrological cycle, leading to changes in both the magnitude and seasonality of river flows. There may also be indirect effects, such as changing land use, enhanced evapotranspiration rates and an increased demand for irrigation, all of which could affect the water available for energy generation.\nPreliminary assessments of hydropower commonly use flow duration curves (FDCs) to estimate the power generation potential at proposed new sites. In this study, we use spatially distributed modelling to generate daily and monthly FDCs for a range of Scottish catchments using a variety of future land use and climate change scenarios. These are then used to assess Scotland’s future hydropower potential under different flow regimes.\nThe results are spatially variable and include large uncertainties, but some consistent patterns emerge. Many locations are predicted to experience enhanced seasonality, with lower power generation potential in the summer months and greater potential during the autumn and winter. Some sites may require infrastructural changes in order to continue operating at optimum efficiency.\nWe discuss the implications and limitations of our results, and highlight design and adaptation options for maximising the resilience of hydropower installations under changing future flow patterns.",

            "abstract": "It has been considered that transport properties of the mantle (ex. electrical conductivity, viscosity, seismic attenuation) changes dramatically during ascend of the mantle especially at around the mantle solidus. To understand the mechanism of such changes, we measured the electrical conductivity and viscosity of the lherzorite analogues during slow increases and decreases in temperature reproducing the mantle crossing its solidus.\nTwo types of samples, one was forsterite plus 20% diopside and the other was 50% forsterite, 40% enstatite and 10% diopside with addition of 0.5% spinel, were synthesized from Mg(OH)2, SiO2, CaCO3 and MgAl2O4 (spinel) powders with particle size of <50 nm. Samples were expected to exhibit different manners in initiation of partial melt and amount of melt during the temperature change. We continuously measured electrical conductivity of these samples at every temperature during gradual temperature change, which crosses the sample solidus (~1380℃ and 1230℃ for forsterite + diopside sample and spinel-added samples, respectively). Sample viscosity were also measured under constant loads of 0.5~50 MPa.\nThe electrical conductivity and viscosity at well below (>150℃) the sample solidus exhibited linear distributions in their Arrhenius plots indicating that a single mechanism controls for each transport property within the experimental temperature ranges. Such linear relationship especially in the electrical conductivity was no longer observed at higher temperature regime exhibiting its exponential increase until the temperature reached the sample solidus. Such dramatic change with changing temperature has not been detected for the sample viscosity. Monotonic increase of electrical conductivity in accordance with increasing melt fraction was observed above the sample solidus.",

            "abstract": "While there have been notable advances in deriving river characteristics such as width, using satellite remote sensing datasets, deriving river bathymetry remains a significant challenge. Bathymetry is fundamental to hydrodynamic modelling of river systems and being able to estimate this parameter remotely would be of great benefit, especially when attempting to model hard to access areas where the collection of field data is difficult. One such region is the Congo Basin, where due to past political instability and large scale there are few studies that characterise river bathymetry. In this study we test whether it is possible to use passive optical remote sensing to estimate the depth of the Congo River using Landsat 8 imagery in the region around Malebo Pool, located just upstream of the Kinshasa gauging station.\nMethods of estimating bathymetry using remotely sensed datasets have been used extensively for coastal regions and now more recently have been demonstrated as feasible for optically shallow rivers. Previous river bathymetry studies have focused on shallow rivers and have generally used aerial imagery with a finer spatial resolution than Landsat. While the Congo River has relatively low suspended sediment concentration values the application of passive bathymetry estimation to a river of this scale has not been attempted before.\nThree different analysis methods are tested in this study: 1) a single band algorithm; 2) a log ratio method; and 3) a linear transform method. All three methods require depth data for calibration and in this study area bathymetry measurements are available for three cross-sections resulting in approximately 300 in-situ measurements of depth, which are used in the calibration and validation.\nThe performance of each method is assessed, allowing the feasibility of passive depth measurement in the Congo River to be determined. Considering the scarcity of in-situ bathymetry measurements on the Congo River, even an approximate estimate of depths from these methods will be of considerable value in its hydraulic characterisation.",

            "abstract": "Nucleation or new particle formation in the atmosphere accounts for almost half of the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) across the globe and in doing so plays a significant role in modulating the Earth’s energy balance. Experiments performed in the CERN CLOUD chamber show substantial nucleation caused by oxidation products of monoterpene emitted by vegetation. Here we show the significance of nucleation involving biogenic organic compounds in producing atmospheric particles and estimate the impact on climate. Firstly the results show that in the present-day atmosphere organic-only nucleation is highly suppressed in most parts of the world, but makes a major contribution to particle concentrations when sulphuric acid participates in the nucleation process. But organic nucleation mechanisms are likely to play a more significant role in the pre-industrial atmosphere than the present, making it an important factor to be considered when estimating the first indirect forcing of climate due to anthropogenic aerosols from pre-industrial to the present day. Previous studies have concluded that biogenic emissions are not a major factor in controlling modelled CCN number concentrations when compared to other larger model uncertainties. This study will also show to what extent the modelled CCN number concentration, and in turn the estimated first indirect forcing, is sensitive to this improved understanding of the role of biogenic organics in particle formation, in addition to the role they have been known to play in particle growth.",

            "abstract": "Biosphere-atmosphere exchanges of carbon dioxide are an important component of the global carbon cycle, and understanding current exchanges is crucial for predicting future uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide. Agricultural systems in the Midwestern United States cover a large area and have the potential to influence the future carbon budget of the United States. Biosphere-atmosphere exchanges of carbon dioxide are typically measured at the ecosystem level using the eddy covariance technique that covers a relatively small spatial area. Top-down approaches using a global network of carbon dioxide concentration measurements provide relatively coarse spatial information. High altitude balloons (HABs) are an inexpensive platform for sounding the vertical structure and composition of the atmosphere that can bridge the spatial gap between these two other techniques. The HAB platform will also complement new satellite measurements of carbon dioxide from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2. In the first-generation approach of the HAB technique, a single balloon is launched, and a vertical profile of carbon dioxide is recorded during the balloon’s ascent. The balloon bursts between 11 and 14 km altitude, and a second profile of carbon dioxide is obtained during the descent. The difference in carbon dioxide concentration is computed as a function of altitude, which is converted to a molar difference by accounting for the temperature and pressure profile of the atmosphere, and then a flux is obtained by summing the molar differences and dividing by the time difference between ascent and descent. The second-generation approach uses two balloons and compares their ascent profiles. This is an improvement, since the balloon can travel 100 km due to the strength of the jet stream, making it difficult to compare ascent and descent profiles. The technique works best on days with a well-developed convective boundary layer. During peak growing season, uptake rates of -30 to -50 μmol m-2 s-1 are observed, while positive values are obtained at the beginning of the growing season and during a severe drought.",

            "abstract": "Eldgjá is a ~75 km volcanic fissure which erupted in the middle of the 10th century. It belongs to the Katla volcanic system and is of the mixed-cone row type. The eruption lasted several years and produced two large lava fields (18.3 km3) and a widespread basaltic tephra deposit (4.5 km3 or 1.3 km3 DRE). Proximal tephra deposits are up to 5 m thick and contain as many as 10 sub-units which vary in thickness parallel to the fissure, indicating multiple points of origin. Many of the lowest units were produced by phreatomagmatic activity and dispersion of these units indicate an origin below the Mýrdalsjökull glacier.\nTwo sections were chosen to represent magmatic and phreatomagmatic activity. A 3.7 m section at Skælingar, 0.5 km south-east of Eldgjá, represents the magmatic products. The phreatomagmatic products are represented by a 2.7 m thick section at Stóragil, located 10-15 km south and east of the vent system. The sampled phreatomagmatic part of the section is 1.12 m thick. These sections were logged and then each sub-unit was sampled for density analysis which involves picking 100 clasts in the 8 to 32 mm size range from horizons less than 5 cm thick. Thin-sections were then made from representative clasts of each sub-unit. Nested images of these thin-sections were analysed for vesicle size and shape. The magmatic clasts have unimodal, normal to moderately log-normal density distributions with a mean density of 7900-7500 kg.m-3 (60-70% vesicularity) and a range of around 8600 kg.m-3 (40% vesicularity). The log-normal distribution of some samples may be explained by the inclusion of previously degassed magma in the eruption. The section at Stóragil contains both phreatomagmatic and magmatic products. The phreatomagmatic samples have characteristic plateau-like distributions with a mean density of 7200-7500 kg.m-3 (70-80% vesicularity) and a range of around 8420 kg.m-3 (45% vesicularity). One layer shows a change from phreatomagmatic to magmatic vesicularity distributions. Initial results for vesicle size analysis indicate simple nucleation patterns, vesicle number densities per volume (NV) in the order of 4×103 mm-3 and vesicle number densities per melt volume (NVM) in the order of 1 4×104 mm-3 The complete set of vesicle size analysis results will be presented at the conference.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic field measurements obtained by the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft in orbit around Mercury have entered a new phase since April 2014, with periapsis altitudes below 200 km. MESSENGER is now obtaining magnetic profiles across large impact features at altitudes less than the horizontal scale of those features. We use data from this latest phase to investigate evidence for remanent crustal magnetization specifically associated with impact basins and large craters. The spatial resolution of magnetic field measurements for investigating crustal magnetization is approximately equal to the altitude of the observations. We focus on large impact features because their relative ages provide a powerful chronological tool for interpreting any associated magnetic signatures. We examine profiles across large impact basins such as Caloris, Shakespeare, Budh-Sobkou and Goethe. For example, coverage over Caloris during the last year of the mission will be largely at night and will comprise 18 profiles with altitudes between 125 and 200 km and 12 profiles with altitudes between 50 and 125 km over the northern part of the basin. We use large-scale magnetospheric models developed with MESSENGER data to remove contributions from the offset axial dipole, magnetopause, and magnetotail. The residual magnetic fields above 200 km are still dominated by poorly understood magnetospheric fields such as those from the cusp and from Birkeland currents. We empirically average, or exclude observations from these local times, in order to search for repeatable internal field signals. We use local basis functions such as equivalent source dipoles, applied with regularization tools, in order to map the altitude-normalized magnetic field from internal sources. These internal sources may comprise both crustal and core contributions, and we use the information from the along-track magnetic gradient in order to separate these contributions.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic currently experiences an unprecedented warming. This dynamic response to changes in climate forcing as well as corresponding feedbacks as sea ice retreat make the Arctic a key region to study past and future climate changes. Recent Arctic-wide temperature reconstructions indicate a long-term cooling prior to the ongoing warming. However, they are based mostly on proxies that record summer information and hence are assumed to be seasonally biased towards the summer. Moreover, the Russian Arctic is significantly underrepresented in these Arctic-wide reconstructions.\nHere we present glacier and ground ice records from Northern Siberia that provide valuable information for a better spatial and seasonal understanding of Holocene climate variability in the Arctic.\nThe high-resolution Akademii Nauk δ18O ice core record (Severnaya Zemlya) proves the Late Holocene cooling and the pronounced warming after 1800. It shows neither a prominent Medieval Climate Anomaly nor a Little Ice Age but gives evidence of several abrupt warming and cooling events during the last centuries, also found in ice-core records from Svalbard and Franz Josef Land. They may be related to the regional internal climate variability, i.e. atmosphere-sea ice feedbacks in the Barents and Kara seas region.\nIce wedges were studied at several study sites in the Lena River Delta and the coastal permafrost lowlands of the Laptev Sea region. They are formed by the repeated filling of wintertime thermal contraction cracks by snow melt water in spring. Radiocarbon dating of organic matter enables the generation of centennial scale δ18O records that are indicative of temperatures in the cold period of the year (winter and spring).\nOur ice wedge records show general increasing δ18O trends over the Mid and Late Holocene and an unprecedented recent warming. Both may be related to the changes in orbital forcing during the cold season as well as in greenhouse gas concentrations over the last millennia. However, this pattern is in contradiction to most other Arctic temperature records that, in turn, are likely summer-biased. Our ice-wedge records add therefore unique and substantial climate information for understanding the seasonal patterns of Holocene climate in the Arctic and might help to bridging the gap between proxy records and climate models in the Arctic.",

            "abstract": "Nearby earthquakes and slow slip could potentially trigger each other. This correlation, however, has not been clearly quantified. Previous studies of the triggering between nearby earthquakes and slow slip (as delineated by tremor) are mostly based on a single slow slip event or big earthquake, and have been quantified only for stresses from distant earthquakes and tides.\nWe investigate 12-year earthquake and tremor catalogs for Southwest Japan, and find that local intraslab earthquakes (M1-4) are weakly correlated with subsequent tremor. Earthquakes bigger than M2 tend to be followed by tremor more than expected at random; smaller earthquakes show less triggering. The number of correlated tremor before earthquakes is not as significant, although there are marginally more than expected.\nTo understand the possible underlying mechanisms for triggering of tremor from earthquakes, we evaluate both the static and the dynamic stress changes associated with the earthquakes. The triggering mechanism is most likely to be the dynamic rather than the much smaller static stress changes. We find that dynamic shear stress changes of several tens of kPa due to incoming S-waves from nearby earthquakes increase the tremor rate by a factor of about 2 to 5. This rate is similar to although perhaps a factor of a few lower than rates of tremor triggering observed for similar stress changes by the much lower-frequency teleseismic surface waves and tides, suggesting that the duration of an applied stress perturbation affects triggering efficiency much less than the amplitude affects it.",

            "abstract": "In 2014, Sao Paulo city had its largest water shortage in history. By the end of the first half of 2014, the Cantareira system of water reservoirs, which is responsible for supplying fresh water for about 9 million people in the city, dried to less than 10% of its active storage, leading to a critical situation and the need to pump water from its dead storage and allocate water from other smaller systems of reservoirs in order to meet the demand of the city and avoid a mandatory water rationing. Understanding and identifying the leading factors for such a water crisis is critical for the security of the city. Here, we investigate historical data of water levels and inflows into the Cantareira system and of the rainfall series over the contributing basin in order to estimate the contribution of climate factors to the variability of the water storage levels at the Cantareira system and shed some light on the main causes of the current water shortage. Preliminary results based on natural inflow data from 1930 to 2014 and water storage levels from 2004 through 2014 reveal that, about 60% of the low frequency (beyond seasonal cycle) variance in the storage level trends is explained by trends in the inflows. A remarkably monotonic decreasing trend of about 1.5% per month in the storage levels is observed since 2010 and is closely associated with a similar decreasing trend in the inflows into the system for the period. In fact, the annual average inflow for 2012 (25.6 m3/s) and 2013 (25.7 m3/s) was 65% of the long term average and still below the 2004-2012 average withdrawal to supply Sao Paulo (26.64 m3/s). By the end of the 2013 rainy season the system had accumulated 63% of its total capacity, but the persistence of low inflows and high temperatures during 2013 did not allowed any increase in the water levels. In 2014 austral summer the system experienced the worst hydrological drought since 1930 based on the available streamflow records. The average inflow for the 2014 rainy season (DJFM) is the lowest value (14.5 m3/s) ever recorded for the season, with an empirical exceedance probability of 98.8%. Analysis of meteorological droughts and climate teleconnections in the region as well as of opportunities and implications of inflow and rainfall forecasts for 2015 from different modeling sources for water management in Sao Paulo are also discussed along this work.",

In this geomorphological position, landslides were investigated in the middle of the Lower Vistula Valley – major polish river valley (53°14’N 18°14E). In the zone between Fordon and Kozielec landslides develop within Quaternary tills, sands and clays with glacitectonic deformation. Determination of contemporary activity of landslides in the escarpment zone is based on field work, such as a detailed inventory and documentation of the landslide forms, geotechnical and geological drillings, geodesic measurements, and analysis of aerial photographs. Shearing slides, often in the multiple rotational form, are the most common type of landslides. Most landslides are developed within the main scarps of old landslides. The size of contemporary landslides ranges from 500m2 to 70000m2. While the old, inactive landslides’ area varied between 120000m2 to 300000m2. Contemporary active forms represents 58%, regularly active for 17%, and inactive for 25% of the identified landslides. Depending on geomorphological zones, landslides cover up to 30% of the area of the slopes. Currently, in the study area precipitation and geological settings are the most important factor of landslide activation.

            "abstract": "During the DYNAMO field campaign, a vertically pointing NOAA W-band (94 GHz) radar was mounted on the R/V Revelle to sample a wide range of clouds from shallow warm clouds to high cirrus clouds. The Doppler velocity spectra often contained multiple peak structures. In warm clouds, multiple peaks were due to cloud droplets and drizzle droplets in the same radar pulse volume. And in rainfall beneath well-defined reflectivity dim-bands near the melting layer, the multiple peaks were due to Mie scattering signatures from raindrops larger than 1.6 mm.\nThis presentation will describe a method of identifying multiple peaks in Doppler spectra and then determining if the multiple peaks were due to cloud and drizzle droplets or due to large raindrops exciting a Mie scattering signature. In both cases, the multiple peak structure provides a signature to estimate vertical air motion. For spectra containing cloud droplets, the symmetric peak is a tracer used to estimate the air motion. For spectra with asymmetric shapes and large downward Doppler velocities, the Mie scattering notch is used to estimate the air motion. Examples of the retrieval procedure will be provided at the conference.",

            "abstract": "Intermittently Closed/Open Coastal Lakes/Lagoons (ICOLLs) are a form of wave-dominated, microtidal estuary that experience periodic closure in times of low river flow. ICOLL entrance morphodynamics are complex due to the interaction between wave, tidal and fluvial processes. Managers invest substantial funds to artificially open ICOLLs as they flood surrounding property and infrastructure, and have poor water quality. Existing studies examine broad scale processes but do not identify the main drivers of entrance condition. In this research, the changes in entrance geomorphology were surveyed before and after artificial entrance openings in three ICOLLs in Victoria, Australia. Changes in morphology were related to continuous measures of sediment volume, water level, tide and wave energy. A six-stage quantitative phase model of entrance geomorphology and hydrodynamics is presented to illustrate the spatio-temporal variability in ICOLL entrance morphodynamics. Phases include: breakout; channel expansion with rapid outflow; open with tidal exchange; initial berm rebuilding with tidal attenuation; partial berm recovery with rising water levels; closed with perched water levels. Entrance breakout initiates incision of a pilot channel to the ocean, whereby basin water levels then decline and channel expansion as the headcut migrates landwards. Peak outflow velocities of 5 m/s-3 were recorded and channel dimensions increased over 6 hrs to 3.5 m deep and 140 m wide. When tidal, a clear semi-diurnal signal is superimposed upon an otherwise stable water level. Deep-water wave energy was transferred 1.8 km upstream of the rivermouth with bores present in the basin. Berm rebuilding occurred by littoral drift and cross-shore transport once outflow ceased and microscale bedform features, particularly antidunes, contributed to sediment progradation. Phase duration is dependant on how high the estuary was perched above mean sea level, tidal prism extent, and onshore sediment supply. High offshore wave height and frequency, in addition to littoral drift magnitude, were main drivers of closure. This study presents a predictive model of entrance morphodynamics whereby managers can determine proximity to natural closure or opening, and as a result identify whether implementing an artificial opening is worthwhile.",

            "abstract": "Past climates provide an out-of-sample test of the climate models used for future climate projections. We evaluate palaeosimulations of the Last Glacial Maximum (21,000 years before present) and Mid-Holocene (6000 years before present) from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), focusing on features that are also present in simulations of the response to raised CO2. Several features of the simulations are common to both past and future simulations, including the ratio of land-sea temperature contrast, high-latitude amplification of temperature changes, winter amplification of temperature responses to year-round forcing, precipitation scaling with temperature, and differential precipitation/temperature scaling over land and ocean. The mechanisms giving rise to these phenomena are similar in past and future climates. Comparison with palaeoclimatic reconstructions show these features are simulated realistically in the past, and presumably therefore in the future simulations. There are also parallels in the regional response to changes in forcing in the past and future simulations, including changes in monsoon strength and in mid-continental climates. Comparison with palaeo-reconstructions shows the models capture the sign of such changes correctly but predict the magnitude poorly, and thus future projections are also likely to underestimate the strength of regional responses. LGM climates have been used to constrain estimates of climate sensitivity, on the assumption that the model that best reproduces reconstructed LGM climates is likely to have the most realistic climate sensitivity. However, global biases in simulated LGM temperature are only weakly related to climate sensitivity. Furthermore, ocean temperature biases are globally low and land temperatures globally high compared with reconstructions. The current generation of climate models includes improvements in resolution, complexity and parameterizations and produce better simulations of modern climate but evaluations show there has been no improvement in the simulation of past climates. Since past forcing and climate changes are of comparable magnitude to those expected in the 21st century, this emphasizes the need to focus on further improving the simulation of regional climate changes.",

            "abstract": "Agricultural systems will only be sustainable if social and economic considerations are included in their design. Systems of Rice Intensification (SRI) has been proposed as more sustainable form of rice production due to reported higher yields and lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However there is a research gap concerning the wider social and economic implications of SRI.\nWe developed a model to simultaneously analyse social, economic and environmental sustainability indicators (GHG emissions, ground water use, fossil/ non-fossil energy use, costs, profits, gender, employment quality and employment quantity) to compare SRI to conventional flooded rice production systems. Data was based on farmer-recall questionnaires in Andhra Pradesh, India. Data was collected per hectare and per kg of paddy.\nSRI substantially increased yields (157% of control), reduced ground-water requirements (64% ha-1, 42% kg-1, of control) and reduced GHG emissions (72% ha-1, 42% kg-1, of control). Costs were substantially lower for SRI systems, on both a hectare and a per kg basis. The high yields and lower costs resulted in a doubling of profits per hectare.\nHowever, these benefits are accrued to the farmer potentially at the expense of landless labourers. The role of agricultural employment in developing countries is a controversial issue, but in India, whose substantial economic growth has been largely jobless, agriculture retains a key role in reducing under- and un- employment.\nSRI labour demand was lower (70% of control ha-1). Simultaneously the ratio of male to female employment increased, from 67% female labour in control to 50% SRI.\nThus trade-offs may exist between environmental, economic and social aspects of SRI. Understanding sustainability from a broad perspective facilitates better policy creation.",

            "abstract": "Current Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) augmentation systems attempt to consider all possible ionospheric events in their correction computations of worst-case errors. This conservatism can be mitigated by subdividing anomalous conditions and using different values of ionospheric threat-model bounds for each class. A new concept of ‘real-time ionospheric threat adaptation’ that adjusts the threat model in real time instead of always using the same ‘worst-case’ model was introduced in my previous research. The concept utilizes predicted values of space weather indices for determining the corresponding threat model based on the pre-defined worst-case threat as a function of space weather indices.\nSince space weather prediction is not reliable due to prediction errors, prediction errors are needed to be bounded to the required level of integrity of the system being supported. The previous research performed prediction error bounding using disturbance, storm time (Dst) index. The distribution of Dst prediction error over the 15-year data was bounded by applying ‘inflated-probability density function (pdf) Gaussian bounding’. Since the error distribution has thick and non-Gaussian tails, investigation on statistical distributions which properly describe heavy tails with less conservatism is required for the system performance. This paper suggests two potential approaches for improving space weather prediction error bounding. First, we suggest using different statistical models when fit the error distribution, such as the Laplacian distribution which has fat tails, and the folded Gaussian cumulative distribution function (cdf) distribution. Second approach is to bound the error distribution by segregating data based on the overall level of solar activity. Bounding errors using only solar minimum period data will have less uncertainty and it may allow the use of ‘solar cycle prediction’ provided by NASA when implementing to real-time threat adaptation. Lastly, we perform evaluation of the Ground-Based Augmentation System (GBAS) availability using adaptive ionospheric threat model by applying improved bounded prediction errors. This study would improve availability and reliability of GNSS augmentation systems against the uncertainty of space weather prediction.",

Heat flow is supposed to be an indicator for the varying depth of the magma chamber beneath the ridge axis. Bottom observations from previous work on the SWIR are scarce and visual information about geostructures, habitat landscapes, benthic faunal communities and their distribution in this area have so far been missing.\nVigorous fluid flow in the form of black smokers or shimmering water could not be detected but enhanced heat flow due to upward pore water migration occurred. This leads to values of very high heat flow (up to 850 mW/m2) and advection rates up to 25 cm/a Darcy velocity. Enhanced biomass and a greater variation of megafauna along those sites of high heat flow could be inferred from reconnaissance observations with a camera sledge. A closer investigation of microbial activity in the material of gravity corers revealed favorable living conditions for microorganisms.\nWe find the inorganic carbon fixation rates, here applied like a proxy of microbial metabolic activity, were significantly higher (up to 7 times higher) in surficial sediments in proximity of the station PS 81/640 compared to other stations along the ridge. Conversely the extracellular enzymatic activities did not show any significant difference in the potential organic matter degradation between the stations investigated. These results suggest an increase of chemosynthetic activities at St PS 81/649, possibly related to increase of availability of reduced compounds (i.e. sulphide, reduced metals) in presence of pore water flow.",

            "abstract": "Bubble nucleation in melts occurs preferentially on the surfaces of crystals. Of all phases in oxidized melts, magnetite is most favorable for the heterogeneous nucleation of bubbles owing to the high wetting angles at the bubble-crystal-melt interface. Preservation of such relationships in erupted rocks however, is rare owing to overprinting by decompression-induced degassing, shear and bubble detachment during magma ascent. We present evidence from basaltic enclaves preserved in andesite lavas from Soufriere Hills Volcano, Montserrat, for a spatial association between magnetite and bubbles that we propose is a relict of the bubble nucleation process at depth. The existence of bubble-crystal aggregates means that magnetite crystals will tend to sink more slowly, and bubbles will rise less fast than for the case of single crystals and bubbles. The behavior of bubble-crystal aggregates will be dependent on their bulk density, which depends on the relative proportion by mass of the magnetite and the bubble and the pressure. In deeper chambers, the smaller mass of exsolved volatiles leads to the prediction that many of the bubble-crystal aggregates are dense and so fall to base of the chamber (and the bubbles are wholly or partially resorbed). In shallower chambers, however, the larger volume and mass of exsolved volatiles would tend to promote buoyant aggregate formation. The presence of the aggregates has implications for the mixing/mingling process when mafic magmas underplate crystal-rich evolved magma bodies in the arc crust. For shallow magma chambers the buoyancy of the aggregates in the underplating mafic magma will either cause vapor accumulation at the magma interface and the formation of mafic inclusions rich in magnetite; or the enhanced density of the aggregates may promote magma chamber overturn and mixing of mafic magmas into the andesites bodies. Both processes may be important over different spatial and time-scales. The overturn mechanism may explain the hybrid features of the andesite, including the presence of cryptic mafic components, reverse zoning of phenocrysts and how volatiles might be sourced from the mafic magmas and distributed within andesite bodies.",

            "abstract": "Wave and tide dominated sandy beach ecosystems have a major effect on coastal carbon, nutrient, and trace element cycling. The coarse-grained sediments are characterized by a high permeability, which permits advective porewater transport. Due to the fast porewater flow in the sandy sediment, organic matter remineralization products (i.e. nutrients and trace metals) are only slightly enriched in the porewater and rapidly discharged to the coastal zone where they can potentially stimulate primary production.\nHere we present stable silicon isotope (δ30Si) data from groundwaters and porewaters from Spiekeroog Island, a barrier island in the southern North Sea, Germany. Groundwater was sampled in the freshwater lens down to 70 m depth in the center of the island. The beach porewaters were taken along a transect from the dune belt to the low water line at depths between 0.5 and 5.2 m. This transect represents the mixing zone of fresh and saline groundwater with seawater, whereby the terrestrial driven groundwater flow provides a potential source of terrestrially derived Si isotope compositions resulting in a modification of the marine-dominated porewater composition.\nThe groundwater is characterized by high Si concentrations of up to 750 µM and rather low δ30Si signatures between +0.6‰ and +1.2‰, which decrease with depth (and age) within the freshwater lens. The porewaters have much lower Si concentrations around 50-60 µM and higher and more variable δ30Si between +1.0‰ and +2.5‰. The lower δ30Si values are found closer to the dunes and at greater depths in the beach sediments. These signatures possibly reflect the outflow of the fresh groundwater to the coastal zone. The higher values represent the influence of seawater, which delivers water with a high δ30Si signature previously enriched by phytoplankton growth.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is fundamental to advancing our knowledge of energy and mass transport in the solar system, thus also rendering it crucial to space weather and its prediction. The advent of truly wide-angle heliospheric imaging has revolutionised the study of CMEs, by enabling their direct and continuous observation as they propagate from the Sun out to 1 AU and beyond. The recently initiated EU-funded FP7 Heliospheric Cataloguing, Analysis and Technique Service (HELCATS) project combines European expertise in the field of heliospheric imaging, built up over the last decade in particular through lead involvement in NASA’s STEREO mission, with expertise in such areas as solar and coronal imaging as well as the interpretation of in-situ and radio diagnostic measurements of solar wind phenomena.\nThe goals of HELCATS include the cataloguing of CMEs observed in the heliosphere by the Heliospheric Imager (HI) instruments on the STEREO spacecraft, since their launch in late October 2006 to date, an interval that covers much of the historically weak solar cycle 24. Included in the catalogue will be estimates of the kinematic properties of the imaged CMEs, based on a variety of established, and some more speculative, modelling approaches (geometrical, forward, inverse, magneto-hydrodynamic); these kinematic properties will be verified through comparison with solar disc and coronal imaging observations, as well as through comparison with radio diagnostic and in-situ measurements made at multiple points throughout the heliosphere. We will provide an overview of the HELCATS project, and present initial results that will seek to illuminate the unusual nature of solar cycle 24.",

            "abstract": "Substantial uncertainties still exist in the quantification of the surface energy balance, and its representation in climate models. While the radiative exchanges at the top of atmosphere are now well known from satellite programs, the energy distribution at the Earth surface is less well determined. To better constrain the magnitudes of the surface radiative components we make extensive use of surface observations to constrain the radiation balance not only from space, but also from the surface. We combine these observations with the latest generation of climate models (CMIP5) to infer best estimates for the global, land and ocean mean surface radiative components. We determine the global mean downward surface solar and thermal radiation near 185 and 342 Wm-2, respectively, to be most compatible with surface observations. Combined with an estimated global mean surface absorbed solar radiation and thermal emission of 161 Wm-2 and 398 Wm-2, this leaves 105 Wm-2 of surface net radiation globally available for distribution amongst the non-radiative surface energy balance components. Over land, where most direct observations are available to constrain the surface fluxes , we obtain 185 and 305 Wm-2 for solar and thermal downward radiation, respectively. Over oceans, with weaker observational constraints, corresponding estimates are around 185 and 356 Wm-2. Considering additionally surface albedo and emission, we infer an absorbed solar and net thermal radiation of 137 and -67 Wm-2 over land, and of 170 and -53 Wm-2 over oceans. The surface net radiation thus amounts to around 70 Wm-2 over land and 117 Wm-2 over oceans, which may impose additional constraints on the respective sensible and latent heat fluxes.\nWe discuss further aspects of decadal changes in these fluxes, based on updated surface observations from the BSRN network, as well as their representation in CMIP5 models.\nRelated references:\nWild 2012: New Directions: A facelift for the picture of the global energy balance.

            "abstract": "River terraces are commonly distributed within the Central Range in Taiwan. Most of them are poorly preserved due to possibly the high rates of erosion and are not well geologically dated. The Hsinwulu River flows through the eastern flank of the southern Taiwan Central Range and its river terraces are well preserved in comparison with other parts of the Central Range. The river terraces may well record the recent tectonic uplift history of the most tectonically active region in Taiwan. Along the more than 20 km long river, there are three major groups of river terraces: the Hsinwu, Wulu and Lidau terrace groups. Field observations indicate that the river terraces are composed of both river sediments and debris flow deposits with unknown geologic ages. We mapped all the river terraces and some strath exposures along the river and projected them onto the longitudinal river profile. We estimated the ages of the strath exposures by plotting ages vs a range of possible incision rates, constrained by the vertical heights between the strath exposures to the river basement rocks. To further and independently evaluate the ages for the river terraces, we applied recent continuous GPS data along the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Hsinwulu River showing vertical displacements of 3.6, 8.0 and 9.1 mm/yr, respectively. Our results indicate that these terraces are much older than previously thought. The terraces range possibly from 20,000 to 60,000 years and their formation likely relates to the curve of sea level change during the period in addition to the tectonic uplift resulted from the plate convergence between the Eurasian and Philippine Sea plates.",

            "abstract": "Dust on snow can have regionally important climatic and hydrologic impacts resulting from direct reduction of surface albedo and indirectly from the initiation of snow albedo feedbacks. Modeling the radiative impacts of dust deposited in snow requires knowledge of the optical properties of both components. Here we present an inversion technique to retrieve the effective optical properties of dust deposited in mountain snow cover from measurements of hemispherical dust reflectance and particle size distributions using radiative transfer modeling. First, modeled reflectance is produced from single scattering properties modeled with Mie theory for a specified grain size distribution over a range of values for the imaginary part of the complex refractive index (k=-0.00001 to -0.1). Then, a multi-step look-up table process is employed to retrieve the imaginary part of the complex index of refraction and single scattering optical properties by matching measured to modeled reflectance between 0.35 and 2.5 µm at 10 nm resolution. The real part of the complex refractive index for dust aerosols ranges between 1.5 and 1.6 and a sensitivity analysis shows the method is relatively insensitive to the choice of n within this range, 1.525 was used here. Using the values retrieved by this method to update dust optical properties in a snow+aerosol radiative transfer model reduces errors in spring time albedo modeling by 50% to 70%, matching measured albedo to within 2% on average in the visible wavelengths and 5% over the full range of snow reflectance.",

            "abstract": "Estimation of carbon fluxes of small forest stands is needed in order to adequately assess the effect of variable stand conditions and of different management strategies. Such estimations may not be possible using micrometeorological methods such as the eddy covariance technique (EC), as large areas are required with homogeneous land use, management and species composition. Earlier findings show that the leaf scale carbon uptake and water use ratio (water use efficiency, WUE) of beech (Fagus Sylvatica, L.) is homogenous within the canopy only depending on air humidity and light conditions (Linderson et al., 2012). This finding enables estimations of the canopy carbon uptake from its water use as estimated by sap flow measurements and thus to assess the individual tree carbon uptake and its variability.\nIn this study, the methodology developed for beech is tested for Norway spruce (Picea abies, L.) and further developed to comprise longer time scales (days to seasons) using existing leaf flux measurements from the Skogaryd ecosystem field research station (www.fieldsites.se). The shoot gas exchange was measured once every half hour at several heights in the canopy between 2007 and 2010, using automated chambers tracking ambient meteorological conditions. Air temperature, humidity and PAR were measured simultaneously and adjacent to the shoots. The VPD normalized WUE is assessed as the ratio between the carbon uptake and the conductance, where conductance is estimated from the measured transpiration divided by VPD.\nPreliminary results, using data from May to September and 6-18h to make the spruce and beech measurements comparable, show that the leaf scale VPD normalized WUE for spruce reaches light saturation at low PAR (on average 250 μmolm-2s-1), compared to beech (on avg. 500 μmolm-2s-1). For light saturating conditions, WUE is also higher for spruce (avg. 9 mmolmol-1hPa) than for beech (avg. 5 mmolmol-1hPa). These results indicate that spruce has a different water saving strategy than beech. The results will be further analyzed for within-canopy variability.\nLinderson, M-L. et al, 2012: Up-scaling of water use efficiency from leaf to canopy as based on leaf gas exchange relationships and the modeled in-canopy light distribution.

We demonstrate that maximum rates of true polar wander—wholesale rotation of mantle and crust around the core—have drastically decreased over the past one billion years. As true polar wander is rate-limited by the viscosity structure of the mantle, we interpret that the observed decay reflects the secular cooling of Earth. The magnitude of the decay indicates that the viscosity of the lower mantle has increased by an order of magnitude, and such a viscosity increase requires a cooling rate of greater than 100 K/Ga for the lower mantle. This rate is compatible with a recent petrological estimate on the cooling rate of the upper mantle, suggesting that the mantle as a whole has experienced rapid cooling since Neoproterozoic time.",

            "abstract": "The broad deformation zone of the Himalayan belt and Tibetan plateau is largely the product of continent-continent collision between India and Eurasia plates since the Early Eocene. Ophiolites exposed along the Yarlung Tsangpo Suture Zone (southern Tibet) demonstrate that a long-lasting intra-oceanic subduction zone must have played a significant role in accommodating closure of the >7500 km wide Neotethyan Ocean before continental collision. Their study can provide key constraints on the initial history of the Neotethyan subduction systems, and the following formation and emplacement of the ophiolite. Paleomagnetic analyses of the sheeted dykes complex of ophiolites have been successfully applied in the past to reconstruct the initial geometry of the spreading system associated to the ophiolite formation. Furthermore, oceanic detachment faults, structures widely occurring in modern magma-poor (slow-spreading) mid-ocean ridges, have been recently recognized also in ophiolites (i.e., Mirdita ophiolite of Albania), and (if present) their study may provide unique insights into the geodynamics and geometry of the associated spreading system. The YZSZ ophiolites form a 2500 km long belt mainly composed of dismembered ultramafic massifs locally covered by a crustal sequence and oceanic sediments, underlying a regionally continuous clastic Xigaze sedimentary basin interpreted as the Tibetan forearc. Our study focused along a ~250 km transect within the eastern sector of the YZSZ between the Sangsang and Xigatze ophiolite. Paleomagnetic, structural geological, and geochemical analyses evidenced the presence of fossil oceanic detachment faults that locally (Sangsang) exposed the lowermost units (mantle) directly at the seafloor. Based on this evidence, and the reconstructed rotation pattern of the region we propose a tectonic evolutionary model characterized by the interplay between magmatic crustal accretion and trench-parallel and trench-perpendicular tectonic extension, which resulted in thinning and dismemberment of the ophiolite.",

            "abstract": "Experimental constraints on the partitioning of moderately siderophile elements between metal and silicates during core formation suggest equilibration temperatures significantly greater than the liquidus of the silicate Earth (e.g., Wade and Wood, 2005). However, because equilibration was considered to occur in a ponded metal at the silicate solidus, such high temperature equilibration was rejected as implausible. Instead, lower temperature equilibration with variable oxygen fugacity was proposed as an alternative, although the plausibility of the physical mechanisms invoked in this scenario is also questionable. We have re-visited the model of metal-silicate separation in large molten pockets following energetic accretion events, and find that silicate-metal equlibration is most rapid when the iron rains out of the magma, and the release of gravitational potential energy by this rain heats the mixture by as much as 1000 K above the liquidus. However, the first drops of iron rain to pond at the base of the molten pocket will equilibrate at lower temperatures, and only the final drops will be subject to the highest temperatures. We model rain fall and heating of the magma by viscous dissipation to calculate the effective pressure-temperature conditions for partitioning in this scenario, and find that effective pressure conditions are smaller than the pressure at the base of the molten pocket. The ponded metal itself is gravitationally stratified (both in composition and temperature), and is not expected to convect or mix until it undergoes subsequent downward transport into the Earth's core. We also suggest that such a process operating during the very largest giant impact events (extending into the deep mantle) may have given rise to a buoyant oxygen-enriched metal layer atop the outer core, as suggested by some seismological models of the present-day Earth (e.g., Helffrich and Kaneshima, 2010).\n",

            "abstract": "Urbanization is a result of aggregation of people in urban areas that can help advance socioeconomic development and pull out people from the poverty line. However, if not monitored well, it can also lead to loss of farmlands, natural forests as well as to societal impacts including burgeoning growth of slums, pollution, and crime. Thus, spatiotemporal information that shapes the urbanization is thus critical to the process of urban planning. The overall objective of this study is to develop an impervious surface fraction algorithm (ISFA) for automatically mapping urban areas from Landsat data. We processed the data for 1986, 2001 and 2014 to trace the multi-decadal spatiotemporal change of Honduran capital city using a three-step procedure: (1) data pre-processing to perform image normalization as well as to produce the difference in the values (DVSS) between the simple ratio (SR) of green and shortwave bands and the soil adjust vegetation index (SAVI), (2) quantification of urban areas using ISFA, and (3) accuracy assessment of mapping results using the ground reference data constructed using land-cover maps and FORMOSAT-2 imagery. The mapping accuracy assessment was performed for 2001 and 2014 by comparing with the ground reference data indicated satisfactory results with the overall accuracies and Kappa coefficients generally higher than 90% and 0.8, respectively. When examining the urbanization between these years, it could be observed that the urban area was significantly expanded from 1986 to 2014, mainly driven by two factors of rapid population growth and socioeconomic development. This study eventually leads to a realization of the merit of using ISFA for multi-decadal monitoring of the urbanization of Honduran capital city from Landsat data. Results from this research can be used by urban planners as a general indicator to quantify urban change and environmental impacts. The methods were thus transferable to monitor urban growth in cities and their peri areas around the world.",

            "abstract": "Cassini Jupiter encounter, in the late 2000 and the early 2001, revealed persistent properties of Jovian hectometric (HOM) radiation, which is produced along auroral magnetic field lines in the polar regions of Jupiter. One of the unique properties - known as attenuation lanes (or so-called attenuation bands) - appears as a recurrent, well defined intensity extinction/enhancement feature in the HOM dynamic spectrum. It is believed that this phenomenon is the consequence of ray refraction from high-density medium - either (1) the field-aligned enhanced density along Io plasma torus or (2) Io plasma torus itself or both - in the course of radio propagation from the radio source to the observer. Many studies, mainly on case (1), have used standard ray-tracing technique, which cannot provide reliable information on transmitted radiation intensity. In this study, we have investigated case (2) by using an \"enhanced\" ray-tracing technique, in which a family of neighboring rays is simultaneously traced, allowing the physical intensity to be estimated along the ray path. We show the results of our ray-tracing computations and then suggest the most plausible scenario for the attenuation lanes phenomenon. More generally and from this example, we conclude that existing refracting plasma structures, encountered by radiation along its ray path through the planetary magnetosphere, might strongly affect, while not taken into account, the overall properties of the radio emission measured by a distant observer.",

We use a sequence of vector magnetograms and Dopplergrams from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) aboard the SDO to drive magnetofrictional (MF) model of the coronal magnetic field in the the vicinity of AR 11944, where an X1.2 flare on January 7 2014 occurred. To drive the coronal field we impose a time-dependent boundary condition based on temporal sequences of magnetic and electric fields at the bottom of the computational domain, i.e. the photosphere. To derive the electric fields we use a recently improved poloidal-toroidal decomposition (PTD), which we call the ``PTD-Doppler-FLCT-Ideal'' or PDFI technique. We investigate the results of the simulated coronal evolution, compare those with EUV observations from Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and discuss what we could learn from them.

            "abstract": "Miners in many countries use mercury as an amalgam to separate gold from river sediments. In the last twenty years the price of gold has risen and the number of small-scale, artisanal gold mining operations in the Amazon basin have also increased. The influx of mercury into natural river systems has detrimental consequences for the surrounding ecosystem and for organisms, particularly those at higher trophic levels. Toxic mercury levels have been shown to impair reproductive, neurological and behavioral functioning of organisms.\nI used bats (Chiroptera) as a mammalian model system to study mercury contamination and accumulation due to gold mining from field caught and museum collection specimens in Amazonian Perú and showed that: (1) Total mercury concentrations in Amazonian bat species have increased over time since the 1920’s; (2) Bat species from sites with current active mining have higher concentrations of mercury than non-mining sites, with some species having levels exceeding those considered toxic for mammals; (3) Higher trophic levels of bats (piscivores and insectivores) bioaccumulate more mercury than bats of lower trophic levels (frugivores); (4) Bats located in present day uncontaminated sites have the same mercury levels as bats collected in the 1920’s from the Amazon basin.\nThe variety of bat feeding guilds allowed for a comparison of how mercury accumulation is affected by diet within one taxonomic order. The novel use of museum specimens allowed for a look back into the historical timeline of mercury contamination in the Amazon basin. Bats represent a new and exciting study system since, like humans, they are mammals and should therefore show similar neurochemical and behavioral responses to this toxic element.",

            "abstract": "Soils of high-latitude ecosystems store a large fraction of the global soil carbon pool. In boreal forests, the mineralization of soil organic matter (SOM) during winter by soil heterotrophic activity can affect the ecosystems net carbon balance. Recent research has shown that microorganisms in the organic surface layer of boreal forest soil can mineralize and grow on simple, monomeric substrates under frozen conditions. However, any substantial impacts of microbial activity in frozen soils on long-term soil carbon balances depend on whether soil microorganisms can utilize the more complex, polymeric substrates in SOM. In order to evaluate the potential for soil microorganisms to metabolize carbon polymers at low temperatures, we incubated boreal forest soil samples amended with [13C]-cellulose and studied the microbial catabolic and anabolic utilization of the substrate under frozen and unfrozen conditions (-4 and +4°C). The [13C]-CO2 production rate in the samples at +4°C were 0.524 mg CO2 SOM -1 day-1 while rates in the frozen samples (-4°C) were 0.008 mg CO2 SOM -1 day-1. Thus, freezing of the soil markedly reduced microbial utilization of the cellulose. However, newly synthetized [13C]-enriched cell membrane lipids, PLFAs, were detected in soil samples incubated both above and below freezing, confirming microbial growth also in the frozen soil matrix. The reduced metabolic rates induced by freezing indicate constraints on exoenzymatic activity, as well as substrate diffusion rates that we can attribute to reduced liquid water content of the frozen soil. We conclude that the microbial population in boreal forest soil has the capacity to metabolize, and grow, on polymeric substrates at temperatures below zero. This also involves maintaining exoenzymatic activity in frozen soils. This capacity manifests the importance of SOM mineralization during the winter season and its importance for the net carbon balance of soils of high-latitude ecosystems.",

With the aim on unveil the essence of nucleation process, as well as the behavior of the multiphase magmatic fluid, we performed slow decompression experiments in a shock tube system. We choose silicon oil as analogue for the magmatic melt, and saturated it with Argon at 10 MPa for 72h. The slow decompression to atmospheric conditions was monitored through a high speed camera and pressure sensors, located into the experimental conduit. The experimental conditions of the decompression process have then been reproduced numerically with a compressible multiphase solver based on OpenFOAM. Numerical simulations have been performed by the OpenFOAM compressibleInterFoam solver for 2 compressible, non-isothermal immiscible fluids, using a VOF (volume of fluid) phase-fraction based interface capturing approach. The data extracted from 2D images obtained from laboratory analyses were compared to the outcome of numerical investigation, showing the capability of the model to capture the main processes studied.",

Gas hydrates, as indicated by the BSR, are most abundant at the northern edge of the Knipovich Ridge, a slow-spreading ridge that is part of the Mid-Atlantic ridge system. The ridge is characterized by a central rift valley and steep flanks covered by up to 1.5 km of sediments. In this study, we investigate how the Knipovich Ridge influences the gas hydrate system offshore western Svalbard. Based on BSR-derived heat flow values from new 2D seismic data acquired during cruise MSM21-4 in 2012 and seismic data from previous cruises, as well as heat flow measurements, we devised a heat flow map for the Svalbard margin. BSR-derived heat flow values range between 55 mWm-2 and 346 mWm-2, while measured heat flow values are in the order of 73-247 mWm-2. Heat flow increases towards the ridge axis, with the highest values observed in the central rift valley. The heat associated with the spreading ridge may have been sufficient to cause thermogenic methane production during burial of Eocene organic-rich sequences, which could explain the enhanced presence of gas hydrates in the vicinity of the ridge.",

            "abstract": "In most ophiolites, the contact between the mantle peridotites and the gabbroic cumulates from the lower oceanic crust is underlined by a horizon of dunite ranging in thickness from a few meters to a few hundred meters. The genesis of this dunitic transition zone (DTZ) can be attributed to different processes that are not necessarily mutually exclusive. They include olivine accumulation from high-Mg melts, reaction melting between a mantle peridotite and a melt under-saturated with pyroxene, destabilization of pyroxenes by high temperature fluid-rock reaction in conditions of water saturation. To precise and quantify the nature of these reactions and to determine their relative contribution has a major impact on our understanding of basalt genesis and of the chemical budgets at oceanic spreading centers. To reach this objective, we densely sampled the DTZ across several sections in the different massifs of the Oman ophiolites. The chemical composition of the dunites (WR major element and REE concentrations, microprobe data) presents a dramatic but not random variability both along single cross sections and from one cross section to the others. As an example, REE concentrations are a useful tool to investigate the petrogenetic processes behind this organization: in this study we have developed a chemical protocol in order to determine precisely (below 1% RSD) their concentrations, even for very low values (down to 0.1 ng.g-1). REE concentrations in true dunites are intensely variables: 0.5<[La]<100 ng.g-1; 0.1<[Eu]<4 ng.g-1; 8<[Yb]<50 ng.g-1. These variations are not random, LREE (La/Sm) ratios inversely correlate with HREE (Gd/Yb) ratios, which is a characteristic of melt/rock interaction. The various chemical tracers (major, minor and trace elements) indicate that the deep levels of the DTZ record a complex interaction history between mantle peridotites and various kinds of melts + fluids that migrated, stagnated and crystallized at different levels of this horizon, consistent with the “reactive filter” hypothesis. The shallow levels of the DTZ, however, present chemical trends becoming more and more consistent with an origin by fractional crystallization and olivine accumulation from primitive basalts as the gabbroic cumulates are approached.",

            "abstract": "The North-East Greenland ice stream reaches about 700 km inland and drains a major part of the Greenland ice sheet via marine terminating glaciers at the western edge of the North-East Greenland Continental Shelf (NEGCS). Previous studies suggested that, during full-glacial periods, the ice sheet only extended to the inner shelf and did not reach further to the east. Based on radiocarbon dating data it was hypothesized that the Greenland Ice Sheet reached onto the middle shelf or even the shelf edge. An advance at least to the middle shelf at about 79.5 to 80.5° N was later demonstrated by two studies using new high-resolution swath bathymetric data that showed seafloor features, including mega-scale glacial lineations and retreat moraines, indicating past ice stream activity. These data, however, only provided a fragmented picture of the behaviour of this North-East sector of the Greenland ice sheet, with the majority of the NEGCS area unmapped.\nNow, we have newly processed bathymetric data from R/V Polarstern that was acquired in the area of the NEGCS from 76° to 81° N throughout the last 25 years. In addition we include processed data collected by other institutions. In total, swath bathymetric data from 26 cruises has been investigated for glacigenic seafloor features. All glacigenic seafloor features have been mapped to provide a holistic overview of the area. We present the current stage of our investigation. It shows that glacial activity on the NEGCS was far more intense than previously estimated and that the ice sheet extended even further offshore.",

            "abstract": "Stable isotopes of water naturally occurring in rainwater have the potential to reveal principal transport mechanisms at multiple scales – from soil profile to hillslope and catchment scale. In this contribution, we study transport processes at the hillslope scale by combining field observations of hillslope discharge and the associated oxygen-18 contents with detailed process-based numerical modeling. In the one-dimensional (1D) approach, 1D dual-continuum vertical flow and transport model (based on Richards and advection-dispersion equations) is coupled with 1D single-continuum lateral flow and transport model (based on diffusion wave equation for saturated subsurface flow and advection-dispersion equation for isotope transport). In the two-dimensional (2D) approach, the movement of water in a variably saturated hillslope segment is modeled as vertical planar flow (i.e., the vertical and lateral flow components are fully integrated into one flow system). Both modeling approaches, taking into account flow and transport through the soil matrix and the system of preferential pathways, were used to simulate the subsurface processes during observed rainfall–runoff episodes. The observed subsurface runoff and its oxygen-18 composition were compared with the model predictions. In addition, contributions of pre-event and event water to hillslope runoff during major rainfall–runoff episodes were evaluated by means of numerical experiments involving synthetic oxygen-18 rainfall signatures. The simulated hillslope responses showed a reasonable agreement with the experimental data in terms of subsurface runoff and oxygen-18 transport dynamics. Pre-event water was found to be the significant runoff component in most major rainfall–runoff events, though preferential flow played an important role in the hillslope runoff formation.",

            "abstract": "Fracturing is the most prevalent deformation mechanism in rocks deformed in the laboratory under simulated upper crustal conditions. Fracturing produces acoustic emissions (AE) at the laboratory scale and earthquakes on a crustal scale. The AE technique provides a means to analyse microcracking activity inside the rock volume and since experiments can be performed under confining pressure to simulate depth of burial, AE can be used as a proxy for natural processes such as earthquakes.\nExperimental rock deformation provides us with several ways to investigate time-dependent brittle deformation. Two main types of experiments can be distinguished: (1) “constant strain rate” experiments in which stress varies as a result of deformation, and (2) “creep” experiments in which deformation and deformation rate vary over time as a result of an imposed constant stress.\nWe conducted constant strain rate experiments on air-dried Darley Dale sandstone samples in a variety of confining pressures (30MPa, 50MPa, 80MPa) and in water saturated samples with 20 MPa initial pore fluid pressure. The results from these experiments used to determine the initial loading in the creep experiments.\nNon-extensive statistical physics approach was applied to the AE data in order to investigate the spatio-temporal pattern of cracks close to failure. A more detailed study was performed for the data from the creep experiments. When axial stress is plotted against time we obtain the trimodal creep curve. Calculation of Tsallis entropic index q is performed to each stage of the curve and the results are compared with the ones from the constant strain rate experiments.\nThe Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence model (ETAS) is also applied to each stage of the creep curve and the ETAS parameters are calculated. We investigate whether these parameters are constant across all stages of the curve, or whether there are interesting patterns of variation.\nThis research has been co-funded by the European Union (European Social Fund) and Greek national resources under the framework of the “THALES Program: SEISMO FEAR HELLARC” project of the “Education & Lifelong Learning” Operational Programme.",

            "abstract": "It has been well established that electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves can resonantly interact with relativistic (E > 1 MeV) electrons and result in pitch angle scattering of the electrons. Through this wave-particle resonant interaction, significant electron losses to the atmosphere over some drift orbits are expected. Nevertheless, the direct observation evidence of precipitating electrons by EMIC wave scattering is limited, because the resonant interactions between EMIC waves and relativistic electrons are not fully understood and simultaneously measuring the relativistic electrons at low altitudes and the EMIC waves in the magnetosphere is often difficult. Using measurements from the Van Allen Probes, BARREL, and NOAA/POES, we perform a data-analysis study of EMIC waves and associated relativistic electron precipitation (REP) observed on 25-26 January 2013. The Van Allen Probe-B detected significant EMIC wave activity at L=2.1-3.9 and MLT=21.0-23.4 from 2353 UT, 25 January 2013 to 0046 UT, 26 January 2013. Meanwhile, NOAA/POES and BARREL detected REP events. Particularly, BARREL-1T observed clear precipitation of relativistic electrons at L~4.1 and MLT~20.7 for 33 minutes from 2342 UT, 25 January 2013. The total radiation belt electron content, estimated from local relativistic electron measurements on the Van Allen Probes, also demonstrates internal losses of the electrons around the EMIC wave activity. To further confirm the conjunction of the EMIC waves and REP, we calculate the electron minimum resonant energy (Emin) and pitch angle diffusion coefficient (Dαα) of the EMIC wave packets by using nominal ion composition, derived total ion density from the frequencies of upper hybrid resonance, and measured ambient and wave magnetic field.",

            "abstract": "Fluid mixing plays a fundamental role in many natural and engineered processes, including groundwater flows in porous media, enhanced oil recovery, and microfluidic lab-on-a-chip systems[1]. Recent developments have explored the effect of viscosity contrast on mixing, suggesting that the unstable displacement of fluids with different viscosities, or viscous fingering, provides a powerful mechanism to increase fluid--fluid interfacial area and enhance mixing[2]. In this paper, we revisit the problem of subsurface contaminant transport through a heterogeneous aquifer in a quarter five-spot geometry[3] and we focus on the impact of two principal sources of disorder in the flow field: viscosity contrast between the fluids and heterogeneity in the permeability field. We consider a wide range of viscosity ratios of the contaminant and the water, from a less viscous to a more viscous contaminant, flowing through a range of permeability fields, from almost homogeneous to strongly heterogeneous. We ask the following practical question: how does the interplay between viscosity contrast and permeability heterogeneity determine the evolution of macroscopic quantities that characterize the spatial structure and temporal evolution of a contaminant plume? We answer this question by conducting high resolution simulations of contaminant flow and transport in an aquifer, and by analyzing both point measurements of contaminant breakthrough and clean-up times as well as global degree of mixing and dilution of the contaminant plume.\n[1] M.

In this paper we report the spatial and temporal variability of the high L-shell, low energy He-ion phase-space densities (PSD), as measured on both spacecraft during non-storm intervals. We find that the He-ion PSD at these locations and energies change dramatically from orbit to orbit across similar regions of the magnetosphere, and this variability is often related to simultaneously-observed variability in H-ion PSD (also at high L-shell and low energy). We show that the hourly modulation of both species is highly correlated to Pc1 and Pc3 wave activity. Specifically, we conclude that Pc3 frequency bounce-resonant ULF waves are responsible for scattering of He-ions, and thus control the non-storm morphology of ring current He-ions.",

            "abstract": "With earth science relevant to so many societal challenges, we created an introductory geology course as a forum for students to explore the interplay between geoscience and society. With new media and digital tools enabling such rich collaboration, we designed the course as a fully online lecture and laboratory experience that meets the natural science general education requirements of our university. We hook students by using popular Hollywood blockbusters paired with documentary films that address related science content. Student ask questions using an online question ranking tool (Google Moderator) to guide the direction of further content delivery using the slide sharing/collaboration tool 'VoiceThread.' It allows instructors to post slides, add video narration, and invite students to comment or answer specific questions using video, voice, or text. Students report that VoiceThread makes an asynchronous class feel like a face-to-face experience. Student also collect data using online tools and pool their data in Google Spreadsheets. They discuss their collective findings in VoiceThread. With these tools in place, each content unit culminates with a challenge scenario. Students work in teams to come to a consensus about a real-world decision that requires them to apply their geologic knowledge. Examples include whether or not to evacuate a town in light of volcanic activity, which house to purchase in an earthquake prone area, which industry was polluting local groundwater, and whether or not to sell mineral rights for hydraulic fracturing. While many of these activities are widely utilized, our approach using them in an integrated online lecture/lab environment is unique. A survey of student attitudes towards the course revealed that students felt a stronger personal connection to the course instructor and one another than typical face-to-face GE classes, including those from our own department. Students' self-report of how much they learned was strongly correlated to their perceived sense of community. We attribute the high course grades and low failure rates (30% A's with only 13% D/F/W) to this sense of community and the socially relevant content it enabled students to engage, as the scores were much higher than more traditional face-to-face courses taught by the same instructors.",

Recent field observations have revealed that changes in stability are accompanied by changes in wind speed, direction, and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). In order to isolate the effects of stability, large-eddy simulations (LES) are performed under neutral, stable, and unstable conditions, keeping the wind speed and direction unchanged at a fixed height. The Lillgrund wind farm, comprising of 48 turbines, is studied in this research with the Simulator for Offshore/Onshore Wind Farm Applications (SOWFA) developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Unlike most previous numerical simulations, this study does not impose periodic boundary conditions and therefore is ideal for evaluating the effects of stability in large, but finite, wind farms. Changes in power generation, velocity deficit, rate of wake recovery, TKE, and surface temperature are quantified as a function of atmospheric stability. The sensitivity of these results to wind direction is also discussed.",

The retrieval uses a-priori information to produce a pan-Arctic water vapour column dataset that has high spatial (15 km at nadir) and temporal resolution (twice daily) with relatively low amounts of error compared to other retrievals. A comparison of the MHS retrieval with the satellite-borne Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument and Reanalysis datasets was completed using the G-Band Water Vapour Radiometer (GVR), located in Barrow, Alaska (71N, 156W).\nAn assessment of the Arctic radiosonde network is shown to quantify the quality of water vapour measurements at each station. Time evolution of the precipitable water fields can provide insight into the dehydration of the atmosphere in the Arctic. A water budget for the Arctic can be constructed using the high spatial and temporal resolution analysis. The high resolution and low noise of this retrieval technique will potentially allow for the measurement of water vapour from Arctic phenomena such as ice leads.",

            "abstract": "Ancient cratons are generally characterised by Archaean cores surrounded by Proterozoic accretionary belts with large volumes of juvenile crust. Their crustal growth histories provide important insights into the genesis of continents and orogenic evolution. Whole-rock and detrital zircon isotopic studies are often used to deduce those histories, but the extent to which representative lithologies within the orogens are reliably sampled for such studies is not well established. This is especially true in cases where juvenile, zircon-poor mafic crust comprises a significant proportion of an orogen such as the East African (0.8-0.5 Ga), Namaqua-Natal (1.2-1.0 Ga), Trans-Hudson (1.9-1.8 Ga), and Kola (2.5 Ga). In particular, the Mesoproterozoic Namaqua-Natal orogenic belt (NNO) fringing the Kalahari Craton is a case in point in which Nd isotopic studies of whole-rock outcrop samples and U-Pb-Hf isotopic studies of detrital zircons from sediments of the Orange River (which drains the NNO) show different crust-formation ages and proportions of new and reworked crustal material. We hypothesise that this discrepancy is due to biasing of the detrital zircon record towards felsic rocks. Understanding the representative nature of the crustal archive preserved in detrital zircons remains critical for many studies of crustal evolution. We present data that: (a) addresses the scale of potential bias within an accretionary orogen containing large proportions of juvenile material, (b) demonstrates how the whole-rock and detrital zircon records can be reconciled for the Namaqua-Natal orogen to start, and (c) can be used to evaluate the effect of zircon bias on previous crustal growth models.",

The system has been developed using five existing model components: the high resolution regional climate model HIRHAM5, the regional ocean model HYCOM and the CICE model that describes sea ice dynamics, the PISM ice sheet model and the GIPL permafrost model. These models have been interactively coupled which enables us to perform experiments examining the relative importance of ocean and atmospheric forcing as well as internal dynamics, to explain the recent rapid decline of Arctic sea ice, recent changes in the Greenland ice sheet mass balance together with both land and sub-sea permafrost conditions. Analysis of the model results indicates the model can successfully reproduce the interannual and seasonal variability in sea ice extent, describe recent changes in the Greenland ice sheet surface mass balance as well as permafrost conditions around Greenland and possibly under the Arctic Ocean sea floor. This opens up the possibility of a range of process based experiments as well as simulations to project the future and study the past of Arctic sea ice that we plan to run using the EC-Earth GCM as boundary forcing.\nExamples, focusing on various coupling issues will be presented and the need for further refinements will be assessed by highlighting processes that appear to be essential to the interactions and hence possibly important at climate scales.",

            "abstract": "Within the wide approach of watershed management, the crucial role of floodplains in hydrological processes and runoff generation, in particular during flood events, is well known. The recent changes in land use and/or intense rainfall patterns associated to climate changes, however, add complexity to the analysis of the hydrologic response. This study investigates and displays evidences and effects of land use changes and climatic changes in a small floodplain area in the north east of Italy. As in other countries in Europe, over the past half-century, intense urban and agricultural land uses changed the drainage networks, causing serious hydraulic dysfunctions. In this work we focused the research on the network drainage density and storage capacity, considering that they are the main requirements for hydraulic infrastructures and that the storage of water is crucial for any water management strategy. The effects of the changes in the network parameters have been then further investigated using the Network Saturation Index (NSI) that quantifies how fast an area is saturated by a design rainfall and can give an idea of the delay of the watershed response respect to the rainfall peak. Over the past half-century, the study site witnessed a drastic reduction of the storage volume, resulting in shorter times for saturation especially for storm events having a shorter return period and for events that were less critical in the past. For our case study, climatic evidence shows that the rainfall regime is highly irregular, with intense events taking an increasing role in determining the total precipitation over the past half-century. Considering this climatic trend that cannot be controlled, our study suggests to carefully plan the changes in the drainage networks, as these changes might seriously constrain the functionality of the reclamation system, especially for rather frequent rainfall events not necessarily associated with extreme meteorological conditions or with the worst case scenarios.\nSofia, G., Prosdocimi, M., Dalla Fontana, G., Tarolli, P.

            "abstract": "Hydrodynamic models represent an important component in flood prediction systems. Unfortunately, providing reliable model predictions and reducing the associated uncertainties remain challenging; especially for poorly gauged river basins. As SAR flood image databases are significant (and expected to grow rapidly with contributions from new satellites such as Sentinel-1) there are obvious opportunities to use these flood images to improve model predictions.\nIn this context our aim is to contribute to the development of a global and near real-time remote sensing service that delivers flood predictions to support flood management around the globe. The study takes advantage of recently developed efficient, rapid and automatic algorithms for the delineation of flood extent using SAR images. The main objective of the study is to show how near real-time sequential assimilation of SAR derived flood extents can improve model predictions.\nAs a test case we use the July 2007 flood event of the river Severn (UK) and the February 2007 flood event of the lower river Zambezi (Mozambique). We use the Lisflood-FP hydraulic model and we adopt the particle filter as assimilation technique. An important issue in the framework of the assimilation of remote sensing-derived information is to quantify observation uncertainty. To do so we introduce an original image processing approach that assigns to each pixel a ‘probability to be flooded’ based on its backscatter values.\nThe sequential assimilation of SAR-derived flood extent maps show a significant improvement in the hydraulic model predictions although the addition of sequences of images with similar flood extents has some limit. The main achievement of the study is that model predictions are clearly improved by the assimilation of SAR derived flood extent not only in terms of predicted flooded areas but also in terms of predicted discharge and water level hydrographs.",

            "abstract": "Fast-track programs to plant millions of trees in cities around the world aim at the reduction of summer temperatures, increase carbon storage, storm water control, provision of space for recreation, as well as poverty alleviation. Although these multiple benefits speak positively for urban greening programs, the programs do not take into account how close human and natural systems are coupled in urban areas. Elevated temperatures together with anthropogenic emissions of air and water pollutants distinguish the urban system. Urban and sub-urban vegetation responds to ambient changes and reacts with pollutants. Neglecting the existence of this coupling may lead to unforeseen drawbacks of urban greening programs. The potential for emissions from urban vegetation combined with anthropogenic emissions to produce ozone has long been recognized. This potential increases under rising temperatures. Here we investigate how global change induced heat waves affect emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) from urban vegetation and corresponding ground-level ozone levels. We also quantify other ecosystem services provided by urban vegetation (e.g., cooling and carbon storage) and their sensitivity to climate change. In this study we use Weather Research and Forecasting Model with coupled atmospheric chemistry (WRF-CHEM) to quantify these feedbacks in Berlin, Germany during the heat waves in 2003 and 2006. We highlight the importance of the vegetation for urban areas under changing climate and discuss associated tradeoffs.",

            "abstract": "The Sanjiang Plain is located in the eastern part of Heilongjiang Province, Northeastern China, and represents one of major agricultural regions nationwide. Over past decades, this region has seen intensive cropland reclamation and a sharp shrinkage of natural vegetation and water bodies, driven by not only policy-making and economic development, but also a warming climate. However, it still remains unclear how climate change has influenced the magnitude and spatial patterns of land use changes. In this study, we examined spatial and temporal variations of rice paddy planting area during 1980-2008 through an integration of the remote-sensing images, the census data, and other existing land use/cover data sets. The daily gridded climate data sets were generated by using an interpolation method of thin plate smoothing splines, based on observations from over 70 meteorological stations across the study area. Our results suggest that the rice paddy planting area increased by more than 10-fold during 1980-2008, with more obvious upward trends during two sub-periods, i.e. 1995-1998 and 2004-2008. Further analyses indicated that the rice paddy planting area accounted for approximately 20.3% of total cropland area in 2008, increasing more than seven-fold as compared to 1980. When investigating spatially, we found that the planting boundary of rice paddy expanded northward for roughly 2 degree, comparing to 1984 when most of rice paddies were found in the north of the 48o N. Most of increases of rice paddy planting area occurred in the northeast of the study region. The climate analyses showed a significant warming trend, with a slightly decrease in precipitation. During the study period, the suitable areas for rice production increased about 25% and expanded northward clearly. Our study demonstrated how climate change influenced the magnitude and spatial patterns of rice paddy planting area in the Sanjiang Plain, which could provide scientific information for the environmental assessment and related policy-making. It implies that climate change could result in substantial land use/cover changes through climate adaption strategies that humans adopted. While, how to compromise those adaption strategies and environmental sustainability (e.g., preserving water resources and biodiversity) need further invstigation.",

Through the European-funded SIGMA (Stimulating Innovation for Global Monitoring of Agriculture and its Impact on the Environment in support of GEOGLAM) project, IIASA is continuing to support GEOGLAM by providing cropland projections in the future and modelling environmental impacts on agriculture under various scenarios. In addition, IIASA is focusing on two specific elements within SIGMA: the development of a global field size and irrigation map; and mobile app development for in-situ data collection and validation of remotely-sensed products.\nCropland field size is a very useful indicator for agricultural monitoring yet the information we have at a global scale is currently very limited. IIASA has already created a global map of field size at a 1 km resolution using crowdsourced data from Geo-Wiki as a first approximation. Using automatic classification of Landsat imagery and algorithms contained within Google Earth Engine, initial experimentation has shown that circular fields and landscape structures can easily be extracted. Not only will this contribute to improving the global map of field size, it can also be used to create a global map that contains a large proportion of the world’s irrigated areas, which will be another useful contribution to GEOGLAM. The field size map will also be used to stratify and develop a global crop map in SIGMA.\nMobile app development in support of in-situ data collection is another area where IIASA is currently working. An Android app has been built using the Open Data Toolkit (ODK) and extended further with spatial mapping capabilities called GeoODK. The app allows users to collect data on different crop types and delineate fields on the ground, which can be used to validate the field size map. The app can also cache map data so that high resolution satellite imagery and reference data from the users can be viewed in the field without the need for an internet connection. This app will be used for calibration and validation of the data products in SIGMA, e.g. data collection at JECAM (Joint Experiment of Crop Assessment and Monitoring) sites.",

            "abstract": "Seismic anisotropy has close relationships with past and present tectonic and dynamic processes. Therefore, detailed description of seismic anisotropy of subduction zones provides important information for our understanding of the subduction system.\nThe most common method of detecting anisotropy is the S-wave splitting measurement. However, conventional S-wave splitting analysis is not an appropriate way to investigate anisotropy in the mantle and slab because the technique has no vertical resolution. Thus, we have improved common traveltime tomography to estimate three-dimensional anisotropic structures of P-wave, assuming that the modeling space is composed of weakly anisotropic medium with a hexagonal symmetry about a horizontal axis (Ishise & Oda, 2005, JGR; Ishise & Oda, 2008, PEPI). Recently, we extended the anisotropic tomography for P-wave radial anisotropy with vertical hexagonal symmetry axis (Ishise & Kawakatsu, 2012 JpGU).\nIn this study, we expand the study area of our previous regional analyses of P-wave azimuthal and radial anisotropic tomography (Ishise & Oda, 2005; Ishise & Kawakatsu, 2012, JpGU; Ishise et al., 2012, SSJ) using Hi-net arrival time data and examine the subduction system around the Japan islands, where two trenches with different strike directions and plate junction are included.\nHere are some of the remarkable results associated with the PAC slab and mantle structure. (1) N–S-trending fast axis of P-wave anisotropy is dominant in the PAC slab. (2) the mantle wedge shows trench-normal anisotropy across the trench-trench junction. (3) horizontal velocity (PH) tends to be faster than vertical velocity (PV) in the slab. (4) PV tends to be faster than PH in the mantle wedge.\nThe characteristics of the obtained azimuthal and radial anisotropy of the PAC slab and the mantle wedge qualitatively consistent with heterogeneous plate models (e.g., Furumura & Kennet, 2005) and numerical simulations of mantle flow (Morishige & Honda, 2011; 2013). In addition, the azimuthal anisotropy in the PAC slab that we obtained is subparallel to that in the PAC plate before subducting (e.g., Shimamura et al., 1983). Therefore, we suggest that the slab anisotropy is “frozen anisotropy”, which is attributed to the episode before subduction, and mantle wedge anisotropy reflects present dynamics.",

            "abstract": "The identification of waves from satellite data typically requires a data window such that the phase space of the wave of interest is appropriately sampled. As satellites precess slowly, a few weeks of data is generally required for the diagnosis of migrating tides to completely sample the phase space. As has been noted in earlier studies this results in aliasing of zonal mean into migrating tides when the zonal mean varies over time. Similarly stationary planetary wave amplitudes varying over time alias into non-migrating tides and vice versa. Data gaps also can affect the authentic diagnosis of wave amplitudes and phases. In this paper, we report on a study of aliasing effects on various temperature wave components in a few satellite data sets (SABER and COSMIC). The effects of sampling are studied using a run of CMAM30 and sampling the model data in the same manner as the satellites. It is found that the derived amplitudes of the non-migrating tides and planetary waves depend on the sampling and method of analysis. Further, the aliasing also depends on latitude for measurements taken by the same satellite due to yaw maneuvers, if any, and care must be taken in interpreting results from any particular satellite.",

            "abstract": "The strong hydrothermal activity exhibited at Campi Flegrei by the Solfatara and Pisciarelli fumaroles points to a significant risk for phreatic eruptions in this densely populated area. Phreatic eruptions, triggered by various processes are hardly predictable in occurrence time and size. Despite their hazard potential, these eruptions, as well as the influence of hydrothermal alteration on their likelihood, magnitude and style, have so far been largely overlooked in experimental volcanology.\nThe physical properties and the mechanical behavior of volcanic rocks are highly dependent on their original magmatic microstructure and on any eventual alteration of those microstructures due to hydrothermal reactions. We have therefore investigated the potential effects of hydrothermal alteration on rock microstructure and, as a consequence, on fragmentation dynamics.\nRock samples from the vicinity of the Solfatara fumaroles have been characterized 1) geochemically (X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction), 2) physically (density, porosity, permeability and elastic wave velocity) and 3) mechanically (uniaxial compressive strength, tensile strength). We have investigated the effects of hydrothermal alteration on fragmentation processes using a shock-tube apparatus, operating with Argon gas, water vapor and superheated water at temperatures up to 400°C and maximum pressures of 20 MPa. The three different energy sources within the pores initiating fragmentation, have been investigated: overpressure by 1) Argon gas; or 2) water vapor and due to 3) steam flashing of water. Fragmentation speed, fragmentation efficiency and fragmented particle ejection velocity were measured. Our results indicate, that steam flashing provides the highest energy - resulting in increased particle ejection velocity and higher fragmentation efficiency.\nBased on our results, we aim to constrain the influence of hydrothermal alteration on the dynamics of phreatic explosions and the effect on the amount of energy, released by the different sources. The results may provide valuable information for the hazard assessment of well characterized, hydrothermally active areas.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic properties of marine sediments in the Galician Rias, in NW Spain, have shown that in these shallow marine settings the magnetic mineral assemblage, and its bulk magnetic properties, is controlled by grain size, wave climate, and organic matter content. The grain size effect is explained by concentration of diamagnetic biogenic carbonates in the coarse fraction, which dilutes the concentration-dependent magnetic properties. Furthermore, this effect is enhanced by the hydrodynamic sorting of the heavy minerals, like magnetite, that become concentrated in the finer fractions. Waves on the other hand concentrate the coarser bioclasts in the shallower areas along the coastal margins of the rias, and consequently these areas show the lowest magnetic mineral concentrations. Magnetic minerals are therefore more abundant in the deeper central axis and towards the external, more oceanic, areas of the rias. Another effect of waves is periodic resuspension of fine sediments, which allows them to be reoxigenated preventing the onset of reductive diagenesis. This effect is best seen in sediment cores, where organic matter remineralization promotes dissolution of magnetic iron oxides and oxyhydroxides. Areas where resuspension is frequent and/or deeper areas where sediments stay in the water column for longer have lower degrees of reductive early diagenesis. In addition to its downcore effect, organic matter also controls the magnetic properties of surficial sediments. Our results in the Ria de Muros, at the north of our study area, have shown that a simple kinetic model is enough to quantify the effect of organic matter content on the dissolution of magnetite. We have found that a Total Organic Carbon increase of 0.35% reduces magnetite concentration of surface samples by half. These effects observed in the Ria de Muros have also been confirmed for published results in the southern Rias Baixas previously studied by our research group.",

Based on a historical review of the compilation of seismic hazard zoning maps for the Georgia became evident that there were gaps in seismic hazard assessment and the present normative seismic hazard map needed a careful recalculation.\nThe methodology for the probabilistic assessment of seismic hazard used here includes the following steps: produce comprehensive catalogue of historical earthquakes (up to 1900) and the period of instrumental observations with uniform scale of magnitudes; produce models of seismic source zones (SSZ) and their parameterization; develop appropriate ground motion prediction equation (GMPE) models; develop seismic hazard curves for spectral amplitudes at each period and maps in digital format.\nFirstly, the new seismic catalog of Georgia was created, with 1700 eqs from ancient times on 2012, Mw³4.0.\nSecondly, were allocated seismic source zones (SSZ). The identification of area SSZ was obtained on the bases of structural geology, parameters of seismicity and seismotectonics. In constructing the SSZ, the slope of the appropriate active fault plane, the width of the dynamic influence of the fault, power of seismoactive layer are taken into account. Finally each SSZ was defined with the parameters: the geometry, the percentage of focal mechanism, predominant azimuth and dip angle values, activity rates, maximum magnitude, hypocenter depth distribution, lower and upper seismogenic depth values.\nThirdly, seismic hazard maps were calculated based on modern approach of selecting and ranking global and regional ground motion prediction equation for region.\nFinally, probabilistic seismic hazard assessment in terms of ground acceleration were calculated for the territory of Georgia. On the basis of obtained area seismic sources probabilistic seismic hazard maps were calculated showing peak ground acceleration (PGA) and spectral accelerations (SA) at 0.2, 1sec periods for 10% probability and 2% probability in 50 years using selected GMPEs correspondingly for Rock (Vs=760m/s) and soil (Vs=300m/s).\nSeismic hazard calculation have been performed with two software OpenQuake and EZFRISK. Bothe of them gave us equal value of seismic hazard for Georgia.",

            "abstract": "Metamorphic processes in the Earth crust are almost invariably associated with fluid migration. Many lines of evidence suggest that fluid migration is intimately coupled both to the metamorphic reactions, and to associated deformation processes. Petrologic arguments suggest that all granulite facies and most amphibolite facies rocks are essentially dry (no free fluid phase) at normal geothermal gradients outside periods of heating-produced fluid generation. In addition, except at high pressure - low temperature condition, fluid-consuming reactions leads to an increase in solid volume and a potential clogging of any initial pore space. Hence, fluid migration in medium and high-grade metamorphic rocks is in general associated with some porosity producing process.\nPorosity generation may occur by either chemical or mechanical processes. In systems with high fluid fluxes, porosity may be produced by dissolution and transport of mass out of the system. Such fluxes can normally only be sustained over short length scales and limited time scales. In systems where the infiltrating fluid is far from equilibrium with the rock matrix, mechanical porosity generation can arise from local stresses generated by the volume change of volatilization reactions. Furthermore, it has become increasingly clear that crustal rocks may be under significant tectonic stress, even far from plate tectonic boundaries. In situations where the rocks are close to critically stressed, any stress perturbations caused by reaction driven changes in solid volume or fluid pressure gradients may lead to dilatant deformation and porosity production on a scale much larger than the characteristic length scales of the reacting rock units. Field observations, experimental studies and modeling results will be presented that focus on reaction driven porosity generation in systems subject to variable initial differential stresses.",

            "abstract": "Several new tools to reconstruct past temperatures with stalagmites have recently emerged, which we have compared for the first time using stalagmites from Northern Borneo (4.1°N, 114.9°E). Temperatures were inferred from 1) the partitioning of oxygen isotopes between fluid inclusion water and calcite (Dublyansky and Spötl, 2009, RCM), 2) the density of fluid inclusion water determined by liquid-vapor homogenization (Krüger et al., 2011, Chemical Geology), 3) noble gas concentrations in fluid inclusions (Vogel et al., 2013, G3), and 4) the carbonate isotopologue (or ‘clumped isotope’) composition of the calcite (Eiler, 2011, QSR). The temperature sensitivity of two of the proxies, fluid inclusion δ18O and clumped isotopes, is currently debated. The results of this study contribute also to these ongoing debates. We furthermore compare two different methods for measuring the isotopic composition of fluid inclusion water, namely isotope ratio mass spectrometry and cavity ring-down spectroscopy.\nStalagmite WR5 used for this study covers two glacial-interglacial cycles, from Marine Isotope Stage 12 to the beginning of Marine Isotope Stage 9 (460-330 ka). The sample has previously been used to infer past changes in precipitation (Meckler et al., 2012, Science). In addition to this old stalagmite we analyzed two recent samples in order to compare proxy data to measured cave temperatures. Within error, all methods yielded consistent temperature estimates and the results from the recent samples are in agreement with the modern cave temperature. We used the equation of Tremaine et al. (2011, GCA) for calculating temperatures from fluid inclusion δ18O and a new clumped isotope calibration obtained at ETH, based on synthetic calcites (Ziegler et al., in prep.). The results from WR5 suggest 4-5 °C temperature difference between the glacials and interglacials contained in our record, which is similar to the amplitude of reconstructed regional sea surface temperature records (e.g., de Garidel-Thoron et al., 2005, Nature) when considering sealevel-driven glacial-interglacial changes in cave elevation.",

Independently adjusting the partial water vapor pressure in the sample chamber and the temperature of the substrate mounted on top of the double-stage Peltier element, deposition ice nucleation, growth, and sublimation can be studied within the temperature range from -5°C to -60°C. By using small crystal size and tilted geometry we have been able to record the video sequences of ice nucleation taking place on both 001 and 010 crystallographic planes simultaneously.\nHere, we report the following general features of ice nucleation and growth observed in these experiments:\nNucleation of ice always starts before the water saturation is reached.\nIce was preferentially nucleating on surface defects (steps, cracks, and pits) or on the debris particles scattered over the surface of feldspar crystal.\nIce crystals grown via deposition at temperatures above -30°C on any of the feldspar crystal faces have shown the same directional and rotational orientation, with c-axis of ice aligned with the c-axis of microcline unit cell. Below -35°C no preferential orientation has been observed whatsoever.\nThe majority of observed ice crystals exhibit the evaporation groove at the waist of hexagonal prism, indicting the presence of lattice dislocations in the crystal nucleation plane.\nWe discuss a possible mechanism of crystal lattice alignment by considering layer of ordered water on the surface of feldspar crystal forming prior to ice nucleation. Using density functional theory we show how the mineral surface interacts with water, particularly addressing the interaction of surface cations and hydroxyl groups with a water overlayer. We argue that the misalignment of the 001 lattice planes for microcline and ice (inherently following from the alignment of their c-axis) should favor the stacking disorder of ice lattice in the nucleation plane, the feature we observe as an “evaporation groove” in the majority of the aligned ice crystals. Finally, we discuss the implications of the observed phenomenon for the understanding of ice nucleation mechanism on the atmospheric mineral dust particles.",

However, application of classical nucleation theory to the cold conditions of the polar summer mesopause comprises large uncertainties giving rise to strongly variant model predictions of PMC formation. To reduce these uncertainties laboratory measurements of nucleation and growth rates are required.\nWe use an electrodynamic trap to investigate the nucleation and growth of water vapor on singly charged sub-3nm MSP analogues in the laboratory under mesospheric conditions typical during PMC growth initiation. The particles are created in a microwave plasma particle source and stored in a quadrupole ion trap under mesospheric pressure and temperature, where they are subjected to the high supersaturation necessary for nucleation and growth on nanometer sized particles. The particle mass and mass change by water accretion is monitored with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer as a function of residence time under supersaturated conditions.\nIn this contribution we present for the first time measurements of nucleation and growth rates of water vapor on MSP analogues with an initial radius between 1.5nm and 3 nm.

Gravity waves propagating upward cause a cooling of this region leading to temporary supersaturated conditions during which heterogeneous nucleation of CO2 can take place. Large uncertainties in describing the nucleation processes at the extreme conditions of the Martian mesopause region state the need of laboratory measurements.\nSub-3 nanometer radius meteor smoke particle (MSP) analogues are created in a microwave plasma and stored in an electrodynamic trap for examining CO2 ice nucleation as well as growth rates at low particle temperatures between 60 K and 75 K and CO2 concentrations up to 1017 m-3 which are reasonably close to conditions present in the Martian mesosphere. Ice nucleation and growth processes of the particles are examined by analyzing the mass distribution of the particles with a time of flight spectrometer as a function of the residence time under supersaturated conditions.\nIn this paper, first measurements of CO2 ice nucleation and growth on iron oxide and silicate particles will be presented. These results are extrapolated to realistic Martian conditions reducing the large uncertainty in dealing with CO2 ice nucleation on MSPs.",

            "abstract": "Climate change projections are characterised by large uncertainties with rainfall variability being the key challenge in designing adaptation policies. Climate change adaptation in water resources shows all the typical characteristics of 'wicked' problems typified by cognitive uncertainty as new scientific knowledge becomes available, problem instability, knowledge imperfection and strategic uncertainty due to institutional changes that inevitably occur over time. Planning that is characterised by uncertainties and instability requires an approach that can accommodate flexibility and adaptive capacity for decision-making. An ability to take corrective measures in the event that scenarios and responses envisaged initially derive into forms at some future stage.\nWe present an integrated-multidisciplinary and comprehensive framework designed to interface and inform science and decision making in the formulation of water resource management strategies to deal with climate change in the Musi Catchment of Andhra Pradesh, India. At the core of this framework is a dialogue between stakeholders, decision makers and scientists to define a set of plausible responses to an ensemble of climate change scenarios derived from global climate modelling. The modelling framework used to evaluate the resulting combination of climate scenarios and adaptation responses includes the surface and groundwater assessment models (SWAT & MODFLOW) and the water allocation modelling (REALM) to determine the water security of each adaptation strategy. Three climate scenarios extracted from downscaled climate models were selected for evaluation together with four agreed responses—changing cropping patterns, increasing watershed development, changing the volume of groundwater extraction and improving irrigation efficiency. Water security in this context is represented by the combination of level of water availability and its associated security of supply for three economic activities (agriculture, urban, industrial) on a spatially distributed basis. The resulting combinations of climate scenarios and adaptation responses were subjected to a combined hydro-economic assessment based on the degree of water security together with its cost-effectiveness against the Business-as-usual scenario.",

            "abstract": "Ground-Based Augmentation Systems (GBAS) support aircraft precision approach and landing by broadcasting differential Global Positioning System (GPS) corrections and integrity information to aviation users. Under anomalous ionospheric condition, unacceptably large residual errors can occur due to anomalously large ionospheric spatial decorrelation, and this can pose integrity threats to GBAS users. Thus, the development of an ionospheric anomaly threat model is required to simulate worst-case ionospheric errors and develop mitigation strategies. Ionosphere in low latitudes is known to be much more intense than that in mid latitudes due to active geomagnetic effect, and investigation of low latitude ionospheric anomalies must take precedence before operation of GBAS.\nIn this paper, ionospheric spatial decorrelation is investigated for GBAS operation in the Brazilian region. Dual-frequency observation data are collected from Brazilian GPS reference stations. This analysis is performed using data sets collected on scintillating days, less-scintillating days, and storm days from 2012 to 2014. Precise ionospheric spatial gradient on the L1 signal is automatically estimated from dual-frequency observation data using simple truth method and station pair method. In the Brazilian region, however, intense ionospheric scintillations cause a large numbers of cycle slips in carrier-phase data. The simple truth process removes a considerably large number of those data through short-arc and outlier removals, and thus potential ionospheric gradients may not be detected. This motivates a data recovery process which skips short-arc and outlier removals if there appears a large ionospheric spatial gradient in the removed data. We also use a series of methods to validate anomalous ionospheric spatial gradients using manual validation with L1 single frequency measurement, station-wide check, satellite-wide check, and time-step check. In particular, the time-step check validates localized ionospheric anomalies in a scale of several tens of kilometers. This method is useful when the anomalies are not validated by station-wide and satellite-wide checks due to the sparse distribution of Brazilian GPS reference stations. Using the above methods, we observe and validate large ionospheric spatial gradients.",

            "abstract": "Soil erosion in cultivated land is one of the main critical issue because of its significant economic consequences, especially whether it occurs in hilly and mountainous environments. Among the cultivated lands, vineyards deserve a particular attention. In fact, they not only represent one of the most important crop in terms of income and employment, but they also constitute the form of agricultural land use that causes the highest soil loss. In these cultivated lands, the construction of terraces is one of the most widely used system for soil and water conservation measures. However, while favoring agricultural activities, terraces may cause local instabilities as well, if they are not properly maintained. Terraced fields are also served by agricultural roads and the construction of these anthropogenic features can have deep effects on water flows and instabilities. In fact, the plane surface of roads can intercept the overland and the subsurface flow and can modify the natural flow directions expanding the drainage network.\nThe main objective of this work is to use high-resolution topography derived from lidar technology for a hydro-geomorphological analysis of terraced vineyards. We considered few case studies located in Italy. At first, the Relative Path Impact Index (RPII) is used to identify likely sections of terraces and agricultural roads subject to potential landsliding or erosion. Statistical thresholds of RPII are then defined to label the most critical areas. Afterwards, using the index and the defined thresholds, different scenarios of soil conservation measures are simulated, to establish the optimal solution for erosion reduction. The results prove the effectiveness of high-resolution topography in the analysis of surface erosion in terraced vineyards, when the surface water flow is the main factor triggering the instabilities. This preliminary analysis can help in scheduling a suitable planning to mitigate the consequences of the anthropogenic alterations induced by the terraces and agricultural roads.\nTarolli, P., Sofia, G., Calligaro, S., Prosdocimi, M., Preti, F., Dalla Fontana, G.

These structures form via the interaction of magnetic depletions and the local electron population in the plasma. They are characterised by local depressions in the magnetic field strength with circular cross-sections. We use PIC and test particle simulations to show that the magnetic structure is maintained by a current carried by an electron vortex which is due to a population of electrons with pitch angles close to 90 degrees in trapped, or quasi-trapped, non-adiabatic orbits. We then compare these results to Cluster observations of electron-scale magnetic holes (MH) in the Earth's plasma sheet. MHs in the solar wind are often explained in terms of the mirror mode instability. Here, in the plasma sheet, we show MH events in mirror stable environments, with high electron perpendicular temperature anisotropy, which cannot be explained in terms of a standard mirror mode growth. We show that EVMHs may provide a theoretical explanation for a majority of the MHs observed in the plasma sheet at scales less than the proton thermal gyroradius.",

            "abstract": "We have collected data on magma eruption rate, which is one of the most fundamental parameters for a volcanic eruption. There are several compilations on eruption rates, for example, for Plinian eruptions (Carey and Sigurdsson, 1989), basaltic eruptions (Wadge, 1981), lava dome eruptions (Newhall and Melson, 1983), and all combined (Tomiya and Koyaguchi, 1998; Pyle, 2000). However, they did not quantitatively discuss the effects of magma viscosity, which must control eruption rates.\nHere, we discuss the effects of magma viscosity on eruption rates, by using 'preeruptive magma viscosities', which are important measures of magma eruptibility (Takeuchi, 2011). Preeruptive magma viscosity is the viscosity of magma (melt, dissolved water, and crystals) in the magma chamber at the preeruptive conditions, and can be approximately obtained only by the bulk rock SiO2 and phenocryst content, using an empirical formula (Takeuchi, 2010).\nWe have found some interesting relationships, such as (1) eruption styles and rates are correlated to preeruptive magma viscosity but not correlated to bulk rock composition, and (2) the gap (ratio) in eruption rates between explosive and effusive phases in a series of eruptions is proportional to preeruptive magma viscosity. We also propose, by combining (1) and (2), that (3) the radius (or width) of volcanic conduit is positively correlated with preeruptive magma viscosity.\nOur data also show that the eruptive magmas are divided into two types. One is the low-viscosity type (basalt ~ phenocryst-poor andesite), characterized by lava flow and sub-Plinian eruptions. The other is the high-viscosity type (phenocryst-rich andesite ~ rhyolite), characterized by lava dome and Plinian eruptions. The boundary is at about 104 Pa s. These two types may be closely linked to the magma generation processes (fractional/batch crystallization vs. extraction from a mushy magma chamber).",

            "abstract": "Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) play important roles as key intermediates in the anaerobic metabolism of subsurface microbial communities. Usually they are present in marine sediment pore water in low concentrations as a result of balanced production and consumption, both occurring in the same sediment zone. Thus their low concentrations represent a steady state condition regulated by either thermodynamics or kinetics. We have developed a novel analytical approach for the parallel measurement of several VFAs directly from marine pore water without any sample pretreatment by the use of a 2-dimensional ion chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. In a first study we analyzed acetate, formate, and propionate in pore water from sediment cores retrieved from 5 different stations within and offshore of the Godhåbsfjord (Greenland). The sediment cores represent different sedimentological conditions, ranging from a typical marine sedimentation site to a glacier/freshwater dominated site. In addition to VFA concentrations, we measured sulfate concentrations, sulfate reduction rates, and cell abundances. We calculated the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) available for sulfate reduction (SR), as well as the VFA turnover times by the in-situ SR rates. The turnover time for acetate by SR ranged from several hours to days in the top cm of sediment and increased to several hundred years at the bottom of the SR zone. From the associated cell abundances we calculated that the VFA turnover times were significantly longer than the diffusion times of the VFA between individual cells. This shows that VFA consumption in the SR zone, and concomitantly the observed pore water concentrations, are not constrained by diffusion. DG values for SR using acetate were >36 kJ/mol which is significantly above the lower limit for anaerobic microbial energy metabolism. It thus remains unclear what controls the VFA concentrations in the sediment.",

            "abstract": "On 1 April 2014, the Pisagua earthquake ruptured the northern portion of the north Chilean seismic gap that remained devoid of large seismic events in the previous 137 years. The W-phase inversion yields an almost purely double-couple solution consistent with Global CMT and the local slab geometry. This event was preceded by two weeks of intense foreshock activity and followed by a large Mw=7.7 aftershock. In this study, we estimate the detailed rupture process of the mainshock using ALTAR: an innovative Bayesian sampler that is now implemented to run on GPU and allows sampling of posterior PDFs for high-dimensional problems. Our observations include InSAR, high-rate GPS and Tsunami data. We include a full data covariance matrix to account for measurement uncertainties and prediction error. This covariance model enables a physical basis for the relative weighting between available datasets and provides more realistic estimates of uncertainty on the inferred parameters. Our results indicate a compact slip zone located down dip of the hypocenter. The absence of shallow rupture is mainly controlled by tsunami observations. In the same way, the 1995 Antofagasta and the 2001 Arequipa earthquakes did not involve any slip near the trench. Using land-based geodetic data, it is fundamentally difficult to know if shallow portions of the north Chilean subduction zone are seismogenic or not. Therefore, as for the 2011 Tohoku event, we cannot exclude the occurrence of a major event rupturing the southern portion of the seismic gap and driving slip at shallow depth.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that direct evidence of earthquakes within fault zones is limited to the presence of pseudotachylyte. In addition to pseudotachylyte, previous studies have shown that the meso- and microstructural features of cataclastic veins that lack the primary cohesion of the host rocks, including crush-origin pseudotachylyte, fault breccia, may represent primary evidence of brittle deformation caused by recurrent seismic slip within shallow seismogenic fault zones (e.g., Lin, 1996, 2008).\nIn this presentation, we report on the structural mode of typical ultracataclastic veins including pseudotachylyte and fault gouge veins that formed repeatedly as simple veins and complex networks at shallow depth within two main active fault zones along the Arima-Takatsuki Tectonic Line (ATTL) and the Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line (ISTL), Japan. Multistage veinlet cataclastic rocks, composed of aphanitic veins typical of pseudotachylyte and unconsolidated fault gouge, breccias, as complex networks along the main active fault zones. Early veins are generally fractured and overprinted by younger veins, indicating that vein-forming events occurred repeatedly within the same fault shear zone. Microstructurally, both the pseudotachylyte and fault gouge veins are characterized by a superfine- to fine-grained matrix and angular-subangular fragments ranging in size from submicron scale to several centimeters. Based on the meso- and microstructural features of veinlet ultracataclastic rocks and the results of powder X-ray diffraction analyses, we conclude that (i) the pseudotachylyte veins were generated mainly by crushing rather than melting at shallow fault zones, and (ii) multistage veinlet fault gouge and pseudotachylyte formed repeatedly within the fault-fracture zone via the rapid fluidization and injection of superfine- to fine-grained materials derived from the host rocks during large-magnitude earthquakes that occurred along the active fault zones within the ATTL and ISTL. Our results show that the fluidized ultracataclastic veins record paleoseismic faulting events that occurred at shallow seismogenic fault zones; consequently, these features are a type of earthquake fossil, as is melt-origin pseudotachylyte.",

            "abstract": "The site-specific relationship between EO indicators and actual crop yields has been explored in many different studies, describing semi-empirical regression models between spatially aggregated biophysical parameters or vegetation indices and observed yields (from field measurements or official statistics). However, when considering larger extensions –from countries to continents– agro-climatic conditions and crop management may differ substantially among regions, and these differences may greatly influence the relationship between biophysical indicators and the observed yields, which may be also driven by limiting factors other than green biomass formation.\nThe present study aims to better assess the contribution of EO indicators within an operational crop yield forecasting system in Europe and neighbouring countries, by evaluating how these above mentioned geographic differences influence the relationship between biophysical indicators and crop yield. We therefore explore, as a first step, the correspondence between fAPAR time-series (1999-2013) and the inter-annual yield variability of wheat, barley and grain maize, at sub-national level across Europe (270-450 Administrative Units, depending on crop). In a second step, we map the agro-climatic contexts in which EO indicators better explain the observed yield inter-annual variability, identify the influence of some meteorological events on the fAPAR -yield relationship and provide some recommendations for further investigation.\nThe results indicate that in water-limited environments (e.g. Mediterranean and Black Sea areas), fAPAR is highly correlated with yields whereas in northern Europe, crop yield appears much less limited by leaf area expansion along the season, and the relationship between yield and EO products becomes more difficult to interpret.",

            "abstract": "Active continental margin like the Ryukyu arc-trench system poses high tsunami risk, which however remains poorly assessed due to the sparse historic records and geological studies. In order to better understand the tsunami risk in northern Taiwan of the southernmost Ryukyu active margin, borehole cores of the Jinshan Coastal Plain were investigated for the tsunami deposits of 1867 event and possibly its precursors.\nBased on facies characteristics, two decimeter-thick marine event sand beds are identified intercalated with the fluvial gravelly deposit that has been accumulated in a microtidal barred estuary over the past millennium. Distributed all over the coastal plain except the coastal sand spits, the fluvial deposit are predominantly sourced from the Pleistocene arc andesite, and thus commonly reddish in color due to the high iron content. The marine beds are rich in quartz sand and granule, whitish gray in color, and rounded to subangular in grain shape, indicating a sediment source from the coastal sand spits which receive longshore drift from the nearby rocky coasts dominated by the Oligocene and Miocene quartzose sandstone and mudstone. The facies succession of marine bed is characterized by erosion base, planar lamination, normal grading, soft-sediment deformation, and variations in magnetic susceptibility, Si, K, Ti, and Fe. The succession reflects the sedimentary processes from incoming wave erosion, rapid marine deposition, backflow reworking, and suspension fall-out.\nThe marine beds are traceable landward based on the facies characteristics and C14 dating over a distance up to two kilometers before thinning out and grading into carbonaceous mud. According to the C14 dating, the two marine beds are linked to the 1867 tsunami and an earlier event in the late 17th century. Based on their ages and distributions, the two event beds further suggest two marine incursions of similar extant in an approximate recurrence interval of ~170 yr.",

            "abstract": "Hyporheic exchange (HE) is the mixing of stream and subsurface waters beneath the sediment-water interface (SWI). At the patch and reach scales, HE is dominated by periodic upwelling and downwelling zones, induced by pressure variation and processes within the turbulent boundary layer (TBL). This can be caused by (1) the geometry of the stream, imposing a stationary wave at the SWI or (2) by a travelling wave associated with the propagation of turbulent pressure waves generated from the TBL. Case (1) has generally been the favoured model of hyporheic exchange and has been referred to as hyporheic ‘pumping’ by Elliott and Brooks, and subsequently others. Case (2) can be termed turbulent pumping, and has been proposed as a mechanism to model the combined effects of turbulent dispersion alongside steady-state advection. While this has been represented numerically and analytically, conjecture remains about the physical representation of these combined processes.\nWe present initial results from experiments undertaken to classify the spatial and temporal characteristics of pressure variation at and beneath the SWI, with a periodic sinusoidal geometry of wavelength 0.28m and height 0.02m. As an initial characterisation, the advective flow profile has been examined using time-lapse photography of dyes released across the span of a periodic downwelling zone. These tracer tests confirmed delineation of isolated upwelling and downwelling cells as noted by previous authors in modelling studies. However, their distribution deviates from the typical pumping pattern with increased discharge and stream gradient. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of high frequency (250Hz) pressure measurements, sampled at an array along the centroid of the flume underneath one wavelength gave further insight into the spatial distribution of turbulent signatures arising from roughness-generated turbulence. A turbulent frequency of 6-10Hz dominates, however the penetration depth appears to be limited by the advective pumping induced by bedforms in conjunction with the stream gradient. Our results experimentally support the combined presence of advective and turbulent pumping interacting with the hydraulic stream gradient in driving exchange across the SWI.",

            "abstract": "The Neoproterozoic stratigraphic record of South China contains distributed volcanic ash beds, which can be dated and used to provide a backbone for Cryogenian and Ediacaran ‘age models’. When integrated with geochemical and paleontological data, both locally and from other regions, these successions inform our understanding of environmental and biological change from these intervals. At present the South China stratigraphy provides the dates that best approximate the termination of the Marinoan glaciation (ca. 635 Ma, U-Pb single zircon isotope dilution1) from a dated volcanic ash bed that occurs in the cap carbonate sequence (Doushantuo Formation) which directly overlies the Nantuo Tillite (Marinoan glaciation equivalent). A number of other ash beds have been documented in both the Nantuo Tillite and throughout the Datangpo Formation (pre-Marinoan non-glacial succession) and have been variably dated using U-Pb microbeam and multi-grain isotope dilution studies2-4. These published data sets have produced dates that have uncertainties on the order of 4 Myr but are built upon single-analyses data points, which have uncertainties on the order of 10 Myr or greater thereby limiting their utility for assessing temporal relationship with other dated section. We present new U-Pb single zircon isotope dilution geochronology data from a suite of samples from the Datangpo, Nantuo and Doushantuo Formations. New dates from the base of the Datangpo Formation confirm a ca. 660 Ma end to the Sturtian glacial epoch, which is represented by underlying glacial deposits. Additional dates from ash beds from the Datangpo Formation and the lower Nantuo Tillite will refine the duration of the Cryogenian non-glacial interlude and Marinoan glaciation as recorded in South China. Combined with published data from Namibia, Australia and Canada, these new data will permit the development of a more highly resolved age model for the Cryogenian, enabling estimation of duration and synchronicity of proxy records. They will also provide further tests and input data for numerical models that seek to simulate Cryogenian climate drivers and responses.\n1. D. Condon et al., (2005) Science308, 95; 2. C. M.

            "abstract": "In principle sunlit leaves can maintain their temperatures within a narrower range than ambient temperatures. This is an important and long-known (but now overlooked) prediction of energy balance theory. Net radiation at leaf surface in steady state (which is reached rapidly) must be equal to the combination of sensible and latent heat exchanges with surrounding air, the former being proportional to leaf-to-air temperature difference (ΔT), the latter to the transpiration rate. We present field measurements of ΔT which confirm the existence of a ‘crossover temperature’ in the 25-30˚C range for species in a tropical savanna and a tropical rainforest environment. This finding is consistent with a simple representation of transpiration as a function of net radiation and temperature (Priestley-Taylor relationship) assuming an entrainment factor (ω) somewhat greater than the canonical value of 0.26. The fact that leaves in tropical forests are typically cooler than surrounding air, often already by solar noon, is consistent with a recently published comparison of MODIS day-time land-surface temperatures with air temperatures.\nTheory further predicts a strong dependence of leaf size (which is inversely related to leaf boundary-layer conductance, and therefore to absolute magnitude of ΔT) on moisture availability. Theoretically, leaf size should be determined by either night-time constraints (risk of frost damage to active leaves) or day-time constraints (risk of heat stress damage),with the former likely to predominate – thereby restricting the occurrence of large leaves – at high latitudes. In low latitudes, daytime maximum leaf size is predicted to increase with temperature, provided that water is plentiful. If water is restricted, however, transpiration cannot proceed at the Priestley-Taylor rate, and it quickly becomes advantageous for plants to have small leaves, which do not heat up much above the temperature of their surroundings.\nThe difference between leaf and air temperature is generally neglected in terrestrial ecosystem and carbon cycle models. This is a significant omission that could lead to an over-estimation of the heat-stress vulnerability of carbon uptake in the wet tropics. Leaf energy balance theory is well established, and should be included in the next generation of models.",

The residual mantle gravity anomalies are derived from the GOCE satellite gravity data, from which gravitational effects of the deep mantle and the crust are removed.\nWe take advantage of a recently released seismic model EUNAseis for the crustal structure of the European continent and the adjacent regions. We examine the propagation of crustal model uncertainties into determinations of lithospheric mantle density. Given a relatively small range of expected density variations in the lithospheric mantle, knowledge on the uncertainties associated with incomplete knowledge of density structure of the crust is of utmost importance for further progress in density heterogeneity studies.\nOur model of mantle density structure has lateral resolution of ca. 100 km, which allows to distinguish small-scale mantle anomalies and to link them to regional geodynamic processes. To understand better geodynamic causes of mantle density heterogeneity, we compare mantle residual gravity anomalies for the European upper mantle with regional upper mantle velocity structure constrained by high-resolution seismic tomography studies, and compare our regional upper mantle density model with petrological studies of mantle-derived xenoliths from the Baltic shield, the Arkhangelsk region, and worldwide.",

While this tool is adequate for first-order predictions of tephra deposition under no-wind conditions, the simplifying assumptions make it unreliable for ambient winds >10 m/s. Advances in computational power now make it possible to improve the inversion tool using 3D fluid dynamics. We do this with the physics-based Active Tracer High-resolution Atmospheric Model (ATHAM) to model tephra dispersion and deposition from volcanic eruption columns. The model, when run in 3D, is able to capture the complex morphology of bent plumes. Tephra distributions produced by these morphologies differ significantly from distributions created by idealized advection solutions, reflecting the effects of counter-rotating vortex pairs, puffing modes, or plume bifurcation. The modeled tephra deposition better captures the complex effects of wind-plume interaction, allowing us to update classic inversion tools with more realistic weak plume conditions consistent with typical historical explosive eruptions.",

            "abstract": "Increased seismicity in recent years in some geologically quiescent regions in the US has been linked to wastewater injection associated with oil and gas production. While seismicity in some cases appears to be well correlated with injection activities, in many other injection locations no seismicity has been reported. How pore pressures generated from injection propagate spatially and evolve temporally is likely a key control in inducing earthquakes, providing a physical linkage between injection activity and seismicity occurrence. Yet, the linkage remains controversial and inconclusive, in spite of the basic physics of pore pressure propagation being well established. This study aims at better understanding the physical processes of pore pressure propagation around injection sites and identifying factors that are most likely contributors to induced seismicity.\nNumerical modeling suggests that pore pressure increases in the Jones seismicity swarm northeast of Oklahoma City were primarily from several high rate injection wells. Preliminary analysis on injection and seismicity data from Greeley, Colorado also points to a potential pore pressure link between high injection rates and seismicity. Modeling of pore pressures in the Lake County, Ohio, illustrates that permeable faults in the crystalline basement could facilitate pore pressure propagation from injection in the basal aquifer and host earthquakes, which could explain the earthquakes that occurred in the mid-1980s. In many of the above examples, wastewater injection in basal aquifers promoted downward propagation of pore pressures into the crystalline basement.\nIn connecting injection and seismicity through pore pressure propagation, high rate injection wells and permeable basement faults are merging as important players contributing to induced seismicity. It is the intention of this study that findings like these would provide a scientific basis to inform future regulations and policies on wastewater injection.",

During the Early Eocene (~55 Ma to 45 Ma) the δ34S composition increased from 18‰ to 22‰ and has remained largely invariant over the last 34 Ma. The two principal hypotheses that are invoked to explain this positive Eocene excursion: (1) a rapid increase in the flux of weathering-derived sulfate and an increase in sulfate concentrations, coupled with a compensatory increase in pyrite burial, or (2) an increase volume of anoxic waters and enhanced increase in pyrite burial. A clear understanding of this significant change in seawater chemistry is hampered by the relatively low temporal resolution of barite δ34S data during this period, and potential problems with the preservation of carbonate associated sulfate signals. Here we focus on increasing the temporal resolution δ34S isotope curve through this excursion using carbonate-associated sulfate data from IODP Expedition 342, Newfoundland Drifts, and ODP Leg 207, Demerara Rise. Initial data largely confirm the magnitude and timing of change observed in the barite δ34S records. Additionally, to better constrain the fidelity of CAS-derived δ34S values, we will present pore-water sulfate δ34S data sampled from Expedition 342 sediments.",

We observed hysteresis in the high-frequency (5-15 Hz) seismic noise level relative to the associated hydrological parameters. In addition, our seismic noise analysis reveals an asymmetry and a high coherence in noise cross-correlation functions for several station pairs during the typhoon passage, which likely corresponds to sediment particles impacting along the riverbed where the river bends sharply. Comparison of sediment flux between seismologically determined bedload and derived suspended load indicates temporal changes in the sediment flux ratio, which imply a complex transition process from the bedload regime to the suspension regime and/or a difference in the amount of climate-controlled hillslope mass wasting into the fluvial system between typhoon passage and off-typhoon periods.",

            "abstract": "Since the discovery of diamonds in kimberlite-type rocks more than a century ago, a number of theories regarding the processes involved in kimberlite emplacement have been put forward to explain the unique properties of kimberlite magmatism. Geological data suggests that pre-existing lithosphere weakness zones may control the spatial patterns of kimberlites, but this hypothesis has never been tested by geophysical methods. As the first step in our analysis of tectonic and lithosphere control of kimberlite-type magmatism, we perform a detailed global analysis of the spatial patterns of kimberlites, and present the first results. The analysis is based on the assumption that the kimberlite emplacement is a two-stage process, and the two stages are controlled by the crustal and lithospheric mantle rheologies, respectively. Stage 1 includes the first-order, lithosphere-scale process that initiate the rise of kimberlite melts through the lithospheric mantle, which forms the major pipe. Stage 2 (second-order process) begins when the major pipe splits into daughter sub-pipes (tree-like pattern) at crustal depths. We apply cluster analysis to the spatial distribution of all known kimberlite fields with the goal of establishing characteristic scales for the stage 1 and stage 2 processes. The results indicate that characteristic scales for the stage 2 are almost globally uniform and thus are almost independent of the structure and the mantle lithosphere. In contrast, the characteristic scales for stage 1 vary over very broad limits and are, apparently controlled, by the past structure of the lithosphere and a “vigor” of lithosphere-mantle interaction, which caused kimberlite emplacements.",

            "abstract": "The ~1.16 Ga Ilímaussaq Complex is famous for the strikingly layered kakortokites at the base of the intrusion, which host a world class rare-earth, Zr, Nb and Ta deposit. Within the kakortokites are unlayered fine-grained mesocratic rocks, which have variously been described as lujavrite, unlayered kakortokite and ‘hybrids’. The most recent and commonly accepted hypothesis suggests they formed through slumping of kakortokite mush [1]. None of these hypotheses, however, fully explain all the textural, mineralogical and chemical features of these rocks.\nThe mineralogy does not match lujavrite or kakortokite, instead phenocrysts of euhedral augite are present and aenigmatite can form up to 35% of the rock; minerals rarer in kakortokite or lujavrite. This mineralogy indicates that these rocks were formed from a more primitive, relatively Ti-rich magma. These data are inconsistent with the unlayered mesocratic rocks forming solely from the kakortokites; instead the contacts typically resemble textures of magma mingling, with the development of vein networks and pillows with crenulated margins (Fig. 1). Thus we prefer the name provided by Ferguson [2] of hybrids to best describe these rocks.\nInjection of primitive magmas into the chamber during the formation of the kakortokites indicates the dynamic nature of the Ilímaussaq magma chamber. It could not have simply undergone a single stage-filling event; instead batches of magma of varying composition must have been intruded during its history. The hybrids represent one of these batches of magma after undergoing AFC processes.\nFig 1: (a) Hybrid rocks cross-cut the layering of the kakortokites, person for scale.

Sufficiently high level of Alfvenic turbulence is needed for the fast acceleration of particles in shocks driven by coronal mass ejections in solar wind. However, the turbulence level observed in association with SEP events is highly intermittent, which may be essential for the particle emission to upstream of the shock or back to the Sun. Several model cases are considered to illustrate how the pre-existing solar wind structures can affect the acceleration and escape of solar energetic ions.  The model includes both the shock acceleration and the stochastic re-acceleration by the shock-amplified turbulence with account for the turbulence attenuation caused by the particle re-acceleration.

            "abstract": "Current effects on waves (CEW) have been recognized to play an essential role in attenuating offshore extent of rip currents (e.g., Haas et al., 1999; Yu and Slinn, 2003; Weir et al., 2011). This mechanism is presumed to be responsible for morphological processes of sandy beaches. The present study aims at analyzing influence of CEW on the evolution of rip channel system due to deformation of an alongshore-uniform barred topography. We exploit a phase-averaged barotropic numerical model based on ROMS with an Eulerian-averaged vortex force formalism (McWilliams et al., 2004) coupled with a refraction wave model (ROMS-WEC; Uchiyama et al., 2009; 2010). An empirical total sediment load model of Soulsby and Van Rijn (1997) with a diffusive downslope transport effect (e.g., Garnier et al., 2008) is implemented for evaluating sediment transport and associated morphological evolution.\nThe coupled, wave-current-sediment model successfully reproduces development of the alongshore periodic rip channel topography with normal incident offshore waves. The initial alongshore-uniform barred topography evolves into a rhythmic rip channel system through intrinsic instability triggered by a small disturbance. We then exhibit the rip current reduction by CEW on an immobile single barred beach with equally spaced rip channels. Among the other CEW such as the Doppler shift and wave set-down/up, wave refraction on currents is found to be most important in modifying the wavenumber field and breaker dissipation, leading to a systematic modulation in the diagnostic momentum balance. We further demonstrate that CEW has the first-order effect on the morphological processes where the resultant rip channel spacing is elongated 25-50% as compared to the case without CEW. In particular, CEW is crucial in widening the rip channel spacing, shoaling the rip channel in the surfzone, and shrinking submerged crescent mounds in the offshore beneath rip heads.",

One poorly understood element in dealing with volcanic-affected basins is assessing the impact magmatism has on the elements of the petroleum system. Within this study we attempt to evaluate the potential impact that the extensive sequence of igneous intrusions of the Faroe–Shetland Basin may have on hydrocarbon migration. Using available well data combined with regional 3D seismic surveys, we show that geometrical relationships between sills location and overlying hydrocarbons shows, together with several cases of gas-charged open fractures in the sills, point toward the recognition of igneous intrusions as a factor in hydrocarbon migration through sill intrusions acting as both barriers or conduits to hydrocarbon migration. We also provide a series of general conceptual models dealing with hydrocarbon migration and igneous compartmentalization within sedimentary basins, which can be applied not just to the Faroe–Shetland Basin, but to other sedimentary basins worldwide if it is found (via well data or other methods) that the intrusions are interacting with a petroleum system.",

This might be important encouraging evidence but, by no means, can be a “helpful” additive to statistics of a rigid testing that determines reliability and efficiency of a farecast/prediction method.\nUsually, earthquake prediction is classified in respect to expectation time while overlooking term-less identification of earthquake prone areas, as well as spatial accuracy. The forecasts are often made for a “cell” or “seismic region” whose area is not linked to the size of target earthquakes. This might be another source for making a wrong choice in parameterization of an forecast/prediction method and, eventually, for unsatisfactory performance in a real-time application.\nSumming up, prediction of time and location of an earthquake of a certain magnitude range can be classified into categories listed in the Table below –",

A credible seismic velocity model is essential for the Japan region as a means to comprehend the complexity of the tectonic setting, further our understanding of earthquake source mechanics and benefit seismic hazard assessment as well as early warning systems.\nThe study area covers the Japanese islands, Taiwan, Korean peninsula, easternmost parts of China and Russia, Sakhalin and the majority of the Kuril Islands chain. The domain extends down into the mantle transition zone. We choose 58 earthquakes of magnitudes Mw5.0 – 6.9 distributed across the model domain as uniformly as possible. The data are obtained from several seismic networks in the area, namely F-net in Japan, BATS in Taiwan, South Korean National Earthquake Network and several stations from each China National Seismic Network, New China Digital Seismograph Network, Global Seismograph Network and Korean Seismic Network made available by IRIS Data Management Center.\nTo facilitate full waveform inversion we use the spectral element method (SEM), which comes with the geometric flexibility of the finite-elements method and the accuracy of the spectral methods. Owing to the SEM and the advance in High Performance Computing we are able to perform numerical simulations of seismic waves in realistic 3D heterogeneous visco-elastic structures. Differences between the calculated and the real waveforms are quantified using the time-frequency misfits (Fichtner et al., 2008), which allow us to explore the temporal evolution of the frequency content of the data with no need to identify specific seismic phases. We use adjoint methods as an effective means to obtain sensitivity kernels and ultimately gradients, required for iterative gradient-based minimisation techniques. With such a methodology we are able to explain the data of dominant period as low as 10 s.\nThe final results of this study will contribute to the ‘Comprehensive Earth Model’ being developed by the Computational Seismology group at ETH with the aim to represent the snapshot of the current knowledge of the Earth’s internal visco-elastic structure.",

Recent studies indicate that EMIC waves are found even when theres is no such corresponding sources confirmed along the magnetic flux tube. In this study, we investigate how EMIC waves are generated differentially by external sources in the inhomogeneous magnetosphere by adopting the simulation models [e.g., Kim et al., 2008] as well as their corresponding analytical calculations (IIM: Invariant Imbedding Method) in an exact manner. Our results are as follows: 1) the presence of EMIC waves in the inner magnetosphere is mainly controlled by time-dependent characteristics of the sources, 2) if there are relatively rapid variations comparable to the ion gyro periods, even during the very short interval, it is well confirmed to observe the generation of EMIC waves, 3) if the source variation is assumed to be of arbitrary shapes, we found that the EMIC waves tend to occur more frequently together with MHD waves such as field line resonances rather than the isolated EMIC events, and 4) the EMIC occurrences with relatively large amplitude are strongly associated with the local inhomogeneity profile in the sense that dominant field-aligned EMIC waves often appear at the frequencies corresponding to local multi-ion hybrid resonances near the low-latitude region. We present the details about this significant role of external sources for the EMIC excitation, and suggest how such sources are identified in realistic observations. ",

For the purpose of improving the climatic interpretation from ice core records, a monitoring of the isotopic composition δ18O and δD at several height levels (up to 13 meter) of near-surface water vapor, precipitation and snow in the first 0.5 cm surface layer has been conducted during three summers (2010-2012) at NEEM, NW Greenland.\nWe compare the observed water vapor isotopic composition with model outputs from three isotope-enabled general circulation models: LMDZiso, isoGSM, ECHAM-wiso. This allows us to benchmark the models and address effect of model resolution, effect of transport, effect of isotope parameterization, and representation of significant source region contributions.\nWe find for all models that the simulated isotopic value δD are significantly biased towards too enriched values. A bias, which is only partly explained by the air temperature. The simulated amplitude in d-excess variations is ~50% smaller than observed and the simulated average summer level is ~10‰ lower than in observations. Using back trajectories we observe water vapor of Arctic origin to have a high d-excess fingerprint. This fingerprint is not observed in the GCMiso simulations indicating a problem of simulating accurately the Arctic hydrological cycle.\n The bias in the simulated δD and d-excess water vapor is similar to the already-documented bias in the simulated δD and d-excess of Greenland ice core records. This suggests that if we improve the simulation of the water vapor isotopic composition we might also improve the simulation of the ice core isotope record.\n During periods between precipitation events, our data demonstrate parallel changes of δ18O and d-excess in surface snow and near-surface vapor. The changes in δ18O of the vapor are similar or larger than those of the snow δ18O. It is estimated using the CROCUS snow model that 6 to 20% of the surface snow mass is exchanged with the atmosphere. We suggest that, in-between precipitation events, changes in the surface snow isotopic composition are driven by synoptic changes in near-surface vapor isotopic composition. This suggests that the ice core isotope climate signal might be driven by both the water vapor and precipitation isotope signal.",

            "abstract": "Monthly total water storage anomaly (TWSA) data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission have been used in a number of studies to improve modelled hydrological water states via data assimilation or parameter calibration. To this end, data assimilation is usually implemented through ensemble Kalman filter/smoother (EnKF/S) approaches, in which the modelled water states are updated by column-integrated TWSA with the assumption that the errors are uncorrelated. However, due to the peculiar GRACE orbital geometry, measurement principle and processing chain, TWSA fields exhibit spatially correlated errors at all spatial scales, even after applying decorrelation filters and after aggregation. Two synthetic experiments are performed in this study to assess the influence of the spatially correlated errors of GRACE TWSA within an evolving data assimilation and calibration framework. Here, an EnKF method (Eicker et al., 2014) is used to adjust the water states of the Global Hydrology WaterGAP Model (WGHM) towards synthetic GRACE-like TWSA and, simultaneously, calibrate model parameters. 'True' and 'uncertain' model states are defined by interchanging the climate forcing input fields of WGHM. Then, synthetic TWSA data are contaminated by adding (i) spatially uncorrelated Gaussian random noise, and (ii) spatially correlated GRACE-like errors simulated by projecting correlated potential coefficient errors to (sub-) basin means of TWSA. Both synthetic data sets (TWSA signal + errors) are introduced in the EnKF, and the influence on the updated water storage values, fluxes and calibration parameters is assessed by comparing with the simulated 'truth'. Our results indicate significant influence of the spatially correlated errors mainly over small (sub-) basins with north-south spatial extensions.",

The MT profile extended 400 km roughly north-south across the northern Himalayan terrane, the Yarlung-Zangbo suture (YZS) and the Lhasa-Gangdise terrane (LGT). The electrical model (Figure 1.) obtained from MT two-dimensional nonlinear conjugate gradient (NLCG) inversion using TM-mode data alone. On the southern of profile two steeply north dipping electrical gradient belts (F1, F2) which extended to a depth of about 20 km were imaged. This might represent the faults belonged to YZS. Positive flower structures (F3, f1, f2, f3) were apparent on the central of profile and the main fault extended about 60 km. The model indicated that the upper crust of LGT was covered with a thick high resistivity overlay which extended to depths from 10 – 30km. The huge low resistivity bodies in middle and lower crust indicated the possibility of partial melt.\n*This research was supported by China Geological Survey (Grant No. 1212011120185), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. 2652014018) and SinoProbe-01-02.",

            "abstract": "Rapid progress in experimental, micro-analytical and textural analysis at the crystal scale has produced an unprecedented record of magmatic processes. However an obstacle to further progress is the lack of understanding of how mass, energy and momentum flux associated with crystal-rich, open-system events produces identifiable outcomes. Hence developing a physically-based understanding of magmatic systems linking micro-scale petrological observations with a physical template operating at the macro-scale presents a so-called “Grand Challenge.”\nThe essence of this challenge is that magmatic systems have characteristic length and feedback scales between those accessible by classical continuum and discrete methods. It has become increasingly obvious that the old-school continuum methods have limited resolution and power of explanation for multiphase (real) magma dynamics. This is, in part, because in crystal-rich systems the deformation is non-affine, and so the concept of constitutive behavior is less applicable and likely not even relevant, especially if one is interested in the emergent character of micro-scale processes. One expression of this is the cottage industry of proposing viscosity laws for magmas, which serves as “blunt force” de facto corrections for what is intrinsically multiphase behavior. Even in more fluid-rich systems many of these laws are not suitable for use in the very transport theories they aim to support.\nThe alternative approach is the discrete method, where multiphase interactions are explicitly resolved. This is a daunting prospect given the numbers of crystals in magmas. But perhaps all crystals don’t need to be modeled. I will demonstrate how discrete methods can recover critical state behavior, resolve crystal migration, the onset of visco-elastic behavior such as melt-present shear bands which sets the large-scale mixing volumes, some of the general morpho-dynamics that underlies purported rheological models, and transient controls on the emergence and dissipation of distinct thermodynamic states. As simulations with 106 – 107 crystals are now possible both the local, micro-scale crystal processes as well as the larger scale processes controlled by particle-particle-fluid interactions, can be simultaneously resolved.",

            "abstract": "In natural salt playa or in evaporation pools for the salt extraction industry, one can sometimes see surprising regular structures formed by ridges of salt. These ridges connect together to form a self-organized network of polygons one to two meters in diameter, which we call salt polygons. Here we propose a mechanism based on porous media convection of salty water in soil to explain the formation and the scaling of the salt polygons. Surface evaporation causes a steady upward flow of salty water, which can cause precipitation near the surface. A vertical salt gradient then builds up in the porous soil, with heavy salt-saturated water lying over the less salty source water. This can drive convection when a threshold is reached, given by a critical Rayleigh number of about 7. We suggest that the salt polygons are the surface expression of the porous medium convection, with salt crystallizing along the positions of the convective downwellings.\nTo study this instability directly, we developed a 2D analogue experiment using a Hele-Shaw cell filled with a porous medium saturated with a salt solution and heated from above. We perform a linear stability analysis of this system, and find that it is unstable to convection, with a most unstable wavelength that is set by a balance between salt diffusion and water evaporation. The Rayleigh number in our experiment is controlled by the particle size of our model soil, and the evaporation rate. We obtain results that scale with the observation of natural salt polygons. Using dye, we observe the convective movement of salty water and find downwelling convective plumes underneath the spots where surface salt ridges form, as shown in the attached figure.",

            "abstract": " Full waveform inversion suffers from non-uniqueness and non-linearity problems. By using kinematic property of wavefield rather than dynamic property, we can mitigate such problems because the phase is linear and robust (Kamei et al. 2013). For the phase-only inversion, several misfit functions were suggested. Bednar et al. (2007) compared the logarithmic phase-only inversion proposed by Shin and Min (2006) with the conventional phase-only inversion. On the other hand, Kamei et al. (2014) introduced another method that uses the exponential of phase by normalizing the wavefield with respect to the amplitude.\n In this study, we compare the aforementioned three phase-only inversion methods in the frequency domain: i) the logarithmic phase-only inversion, ii) the conventional phase-only inversion I (briefly conventional I method) that normalizes wavefield with respect to the amplitude variation, and iii) the conventional phase-only inversion II (briefly conventional II method) that replaces the amplitude of the modeled data with that of field data. In the cases of the logarithmic and conventional I methods, if the modeled signal function is close to 0 or becomes large, the gradients of the misfit function diverge to infinity or converge to 0, respectively. In contrast, the conventional II method does not suffer from these problems. For fair comparison, we removed extremely small or large values with Gaussian filtering to avoid the instability problem in the logarithmic and conventional I methods. In addition, we assumed that the phase of the field data is unwrapped to the same degree as the phase of the modeled data in all the cases. On the other hand, the logarithmic and conventional II methods require the additional assumption that amplitudes of the field data are the same as those of the modeled data. However, the conventional I method does not require such an assumption. Our numerical examples show that the conventional I method yields more robust and accurate results than the logarithmic and conventional II methods.\n Acknowledgements\n This work was supported by the Human Resources Development program (No. 20134010200510) of the KETEP grant funded by the Korean government MOTIE and by the “Development of Technology for CO2 Marine Geological Storage” grant funded by the MOF of Korea.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic aperture is one of the most important parameters to describe fluid flow in fractured rocks. Hydraulic apertures are typically determined indirectly by fluid flow experiments or hydraulic field tests based on the cubic law. Alternatively, there are different equations approximating an empirical relation between mechanical and hydraulic aperture. However, these methods most widely neglect mechanisms such as stress changes, where increasing stresses decrease the mechanical aperture and, therefore, also the effective hydraulic aperture.\nHence, the objective of the present study is to simulate fluid flow in a single fracture under loading/unloading conditions and validate the results with core flooding experiments. Core flooding data and X-ray CT scans (voxel size 0.5 x 0.5 x 1 mm) of a sandstone sample with a single fracture (measured mean aperture of around 0.1 mm) were obtained by laboratory experiments. The fluid flow simulations are performed by solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation by using a finite volume method. Input data are given by experimental flow rates, pressures, applied stress levels and CT images of the fracture. In addition, an error analysis is performed to establish confidence in results.\nResults of the validation exhibit significant effects of stress on aperture distribution such as channeling and stress-dependent fracture permeability. A significant stress sensitivity of hydraulic aperture compared to the mechanical aperture was found, which can be explained by roughness changes resulting from loading. Observations indicate that with increasing stress, changes in mechanical aperture are small, while changes in hydraulic aperture can be very large. Since previous equations for hydraulic aperture do not consider changes in normal stress, a modification of these equations is proposed, including the stress-dependency of mechanical apertures to provide a better approximation to the observed hydraulic apertures.",

            "abstract": "Isotopic and elemental investigations of peridotite xenoliths can be used to model the timing and degree of melt extraction in the mantle. However, the primary melt depletion signature preserved in these xenoliths can be overprinted by subsequent metasomatism and melt-rock interactions, which tend to obscure the degree of original melt depletion either through the crystallisation of secondary phases or through the pervasive addition of lithophile element-rich basalt or its derivatives.\nAnhydrous spinel lherzolite xenoliths from the volcanic Maar de Borée in the French Massif Central have textures that vary from equigranular to protogranular. There is clear evidence of melt infiltration of up to several modal per cent in an anastomosing network of veins and stringers. Bulk-rock major elements and compatible trace element concentrations suggest that the Borée peridotites are genetically related by differing degrees of melt extraction, but the influence of melt infiltration, clearly visible at the thin section scale, and likely comprising several modal percent of the rock, makes this melt depletion difficult to quantify accurately. Some incompatible trace element concentrations in clinopyroxenes are consistent with melt depletion, while elevated (La/Yb)Nratios in others are clearly indicative of cryptic metasomatism and suggest yet another style of metasomatism. Furthermore, infiltrated melt along grain boundaries and in interstitial pockets disturbs the incompatible element mass balance, further obscuring the true nature of the prior melt depletion event(s).\nQuantitative lithophile element mass balance calculations will allow the effects of melt infiltration to be determined and stripped away from bulk-rock xenolith compositions, permitting a more realistic appraisal of the original melt depletion event.",

Here we present release 5 of the GOCE gravity field model by means of the Direct Approach (GOCE-DIR5), which was made with the GOCE data from the entire mission (Nov09 - Oct13) as well as with LAGEOS and GRACE data. Compared to release 4, GOCE data at the lower mission altitudes are included and the max d/o has been increased to 300.\nThe 3-axes GOCE gradiometer gave gravity gradients that are measured with a high accuracy only within its measurement bandwidth of ~ 0.005 to 0.1 Hz. Thus, the gradient observation equations must be filtered which was done by a band pass filter of 8-120 sec. The GOCE GPS-SST data are only used to geolocate the gradients. The low-to-medium degree spherical harmonic coefficients of the gravity field are determined using GRACE as well as LAGEOS data from GRGS Release 3. All data are combined at normal equation level and a regularized solution is obtained by Cholesky decomposition.\nThe GOCE-DIR5 data were used to make our latest combined model EIGEN-6C4. This is the 4th release of EIGEN-6C which was the very first combined gravity field model using GOCE data. EIGEN-6C4 is complete to d/o 2190 and was made from the GOCE-DIR5 data combined with DTU10 and EGM2008 surface gravity data. The combination of the different data types has been done on the basis of full normal equations up to d/o 370. In contrast to GOCE-DIR5 the satellite normal equation for EIGEN-6C4 contains 5 types of time variable parameters for each coefficient up to d/o 80. The coefficients beyond deg 370 were obtained from a block diagonal normal equation from the terrestrial data only.\nThe comparison of test results (orbit computation, GPS leveling, geostrophic current speeds based on SVP buoy velocity data) of GOCE-DIR5 and EIGEN-6C4 with previous gravity field models like EGM2008, EIGEN-6C3 and others demonstrates the gain in accuracy at high degrees, while their performance is identical to recent GRACE-only model for the low degrees. Compared to the earlier releases of EIGEN-6 this new release shows a general improvement. GOCE-DIR5 and EIGEN-6C4 are available at the ICGEM database at GFZ Potsdam: http://icgem.gfz-potsdam.de",

            "abstract": "Zircon, a widespread accessory mineral in rocks of felsic composition, is frequently used in various disciplines of geosciences as a petrogenetic, geochronologic and geothermometric tool. It can survive metamorphism and partial melting, and it is chemically and physically very resistant to erosion. As a consequence, zircon is very common in sedimentary rocks of terrigenous origin. Over the last decades, several studies have focused on detrital zircon grains to track the eroded source of sedimentary rocks. However, despite the fact that zircon chemistry allows its source rock to be dated and characterized in terms of crystallization temperature and composition, the detailed geodynamical context of the source rock is still very difficult to reconstruct.\nThe goal of this study is to infer the geodynamical crystallization environment of zircon from its geochemical signature. Differentiated igneous rocks from several geodynamic environments, including intraplate, active margin, ocean rift, and pre-, syn-, and post-collisional settings, were sampled, and zircon grains were separated, mounted in epoxy, and imaged by cathodoluminescence. The trace element signature of zircon was determined using (in-situ) laser ablation-high-resolution-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-HR-ICP-MS). Zircons non representative of original magmatic values (LaN(ormalised) > 1, PrN > 10 and SmN/LaN < 10) had been disregarded. Y and Yb seem to behave similarly if we compare zircons from all our samples. But preliminary observation of trace elements such as Nb, Ta, and Th plotted against rare earth elements allows us to characterise and discriminate several geodynamic environments. More particularly, Y/Th ratio and Eu anomaly seem to be significant to distinguish ocean rift and intraplate settings, thus confirming the geochemical control of the zircon crystallisation.",

            "abstract": "The Trans-European Suture Zone (TESZ), which extends from the North Sea to the Black Sea, marks a fundamental lithospheric boundary in Europe. It separates the East European Craton to the north-east, which has been stable for at least 1.45 Ga, from the younger lithosphere of Phanerozoic Europe to the south-west. In this study we use a large dataset of more than 40,000 teleseismic P- and S-receiver functions from almost 500 seismological stations to image crustal and lithospheric structure across central and eastern Europe between the Benelux and the Baltic countries. An important data source is the PASSEQ project, which deployed close to 200 temporary stations between Germany and Lithuania for two years with the aim to obtain detailed, 3D information on the upper mantle structure across the TESZ. Combining P and S observations, we find a stepwise transition in crustal thickness, spread over 200 km laterally, from on average of 30 km in Phanerozoic Europe to more than 45 km beneath the East European Craton. Individual Paleoproterozoic terranes in Lithuania can also be distinguished based on crustal thickness. Crustal layering is not resolved with the receiver functions, but a high Poisson's ratio of 0.27 is obtained for the craton, compared to 0.25 for Phanerozoic Europe, which is consistent with a thick mafic lower crust. Moho depth results show an excellent correlation with the interpretation of a seismic line in the area, lending confidence to the interpretation of deeper structures. The lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB), as mapped by S-receiver functions, is located at an average depth of 90 km beneath Phanerozoic Europe. Towards the east, the LAB is dipping to about 125 km depth beneath the Elbe Line. Below the craton, a mid-lithospheric discontinuity is found at about 80 km depth, whereas weak indications of the LAB are found at an average depth of 260 km.",

            "abstract": "Much catchment hydrology has been conducted in steep, perennial stream watersheds with shallow soil. In contrast, we investigated an ephemeral stream watershed with deep, highly weathered soils, gentle relief, and the dynamic hydro-climatology of the Piedmont region of the United States. We seek to gain new understanding about increasingly recognized challenges in the hydrological sciences, including influences of shallow and deep flowpath connectivity and the role of ephemeral streams in hydrologically connecting distal portions of landscapes. We investigated how overland, shallow soil, and deep subsurface flow across landscape positions and antecedent conditions manifest in observed baseflow and stormflow generation and the dynamics of dissolved organic carbon, electrical conductivity, and a suite of cations and anions. Extensive channel expansion and contraction coupled with spatially and temporally variable shallow and deep groundwater flowpaths led to both clockwise and counter-clockwise hysteresis in the relationship between runoff and solute concentrations as a function of antecedent moisture conditions. This suggests that vertical and horizontal hillslope connectivity to the aquatic system is variable across seasons and storms and influences biogeochemical expression at the watershed scale. Our research in Duke Forest, North Carolina has begun to elucidate the interrelationships between the space-time dynamics of runoff generation processes and observed biogeochemical behavior in this deeply weathered, low relief landscape, to provide new insight into processes widely active but less easily identified and quantified elsewhere.",

            "abstract": "The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a primary source of interannual natural variability in the Earth’s climate system. Here, we address whether the overall character of ENSO is likely to evolve differently over time under a regime of solar geoengineering than it would under unimpeded global warming. Analysis of output from the GeoMIP G1 (instantaneous quadrupling of carbon dioxide with a concurrent fully offsetting solar constant reduction) and G4 (continuous 5 Tg SO2 per year stratospheric injections for 50 years coupled with RCP4.5) experiments reveals no clear signal that ENSO amplitude, frequency, spectrum, or seasonality will be different under the respective climate regimes. Solar heating is an important control of Western Pacific sea surface temperatures. In the eastern Pacific, horizontal advection of water makes a large contribution to the surface mixed layer heating budget. Application of very strong negative radiative forcing would generate an initial La Niña response due to this dynamical delay in the eastern Pacific. However, we find that the initial negative forcing applied in G1 or G4 is not strong enough to detect this fast response. The same dynamical delay implies a slow El Niño-like response after 10-20 years. This response is also undetectable in G1 and G4. While state of the art global climate models have demonstrated the ability to produce plausible ENSO cycles, analysis of process-based variables, which quantify the physical mechanisms underlying ENSO, reveals that different models generate similar ENSO variability results for different physical reasons. If the physical processes underlying ENSO become more well-resolved in models, subsequent studies should be performed to take another look at the ENSO response to geoengineering.",

            "abstract": "Deglacial variations in upper ocean stratification in high latitudes are generally thought to have played a key role in changing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Deglacial destratification especially in the Southern Ocean may have provided a pathway for CO2 exchange between the deep ocean and the atmosphere, thereby increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations e.g. during Heinrich Stadial 1, as recorded in ice cores. During the past decade the subarctic Pacific received increased paleoceanographic attention with the aim to examine its potential for influencing the past nutrient cycle and oceanic release of CO2 via deep/intermediate-water formation, upwelling as well as associated changes in biogenic productivity. Today, the subarctic Pacific is considered a weak sink for CO2, despite incomplete nutrient utilization in surface waters. Accordingly, changes in subarctic Pacific upper ocean stratification and/or biological nutrient utilization and export production have the potential to effectively influence the oceanic-atmospheric gas exchange.\nHere, we present diatom oxygen and silicon isotope records from the North-East Pacific (Core SO202-27-6, Alaskan Gyre) and the North-West Pacific (Core MD01-2416, Western Subarctic Gyre), to investigate the development of surface water hydrography and silicic acid utilization in the open subarctic Pacific over the last glacial-interglacial transition. Diatom isotope records are interpreted in combination with new records e.g. on subsurface water development, export production, sea surface temperature (alkenone-based) and sea ice. The obtained results enable a fresh perspective on the relationship between subarctic Pacific and North Atlantic climate development and provide new information on the role of the subarctic Pacific during the last deglacial atmospheric CO2 development.",

            "abstract": "Partial carbonation of the uppermost oceanic lithosphere represents a significant natural reservoir for long term carbon storage. About 25% of the oceanic basement formed at slow spreading ridges is made of tectonically exhumed and variably serpentinized abyssal peridotites in which carbonates veins have been documented. Previous studies indicate formation of these veins at temperatures between ~180°C and <10°C, at the seafloor or in shallow levels of the exhumation faults, and from fluids ranging from pure seawater to seawater-hydrothermal fluids mixtures. In this presentation we show that partial carbonation of serpentinites dredged at and near the easternmost Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) similarly occurred in two settings: dolomite formed at temperatures ~50°C presumably in shallow fluid-rich domains of the exhumation fault(s), while aragonite formed at yet lower temperatures within a few meters of the seafloor. We also present a detailed petrographic study of carbonation textures showing that while carbonate veining is prevalent in the seafloor-type carbonation, it is superseeded by serpentine dissolution and replacement in our samples of the fault zone-type carbonation. In these samples, dolomite preferably replaces the matrix of a tectonic breccia, that comprises angular clasts of serpentinite. TEM observations and diffraction patterns identify this matrix as microcrystalline to amorphous serpentine and document the contacts between this material and the dolomite. A comparison with textures reported for carbonated serpentine breccia from the Alps, and the Galicia margin suggests that prior tectonic brecciation enhances the potential for pervasive carbonation of serpentinites in the oceanic lithosphere at both mid-ocean ridges and the ocean-continent transition of divergent continental margins.",

In recent years, regional haze with PM2.5 levels exceeding ten folds of WHO’s air quality guideline has become the largest air quality concern in China. To better protect the health of millions of people, the key question is whether we understand the formation mechanism of high PM2.5 episodes well enough to guide the formation of effective control strategies. Here we present a modeling analysis in conjunction of observational constraints to estimate the contribution of emissions, meteorology, and secondary chemical formation to changes in PM2.5 levels over China. Certain meteorological conditions are found particularly conducive to trigger fast increases of secondary PM under current emissions mixtures in China. While the nested-grid GEOS-Chem model reproduces the distribution of PM2.5 and simulates up to ~400 μg/m3 of daily maximum PM2.5, it fails to capture the large sulfate enhancement during haze. We propose heterogeneous oxidation of SO2 on deliquesced aerosols as an additional source of sulfate under high relative humidity conditions. Parameterizing this process in the model improves the simulated spatial distribution and results in significant increases of sulfate enhancement ratio and sulfate fraction in PM2.5 during haze episodes. Implications of our modeling analysis for PM2.5 pollution control policies will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "In geophysics, models are a fundamental key for understanding and predicting. To bring these models closer to reality, insufficiently known model parameters are optimized using measurement data. Usually, these models are computationally very expensive. For this reason, sophisticated parallel algorithms need to be used for their evaluation and optimization.\nThe measurements required for the optimization of the model parameters are often time-consuming or costly. For this reason, it is desirable that the information content of the obtained measurement results is maximal.\nSeveral conditions under which measurements are carried out are controllable. These conditions are also known as experimental design. This can be, e.g., the point in time, the location or the method of the measurements. These experimental designs can be optimized so that the information content is maximized. Thus, the number of measurements necessary for a certain accuracy of the model parameters and accordingly of the model itself can be significantly reduced.\nWe optimized the parameters of a global model for phosphate and dissolved organic phosphorus in the ocean using over four million measurement data. The uncertainty in the optimal model parameters and the model itself resulting from uncertainties in the measurements was estimated. Furthermore, experimental designs for additional measurements, consisting of the time and location of the measurements and the tracer to be measured, were optimized. We would like to present the obtained results together with the applied techniques for parameter estimation, uncertainty estimation and optimization of experimental designs.",

            "abstract": "Over the last two decades, InSAR has become a proven method for quantifying surface deformation resulting from magma movements. Historically, data availability was rather limited, which combined with long processing times meant that results often were not available until weeks to months after the event. The successful launch of the Sentinel-1a and ALOS-2 satellites will increase the over the last years already much improved availability of SAR images over volcanically active areas. This higher data volume potentially allows us to monitor volcanoes in near-realtime, but only if we can reduce the long processing time of current time series techniques. Here we present results from a rapid algorithm, developed and tested as part of the FUTUREVOLC project in Iceland, able to automatically produce high signal-to-noise results within hours.\nOur algorithm identifies for each pixel neighboring pixels that behave statistically similar through the time series, known as Statistically Homogeneous Pixels (SHP). We use these SHP to calculate the complex coherence of the pixel in question in every interferogram. This is different from other time series techniques, which typically select a single set of pixels in all interferograms. We work under the assumption that the SHP do not change rapidly over time, which allows us to estimate them on an a priori set of interferograms, and store them for later use on new acquisitions. This greatly reduces the processing time for new images.\nThe algorithm allows us to produce interferograms with respect to a new image within 10 minutes. Using 8 processor cores in parallel, we can then estimate the coherence for each pixel in the 15 closest pairs in approximately 45 minutes, assuming a 5000 by 5000 scene. Phase unwrapping and estimating the deformation since the last acquisition is achieved within a further 45 minutes. Our system will be integrated with existing near-realtime monitoring systems, like GNSS, already in place in Iceland. The integrated system will improve our ability to classify movements as resulting from magma movements or not, and allow models to better constrain depth and volume during ongoing events. Providing this kind of information in a timely manner to civil authorities, whom we are working with as part of FUTUREVOLC, is of great help in steering their response in times of crisis.",

            "abstract": "Active lava lakes provide a unique window into magmatic conduit processes. We investigated circulation patterns of 4 active lava lakes: Kilauea’s Halemaumau crater, Mount Erebus, Erta Ale and Nyiragongo, and in an artificial “lava lake” constructed at the Syracuse University Lava Lab. We employed visual and thermal video recordings collected at these volcanoes and use computer vision techniques to extract time-dependent, two-dimensional surface velocity maps. The large amount of data available from Halemaumau enabled us to identify several characteristic circulation patterns. One such pattern is a rapid acceleration followed by rapid deceleration, often to a level lower than the pre-acceleration level, and then a slow recovery. Another pattern is periodic asymmetric peaks of gradual acceleration and rapid deceleration, or vice versa, previously explained by gas pistoning. Using spectral analysis, we find that the dominant period of circulation cycles at approximately 30 minutes, 3 times longer than the dominant period identified previously for Mount Erebus. Measuring a complete surface velocity field allowed us to map and follow locations of divergence and convergence, therefore upwelling and downwelling, thus connecting the surface flow with that at depth. At Nyiragongo, the location of main upwelling shifts gradually, yet is usually at the interior of the lake, for Erebus it is usually along the perimeter yet often there is catastrophic downwelling at the interior; For Halemaumau upwelling/downwelling position is almost always on the perimeter. In addition to velocity fields, we developed an automated tool for counting crustal plates at the surface of the lava lakes, and found a correlation, and a lag time, between changes if circulation vigor and the average size of crustal plates. Circulation in the artificial basaltic lava “lake” was limited by its size and degree of foaming, yet we measured surface velocities and identify patterns. Maximum surface velocity showed symmetrical peaks of acceleration and deceleration. In summary, extended observations at lava lakes reveal patterns of circulations at different time scales, yielding insight into different processes controlling the exchange of gas and fluids between the magma chamber and conduit, and the surface and atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Structure I methane hydrate is the most common type found in nature. Structure I gas hydrate has two types of cages that gas molecules may be hosted. Because the larger cavities filled with ethane would be more stable than those filled by methane (Sloan and Koh, 2008), the larger cavities preferentially enclose ethane during the formation of gas hydrate, which results gas composition differentiation during gas hydrate formation.\nBased on the principle of gas composition differentiation, we establish a numerical model for the gas composition differentiation between methane and ethane during gas hydrate accumulation and applied the model to IODP site 1327. The simulation shows that the gas composition differentiation only occurs at the interval where gas hydrate presents. The lowest methane/ethane (C1/C2) point indicates the bottom of hydrate zone, and the composition differentiation produces the upward increase of C1/C2 within the gas hydrate zone. The C1/C2 reaches the largest value at the top occurrence of gas hydrate and keeps relative stable above the top occurrence of gas hydrate. The top and bottom occurrence of gas hydrate indicated by the inflection points of the C1/C2 profile are similar to those indicated by the negative anomalies of measured chloride concentrations (Riedel et al., 2006). By comparing with the measured C1/C2, the differentiation coefficient (kh=Xe,h/Xe,w, Xe,h is C1/C2 of the formed gas hydrate, Xe,w [mol/kg] is the concentration of ethane in water ) is calculated to 70 kg/mol. The top occurrence of gas hydrate indicated by the C1/C2 profile also confines the water flux to be 0.4kg/m2-year, similar to that confined by the chloride profile. To best fit the measured C1/C2 profile, the methane flux is calculated to 0.04mol/m2-year. Therefore, the C1/C2 profile could be used to obtain the gas hydrate accumulation information.\nAcknowledgments:This study was supported by Chinese National Science Foundation (grant 41303044, 91228206 )\n",

            "abstract": "Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is a basin scale, distributed hydrological model commonly used to predict the effect of management decisions on the hydrologic response of watersheds. Hydrologic response is decided by the various components of water balance. In the case of watersheds located in south India as well as in several other tropical countries around the world, paddy is one of the dominant crop controlling the hydrologic response of a watershed. Hence, the suitability of SWAT in replicating the hydrology of paddy fields needs to be verified. Rice paddy fields are subjected to flooding method of irrigation, while the irrigation subroutines in SWAT are developed to simulate crops grown under non flooding conditions. Moreover irrigation is represented well in field scale models, while it is poorly represented within watershed models like SWAT. Reliable simulation of flooding method of irrigation and hydrology of the fields will assist in effective water resources management of rice paddy fields which are one of the major consumers of surface and ground water resources. The current study attempts to modify the irrigation subroutine in SWAT so as to simulate flooded irrigation condition. A field water balance study was conducted on representative fields located within Gadana, a subbasin located in Tamil Nadu (southern part of India) and dominated by rice paddy based irrigation systems. The water balance of irrigated paddy fields simulated with SWAT was compared with the water balance derived by rice paddy based crop growth model named ORYZA. The variation in water levels along with the soil moisture variation predicted by SWAT was evaluated with respect to the estimates derived from ORYZA. The water levels were further validated with field based water balance measurements taken on a daily scale. It was observed that the modified irrigation subroutine was able to simulate irrigation of rice paddy within SWAT in a realistic way compared to the existing method.",

            "abstract": "We have examined a nonthermal emission of a preflare activity associated with M-class flare. This activity resulted in a filament eruption that was developed into a halo CME. It was observed by microwave from Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH) at 17 GHz and 34 GHz, Hard X-ray from Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) at 6-80 keV, and EUV from Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We found that a microwave nonthermal source appeared near a southern footpoint of the filament system during the preflare phase. Then it moved systematically away from there in the direction parallel to two-ribbons together with the rapid eruption of the filament system. It implies that the particle acceleration of the flare started near the southern footpoint of the filament system and, thus, it provided a decisive factor for the eruption of it. During the preflare phase, Hard X-ray source also appeared in the position close to microwave source and their source positions lined up depending on their energy-bands. Unfortunately, there is no RHESSI data during the main flare because it passed night-part of the earth. Here, we present the detail investigation of physical parameters and emission mechanism of the preflare nonthermal emission based on the imaging spectroscopy of microwave and Hard X-ray.",

            "abstract": "The Paleogene witnessed large-scale environmental changes, including the beginning of long-term Cenozoic cooling. The carbon isotope composition of foraminiferal calcite suggests a major reorganization of the carbon cycle over the Paleogene, with enhanced organic carbon burial in the Paleocene, and subsequent oxidation of this organic carbon or increased volcanism throughout the Eocene. The sulfur cycle is linked to the carbon cycle via the breakdown of organic carbon during bacterial sulfate reduction. Over geological time, carbon and sulfur isotopic shifts are often coupled due to enhanced pyrite burial being coupled to enhanced organic carbon burial, and enhanced pyrite weathering being coupled to enhanced organic carbon weathering. However, over the Paleogene, carbon and sulfur isotopes are fully decoupled, with the sulfur isotope record showing only one major shift in the early Eocene, after most of the carbon isotope variability is complete. One complication of interpreting the evolution of the sulfur cycle over the Cenozoic, is the fact that the mineral proxies used (typically barite) may not be temporally coincident with those used to reconstruct the carbon cycle (typically carbonate). Furthermore, these minerals are preserved in different locations, and therefore often must be extracted from different sediment cores in different ocean basins, leading to age-model uncertainty when the records are merged. To properly ascertain the phasing between early Cenozoic changes in the carbon cycle and the sulfur cycle, we would ideally measure all isotope records on the same mineral.\nA new sulfur isotope analytical technique [1] has been optimised for foraminiferal calcite as a proxy for seawater δ34SSO4. The δ34SSO4 in foraminiferal calcite can then be tied to records of carbon isotopes from stratigraphically identical samples, resolving previous age model uncertainties. We present coupled carbon and sulfur isotope records from the same core over the early-to-mid Eocene, to better resolve the relative timing of changes in the carbon and sulfur cycles. We use a numerical model to explore the environmental changes necessary for the observed evolution in both the carbon and sulfur cycles. [1] Paris et al, 2013 Chemical Geology, 345, 50-61",

The Wharton Basin is one of the most active intra-plate deformation zones, recently confirmed by the occurrence of the 2012 twin great intra-plate strike-slip earthquakes (Mw≥8.2) in the Wharton Basin. These earthquakes seem to have ruptured the whole lithosphere, but how this deformation is distributed at depth remains unknown. In this paper, we present a seismic reflection image from the Wharton Basin that shows faults down to 45 km depth, the deepest faults ever imaged in the oceanic setting. The amplitude of these reflections in the mantle first decreases linearly with depth down to 25 km and then remains constant down to 45 km. The number of faults imaged along the 233-km long profile show similar behavior. We also find that the number of earthquakes and the cumulative moment released as a function of depth show a similar pattern, suggesting that the lithospheric mantle deformation in this region can be divided into two layers: a highly fractured fluid-filled serpentinized upper layer and a pristine brittle lithospheric mantle where great earthquakes initiate and large stress drop occurs. Moreover, the upper serpentinized layer can transport a significant amount of water into the Wadati-Benioff zone, its base defining the lower boundary of the double Benioff zones, the dehydration boundary.",

            "abstract": "The age of the Matuyama-Brunhes geomagnetic polarity transition (MBT) is a key datum for the Pleistocene time scale. Modern estimates of this age vary over a range approaching the 21 ka period of an orbital precession cycle. Singer (2014) placed the transition at 776 ±2 ka, in agreement with the estimate of 773.1 ±0.8 ka of Channell et al. (2010) based on an orbitally-tuned marine ice volume age model for North Atlantic sediment cores. The 40Ar/39Ar data of Singer (2014) are from basaltic lavas with transitional paleomagnetic directions and/or anomalously low paleointensities, representing episodic sampling of the geomagnetic field with limited stratigraphic context.\nNew data from Sulmona paleolake in central Italy (Sagnotti et al., 2014) reveals directional and relative paleointensity records with unsurpassed stratigraphic resolution of the MBT. Here, biogenic carbonates contain numerous sanidine-bearing tuffs derived from nearby volcanoes of the alkalic Roman volcanic province. These tuffs, dated in the LSCE and BGC labs, punctuate the stratigraphic record of the MBT, documenting a smoothly varying sediment accumulation rate of 20-25 cm/ka during the interval between 720-810 ka. A minimum age of 781.3 ±2.3 ka (nominal calibrations of Nomade et al., 2005 and Steiger and Jäger, 1977) for the MBT is provided by a tuff 1 m above the MBT. Linear interpolation between bracketing tuffs yields an age of 786.1 ±1.5 ka for the MBT, and indicate a duration <100 years for the reversal. The Sulmona record thus clearly provides the best opportunity yet known to calibrate the age of the MBT.\nApplying any combination of reasonable modern choices of decay constants and standard calibrations to our data yields ages between 781 and 793 ka for the MBT, raising questions about the validity of the ice volume model of Channell et al. (2010) unless the transition was globally diachronous (Leonhardt and Fabian, 2007) over a time interval of several ka. Regardless of which calibrating parameters are used, our 40Ar/39Ar age for the MBT at Sulmona is 15 ±3 ka older than that of Singer (2014). These results underscore the need for high-precision dating applied to geomagnetic polarity transitions that are based on high-resolution magnetostratigraphy, in order to calibrate the GPTS and validate age models based on orbital tuning.",

            "abstract": "A primarily analysis of marine geophysical data acquired aboard the RRS James Cook in the framework of the project \"Characterization of seismic hazard and tsunami associated with cortical contact structure Rivera Jalisco Block Plate (TSUJAL)\" is presented. This survey was held in the region of Nayarit-Tres Marias Islands between February and March 2014. The examination of data recorded by 16 OBS 's, deployed along 4 wide angle seismic profiles is presented, using an airgun-array seismic source of 6800 c.i., which allows sampling the crustal structure to the Moho. The profiles are located along the margin off the Marias Islands: a profile of over 200 km NNW-SSE direction and parallel to the western flank of the Islas Marias Islands and three orthogonal thereto. These perpendicular sections sample the lithosphere from the north of Maria Madre Island with a profile of 100 km length, across Maria Magdalena and Mari Cleofas Islands, with a profile of 50 km long, till south of Maria Cleofas with a profile of 100 km long. Coincident multichannel seismic profiles with refraction ones are also surveyed, although shooting with a source of 3,540 c. i., and acquired with a digital \"streamer\" of 6.0 km long. Simultaneously, multibeam, parametric and potential field data were recorded during seismic acquisition\nA first analysis shows an anomalously thickened crust in the western flank of the Marias Islands, as indicated by relatively short pre-critical distances of 30-35 km. While the moderate dip of 7 ° of the subduction of the Pacific oceanic plate favors somehow this effect, the existence of a remnant crustal fragment is also likely.\nMoreover, the images provided by the parametric sounding show abundant mass wasting deposits suggesting of recent active tectonics, possibly generated by earthquakes with moderate magnitude as those reported in the Marias Islands. This set of geophysical data, not only provide valuable information for the seismogenic characterization and associated hazard with Rivera-Plate/Jalisco block, but it will also contribute to decipher the complex interplay between the accretion of the East Pacific Rise, the Magdalena Crest and the opening of the Gulf of California in the northeastern part of the diffuse Middle America Trench.",

            "abstract": "The Lake Geneva current field is controlled by a variable wind field and thermal stratification. Typical current patterns in the Grand Lac which is oriented roughly in the East-West direction were determined under real time wind conditions and thermal stratifications using the DELFT3D-FLOW hydrodynamic model. The model solves the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations, combined with a k-ε turbulence closure in σ (lakebed-following) coordinates. The model was forced by a space-time dependent wind stress and heat flux over a 2.2 km × 2.2 km horizontal grid (interpolated onto the model grid) provided by the Swiss Meteorological office (COSMO2, MeteoSwiss) in 2012. Modeling results revealed stronger circulation for the large scale gyres in the non-stratified season (winter), compared with the stratified season (summer). A clockwise circulation pattern in the western part and a counter-clockwise current pattern in the central part of the Grand Lac are identified under large scale north-easterly winds (Bise), which occur frequently. For large scale south-westerly winds (Vent), another frequent wind, a long-fetch (up to ~ 30 km) leads to a clockwise circulation pattern in the central part of the main basin while a counter-clockwise recirculating gyre is induced in the eastern part. Strong eastward currents are observed near the Grand Lac north-shore. The simulation results compared well with ADCP data and time series of temperature profiles from the middle of the Grand Lac.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake time series are widely used to characterize the main features of seismicity and to provide useful insights into the dynamics of the seismogenic system. Properties such as fractality/multifractality, intermittency and non-stationary clustering are common in earthquake time series, highlighting the complex nature of the earthquake generation process. Here we use statistical physics to study the temporal properties of the earthquake activity in one of the most seismically active areas in Europe, the Corinth rift (central Greece). The earthquake activity in the Corinth rift is typically characterized by fluctuating behavior, where periods of low to moderate activity are interspersed by sudden seismic bursts, which are related to frequent earthquake swarms and the occurrence of stronger events, followed by aftershock sequences. A multifractal analysis reveals the degree of heterogeneous clustering in the earthquake activity and correlations acting at all time-scales that suggest non-Poissonian behavior. These properties are also displayed in the probability density function of the scaled inter-event times (i.e. the time intervals between the successive earthquakes), where for various time periods and threshold magnitudes the distribution presents scaling and two power-law regions at both short and long time intervals. In addition, we use generalized statistical physics and a stochastic dynamical mechanism with memory effects to model this behavior. During stationary periods where the mean inter-event time does not fluctuate, the solution of this mechanism is the gamma distribution, while for non-stationary periods the solution is a q-generalized gamma distribution, which exhibits power-law asymptotic behavior. These properties seem to be fundamental in non-stationary earthquake time series such that they should be considered in probabilistic hazard assessments, especially in localized seismicity where highly nonrandom activity may be expected.",

            "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that between 2003 and 2009, 60 ± 6 Gt of ice was lost each year from the Canadian Arctic (Gardner et al., 2013), making the region the largest cryospheric contributor to global sea level rise outside of the great ice sheets. Glacier ice in the Queen Elizabeth Islands (QEI) currently covers more than 100,000 km2, representing 20% of Earth's ice-covered land area outside of Greenland and Antarctica. The vast majority of this ice is stored within six ice caps located on Ellesmere, Devon and Axel Heiberg islands. Recent satellite observations of the outlet glaciers draining these ice caps have revealed significant velocity variability on inter-annual and multi-year timescales (Van Wychen et al., 2014), though the drivers of these dynamics are not yet understood.\nHere we present results obtained in May 2014 during an airborne geophysical survey of the ice caps of Axel Heiberg, Ellesmere and Devon islands, including Agassiz Ice Cap (17,300 km2), Prince of Wales Icefield (19,300 km2) and Devon Ice Cap (14,000 km2). We used a Basler BT-67 aircraft equipped with a suite of geophysical instruments, including a phase-coherent VHF ice-penetrating radar, to measure ice thickness and investigate ice basal conditions along outlet glacier flow lines and in the interior of the ice caps. We reveal that the glaciers draining the ice caps of the QEI exhibit diverse characteristics over short spatial scales, and that fast-flowing tidewater glaciers are located adjacent to previously fast-flowing areas that have subsequently stagnated. Our results show that many ice cap outlet glaciers on Ellesmere and Devon islands are between 700 and 1000 m thick and flow through deep bedrock troughs whose beds lie below sea-level. Some of the outlet glaciers also have floating tongues of ice which extend into the adjacent fjord waters. We intend to use our results to characterize the substrate beneath the ice, and to reveal any variations in conditions at the ice-bed interface. Improved understanding of the processes controlling the flow of these outlet glaciers is required to improve projections of how ice in the QEI will respond to expected temperature increases, particularly in the context of amplified regional warming due to rapidly-declining Arctic sea ice cover.",

            "abstract": "One of the most fundamental insights for understanding how landscapes evolve is based on determining whether topography was modified by glaciers or rivers. Alpine landscapes featuring horns, knife-edged ridges, and U-shaped valleys are commonly associated with glacial sculpting, whereas fluvial erosion is known to produce V-shaped valleys via links between river incision and landsliding. Rivers, landslides, and glaciers are all capable of rapid erosion comparable to the highest rates of rock uplift, and there has been progress in modeling fluvial erosion and hillslope response, as well as understanding how landscapes react to the onset of glaciation. However, the timescale involved in the transition from a glacial to a fluvial landscape is poorly constrained and it is unclear how long glacial morphology can survive following deglaciation.\nWe tested whether the fluvial and hillslope erosional response to tectonic forcing controls the timescale over which glacial topography persists into interglacial periods. We used digital terrain data to quantify the degree of glacial imprint on topography by geomorphometric analysis of cross-sectional valley shape across a spatial gradient in rock uplift and erosion rates in the New Zealand Southern Alps. Our results show that tectonic forcing is a first-order control on landscape evolution and on the persistence of glacial morphology. In Earth’s most rapidly uplifting mountain ranges the lifespan of glacial topography is on the order of one interglacial period, preventing the development of a cumulative glacial signal from the added erosional impact of subsequent glacial stages. Thus we suggest that the present-day physiographic signature of glaciated landscapes is best expressed in, and limited by the extent of low uplift terrain. In addition, emphasizing that the presence of glacially preconditioned topography greatly influences glacial extent and erosion, our results imply that tectonic forcing governs the impact of climate depressions on active orogens beyond controlling their mere vertical extent.",

This is due to direct radiative effects from cirrus clouds, their impact on local water vapour abundances in the UTLS region and due to chemical processes on the surface of ice crystals. We investigate the variability of tropical cirrus cloud coverage over a period of 10 years (2004–2014) and its correlation with the Southern Oscillation Index. We use a global 3D offline chemistry transport model (SLIMCAT-Cirrus), with a parameterization of cirrus clouds formed by homogeneous nucleation. We compare the model's ability to reproduce the inter-annual variability in tropical cirrus extent with remote sensing data from satellites as well as with in-situ observations from the NASA Global Hawk in the Pacific region as part of the ATTREX campaign. Impacts from cirrus on the vertical transport from the troposphere to the stratosphere in the tropics and its inter-annual variability can be diagnosed from the model results.",

            "abstract": "In turbulence the structure function is by far the most widely used tool for the empirical analysis of the velocity field. This is due mainly to the work of Kolmogorov (1941) who hypothesised a homogeneous flux of energy and derived the famous 2/3 power law for the second-order structure function; — which corresponds to a 5/3 law for the energy spectrum (Obukhov, 1942).\nIn 1962 Kolmogorov refined his hypothesis to take into account the intermittency of the flux, with the consequence that the exponent ξ(q) of the structure function is not longer proportional to its statistical order q.\nIn this communication, we first show that the refined hypothesis can lead to different models that can have opposite intermittency corrections. Secondly, we demonstrate that the inverse problem, i.e., starting from a given expression of ξ(q) to recover the involved flux leads to an interesting problem of equifinality for the definition of this flux. This is done in particular in the framework of the Fractionally Integrated Flux model that gives a precise meaning to the refined hypothesis. The theoretical and practical consequences are illustrated with the help data analysis and simulations of turbulence in wind farms and urban lakes.",

The high microbial diversity of microbial mats makes studies of microbial ecology notably difficult. To address this challenge, we have been using a combination of metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, iTags and culture-based simplified microbial mats to study biogeochemical cycling (H2 production, N2 fixation, and fermentation) in microbial mats collected from Elkhorn Slough, Monterey Bay, California. Metatranscriptomes of microbial mats incubated over a diel cycle have revealed that a number of gene systems activate only during the day in Cyanobacteria, while the remaining appear to be constitutive. The dominant cyanobacterium in the mat (Microcoleus chthonoplastes) expresses several pathways for nitrogen scavenging undocumented in cultured strains, as well as the expression of two starch storage and utilization cycles. Community composition shifts in response to long term manipulations of mats were assessed using iTags. Changes in community diversity were observed as hydrogen fluxes increased in response to a lowering of sulfate concentrations. To produce simplified microbial mats, we have isolated members of 13 of the 15 top taxa from our iTag libraries into culture. Simplified microbial mats and simple co-cultures and consortia constructed from these isolates reproduce many of the natural patterns of biogeochemical cycling in the parent natural microbial mats, but against a background of far lower overall diversity, simplifying studies of changes in gene expression (over the short term), interactions between community members, and community composition changes (over the longer term), in response to environmental forcing.",

Understanding how rapid rises in water levels change flow structures and channel boundary roughness is key to understanding the relative significance of large events in terms of driving local and system wide geomorphic change. However, capturing the fluvial process dynamics in operation during such events is technically and logistically difficult, especially in the world’s largest rivers.\nDuring September 2013, on the peak of the monsoon, a series of tropical cyclones induced a large flood event within the Mekong basin. At the peak of the flood wave, discharge measured ~60000 m3/s; the 11th largest flood on record. Pre and post event high resolution topographic surveys of parts of the bed and bank were captured using a combination of contiguous multibeam echo sounding (MBES) and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) during the event. Simultaneously detailed measurements of cross sectional and near bank flow structure were acquired using an acoustic Doppler current profiler (aDcp). Together, these unique datasets can be used to characterise and assess the geomorphic impact of a cyclone induced extreme flood event on the Mekong. We show how flow structures in the near bank region evolve with stage during the extreme event and how the associated geomorphic response is modulated by the distinctive process dynamics of a mega-river.",

            "abstract": "The mechanism for sodium nightglow was proposed by Chapman in 1939, in which the emitting sodium atoms in the Na(2P) state were produced by the reaction of NaO and O in the mesopause region. Laboratory experiments in the early 1990s have shown that the NaO produced by the reaction Na + O3 are in the low-lying NaO(A2S+) excited electronic state, rather than the NaO(X2P) ground state, suggesting that the intensity ratio RD between the D2 line and the D1 line should be 2.0, in accord with their statistical spin-orbit weights. However, observed high resolution airglow spectra during the past decade clearly showed, surprisingly, that RD is quite variable. This led Slanger et al. (2005) to propose a modified Champman model, based on the fact that the ground state, NaO(X2P), resulting from quenching of NaO(A2S+) by atmospheric O2, provides a competitive pathway for the production of Na(2P). The paper also published a laboratory measured relationship between RD and [O]/[O2].\nHarrell et al. (2010) then noted that the Na(2P) atoms produced from NaO(A2S+) and NaO(X2P) will have different kinetic energies and hence emission linewidths, so that the D line ratio arising from each state, RA and RX respectively, should be separately measurable. They developed a Faraday-filter-based sodium spectrometer which in addition to RD measures RA and RX: values of RA = 2.22 ± 0.72 and RX = 1.44 ± 0.48 were reported from 5 nights of data. They also showed that the ratio R2 (the ratio of the D2 emission intensity from NaO(A2S+) to that from NaO(X2P)), and similarly R1 for the D1 emission ratio, are directly proportional to [O]/[O2]. Plane et al. (2012) then showed by considering correlation of the electronic potential energy surfaces connecting the reactants NaO(A2S+)+O and NaO(X2P) +O with the products Na+O2 through the NaO2 intermediate that the theoretical values of RA and RX should be 2.0 and 1.5, respectively, in good agreement with the observations. In this paper, we will provide a connected overview of these recent theoretical and experimental advances, and discuss a modification of the Faraday-filter-based sodium spectrometer that will increase the nightglow signal by two orders of magnitude, thus opening the possibility of a direct validation of the current theoretical model and an accurate, real-time method for measuring atmospheric [O]/[O2].",

            "abstract": "The expanding volume of deep-water multibeam echosounder data provides emerging opportunities for the improved characterization of the abyssal seafloor. Nearly 500 cruises criss-cross the oceans with modern wide-swath multibeam systems, and these cruise tracks have imaged a variety of morphologic, tectonic and magmatic environments. The qualitative analysis of the seafloor backscatter data strongly suggests a local and regional variability that correlates with sediment thickness, sediment type and/or depositional environment. We present our initial attempts to develop a method that quantifies this observed seafloor backscatter variability and to explore the causes and potential implications of this variability. Our approach is rooted in the Angular Range Analysis methodology, which utilizes changes in backscatter amplitude observed as a function of grazing angle, to characterize the seafloor. The primary difference in our approach is that we do not invert for geo-acoustical parameters, but rather explores empirical relationships between geological observations and stacked slope and y-intercept values. In addition, we also include the mean and the variance of detrended backscatter measurements. Our initial results indicate intriguing relationships between backscatter parameters and the CaCO3 content of surface sediments. Seafloor regions reported to have high manganese nodule concentrations also tend to have characteristic trends in backscatter parameters. We will present these regional correlations as well as some preliminary statistical analyses of the backscatter parameters and key environmental factors.",

            "abstract": "This study addresses risk evaluation for slope disasters based on watershed-wide estimations of soil moisture resulting from long-term hydrologic processes. Slope disasters have recently occurred throughout Japan due to heavy rainfall and rapid snowmelt. Climate change is expected to exacerbate such disasters in snowy regions, due to global warming. The quantitative evaluation of landslide risk such as that which has occurred at Nakayama Pass in Sapporo, Northern Japan, during the snowmelt season has remained an issue. A method for determining the soil moisture at potential slope disaster sites was proposed and applied to the Nakayama Pass disaster. The investigation site is on Route 230 connecting Sapporo, the capital of Hokkaido Prefecture, to Southern Hokkaido. This site is in the Hoheikyo Dam watershed and thus is influenced by its hydrologic characteristics. We propose a method to quantitatively estimate soil moisture, which is an important factor in slope disasters, by using the storage for each mesh as estimated in the distributed hydrologic model of the watershed. In this hydrologic model, snowmelt is estimated on the basis of the heat balance between the snowpack layer and the atmosphere. The storage in each 1-km by 1-km mesh is estimated as the water level of the tank model when rainfall and snowmelt are provided. Then, the total outflow from the watershed is estimated by synthesizing the outflow for each mesh using a channel routing method based on kinematic waves. The validity of the estimated storage is indirectly confirmed by the reproducibility of total outflow from the dam catchment that includes the disaster point. Storage amount at the disaster site was estimated by using the proposed method. It was found that the landslides of 2012 and 2000 occurred at the condition of maximum storage resulting from heavy rainfall, combined with snowmelt. Thus, this study suggested that the storage amount which consists of hydrologic cycle in a catchment area influences large-scale slope disasters such as landslides. It is believed that the risk of slope disasters resulting from high soil moisture content can be predicted by combining the distributed hydrologic model, which can consider rainfall as well as snowmelt, with appropriate weather information.",

Numerous impacts over ocean and land have also been identified. Here we use three versions of the Met Office Decadal Prediction System to provide a multimodel ensemble forecast of the SPG and related impacts. The recent cooling trend in the SPG is predicted to continue in the next 5 years due to a decrease in the SPG heat convergence related to a slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. We present evidence that the ensemble forecast is able to skilfully predict these quantities over recent decades. We also investigate the ability of the forecast to predict impacts on surface temperature, pressure, precipitation, and Atlantic tropical storms and compare the forecast to recent boreal summer climate.",

            "abstract": "Over the last ~6 years, remote time-lapse cameras have been deployed on Mt. Etna, Sicily, with a view to capturing the emplacement of a substantial lava flow field. Initial deployment of wildlife trail-style cameras in 2008 acquired data on lava channel processes during the 2008-9 eruption. In 2009, just in time to capture the dying phases of the eruption, an upgraded network of dSLRs was installed. The network has subsequently captured the steady growth of the New South East crater and the rapid emplacement of short-lived sheet flows that have accompanied the recent paroxysmal fire fountaining events. Most of the imagery has been acquired over distances of multiple kilometres, but the portability of the time-lapse setup has also allowed several opportunistic close range (hundreds of metres or less) deployments, to observe near-vent processes or effusion inside the Bocca Nuova crater.\nHere, we provide an overview of the equipment, and the approaches used to georeference the monoscopic time-lapse imagery through integrating with 3D data (e.g. existing DEMs, or data simultaneously collected by terrestrial laser scanner or photogrammetric techniques). The acquired observations of flow front emplacement, flow inflation, channel breaching and effusion rate variations that provide insight into the processes involved in long lived flow fields will be presented. Significant opportunities remain, for example, in the near real-time derivation of bulk rheological parameters, and integration with numerical flow models, and the challenges involved in using such imagery will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The interplay of processes within Earth’s radiation belts and the near-Earth plasma sheet play a major role in the energization, transport, and loss of energetic particles in the region. Both MHD and kinetic processes are found active even during geomagnetically quiet times in the flow-through region connecting the radiation belts and near-Earth plasma sheet. Many observations and modeling studies supported the importance of the interactions of waves and particles in vortices and reconnection regions. In particular, the lower-hybrid resonances, resonance branches between the ion and electron cyclotron frequencies in the plasma wave dispersion relations, could play an important role in converting flow energy in MHD scale to waves and heat ions and electrons in kinetic scale or vice versa. Recent observations from the Van Allen Probes and THEMIS spacecraft show enhancements of such wave activities occurred during the main phase of the geomagnetic storms when the relativistic electrons were going through the depletion and recovery cycles. The total wave powers in these events are comparable or even greater than those of whistler mode resonances along, indicating the physical processes at the lower-hybrid resonances are also important in energy conversion between waves and particles, particularly during the main phase of geomagnetic storms.\nWe use multi-point measurements from the Van Allen Probes and THEMIS spacecraft to study the kinetic processes of how the flow energy is converted to heat or cool ions and electrons in the region connecting the radiation belts and near-Earth plasma sheet. Using the in-situ plasma measurements as inputs, we will run the Waves in Homogeneous and Anisotropic Multi-component Plasmas (WHAMP) plasma wave dispersion solver to study the growth rates and instabilities of these waves near the lower hybrid resonances as well as the Alfvenic and whistler branches at lower and higher frequencies, respectively. We will present studies of two major geomagnetic storm events, including the well known, extensively studied November 14th, 2012, and another event with whistler solitary waves using measurements from the Van Allen Probes and THEMIS conjunctions and WHAMP analysis of the plasmas waves at the resonances.",

            "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of open-field artificial warming and precipitation manipulation on Pinus densiflora seedling growth. The temperature in warming plots have been set to be 3°C higher than control plots using infrared lamps since April, 2013. Precipitation manipulation consisted of precipitation decrease plots (-30%) with deployment of rain-capturing transparent panels, precipitation increase plots (+30%) with pump installation and drip-irrigation, and control plots. Two-year-old P. densiflora seedlings were planted in April, 2013. Seedling height and root collar diameter were measured in April and November, 2013 and April, 2014, and biomass were measured in April, 2013 and April, 2014. During the period of April to November, 2013, increments of seedling height and root collar diameter were not significantly different between control and warming plots. However, in April, 2014 seedling heights, new shoot lengths and weights were higher in warming plots than in control plots, with all precipitation manipulation treatments (p<0.05). Shoot to root ratio was lower in warming plots than in control plots with the precipitation decrease treatment (p<0.05). The seedling height growth observed in 2013 and 2014 might be explained by the previous year’s fixed growth of P. densiflora. Lower shoot to root ratio in warming plots with precipitation decrease treatment might be resulted from water stress. In previous studies about artificial warming and/or precipitation manipulation, the effects were increase, decrease or no difference in growth. As these results suggest, responses of growth are species-specific and/or are dependent on the stage of growth and the treatment types of climate change experiments. Therefore, to examine the effects of climate changes on plant growth, multi-factor and long-term studies on diverse species are needed.",

            "abstract": "Biomass burning (BB) smoke from deforestation and the burning of agricultural waste emit a complex cocktail of aerosol particles and gases. BB emissions show a regional hotspot over South America on the edges of Amazonia. These major perturbations and impacts on surface temperature, surface fluxes, chemistry, radiation, rainfall, may have significant consequent impacts on the Amazon rainforest, the largest and most productive carbon store on the planet. There is therefore potential for very significant interaction and interplay between aerosols, clouds, radiation and the biosphere in the region. Terrestrial carbon production (i.e. photosynthesis) is intimately tied to the supply of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR – i.e. wavelengths between 300-690 nm). PAR in sufficient intensity and duration is critical for plant growth. However, if a decrease in total radiation is accompanied by an increase in the component of diffuse radiation, plant productivity may increase due to higher light use efficiency per unit of PAR and less photosynthetic saturation. This effect, sometimes referred as diffuse light fertilization effect, could have increased the global land carbon sink by approximately one quarter during the global dimming period and is expected to be a least as important locally. By directly interacting with radiation, BB aerosols significantly reduce the total amount of PAR available to plant canopies. In addition, BB aerosols also play a centre role in cloud formation because they provide the necessary cloud condensation nuclei, hence indirectly altering the water cycle and the components and quantity of PAR. In this presentation, we use the recent observations from the South American Biomass Burning Analysis (SAMBBA) to explore the impact of radiation changes on the carbon cycle in the Amazon region caused by BB emissions. A parameterisation of the impact of diffuse and direct radiation upon photosynthesis rates and net primary productivity in the biosphere has been implemented within a fully coupled Earth System Model, namely the UK Met Office Hadley Centre HadGEM2-ES model. We present results from ten-year experiments (2000-2010) designed to investigate the sensitivity of the terrestrial biosphere to the burden and absorbing nature of Amazonian BB aerosols.",

            "abstract": "In 2008, a large area with several hundred methane plumes was discovered along the West Spitsbergen continental margin at water depths between 150 and 400 m (Westbrook et al. 2009, GRL 36, doi:10.1029/2009GL039191). Many of the observed plumes were located at the boundary of gas hydrate stability (~400 m water depth). It was speculated that the methane escape at this depth was correlated with gas hydrate destabilization caused by recent increases in water temperatures recorded in this region. In a later study, geochemical analyses of authigenic carbonates and modeling of heat flow data combined with seasonal changes in water temperature demonstrated that the methane seeps were active already prior to industrial warming but that the gas hydrate system nevertheless reacts very sensitive to even seasonal temperature changes (Berndt et al. 2014, Science 343: 284-287). Here, we report about a methane seep site at the gas hydrate stability boundary (394 m water depth) that features unusual geochemical profiles indicative for non-steady state conditions. Sediment was recovered with a gravity corer (core length 210 cm) and samples were analyzed to study porewater geochemistry, methane concentration, authigenic carbonates, and microbial activity. Porewater profiles revealed two zones of sulfate-methane transition at 50 and 200 cm sediment depth. The twin zones were confirmed by a double peaking in sulfide, total alkalinity, anaerobic oxidation of methane, and sulfate reduction. δ18O values sharply increased from around -2.8 ‰ between 0 and 126 cm to -1.2 ‰ below 126 cm sediment depth. While U/Th isotope measurements of authigenic seep carbonates that were collected from different depths of the core illustrated that methane seepage must be occurring at this site since at least 3000 years, the biogeochemical profiles suggest that methane flux must have been altered recently. By applying a multi-phase reaction-transport model using known initial parameters from the study site (e.g. water depth, temperature profile, salinity, and sediment surface concentrations of CH4, SO4, DIC, and POC) were able to show that the observed twin sulfate-methane transition zones are an ephemeral phenomenon occurring during increase of methane production in the sediment, which can be introduced by, e.g., gas hydrate dissociation.",

A Hamilton PRX-X100 anion exchange column with EDTA (pH of 4.7) and 3% methanol as mobile phase was used for species separation. The flow rate was set to 1.5 mL min-1 and a solvent gradient (linear ramp from 5 mM to 30 mM) was applied. The overall analysis time for all six desired species was 11 minutes. The detection limits for As(III), As(V), Sb(III), Sb(V), Se(VI) and Se(IV) were 0.02 μg L-1, 0.06 μg L-1, 0.2 μg L-1, 0.02 μg L-1, 0.2 μg L-1 and 0.4 μg L-1 respectively. The retention times for As(III), As(V), Sb(III), Sb(V), Se(IV) and Se(VI) were 1.70, 2.94, 7.14, 2.28, 3.38 and 9.36 min, respectively. Subsequently, the stability of inorganic As(III, V), Sb(III, V) and Se(IV, VI) species in different water samples (groundwater, lake water and river water) was studied over a time scale of 11 weeks. High concentrations of Fe (25.0 mg/L) and Mn (25.0 mg/L) were added to different matrices to simulate Fe and Mn rich environments. All samples were spiked with 5.0 μg/L As(III, V) and Sb(III, V) and 15.0 μg/L Se(IV, VI).. We investigated several strategies for species preservation, i.e., EDTA only, EDTA combined with acidification (HCl, HNO3, formic acid and acetic acid). The preserved samples were stored at 4 °C in the dark. For comparison, another subsample without any preservation was stored at room temperature in the presence of light. The results showed that a combination EDTA acidified to pH of 3 can be used to preserve all species for at least 11 weeks. While EDTA only (pH = 6) failed to preserve As and Sb species, although Se species were preserved.",

            "abstract": "Reanalyses on global to regional scales are widely used for validation of meteorological or hydrological models and for many climate applications. However, the evaluation of the reanalyses itself is still a crucial task. A major challenge is the lack of independent observations, since most of the available observational data is already included, e. g. by the data assimilation scheme. Here, we focus on the evaluation of dynamical reanalyses which are obtained by using numerical weather prediction models with a fixed data assimilation scheme.\nPrecipitation is generally not assimilated in dynamical reanalyses (except for e.g. latent heat nudging) and thereby provides valuable data for the evaluation of reanalysis. Since precipitation results from the complex dynamical and microphysical atmospheric processes, an accurate representation of precipitation is often used as an indicator for a good model performance. Here, we use independent observations of daily precipitation accumulations from European rain gauges (E-OBS) of the years 2008 and 2009 for the intercomparison of various regional reanalyses products for the European CORDEX domain (Hirlam reanalysis at 0.2°, Metoffice UM reanalysis at 0.11°, COSMO reanalysis at 0.055°). This allows for assessing the benefits of increased horizontal resolution compared to global reanalyses. Furthermore, the effect of latent heat nudging (assimilation of radar-derived rain rates) is investigated using an experimental setup of the COSMO reanalysis with 6km and 2km resolution for summer 2011.\nFurther, we present an observation independent evaluation based on kinetic energy spectra. Such spectra should follow a k-3 dependence of the wave number k for the larger scale, and a k-5/3 dependence on the mesoscale. We compare the spectra of the aforementioned regional reanalyses in order to investigate the general capability of the reanalyses to resolve events on the mesoscale (e.g. effective resolution).\nThe intercomparison and evaluation of regional reanalyses is carried out by the climate monitoring branch of the Hans-Ertel-Centre for Weather Research.",

However, the current understanding of the GSR subsidence affecting the hydrographic evolution of the Greenland Scotland Seaway and of the critical GSR depth providing effective water mass exchange between the oceans are largely based on conceptual models.\nHere, we emulate the GSR subsidence by means of a fully coupled ocean-atmosphere General Circulation Model (GCM) with integrated terrestrial vegetation dynamics (community of earth system models, COSMOS). The model setup comprise a global reconstruction of the mid-Miocene 20‒15 Myrs ago (continental geography, orography, bathymetry, ice-sheet geography and topography) and a change of CO2 levels in the atmosphere. Especially, we additionally integrated a high resolution bathymetric dataset for the area of interest (northern North Atlantic, GSR, Nordic Seas and the Eurasian Basin).\nIn different experiments we deepen GSR depth levels by increments of 100 m, ranging from a quasi-enclosed North Polar basin to an open gateway configuration. We identify thresholds in hydrographic communication across the seaway and discuss consequences in climate change and ocean characteristics.\nSecondly, we use the model setup close to the allocated depth threshold and test the models sensitivity by changes of greenhouse gas concentrations within the spectrum of CO2 reconstructions. We find that a shift in the modeled climate by CO2 changes directly impact the exchange of water masses across the GSR.\nBased on our model results, we provide a mechanism on the hydrographic opening of the NPS by controls of tectonic activity and CO2.",

The analysis is based on a combination of in situ SSS observations collected in the last three decades from voluntary observing ships, TAO/TRITON and PIRATA moorings, Argo floats and (few) CTD profiles. We show that the mean position of the Atlantic and Pacific low SSS waters is tightly related to the local minimum in Evaporation minus Precipitation (E-P) budget linked to the Inter Tropical Convergence Zones (ITCZ) and to salt transport by the eastward flowing North Equatorial Counter Current (NECC). We also show via EOF analyses that the meridional position of this SSS minimum varies both at seasonal time scale, with a northernmost position in boreal summer, and at interannual time scale in relation with ENSO and the Atlantic meridional mode, with however subtle differences in timing between the western, central and eastern basins. The role of the ITCZ-related E-P budget and NECC-related salt advection in these seasonal and interannual changes is examined. We further document the long-term meridional migration of these low SSS waters in the last three decades and discuss whether or not it is consistent with the expected global change effects.",

            "abstract": "Snowmelt is the primary water source for human needs and ecosystems services in much of the Western U.S. Regional warming is expected to hasten snow disappearance and reduce snowpacks. The soil water budget strongly mediates the effects of changing snowmelt patterns by storing water and altering is partitioning to evaporation, transpiration, and runoff. This study therefore asked the research question, “Under what conditions was soil water availability coupled to snowmelt magnitudes and timing across Western U.S. mountains?” We posed three potential hypotheses to explain decoupling between soil water availability and snowmelt: 1. Contributions from post-snowmelt rainfall, 2. Longer growing season length and/or greater water demand, and/or 3. Insufficient soil water storage. Using 259 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations, we showed that the timing of Peak Soil Moisture (PSM) was strongly explained by snow disappearance (Pearson r-value of 0.62). However, differences in the coupling of PSM with DSD were dependent on soil and bedrock type, with well-drained areas having earlier PSM relative to DSD. A second analysis focused on 48 SNOTEL and Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) stations in the Northwest and Intermountain Western U.S. where detailed soil hydraulic properties existed. We found the timing of snow disappearance was a strong influence (p<0.01) on the number of days per year that soil moisture was below wilting point at individual stations, whereas summer precipitation was a weaker predictor. We develop a framework to classify stations into three classes: 1. stations that were not subject to water stress from changing snowmelt patterns over the historical records, 2. stations subject to water stress during poor snowmelt years, and 3. stations that relied on rainfall to avoid water stress across historical records. Our combined results demonstrate that snow disappearance timing is a first-order control on soil water availability across many Western U.S. mountain ecosystems. However, soils properties could make areas more/less sensitive to changing snowpacks depending on seasonal precipitation patterns. This type of simple framework could be used to identify areas at risk of changing snowpacks and help constrain vegetation distributions as a consequence of climate change.",

            "abstract": "UAVs equipped with consumer cameras are increasingly being used to produce high resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) for a wide variety of geoscience applications. Image processing and DEM-generation is being facilitated by parallel increases in the use of software based on ‘structure from motion’ algorithms. However, recent work [1] has demonstrated that image networks from UAVs, for which camera pointing directions are generally near-parallel, are susceptible to producing systematic error in the resulting topographic surfaces (a vertical ‘doming’). This issue primarily reflects error in the camera lens distortion model, which is dominated by the radial K1 term. Common data processing scenarios, in which self-calibration is used to refine the camera model within the bundle adjustment, can inherently result in such systematic error via poor K1 estimates.\nIncorporating oblique imagery into such data sets can mitigate error by enabling more accurate calculation of camera parameters [1]. Here, using a combination of simulated image networks and real imagery collected from a fixed wing UAV, we explore the additional roles of external ground control and the precision of image measurements. We illustrate similarities and differences between a variety of structure from motion software, and underscore the importance of well distributed and suitably accurate control for projects where a demonstrated high accuracy is required.\n [1] James & Robson (2014) Earth Surf.

The goal of this study is to examine the fundamental processes involved in the physical and biogeochemical changes occurring in an ocean basin traversed by a zonally moving typhoon. The study employs an idealized typhoon wind field with varying intensities and translation speeds over a rectangular ocean basin. The model is based on the mpiPOM which is coupled to an NPZD biogeochemical model. The results show north-south asymmetric responses depending on the translation speeds of the typhoon, due to (1) the different intensities of inertial oscillation, (2) mixing caused by symmetric instability, and (3) re-stratification by mixed-layer baroclinic instability along the typhoon track.",

Since these scalar and vector measurements are both perfectly synchronous and spatially coherent, their comparison can be directly used to assess the ASM performances at instrument level with no need to correct for the various magnetic perturbations generated by the satellites. This presentation will detail the ASM vector calibration process, with an emphasis on its susceptibility to the ASM operational conditions (primarily the sensor temperature and attitude, but also sun exposition parameters). The evolution of the instrument’s performances during the first year of the Swarm mission will then be discussed, with a particular interest in the long term scalar residuals behaviour. These results will be analyzed to demonstrate both the noise performances of the ASM scalar and vector measurements and their excellent long term stability.",

During summer of 2011, we operated ten stations of wide band (band width 0.16 Hz – 2.5 MHz) electric field change meters covering an area of nearly 70x100km2 in and around Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida, USA. On 14 August 2011, we detected 245 positive polarity NBPs within 200 km of KSC. We identified characteristic variations of IBP wave forms in E-change data and categorized these into three main groups; Type A: clean NBPs (4.9%), Type B: NBPs with secondary peaks in the tail (27.5%), and Type C: NBPs with relatively fast rise time with a noisy fall/tail (14.3%). The majority (53.3%) of our NBPs could not be categorized into the above groups due to extra sub-pulses (noisiness) in the NBP waveforms. Therefore, we further categorize the remaining 53.3% NBPs into five other sub-groups according to where the extra noisiness occurred. Even though our waveform analysis does not suggest that these sub-groups are related to the main groups, power spectral density (PSD) curve analysis shows that each of these sub-groups has a similar PSD curve as one of the main groups. In this presentation, we will discuss these different types of NBPs and compare their physical properties including their altitudes (obtained by time of arrival method), isolation from other lightning activity, peak current estimations, RMS power radiation, and PSD curves.",

            "abstract": "Finding kinetic equilibria for tangential current layers is a key issue for the modeling of plasma phenomena such as magnetic reconnection, for which theoretical and numerical studies usually aim in starting from steady state current layers. The famous Harris equilibrium is known to be limited to symmetric layers surrounded by vacuum, with constant temperature, and constant ion and electron flow velocities, and with a current variation depending only on the density variation. It is clearly not suited for the modeling of ``magnetopause-like'' layers, which separate two plasmas of different densities and temperatures. In order to understand this kind of boundaries, Belmont et al (2012) presented a new asymmetric equilibrium which was validated in a hybrid simulation by Aunai et al (2013), and more recently in a fully kinetic simulation as well. For this equilibrium to be computed, the magnetic field had to stay coplanar inside the layer. We present here an important generalization, where the magnetic field rotates inside the layer (restricted to a 180° rotation hitherto). The tangential layers so obtained are thus closer to those encountered at the magnetopause. This will be necessary, in the future, for comparing directly the theoretical profiles with the experimental ones for the various physical parameters. As it was done previously, the equilibrium is tested with a hybrid simulation.",

Two of the satellite based rainfall algorithms are the Hydro-Estimator (HE) and the Self-Calibrating Multivariate Precipitation Retrieval (SCaMPR). However, unlike the HE algorithm the SCaMPR does not currently make any adjustments for the effects of complex topography on rainfall. This study investigates the potential for improving the SCaMPR algorithm by incorporating an orographic correction and humidity correction based calibration of the SCaMPR against rain gauge transects in northwestern Mexico to identify correctable biases related to elevation, slope, wind direction and humidity. Elevation-dependent bias structure of the SCaMPR algorithm suggest that the rainfall algorithm underestimates precipitation in case of upward atmospheric movements and overestimates rainfall in case of downward atmospheric movements along with mountainous terrain. A regionally dependent empirical elevation-based bias correction technique may help improve the quality of satellite-derived precipitation products. As well as orography, effect of atmospheric indices over precipitation estimates is analyzed. The findings suggest that continued improvement to the developed orographic correction scheme is warranted in order to advance quantitative precipitation estimation in complex terrain regions for use in weather forecasting and hydrologic  applications.",

            "abstract": "A two-dimensional model for solute migration, transformation, and sorption in a phreatic solution conduit penetrating a karst aquifer is presented in which the solute is anthropogenic to the natural system. Transformation of a reacting solute in a solution conduit has generally been accepted as likely occurring but actual physical measurements and mathematical analyses of the suspected process are lacking, primarily because of the logistics of sample collection and the complexities associated with solute transport through solution conduits. The model demonstrates how a reacting solute might be converted to a product solute some of which then diffuses to the solution conduit wall where it may become adsorbed. Model effects vary for laminar flow and turbulent flow in the axial direction. Laminar and turbulent diffusion in the radial direction also exhibits marked differences. In addition to single reaction zones simulations considered multiple adjacent and nonadjacent reaction zones, both with varying reaction rates. Reaction zones were found to enhance subsequent reactions due to some overlap resulting from the hydrodynamic dispersion caused by the axial flow. The simulations showed that varying the reaction rate coefficient strongly affects solute reactions, but that varying deposition coefficients had only minimal impacts. Application of the model to a tracer test that used the tracer dye, Rhodamine WT which readily converts to deaminoalkylated Rhodamine WT after release, illustrates how the model may be used to suggest a possible cause for less than 100% tracer mass recovery. In terms of pollutants in a karst aquifer the model suggests a possible explanation for pollutant transformation in a solution conduit.",

            "abstract": "In river systems, hydrodynamic forces are a major driver for geomorphic change, and a major influence on aquatic habitat. Representative modelling of channel hydraulics is therefore an invaluable tool in ecologically-led river restoration design, enabling a quantitative and objective assessment of complex processes that are essential to achieve biophysical objectives. Hydraulic modelling can form part of an iterative design process, utilised to indicate ‘design performance’ through a wide range of descriptors (e.g. physical heterogeneity, hydraulic micro-habitat) afforded by each stage of the design. However, it is important that the limitations of any computational fluid dynamic approach (e.g., 2D depth-averaged simulations) are well communicated to other specialists (e.g., geomorphologists, ecologists), managers, regulators and clients. One aspect of hydraulics where this is specifically important is in the use of vorticity and coherent vortex structures as indicators of habitat suitability and the probability of regions of scour or deposition. It has long been recognised that eddies structures provide important physical and ecological function in rivers but calculating vorticity changes using hydraulic models is relatively new in river hydraulics. The use of such calculations is growing in both academia and industry, especially as restoration approaches such as engineered log jams introduce significant vorticity into the flow. However, the introduction of vorticity needs to be modelled with very high resolutions near solid boundaries, and the convected vortex structures themselves are inherently three dimensional. Neither of these is routinely captured in river hydraulic models. Specifically, the interpretation of vorticity patterns or coherent vortex structures from 2D depth averaged river models must be treated with caution, or provided with further interpretation. We present work that demonstrates how coherent vortex structures and vorticity have been used to indicate the success of a number restoration designs in the UK, across a range of river environments and project objectives. We comment on how these 2D calculations must be further interpreted, based on a 3D understanding of the fluid mechanics, before conclusions and results can be presented.",

            "abstract": "The Earth's magnetospheric cusp provides direct access of energetic particles to the thermosphere. These particles produce ionization and kinetic (particle) heating of the atmosphere. The increased ionization coupled with enhanced electric fields in the cusp produces increased Joule heating and ion drag forcing. These energy inputs largely determine the neutral density structure in the cusp region. Measurements by the CHAMP satellite (460-390- km altitude) have shown a region of strong enhanced density attributed to the combination of cusp particle and Joule heating. The Streak mission (325-123 km), on the other hand, observed a relative depletion in density in the cusp.\nWhile particle precipitation in the cusp is comparatively well constrained, the characteristics of the steady and fluctuating components of the electric field in the cusp are poorly constrained. Also, the significance of harder particle precipitation in areas adjacent to the cusp in particular at lower altitudes has not been addressed as it relates to the cusp density anomaly. We address the response of the cusp region to a range electrodynamical forcing with our high resolution two-dimensional time-dependent nonhydrostatic nonlinear dynamical model. We take advantage of our model’s high resolution and focus on a more typical cusp width of 2 degrees in latitude. Earlier simulations have also shown a significant contribution from soft particle precipitation. We simulate the atmospheric response to a range of realizable magnitudes of the fluctuating and steady components of the electric field to examine the dependence of the magnitude of the cusp density anomaly on a large range of observed characteristics of the electrodynamical forcing and examine, in particular, the importance of particle heating relative to Joule heating. In addition we investigate the role of harder particle precipitation in areas adjacent to the cusp in determining the lower altitude cusp density and wind structure. We compare the model results to CHAMP and Streak observations and assess the distinctive features of the observations in terms of the various dependencies involved.\nAcknowledgements: This research was supported by The Aerospace Corporation’s Technical Investment program",

            "abstract": "Five years of oxygen isotope and hydrological survey reveal interannual variations in the inventory and distribution of river water over the Laptev Sea. Our results suggest that the Arctic Dipole Anomaly might connect the Laptev Sea river water inventory and the global Arctic freshwater inventory.\nIn 2007, 2009 and 2010 relatively low amount of river water (≤1500 km3) was found and was mostly located in the southeastern Laptev Sea. In 2008 and 2011, high amounts of river water (~1600 km3 and ~2000 km3) were found, especially in the central and northern part of the shelf, suggesting a northward export of this water. It has been suggested that atmospheric forcing mainly controls the Laptev Sea summer surface hydrography and for this period, the interannual variability or summer river water inventory is coherent with the summer Arctic Dipole index. This could suggest that the Arctic Dipole has been a dominant forcing controlling the distribution and the fate of river water discharged within the Laptev Sea over the 2007-2011 period, which is concurrent with the recently highlighted persistent shift in early summer Arctic atmospheric circulation (Overland et al., 2012, GRL 39, L19804). The variation in river water inventory over the Laptev Sea Shelf is also positively related with recent Arctic Basin and Beaufort Gyre freshwater inventory (with a 2-yrs lag), which suggest that the river water originating from the Laptev Sea have an impact on the global Arctic freshwater inventory.\nDuring the same period the brine inventory was also variable but was dissociated from the river water inventory variation suggesting that, during this period different forcing was influencing the brine inventory.",

            "abstract": "To understand earthquake interaction and forecast time-dependent seismic hazard, it is essential to evaluate which stress transfer, static or dynamic, plays a major role to trigger aftershocks and subsequent mainshocks. Felzer and Brodsky focused on small mainshocks (2≤M<3) and their aftershocks, and then argued that only dynamic stress change brings earthquake-to-earthquake triggering, whereas Richards-Dingers et al. (2010) claimed that those selected small mainshock-aftershock pairs were not earthquake-to-earthquake triggering but simultaneous occurrence of independent aftershocks following a larger earthquake or during a significant swarm sequence. We test those hypotheses using Taiwan's earthquake catalog by taking the advantage of lacking any larger event and the absence of significant seismic swarm typically seen with active volcano. Using Felzer and Brodsky’s method and their standard parameters, we only found 14 mainshock-aftershock pairs occurred within 20 km distance in Taiwan’s catalog from 1994 to 2010. Although Taiwan’s catalog has similar number of earthquakes as California’s, the number of pairs is about 10% of the California catalog. It may indicate the effect of no large earthquakes and no significant seismic swarm in the catalog. To fully understand the properties in the Taiwan’s catalog, we loosened the screening parameters to earn more pairs and then found a linear aftershock density with a power law decay of -1.12±0.38 that is very similar to the one in Felzer and Brodsky. However, none of those mainshock-aftershock pairs were associated with a M7 rupture event or M6 events. To find what mechanism controlled the aftershock density triggered by small mainshocks in Taiwan, we randomized earthquake magnitude and location. We then found that those density decay in a short time period is more like a randomized behavior than mainshock-aftershock triggering. Moreover, 5 out of 6 pairs were found in a swarm-like temporal seismicity rate increase. They locate mostly in high geothermal gradient areas, which are probably triggered by a small-scale aseismic process. Thus it rather supports the argument of Richards-Dingers et al. in which dynamic triggering by small mainshock is untenable.",

In particular, we use ground magnetometer data, made available by SuperMAG, to derive equivalent current maps, and analyze how these currents respond to 1) Substorm onsets, and 2) rapid changes in the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). We find that at substorm onset, determined from global auroral imaging, the average ionospheric current starts to increase almost immediately in the winter hemisphere, while a several minutes delay is observed in the summer hemisphere. In the winter hemisphere, the increase in current is on average larger than in the summer hemisphere during the substorm growth phase. During substorm recovery, the current decays more rapidly in the winter hemisphere, compared to the summer hemisphere. This is consistent with some earlier studies that show that the ionospheric convection changes more slowly when the ionospheric conductance is high.",

            "abstract": "The Messenger mission confirmed that Mercury's magnetic field is relatively weak and dominantly dipolar, but also showed the presence of a strong axial quadrupole term. This can be described equivalently by an offset of the dipole along the rotation axis. Furthermore, nonzonal field components could not be unambiguously identified. If Mercury's core contains more than a few percent of sulfur, crystallization may start at the core-mantle boundary rather than at the center. In the outer parts of the core iron snow would form, sink and remelt deeper down where it enriches the fluid in iron and drives compositional convection from above. The snow forming layer grows inward over time and a gradient in sulfur concentration develops which strongly stabilizes this layer against convective overturn. We study this scenario in MHD dynamo models. Aside from geodynamo-like dipolar solutions we find hemispherical dynamos. Here magnetic field is generated predominantly in either the the northern or the southern hemisphere. The axial dipole and axial quadrupole are of comparable strength at the upper boundary of the unstable dynamo region. Systematic studies show that the hemispherical solutions are favored by slow rotation and by a thick stable layer above the dynamo. A thick layer also axisymmetrizes and weakens the field at the boundary of the core. Mercury's observed dipole moment and the quadrupole-to-dipole ratio can approximately be matched by a hemispherical dynamo when the stable layer thickness exceeds half of the core radius.",

            "abstract": "It has been suggested that a greater amount of CO2 was stored in the deep sea during glacial periods via changes in biologic pump efficiency and increased uptake by a more alkaline ocean, characterized by carbonate ion concentrations higher than today. Reconstructing past ocean carbonate ion will enable better quantification of the relative roles of different CO2 storage mechanisms. Here, we present records of deep water carbonate chemistry since the Last Glacial Maximum derived from sediment cores located in New Zealand's Bay of Plenty. Today, Bay of Plenty mid- to deep waters consist of a relatively fresh Antarctic Intermediate Water overlying southern-sourced Circumpolar Deep Water, which in turn is underlain by CO2-enriched deep water, partially derived from the North Pacific. We reconstruct past changes in bottom water carbonate chemistry from the trace element and stable isotopic composition recorded in shells of the epibenthic foraminifer Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi. The boron to calcium ratio (B/Ca) in these shells indicates that during the last glacial maximum (LGM), deep water ΔCO32- was slightly less than the modern value of ~ 20 µmol/kg. When combined with shifts in carbon isotopes, these results imply changes in respired CO2 storage, with low-ΔCO32-, low-δ13C waters dominating during the LGM and higher-ΔCO32-, higher-δ13C waters prevailing in the Holocene. During the transition between LGM and Holocene, ΔCO32- shifts rapidly in the mid-depth record (~1,600 m), rising from ~5 µmol/kg at about 18 ka to a peak of 30 µmol/kg at 16 ka. To determine whether these sharp changes are due to vertical shifts in water mass boundaries or rapid changes in source water formation regions, shallower and deeper cores (~1,200 m and ~3,000 m) from the same region are also being evaluated.",

            "abstract": "In its final year in orbit, the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft is conducting a low-altitude campaign that features several periods during which the periapsis altitude will be as low as 15–25 km. During many of the low-altitude orbits, the spacecraft passes through Mercury’s northern magnetospheric cusp, which has been shown by MESSENGER observations at higher altitude (200–500 km) to be a key region of coupling among the solar wind, the exosphere, and the surface regolith. Plasma and magnetic field observations at low altitudes should add substantially to an understanding of processes observed to date in this important region: (1) Protons have been observed flowing into the cusp and forming a persistent loss cone. Documentation of similar characteristics close to the surface would greatly strengthen predictions that these ions are precipitating onto Mercury’s surface. (2) Upwelling low-energy (100–300 eV) Na+-group ions (mass per charge 21-30) within the cusp appear to be locally energized from surface-sputtered ions or photo-ionized exospheric neutrals. Observing the energies of these ions over a larger range of altitudes may allow the functional dependence to be determined, which would reveal further clues concerning their acceleration mechanism. (3) High-energy (>1 keV) Na+-group ions have been shown to be the dominant planetary ion in the cusp, exceeding at times the abundance of even solar wind alpha particles (He2+). In contrast to their low-energy counterparts, these ions appear to have been swept into the cusp from the dayside magnetosphere on newly reconnected field lines. The low-altitude extent of these observations, especially when compared with that of protons, can be used to evaluate this hypothesis and others concerning the entry of these high-energy ions into the cusp. (4) Short-duration, deep depressions in the magnetic field magnitude, called cusp filaments, have been commonly observed within the cusp and contain plasma of magnetosheath energies. Variations of these signatures at low altitudes will be a measure of the access of plasma through the cusp to the surface and its response to forcing by the solar wind.",

            "abstract": "Accurate and rapid estimation of permanent surface displacement is required immediately after a slip event for earthquake monitoring or tsunami early warning. It is difficult to achieve the necessary accuracy and precision at high- and low-frequencies using GNSS or seismometry alone. GNSS and seismic sensors can be integrated to overcome the limitations of each. Kalman filter algorithms with displacement and velocity states have been developed to combine GNSS and accelerometer observations to obtain the optimal displacement solutions. However, the sawtooth-like phenomena caused by the bias or tilting of the sensor decrease the accuracy of the displacement estimates. A three-dimensional Kalman filter algorithm with an additional baseline error state has been developed. An experiment with both a GNSS receiver and a strong motion seismometer mounted on a movable platform and subjected to known displacements was carried out. The results clearly show that the additional baseline error state enables the Kalman filter to estimate the instrument’s sensor bias and tilt effects and correct the state estimates in real time. Furthermore, the proposed Kalman filter algorithm has been validated with data sets from the 2010 Mw 7.2 El Mayor-Cucapah Earthquake. The results indicate that the additional baseline error state can not only eliminate the linear and quadratic drifts but also reduce the sawtooth-like effects from the displacement solutions. The conventional zero-mean baseline-corrected results cannot show the permanent displacements after an earthquake; the two-state Kalman filter can only provide stable and optimal solutions if the strong motion seismometer had not been moved or tilted by the earthquake. Yet the proposed Kalman filter can achieve the precise and accurate displacements by estimating and correcting for the baseline error at each epoch. The integration filters out noise-like distortions and thus improves the real-time detection and measurement capability. The system will return precise and accurate displacements at a high rate for real-time earthquake monitoring.",

            "abstract": "Recent detailed bedrock mapping in south-central Maine in the vicinity of the regionally extensive Norumbega fault system has revealed the presence of a previously unrecognized zone of overprinting ductile and brittle deformation herein referred to as the Ray Corner high strain zone. The nearly one km wide zone trends approximately 045o and can be mapped continuously for a distance of over 20 kms. Like nearly all previously mapped high strain zones of the Norumbega fault system, the Ray Corner high strain zone is contained within a single lithotectonic belt (Casco Bay Group) and thus while recording a polyphase history of high strain displacement at different structural levels, it does not represent a terrain boundary at the present erosional surface.\nThe Ray Corner high strain zone is characterized by an older (likely Devonian) pervasive steeply dipping mylonitic foliation. Lineations, where observable, are sub-horizontal and a variety of kinematic indicators indicate dextral shear. Quartz microstructures are consistent with grain boundary migration and sub-grain rotation recrystallization processes, whereas feldspars are fractured. EBSD analysis of recrystallized quartz ribbons reveal strong CPO patterns in c-axis pole figures (both Y maxima and bipolar maxima between Y and Z) that are consistent with prism <a> + romb <a> slip. These finding are consistent with mylonitic deformation occurring at temperatures in the 400-500oC range.\nSuperimposed on these earlier mylonitic fabrics in zones several 10s of meters across are a wide range of lower temperature brittle deformational features. These include spectacular pseudotachylyte fault and injection veins up to 3 cm thick, cataclastite breccia cored brittle faults up to 10 cm thick, and silicified fault breccia zones up to several meters across. While most of these brittle features cross-cut the earlier ductile fabrics, locally there is microstructural evidence of deformed pseudotachylyte layers within the mylonites suggesting a time of overlap between brittle and ductile deformational processes during the evolution of the Ray Corner high strain zone. Detailed studies of these relationships are in progress and should reveal information on what appears to be a polyphase history of displacement that occurred at different ambient conditions.  ",

            "abstract": "Passive mineral carbonation of chrysotile mining and milling waste was discovered at the Black Lake mine, southern Québec, 10 years ago. Indurated crusts were found at the surface and within waste piles where mineral and rock fragments are cemented by hydrated magnesium carbonates. A long-term research program has yielded significant insight into the process of CO2 capture from the atmosphere, and how it can be implemented during mining operations.\nLaboratory experiments show that the waste mineralogy is crucial, brucite being more reactive than serpentine. Partial water saturation, circa 40%, is also critical to dissolve magnesium from minerals, and transport aqueous CO2 to precipitation sites. Grain armoring by iron oxidation induced by dissolved oxygen prevents further reaction.\nTwo experimental cells constructed with milling waste and fitted with various monitoring probes (T, H2O content, leachate) and gas sampling ports, have been monitored for more than 3 years, along with environmental conditions. The interstitial gas in the cells remains depleted in CO2 indicating continuous capture of ambient atmospheric CO2 at rates faster than advection to reaction sites.\nThe energy released by the exothermic mineral carbonation reactions has been observed both in laboratory experiments (up to 4 °C) and in the field. Warm air, depleted to 10 ppmv CO2, vents at the surface of the waste piles, indicating reaction with atmospheric CO2 deep inside the piles. A thermal anomaly, detected by airborne infrared and coincident with a known venting area, was selected for locating a 100 m deep borehole fitted with sensor arrays to monitor active mineral carbonation within the pile. The borehole has intersected areas where mineral carbonation has indurated the milling waste. The borehole will be monitored for the next 3 years to better understand the mineral carbonation process, and its potential to yield recoverable geothermal energy in mining environments.",

The processes are the following: 1) unloading and loading of the lithosphere 2) isostatic disequilibrium, and 3) thermic anomaly.\nLoading and unloading corresponds to sedimentation/erosion and glacial cycles. They generate isostatic rebound inducing elastic upper crust flexural answer and changing stress and strain distribution at regional scale. The generated strain pattern is similar to gravitational collapse with normal faulting in mountain and reverse faulting in the foreland. We test several mountain mean elevations to further understand the mechanism, and then compare it to the data of 21 mountain ranges.\nThe disequilibrium between Moho and topography induces non-steady state strain and high slip rates difference for fault planes located in and out of the mountain range due to asymmetric, mainly vertical, displacements.\nA high temperature anomaly weakens the lithosphere and reduces fault slip rates due to a shallower elastic-viscous transition.\nWe also pay a specific attention to fault reactivation, for intra-mountain faults, and for far field inherited faults by quantifying and comparing slip rate on pre-defined fault planes in the model. Results show that these 3 processes can produce displacements on faults away from the mountain range area.\nFinally we discuss each mechanism influence and compare our results with region that are defined as “stable” with geodetic strain rates below the measurements uncertainties, but with moderate seismicity (M<=5).",

            "abstract": "The permanent cloud cover of Venus prohibits observation of the surface with traditional imaging techniques over most of the visible spectral range. Venus' CO2 atmosphere is transparent exclusively in small spectral windows near 1 µm. The Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) team on the European Space Agency Venus-Express mission have recently used these windows successfully to map the southern hemisphere from orbit. VIRTIS is showing variations in surface brightness, which can be interpreted as variations in surface emissivity. Deriving surface composition from these variations is a challenging task. Comparison with laboratory analogue spectra are complicated by the fact that Venus has an average surface temperature of 730K. Mineral crystal structures and their resultant spectral signatures are notably affected by temperature, therefore any interpretations based on room temperature laboratory spectra database can be misleading.\nIn order to support the interpretation of near-infrared data from Venus we have started an extensive measurement campaign at the Planetary Emissivity Laboratory (PEL, Institute of Planetary Research of the German Aerospace Center, Berlin). The PEL facility, which is unique in the world, allows emission measurements covering the 1 to 2 µm wavelength range at sample temperatures of up to 770K. Conciliating the expected emissivity variation between felsic and mafic minerals with Venera and VEGA geochemical data we have started with a set of five analog samples. This set includes basalt, gneiss, granodiorite, anorthosite and hematite, thus covering the range of mineralogies. Preliminary results show significant spectral contrast, thus allowing different samples to be distinguished with only 5 spectral points and validating the use of thermal emissivity for investigating composition.\nThis unique new dataset from PEL not only allows interpretation of the Venus Express VIRTIS data but also provide a baseline for considering new instrument designs for future Venus missions.",

            "abstract": "The Andes-Altiplano orogenic system, one of the most significant topographic feature on Earth, is the case example of subduction-type mountain belts. This latter conceptual model considers that the overall structure of the mountain belt forms antithetic to the subduction zone which marks the main plate interface, and as such poses several mechanical issues. Recent studies challenged this view, by proposing a model of the Andes involving an embryonic west-vergent intracontinental subduction, synthetic to the subduction zone and thus geometrically comparable to alpine-type collision belts. Here, we compare these two models of the Andes, by re-evaluating a cross-section of the range at the latitude of Santiago del Chile (33.5 °S). A particular structure, the east-vergent Aconcagua fold-and-thrust belt (AFTB), appears critical in discussing and discriminating between these two views. We revise the structural geometry of the AFTB based on satellite imagery, digital elevation models, existing geological maps and field observations. We propose a new 3D cartography and cross-section of the AFTB and conclude that the AFTB develops over a 2-3 km deep décollement, with a finite shortening of ~13 km. We integrate the AFTB to the well-documented fold and thrust belt forming the western flank of the belt and find that it is a relatively secondary feature of the Andes. From kinematic modelling using Move software (Midland Valley Ltd), we build a crustal-scale evolutionary model showing the progressive shortening of the Andean margin. We find that the AFTB can be modelled as a secondary east-verging structure, passively transported westward atop a basement ramp anticline forming the Frontal Cordillera. This evolutionary model is discussed and constrained in perspective of available thermochronology data. Our model therefore suggests that the Andes orogen can be mechanically modelled as an alpine-type collision belt, challenging our long-standing view of subduction-type mountain-belts.",

            "abstract": "According to Messages from the Bonn2011 Conference, involving local communities fully and effectively in the planning and implementation processes related to water, energy and food nexus for local ownership and commitment should be strongly needed. The participatory approaches such as deliberative polling, “joint fact-finding” and so on have been applied so far to resolve various environmental disputes, however the drivers and barriers in such processes have not been necessarily enough analyzed in a comprehensive manner, especially in Japan.\nOur research aims to explore solutions for conflicts in the context of water-energy-food nexus in local communities. To achieve it, we clarify drivers and barriers of each approaches applied so far in water, energy and food policy, focusing on how to deal with scientific facts.\nWe generate hypotheses primarily that multi-issue solutions through policy integration will be more effective for conflicts in the context of water-energy-food nexus than single issue solutions for each policy. One of the key factors to formulate effective solutions is to integrate “scientific fact (expert knowledge)” and “local knowledge”. Given this primary hypothesis, more specifically, we assume that it is effective for building consensus to provide opportunities to resolve the disagreement of “framing” that stakeholders can offer experts the points for providing scientific facts and that experts can get common understanding of scientific facts in the early stage of the process.\nTo verify the hypotheses, we develop a database of the cases which such participatory approaches have been applied so far to resolve various environmental disputes based on literature survey of journal articles and public documents of Japanese cases.\nAt present, our database is constructing. But it's estimated that conditions of framing and providing scientific information are important driving factors for problem solving and consensus building. And it's important to refine the driving factors, evaluating if components of database are enough to present each process or not.",

Such integrated data products and services can be used to study interdisciplinary issues by investigators representing various disciplines. In addition to the scientific benefits that can be attained by integrating remote sensing data with socioeconomic data, the integration of these data also present challenges that reflect the complex issues that arise when sharing and integrating different types of science data. When integrating one or more datasets that contain sensitive information, data producers need to be aware of the limitations that have been placed upon the data to protect private property, species or other inhabitants that reside on the property, or restricted information about a particular location. Similarly, confidentiality and privacy issues are a concern for data that have been collected about individual humans and families who have volunteered to serve as human research subjects or whose personal information may have been collected without their knowledge. In addition, intellectual property rights that are associated with a particular dataset may prevent integration with other data or pose constraints on the use of the resulting data products or services. These challenges will be described along with approaches that can be applied to address them when planning projects that involve the integration of remote sensing data with socioeconomic data.",

            "abstract": "Ocean infragravity (IG) waves are long surface gravity waves generated along shorelines by incident swell and wind-waves. They have been studied mostly in the context of nearshore morphodynamics and harbor agitation, where their heights often exceeds 10 cm in shallow water. In the open ocean, infragravity wave properties are only known from sparse bottom pressure records, with heights of the order of 1 cm. In spite of these small amplitudes, they can be of much importance for ice shelf break up and errors in measurements of sea level by future satellite altimeters. Here we show how a recently developed numerical model can be used to interpret bottom pressure records from stations scattered across ocean basins. We show that bottom pressure signals in the infragravity frequency band can be dominated by bursts of energy that travel across ocean basins from the west coasts, and last several days. Two particularly strong events recorded in 2008 are studied, one in the North Pacific and the other in the North Atlantic. It was shown that infragravity waves are able to travel long distances without significant dissipation, so that the energy recorded in depths beyond 3000 m in the western part of an ocean basin is often dominated by waves coming from the other side of the same ocean basin.\nThe figures below shows (a) the modelled instantaneous IG wave field on 06/01/2008 over the North-Atlantic Ocean with locations of pressure sensors used (red squares). (b) IG levels measured (black lines) and modelled values (red lines and circles) for the corresponding station. Pressure values were translated into surface elevation for the frequency range 0.005Hz to 0.012Hz",

            "abstract": "Multi-spacecraft observations of Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs) show that the SEPs can spread large distances across the mean Parker spiral field. The SEPs accelerated during a solar eruption can be observed 360° around the Sun, and the dependence of SEP peak intensity on heliographic longitude at 1 AU has been fitted with Gaussian profiles with σ=30-50° for several events (e.g., Dresing et al 2014; Richardson et al 2014). SEP anisotropy measurements suggest that interplanetary transport is an important factor to the SEP cross-field extent (Dresing et al 2014). However, the currently used diffusive Fokker Planck (FP) description of SEP transport, with realistic diffusion coefficients, has been found insufficient to explain the SEP event cross-field extents. Recently Laitinen et al (2013) emphasised the importance of particle propagation along meandering field lines, which cannot be described as diffusion. They showed that early in an event field line meandering dominates particle cross-field transport and produces events wider than the FP description. They also introduced a new FP model that incorporates both field line meandering and SEP cross-field diffusion using stochastic differential equations and a constant background magnetic field. In this work, we implement the new FP model into Parker field geometry, to study the evolution of an SEP event in the interplanetary space. We compare the new model to the traditional FP approach by using particle and field line diffusion coefficients that are calculated consistently for both models using an assumed radial and spectral description of the turbulence evolution. We find that while the traditional SEP propagation modelling gives typically longitudinal extent with σ=10-20°, the new model results in values σ=30-50°, which is consistent with SEP observations. We conclude that field line meandering must be taken into account when modelling SEP propagation in the interplanetary space.",

Positive NBPs are classified according to their location, found using a three-dimensional time-of-arrival method, within the thundercloud radar echo. Using NEXRAD radar data, the NBPs are classified as occurring (1) in the Updraft region, (2) Outside of the Updraft region, or (3) in the Anvil region. Total of 177 positive NBPs found on one storm day in several Florida storms were analyzed and categorized into the above groups. A large majority of the NBPs occurred in the Updraft region (over 80%), while about 15% occurred in Outside of the updraft region and only few percent occurred in the Anvil region. The NBPs were more common in or above high radar reflectivity regions ≥ 30 dBZ, yet many were associated with ≤ 30 dBZ and even ≤ 20 dBZ regions. There are also cases of re-occurrence of an NBP in close proximity (within 500 m in x and y position) to previous NBP locations: 38 of these re-occurrences were doublets, and there were seven triplets present. One case with four very close (within about 350 m horizontally and with only 23 - 494 s time separation) proximate occurrences can be seen in our data set. Recently Karunarathne et al. [2014] have identified three main types of NBPs according to their electromagnetic wave shapes as (a) clean bipolar, (b) those with secondary peaks and (c) those with faster rise time and longer duration. In this study, the presence of these wave shape types within the updraft, outside of the updraft and the anvil region are analyzed. The majority (over 50 %) of the NBPs in the updraft region comprised with type (b) NBPs. Outside of the updraft and the anvil contained majority of type (c) NBPs. Outside of the updraft, only a very few type (a) NBPs are found among this set of 177 examples.",

With time, growing interest in surface and groundwater interactions, local refinement with nested and unstructured grids, karst groundwater flow, solute transport, and saltwater intrusion, has led to the development of numerous MODFLOW versions. Although these MODFLOW versions are often based on the core version (presently MODFLOW-2005), there are often incompatibilities that restrict their use with one another. In many cases, development of these alternative versions has been challenging due to the underlying MODFLOW structure, which was designed for simulation with a single groundwater flow model using a rectilinear grid. A new object-oriented framework is being developed for MODFLOW to provide a platform for supporting multiple models and multiple types of models within the same simulation. In the new design, any number of numerical models can be tightly coupled at the matrix level by adding them to the same numerical solution, or they can be iteratively coupled until there is convergence between them. Transfer of information between models is isolated to exchange objects, which allow models to be developed and used independently. For existing MODFLOW users, this means that the program can function in the same way it always has for a single groundwater flow model. Within this new framework, a regional-scale groundwater model may be coupled with multiple local-scale groundwater models. Or, a surface water flow model can be coupled to multiple groundwater flow models. The framework naturally allows for the simulation of solute transport. Presently, unstructured control-volume finite-difference models have been implemented in the framework for three-dimensional groundwater flow and solute transport. The flexibility of this new framework is demonstrated through a collection of test problems involving multi-model flow, transport, and variable-density flow and transport.",

            "abstract": "Tsunamis caused by submarine mass failures constitute a widely recognized source of natural hazard. However, in the NE Atlantic the tsunami hazard posed by landslides remains poorly studied.\nIn this study, we attempt to contribute to a better understanding of the tsunami hazard of landslides origin. We investigate the tsunami hazard posed by deepwater submarine landslide failures in the Gorringe Bank (GB) area, NE Atlantic. This investigation requires detailed marine geological data and a robust numerical model to simulate both the mass failure flow and the subsequent tsunami.\nThe analysis of both swath-bathymetric data and the multichannel seismic profiles revealed evidences of the presence of at least three large deepwater mass failures in the GB area of possible tsunamigenic potential. It also allows defining the geomorphologic characteristics of the identified submarine landslides, which include the erosional area (dimensions, scarps) and the depositional area (sediments extent, volume). Some depositional volumes reach ~80km3.\nTo simulate the flow of the mudslide failure and the wave induced by the seafloor motion we employ a multi-layers viscous shallow-water (VSW) model. The lower layer represents the slide assumed to be a viscous-incompressible fluid, and characterized by sediments density, and kinematic viscosity. It is bounded by the upper layer consisting of seawater assumed to be inviscid and incompressible. We solve the VSW equations in a finite-difference scheme considering a “two-way” coupling approach.\nThe results are presented in terms of: i) evidences of submarine mass failures in the area of GB; ii) simulations of seafloor motion due to the occurrence slides failures; ii) simulations of tsunami generation induced by the submarine landslide flow; and iii) simulations of tsunami propagation and coastal impact. Results show that, using the VSW model, we are able to reliably reproduce the sediment deposit induced by slide failures. In some cases, the resulting initial tsunami wave reaches ~10m. We find that deepwater mudslides in the GB area have a significant potential of tsunami generation in the NE Atlantic region with a possible impact along the near-coasts.\nThis work is supported by the FCT project CONDRIBER, Ref.

            "abstract": "Shallow convection has been studied in the sea breeze frontal zone along the Arabian Red Sea coast. This convection is forced by thermal and dynamic instabilities and generally is capped below 500 hPa. The thermally induced sea breeze modifies the desert Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) and propagates inland as a density current. The leading edge of the denser marine air rapidly moves inland undercutting the hot and dry desert air mass. The warm air lifts up along the sea breeze front (SBF). Despite large moisture flux from the sea, the shallow convection in SBF does not cause precipitation on the most part of the Arabian coastal plane. The main focus of this research is to study the vertical structure and extent of convective activity in SBF and to differentiate flow regimes that lead to dry and wet convection. The Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) has been employed at a high spatial resolution of 500 m to investigate the thermodynamic structure of the atmospheric column along the SBF. We found that convection occurs during offshore and cross-shore mean wind conditions; precipitation in SBF frequently develops in the southern region of the Red Sea along the high terrain of Al-Sarawat Mountains range, while on most of the days convection is dry in the middle region and further north of the Red Sea. The coherent structures in the PBL, horizontal convective rolls (HCRs) and open convective cells (OCCs), play an important role shaping interaction of SBF with the desert boundary layer. The HCRs develop in the midmorning along the mean wind vector and interact with the SBF. Later in the afternoon HCRs evolve into OCCs. The convection is strongest, where the HCR and OCC updrafts overlap with SBF and is weakest in their downdraft regions.",

            "abstract": "Plasticity/Fracture and rock failure are essential ingredients in geodynamic models as terrestrial rocks do not possess an infinite yield strength. Numerous physical mechanisms have been proposed to limit the strength of rocks, including low temperature plasticity and brittle fracture. While ductile and creep behavior of rocks at depth is largely accepted, the constitutive relations associated with brittle failure, or shear localisation, are more controversial. Nevertheless, there are really only a few macroscopic constitutive laws for visco-plasticity that are regularly used in geodynamics models. Independent of derivation, all of these can be cast as simple effective viscosities which act as stress limiters with different choices for yield surfaces; the most common being a von Mises (constant yield stress) or Drucker-Prager (pressure dependent yield-stress) criterion. The choice of plasticity model, however, can have significant consequences for the degree of non-linearity in a problem and the choice and efficiency of non-linear solvers.\nHere we describe a series of simplified 2 and 3-D model problems to elucidate several issues associated with obtaining accurate description and solution of visco-plastic problems. We demonstrate that\n1) Picard/Successive substitution schemes for solution of the non-linear problems can often stall at large values of the non-linear residual, thus producing spurious solutions\n2) Combined Picard/Newton schemes can be effective for a range of plasticity models, however, they can produce serious convergence problems for strongly pressure dependent plasticity models such as Drucker-Prager.\n3) Nevertheless, full Drucker-Prager may not be the plasticity model of choice for strong materials as the dynamic pressures produced in these layers can develop pathological behavior with Drucker-Prager, leading to stress strengthening rather than stress weakening behavior.\n4) In general, for any incompressible Stoke's problem, it is highly advisable to look at the predicted dynamic pressure fields, particularly if they are being fed back into the rheology.\nGiven a range of well described model problems, we discuss broader issues of what, if any, are appropriate plasticity models and under what circumstances we can expect to obtain accurate solutions from such formulations.",

Users desire more data and, more importantly, more frequent data to better understand the trends and impacts of these extreme events. Additionally, the Sustainable Land Imaging (SLI) thrust faces the difficult task of providing continuity of measurements in a strict budget-constrained environment. To that end, the desire is to reduce the size, mass, and – most importantly – cost of future US land imaging capability, without impacting the continuity of the SLI data with past Landsat archives. During our exploration of possible alternatives for future Landsat missions, we re-opened the trade space to include scanned options. The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) has been delivered to NASA/NOAA for flight on GOES-R, and additional models are in fabrication for various customers. Adapting this in-production instrument to flight at low-Earth orbit is relatively straightforward, and leads to a simple, high-heritage (low-risk) concept for a full-spectrum Landsat instrument that would meet virtually all of the Landsat 8 ",

            "abstract": "A methodology for a complete description of the marine stratocumulus clouds geometrical and microphysical properties was developed and tested. These include, among others, coupling state and cloud geometrical depth. The methodology combines simultaneous observations from several A-TRAIN instruments (CALIPSO, CloudSat and MODIS) and re-analysis data.\nAnalysis of different types of Marine Stratocumulus (MSC) scenes revealed interesting features. While most of the MSC that we have analyzed existed within a coupled Marine Boundary Layer (MBL), those that existed in a de-coupled MBL, i.e., cloud layer that is de-coupled from the ocean surface, lacked the typical spatial cellular organization. It was found that the occurrence of rain within closed cells breaks and organizes them into open cells only when the clouds are coupled with the surface. Otherwise the closed cells remain as thin lightly precipitating stratiform clouds having low cloud water. The coupling state was also found to affect the ability of drizzle to break closed cells, so that closed cells in a de-coupled MBL tend to produce stronger drizzle before breaking up.\nWe hypothesize that rain driven downdrafts hit the surface and form gust fronts that trigger convective elements, which break the cloud deck, only when the clouds are coupled to the surface. Among the other problems that can be answered by using the presented methodology is disentangling the role of large scale meteorology and aerosols on the development of precipitation (i.e., cloud depth versus droplet concentrations as a limiting factor for drizzle initiation). Examples will be shown together with their physical interpretation.",

This raises the question of what is the typical and atypical composition in different regions of the magnetotail. Previous compositional studies have mostly focused on regions of the magnetosphere inside of 17 Rs (Young et al., 2005; Thomsen et al., 2010) and in this paper we present a survey of the bulk plasma composition using time-of-flight data from the CAPS/IMS instrument on Cassini.

We extract the simultaneously measured distributions of multi-ion species and examine the wave spectral properties developed under the realistic plasma conditions by carrying out hybrid simulations.

            "abstract": "Understanding the chemistry of free-radicals in the atmosphere is necessary to understand the lifetime of primary pollutants and production of secondary pollutants, such as ozone. In the urban environment, field observations of HONO have revealed elevated concentrations persisting throughout the day and subsequent modelling studies have identified HONO as the major OH precursor (e.g. Elshorbany et al. 2009). Attempts to reproduce the strong daytime HONO signature in models, however, have revealed that the currently known chemistry is unable to account for the levels observed.\nHere we present simultaneous measurements of OH, HO2, RO2 and HONO made during the Clean air for London project in the summer of 2012. HONO concentrations were observed to build up throughout the night, with concentrations exceeding 2ppbV on several nights. Daytime concentrations were lower, but ~ 300 pptv was observed to persist throughout the afternoon. Zero dimensional box modelling studies, constrained with the detailed MCM chemistry and to the measured HONO, suggest that HONO makes up ~85% of the primary OH budget and just over 50% of the total primary radical budget at noon. The model, however, greatly over-predicts the OH concentrations (and HO2 and RO2concentrations) observed.\nUnconstrained to HONO, the basic model is unable to reproduce the measured HONO concentrations. A source of HONO from the reaction of NO2 with HO2.H2O, as postulated by Li et al. (2014), can enhance HONO concentrations considerably and also reduces the discrepancy between modelled and measured radicals by reducing the fraction of HONO acting as a net radical source. The model still underestimates the observed HONO by ~ 80% at noon, suggesting that this portion of HONO should still be considered as a primary radical source.\nThe net in-situ ozone production estimated from the measured peroxy radical concentrations and their reaction with NO is sufficient to account for the daily increases in ozone that were observed. Enhancements in radical concentrations on warm, sunny days, driven by two-fold enhancements in production from HONO and other photolytic sources, have been found to elevate ozone levels beyond the EU air quality recommendations.\nElshorbany et al.

Various rivers i.e. Chitral, Swat, Kabul, Hunza, Gilgit, Astore, Shigar, Shyok & tributaries contribute water to main Indus River. The elevation of UIB ranges from 254 m to 8570 m a.m.s.l. Changes in climate and related hydrological impacts vary in space and time as affected by local climatic and topographic settings. So, the objective of this study was to assess the climate change and related hydrological impacts resulting from altitudinal variability. Trend analyses were performed by applying Mann-Kendall and Sen’s method was applied to estimate slope time series that indicates changes in river flows. The results of this study indicate that maximum temperature in annual, winter, spring and autumn seasons has increased with increased in altitude while annual, winter and autumn minimum temperature has decreased with increased in altitude for the period (1961-2011). Moreover, annual, winter, summer and autumn precipitation has been decreased. The impact of altitudinal variability under changing climate yields that annual and seasonal streamflows in River Indus (at Kharmong, Alam Br. and Khairabad), Sawat (at Kalam) and Kabul (at Nowshera) have decreased whereas in River Shoyk (9%), Shigar (7%) and Indus at Kachura (5%) have been increased. However, annual runoff in Gilgit (1%) and Hunza River (18%) has increased by increasing 2 % annual temperature. A seasonal correlation coefficient between temperature and streamflow has the positive correlation in most of the sub-basins of UIB for both spring and summer. With increased 1 oC temperature in spring yields increased streamflow for rives Gilgit, Chitral, Astore, Shoyk, Shigar, Indus at Kachura & Kharmong and Hunza with percentage of 19, 5, 11, 15, 9, 7, 1 and 12 respectively. The prevailing trends and variability, caused by climate change, have an effect on the flows that should be considered by the water managers for better water management in a water scarcity country like Pakistan. On the basis of collected real time data, an awareness regarding present Integrated Water Management (IWM) working with up-to-date techniques is recommended for effective water on-going reform process.",

There is a reactive biofilm at the edges of the channel that can consume solute as it travels through the channel. While classical apporaches are able to upscale and predict the behavior at asymptotic times, preasymptotic effects will not be well represented. However depending on the timescales of flow, reaction and diffusion as characterized by dimensionless Peclet and Damkohler numbers, preasymptotic effects may be critical to accurately predicting reactive transport in such a system. We propose that an appropriately modified spatial Markov model can achieve this across a broad and representative range of geometries and dimensionless parameter values.",

            "abstract": "Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a relevant atmospheric species mainly formed by recombination of hydroperoxyl radicals. H2O2 participates in the formation of sulfate aerosol by in-cloud oxidation of S(IV) to S(VI) and has been associated with the generation of multi-functional water soluble organic compounds in atmospheric particulate matter. Furthermore, H2O2 plays an important role in the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere as it acts as a reservoir for HOx radicals (OH and HO2). Particular conditions in the Houston area (e.g. extensive presence of petrochemical industry and high ozone and humidity levels) indicate the potential relevance of this species at this location. Despite its atmospheric relevance, no reports on the levels of H2O2 in Houston have been presented previously in the scientific literature. Determination of atmospheric H2O2 usually has been conducted based on transfer of the gas-phase H2O2 to the liquid phase prior to quantification by techniques such as fluorescence spectroscopy. Although these methods allow detection of H2O2 at the sub-ppb level, they present some limitations including the interference from other atmospheric constituents and potential sampling artifacts. In this study, a high sensitivity sensor based on long-path absorption spectroscopy using a distributed-feedback quantum cascade laser was developed and used to conduct direct gas-phase H2O2 monitoring in Houston. The sensor, which targets a strong H2O2 absorption line (~7.73 µm) with no interference from other atmospheric species, was deployed at a ground level monitoring station near the University of Houston main campus during summer 2014. The performance of this novel sensor was evaluated by side-by-side comparison with a fluorescence-based instrument typically used for atmospheric monitoring of H2O2. H2O2 levels were determined, and time series of H2O2 mixing ratios were generated allowing insight into the dynamics, trends, and atmospheric inter-relations of H2O2 in the Houston area.",

However, climate change may be acerbating these impacts are causing land managers to reconsider the use and timing of management tools. However, even as new methods are being devised to combat negative drought impacts, the forest response to chronic and increasingly severe episodic drought may be changing. Historically, the weakest (e.g., suppressed, understory) trees were the first to succumb to stress while the strongest (e.g., dominant, fast growing). However, recent studies have suggested that a combination of chronic and increasingly extreme episodic stress may be causing hereunto unobserved patterns in forest mortality with the more vigorously growing trees having higher rates of mortality than slower growing, more generally stressed individuals. I suggest that the forests have not altered their response to stress, but only that the level of stress, and the forest response to that stress has not previously been observed in recorded history. This extension of the forest stress response continuum has very significant implications to forest management under drought and associated disturbance. Therefore, this paper explores the causes and implications for maintaining forest resilience and sustainability under an increasingly variable climate.",

There is an advanced tool for modeling periclinal folds. The challenge is presented in a game-like format with an emphasis on puzzle-solving that will appeal to students regardless of gender.\nFor the tour of U.S. national parks, we divided the most geologically important parks into four groups—Western Pacific, West Coast, Rockies, and East Coast. We are combining our own team’s GigaPan imagery with imagery already available on the Internet. There is a great deal of imagery just waiting to be annotated for geological education purposes.\nThe Magical Mystery Tour takes students to Google Streetview locations selected by instructors. Students are presented with questions or tasks and are given automatic feedback. Other themes are under development. Within each theme, we are crowd-sourcing contributions from colleagues and inviting colleagues to vote for or against proposed locations and student interactions.\nThe GEODE team includes the authors and: Heather Almquist, Stephen Burgin, Cinzia Cervato, Gene Cooper, Paul Karabinos, Terry Pavlis, Jen Piatek, Bill Richards, Jeff Ryan, Ron Schott, Kristen St. John, and Barb Tewksbury.",

            "abstract": "We studied seismic body wave generation from four fully contained explosions of approximately the same yields (68 kg of TNT equivalent) conducted in anisotropic granite in Barre, VT. The explosions were detonated using three types of explosives with different velocities of detonation (VOD): Black Powder (BP), Ammonium Nitrate Fuel Oil/Emulsion (ANFO), and Composition B (COMP B). The main objective of the experiment was to study differences in seismic wave generation among different types of explosives, and to determine the mechanism responsible for these differences.\nThe explosives with slow burn rate (BP) produced lower P-wave amplitude and lower corner frequency, which resulted in lower seismic efficiency (0.35%) in comparison with high burn rate explosives (2.2% for ANFO and 3% for COMP B). The seismic efficiency estimates for ANFO and COMP B agree with previous studies for nuclear explosions in granite. The body wave radiation pattern is consistent with an isotropic explosion with an added azimuthal component caused by vertical tensile fractures oriented along pre-existing micro-fracturing in the granite, although the complexities in the P- and S-wave radiation patterns suggest that more than one fracture orientation could be responsible for their generation. High S/P amplitude ratios and low P-wave amplitudes suggest that a significant fraction of the BP source mechanism can be explained by opening of the tensile fractures as a result of the slow energy release.",

To understand why, we have to see how the atmosphere behaved over this period, and the atmosphere is a complex, non-linear system of many inter-related variables. Modern observing and weather forecasting systems provide a detailed and precise reconstruction of the atmospheric state, but to interpret and communicate the resulting mass of information we need to visualise it. This visualisation is a technical challenge in data handling and programming, and a design challenge in choosing projections, length-scales, colour schemes and variable sets to make video diagnostics that illustrate the important points.\n2013/14 is well observed, but to study climate change we need to compare it to much more uncertain reconstructions of similar events in previous years. By using fog as a visual metaphor for uncertainty we can flag uncertain areas in visualisations, illustrate the relationship between weather reconstructions and the raw observations they are based on, and target efforts to improve historical reconstructions.",

            "abstract": "In the active tectonic regions, shear zones play an important role to re-configure the structure of the lithosphere. One of the largest shear zones on the Earth is the Najd Fault System of the Arabian-Nubian Shield. Literature data record the main active phase of this shear zone during the last stages of the Pan-African Orogeny (ca. 630 - 540 Ma). The Najd Fault System is composed of several shear zone segments, one of them is the Ajjaj shear zone. Determination of the age of variably deformed intrusions is expected to give approximated age of deformation in Ajjaj shear zone. Six samples of intrusive rocks showing variable composition were used to illustrate the time progress and evolution of the Ajjaj shear zone. One sample is from a very coarse grained diorite lying within the Ajjaj shear zone. It has very weak deformation and produces an intercept U-Pb zircon age of 696 ± 6 Ma. Two samples are from granodiorite-tonalite intrusions to the tenant of the Ajjaj shear zones. They show conspicuous degree of deformation and define two U-Pb clusters of concordia ages at 747 ± 12 Ma - 668 ± 8 Ma and 742 ± 5 Ma - 702 ± 12 Ma. Three samples are granites from variable plutons along the Ajjaj shear zone. Two of them show mylonitic foliation of flattened quartz and platy minerals such as biotite parallel to the main deformation trend of the shear zone. They yield U-Pb ages of 601 ± 6 Ma - 584 ± 3 Ma. The third sample is undeformed and has a cross-cut contact relationship with the foliation of the Ajjaj shear zone. It yield concordia ages of 581 ± 4 Ma. These data confine the activity of the Ajjaj shear zone to a limited period between 605 Ma and 577 Ma. As the activity of the Ajjaj shear zone was responsible for the exhumation of the Hamadat metamorphic complex, we also constrained the vertical motions that occurred during the shear zone activity using mmetamorphic rocks. It is shown that peak metamorphism occurred around 505 - 700 ºC at two ranges of pressure 8 - 11 and 14.5 ± 2 kbar with highest pressure rocks being central to the shear zone and lower pressure occurring in more distal parts. This suggests exhumation from about 44 - 58 depth with the largest exhumation depths occurring in the most central part of the shear zone.",

            "abstract": "Satellite observations show that energetic (>100 keV) O+ ions are rapidly increased in the inner magnetosphere during substorms. The ultimate source of O+ ions is the Earth’s ionosphere, so that O+ ions must be accelerated from ~eV to 100s keV somewhere in the magnetosphere. A fundamental question still arise regarding why O+ ions are accelerated and transported to the inner magnetosphere. We simulated substorms under two different solar wind conditions by using the global MHD simulation developed by Tanaka et al. (2010, JGR). The solar wind speed is set to be 372 km/s for Case I, and 500 km/s for Case II. In both cases, the MHD simulation result shows that the dawn to dusk electric field is enhanced in the night side tail region at >7 Re just after the substorm onset. In particular, the electric field in the inner region (~7 Re) is highly enhanced by the tension force because of relatively strong magnetic field together with curved field lines. The strongest electric field takes place near the region where the plasma pressure is high. We performed test particle simulation under the electric and magnetic fields for Cases I and II. O+ ions are released from two planes located at ±2 Re in the Z direction in the tail region. O+ ions released at the two planes represent outflowing stream of O+ ions escaping from the Earth. The distribution function at the planes is assumed to be drifting Kappa distribution with temperature of 10 eV, the density of 105 m-3, and the parallel velocity given by the MHD simulation. In total, around a billion of particles are traced. Each test particle carries the real number of particles in accordance with the Liouville theorem. After tracing particles, we reconstructed 6-dimensional phase space density of O+ ions. We obtained the following results. (1) Just after substorm onset, the differential flux of O+ ions is almost simultaneously enhanced in the region where the electric field is strong. (2) The kinetic energy increases rapidly to 120 keV for Case I, and 200 keV Case II in the inner magnetosphere. (3) On the dayside, the pitch angle anisotropy of O+ ions increases with radial distance. We will discuss the acceleration processes and generation mechanisms of pitch angle anisotropy of O+ ions in more detail, and the overall contribution to the ring current.",

We determined high quality focal plane solutions of 490 events, using at least 6 stations (normally >10 stations) with a good station distribution around the epicenters. In the southern Dead Sea basin and adjacent regions there are several clusters of earthquakes. Most of the activity occurred along the eastern bordering fault of the basin, in the Lisan Peninsula and just south and north of it. Along the eastern and western bordering faults we observe mainly strike slip mechanism, probably supporting the left lateral motion along the Dead Sea fault. The nodal planes of many of focal mechanisms inside the basin are parallel to the transverse faults crossing the basin, i.e., Bokek and Ein-Gedi faults, and also parallel to faults that border the Lisan Peninsula on the north-western and south-western sides.",

            "abstract": "Although many continental rift basins and their successfully rifted counterparts at passive continental margins are magmatic, some are not. This dichotomy prompted end-member views of the mechanism driving continental rifting, deep-seated and mantle plume-driven for some, owing to shallow lithospheric stretching for others. In that regard, the East African Rift (EAR), the 3000 km-long divergent boundary between the Nubian and Somalian plates, provides a unique setting with the juxtaposition of the eastern, magma-rich, and western, magma-poor, branches on either sides of the 250-km thick Tanzanian craton. Here we implement high-resolution rheologically realistic 3D numerical model of plume-lithosphere interactions in extensional far-field settings to explain this contrasted behaviour in a unified framework starting from simple, symmetrical initial conditions with an isolated mantle plume rising beneath a craton in an east-west tensional far field stress. The upwelling mantle plume is deflected by the cratonic keel and preferentially channelled along one of its sides. This leads to the coeval development of a magma-rich branch above the plume head and a magma-poor one along the opposite side of the craton, the formation of a rotating microplate between the two rift branches, and the feeding of melt to both branches form a single mantle source. The model bears strong similarities with the evolution of the eastern and western branches of the central EAR and the geodetically observed rotation of the Victoria microplate. This result reconciles the passive (plume-activated) versus active (far-field tectonic stresses) rift models as our experiments shows both processes in action and demonstrate the possibility of developing both magmatic and amagmatic rifts in identical geotectonic environments.",

            "abstract": "The broad goal of this presentation is to demonstrate the utility of probabilistic generative models to capture investigators’ knowledge of geological processes and proxy data to draw statistical inferences about unobserved paleoclimatological events. We illustrate how this approach forces investigators to be explicit about their assumptions, and about how probability theory yields results that are a mathematical consequence of these assumptions and the data. We illustrate these ideas with the HMM-Match model that infers common times of sediment deposition in two records and the uncertainty in these inferences in the form of confidence bands. HMM-Match models the sedimentation processes that led to proxy data measured in marine sediment cores. This Bayesian model has three components:\n1) a generative probabilistic model that proceeds from the underlying geophysical and geochemical events, specifically the sedimentation events to the generation the proxy data\nSedimentation ---> Proxy Data\n; 2) a recursive algorithm that reverses the logic of the model to yield inference about the unobserved sedimentation events and the associated alignment of the records based on proxy data\nProxy Data ---> Sedimentation (Alignment)\n; 3) an expectation maximization algorithm for estimating two unknown parameters.\nWe applied HMM-Match to align 35 Late Pleistocene records to a global benthic d18Ostack and found that the mean width of 95% confidence intervals varies between 3-23 kyr depending on the resolution and noisiness of the core’s d18O signal. Confidence bands within individual cores also vary greatly, ranging from ~0 to >40 kyr. Results from this algorithm will allow researchers to examine the robustness of their conclusions with respect to alignment uncertainty. Figure 1 shows the confidence bands for one low resolution record.",

Our study focuses on characterizing the modulation of heavy rainfall in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region by the MJO, using the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) global High Resolution Atmospheric Model (HIRAM) simulations (25-km; 1979-2012) and a combination of available atmospheric products from satellite, in-situ and reanalysis data. The observed Hadley Centre Global Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature (HadISST) and the simulated SST from GFDL’s global coupled carbon–climate Earth System Models (ESM2M) are employed in HIRAM to investigate the sensitivity of the simulated heavy rainfall and MJO to SST. The future trend of the extreme rainfalls and their links to the MJO response to climate change are examined using HIRAM simulations of 2012-2050 with the RCP4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios to advance the possibility of characterization and forecasting of future extreme rainfall events in the MENA region.",

The aim of this study is to determine the true value of C as a function of Sw.\nWe determine the relative permeability (kr), resistivity index (I) and relative coupling coefficient (Cr = C(Sw)/C(Sw=1)) using numerical simulation and optimization to minimize the difference between observed and simulated values. The relative streaming charge transported by the flow of water\nQrw(Sw)=Qw(Sw)/Qw(Sw=1)=Cr(Sw)/I(Sw)Kr(Sw) (1)\nis constrained to vary monotonically during drainage and imbibition.\nWe obtain 160 and 320 solutions for the saturation dependence of Cr during drainage and imbibition respectively, which yield a similar quality of match. We find that Cr (i) exhibits hysteresis between drainage and imbibition, (ii) can vary non-monotonically with saturation, (iii) can be non-zero at the irreducible water saturation, (iv) can exceed the value observed at Sw=1, and (v) varies over a wide range. However, the corresponding variation in Qrw is relatively narrow. A reasonable model for Qrw is Qrw(Sw)=a[(Sw-Swr)/(1-Snwr-Swr)]^b+c (2)\nwhere a, b and c are determined from experimental data (a+c=1) and Swr, Snwr are the residual phase saturations after drainage and imbibition. Values for a, b and c obtained here are similar for both rock samples for a given displacement, but differ significantly between drainage and imbibition. The saturation dependence of Qrw is not given by 1/Sw as suggested in previous studies and Cr can exhibit complex, non-monotonic behaviour, depending upon the physically meaningful (monotonic) saturation dependence of the other parameters in (1). The saturation dependence of the streaming potential is best determined by fitting models for krw, I  and Qrw to experimental data.\nVinogradov, J. and Jackson, M.D. (2011), Geophys. Res.

RAFLES represents both drag and volume restriction by the canopy over an explicit 3-D domain. We conducted a sensitivity analysis of uplift and circulation patterns at the front and back of a rectangular barrier to the representation of the canopy volume. We then used this model to perform a virtual experiment using combinations of realistic heterogeneous canopies and virtual homogenous canopies combined with heterogeneous and homogenous patterns of soil moisture to test the effects of the spatial scaling of soil moisture on the fluxes of momentum, heat, and water in heterogeneous environments at the tree-crown scale. Further simulations were performed to test the combined effects of canopy structure, soil moisture heterogeneity, and soil water availability. We found flux dynamics of momentum, heat, and water to be significantly influenced by canopy structure, soil moisture heterogeneity, and soil water availability. During non-plant-limiting soil-water conditions, we found canopy structure to be the primary driver of tree-crown scale fluxes of momentum, heat, and water, specifically through modification of the ejection sweep dynamics. However, as soil water conditions became limiting for latent heat flux from plants, tree-crown scale fluxes of momentum and heat became influenced by the spatial pattern of soil moisture, whereas soil moisture became a significant driver of tree-crown scale fluxes of water along with canopy structure.",

            "abstract": "Investigating the factors that influence magma flow dynamics within intrusions is important for understanding how magma migrates through the crust and erupts at the surface. Studying extinct volcanoes where erosion has exposed their plumbing systems provides insights into the final stages of magma movement. Fieldwork was conducted on the Isles of Mull and Skye, Western Scotland to study how magma flow is preserved within intrusions. On the Isle of Mull, 2-8m thick tholeiitic dolerite sills of the Loch Scridain Sill Complex (c.58Ma), crop out along the northern and southern coasts of the Ross of Mull, intruding into Paleogene lavas (c.60Ma) and Moine Supergroup Psammites respectively. Large columnar jointing is present perpendicular to the sill margins and is cross cut by arcuate fracture planes with parallel vesicle concentrations. Raised lineations were found on planar surfaces striking in similar directions to the arcuate fractures. These lineations have a range in strike from 148° to 172° and are inferred to be magma flow indicators. On the Isle of Skye, fieldwork was conducted in a disused quarry at Invertote where stacked olivine dolerite sills from the Little Minch Sill Complex (c.60Ma) intrude into Jurassic sediments. The sills are 0.5 to 8m thick, their contacts being defined by contrasts in jointing frequency, crystal layering, occurrence of gabbro lenses and variations in mineral proportion, size and composition. A series of five distinct sills crop out, with two N-S striking dikes cross-cutting the site. Pahoehoe ropes were found preserved on exposed contacts of one dike, which helped to infer the magma flow direction. Detailed sampling was carried out and petrographic thin sections analysed to describe the crystalline fabrics across the length and breadth of the intrusions. The results of the petrographic study are compared with magnetic fabrics from AMS and AARM analysis techniques to provide an independent quantification of flow trajectories.",

            "abstract": "Over the last decades, dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) contamination in the subsurface increases with the rapid development of oil industry and becomes the focus of many studies. The migration, distribution and remediation efficiency of DNAPLs in the subsurface environment are greatly affected by the solution chemistry besides the physical heterogeneities of aquifers. Humic acid (HA), which is ubiquitous in natural environments, is a surface active substance exhibiting solubility enhancement behavior for hydrophobic organic compounds such as DNAPLs. Here we reported a laboratory investigation to study the effects of HA on the infiltration, immobilization and subsequent recovery of DNAPL in porous media.\nTetrachloroethylene (PCE) was selected as the representative DNAPL in this study. Two-dimensional (2-D) sandbox experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of different HA concentrations on the transport, distribution of PCE and the remediation of PCE using surfactant (Tween 80) flushing in a saturated porous media system. The surfactant flushing of PCE was performed after the PCE transport and distribution had reached equilibrium. A light transmission visualization method with charge-coupled device (CCD) camera was adopted to visualize PCE distribution and quantify its saturation. In addition, the experiments were also designed to gather data for the validation of multiphase flow models. Effluent samples were collected to determine dissolved PCE concentrations. PCE solubilization and PCE-water interfacial tension were experimentally determined in aqueous solutions of varying HA concentrations. The experimental results showed that the presence of HA can have a dramatic impact on PCE flow and entrapment, and significantly improved the recovery of PCE during surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation (SEAR). The findings are of use for better understanding of the migration and entrapment of DNAPLs and developing of SEAR technology.",

            "abstract": "Records of bedrock river incision are commonly used to infer rock uplift under the assumption that rates of these two processes match over the long term (>105 yrs). A recent compilation of 14 bedrock river incision records, however, illustrates a dependence of rate on measured interval on time scales approaching 107 yrs, a characteristic that we term the fluvial Sadler effect. The process(es) responsible for such a fluvial Sadler effect over long time scales is unknown, but it is argued to arise because hiatuses in fluvial incision follow a stochastic, heavy-tailed distribution. If correct, linking river incision and rock uplift becomes more complicated than previously thought. Motivated by pervasive evidence in support of non-stochastic, quasi-cyclic climate forcing as modulating rates of bedrock river incision, we explore the degree to which the fluvial Sadler effect may instead arise by such deterministic forcing. We demonstrate that river incision rate is inherently a time dependent measurement, because the reference frame from which it is calculated (the river profile) is dynamic and not fixed with respect to the geoid. Out of necessity, the modern river profile is often used to calculate river incision. Even when uplift is steady and uniform and incision is modulated by quasi-cyclic, deterministic forcing, the use of this static reference systematically biases calculations of river incision producing a dependence of rate on measured interval that is similar to expectations for a stochastic, heavy-tailed distribution. In such cases, the fluvial Sadler effect persists at all time scales, but is largely minimized at times greater than one period of the longest quasi-cyclic forcing. We conclude that bedrock river incision rate, when modulated by deterministic climatic forcing, provides a reliable proxy for rock uplift rate given integration across at least one glacial-interglacial cycle (>105 yrs) and consideration of the correct local base level datum.",

            "abstract": "Melting and crystallization of magma ocean(s) during the evolution of the early Earth may have led to extensive chemical differentiation. Some of the resulting mantle heterogeneities might have survived convective mixing and remained chemically distinctive, possibly residing today at the base of the lower mantle. To gain insights into the origin, composition and properties of these possible lower mantle heterogeneities, we are investigating melting phase relations on compositions in the binary MgO-SiO2 (MS) and ternary CaO-MgO-SiO2(CMS) systems at lower mantle pressures, using the laser-heated diamond anvil cell (LH-DAC) technique. An important objective of this study is to determine the effect of pressure on invariant melt compositions involving the following liquidus mineral assemblages, corresponding to peridotitic and basaltic model compositions:\n1. Mg-perovskite (mgpv) + periclase (pc) and mgpv + silica in the MS-system.\n2. Mgpv + pc + Ca-perovskite (capv) and mgpv + capv + silica in the CMS-system.\nTwo methodologies were developed in order to explore melting relations under high pressure conditions. Firstly, exploratory experiments were performed to investigate invariant melting temperatures (Tm) using postulated near-eutectic compositions. Secondly, in order to greatly reduce temperature gradients compared to conventional LH-DAC experiments, a novel technique for micro-fabrication of metal-encapsulated samples has been developed. The selected near-eutectic compositions show an expected positive P-Tm correlation, with lower Tm for the CMS-system. Our preliminary results indicate that the dTm/dP slope for the pv-silica eutectic is lower than for the pv-pc eutectic in the MS-system. Overall, there is good agreement between our results and the results of simulations based on density functional theory(1) and thermodynamic extrapolations of experimental data at lower pressures(2).\n",

Unlike previous cometary missions, Rosetta is not a flyby, limited to taking a snapshot of the comet at a single heliocentric distance. Instead, Rosetta intercepted the comet prior to the onset of major activity and will chart its evolution during its perihelion passage and beyond.\nSuch a unique mission requires a unique payload; as well as the more typical remote sensing instruments, Rosetta also carries sensors to sample in situ the gas and dust environment. One of these instruments is MIDAS, an atomic force microscope designed to collect dust and image it in three dimensions with nanometre resolution. Equipped with an array of sharp tips, four of which are magnetised to allow magnetic force microscopy, MIDAS exposes targets to the incident flux after which they are moved to the microscope for analysis.\nAs well as extending coverage of the dust size distribution down to the finest particles, MIDAS has the unique capability to determine the shape of pristine particles - to determine, for example, if they are compact or fluffy, and to look for features which may be diagnostic of their formation environment or evolution. The magnetic mode lets MIDAS probe samples for magnetic material and to map its location if present.\nHaving been operating almost continuously after hibernation imaging empty targets before exposure, the first exposures were performed when Rosetta entered 30 km bound orbits. The first MIDAS images and analyses of collected dust grains are presented here.",

Examples from the Nankai Trough and the Beppu Bay suggest that a terminal isolated depression is area with the highest potential for the deposition of fine-grained turbidites. The 2004 off the Kii Peninsula earthquakes caused a fine-grained turbidite deposited in a small basin on the Nankai accretionary prism slope, and formed a thick acoustically transparent layer. Off Sanriku thickness of the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake and tsunami event beds was usually a few-several cm, but was highest in the Japan Trench with several tens cm. The Japan Trench floor is the deepest and terminal basin. The terminal basin is a potential area for marine paleoseismology. Preservation potential is a factor for usage of submarine event beds as paleoseimsological tool. Repeated sampling of surface sediments from off Sanriku after the 2011 event suggests that the preservation potential of fine-grained event bed is low in the strong benthos activity zone. Sedimentation rate is another factor on the preservation potential. Quick and high sediment accumulation after the event bed deposition diminishes the pressure for the destruction of the event beds by benthos activity. Thus, a small basin covered by the bottom water with low dissolved oxygen concentration, and occurred under the high primary productivity areas is a good example of basins with high preservation potential of event beds. High resolution seismic profiles in the central Japan Trench indicate that occurrence of the well-stratified strata filling the trench and subducting graben depressions. These strata have high potential for seismo-turbidite deposition. Thus, small basins on the mid-slope terrace and the trench floor of the central Japan Trench are most preferable and potential candidates for submarine paleoseismology.",

            "abstract": "Seafloor geodetic data, i.e. GPS/acoustic measurement and continuous seafloor pressure monitoring, brought important evidences showing that the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake (Mw 9.0) caused huge (> 50 m) coseismic slip near the Japan Trench. The postseismic behavior of the large slipped area is required to clarify to understand why large amount seismic slip could occur there. We started making direct-path acoustic ranging across the trench axis to reveal the convergence rate between the subducting Pacific and overriding continental plates. We expect the change of the baseline length across the trench axis, the plate boundary, reflects the slip rate at the shallow megathrust, which is difficult to estimate only from other geodetic observations largely affected by intraplate deformation caused by the postseismic viscoelastic relaxation process.\nTo this end, we developed an ultra-deep seafloor acoustic ranging system. Our previous ranging systems have been designed to measure baseline length ~ 1 km and to be deployed up to 7,000 m water-depth (Osada et al., 2008, 2012). In order to realize the measurement across the Japan Trench, we improved this system to enhance range of acoustic ranging as well as operational depth of instruments. The improved system was designed to allow acoustic ranging up to 3 km and to be durable under the high-pressure equivalent to water depth of 9,000 m. In May 2013, we carried out a test deployment of the new ranging system. The system is composed of three seafloor instruments equipped with precision transponder (PXPs). Two of the PXPs were set on the landward slope of the Japan Trench, where large coseismic slip happened in 2011. Another PXP was deployed on the seaward side of the trench so that the baseline change associated with the slip on the plate boundary fault, if any, can be detected. Continuous records of baseline lengths were successfully obtained for four months. The repeatability of the distance measurements was about 20 mm for each of the two baselines. Although the duration of the observation was not long enough to estimate precise rate of baseline length changes, it is unlikely that the shortening rates of the baseline lengths exceed the rate of plate convergence (~ 8 cm/a). The results do not support occurrence of evident afterslip along the shallow plate boundary fault in 2013.",

            "abstract": "Strain partitioning is observed along various subduction zones where plate convergence is oblique to the trench. If no slip partitioning occurs, the slip vectors coincide with the plate convergence direction, whereas for full partitioning the azimuths of the vectors fall along the trench normal direction. Strain partitioning can have an influence on the deformation that remains after a complete cycle and on the seismotectonic segmentation of a margin. Before, during and after the Maule 2010 earthquake the forearc was densely monitored by seismological and geodetic networks allowing to investigate strain partitioning, its causes and its consequences on the stress regime during the inter-, co- and postseismic phases.\nWe examine azimuths from displacements from GPS stations and focal mechanisms along the Maule 2010 rupture. Since the focal mechanisms are related to the principal stress axes and the GPS stations measure the displacement on the surface, they provide independent constraint to quantify the variation in time of the strain partitioning. The azimuthal information from seismicity and GPS is used to characterize the phases of the seismic cycle along the Maule 2010 rupture zone by looking at data from the inter-, co- and postseismic phase. Results show that the mean azimuth direction of the postseismic and coseismic displacement differs approximately 10° with the postseismic displacement directions have a smaller trench parallel component. Larger aftershocks occur mostly offshore or close to the shoreline and show the tendency to point more to the plate convergence direction with increasing distance from the trench. During the postseismic phase, vectors rotate clockwise approaching the plate convergence direction, which may be an indicator of the relocking of the plate interface. Comparing the azimuths of GPS vectors for the interseismic and coseismic phase the data suggests a change in the partitioning behaviour of the incoming plate convergence vector for both, seismic phases and increasing distance to the trench. Similar observations in other subduction zones were previously interpreted as change in the partitioning behaviour. However, rotational effects, internal deformation of the forearc, heterogeneous coupling of the plate interface need to be considered.",

            "abstract": "Compressional forces at convergent margins govern a variety of processes, most prominently earthquakes, landslides and mud volcanoes in the forearc. Although all seem related to fluid pressure changes, mud volcanoes are not only characterized by expulsion of fluids, but also fluidized mud and clasts that got ripped-up during mud ascension. They hence provide information regarding mobilization depth, diagenetic overprint, and geodynamic pathways.\nAt the Nankai Trough subduction zone, SE offshore Japan, mud volcanism id common and supposed to be related to seismogenic processes. During MARUM Expedition SO-222 with R/V SONNE, mud volcanoes in the Kumano forearc basin were mapped, cored and sampled. By extending the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Kumano transect landwards, 5 new mud volcanoes were identified by multibeam mapping. Cores revealed mud breccia with semi-consolidated silt- to claystone clasts and gaseous fluid escape structures, while the hemipelagic background sediments are characterized by intercalations of turbidites, ash layers and calcareous fossils. Clasts were subject to thin-section analyses, and the cores were sampled for XRD analyses and radiocarbon dating. Clasts showed prominent deformation structures, neomorphism and pores and fractures filled with polycrystalline quartz and/or calcite cement, probably formed during deep burial and early metamorphosis. Illite crystallinity based on XRD measurements varies between 0.24 and 0.38, which implies that the material originates from the Anchizone at depths ≥ 4 km. Radiocarbon dating revealed ages between 4450 and 30300 yr cal. BP, with age reversals occurring not earlier than 17000 yr cal. BP. Radiocarbon dating beneath turbidites and ash layers found at mud volcano #9 points to an episodic occurrence of these earthquake-related features in intervals of ca. 620 yr, while the mud volcano itself remained inactive.\nIn summary, the preliminary results suggest that the mud volcanoes are nurtured from a reservoir within the older part of the accretionary prism, but that mud volcanic activity is less frequent than major earthquakes. Future models will focus on source depth and temperature, and might elucidate the prerequisites for fluid migration and its role in seismogenesis at the Nankai Trough subduction zone.",

            "abstract": "Coral based reconstructions of sea surface temperatures (SST) using Sr/Ca, U/Ca and δ18O ratios are an important tool for quantitative reconstructions of past climate. However, post-depositional alteration of coral aragonite due to early diagenesis is restricting the accuracy of calibrated proxies even on relatively young corals. Here we present Mid to Late Holocene SST reconstructions using well dated (U/Th: ~70yr to 5.4ka) fossil Porites collected from the Society Islands, French Polynesia. Microscopic observations and microprobe mapping show the presence of aragonite needles inside the coral pores. They are characterized by high Sr/Ca ratios of up to 14.7±0.3mmol/mol, shifting the corresponding SST to ~6.2±1.1°C. Inhomogeneous distribution of Sr/Ca reflects partial dissolution, pore fluid percolation and re-precipitation of Sr within the coral. The resulting effect of early diagenesis on the SST records is reflected by significant temperature offsets up to ±6°C. A relative SST reconstruction is still feasible by normalizing the records to their individual mean value. Latter approach shows that all three records are in phase with simultaneous SST variability of up to ±2.4°C with respect to the Holocene mean value. Low SSTs are observed between ~4.4 to ~4.9ka BP and ~2.8 to ~3.4ka BP. Relatively high temperatures are observed at ~5ka BP, between ~3.7 and 3.9ka BP as well as at ~1.8ka BP to ~2.6ka BP. This indicates SST oscillations with the periodicity of 1500yrs in the Society island record which is in general accord with the solar activity reconstructed from 10Be and 14C production (Vonmoos et al., 2006, JGR 111, A10105). In particular, the relatively high SST reconcile empirically determined sea level variations (Rashid et al., 2014, G3, 15) indicating a higher sea level than predicted from numerical modelling taking only “Glacial Isostatic Adjustment” into account as the primary controlling factor for the Late Holocene sea level variation.",

            "abstract": "Peridotite constitutes most of the Earth’s upper mantle, and it is therefore unsurprising that most mantle-derived magmas exhibit evidence of past equilibrium with olivine-dominated source. There is mounting evidence, however, for the role of pyroxenite in magma generation within upwelling mantle plumes; a less documented non-peridotite source of melts are metasomatic veins (metasomes) within the lithospheric mantle. Melts derived from metasomes may exhibit extreme enrichment or depletion in major and trace elements. We hypothesize that phenocrysts such as olivine, which are commonly used to probe basalt source lithology, will reflect these unusual geochemical signals. Here we present preliminary major and trace element analyses of 60 lavas erupted from a small Miocene shield volcano located within the Ethiopian flood basalt province. Erupted lavas are intercalated with lahars and pyroclastic horizons that are overlain by a later stage of activity manifested in small cinder cones and flows. The lavas form two distinctive petrographic and geochemical groups: (A) an olivine-phyric, low Ti group (1.7-2.7 wt. % TiO2; 4.0-13.6 wt. % MgO), which geochemically resembles most of the basalts in the region. These low Ti lavas are the only geochemical unit identified in the later cinder cones and associated lava flows. (B) a clinopyroxene-phyric high Ti group (1-6.7 wt. % TiO2; 1.0-9.5 wt. % MgO), which resembles the Oligocene HT-2 flood basalts. This unit is found intercalated with low Ti lavas within the Miocene shield. In comparison to the low Ti group, the high Ti lavas exhibit a profound depletion in Ni, Cr, Al, and Si, and significant enrichment in Ca, Fe, V, and the most incompatible trace elements. When combined with a diagnostic negative K anomaly in primitive-mantle normalized diagrams and Na2O>K2O, the geochemical data point towards a source which is rich in amphibole, devoid of olivine, and perhaps containing some carbonate. Our preliminary results have identified a large suite of primitive lavas derived from a nominally olivine-free mantle source. Consequently, our future work will examine olivine geochemical characteristics and constrain the compositional space for these unusual mantle lithologies.",

Both instruments are based on a zone plate having 4 mm outer diameter and 1 to 2 degree field of view. The zone plate collects EUV radiation and focuses a narrow bandpass through a pinhole aperture and onto a silicon photodiode detector.\nAs a miniature radiometer, EUV irradiance is accurately determined from the zone plate efficiency and the photodiode responsivity that are calibrated at the NIST SURF synchrotron facility. The EUV radiometer is pointed to the Sun and measures the absolute solar EUV irradiance in high time cadence suitable for solar physics and space weather applications.\nAs a limb-scanning instrument in low earth orbit, a miniature zone-plate monochromator measures the extinction of solar EUV radiation by scattering through the upper atmosphere which is a measure of the variability of the ionosphere.\nBoth instruments are compact and light-weight and are attractive for CubeSats and other missions where resources are extremely limited.",

This is achieved by the combined measurement of the energy-per-charge, the time-of-flight and the energy of the incident ions. The CTOF instrument combines a remarkable time-of-flight resolution with a large effective area which allows to determine the velocity distributions of a wide range of heavy ions with 5 minute cadence. Based on a sophisticated in-flight calibration and count rate analysis we derived 5-minute velocity distributions for typical charge states of solar wind carbon, oxygen, silicon and iron for the CTOF measurement period between day of year 150 and 220 in 1996. In contrast to previous studies we used pure Pulse Height Analysis (PHA) data, which yields the full mass and mass-per-charge and velocity information. We analyzed the velocity spectra for differential streaming relative to the solar wind bulk proton speed, measured simultaneously with the CELIAS Proton Monitor (PM). Here we present our results which should provide experimental constraints for theories of resonant wave-particle interaction and preferential acceleration of heavy ions in the solar wind.",

            "abstract": "The sources, magnitudes, and impacts of non-linear advective accelerations on alongshore surfzone currents are investigated with observations and a numerical model. Previous numerical modeling results have indicated that advective accelerations are an important contribution to the alongshore force balance, and are required to understand spatial variations in alongshore currents (which may result in spatially variable morphological change). However, most prior observational studies have neglected advective accelerations in the alongshore force balance. Using a numerical model (Delft3D) to predict optimal sensor locations, a dense array of 26 colocated current meters and pressure sensors was deployed between the shoreline and 3-m water depth over a 200 by 115 m region near Duck, NC in fall 2013. The array included 7 cross- and 3 alongshore transects. Here, observational and numerical estimates of the dominant forcing terms in the alongshore balance (pressure and radiation-stress gradients) and the advective acceleration terms will be compared with each other. In addition, the numerical model will be used to examine the force balance, including sources of velocity gradients, at a higher spatial resolution than possible with the instrument array. Preliminary numerical results indicate that at O(10-100 m) alongshore scales, bathymetric variations and the ensuing alongshore variations in the wave field and subsequent forcing are the dominant sources of the modeled velocity gradients and advective accelerations. Additional simulations and analysis of the observations will be presented. Funded by NSF and ASDR&E.",

            "abstract": "The Siberian flood basalt (SFB) province is the largest terrestrial province with the estimated volume of igneous rocks up to 5 million cubic km. The majority of SFB erupted over less than one million years at 251 Ma. The main epochs of kimberlites emplacement took place in Devonian (344-364 Ma) producing principal diamond mines including Udachnaya mine and in Triassic (about 240 Ma) with only one, Malokuonapskaya kimberlite pipe with near-commercial diamond grade. This indicates the availability of complete lithospheric cross section. It contains flood basalt and peridotite xenoliths. We report here preliminary data on mineralogy of this hypabyssal kimberlite containing fresh olivine. Homogeneous cores of zoned olivine with Fo 78.5-93 are different in compositional range from those of Udachnaya olivines (Fo 85-94). Outer rims composition are also different (Fo 85-86 and 89-90 respectively). Concentration of Ni, Mn, Co, Ca, Cr, Al, Ti, P, Na and Zn were measured by EPMA using an innovative method which has been developed based on earlier publication (Sobolev et al., Science, 2007, 316: 412-417). It made possible to obtain external precision down to 10 ppm (2SD) and detection limit down to 2 ppm. High resolution compositional maps of olivine zoning for all mentioned elements are produced. “Hot cathode” CL microscope was applied for study of luminescent minerals including calcite, apatite and baryte. Twenty percent of representative olivine samples are characterized by low Fo 78.5-85 and NiO from 600 to 2300 ppm. Clear zoning in concentration of some trace elements, P in particular, is detected in the cores of studied olivines. Ba-phlogopite containing BaO from less than 1 up to 14.5 wt.% is another specific feature of Malokuonapskaya kimberlite, which is different from any kimberlites and especially from Udachnaya with highest BaO – 4.85 wt.% of its phlogopite. Chromediopsides contain 1.3 - 5.2 wt.% FeO, 0.6 - 2.0 wt.% Cr2O3 and 0.45 - 2.0 wt.% Na2O. Pyropes including subcalcic Cr-pyropes are detected. Picroilmenites containing up to 18 wt.% MgO and 3.0 wt.% Cr2O3 are present along with perovskite, chromite and ulvospinel. The difference in mineralogy of hypabyssal kimberlites predated (Devonian) and postdated (Triassic) SFB may suggest recorded effect of SFB on Siberian lithosphere.",

            "abstract": "As they propagate through the heliosphere, Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) are modulated by various effects before they are detected at Earth. This transport can be described by the Parker equation (Parker, 1965). It calculates the phase space distribution of GCRs depending on the main modulation processes: convection, drifts, diffusion and adiabatic energy changes. A first order approximation of this equation is the force field approach, reducing it to a one-parameter dependency, the solar modulation potential. Utilizing this approach, Usoskin et al. (2005; 2011) reconstructed the solar modulation potential between 1936 and 2010, which by now is commonly used in many fields. However, it has been shown previously e.g. by Herbst et al. (2010) that the solar modulation potential depends not only on the Local Interstellar Spectrum (LIS) but also on the energy range of interest. Using the LIS by Usoskin et al. (2005) together with published proton intensity spectra obtained by PAMELA as well as neutron monitor and spacecraft measurements, we have investigated this energy dependence further. As expected, the results show severe limitations at lower energies including a strong dependence on the solar magnetic epoch. Based on these results, we will present a tool to describe GCR proton spectra in the energy range from a few hundred MeV to 40 GeV over the last four solar cycles.",

Our work was dedicated to the estimation of dynamics and duration of magmatic activity during Siberian Traps emplacement. The conclusions are based on paleomagnetic study of large dolerite sills in the periphery of Siberian Trap province, tuffaceous deposits, small intrusions and lava flows of Tunguska syncline, and on geochronological data (Ivanov et al., 2013; Reichow et al., 2009). The presented data show that formation of Siberian Traps in these regions took place as several short bursts of magmatic activity led to large sill intrusions and eruptions of tuffs. This data are in agreement with the pulsating character of magmatic activity in the Northern part of Siberian platform (Pavlov et al., 2014). The most powerful burst of magmatic activity in Angara-Taseeva syncline is supposed to be synchronous to the main phase of volcanic eruptions in the Northern part of Siberian platform and emplacement of ore-bearing intrusions in Noril’sk district.\nThis study was funded by grant RFBR # 14-05-31447.",

            "abstract": "We investigate near field ground motion variability due to five different kinematic rupture models for 1992 Landers earthquake. The ground motion simulations are accomplished by solving the elasto-dynamic equations of motion using a generalized finite-difference method (Ely et al., 2008). Simulated waveforms are calibrated against near-field strong-motion recordings. We then analyze a large data-set of ground-motions from 2000 sites, binned with respect to distance and azimuth to compute mean and standard deviation of peak ground velocity (PGV). We consider 1D-velocity structures as used in the source inversions, and honor the geometrical complexity due to fault segmentation. Our simulations reveal that ground motion variability is reduced as the distance from the fault increases. Variability in the kinematic sources has considerable impact on the resulting shaking variability, although the five source models considered are derived by inversion of seismic and/or geodetic data. Simulated mean PGV and its standard deviation are comparable to empirical estimates using the ground-motion prediction equation (GMPE) of Boore and Atkinson (2008). In addition, we find that intra-event ground motion variability is large in fault-parallel and small in fault-normal direction. We also compare our simulations with and without Spudich and Chiou (2008) directivity corrections, applied to Boore and Atkinson (2008), which shows that slip heterogeneity controls near-field ground-motion variability. We further investigate the effect of slip heterogeneity by considering eleven (ten heterogeneous and one uniform) synthetic rupture models. Heterogeneous slip models are generated following the algorithm of Mai and Beroza (2002) for different correlation lengths and Hurst exponents. We then examine synthetic seismograms calculated at 1500 stations for the eleven rupture models, confirming that the distance decay of ground motion variability is due to slip heterogeneity.",

            "abstract": "One of the crucial aspects of climate policy in the near future is the design of mitigation strategies. However, we can only get information from state of the art climate models at a handful of mitigation scenarios (e.g. the SRES and RCP scenarios). In order to compare alternative strategies and their impacts using models, we need to consider the climate effects of the corresponding emission/concentration pathways for which we don’t have climate model output. Currently this is mainly done by pattern-scaling – multiplying the mean pattern of climate change by the change in the mean of the variable (e.g. temperature or precipitation) over time. A generalised alternative to pattern scaling is statistical emulation.\nA statistical emulator is a more sophisticated way of interpolating climates between a limited number of model runs. Although widely used in science for the modelling of computer experiments, the use of statistical emulators in climate science has been limited and mainly used for perturbed physics ensembles. However emulators are perfectly well suited for use with forcing conditions instead of (or as well as) model parameters. Pattern scaling is a special (very simple) case of an emulator.\nWe will show how by parameterising the forcing functions and building emulators we can predict the climate for any reasonable set of forcings (including overshoot scenarios and other ‘odd’ forcing pathways). We also set out how a ScenarioMIP type experiment would have to be configured to achieve this.",

            "abstract": "Identifying the form and nature of coastal landscape changes that may occur in response to future sea-level rise (SLR) is essential to support decision making for resource allocation that improves climate change resilience. Both natural ecosystems and the built environment are subject to these changes and require associated resilience assessments. Existing assessments of coastal change driven by SLR typically focus on two categories of coastal response: 1) inundation by flooding as the water level rises; and 2) dynamic change resulting from movement of landforms and/or ecosystems. Results from these assessments are not always straightforward to apply in a decision support context, as it can be unclear what the dominant response type may be in a given coastal setting (e.g., barrier island, headland, wetland, forest). Furthermore, an important decision support element is to capture and clearly convey the associated uncertainty of both the underlying datasets (e.g., elevation) and climate drivers (e.g., relative SLR).\nWe developed a Bayesian network model of SLR assessment that uses publicly available geospatial datasets—land cover, elevation, and vertical land movement—and their associated uncertainties to generate probabilistic predictions of those areas likely to inundate versus dynamically respond to various SLR scenarios. SLR projections were generated using multiple sources of information, including Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models. Model outputs include predictions of potential future land-surface elevation and coastal response type at landscape (>100 km) to local (5-10 km) scales for the Northeastern U.S., commensurate with decision-making needs. The probabilistic approach allows us to objectively and transparently describe prediction certainty to decision makers. From this approach, we are also able to highlight areas in which more data or knowledge may be needed to provide a stronger basis for decision making.",

            "abstract": "Soil is one of the most critical life-supporting compartments of the Biosphere. Soil provides numerous ecosystem services such as a habitat for biodiversity, water and nutrients, as well as producing food, feed, fiber and energy. To feed the rapidly growing world population in 2050, agricultural food production must be doubled using the same land resources footprint. At the same time, soil resources are threatened due to improper management and climate change. Despite the many important functions of soil, many fundamental knowledge gaps remain, regarding the role of soil biota and biodiversity on ecosystem services, the structure and dynamics of soil communities, the interplay between hydrologic and biotic processes, the quantification of soil biogeochemical processes and soil structural processes, the resilience and recovery of soils from stress, as well as the prediction of soil development and the evolution of soils in the landscape, to name a few. Soil models have long played an important role in quantifying and predicting soil processes and related ecosystem services. However, a new generation of soil models based on a whole systems approach comprising all physical, mechanical, chemical and biological processes is now required to address these critical knowledge gaps and thus contribute to the preservation of ecosystem services, improve our understanding of climate-change–feedback processes, bridge basic soil science research and management, and facilitate the communication between science and society. To meet these challenges an international community effort is required, similar to initiatives in systems biology, hydrology, and climate and crop research. Our consortium will bring together modelers and experimental soil scientists at the forefront of new technologies and approaches to characterize soils. By addressing these aims, the consortium will contribute to improve the role of soil modeling as a knowledge dissemination instrument in addressing key global issues and stimulate the development of translational research activities. This presentation will provide a compelling case for this much-needed effort, with a focus on tangible benefits to the scientific and food security communities.",

            "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that the rate of warming is amplified with elevation, so that high mountain environments are experiencing more rapid changes in temperature than at lower elevations. This “elevational-dependent warming” (EDW) has important implications for the mass balance of high altitude glaciers and associated runoff, as well as for species that reside in restricted altitudinal zones within a mountain range. Temperature change at the earth’s surface is primarily a response to the energy balance, and therefore factors which preferentially increase the net flux of energy to the surface, along an elevation gradient would lead to enhanced warming, as a function of elevation. This points to changes in albedo (primarily snow cover), clouds, water vapor and aerosols as likely candidates that drive EDW. However, detecting and attributing the causes of EDW is confounded by data limitations and the difficulties of modeling processes in complex terrain. There is a danger that we may not be monitoring some of the regions of the globe that are warming the most, and we need a strategy for future research that will reduce current uncertainties and ensure that the changes taking place in high elevation, remote regions of the planet are properly monitored.",

            "abstract": "Carbonyl sulfide (OCS) is an important trace gas in the Earth’s atmosphere. As the predominant long-lived sulfur-containing species in the troposphere it serves as main contributor to the stratospheric aerosol-layer and, thus, indirectly contributes to radiative cooling of the atmosphere. However, the relative contribution of OCS and SO2 to the Junge-layer is still in debate. Further, OCS can be used as proxy for the photosynthetic uptake of CO2 due to its similar diffusion pathways into leaves but – in contrast to CO2 - irreversible uptake. Thus, understanding of global OCS fluxes may contribute to assess gross primary productivity in the biosphere.\nIn this paper we will present observations of globally and temporally resolved distributions of OCS in the region of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere over the period 2002-2012 by MIPAS/Envisat. In this dataset various features indicating sources and sinks can be observed for the first time: a region of low OCS concentrations over central S-America and Africa exhibiting an annual cycle, elevated values at the tropopause above the monsoon region and enhanced values in the upper troposphere above the maritime continent in spring. Further, the OCS dataset is correlated with biomass burning tracers from MIPAS, like HCN, to investigate the related emissions of OCS. To interpret the observations and constrain global and regional OCS fluxes, the MIPAS OCS distributions in the UTLS are compared to various simulations with the chemistry transport model EMAC on basis of different emission scenarios",

            "abstract": "Coseismic deformation mechanisms during subduction earthquakes remained unclear other than frictional melting recorded in pseudotachylytes. However, the recent mineralogical studies in the shallow plate-boundary thrust in the Nankai subduction zone and the underplating-related duplex-fault zone in the Shimanto accretionary complex exhumed from 4–6 km depth have identified increased heating along the 2 mm-thick, clay-rich fault gouge and the few-centimeters-thick, basalt-derived ultracataclasite, respectively. The microstructures of the fault gouge are characterized by strong preferred orientation of clay particles along the gouge, while those of the ultracataclasite show the random fabric. High-velocity friction experiments were conducted on the disaggregated fault rocks under wet (water-saturated) conditions at different normal stresses, using the rotary shear frictional testing apparatus. The results show the rapid slip weakening with low peak and steady-state shear stress, and a very small slip weakening distance and fracture energy, suggesting the ease of earthquake rupture propagation through the fault materials. The steady-state shear stress is almost independent of normal stress, indicating that the gouge behaved like a fluid during high-velocity shearing. The microstructures after the experiments are marked by the development of foliated zone in the gouge layer, but the random fabric develops in the outermost region of the circular gouge layer. Given the nearly independence of steady-state shear stress on normal stress and the increase in the rotation velocity from the center of the rotation axis during the rotary shear, the change from foliated zone to non-foliated, random fabric in the circular gouge layer could represent the change from laminar to non-laminar (or turbulent) flow associated with the increase in the Reynolds number. The implications for the fault rocks are that the development of foliated and non-foliated zones may represent coseismic laminar and non-laminar flow, during which earthquake rupture can propagate easily due to fault lubrication.",

            "abstract": "Coccolithophores are the ocean’s dominant calcifying phytoplankton; they play an important, but poorly understood, role in long-term biogeochemical climatic feedbacks. Calcite producing marine organisms are likely to calcify less in a future world where higher carbon dioxide concentrations will lead to ocean acidification (OA), but coccolithophores may be the exception. In coccolithophores calcification occurs in an intracellular vesicle, where the site of calcite precipitation is buffered from the external environment and is subject to a uniquely high degree of biological control. Culture manipulation experiments mimicking the effects of OA in the laboratory have yielded empirical evidence for phenotypic plasticity, competition and evolutionary adaptation in asexual populations. However, the extent to which these results are representative of natural populations, and of the response over timescales of greater than a few hundred generations, is unclear. Here we describe a new sediment-based proxy for the PIC:POC (particulate inorganic to particulate organic carbon ratio) of coccolithophore biomass, which is equivalent to the fractional energy contribution to calcification at constant pH, and a biologically meaningful measure of the organism’s tendency to calcify. Employing the geological record as a laboratory, we apply this proxy to sedimentary material from the southern Pacific Ocean to investigate the integrated response of real ancient coccolithophore populations to environmental change over many thousands of years. Our results provide a new perspective on phenotypic change in real populations of coccolithophorid algae over long timescales.",

            "abstract": "The mechanics of deep earthquakes have remained a puzzle for researchers since 1928 when they were first accurately identified by Kiyoo Wadati1 in Japan. Deep earthquakes show a split distribution, with peaks centered around ~370-420km and ~520-550km. As these events are limited to subducting slabs, it is accepted that they may be due to phase changes in metastable slab material. Indeed, conditions at ~350km depth are nominally appropriate for the olivine – wadsleyite transition, consistent with the anticrack mechanism previously observed in (Mg,Fe)2SiO42. The additional peak around 520km suggests that there is another siesmogenic phase change; candidates include Ca-garnet -> Ca-perovskite, wadsleyite -> ringwoodite and enstatite -> majorite or ilmenite. Importantly, for large scale seismogenesis to occur candidate phase changes must be susceptible to a runaway mechanism. Typically this involves the release of heat during exothermic reactions, which acts to increase reaction and nucleation rates. It is worth noting that the post-spinel reaction (sp -> pv + fp) marks the cessation of deep earthquakes; possibly as a result of being endothermic.\nThis research aims to identify which of these candidates could be responsible for seismogenesis.\nWe use high-pressure split cylinder multi-anvil experiments with acoustic emission detection. Low-pressure analogue materials have been used to allow greater cell sizes and thus sample volumes to enable accurate location of AE to within the sample. The candidate phase is annealed below its phase boundary, and then taken through the boundary by further compression. Acoustic emissions, if generated, are observed in real time and later processed to ensure they emanate from within the sample volume. Initial results indicate that the pryroxene -> ilmenite transition in MgGeO3 is seismogenic, with several orders of magnitude increase in the energy of AE concurrent with the phase boundary.\n",

            "abstract": "Formation and evolution of the solar system is studied in part using stable isotope ratios that are presumed to be primordial, or representative of conditions in the protosolar Nebula. Comets, meteorites and giant planet atmospheres provide measurements that can reasonably be presumed to represent primordial conditions while the terrestrial planets, Pluto and Saturn’s moon Titan have atmospheres that have evolved over the history of the solar system. The stable isotope ratios measured in these atmospheres are, therefore, first a valuable tool for evaluating the history of atmospheric escape and once escape is constrained can provide indications of conditions of formation. D/H ratios in the atmosphere of Venus provide indications of the amount of water lost from Venus over the history of the solar system, while several isotope ratios in the atmosphere of Mars provide evidence for long-term erosion of the atmosphere. We have recently demonstrated that the nitrogen ratios, 14N/15N, in Titan’s atmosphere cannot evolve significantly over the history of the solar system and that the primordial ratio for Titan must have been similar to the value recently measured for NH3 in comets. This implies that the building blocks for Titan formed in the protosolar nebula rather than in the warmer subnebula surrounding Saturn at the end of its formation. Our result strongly contrasts with works showing that 14N/15N in the atmosphere of Mars can easily fractionate from the terrestrial value to its current value due to escape processes within the lifetime of the solar system. The difference between how nitrogen fractionates in Mars and Titan’s atmospheres presents a puzzle for the fractionation of isotopes in an atmosphere due to atmospheric escape. Here, we present a method aiming at determining an upper limit to the amount of fractionation allowed to occur due to escape, which is a function of the escape flux and the column density of the atmospheric constituent. Through this approach, we demonstrate that fractionation on Titan is more limited than on Mars. When applied to Pluto, we find that any potential measurement of 14N/15N in Pluto’s atmosphere can constrain the type of escape occurring from Pluto’s atmosphere and possibly the source of nitrogen for Pluto.",

NOAA’s goals and mission areas cover a broad range of environmental data; a complexity exists in terms and vocabulary as applied to the creation of observing system derived products.\nThe NOSIA data collection focused first on decomposing NOAA’s goals in the creation and acceptance of Mission Service Areas (MSAs) by NOAA senior leadership. Products and services that supported the MSAs were then identified through the process of interviewing product producers across NOAA organization. Product Data inputs including models, databases and observing system were also identified. The NOSIA model contains over 20,000 nodes each representing levels in a network connecting products, datasources, users and desired outcomes. An immediate need became apparent that the complexity and variety of the data collected required data management to mature the quality and the content of the NOSIA model. The NOSIA Analysis Database (ADB) was developed initially to improve consistency of terms and data types to allow for the linkage of observing systems, products and NOAA’s Goals and mission. The ADB also allowed for the prototyping of reports and product generation in an easily accessible and comprehensive format for the first time.

Radon, a naturally-occurring, dissolved gas isotope found in surface water only in proximity to groundwater inputs, was measured along a 3 km reach of Squaw Creek and a 1 km reach of Martis Creek. A mass balance model of stream radon activity that considered only groundwater discharge as a radon source, and gas emanation as a radon sink was used to fit observed radon stream activities by varying groundwater discharge along the length of the streams. To quantify the gas emanation rate, we continuosly introduced a xenon tracer at a single station via submerged gas permeable silicon tubing and measured its concentration at 8 downstream locations. In Martis Creek,we used the smoothly decreasing Xe tracer profile to determine the gas transfer velocity for this 1-km reach. Radon also decreases, but at a rate less than predicted from gass loss. Radon mass balance requires groundwater influx of 3 m3/m/d upstream to 2 m3/m/d downstream along this reach. These estimates were in good agreement with observed increases in discharge measured using a hand-held flow meter.",

            "abstract": "Little is known about the cause of inland earthquakes, as such earthquakes have long recurrence cycles (from several hundred to several thousand years) that hamper our understanding of the processes that give rise to such events. However, these earthquakes can cause major disasters, primarily as their sources are closes to population centers. As such, understanding the mechanisms that cause inland earthquakes is an important step in the mitigation of disasters, and it requires knowledge of the mechanisms of strain accumulation and stress concentration along the source faults of such events.\nThe Nobi earthquake which occurred in 1891 was one of the largest inland earthquakes in Japan. The magnitude of the 1891 Nobi earthquake was 8. The magnitude is much larger than those of other inland earthquakes in Japan. To know cause of the Nobi earthquake and crustal structure of the area, the temporary seismic observation was conducted. We researched receiver function analysis to obtain seismic image around the 1891 Nobi earthquake area. The earthquakes which occurred from August, 2002 to March 10, 2011 are used. The seismic stations of Hi-net and temporary seismic network were used for the receiver function analysis.\nA clear image of the seismic structure was obtained in this area. The configuration of the subducting Philippine Sea slab is distorted at the western part of the Japan. The Philippine Pea plate is horizontally layered from Ise Bay to Wakasa Bay. In this area, a seismic experiment with artificial sources was done in November, 2012. We compared the results of the receiver function analysis and that of refraction analysis. The Philippine Sea slab is distorted up-ward at the area of the 1891 Nobi earthquake. The up-ward distorted Philippine Sea slab is in contact with the crust. The shallowest point of the subducting Philippine Sea slab is shallower than Moho boundaries at the both sides. The fault plane of the 1891 Nobi earthquake is located in parallel to the iso-depth lines of the horizontally layered Philippine Sea slab. The stress concentration might be caused by the structure, resulting in 1891 Nobi earthquake.",

            "abstract": "Sustainable management of water resources requires reliable estimates of actual evapotranspiration (ET) at fine spatial and temporal resolution. This is significant in the case of rice based irrigation systems, one of the major consumers of surface water resources and where ET forms a major component of water consumption. However huge tradeoff in the spatial and temporal resolution of satellite images coupled with lack of adequate number of cloud free images within a growing season act as major constraints in deriving ET at fine spatial and temporal resolution using remote sensing based energy balance models. The scale at which ET is determined is decided by the spatial and temporal scale of Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which form inputs to energy balance models. In this context, the current study employed disaggregation algorithms (NL-DisTrad and DisNDVI) to generate time series of LST and NDVI images at fine resolution. The disaggregation algorithms aimed at generating LST and NDVI at finer scale by integrating temporal information from concurrent coarse resolution data and spatial information from a single fine resolution image. The temporal frequency of the disaggregated images is further improved by employing composite images of NDVI and LST in the spatio-temporal disaggregation method. The study further employed half-hourly incoming surface insolation and outgoing long wave radiation obtained from the Indian geostationary satellite (Kalpana-1) to convert the instantaneous ET into daily ET and subsequently to the seasonal ET, thereby improving the accuracy of ET estimates. The estimates of ET were validated with field based water balance measurements carried out in Gadana, a subbasin predominated by rice paddy fields, located in Tamil Nadu, India.",

            "abstract": "Scientific study in deep boreholes has paid more attention as the demand of natural resources and waste disposal and risk evaluation of seismic hazard dramatically increases, such as petroleum exploitation, geothermal energy, carbon sequestration, nuclear waste disposal and seismogenic faulting. In the deep borehole geoengineering, knowledge of in-situ stress is essential for the design of drilling-casing plan. Understanding the relationship between fracture and in-situ stress is the key information to evaluate the potential of fracture seal/conduit and fracture reactivity. Also, assessment of in-situ stress can provide crucial information to investigate mechanism of earthquake faulting and stress variationfor earthquake cycles.\nFormations under the Coastal Plain in Taiwan have evaluated as saline-water formations with gently west-dipping and no distinct fractures endured by regional tectonics of arc-continental collision with N35W compression. The situation is characterized as a suitable place for carbon sequestration. In this study, we will integrate results from different in-situ stress determinations such as anelastic strain recovery (ASR), borehore breakout, hydraulic fracturing from a 3000m borehole of carbon sequestration testing site and further evaluate the seal feasibility and tectonic implication.\nResults of 30 ASR experiments between the depth of 1500m and 3000m showed the consistent normal faulting stress regime. Stress gradient of vertical stress, horizontal maximum stress and horizontal minimum stress with depth is estimated. Borehole breakout is not existed throughout 1500-3000m. The mean orientation of breakout is about 175deg and mean width of breakout is 84 deg. Based on rock mechanical data, maximum injection pressure of carbon sequestration can be evaulated. Furthermore, normal faulting stress regime is consistent with core observations and image logging, the horizontal maximum stress of 85deg inferred from breakout suggested that this place has been affected by the compression of oblique collision. The comparison of stress magnitudes estimated from ASR, breakout and hydraulic fracturing cab further verified current results.",

            "abstract": "In order to identify the spatial and temporal distributions of systematic forecast errors, a state-of-art Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) and 20-year reforecast (retrospective forecast or hindcast) have been used to investigate the statistical characteristics of forecast model and forecast uncertainties. GEFS is National Centers of Environmental Prediction (NCEP) daily operational forecast system since 1992. It was upgraded every other year. Latest GEFS (version 11.0.0) will be upgraded in early 2015 with new GFS (version 12.0.0) model, higher resolutions (T574L64 for 0-192 hours; T382L64 for 192-384 hours), 20 perturbed forecasts (plus one control forecast) and initiated every 6 hours. New GEFS is significantly improving forecast capability in terms of ensemble mean and probabilistic forecasts. There are three aspects in this study: 1). Ensemble forecasts could reduce systematic errors through an assimilation of model physics, i.e. stochastic perturbations and parameterizations, multi-model or multi-physics; 2). Enhanced ensemble forecasts could diagnostic model forecast errors in real time through forecast outliers from sequential ensemble forecasts (different lead-time) in terms of spatial and temporal variations to help forecasters to adjust their forecast guidance. Meanwhile, the information of forecast outliers could feedback to model developers to improve model parameterizations and reduce systematic errors; 3). Systematic forecast error could be partially removed through various statistical algorithms that will improve forecast reliability and accuracy for most forecast elements, such as precipitation, temperature, winds and et. al.",

            "abstract": "Process-based catchment water quality models are increasingly used as tools to inform land management. However, for such models to be reliable they need to be well calibrated and shown to reproduce key catchment processes. Calibration can be challenging for process-based models, which tend to be complex and highly parameterised. Calibrating a large number of parameters generally requires a large amount of monitoring data, but even in well-studied catchments, streams are often only sampled at a fortnightly or monthly frequency. The primary aim of this study was therefore to investigate how the quality and uncertainty of model simulations produced by one process-based catchment model, INCA-P (the INtegrated CAtchment model of Phosphorus dynamics), were improved by calibration to higher frequency water chemistry data. Two model calibrations were carried out for a small rural Scottish catchment: one using 18 months of daily total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) concentration data, another using a fortnightly dataset derived from the daily data. To aid comparability, calibrations were carried out automatically using the MCMC-DREAM algorithm.\nUsing daily rather than fortnightly data resulted in improved simulation of the magnitude of peak TDP concentrations, in turn resulting in improved model performance statistics. Marginal posteriors were better constrained by the higher frequency data, resulting in a large reduction in parameter-related uncertainty in simulated TDP (the 95% credible interval decreased from 26 to 6 μg/l). The number of parameters that could be reliably auto-calibrated was lower for the fortnightly data, leading to the recommendation that parameters should not be varied spatially for models such as INCA-P unless there is solid evidence that this is appropriate, or there is a real need to do so for the model to fulfil its purpose.\nSecondary study aims were to highlight the subjective elements involved in auto-calibration and suggest practical improvements that could make models such as INCA-P more suited to auto-calibration and uncertainty analyses. Two key improvements include model simplification, so that all model parameters can be included in an analysis of this kind, and better documenting of recommended ranges for each parameter, to help in choosing sensible priors.",

            "abstract": "Acquiring long records of past earthquakes on a large population of faults is a key step to understand how strain release along those fault systems varies spatially and temporally.In central Italy, NE-SW extension (~4 mm/yr) is accommodated on a wide normal fault system (50 x 100km). Benedetti et al. (2013) found that 7 of these faults, belonging to the Fucino fault system, have their seismic activity synchronized during short (less than 1 ka) paroxysmal phases of activity. 36Cl measurements and rare earth elements (REE) concentrations were used to reconstruct the seismic slip history of four major faults belonging to an adjacent 30-km-long fault system, the Aterno-Sulmona fault system, at the southeastward tip of the Paganica fault that ruptured during the 2009 L’Aquila earthquake.The preliminary results suggest that 3-7 seismic events have occurred on each fault over the last 11 ka (from NE to SW the Roccapreturo, the Castel di Ieri, the Roccacasale and the Pizzalto faults), with 50 cm to 2 m of associated slip per event. These events appear clustered within intense period of seismic activity lasting less than 1ka (2 to 4 seismic events) separated by 2 to 3 ka periods with no seismic events. The most recent recorded paroxysmal activity occurred about 2.5 ka ago with all four studied faults rupturing in more than 15 earthquakes over a period lasting less than 1ka. These results thus suggest that, as already observed on the Fucino fault system, the seismic activity of the Aterno-Sulmona fault system is also synchronized during short periods of paroxysmal seismic activity.When clustering periods are compared, the seismic activity of the Fucino and the Aterno-Sulmona fault system, are, however, apparently unsynchronized since the most recent clustering period for the Aterno-Sulmona system corresponds to a quiescent period for the Fucino fault system.",

Here, we argue that contemporary changes in the model of soil have several implications for the concept of ecosystem. Research findings demonstrate how the ecosystem like the soil, is far deeper than previously appreciated, is polygenetic in its development and evolution, and has become in the Anthropocene a human-natural body. Human forcings in particular have fundamentally transformed the science of soil and the ecosystem from a natural science to one that is basic and applied and more interdisciplinary, in need of active interaction with the social sciences, humanities, and the public at large. Remarkably, geoscientists have recently conceptualized an integrated system they call Earth’s Critical Zone, the human-natural system that includes solar energy, atmosphere, biota, soil, water, and the full weathering zone of the planet. We propose that the Earth’s Critical Zone is entirely compatible with Tansley’s and Lindeman’s concept of ecosystem [e.g., Tansley’s (1935) “the whole system (in the sense of physics)”], and encourage eco- and geo-scholars to get on with a needed reconciliation and hybridization of their biogeosciences.",

            "abstract": "Elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide stimulates plant productivity and ecosystem carbon gain but may also stimulate respiratory processes and thereby ecosystem carbon loss with the net balance being generally uncertain. In addition, climate driven warming and altered precipitation regimes under future climate also affects both uptake and release of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems making the net effect of climate change on ecosystem carbon budgets highly uncertain. In order to understand the response of these climate change driven changes, a large number of ecosystem experiments with single climate change factors have been conducted providing insight into the response of processes as well as ecosystems. However, ecosystems may respond in a complex and interactive way when all drivers of biological activity change in concert, which may not be well covered by past experiments nor reflected in existing Earth System Models causing potential over-prediction of future ecosystem carbon storage. It is therefore critical for future climate projections to understand better how changes in climate will interact with the effects of elevated CO2.\nIn a Danish climate change experiment, CLIMAITE, a shrubland ecosystem was exposed to all three main climate change factors, elevated CO2 and temperature and altered precipitation and the impacts on a range of ecosystem processes as well as the overall feedback to the atmosphere were studied and quantified. The measurements include direct measurements of carbon feedback from each experimental plot, which is almost never measured in elevated CO2 experiments for practical reasons. Our unique results show that long-term (seven years) simultaneous exposure to all climate change factors reduced the carbon storage of the shrubland ecosystem while in contrast, exposure to single factors individually led to either no change or increased carbon storage. This demonstrates significant interactions among climate change factors, especially when CO2 is involved leading to reduced sink strength in all combinations with elevated CO2 because ecosystem respiration was stimulated more than plant carbon uptake by photosynthesis. This may have major implications for ecosystem carbon feedback under future climate. Models seem not to reflect these interactions very well.",

            "abstract": "The foundations of the current theories for hydraulics and mechanics of unsaturated soils have been mainly based on the empirically introduced equations. There are various characteristics of unsaturated soils for which lots of different empirical equations have been proposed such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention curve, and effective stress parameter. One of the remarkable challenges which all current models face is hysteresis, i.e., for a certain matric suction, values of saturation, hydraulic conductivity and effective stress parameter in drying state and wetting are different. Conventional models of hydraulic and mechanical behaviour of unsaturated soils try to account for the hysteresis phenomenon by means of different empirical equations for each hydraulic path. Hassanizadeh and Gray (1993) claimed that the hysteresis in capillary pressure-saturation curves can be modelled through the inclusion of air-water interfaces as a new independent variable [1]. It has recently been stated that the same conjecture can be made for suction stress [2]. Therefore, it seems to better portray hydraulic and mechanical behaviour of unsaturated soils, interfaces are required as an indispensable part of the framework [3, 4]. This presentation aims at introducing the drawbacks of current theories of hydraulics and mechanics of unsaturated soils. For this purpose, the role of interfaces in the mechanics and hydraulics of unsaturated soils is explained and different possibilities to account for the contribution of interfaces are discussed. Finally, current challenges and future research directions are set forth.\n",

Taking Wen-rui Tang River as examples, this paper develops both multiple regressions (MR) model and artificial neural networks (ANN) model to estimate TN and TP concentration from high resolution IKONOS image data and in situ water samples collected concurrently with satellite overpass. By analyzing determination coefficients (R2) and relative root mean square error (RMSE), it is found that the measured and estimated values of both MR and ANN models are in good agreement (R2>0.85 and RMSE<2.50), and the estimated accuracy using ANN model is better (R2>0.86 and RMSE<0.89). The results also present the potential of high resolution IKONOS multispectral imagery to apply to urban rivers. The spatial distribution maps of TP and TN concentration generated by ANN model present apparent spatial variations and inform the decision makers of water quality variations in Wen-rui Tang River. The approach developed in this study proves to be effective and has the potential to be applied over urban rivers for water quality monitoring.",

            "abstract": "IODP Expedition 345 drilled the first holes in the lower plutonic crust at a fast-spreading ridge, recovering primitive layered gabbros [1]. Alteration occurred as: 1) a largely static pseudomorphic alteration, predominantly in the greenschist and sub-greenschist facies with mainly talc and serpentine replacing olivine, and prehnite replacing plagioclase. Talc sometimes overprints serpentine mesh texture. 2) an overprinting metasomatic alteration, spatially related to cataclastic fault zones and macroscopic veins, dominated by prehnite and chlorite. Secondary clinopyroxene and epidote locally overprint the prehnite-chlorite assemblage, but the last events are veins of prehnite and zeolite. Metamorphosed dykes show chilled margins within the cataclasites, and are themselves affected by cataclastic deformation. Faults, dykes and overprinting alteration are inferred to be related to the westward propagation of Cocos-Nazca spreading forming Hess Deep.\n87Sr/86Sr ratios of small whole rock samples of cataclasites and dyke rocks are in the range 0.7037 – 0.7048, indicating alteration by seawater at moderate integrated fluxes. The highest values were in cataclasites overprinted by prehnite. Sampling of individual minerals has been undertaken using a microscope mounted drill, and shows that alteration is mainly affecting secondary minerals, with late prehnite veins ranging up to 0.7054. δ18O values range from +1 to + 6 per mil. Combined with metamorphic data this indicates alteration at temperatures between 200 and 400 °C. Secondary clinopyroxene and talc replacing serpentine are interpreted to indicate transient prograde hydrothermal events. Preliminary modelling using Comsol Multiphysics suggests that the temperatures of the overprinting alteration, as well as transient prograde events, could be achieved in a permeable fault slot cutting through crust 0.5 to 1 m.y. old.\nThe prehnite-chlorite assemblage is predicted to be important in off-axis alteration, common in any location where faults intersect the Moho, including transform faults, near axis normal faults at slow spreading ridges, and perhaps bending faults at subduction zones.\n[1] Gillis, K.M., Snow J.

            "abstract": "Aerosol presents a large source of uncertainty in estimates of climate sensitivity. It is important to gauge model performance in simulating aerosol processes, and which aspects of aerosol-climate interaction contribute to uncertainty, to enable effort to be prioritized. Recent studies have shown that the total aerosol radiative forcing is dominated by aerosol-cloud interactions. Uncertainty in aerosol-cloud interactions is the largest uncertainty in the radiative forcing of climate, and estimates of the radiative forcing depend on several aspects of the climate that are currently not well modelled.\nWe show that there is a wide range of natural and anthropogenic aerosol loads across CMIP5 models. Even when models are driven with the same emissions there is large diversity in global sulphate load, and in its spatial distribution. Inter-model diversity in parameters that depend on aerosol is even greater: estimates of global mean cloud droplet radius, a metric for aerosol-cloud interactions, span over an order of magnitude.\nA simple model of aerosol-cloud interactions has been developed for a subset of CMIP5 models. This model is used to rank sources of inter-model diversity in estimates of magnitude of the cloud albedo effect. We show that different parameterisations of aerosol-cloud interactions are the main cause of inter-model diversity. Uncertainty in pre-industrial sulphate load also makes a substantial contribution, with smaller influences from inter-model differences in the change in sulphate load during the industrial era, and from differences in cloud fraction.",

Due to instrumental-specific limitations, information about the waves’ amplitudes is averaged individually in time and space; this leads to an underestimation of amplitudes depending on wavelengths and periods, respectively.\nGlobal TIMED-SABER temperature data from 2002 to 2013 are analysed with respect to gravity wave activity in the strato- and mesosphere as well as in the mesopause region. Depending on geographical position significant differences for the ascending and descending part of the orbit can be observed when gravity wave activity is averaged over one yaw cycle. Due to the specific orientation of the fields-of-view at polar latitudes the result might be explained by a preferred horizontal wave orientation.\nAnalyses of radiosondes released at ALOMAR, Northern Norway in late winter / early spring 2012 confirm a preferred orientation of wave fronts which is parallel to the mountain ridge. The analysis is repeated for Oberpfaffenhofen, Southern Germany in the vicinity of the Alps. The underestimation of amplitudes by SABER is quantified for both locations on a statistical base.\nFinally, gravity wave activity in the mesopause is derived from NDMC (Network for the Detection of Mesospheric Change) data including amongst others the stations at ALOMAR and Oberpfaffenhofen. The effects of the size and orientation of the different fields-of-view are discussed.\nConclusions how to make use of the different instrumental averaging effects in terms of gravity wave characterization – especially for polar latitudes – are drawn.",

It is shown that the most important characteristics of the dynamics of waves are the local Froude number Frm, calculated as the ratio of the maximum local velocity to the phase velocity of the waves, the minimum Richardson number Rimin and the effective Reynolds number Reeff , defined as the ratio the product of the phase velocity c of the waves and the wave amplitude a to the kinematic viscosity. Depending on the parameter values Frm and Rimin three main classes of ISW propagating in the pycnocline layer over or under homogeneous deep layer can be identified: (i) the weakly nonlinear waves at Rimin >1, Frm < 1; (ii) the stable strongly nonlinear waves with trapped cores at Rimin 0.15 and Frm ~1.2; and (iii) the unstable strongly nonlinear waves at Rimin <0.1 and Frm ~ 1.25. On the whole, the results of experiments and numerical simulations showed complete similarity in all range of the phase velocity and wavelength at large Reeff . The experimental and computed dependence of horizontal size of the trapped core on the height of the trapped core also demonstrate self-similarity of the trapped core shape. However, incomplete similarity of Rimin is found when dependence on viscosity remains at large Reeff which implies the viscosity effect on the stability of ISW. This dependence is approximated by power law Rimin~(a / h)-1.19 Reeff -1.19. With time a wave damping occurs, thus Rimin is growing following this self-similar dependence.",

            "abstract": "The space-borne Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) provides aerosol-cloud distributions and vertical profiles of aerosol total attenuated backscatter and depolarization ratio. With additional information (e.g., layer altitude, geographic location) the CALIOP vertical feature mask (VFM) has been used to assign aerosol types for observed aerosol features. This in turn has been used to assign lidar ratios for conversion of the assigned backscatter profiles to extinction profiles, most useful for verification of aerosol models. Here we show how the VFM also serves as a useful tool in and of itself for evaluating our recent aerosol reanalysis, called MERRAero. MERRAero is based on the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS-5) Earth system model, driven by meteorology from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA), and incorporates an aerosol module and assimilation of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) from observations made by the two Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments. In this study, we construct two VFMs using MERRAero aerosol distributions for comparison to CALIOP: a “direct” one where we emulate the CALIOP VFM by applying its algorithm directly to our simulated total attenuated backscatter and depolarization ratio profiles, and an “explicit” one where we map the simulated, compositionally resolved extinction profiles to the aerosol types in the CALIOP VFM. The “directly” calculated VFM hones in on errors in our assumed aerosol optical properties, while our “explicitly” calculated VFM helps uncover transport and composition errors in MERRAero. Additionally, by comparing our MERRAero VFMs to one another, we can identify shortcomings in the CALIOP VFM algorithm in instances where the aerosol types differ. We find that MERRAero dust depolarization ratios are biased low and need to be increased by 50% to match those observed by CALIOP. We also suggest that the CALIOP VFM algorithm be modified to require a minimum total attenuated backscatter for polluted dust, as the algorithm tends to flag polluted dust as the dominant aerosol type in regions with low aerosol loadings and a minimal contribution from dust relative to other aerosol types.",

Because of the sensitivity to temperature, annual-mean snowfall is expected to decrease in a warming climate except in very cold regions. However, it is shown here that CMIP5 models simulate smaller fractional changes in the intensities of daily snowfall extremes than in mean snowfall for many regions and months of the year. An asymptotic theory is introduced for snowfall extremes based on the temperature dependencies of the rain-snow transition and precipitation extremes. The theory accounts for the main features of the response of snowfall extremes to warming in the simulations. A variant of the theory that better accounts for the role of dynamics will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Even if Arctic is remote from industrialized areas, this region is influenced by elevated concentration of aerosols from mid-latitude, especially during winter. This is mainly due to the decrease of wet scavenging and the surface temperature inversion, both acting as a trap for the atmospheric particles. Aerosols play a key role on cloud’s microphysics, because they act as Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) or Ice Nuclei (IN). Both nuclei influence directly on cloud’s presence and formation, potentially impacting also thermodynamic phase transition through different mechanisms, which in turn affect cloud radiative properties and forcing.\nIn our study we used two sets of data: i) A combination of POLDER-3/PARASOL and MODIS/AQUA satellite measurements to retrieve cloud properties; ii) The numerical transport model FLEXPART which use carbon monoxide tracer to inform on concentration of biomass burning and anthropogenic aerosols. The main advantage of combining these two sets of data is to obtain large statistics about clouds that have been potentially influenced by varied concentrations of aerosol.\nWe report here results of a study in which we analyze potential interaction between clouds and aerosols from biomass burning and anthropogenic sources. We first analyzed the temperature at which thermodynamic phase transition is most likely to occur according to the types and concentrations of aerosols. It is shown a correlation between the temperature of thermodynamic phase transition and aerosols concentrations and type. Unlike we could have expected from previous studies, preliminary analyses suggest that aerosols from anthropogenic sources accelerate the liquid-ice transition whereas aerosols from biomass burning inhibit the transition from water to ice. Different hypotheses can be responsible for this observation and we analyze parameters that can play a role on the transition temperature shift and how aerosols act as an inhibitor or activator of the phase transition, for example their impact on the effective radius. Moreover in this study we add data from ECMF, which give information on atmospheric state. So we can constrain our results on different parameters as the specific humidity or the vertical velocity, which enable to be ride of a bias from atmospheric parameters and ensure the aerosol-nature impact.",

The data consist of thirteen flowline parallel lines across the ridge and they show that the accretion across the ridge has not been symmetric. Using Magellan, a new tool to model magnetic anomalies, we obtain a tectonic evolution of the area for the past 6 Ma. The area just south of the BTF (at 0-20 km distance) is characterized by a very large asymmetry in the magnetic data. This asymmetry is most clearly seen within the Brunhes anomaly, which has a big divide in it. Our model suggests that the ridge has shifted twice some 8-12 km to the east within the past 2 Ma resulting from two very rapid rift propagations. We could not determine whether the propagations were to the south or north because of very rapid propagation rates. The tectonic evolution of the area 20-90 km south of the BTF is simpler and the model is more readily understood. The model suggests that a few short lived propagators cause asymmetry in the area. They all, but one, propagate north toward the BTF and all, but one, transfer lithosphere from the Eurasian plate to the North-American plate. Unlike the prominent far reaching (> 100km) propagators just south of Iceland these propagators are short. They play an important role in the tectonic evolution of the ridge and our results suggest that the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in this area is very dynamic.",

UAV imagery acquired in October 2009 was processed using a structure-from-motion and multi-view stereo (SfM-MVS) approach in PhotoScan software. Identification of ~200 ground control points throughout the image set was facilitated by automated image matching in SfM_georef software[1] and the data incorporated into PhotoScan for network optimisation and georeferencing. The completed 2009 model enabled an ~5 cm spatial resolution orthoimage to be generated with an expected accuracy (based on residuals on control) of ~0.3 m. This was supported by comparison to a previously created 2008 model, which gave standard deviations on tie points (located on stationary terrain) of 0.27 m and 0.43 m in Easting and Northing respectively.\nThe high resolution of the orthoimage allowed an investigation into surface displacements and geomorphology of surface features (compared to the 2008 model). The results have produced a comprehensive surface displacement map of the Super-Sauze earthflow, as well as highlighting interesting variations in fissure geomorphology and density between the 2008 and 2009 models. This study underscored the capability for UAV imagery and SfM-MVS to generate highly detailed orthographic imagery and DEMs with a low cost approach that offers significant potential for landslide hazard assessments.\n[1] http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/jamesm/software/sfm_georef.htm",

            "abstract": "The Moon represents an enabling Solar System exploration asset because of its proximity, resources, and size. Its location has facilitated robotic missions from 5 different space agencies this century. The proximity of the Moon has stimulated commercial space activity, which is critical for sustainable space exploration. Since 2000, a new view of the Moon is coming into focus, which is very different from that of the 20th century. The documented presence of volatiles on the lunar surface, coupled with mature ilmenite-rich regolith locations, represent known resources that could be used for life support on the lunar surface for extended human stays, as well as fuel for robotic and human exploration deeper into the Solar System. The Moon also represents a natural laboratory to explore the terrestrial planets and Solar System processes. For example, it is an end-member in terrestrial planetary body differentiation. Ever since the return of the first lunar samples by Apollo 11, the magma ocean concept was developed and has been applied to both Earth and Mars. Because of the small size of the Moon, planetary differentiation was halted at an early (primary?) stage. However, we still know very little about the lunar interior, despite the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments, and to understand the structure of the Moon will require establishing a global lunar geophysical network, something Apollo did not achieve. Also, constraining the impact chronology of the Moon allows the surfaces of other terrestrial planets to be dated and the cratering history of the inner Solar System to be constrained. The Moon also represents a natural laboratory to study space weathering of airless bodies. It is apparent, then, that human and robotic missions to the Moon will enable both science and exploration. For example, the next step in resource exploration is prospecting on the surface those deposits identified from orbit to understand the yield that can be expected. Such prospecting will also address important science questions by determining the form of lunar surface volatiles. Science missions to examine the lunar interior and space weathering will also inform exploration systems with regard to the locations of large moonquakes and the radiation environment. Such examples highlight the Moon as an enabling Solar System science and exploration asset.",

EOF [Kutzbach 1967 J. App. Met], SVD [Bretherton et al 1992, J. Clim] and EMD [Huang et al 1998, Proc. Roy Soc] methods are used to separate and identify different physical processes and mechanisms. The dominant fluctuation at the mooring is shown to be seasonal, caused (1) by seasonal surface fluxes and local Ekman pumping (on the f-plane) by the wind stress curl, (2) by eddies emanated west of the Luzon Strait spun up by wind stress curl west of Luzon, and (3) by Rossby waves due to Kuroshio path fluctuations in the Strait. Meso-scale eddies are embedded in the seasonal variation and they are shown to be locally generated by baroclinic instability and penetrate through the entire depth of the mooring.",

            "abstract": "Episodic tremor and slip (ETS) is a stick-slip in the transition zone between locked and stable sliding zones on the plate interface in Southwest Japan and Cascadia. ETS episode with duration of several days usually recurs at interval of several months at each segment. On the other hand, in the Bungo channel region where is the western edge of the ETS zone in SW Japan, tremor activity continued for several months during the long-term slow slip event (SSE) in 2003 and 2010. In this paper, the relationship between long-term SSE and surrounded triggered tremor is discussed.\nTremor triggered by the long-term SSE is spatially localized in the narrow width of about 10 km at the shallowest part of the tremor zone, and at the neighboring area just downdip from the source fault of the SSE. The frequency distribution of tremor along the dip direction during the SSE period is consistent with the spatial distribution of total slip estimated for 2010 SSE. Therefore, the slip of the long-term SSE penetrated in the ETS zone may generate tremor. The daily number of the activated tremor is 12-14 during the SSE; however, it is 40-50 for regular ETS episode during the inter-SSE period. On the other hand, slip rates of the long-term SSE and ETS are typically 1 mm/d and 3 mm/d, respectively. Therefore, tremor rate may be controlled by slip rate.\nAfter SSEs in 2003 and 2010, tremor activity seems to slightly increase in the east region within 50 km from the triggered tremor area. Such 7-year period variation in tremor activity is observed in only the shallower side of the tremor zone. Moreover, pattern of the long-term variation seems to slightly migrate to east during a few years. We interpret that a tiny transient slip after the long-term SSE slowly propagates between transition and locked zones.\nTremor activity at the shallowest part of the tremor zone in the Bungo channel continued longer than that of regular ETS in the late 2006 during the inter-SSE period. Associated tiny GPS change may suggest a minor long-term SSE. Similar tremor activity with duration longer than a few months has been observed from May 2014. However, no GPS change so far may suggest the occurrence of a very tiny SSE near the tremor zone.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost regions play a key role in global carbon budgets because of the size and vulnerability of their soil organic carbon (SOC) stock. Climate change is expected to raise soil temperatures resulting in an increased soil organic matter (SOM) source available for decomposition. Mineralized in the form of greenhouse gasses (GHG), this carbon can cause a positive feedback for further climate change.\nThermokarst lake formation show a cyclic behaviour starting with ice melt, lowering of the permafrost table, ground surface subsidence, the formation of wetlands and eventually thermokarst lakes. In time, these lakes often drain either by proceeding permafrost degradation and talik formation, or by being cut into by another water body or drainage channel.\nThe potential decomposition (quality) of SOM is of great importance to predict potential GHG release from permafrost regions and model global climate scenarios. Thermokarst development is often considered an important factor in permafrost degradation and increasing availability of SOM for decomposition.\nHowever, the influence of past thermokarst events and thus episodes of increased decomposition, is less understood. What is the difference in SOM between sites that have undergone former thermokarst cycles and sites that have not? Will there be a different response in decomposition upon climate change for these different land surface types?\nTwo Siberian field sites, Spasskaya Pad (boreal forest) and Kytalyk (tundra), both with extensive active and relict thermokarst features, have been sampled. Simple geochemical characteristics that might be indicative of potential decomposition have been determined for all groups and will be compared. A comparison of results from permafrost affected and intact areas are presented and discussed.",

            "abstract": "Projected global change will increase the level of land use and environmental stressors such as drought and grazing in the near future, particularly in drylands. Still, combined effects of drought and grazing on plant production are poorly understood, thus hampering establishment of adequate projections and mitigation strategies.\nWe used a large, cross-continental database on long-term studies from drylands to quantify ecosystem responses to drought and grazing with the ultimate goal to increase functional understanding of these responses. Two key aspects of ecosystem stability, resistance to and recovery after a drought, were evaluated based on standardized and normalized aboveground net primary production (ANPP) data. Drought events and intensities were classified via the standardized precipitation index (SPI). We tested effects of drought intensity (SPI class), grazing regime (grazed, ungrazed), biome (grassland, shrubland, savanna) or dominant life history of the herbaceous layer (annual, perennial) to assess the relative importance of these factors for ecosystem stability, and to identify predictable relationships between drought intensity and ecosystem resistance and recovery. We found that ecosystem stability was better explained by dominant life history of the herbaceous layer than by biome. Increasing drought intensity (quasi-) linearly reduced ecosystem resistance. Even though annual and perennial systems had a similar response rate to increasing drought intensity, they differed in their general magnitude of resistance, with annual systems being ca. 27% less resistant. Vice versa, systems with an herbaceous layer dominated by annuals had substantially higher post-drought recovery, particularly when grazed. Combined effects of drought and grazing were not merely additive but modulated by dominant life history of the herbaceous layer.\nOur study established predictable relationships between drought intensity and drought-related relative losses in ANPP, and suggest that systems with an herbaceous layer dominated by annuals are more prone to ecosystems degradation under future global change regimes.",

            "abstract": "The ionospheric conductivity distribution is essential for understanding the coupling in the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere (MIT) system. Hall conductivities, which regulate ionospheric current flow in the direction perpendicular to both the background magnetic field and the electric field, exert control over magnetospheric configuration, including transport within the plasmasphere and reconnection in the magnetotail [Lotko et al., 2014]. Pedersen conductivities control electric field variability and, in turn, determine the distribution and intensity of Joule heating, a prominent source of upper atmospheric temperature and neutral density enhancement.\nContemporary conductivity modeling techniques rely on limiting assumptions and are 2-dimensional by design. Typically these models assume Maxwellian incoming particle energy distributions and simplistic current closure paths within an ionospheric ‘shell’ located at 110 km. We have developed a method to: 1) eliminate these assumptions and 2) allow 3-dimensional conductivity analysis using particle energy spectra provided by Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites. A sequential non-linear procedure then regresses the conductivities derived from DMSP data on the same basis functions used in the Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynamics (AMIE) procedure to obtain a realistic form of the covariance model, with the goal to integrate 3-dimensional conductivity analysis into the AMIE procedure. This addresses one of the primary sources of uncertainty within AMIE, and will ultimately allow more accurate characterization of high-latitude ionospheric electrodynamics. We present 3-dimensional conductivity distributions derived from satellite observations and global maps of these conductivities for the year 2010.\n\n",

            "abstract": "The complex interactions and feedbacks between humans and water are very essential issues but are poorly understood in the newly proposed discipline of socio-hydrology (Sivapalan et al., 2012). An exploratory model with the appropriate level of simplification can be valuable to improve our understanding of the co-evolution and self-organization of socio-hydrological systems driven by interactions and feedbacks operating at different scales. In this study, a simple coupled modeling framework for socio-hydrology co-evolution is developed for the Tarim River Basin in Western China, and is used to illustrate the explanatory power of such a model. The study area is the mainstream of the Tarim River, which is divided into two modeling units. The socio-hydrological system is composed of four parts, i.e., social sub-system, economic sub-system, ecological sub-system, and hydrological sub-system. In each modeling unit, four coupled ordinary differential equations are used to simulate the dynamics of the social sub-system represented by human population, the economic sub-system represented by irrigated crop area, the ecological sub-system represented by natural vegetation cover and the hydrological sub-system represented by stream discharge. The coupling and feedback processes of the four dominant sub-systems (and correspondingly four state variables) are integrated into several internal system characteristics interactively and jointly determined by themselves and by other coupled systems. For example, the stream discharge is coupled to the irrigated crop area by the colonization rate and mortality rate of the irrigated crop area in the upper reach and the irrigated area is coupled to stream discharge through irrigation water consumption. The co-evolution of the Tarim socio-hydrological system is then analyzed within this modeling framework to gain insights into the overall system dynamics and its sensitivity to the external drivers and internal system variables. In the modeling framework, the state of each subsystem is holistically described by one state variable and the framework is flexible enough to comprise more processes and constitutive relationships if they are needed to illustrate the interaction and feedback mechanisms of the human-water system.",

            "abstract": "Wildfires can negatively affect watershed functions by altering forest ecosystem structure, soil properties, flow pathways, evapotranspiration rates, and particulate matter emission and deposition. The recent Wildfire Cohesive Strategies recommends fuel treatments as a forest management tool to reduce the occurrence and likely impacts of catastrophic fires in populated areas. However, little is known about how these treatments affect watershed peakflows and water yield in different physiographic regions in the continuous United States (CONUS). There is an immediate need to identify high priority watersheds for integrated management. We hypothesize that water yield responses to wildfires vary by regions due to differences in climate, watershed characteristics, and magnitude of fire disturbance regimes. The monthly WaSSI water balance model was applied to 88,000 HUC-12 watersheds in the CONUS and results were scaled to 18 Water Resource Region (WRR) to examine the sensitivity of hydrologic response to changes in vegetation structure (leaf area index) and soil porosity. We found that, by WRR, a reduction of LAI by 50% can have substantial (>17-93 mm/yr, or 7-21%) influence on water yield in wet regions (annual precipitation > 800 mm) and smaller impacts on water yield in terms of absolute values (3-32 mm/yr) in drier regions (annual precipitation 300-800 mm). However, the relative change in the drier region can be equally large (10-20%). In contrast, water yield in the dry regions is more responsive to soil disturbances than in the wet regions. Water yield was estimated to increase by 9-24 mm/yr or 1-14% if soil infiltration capacity (as simulated by soil field capacity) was reduced by half. In the drier regions, the increase in water yield would be 3-24 mm/yr or 5-40% as a result of soil disturbance. Reduction of both LAI and soil field capacity by half could elevate water yield by 50% at the WRR scale, although larger changes in water yield may occur at smaller scales in individual HUC12 watersheds. Additional research is needed to assess fire effects on surface energy balances and potential evapotranspiration (PET). Also, realistic scenarios should be developed to represent the true effects of fires on vegetation and soil parameters at the watershed scale.",

The ROSINA instrument suite consisting of a double focusing mass spectrometer, a time of flight mass spectrometer and a pressure sensor, will provide temporally and spatially resolved data on the comet’s volatile inventory.\nThe effect of spacecraft outgassing is well known and has been measured with the ROSINA instruments onboard Rosetta throughout the cruise phase. The flux of released neutral gas originating from the spacecraft cannot be distinguished from the cometary signal by the mass spectrometers and varies significantly with solar illumination conditions. For accurate interpretation of the instrument data, a good understanding of spacecraft outgassing is necessary. In this talk we present results simulating the spacecraft environment with the Adaptive Mesh Particle Simulator (AMPS) code. AMPS is a direct simulation monte carlo code that includes multiple species in a 3D adaptive mesh to describe a full scale model of the spacecraft environment. We use the triangulated surface model of the spacecraft to implement realistic outgassing rates for different areas on the surface and take shadowing effects in consideration. The resulting particle fluxes are compared to the measurements of the ROSINA experiment and implications for ROSINA measurements and data analysis are discussed. Spacecraft outgassing has implications for future space missions to rarefied atmospheres as it imposes a limit on the detection of various species.",

            "abstract": "Agriculture in the 21st Century faces significant challenges due to increases in the demand for agricultural products from a global population expected to reach 9.5 billion by 2050, changes in land use that are reducing the area of arable land worldwide, and the uncertainties associated with increasing climate variability and change. There is broad agreement that meeting these challenges will require significant changes in agro-ecosystem management at the landscape scale. In 2012, the USDA/ARS announced the reorganization of 10 existing benchmark watersheds, experimental ranges, and research farms into a Long-Term Agro-ecosystem Research (LTAR) network. Earlier this year, the LTAR network expanded to 18 sites, including 3 led by land grant universities and/or private foundations. The central question addressed by the LTAR network is, “How do we sustain or enhance productivity, profitability, and ecosystem services in agro-ecosystems and agricultural landscapes”? All 18 LTAR sites possess rich historical databases that extend up to 100 years into the past. However as LTAR moves forward, the focus is on collecting a core set of common measurements over the next 30-50 years that can be used to draw inferences regarding the nature of agricultural sustainability and how it varies across regional and continental-scale gradients. As such, LTAR is part long-term research network and part observatory network. Rather than focusing on a single site, each LTAR has developed regional partnerships that allow it to address agro-ecosystem function in the large basins and eco-climatic zones that underpin regional food production systems. Partners include other long-term in-situ data networks (e.g., Ameriflux, CZO, GRACEnet, LTER, NEON). ‘Next steps’ include designing and implementing a cross-site experiment addressing LTAR’s central question.",

            "abstract": "Predicting the spatio-temporal dynamics of global peatlands is key to understanding their role under past and future climate change. However, our understanding of peatlands in the Earth System is limited and global modelling studies mostly rely on temporally fixed, prescribed maps of peatland extent, thereby neglecting changes in peatland coverage with climate as evidenced by paleoclimatic proxy information. For global-scale predictions of peatland extent and lateral dynamics, we combine criteria for (i) the ecosystem water balance, (ii) simulated peatland carbon (C) balance conditions, and (iii) the simulated inundation persistency. The latter is based on subgrid-scale topography information and the simulated soil water balance. This model is successful at capturing the spatial distribution and extent of major boreal and tropical peatland complexes and reveals the governing limitations to peatland occurrence across the globe. Peatlands covering large boreal lowlands are reproduced only when accounting for a positive feedback induced by the enhanced mean soil water holding capacity in peatland-dominated regions. Much of our understanding of the role of peatlands in the carbon cycle rests on measured basal dates and C accumulation rates of peat cores from of today's existing peatlands. This data suggest a C sink that has persisted since peat initiation. However, these sink estimates do not include carbon release from peatlands that have disappeared over the past thousands of years. We present results from an application of our model to varying climate boundary conditions as simulated for the transition from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the present-day. This reveals the spatial dynamics of peatlands in response to climatic shifts, ice sheet retreat, and sea level rise. In line with maps of pollen records of sphagnum cores, a northward shift of peatlands is simulated over the past 20,000 years. A large expansion of the total peatland area is simulated for the Eurasian continent. In South-East Asia, tropical peatlands, wide-spread at the LGM, are simulated to have been submerged by rising sea levels. Our results suggest that C stored in peatlands was around present-day levels at the LGM, dropped during the Deglaciation and accumulated gradually under stable climatic conditions during the Holocene.",

An increased understanding of the mechanics of this process is imperative in determining the dynamics of marine ice sheets and consequently predicting their future extent and thickness.\nAlley et al. (2008) proposed an empirically derived calving law, relating the calving rate to the strain rate at the calving front. However, Hindmarsh (2012) showed that a similar relationship could be deduced by considering the viscous flow of the ice shelf. We investigate the relationship between the ice shelf flow field and the strain rate field in the area close to the calving front. Analysis is undertaken of ice surface velocity data for a range of large Antarctic ice shelves (data from Rignot et al., 2011) and an inferred strain rate field produced from that data. These geophysical results are compared with a series of simple mathematical models from which thickness profiles and velocity fields can be obtained for a range of geometries and flow regimes.\nFluid mechanical laboratory experiments simulating the flow of an ice shelf in an idealized channel geometry provide a further comparison to the theoretical models and geophysical data, and allow a wider range of parameters to be tested. We show some results from these laboratory experiments aimed at exploring the success of the mathematical models.",

            "abstract": "Iceberg calving at large, marine-terminating glaciers has been shown to be seismogenic. Seismic energy from these events is released slowly, resulting in characteristic low-frequency signals. The events therefore typically escape detection by traditional systematic methods. Here we show the results of a detection algorithm applied to data observed at two stations, both ~100 km from Helheim Glacier, South East Greenland, in 2007 and 2008 for the purpose of detecting calving-related seismic signals. The detector entails sliding a 150 s wide window over the observed vertical displacement seismograms at steps of one second. Relative power in the 1.1-3.3 s band is monitored, and the detector is activated when a pre-defined threshold is exceeded. We determine the threshold by calibrating the detector with a record of known events observed by time lapse cameras at Helheim Glacier and automatic detections of glacial earthquakes from the GSN (Global Seismic Network) stations. The resulting list of detections is then filtered for events overlapping with tectonic events, both local and global. We observe a clear periodicity in the detections, with most events occurring during the late summer and early fall, roughly coinciding with the end of the melt season. This apparent offset from peak melt intensity leads us to speculate that the pattern in calving is the result of a combination of the seasonal development of multiple physical properties of the glacier, i.e., surface crevassing, subglacial melt and crevassing, and the subglacial drainage system.",

            "abstract": "A pronounced decadal change of tropical cyclone (TC) activity was identified over western North Pacific (WNP) around late-1990s. After late-1990s, the WNP total TC genesis number exhibited an evident decrease, particularly over southern WNP region (S-WNP: 5oN-20oN), which was mainly caused by reduced vorticity and descending anomalies. We also detected a significant northward migration of TC genesis from 17.2°N to 18.7°N. The above TC genesis change is attributed to the weakening of monsoon trough and local Hadley cell that is associated with sea surface temperature climate shift around the late-1990s. In terms of three prevailing TC tracks changes, the northwestward-moving track (II) became the most dominant prevailing track mode while the westward-moving track (I) became weaker, and the northeastward-recurving track (III) had a westward shift. The track shifts primarily resulted from the large-scale steering flows change, which also had played a vital role in the modulation of TC regional duration. Thus, the subtropical East Asia tended to have a higher risk of encountering TC while the Southern China had a lower risk. Additionally, a visual reduction was seen in both number and proportion of typhoons reaching categories 1 and 2, and a remarkable poleward migration was also recognized in the average latitudes where TCs have achieved their lifetime-maximum intensity.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric aerosols and carbon dioxide (CO2), as two key factors driving the global climate change, have earned enormous attention from scientist around the world. One challenge for the satellite measurements of CO2 using this SWIR wavelength range (~1.6μm) is the impact of multiple scattering by aerosols and cirrus. Since the rapid economic growth and associated increase in fossil fuel consumption have caused serious particulate pollution in many regions of China, remote sensing of CO2 using SWIR band in China needs to pay more attention to the scattering properties of aerosol particles and the multiple scattering. Considering the complexity of morphological and chemical properties, aerosol particles are grouped based on a large number of TEM/SEM images, and then their scattering properties at 1.6μm band are calculated by the T-matrix method and GMM method. In this study, the Monte Carlo method is used to solve the multiple scattering problem by simulating photons transport in the scattering media. We combined this multiple scattering model with the LBLRTM as a forward radiative transfer model for studying the impact of aerosol scattering on the satellite observations of CO2 using SWIR band. Finally, based on the GOCART aerosol component products, AERONET aerosol size distribution products, CALIPSO aerosol profile products, and MODIS aerosol optical depth and surface albedo products, the monthly variability of errors in CO2 concentrations over China were calculated and analyzed. The results indicate that CO2 concentrations are overestimated in western regions of China, especially in desert areas (a maximum of ~7.08%), and those are underestimated in eastern regions (a minimum of ~-6.9%).",

            "abstract": "Normal mode calculation of a semi-closed or completely closed bay or ocean basin helps us to understand the oscillation characteristics including those excited by incoming tsunamis. In addition, tsunami propagation can be synthesized by superposition of normal modes.\nJapan Sea is an almost closed ocean basin where many large tsunamigenic earthquakes occurred (fig. 1). Satake and Shimazaki (1988) calculated the normal modes using a 20km grid (~10’ or about 2,000 ocean grids), compared the observed and calculated normal modes from the 1964 Niigata and 1983 Japan Sea earthquakes, and discussed the their different excitation characteristics . Because of development of computer and numerical computation techniques, it is worthwhile to revisit this problem.\nStarting from Laplace’s tidal equations and ignoring the rotation of the earth, Loomis (1975) discretized the problem into the eigenvalue problem of a symmetric sparse matrix, which was solved by Householder transformations. This method is used by Satake and Shimazaki (1988) for Japan Sea and Aida (1996) for Tokyo Bay. However, this method needs O(n^3) operation in time and O(n^2) in memory (n is the total number of water grid. e.g., for Japan Sea in 30 sec grid, n~10^6), which would require a super computer.\nTo overcome this disadvantage, we first introduce a recent iteration method called Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi Method (Lehoucq et al., 1997), which itself speeds up the calculation a bit. Then after we develop a sparse version of matrix storage and multiplication, the operation count in time and memory reduced dramatically to O(n^1.5) (including about 0.5 for iteration process) and O(n) respectively, utilizing the special property of the matrix and the iteration method. This means any current computer can easily solve a large eigenvalue problem.\nEarthquakes.png",

            "abstract": "Mixed tropical forest structure is highly heterogeneous unlike plantation or mixed temperate forest structure, and therefore, different sampling approaches are required. However, the appropriate sampling design for estimating the above-ground biomass (AGB) in Bruneian lowland mixed dipterocarp forest (MDF) has not yet been fully clarified. The aim of this study was to provide supportive information in sampling design for Bruneian forest carbon inventory. The study site was located at Kuala Belalong lowland MDF, which is part of the Ulu Tembulong National Park, Brunei Darussalam. Six 60 m × 60 m quadrats were established, separated by a distance of approximately 100 m and each was subdivided into quadrats of 10 m × 10 m, at an elevation between 200 and 300 m above sea level. At each plot all free-standing trees with diameter at breast height (dbh) ≥ 1 cm were measured. The AGB for all trees with dbh ≥ 10 cm was estimated by allometric models. In order to analyze changes in the diameter-dependent parameters used for estimating the AGB, different quadrat areas, ranging from 10 m × 10 m to 60 m × 60 m, were used across the study area, starting at the South-West end and moving towards the North-East end. The derived result was as follows: (a) Big trees (dbh ≥ 70 cm) with sparse distribution have remarkable contribution to the total AGB in Bruneian lowland MDF, and therefore, special consideration is required when estimating the AGB of big trees. Stem number of trees with dbh ≥ 70 cm comprised only 2.7% of all trees with dbh ≥ 10 cm, but 38.5% of the total AGB. (b) For estimating the AGB of big trees at the given acceptable limit of precision (p), it is more efficient to use large quadrats than to use small quadrats, because the total sampling area decreases with the former. Our result showed that 239 20 m × 20 m quadrats (9.6 ha in total) were required, while 15 60 m × 60 m quadrats (5.4 ha in total) were required when estimating the AGB of the trees with dbh ≥ 70 cm at 10% p. (c) In order to decrease the measurement time, it is necessary to use nested quadrats containing smaller sub-quadrats. Also, it was found that when 15 60 m × 60 m quadrats for trees with dbh ≥ 70 cm, and 20 m × 20 m sub-quadrats for trees with dbh of 10.0-19.9 cm were used, AGB could be estimated below 10% p for both dbh classes.",

The inner moraine has exposure ages ranging from 18.0±1.7 to 30.6±2.8 ka (n=10), with a mean age of 23.8±4.0 ka, corresponding to the global Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The outer moraine yields exposure ages ranging from 18.0±1.6 to 39.9±3.7 ka (n=5). Evidence for weathering leads us to view the oldest age as a minimum age, placing moraine formation during MIS3. Chronologies from the last glacial period from south slope of the Nyainqentanglha support this interpretation. Thus, there appears to have been a local LGM (LLGM) during MIS3 and a more limited glacial advance during the global LGM. Glacial advances during MIS3 in the Nyainqentanglha may correlate with millennial-scale climate change (Heinrich events)",

            "abstract": "Climate change has important implications for public health. We developed and tested the hypothesis that conditions for dengue fever transmission in San Juan (Puerto Rico, USA) are becoming favorable as a result of meteorological drivers being modified with climate change. Sea level pressure, mean sea level (MSL), wind, sea surface temperature (SST), air surface temperature (AST), rainfall, and confirmed dengue cases were variables examined over the past 30 years, or longer for some variables. Statistical tools used included Principal Component Analysis, Pearson correlation coefficient, Mann-Kendall trend tests, and logistic regressions. Results show that dry days are increasing and that wet days are decreasing. MSL is steadily increasing, which increases the risk of dengue cases along the coast, as the perimeter of the San Juan Bay estuary expands and the shoreline moves inland. Warming is evident in both SST and AST. Maximum and minimum air surface temperature extremes have also increased. Incidence of dengue is accelerating along with environmental change. For example, between 2000-2011, dengue transmission increased by a factor of 3.4 (95% CI: 1.9-6.1) for each 1ºC increase in SST. Between 2007 and 2011, this risk factor increased to 5.2 (95% CI: 1.9-13.9) for every 1ºC increase in SST. An important but difficult to examine problem is how social and economic factors affect such dengue fever transmission rates in light of environmental change. A concern is that the patterns observed in San Juan are representative of potential incidence of dengue virus in other parts of the island of Puerto Rico and in other Caribbean nations. These results help understand patterns of disease spreading, and allow public health officials to evaluate scenarios and interventions intended to mitigate the impacts of climate change.",

            "abstract": "The rheology is a key influencing factor in mantle convection as it is directly responsible for the convective vigor, therefore altering heat transport and the distribution of stresses. Deformation in terrestrial mantles is mainly accommodated by two mechanisms: diffusion and dislocation creep. While the former probably plays a dominant role at high pressures, the latter is thought to be important at relatively low pressures, as inferred by seismic anisotropy in the Earth’s upper mantle [1].\nDislocation creep is more challenging to handle than diffusion creep as the viscosity becomes strain-rate dependent, introducing a non-linearity that requires more computational resources. Thus, to avoid this additional complexity, a Newtonian rheology (i.e. diffusion creep) with reduced activation parameters is often used to mimic non-Newtonian behavior [2], causing misleading results if applied to certain scenarios.\nWe run thermal evolution models in 2D cylindrical geometry using the mantle convection code Gaia [3] for Mercury, the Moon and Mars. It has been argued that their mantles deform by pure dislocation creep but our simulations show that, when using a mixed rheology that accounts for both diffusion and dislocation creep, deformation in the mantles of Mercury, Moon and Mars is dominated by diffusion creep, while dislocation creep only occurs in small confined regions. Further, our results show a transition from a diffusion creep to a dislocation creep dominated mantle as the Rayleigh number increases and indicate that systems even with relatively high effective Rayleigh numbers (up to 5 x 107) are dominated by diffusion creep. Terrestrial bodies like Mercury, the Moon or Mars can thus be correctly modeled using a Newtonian rheology. This may change for bodies like the Earth or Venus since the effective Rayleigh numbers are higher and thus either a mixture of both diffusion and dislocation or purely dislocation creep would define the deformation mechanism. Moreover, dislocation creep-dominated regions are significant at the beginning of the thermal evolution when the mantle is hot and thus the system characterized by vigorous convection. As the mantle cools with time, diffusion creep tends to take over.\n[1] J. van Hunen et al., EPSL, 2005; [2] U. Christensen, Geophys. J. R. astr. Soc., 1984; [3] C. Hüttig et al., PEPI, 2013.",

            "abstract": "Estimates of N2O emissions in Canada indicate that 17% of all agriculture-based emissions are associated with the decomposition of crop residues. However, research specific to the western Canadian prairies (including Saskatchewan) has shown that the N2O emission factor for N sources in this region typically ranges between 0.2 and 0.6%, which is well below the current IPCC default emission factor of 1.0%. Thus, it stands to reason that emissions from crop residues should also be lower than those calculated using the current IPCC emission factor. Current data indicates that residue decomposition, N mineralization and N2O production are affected by a number of factors such as C:N ratio and chemical composition of the residue, soil type, and soil water content; thus, a bench-scale incubation study was conducted to examine the effects of soil type and water content on N2O emissions associated with the decomposition of different crop residues. The study was carried out using soils from the Black, Dark Brown, Brown, and Gray soil zones and was conducted at both 50% and 70% water-filled pore space (WFPS); the soils were amended with 15N-labeled residues of wheat, pea, canola, and flax, or with an equivalent amount of 15N-labeled urea; 15N2O production was monitored using a Picarro G5101-i isotopic N2O analyzer.\nCrop residue additions to the soils resulted in both direct and indirect emissions of N2O, with residue derived emissions (RDE; measured as 15N2O) generally exceeding residue-induced emissions (RIE) at 50% WFPS—with RDEs ranging from 42% to 88% (mean = 58%) of the total N2O. Conversely, at 70% WFPS, RDEs were generally lower than RIEs—ranging from 21% to 83% (mean = 48%). Whereas both water content and soil type had an impact on N2O production, there was a clear and consistent trend in the emission factors for the residues; i.e., emissions were always greatest for the canola residue and lowest for the wheat residue and urea fertilizer; and intermediate for pea and flax. Results of this research demonstrate that—under the right environmental conditions—there is considerable potential for both direct and indirect N2O emissions during crop residue decomposition. Moreover, emission factors for the various crop residues tended to increase in the order: wheat ≤ urea < pea < flax << canola.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the potential impact of snow darkening caused by pre-industrial and present-day black carbon (BC) emissions on snow albedo and subsequently climate. To assess this impact, we implemented the effect of snow darkening caused by BC emitted from natural as well as anthropogenic sources into the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth System Model (MPI-M ESM). Considerable amounts of BC are emitted e.g. from fires and are transported through the atmosphere for several days before being removed by rain or snow precipitation in snow covered regions. Already very small quantities of BC reduce the snow reflectance significantly, with consequences for snow melting and snow spatial coverage.\nWe implemented the snow albedo reduction caused by BC contamination and snow aging in the one layer land surface component (JSBACH) of the atmospheric general circulation model ECHAM6, developed at MPI-M. For this we used the single-layer simulator of the SNow, Ice, and Aerosol Radiation (SNICAR-Online (Flanner et al., 2007); http://snow.engin.umich.edu) model to derive snow albedo values for BC in snow concentrations ranging between 0 and 1500 ng(BC)/g(snow) for different snow grain sizes for the visible (0.3 - 0.7 µm) and near infrared range (0.7 - 1.5 µm). As snow grains grow over time, we assign different snow ages to different snow grain sizes (50, 150, 500, and 1000 µm). Here, a radius of 50 µm corresponds to new snow, whereas a radius of 1000 µm corresponds to old snow. The deposition rates of BC on snow are prescribed from previous ECHAM6-HAM simulations for two time periods, pre-industrial (1880-1889) and present-day (2000-2009), respectively.\nWe perform a sensitivity study regarding the scavenging of BC by snow melt. To evaluate the newly implemented albedo scheme we will compare the modeled black carbon in snow concentrations to observed ones. Moreover, we will show the impact of the BC contamination and snow aging on the simulated snow albedo. The potential climate impact will be analyzed in terms of the radiative forcing caused by the snow darkening induced changes in surface albedo.",

            "abstract": "The wide variety of ice crystal shapes and growth habits makes it a complicated issue in cloud models. This study developed the bulk ice adaptive habit parameterization based on the theoretical approach of Chen and Lamb (1994) and introduced a 6-class hydrometeors double-moment (mass and number) bulk microphysics scheme with gamma-type size distribution function. Both the proposed schemes have been implemented into the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) model forming a new multi-moment bulk microphysics scheme. Two new moments of ice crystal shape and volume are included for tracking pristine ice’s adaptive habit and apparent density. A closure technique is developed to solve the time evolution of the bulk moments. For the verification of the bulk ice habit parameterization, some parcel-type (zero-dimension) calculations were conducted and compared with binned numerical calculations. The results showed that: a flexible size spectrum is important in numerical accuracy, the ice shape can significantly enhance the diffusional growth, and it is important to consider the memory of growth habit (adaptive growth) under varying environmental conditions. Also, the derived results with the 3-moment method were much closer to the binned calculations. A field campaign of DIAMET was selected to simulate in the WRF model for real-case studies. The simulations were performed with the traditional spherical ice and the new adaptive shape schemes to evaluate the effect of crystal habits. Some main features of narrow rain band, as well as the embedded precipitation cells, in the cold front case were well captured by the model. Furthermore, the simulations produced a good agreement in the microphysics against the aircraft observations in ice particle number concentration, ice crystal aspect ratio, and deposition heating rate especially within the temperature region of ice secondary multiplication production.",

            "abstract": "Commercial scale implementation of second generation (2G) biofuels has long been ‘just over the horizon – perhaps a decade away’. However, with recent innovations, and higher oil prices, we appear to be on the verge of finally seeing commercial scale implementations of cellulosic to liquid fuel conversion technologies. Interest in this technology derives from many quarters. Environmentalists see this as a way of reducing our carbon footprint, however, absent a global market for carbon emissions, private firms will not factor this into their investment decisions. Those interested in poverty and nutrition see this as a channel for lessening the biofuels’ impact on food prices. But what is 2G technology worth to society? How valuable are prospective improvements in this technology? And how are these valuations affected by future uncertainties, including climate regulation, climate change impacts, and energy prices? This paper addresses all of these questions.\nWe employ FABLE, a dynamic optimization model for the world’s land resources which characterizes the optimal long run path for protected natural lands, managed forests, crop and livestock land use, energy extraction and biofuels over the period 2005-2105. By running this model twice for each future state of the world – once with 2G biofuels technology available and once without – we measure the contribution of the technology to global welfare. Given the uncertainty in how these technologies are likely to evolve, we consider a range cost estimates – from optimistic to pessimistic. In addition to technological uncertainty, there is great uncertainty in the conditions characterizing our baseline for the 21st century. For each of the 2G technology scenarios, we therefore also consider a range of outcomes for key drivers of global land use, including: population, income, oil prices, climate change impacts and climate regulation. We find that the social valuation of 2G technologies depends critically on climate change regulations and future oil prices. In the base case with no climate policy and higher oil prices, the value of second generation biofuels is roughly $8 billion. With stringent climate change regulations in place, 2G biofuels are worth about fifty percent more.",

The TANDEM (Tsunamis in northern AtlaNtic : Definition of Effects by Modeling) project is a French initiative to draw lessons from the 2011 catastrophic tsunami in Japan on French coastlines, in order to provide guidance for risk assessment on the nuclear facilities in the area.\nThis project is aimed at adapting numerical methods of tsunami hazard assessment against the outstanding observation database of the 2011 tsunami, in order to apply these validated methods to the definition of the tsunami hazard for the French Atlantic and Channel coastlines.\nAs part of the TANDEM project, this work focuses on tsunami induced by landslides, and uses the CEA's model named AVALANCHE that can model simultaneously model a landslide and the resulting tsunami. AVALANCHE assumes that the landslide has a fluid-like behavior and applies shallow water/thin layer approximations to both aspect. The similarity of the resulting equations of momentum and mass conservation enables to use a single numerical scheme for both parts of the model.\nThe model is being submitted to several benchmarks to compare its response to analytical or experimental results. The first case compares the simulation result to the analytical result obtain by a fixed slide movement in one dimension and introduces the importance of the shallow water assumption in our results. The second case consists in the modeling of a wedge going down a slope and is compared to experimental results.\nThe last part of this work focuses on the continental slope of the Bay of Biscay off the South of France (NE Atlantic ocean). The slope presents scars left by large scale landslides. Investigation is carried out to identify the scenarios that could have caused paleo-tsunamis, with a special interest on the large scar of the Cap Breton (~100 millions m3). Several scenarios in this area are tested using the AVANLANCHE method in order to determine the potential threat.",

Sources and mineralisation of these groundwaters are derived from mutual discussion of d2H, d18O and d34S, major elements, rare earth distribution patterns and the (hydro)geological setting. Positive shift of d18O and d2H occur due to evaporation before replenishment and the interaction with basalts. Major infiltration areas for Golan Heights are the limy foothills of the Mt. Hermon and for the Ajloun Heights the Plateau itself. To a less degree, precipitation infiltrates also the basaltic catchments. Groundwaters are mineralised by water/rock (i) variably altered limestones by diagenesis, (ii) evaporates and seawater brines enclosed in limestone matrix and (iii) locally occurring basaltic intrusiva. In the Yarmouk Gorge, a deep-seated brine of the Ha’on type ascends and mixes with the fresh shallow groundwater.\nREY and isotope fingerprints prove that water from the Syrian Hauran Plateau is recharging springs and wells in the lowermost Yamouk Gorge. Although capping wide areas, the basaltic cover of the Golan Heights is of minor importance for recharge of the underlying A7/B2 aquifer, which becomes recharged at the foothills of Mt. Hermon and gets confined southwards, leading ibid. to ascension of water into the basaltic cover.\nAnomalous heat flux near the Yarmouk gorge and locally in the western escarpment of the Ajloun may be produced by ascending fluids from greater depth and/or by basaltic intrusions.",

            "abstract": "Many marsh grasses are capable of internal oxygen transport from aboveground sources to belowground roots and rhizomes, where oxygen may leak across the rhizodermis and oxygenate the surrounding sediment. In the field, the extent of sediment oxygenation in marshes was assessed in the rhizosphere of the marsh grass; Spartina anglica, inserting 70 optical fiber oxygen sensors into the rhizosphere. Two locations with S. anglica growing in different sediment types were investigated. No oxygen was detected in the rhizospheres indicating that belowground sediment oxygenation in S. anglica has a limited effect on the bulk anoxic sediment and is restricted to sediment in the immediate vicinity of the roots. In the laboratory, the presence of 1.5mm wide and 16mm long oxic root zones was demonstrated around root tips of S. anglica growing in permeable sandy sediment using planar optodes recording 2D-images of the oxygen distribution. Oxic root zones in S. anglica growing in tidal flat deposits were significantly smaller. The size of oxic roots zones was highly dynamic and affected by tidal inundations as well as light availability. Atmospheric air was the primary oxygen source for belowground sediment oxygenation, whereas photosynthetic oxygen production only played a minor role for the size of the oxic root zones during air-exposure of the aboveground biomass. During tidal inundations (1.5 h) completely submerging the aboveground biomass cutting off access to atmospheric oxygen, the size of oxic root zones were reduced significantly in the light and oxic root zones were completely eliminated in darkness. Sediment oxygenation in the rhizospheres of marsh grasses is of significant importance for marshes ability to retain inorganic nitrogen before it reaches the coastal waters. The presence of oxic roots zones promotes coupled nitrification-denitrification at depth in the sediment, which can account for more than 80% of the total denitrification in marshes.",

The spatial distribution of the K-H wave power in the equatorial plane shows two distinct power populations, referring to the two modes of K-H surface waves. The K-H instability starts at about 30o longitude, and grows exponentially with a spatial growth rate of 0.28 ~ 0.87 RE-1until ~45o longitude where the vortices fully develop. The wave frequency, wavelength, and phase speed are also given. The KH wavelength grows spatially with increasing distance from the sub-solar point tail-ward along the flank magnetopause. Model results show that the higher solar wind speed generates K-H waves with higher frequency under the northward IMF, and the wavelengths and the phase speeds increase with the increase of the longitude.

            "abstract": "Volcanic lightning observations made with the Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) from the 2009 eruption of Redoubt Volcano, Alaska, USA are used to probe the kinematic structure of a volcanic eruption column. Bruning and MacGorman (2013) used lightning flash energy spectra to show that the electrical and kinematic components of a thunderstorm may be coupled. They found that the flash energy spectra showed a 5/3 slope over length scales consistent with the turbulent kinetic energy inertial subrange expected for thunderstorms. They proposed that turbulence may influence the charge distribution in a cloud by advecting charge-bearing precipitation, which would affect flash rate and size. This analysis has now been applied to the lightning storms that occurred during the series of explosive eruptive events in the 2009 Redoubt eruption. Results show that the spectral shape of the volcanic lightning changed over the course of the storms. While volcanic forcing was active the flash energy was concentrated at small flash sizes and the spectra did not have the 5/3 spectral shape at the scales observed by Bruning and MacGorman (2013). 5-10 minutes after the volcanic forcing ended, the spectra transitioned a shape similar to their observations. This delay was inferred to be a relaxation period where the volcanic flow began to equilibrate to and blend with the background atmospheric flow. The lack of a 5/3 spectrum during the period of volcanic forcing could be because the inertial range of the plumes was on scales smaller than the detection limit of the LMA. Alternatively, this may be due to the nature of the forcing. The turbulent volcanic forcing was highly impulsive and short duration compared to the supercell thunderstorms studied by Bruning and MacGorman, which would have been in a quasi-steady state. The 5/3 spectrum represents an equilibrium where energy is transferred from an energy-maximum integral length scale down to the inertial range. Therefore, we would not expect to see 5/3 spectra where the convective system was still coming to equilibrium. These results show how lightning observations may be indicative of the kinematic state of a volcanic eruption column. ",

            "abstract": "In most Arctic areas the interplay between permafrost and parameters such as climate variability and geological history is not well understood or documented. Nevertheless, knowledge on the thermal state of permafrost, its thickness and ice/water content is crucial for a credible assessment of the impacts of surface warming on a suite of environmental processes such as groundwater flow to riverbeds and the release of methane from areas of degrading permafrost. We carried out geophysical surveys using non-invasive Magnetotelluric (MT) and Surface Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (SNMR) techniques to map permafrost occurrence in Adventdalen, Svalbard, a river valley in a typical coastal Arctic landscape. MT, which is sensitive to changes in the electrical conductivity and can be used to distinguish saline, fresh, and frozen soils, was used to determine the total thickness of permafrost (potentially several 100s of meters). SNMR, which is directly sensitive the volume of liquid water, was used to determine the unfrozen water content and the heterogeneity of permafrost at depths of up to ~100 m. We collected measurements in transects across and along the valley which is filled with Holocene estuarine sediments. MT observations suggest that permafrost thickens substantially to up to several hundreds of meters along the ~12 km long transect from the coastal area inland. The electrical resistivities observed are relatively low (~200-400 Ωm) when compared to permafrost environments in Alpine settings, which is most likely attributed to a high salinity of pore waters in our study area. In the parts of the valley above the marine limit (~70 m above sea-level) SNMR did not detect any unfrozen water content. However, closely spaced SNMR transects across the valley several kilometers from the coast show a substantial signal, potentially due to unfrozen water content in supra-permafrost taliks near the main river channel. This is the first study to illustrate the ability of combining MT and SNMR data to map permafrost characteristics in saline environments. Combining these geophysical measurements with auxiliary data on the pore water salinities, temperature and the geological makeup of the study area will allow a thorough determination of ice-content and thermal state of deep permafrost in this coastal permafrost environment.",

            "abstract": "The Andaman-Nicobar subduction is the northernmost segment of the Sumatra-Andaman subduction zone and marks the western boundary of the Andaman Sea, which is a complex backarc extensional basin. We present the interpretation of a new set of deep seismic reflection data acquired across the Andaman-Nicobar forearc basin, from 8°N to 11°N, to understand the structure and evolution of the forearc basin, focusing on how the obliquity of convergence affects deformation in the forearc, as well as on the Diligent (DF) and Eastern Margin Faults (EMF). Constraining the evolution of this basin, which is strongly related to the collision of India and Eurasia, can help shed light onto present-day deformation processes along this segment of the subduction zone, where convergence is highly oblique and little data is available. We find that he DF is a backthrust and corresponds to the Mentawai (MFZ) and West Andaman Fault (WAF) systems further south, offshore Sumatra. The DF is expressed as a series of mostly landward verging folds and faults, deforming the early to late Miocene sediments. The DF seems to root from the boundary between the accretionary complex and the continental backstop, where it meets the EMF. The EMF marks the western boundary of the forearc basin; it is associated with subsidence and is expressed as a deep piggyback basin, associated with recent Pliocene to Pleistocene subsidence at the western edge of the forearc basin. The eastern edge of the forearc basin is marked by the Invisible Bank (IB), which is thought to be tilted and uplifted continental crustal block. Subsidence along the EMF and uplift and tilting of the IB seem to be related to different opening phases in the Andaman Sea. The sliver Andaman-Nicobar Fault (ANF), which is the active northward extension of the Great Sumatra sliver Fault (GSF), lies to the east of the IB, and marks the boundary between continental crust underlying the forearc basin and crust accreted at the Andaman Sea Spreading Center.",

            "abstract": "The most commonly studied solar radiation management schemes reduce the amount of solar radiation absorbed by reflecting more sunlight in the stratosphere (eg. stratospheric injection of SO2) or by making marine clouds more reflective (eg. injection of sea salt into the marine boundary layer). Both these schemes require technologies that do not currently exist and involve polluting the atmosphere. An alternative scheme which brightens the surface of the ocean without the use of chemicals has so far been largely overlooked. The technology already exists to efficiently create 1µ radius bubbles in water. Such bubbles could enhance the albedo of open sea by 0.2 and have a lifetime of the order of days (Seitz, 2010). The top of atmosphere radiative forcing produced by the wakes of existing large ocean going vessels has been estimated to be 0.14 mWm-2 (Gatebe et al, 2011). However, existing ships are not optimised to produce such small bubbles; their wake lifetimes are in the order of minutes and their albedo gains are of the order of 0.02. If fitted with existing bubble generation technology, the current fleet of cargo and merchant ships could provide a surface radiative forcing of around -1 Wm-2.We present results from a climate model simulation implemented with this enhanced albedo in current shipping lanes. Currently ships are more abundant in the Northern Hemisphere but a larger and more uniform forcing could be produced by sending out extra ships with bubble generators in the more sparsely populated Southern Hemisphere oceans. Our climate model simulation with a uniform open sea albedo enhancement of 0.03 had an effective radiative forcing of -2.6 Wm-2 and reduced global mean temperature by 1.6 K, enough to offset global mean warming under RCP4.5 for at least 40 years.",

An automated LSPIV system is presented in this study, which can be easily set up and executed for continuous monitoring of flash flood. The experiment site is Longchi village, Sichuan Province, where 8.0 magnitude earthquake occurred in 2008 and debris flow happens every year since then. The interest of area is about 30m*40m of the channel which has been heavily destroyed by debris flow. Series of videos obtained during the flood season indicates that flood outbreaks after rainstorm just for several hours. Measurement is complete without being influenced by this extreme weather condition and results are more reliable and accurate due to high soil concentration. Compared with direct measurement by impellor flow meter, we validated that LSPIV works well at mountain stream, with index of 6.7% (Average Relative Error) and 95% (Nash-Sutcliffe Coefficient). On Jun 26, the maximum flood surface velocity reached 4.26 m/s, and the discharge based on velocity-area method was also decided. Overall, this system is safe, non-contact and can be adjusted according to our requirement flexibly.

The measurements were carried out in northern Sweden (mountain birch forest near Abisko, 68°N, 2004-2010), southern Sweden (forest bog near Hässleholm, 56°N, 2007-2014), northeastern Greenland (arctic fen in Zackenberg valley, 74°N, 2005-2014), southwestern Greenland (fen near Nuuk, 64°N, 2007-2014), central Svalbard (arctic fen near Longyearbyen, 78°N, 2011-2014). Those in total 37 seasons of measurements delivered not only a large amount of valuable flux data, including a few novel findings (Mastepanov et al., Nature, 2008; Mastepanov et al., Biogeosciences, 2013), but also valuable experience with implementation of the automatic chamber technique using modern analytical instruments and computer technologies.\nA range of high resolution CH4 analysers (DLT-100, FMA, FGGA – Los Gatos Research), CO2 analyzers (EGM-4, SBA-4 – PP Systems; Li-820 – Li-Cor Biosciences), as well as Methane Carbon Isotope Analyzer (Los Gatos Research) has shown to be suitable for precise measurements of fluxes, from as low as 0.1 mg CH4 m-1 d-1 (wintertime measurements at Zackenberg, unpublished) to as high as 2.4 g CH4 m-1 d-1 (autumn burst 2007 at Zackenberg, Mastepanov et al., Nature, 2008). Some of these instruments had to be customized to accommodate 24/7 operation in harsh arctic conditions. In this presentation we will explain some of these customizations.\nHigh frequency of concentration measurements (1 Hz in most cases) provides a unique opportunity for quality control of flux calculations; on the other hand, this enormous amount of data can be analyzed only using highly automated algorithms. A specialized software package was developed and improved through the years of measurements and data processing. This software automates the data flow from raw concentration data of different instruments and sensors and various status records, through a single database with all recorded parameters, to a visualized flux calculation module, which suggests the optimized flux calculation while allowing for manual correction of all parameters. In this presentation we will communicate the most recent versions of this software package and demonstrate it with different kinds of sample data.",

            "abstract": "Monsoonal freshwater runoff into the Bay of Bengal makes it one of the freshest oceans and results in a large spatial gradient in surface salinity (8-10 psu over 8-10 degrees longitude). Our aim is to understand dispersal and mixing of freshwater in the Bay of Bengal, its underlying mechanisms, and the spatial and temporal patterns of variability using Aquarius salinity data. Lateral stirring by the mesoscale flow field is a dominant mechanism for freshwater dispersal in this region. We track the satellite-observed salinity along water parcel trajectories calculated from satellite-derived surface velocity fields. By diagnosing the change in salinity along water parcel trajectories, we disentangle the effects of mesoscale lateral advection from other processes affecting the salinity, including evaporation-precipitation, vertical mixing, and smaller scale lateral dispersal. We attempt to relate the along-trajectory rate of change to flow characteristics such as strain rate, as well as to surface fluxes. Though Aquarius salinity measurements are limited in their spatial resolution, we find satellite along-track lateral salinity gradients to be representative of ship-based measurements at spatial scales greater than 9 km. However, the lack of reliable salinity and velocity fields near the coast makes it difficult to capture the largest salinity gradients. Our results show that during the early monsoon, water entering the Bay from the Arabian Sea at 6 degrees N freshens at a rate of about 0.1 psu/day. During the late monsoon, when freshwater is observed moving north to south along the western boundary of the Bay, other processes cause that fresh water mass to increase in salinity at a rate of about 0.4 psu/day. We provide an estimate for the rate at which unresolved processes dissipate lateral salinity gradients generated by the stirring of fresh and salty water.",

            "abstract": "When investigating the physics of turbulent media, as the solar wind or the magnetosheath plasmas, obtaining accurate Fourier spectra and phases is a crucial issue. For the different fields, the spectra allow in particular verifying whether one or several power laws can be determined in different frequency ranges. Accurate phases are necessary as well for all the \"higher order statistics\" studies in Fourier space, the coherence ones and for the polarization studies.\nUnfortunately, the Fourier analysis is not unique for a finite time interval of duration T: the frequencies lower than 1/T have a large influence on the result, which can hardly be controlled. This unknown \"trend\" has in particular the effect of superposing jumps at the edges of the interval, for the function under study itself, as well as for all its derivatives. The Fourier transform obtained directly by FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) is generally much influenced by these effects and cannot be used without care for wide band signals. The interferences between the jumps and the signal itself also provide \"hairs\" on the spectrum, which are clearly visible fluctuations with df≈1/T. These fluctuations are usually eliminated by smoothing the spectrum, or by averaging several successive spectra. Nevertheless, such smoothing introduces uncertainties on the spectral laws and it makes the phases lost. Windowing is also a method currently used to suppress the jumps, but it modifies the signal (the windowed trend has a spectrum, which is convolved with the searched one) and the phases are also lost to a large extent.\nHere, we present a new data processing technique to circumvent these difficulties. It takes advantage of the fact that the signal is generally not unknown out of the interval under study: the complete signal is tapered to this interval of interest thanks to a new kind of window, sharp but not square. This kind of window is such that the spectrum obtained can then be deconvolved almost exactly, through a minimization procedure based on the –weak- hypothesis that it is smooth at the scale of a few successive spectral points. Then, a later step allows reconstructing the phases.\nTests with synthetic data are presented, that demonstrate the efficiency of the method, and first results from Cluster data are also shown.",

            "abstract": "Observations from the interior of East Antarctica are essential for placing direct constraints on the ice sheet’s history over multiple glacial cycles, which also can be used to test numerical modeling of its past dynamics. In particular, laterally extensive, blue ice or ablation moraines are important archives of the former behavior of the EAIS and WAIS during at least the Pleistocene and Holocene. We can now quantify changes in the former ice surfaces using such deposits, which have been studied for decades, but have lacked chronological information. We are carrying out 10Be-26Al-3He dating and provenance initiatives at Mt. Achernar, near the head of the Law Glacier, where there is a well-preserved archive of ice sheet history extending spatially over 5-10 km and temporally over the last few hundred thousand years, during which time the climate swung between full glacial and warm interglacial changes. Here, concentric moraines are continuous and well preserved, and the entire complex is no higher than about ~30 meters above the modern EAIS surface. The cosmogenic ages steadily progress away from the EAIS, over 103 to 105 timescales. In addition, agreement of 10Be and 26Al concentrations indicate that, at least over the long term, blue ice deposits at Mt Achernar do not have a complicated history of burial and re-exposure. This is consistent with the inferred process of blue ice moraine formation that involves debris coming up from below and accumulating on the surface, when ice encounters the Transantarctic Mountains. Based on our findings we conclude that the interior of EAIS has been relatively stable for the last few 100 kyr, with ice surface elevation changes on the order of tens of meters, including 20-30 meters since the LGM. In a net sense, the EAIS has also been getting slightly lower over the last half million years or so. We hypothesize that if the interior of the EAIS had undergone major lowering or more pronounced surface changes over the time represented, we would not observe the well-preserved continuous blue ice moraines and associated overall progression in ages with distance from the EAIS.",

            "abstract": "This numerical study aims at understanding the impact of the bottom topography on the stability of a geostrophic surface coastal current and the formation of coastal meanders and eddies.\nA continuously stratified model is used, extending the analysis presented in Poulin et al., 2014 for a two-layer stratification. Simulations are performed using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). We use an idealized periodic channel configuration with a geostrophic coastal current jet (modeled with a linear-gaussian profile) flowing along an hyperbolic tangent shelf bathymetry. The impact of the shelf bathymetry on the current stability is assessed by varying the shelf slope, the depth under the current jet and the vertical stratification (i.e. the first baroclinic deformation radius), while the geostrophic current remains unchanged.\nThree distinct dynamical regimes are identified: a standard baroclinic instability, characterized by large mesoscale anticyclones that detach from the current; a trapped coastal instability, with small eddies propagating along the shelf and showing a marked baroclinic nature, i.e. anticyclonic (cyclonic) structures in the upper layer and cyclonic (anticyclonic) structures in the lower layer; finally, a stronger topographic stabilization leads to a weakly unstable current with no eddies formation. Three governing parameters are used to distinguish the three regimes, namely: the topographic parameter (Tp), a depths ratio (γ) and the Burger number (Bu). Besides, we show that the non-linear amplitude of the unstable perturbations is controlled by the shelf bathymetry. In the standard baroclinic regime, the unstable perturbations reach a finite amplitude leading to the formation of large meanders and mesoscale eddies. In the trapped coastal instability regime, both the meanders amplitude and the unstable wavelength are reduced. Once the first coastal eddies are formed along the shelf, a secondary process breaks them out and lead to sub-mesoscale perturbations. This direct cascade towards small scale induces a re-stabilization of the coastal current.",

            "abstract": "The ion foreshock located upstream of the Earth's bow shock is populated with ions reflected back by the shock front. In-situ spacecraft measurements have clearly established the existence of two distinct populations in the upstream of the quasi-perpendicular shock region (i.e. for 45o ≤ ΘBn≤ 90o, where ΘBn is the angle between the shock normal and the upstream magnetostatic field): (i) field-aligned ion beams (or 'FAB') characterized by a gyrotropic distribution, and (ii) gyro-phase bunched ions (or 'GPB') characterized by a NON gyrotropic distribution, which exhibits a non-vanishing perpendicular bulk velocity.\nThe use of 2D PIC simulations where full curvature effects, time of flight effects and both electrons and ions dynamics are fully described, has evidenced that the shock front itself can be the possible source of these two characteristic populations.\nA recent analysis has evidenced that both populations can be discriminated in terms of interaction time (Δtinter) with the shock front. 'GPB' and 'FAB' populations are characterized by a short (Δtinter ~ 1 τci) and much larger (Δtinter ≥ 2 τci) interaction time respectively, where τci is the ion upstream gyroperiod.\nIn addition, present statistical results evidence that:\n(i) backstreaming ions are splitted into 'FAB' and 'GPB' populations depending on their injection angle when hitting the shock front (defined between the local normal to the shock front and the gyration velocity vector).\n(ii) As a consequence, ion trajectories strongly differ between the 'FAB' and 'GPB' populations at the shock front. In particular, 'FAB' ions suffer multi-bounces along the curved front whereas 'GPB' ions make only one bounce. Such differences may explain why the 'FAB' population loses their gyro-phase coherency and become gyrotropic which is not the case for the 'GPB'.\nThen, the differences observed between 'FAB' and 'GPB' populations do not involve some distinct reflection processes as often claimed in the literature but follow from different particle time histories at the shock front. Both 'FAB' and 'GPB' ions suffer the same reflection process but only 'FAB' population loose their initial phase coherency by suffering several bounces. This important result was not expected and greatly simplifies the question of their origin.",

            "abstract": "NASA has conducted airborne tropospheric chemistry studies for about three decades. These field campaigns have generated a great wealth of observations, which are characterized by a wide range of trace gases and aerosol properties. The airborne observational data have often been used in assessment and validation of models and satellite instruments. One particular issue is a lack of consistent variable naming across field campaigns, which makes cross-mission data discovery difficult. The ASDC Toolset for Airborne Data (TAD) is being designed to meet the user community needs for manipulating aircraft data for scientific research on climate change and air quality relevant issues. As part of this effort, a common naming system was developed to provide a link between variables from different aircraft field studies. This system covers all current and past airborne in-situ measurements housed at the ASDC, as well as select NOAA missions. The TAD common variable naming system consists of 6 categories and 3 sub-levels. The top-level category is primarily defined by the physical characteristics of the measurement: e.g., aerosol, cloud, trace gases. The sub-levels were designed to organize the variables according to nature of measurement (e.g., aerosol microphysical and optical properties) or chemical structures (e.g., carbon compound). The development of the TAD common variable naming system was in consultation with staff from the Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) and referenced/expanded the existing Climate and Forecast (CF) variable naming conventions. The detailed structure of the TAD common variable naming convention and its application in TAD development will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The impacts of biomass burning aerosol on global and regional climate are highly dependent on the accurate representation of BB emissions, aerosol processses and aerosol optical properties. The simulation of BB aerosol properties has been substantially improved in the Met Office Hadley Centre Global Environment Model (HadGEM3) with the introduction of GLOMAP-mode, a modal aerosol scheme developed as part of United Kingdom Chemistry and Aerosol project (UKCA). The aerosol size distribution, composition, absorption properties and vertical distributions are shown to compare well against aircraft and ground-based observations from the South American Biomass Burning Analysis (SAMBBA). However, as with many models, it is necessary to scale BB aerosol emissions up by a factor of 2 - 4 to gain agreement with observed AODs (MODIS, AERONET) and mass concentrations from ground observations and aircraft profiles. The necessary scaling factor depends on the emission dataset, the assumed injection height and the efficiency of aerosol wet removal processes in the atmospheric model. These findings will be demonstrated with HadGEM3 simulations related to an AEROCOM phase III experiment on biomass burning. Finally, the effective radiative forcing of the BB aerosol (including aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud impacts) is shown to be highly dependent assumptions related to black carbon and the absorption of solar radiation.",

There is a signature of increasing trend in temperature and decreasing trend in the seasonal monsoon rainfall. Impact of drought years on the sugarcane crop has been determined. To quantify the climate change the Land use Land cover (LULC) classification of the region is carried out and the relative changes in different LULC classes are discussed, which shows the agriculture is being decreased in 14 years of the analysis. Then to know the impact of climate parameters and on the sugarcane crop production, the correlation analysis of the climate parameters and sugarcane yield are presented using the real observation and which clearly showed the solar radiation is highly correlated with the sugarcane production compared to other climate parameters (Figure 1). The satellite derived NDVI is used to compute the NDVI Grand Growth Period [∑NDVI(GGP)] and the correlation of it with sugarcane crop yield for the period 2000-2013 and the empirical relation is derived, which can be implemented in future with some weather forecasting models like General Circulation Model (GCM) for the prediction of the sugarcane yield in advance.",

            "abstract": "Global seismic studies show variations near the base of mantle transition zone, where some slabs penetrate straight into the lower mantle, whereas others seem to flatten. The dynamics of cold subducting slabs are mainly controlled by negative thermal buoyancy forces and by buoyancy anomalies due to density contrasts of the different mineralogical phases. Recent experiments show that pyroxene dissolves into the denser garnet, forming the majorite-garnet, at very slow rates, and pyroxene can remain metastable to temperatures as high as 1400 °C.\nBecause metastable pyroxene may potentially persist in subduction zones over large volumes and to great depths, a self-consistent subduction model has been used to investigate the influence of metastable phase on the dynamics of subducting oceanic lithosphere. The phase boundary of pyroxene to garnet (300 km equilibrium depth) is considered together with the phase transition of olivine to wadsleyite (410 km equilibrium), and ringwoodite to perovskite-magnesiowustite (670 km equilibrium). The kinetics of the phase transition for ol-wd and in px-gt are treated considering a temperature-dependent diffusion rate. To quantify the buoyant contributions of the metastable phase on the subduction dynamics, an extensive parameter sensitivity study has been performed.\nResults from this study illustrate that metastable pyroxene affects slab buoyancy at least as much as olivine metastability. Slab age and phase change kinetics are the most dominant parameters, and buoyancy effects are stronger for old subducting lithosphere and for low diffusion rates, favouring slab stagnation in the transition zone.",

            "abstract": "We explore the potential implications of the recently signed United Nations Minamata Convention on Mercury for emissions from coal-fired power generation in Asia, and the impacts of these emissions changes on deposition of mercury worldwide by 2050. We use qualitative interviews, document analysis, and engineering analysis to create plausible technology scenarios consistent with the Convention, taking into account both technological and political factors. We translate these scenarios into possible emissions inventories for 2050, based on IPCC development scenarios, and then use the GEOS-Chem global transport model to evaluate the effect of these different technology choices on mercury deposition over geographic regions and oceans. We find that China is most likely to address mercury control through co-benefits from technologies for SO2, NOx, and particulate matter (PM) capture that will be required to attain its existing air quality goals. In contrast, India is likely to focus on improvements to plant efficiency such as upgrading boilers, and coal washing. Compared to current technologies, we project that these changes will result in emissions decreases of approximately 140 and 190 Mg/yr for China and India respectively in 2050, under an A1B development scenario. With these emissions reductions, simulated average gross deposition over India and China are reduced by approximately 10 and 3 μg/m2/yr respectively, and the global average concentration of total gaseous mercury (TGM) is reduced by approximately 10% in the Northern hemisphere. Stricter, but technologically feasible, requirements for mercury control in both countries could lead to an additional 200 Mg/yr of emissions reductions. Modeled differences in concentration and deposition patterns between technology suites are due to differences in both the mercury removal efficiency of technologies and their resulting stack speciation.",

            "abstract": "Unlike the majority of biomineralization, mediated via proteins, the coccolithophores employ acidic polysaccharides (CAPs) as the template for the multitude of intricate calcium carbonate liths which are precipitated inside their cells and expelled to form an external spherical armour. Massive accumulations of these calcium carbonate coccoliths (we estimate a flux of ~ 6x1025 liths/year) form sediments on the deep seafloor, a dominant sink of carbon from the atmosphere over geological timescales, and a buffer for seawater chemistry. This acidic, coccolith-associated polysaccharide (CAP) plays a dual role, likely determined by the calcifying vesicle chemistry, promoting and limiting precipitation.\nWe have developed and demonstrated novel techniques for the extraction and characterisation of these biomineral-mediating molecules, encapsulated and preserved within liths from sediments as old as the Mesozoic. Modern cultures of extant coccolithophores show that the composition of CAP is distinctive for different species, and even strains of e.g. Emiliania huxleyi, suggestive that interactions with galacturonic acid residues are key to dictating the architecture of the liths. Furthermore, it appears that the galacturonic acid content reflects an adaptive response of the CAP to the chemistry within the coccolith vesicle where calcification is induced; in particular the size of the internal carbon pool and inferred saturation state. Extraction of CAPs from the Coccolithale fraction of sediments suggests that the galacturonic acid content of these relatively large and inefficient carbon concentrators evolves in response to declining CO2 availability and thus may provide a novel means for reconstructing paleo pCO2.",

The CUAHSI Water Data Center (WDC) is designed to fulfill the first need. Indeed, the technology employed by the WDC would enable the same data system to be viewed as part of mutliple networks, thus overcoming the traditional \"stove-piping\" of field sites by funding source and will support the kind of cross-network, multi-scale analyses needed for scientific advancement. Additional data compilations, such as a catalog of field sites, is also being considered, but incentives to participate in such efforts need to exist to make them successful.\nThe WDC has initially focused on supporting time series data and has recently introduced support for publishing spatial data coverages. These services, although necessary, are recognized to be insufficient for these studies. We are examining additional services to facilitate scientific collaboration, including both remote collaboration and in-person meetings to support self-forming working groups.

            "abstract": "Natural wetlands are important emitters of the potent greenhouse gas methane (CH4), contributing an estimated 26 - 42% to the global emissions. In these habitats CH4 is generated by methanogenic archaea mediating the terminal steps of organic matter degradation under anoxic conditions. The produced CH4 is partly oxidized by methanotrophic bacteria in oxic zones, thereby mitigating CH4 release. Various factors can influence CH4 emissions from wetlands, including the presence of vascular plants, as their aerenchyma can serve as conduits for CH4 release to the atmosphere. In the present study, we investigated the CH4 dynamics in two Swiss alpine fens (1900 - 2300 m a.s.l), and sampling locations within these fens were characterized by distinct dominant vascular plants, namely Carex spp. and Eriophorum spp.. Analyses of the microbial communities present in the fen soils were complemented by in situ measurements of CH4 emissions and analyses of physico-chemical pore water properties. Methane emissions and pore water concentrations varied depending on fen and dominating plant species, with generally higher CH4 emissions observed from the Carex dominated locations. Active methanotrophic and methanogenic microorganisms (transcripts of specific marker genes) were detected at different depths, independent of O2 and CH4 pore water concentrations. The expected separation of oxic methanotrophic and anoxic methanogenic zones was not observed. Yet, composition analyses of the different communities showed a clear clustering according to fen and dominating plant species. Within each location, variation of composition with depth was only observed for the methanogenic communities. Detailed profiling of CH4 emissions with respect to changes in light and temperature is currently being carried out. Our results represent a comprehensive in situ study on factors affecting CH4 emissions from alpine fens, highlighting the influence of vascular plants on the microbial communities involved.",

            "abstract": "Glacier movement is attributed to a sensitive configuration of driving forces. Here, we present an approach designed to evaluate the drivers of movement at Sólheimajökull, an outlet glacier from the Myrdalsjökull ice cap, Iceland, through combining terrestrial time-lapse photography and laser scanning (TLS). A time-lapse camera (a dSLR with intervalometer and solar-recharged battery power supply) collected hourly data over the summer of 2013. The data are subject to all the difficulties that are usually present in long time-lapse sequences, such as highly variable illumination and visibility conditions, evolving surfaces, and camera instabilities. Feature-tracking software [1] was used to: 1) track regions of static topography (e.g. the skyline) from which camera alignment could be continuously updated throughout the sequence; and 2) track glacial surface features for velocity estimation. Absolute georeferencing of the image sequence was carried out by registering the camera to a TLS survey acquired at the beginning of the monitoring period. A second TLS survey (July 2013) provided an additional 3D surface. By assuming glacial features moved in approximately planimetrically straight lines between the two survey dates, combining the two TLS surfaces with the monoscopic feature tracking allows 3D feature tracks to be derived. Such tracks will enable contributions from different drivers (e.g. surface melting) to be extracted, even in imagery that is acquired not perpendicular to glacier motion. At Sólheimajökull, our aim is to elucidate any volcanic contribution to the observed movement.\n[1] http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/jamesm/software/pointcatcher.htm",

            "abstract": "In modern coastal systems, the sensitivity of a coastal site to erosion or deposition during storm conditions depends largely on the geomorphic configuration (e.g. dune or beach height and width) and the storm-induced oceanographic processes (surge and waves). Depending on the magnitude of these variables, coastal systems may be eroded, overwashed, breached, and/or inundated during the storm. To date, there has been no attempt to evaluate how these observable modern differences in storm-impact regimes might be utilized to interpret paleo-storm intensities and frequencies. Time-series of sediment texture, radioisotopic, and foraminiferal data from back-barrier environments along the Chandeleur Islands (Louisiana, USA) document the emplacement of a storm event deposit from Hurricane Isaac and we use this event to test paleo-storm intensity reconstruction methods. Water level reconstructed for the event layer using an advection (grain-size) settling model are 2 – 3 times greater than measured during the storm. The over-estimation is linked to the reconstruction model’s assumptions concerning sediment transport during storms (i.e., overwash only), while actual processes included inundation as well. These contrasts may result in misidentification (i.e., presence/absence) and/or misclassification (i.e., intensity) of storms in the geologic record (e.g., low geomorphic conditions and high water levels) that would in turn affect the ability to link storm frequency or intensity to climatic drivers.",

            "abstract": "Pyroclastic material from basaltic eruptions takes many forms, including ash, scoria, spatter, and clastigenic flows. These products define a spectrum that is a function of clast temperature, how clasts interact with each other when deposited, and the extent of welding or fusing as clasts cool. The pyroclastic deposit properties depend largely on microscopic structures developed at clast interfaces: a) scoria clasts retain their original shapes after deposition; b) agglutinated clasts deform but have a limited weld; c) stronger welding occurs when neighboring clasts deform and their contacts are fused; and d) fusion results when clasts have completely merged with one other. We examine conditions necessary to produce spatter using 2 experimental approaches: small-scale tests in a muffle furnace, which vary the parameters of clast size, deposit thickness, and temperature; and large-scale tests at Syracuse University’s Lava Project facility. Starting material is Keweenaw Peninsula basalt (~50 wt.% SiO2, 7.5 wt.% FeO, 7.3 wt.% MgO). In the furnace, pea-sized chips (0.5-7 mm) begin to deform at 1100oC, and agglutination occurs from 1100 to 1150oC, with clasts beginning to weld ~1125oC. Clasts are completely molten at ~1150oC. Furthermore, the thicker the deposit, the more extensive the welding in the middle, owing to greater heat retention by overlying material. To examine the role of clast size, crushed samples were sieved into 3 fractions and heated; the smallest clasts with the most surface area and least thermal mass were most extensively welded. Finally, temperature experiments reveal that at 1100oC, boundaries between clasts are 29% welded (extent of welding is measured by comparing the length of welded contacts between clasts with that of unwelded contacts in SEM images). At 1125oC, clasts are 62% welded, and at 1150oC, they are fully welded. Above 1150oC, clast shapes are no longer discernable. These results are consistent with work by Rader (2014), conducted at 1130oC on basalts from Devil’s Garden, OR. Our results indicate that a potentially wide window exists for spatter formation, depending on eruptive temperature and cooling rates upon deposition. We will also report results from large-scale simulations performed at the Syracuse University facility in late August.",

            "abstract": "Hubbard Glacier is one of the few advancing tidewater glaciers in the world, offering a premier opportunity for studying ice/sediment/seawater interactions at a tidewater glacier front that is in contact with the stabilizing submarine morainal bank. However, the seafloor and water column proximal to the ice face of a marine-terminating glacier is one of the most challenging and extreme environments imaginable for marine survey work. Frequently choked with constantly-shifting mélange ice at the sea surface and at risk from calving, surface vessels cannot operate safely proximal to the ice face. AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) technology provides an opportunity to survey in areas where surface vessels cannot. Operating well below the sea surface the AUV can operate without hindrance or danger to human operators. In addition, the AUV can be programmed to operate close to the seafloor at a constant altitude, enabling the finest-detail currently possible for acoustic seafloor mapping and consistent resolution irrespective of water depth. With these considerations in mind, we conducted a proof-of-concept survey of the Hubbard Glacier morainal bank in June, 2014. We utilized the Bluefin 9M, the smallest of their line of AUVs. Its size enabled deployment and recovery from a small charter fishing vessel well-suited to navigating through mélange-choked waters. The AUV’s payload included a Klein UUV-3500 interferometric sonar (455/900 kHz), which enables acquisition of sidescan backscatter and swath bathymetry up to ~75 m to each side of the instrument from ~10 m altitude over the seabed, and sensors for measuring conductivity, temperature, depth (CTD) and optical backscatter (OBS). Although our operations were shortened due to an unfortunate failure in the sonar electronics, sufficient data were collected along the morainal bank to clearly prove the viability of AUV operations in this harsh environment. The data provide centimeter-scale seafloor detail close to the glacier in regions that could not be surveyed with surface vessels. We observed a number of intricate geomorphic features in the raw images that are to our knowledge without precedent. Of particular interest are a series of barchan-shaped bedforms that may provide evidence of significant turbidity flows down the face of the morainal bank.",

            "abstract": "Biochar application to soil is widely proposed as a means of sequestering carbon (C) in soils to aid climate change mitigation while concurrently improving crop yields. Other benefits include issues such as waste disposal. While there are numerous studies investigating the effects of biochar application to agricultural systems, the impact of application to grasslands is still an understudied area. We studied the impact of biochar application on aboveground (plant) and belowground community composition and effects on the functional repertoire of soil microbial communities under a semi-natural grassland in the Netherlands. We investigated the impacts and the underlying mechanisms behind observed effects. We found that biochar application to soil caused a transient competitive effect, enhancing legumes biomass when compared to grasses and forbs. Biological nitrogen fixation was shown to increase following biochar application, with potassium (K) introduced with the biochar the most likely reason. Furthermore, we found lasting effects on the functional repertoire of the soil microbial communities after three seasons. Different responses to C substrate additions of field soil under laboratory conditions indicated lasting effects on C utilisation of soil microbial communities following biochar application. Stable isotope techniques showed pyrolysis to increase the predicted C residence time in soil from ~30 years to >520 years as well as reducing N availability by ~70% compared to the unpyrolysed feedstock. Combined, these results suggest biochar production and application can be used to control the nutrient status of grasslands while concurrently storing C for extended periods. These results have implications for grassland management, including grazed pastures which may benefit from increased BNF. Further they demonstrate the potential of grasslands for climate change mitigation through increased C storage following biochar application.",

            "abstract": "Hydrothermal plumes are generated by high temperature hydrothermal venting systems occurred at many places along the mid-ocean ridges. The understanding of interaction between plumes and surrounding seawater are important since plumes transport significant heat and chemicals from the lithosphere to the ocean. This paper presents an experimental study on plume generation, mixing, entrainment and rising in a stratified salt water tank. The two-tank method is first improved to produce a stable linear stratification in the tank. A series of plume experiments using different orifice diameters and fluxes are then carried out to evaluate the characteristics of plumes. The stratification of salt water is measured and buoyancy frequency is calculated to provide the background information. The plume shape, flow field, rise height, and buoyancy flux are analyzed using image processing methods. The results show that the established experimental system is capable of providing stable linear stratifications for laboratory studies of hydrothermal plumes. The measured plume shapes and rise heights are in good agreement with available empirical formulae in the literature.",

            "abstract": "In the minutes to weeks after a landslide trigger such as an earthquake or heavy rain, tens to thousands of landslides may occur across a region, resulting in simultaneous blockages across the road network, which can impact recovery efforts. In this paper, we show the development, application and confrontation with observed data, of a model to semi-stochastically simulate triggered landslide events and their impact on road network topologies. In this model, “synthetic” triggered landslide event inventories are created by randomly selecting landslide sizes and shapes from already established statistical distributions. The landslides are then semi-randomly distributed over the region’s road network, where they are more or less likely to land based on a landslide susceptibility map. The number, size and network impact of the road blockages is then calculated. This process is repeated in a Monte Carlo type simulation to assess a range of scenarios. Due to the generally applicable statistical distributions used to create the synthetic triggered landslide event inventories and the relatively minimal data requirements to run the model, the model is theoretically applicable to many regions of the world where triggered landslide events occur. Current work focuses on applying the model to two regions: (i) the Collazzone basin (79 km2) in Central Italy where 422 landslides were triggered by rapid snowmelt in January 1997, (ii) the Oat Mountain quadrangle (155 km2) in California, USA, where 1,350 landslides were triggered by the Northridge Earthquake (M = 6.7) in January 1994. When appropriate adjustments are made to susceptibility in the immediate vicinity of the roads, model results match reasonably well observations. In Collazzone (length of road = 153 km, landslide density = 5.2 landslides km-2), the median number of road blockages over 100 model runs was 5 (±2.5 s.d.), compared to the observed number of 5. In Northridge (length of road = 780 km, landslide density = 8.7 landslides km-2), the median number of road blockages over 100 model runs was 108 (±17.2 s.d.) compared to the observed number of 48. As model development progresses, we hope that this open source tool can be applied to other locations to aid civil protection agencies in exploring the potential impact to the road network of triggered landslide events.",

Due to manual measurement methods being costly and time consuming, and traditional visual observation methods being subjective, we have explored the use of a close-range remote sensing approach, based on through-water photography to estimate channel characteristics. Previous similar photo-based measurements have focused on estimating water depth by correcting data from stereo image pairs for refraction at the water surface. Here, we extend this approach to multi-image data sets, and implement refraction correction for data from commonly used ‘structure from motion’ based software. The accuracy of applied corrections is assessed in a laboratory setting using a gravel surface submerged at a range of water depths. We demonstrate the approach in the field by photographing cross sections to produce high density point clouds and hence digital elevation models of the stream bed. Correcting submerged regions for refraction effects allows channel characteristics such as wetted perimeter and water depth to be estimated. We explore the use of parameters thus estimated for deriving coefficients of channel flow resistance such as Manning’s coefficient.",

            "abstract": "A well-preserved set of mid-Miocene tuff-cones and their feeders outcrop in the Jičín Volcanic Field, Czech Republic. Zebín Hill is a tuff cone that has been quarried to reveal the volcanoes feeder system. This edifice offers the opportunity to understand how magma is transported through a monogenetic pyroclastic cone. Rock types include a coarse-grained basal phreatomagmatic layer and a stratified upper wall facies both of which are penetrated by feeder dikes. Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) and paleomagnetic data were collected at twenty-one sites from feeder dikes and the main conduit of the volcano. A high-resolution ground magnetometry survey, electric resistivity tomography and seismic tomography were also conducted. Magnetic susceptibility intensity indicates that the dominant magnetic mineral is a ferromagnetic phase with little contribution from paramagnetic minerals. AMS ellipsoids shapes are both oblate and prolate and inferred magma flow directions indicate magma flow away from the central vent area and subhorizontal flow towards and away from the axial conduit; both upward and downward magma flow is evident at some sites. Curie point estimates yield a spectrum of results indicating a mixture of high-Ti titanomagnetite, iron sulfide, and low-Ti titanomagnetite. Ground magnetometry data indicate that both normal and reverse polarity rocks are present at Zebín Hill. Paleomagnetic data confirm the ground magnetic data in that both normal and reverse polarity rocks are present. Most sites yield a single component magnetization that is well grouped at the site level and carried by pseudosingle domain titanomagnetite. The presence of both normal and reverse polarity magnetizations from the volcano indicate that significant time passed during the growth of this monogenic system. Complex system of branching dikes has been also observed from electric resistivity tomography. The simple external structure of monogenetic volcanoes hides a rather complex magmatic plumbing system that dynamically evolves during the life of the volcano. As we show, the well-exposed roots of Zebín Hill reveals that the growth of a volcano occurs not due to simple central axis feeder systems but rather through interplay of local structures, magmatic effects, and construct evolution during the life of the volcano",

            "abstract": "Contemporary sensing equipment is miniaturized to scales that enable implementation of dynamic micro-sensors within natural sediment particles (>c.80mm diameter) containing artificial enclosures. The resulting mobile sensing units record the dynamics of sediment transport from the inertial frame of individual particles, giving an insight on how individual grains experience transporting forces. However, it remains difficult to obtain accurate real-time positional information which is critical for understanding the dynamic data. We have developed a sensing system optimized for monitoring the movement of sediment grains in rivers, which comprises a high-frequency 3-D force unit and an external magnetic telemetry system for accurate positional information. Here we present results from the experimental evaluation of two prototype mobile sensors: the first prototype is a spherically enclosed wireless accelerometer platform (± 6g range) tested through a series of incipient motion experiments under varying slope conditions (0.8 m x 5 m flume, slope range: 0.026 to 0.57, flow increase: 0.037 l.s-2, University of British Columbia). The second prototype is a complete Inertial Measurement Unit (assembly of a 3-axis micro-accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer capable of resolving 9 Degrees Of Freedom for the movement of the unit), enhanced with a 3-axis high-resolution impact sensor calibrated for low frequency/high magnitude impacts (±150g range) and equipped with a system of magnetic coil receivers permitting telemetric tracking of the unit with a 4 Hz frequency. This unit was tested through experiments of sequential displacements under varying flow increase (gradual increase: 0.04 l.s-2, episodic increase: 0.1 l.s-2, 0.9 m x 7.5 m flume, slope: 0.02, University of Glasgow). The position was recorded from a lab-scale Magneto-Inductive tracking system and the positional accuracy was tested by cross-comparison with a video recording. Along with the presented results we discuss how the nature, high-resolution and accuracy of the derived measurements mean that collected data can be used to existing deterministic and stochastic models for fluvial bedload transport.",

            "abstract": "Formation mechanism of barrier layers (BLs) in the subtropical Pacific was investigated by using Argo profiling float data and shipboard hydrographic section data. In this region, BLs were formed mainly in winter in association with the sea surface salinity (SSS) front, which was located on the equator side of the SSS maximum region. While BLs from gridded Argo data were broadly distributed, their distribution from raw Argo profiles was patchy and their temporal scale was shorter than 10 days. Formation mechanism of BLs was attributed to two processes: freshening near the sea surface and salinification in the subsurface. As for the former process, poleward Ekman advection of fresher water from the tropics across the SSS front was dominant, while the effect of precipitation was small. As for the latter process, inflow of high salinity water into mixed layers associated with the SSS front can contribute to the BL formation, but actually the core of subducted Tropical Water was too deep to affect salinity structure in the mixed layers across the seasonal thermocline. These features strongly suggest that tilting of the SSS front is essentially important for the BL formation in the subtropical Pacific. This tilting process can only occur where the contribution of horizontal SSS gradient to the horizontal density gradient is strong, and explains why spatial distribution of BLs corresponded to the SSS front. Seasonal variation of BLs corresponded well to that of mixed layer depth, indicating that the deeper mixed layers are before the BL formation, the thicker BLs are formed when the SSS front is tilted.",

            "abstract": "A new method has been developed for the rapid analysis of metal concentrations and stable isotope ratios using a prepFAST automated sample processing robot. Although concentrations and isotopes are processed separately, similar methods are used for both. Initially all seawater is acidified to pH 2. Then Nobias resin with EDTA/IDA functional groups is added to either 10mL of sample for concentrations or ~1L samples for isotopes. Fe binds to the resin at low pH, and the pH is subsequently raised to allow Zn and Cd to bind. For concentration analyses, all subsequent chemistry is automated on the prepFAST including removal of seawater, rinsing of resin, and elution of resin into acid. For isotope samples these extraction techniques are performed manually, but the subsequent purification of Fe, Zn, and Cd by anion exchange chromatography is automated using the prepFAST. With these new methods, samples from the US GEOTRACES cruise GP16, in the eastern tropical South Pacific, are being analyzed.\nHigh concentrations of dissolved Fe are observed near the continental shelf and near submarine hydrothermal vents. Interestingly, isotope data show that dissolved Fe near the continental shelf generally has a δ56Fe close to 0 ‰. This δ56 Fe signature is suggestive of a non-reductive dissolution source for Fe, as Fe(II) released by reductive dissolution is typically closer to -2 ‰. Preliminary data show nutrient-type profiles for Zn and Cd, with Zn matching Si and Cd having a similar distribution to P. An increase in dissolved Zn near hydrothermal vents suggests a possible hydrothermal zinc source to the deep ocean. Continuing analysis of isotope data will reveal more about the source and biogeochemical cycling of these three chemically and biologically important trace metals throughout the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean.",

To retain the amplitude ratio information between vertical and horizontal components, for each station, we perform daily noise pre-processing (temporal normalization and spectrum whitening) simultaneously for all three components. For each station pair, amplitude measurements between cross-correlations of different components (radial–radial, radial–vertical, vertical–radial and vertical–vertical) are then used to determine the Rayleigh-wave H/V ratios at the two station locations. Measurements from all available station pairs are used to determine isotropic and directionally dependent Rayleigh-wave H/V ratios at each location between 8- and 24-second period. The isotropic H/V ratio maps, combined with previous longer period Rayleigh-wave H/V ratio maps from earthquakes and Rayleigh-wave phase velocity maps from both ambient noise and earthquakes, are used to invert for a new 3-D isotropic crustal and upper-mantle model in the western United States. The new model has an outstanding vertical resolution in the upper crust and tradeoffs between different parameters are mitigated. A clear 180-degree periodicity is observed in the directionally dependent H/V ratio measurements for many locations where upper crustal anisotropy is likely strong. Across the US, good correlation is observed between the inferred fast directions in the upper crust and documented maximum compressive stress directions. This suggests that the observed H/V ratio anisotropy can potentially be used to infer static stress field across the US.",

The RAL ozone profile algorithm has been selected as the prototype nadir processor to produce a climate quality dataset for community use from GOME, SCIAMACHY, OMI and GOME-2A/B as part of the ESA Climate Change Initiative. We present time-series’ of data as compared to ozonesondes and extensive comparison with chemistry transport, air quality models and MACC-II.\nThe RAL algorithm additionally combines measurements in the UV and IR, from GOME-2 and IASI aboard MetOp. The jointly retrieved product exploits the complementary vertical sensitivity of the two instruments, particularly in the troposphere.\nIt can be shown with retrieval simulations that use of visible spectra could significantly add information about near-surface ozone to conventional UV ozone profile retrievals – particularly over land – which has implications for air quality monitoring. The information potentially obtained from the Chappuis ozone band is significant and essentially unique - no other passive technique can provide comparable information on near-surface ozone. However, it has remained a challenge to demonstrate the potential benefits with real measurements. We report our progress on a technique to combine use of UV and visible spectra from the Chappuis ozone band to enhance the sensitivity of the retrievals to near-surface ozone, and evaluate its potential with regard to both existing and future satellite instruments.",

            "abstract": "Despite the large impact of cirrus clouds on the Earth’s climate system, their effects are still only poorly understood. Our knowledge of the climate effect of cirrus clouds is mainly based on theoretical simulations using idealized cloud structure and microphysics, as well as radiative transfer approximations. To improve the representation of cirrus clouds in idealized simulations and circulation models, we need a better understanding of the micro- and macrophysical properties of cirrus clouds. Airborne lidar measurements provide two-dimensional information of the atmospheric structure, and are thus a suitable tool to study the fine-structure of cirrus clouds, as well as their macrophysical properties. Aerosol and water vapor was measured with the airborne high spectral resolution lidar (HSRL) and differential absorption lidar (DIAL) system WALES of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), Oberpfaffenhofen. The system was operated onboard the German high altitude and long range research aircraft HALO during the Next-generation remote sensing for validation studies campaign (NARVAL) in December 2013 over the tropical North-Atlantic and in January 2014 out of Iceland, and during the ML-Cirrus campaign in March/April 2014 over Central and Southern Europe. During NARVAL 18 flights with more than 110 flight hours were performed providing a large number of cirrus cloud overpasses with combined lidar and radar instrumentation. In the framework of the ML-Cirrus campaign 17 flights with more than 80 flight hours were performed to characterize cirrus cloud properties in different environmental conditions using a combination of remote sensing (e.g. lidar) and in-situ observations. In our presentation we will give a general overview of the campaigns and of the WALES measurements. We will show first results from the aerosol and water vapor lidar measurements with focus on the structure of cirrus clouds, the humidity distribution within and outside the cloud and on the impact of the stage of evolution on the cirrus cloud properties.",

            "abstract": "In a probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA) framework, it still remains a challenge to adjust ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) for application in different seismological environments. In this context, this study presents a complete framework for the development of a response spectral GMPE easily adjustable to different seismological conditions; and which does not suffer from the technical problems associated with the adjustment in response spectral domain. Essentially, the approach consists of an empirical FAS (Fourier Amplitude Spectrum) model and a duration model for ground motion which are combined within the random vibration theory (RVT) framework to obtain the full response spectral ordinates. Additionally, FAS corresponding to individual acceleration records are extrapolated beyond the frequency range defined by the data using the stochastic FAS model, obtained by inversion as described in Edwards & Faeh, (2013). To that end, an empirical model for a duration, which is tuned to optimize the fit between RVT based and observed response spectral ordinate, at each oscillator frequency is derived. Although, the main motive of the presented approach was to address the adjustability issues of response spectral GMPEs; comparison, of median predicted response spectra with the other regional models indicate that presented approach can also be used as a stand-alone model. Besides that, a significantly lower aleatory variability (σ<0.5 in log units) in comparison to other regional models, at shorter periods brands it to a potentially viable alternative to the classical regression (on response spectral ordinates) based GMPEs for seismic hazard studies in the near future. The dataset used for the presented analysis is a subset of the recently compiled database RESORCE-2012 across Europe, Middle East and the Mediterranean region.",

            "abstract": "In many countries thermal springs are utilized for a variety of purposes, such as the generation of power, direct space heating, industrial processes, aquaculture and many more. The optimal use of a thermal spring is largely dependent upon its physical and chemical characteristics. The physical and chemical parameters of groundwater play a significant role in classifying and assessing water quality. Major ions constitute the most significant part of the total dissolved solids present in the groundwater and the concentration of these ions in ground water depends mainly on the hydro chemical processes that place in the aquifer system.\nThis article focuses on the thermal and chemical features of 21 thermal springs located in the overall of the Turkey. Field data and water samples were collected for analysis of physical and chemical parameters. Thermal springs and thermal wells have temperatures ranging from 35 to 95°C. The pH values of the thermal waters change between 6.3 and 9.6. A Piper trilinear diagram and Schoeller diagram show that all the thermal waters are characterized by the dominance of anion-cation. Thermal waters display various chemical compositions and high temperature waters have Na-SO4, Na-HCO3, Na-Cl, Ca-SO4, Ca-HCO3 type. The springs are associated with faults and impermeable dykes and are assumed to be of meteoric origin. The mineral composition of the thermal waters reflects the geological formations found at the depth of origin.\nAll thermal water springs are suitable for use in terms balneology since they contain high levels of mineral content and temperature. At the same time, some samples can be consumed by humans as soda water and mineral water. However, it is important to keep such limitations in mind when determining the ultimate use of the thermal springs.",

            "abstract": "The global biogeochemical cycling of silicon (Si) is intrinsically linked to the fate of CO2 in the earth’s atmosphere. To date, most research has focused on the oceanic cycling of Si over glacial/interglacial timescales although, the importance of continental Si cycling (via abiotic and biotic processes) is now being addressed. Especially as the significant potential for Si sequestration in continental lake systems has been recently highlighted [1].\nWe present the first large-scale silicon isotope (δ30SiDSi) profiles of Lake Baikal’s water column, where a comparison between both pre- and post-diatom growing season δ30SiDSi signatures are made. Samples were collected along a water profile (surface to 180 m) at numerous sites across Lake Baikal, with deep-water endmembers at 400 m and c. 1,500 m. All isotopic analyses were conducted on a Neptune + Multi-Collector ICP-MS at NIGL, UK, using wet plasma mode with Mg doping of samples and standard-sample-standard bracketing. Analytical reproducibility is 0.12‰ (2σ) and blanks are <1% of signal intensity.\nDSi concentrations of March water surface samples (South Basin only) range between c. 0.74 and 1.23 ppm while those collected in August are all <0.70 ppm, following seasonal biological utilisation. In turn Chlorophyll a values from South Basin profiles in August are greater (between c. 1.46 to 3.18 mg l-1) than March surface values (<0.70 mg l-1). Indeed, March δ30SiDSi surface values range between c. +2.16 and +2.45‰ while summer surface values range between c. +2.20 and +2.84‰, reflecting residual pool depletion after summer biological utilisation. δ30SiDSi values are >1‰ more enriched than dominant lake water inflows again reflecting diatom Si uptake. Annual open sediment traps deployed down Lake Baikal’s water column yield δ30Sidiatom signatures of +1.25‰, which suggests that down-column diatom dissolution is minimal. Applying the diatom fractionation factor of -1.1‰[2] and adopting a closed system model approach, these data are applied to mass balance diatom utilisation in Lake Baikal.\n[1]Frings at al, 2014.

            "abstract": "As an effect of climate change, temperatures in high latitude regions are increasing faster than in the rest of the world and future projections indicate it will increase between 7°C and 8°C by the end of the 21st century. Permafrost soils store around 1700 Pg of Carbon (C), which is approximately the amount of C stored in terrestrial vegetation and in the atmosphere combined. Sustained warming induces permafrost thaw, leads to a thicker seasonal active layer, and creates subsided patches in the landscape. Carbon that was previously inaccessible to decomposition is thus exposed, increasing the likelihood of positive feedback of CO2 to the atmosphere. We measured C fluxes (Net ecosystem carbon flux, NEE, and Ecosystem respiration, Re) using the eddy covariance approach in a tundra landscape (Eight Mile Lake Watershed, Alaska) undergoing permafrost degradation from the beginning of the growing season in 2008 and throughout most winters until May 2014. This interval encompassed a range of climatic variability that included a deviation of ± 50% from the long term average in growing season precipitation. Active layer depth (thaw depth at the end of the growing season) and subsidence in the footprint were used as indicators of permafrost degradation. Results indicate that annual NEE ranged from a sink of 0.76 MgC ha-1 yr-1 to a source of 0.55 MgC ha-1 yr-1. NEE during the growing seasons fluctuated from 1.1 to 1.8 MgC ha-1 season-1 in net C uptake. Annual NEE was strongly affected by winter Re, which represented between 33% and 45% of the annual value regardless of of the large drop in both air and soil temperature. Parameters from the light response curve (optimum NEE, NEEopt and quantum yield, α) showed a seasonal and interannual variability and were different between the most and least degraded sites in the footprint, which affected the magnitude of the carbon cycle and may have implications for landscape C balance in sub-arctic tundra.",

            "abstract": "Multiple parameters controlling subgrid-scale physical processes in the version 3 of the Hadley Centre Atmosphere Model (HadAM3) were optimized to global mean outgoing longwave radiation and reflected shortwave radiation estimates from CERES and ERBE satellite observations. An ensemble of sucessfully-optimized model configurations were identified. Equilibrium climate sensitivity of each model configuration was estimated using a statistical emulator, which had been trained on a 14,001-member ensemble of HadAM3 slab-ocean experiment simulated over the distributed computing platform of climateprediction.net. To produce an uncertainty estimate for the equilibrium climate sensitivity, likelihood for each model configuration was calculated by combining model-observational discrepancy arising from satellite measurements, observational radiation imbalance, total solar irradiance, radiative forcing, natural aerosol, internal climate variability, and the prescribed sea-surface temperature and that arising from parameters that were not varied. Combining different prior probabilities for model configurations with the likelihood for each configuration and taking account of uncertainty in the emulated climate sensitivity gives, for the HadAM3 model, a 2.5%-97.5% range for climate sensitivity of 2.7-4.2 K if the CERES observations are correct. If the ERBE observations are correct, then they suggest a larger range, for HadAM3, of 2.7-5.6 K. Amplifying the CERES observational error estimate by a factor of 20 brings CERES and ERBE estimates into agreement. In this case the climate sensitivity range is 2.7-5.4 K. The results rule out, at the 2.5% level for HadAM3 and several different prior assumptions, climate sensitivity greater than 5.6 K.",

            "abstract": "Portugal lies close to the Eurasian-African boundary, a region of tectonic regime transition from convergence in the Mediterranean to strike-slip in the Atlantic. Such broad convergence area, characterized by a slow rate of about 4.5–5.6 mm/yr, translates unto a scattered seismicity concentrated mainly in the offshore. Therefore, the irregular source-receiver geometry resulting from the inland seismic stations networks does not permit to derive high-resolution models of the Portuguese crustal structure using traditional passive seismology. Seismic interferometry/ambient noise surface-waves tomography allows imaging regions with a resolution that mainly depends on the seismic network coverage.\nOver the last decade, both Portuguese and Spanish permanent broadband (BB) seismic networks expanded significantly. This densification enabled to build a detailed image of the crustal structure of the Iberian Peninsula using ambient seismic noise. However, due to the existing network gaps towards west, the crustal image of Western Iberia is on the limit of resolution. The two years temporary deployment by the WILAS project contributed to fill those gaps and provide an excellent opportunity to study the Portuguese crustal structure.\nDispersion measurements were computed for each pair of stations using empirical Green’s functions generated by cross-correlating one-day-length seismic ambient-noise records. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the empirical Green functions computed from ambient noise records, we applied a phase cross-correlation method, followed by time-frequency domain phase weighted stack.\nGroup-velocities were computed using the S-transform and we use the Fast Marching Surface Tomography algoritm to compute group velocity perturbation maps. Group velocities were then inverted as a function of depth to obtain S-wave velocity maps for diferent depths.\nThe models will be compared with results from Ps receiver functions. The results obtained for the crust using both methods are consistent.\nThis work was supported by FCT projects WILAS (PTDC/CTE-GIX/097946/2008) and AQUAREL (PTDC/CTE-GIX/116819/2010) and is a contribution to project QuakeLoc-PT (PTDC/GEO-FIQ/3522/2012) and PEST-OE/CTE/LA-0019/2013-2014.",

            "abstract": "Light absorbing carbonaceous aerosols are known to be an important climatic driver with a global radiative forcing of about half (IPCC, 2013) to two-thirds (Bond et al., 2013) that of the dominant greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide. While the mass absorption coefficient of pure black carbon (BC) is fairly well known, observational evidence suggests that BC rapidly mixes with other aerosol chemical components within hours of emission (Moffet and Prather, 2009; Moteki et al., 2007). These other components may include predominantly scattering organic, sulfate, and nitrate species, as well as light-absorbing, so-called “brown carbon” (BrC). It has been suggested that the presence of these BC-mixed components may induce mixing-state-dependent lensing effects that could potentially double the BC direct radiative forcing (Jacobson, 2001). The key to better understanding how BC-rich aerosols are distributed in the atmosphere is to examine an unbiased set of measurements covering broad spatial and temporal coverage; however, many past airborne field campaigns have specifically targeted source plumes or other scientifically-relevant emissions sources. The recent NASA DISCOVER-AQ campaign is unique in that approximately the same flight pattern was performed over a month-long period in each of four different U.S. metropolitan areas, ensuring an unbiased, or at least less biased, data set with both wide horizontal and vertical (surface to 5 km altitude) coverage.\nWe present a statistical analysis of BC-rich particle mixing state measured during DISCOVER-AQ by a DMT Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2). The SP2 measures the BC mass distribution via laser incandescence, and the non-BC coating thickness is inferred from the light scattering signal of particles greater than 200 nm in diameter (Gao et al., 2007; Moteki and Kondo, 2008). The SP2-derived size distributions are compared to optical scattering size distributions measured by an UHSAS in order determine 1) the externally mixed fraction of particles containing BC across the optically-active region of the size distribution (200-1000 nm) and 2) the internally mixed volume fraction of BC relative to the total particle volume assuming spherical particles. Vertical profiles of these variables are discussed in the context of remotely sensing aerosol mixing state.",

            "abstract": "Google Streetview is a feature of Google Maps and Google Earth that allows viewers to switch from map or satellite view to 360° panoramic imagery recorded close to the ground. Most panoramas are recorded by Google engineers using special cameras mounted on the roofs of cars. Bicycles, snowmobiles, and boats have also been used and sometimes the camera has been mounted on a backpack for off-road use by hikers and skiers or attached to scuba-diving gear for “Underwater Streetview (sic).” Streetview panoramas are linked together so that the viewer can change viewpoint by clicking forward and reverse buttons. They therefore create a 4-D touring effect.\nAs part of the GEODE project (“Google Earth for Onsite and Distance Education”), we are experimenting with the use of Streetview imagery for geoscience education. Our web-based test application allows instructors to select locations for students to study. Students are presented with a set of questions or tasks that they must address by studying the panoramic imagery. Questions include identification of rock types, structures such as faults, and general geological setting. The student view is locked into Streetview mode until they submit their answers, whereupon the map and satellite views become available, allowing students to zoom out and verify their location on Earth. Student learning is scaffolded by automatic computerized feedback.\nThere are lots of existing Streetview panoramas with rich geological content. Additionally, instructors and members of the general public can create panoramas, including 360° Photo Spheres, by stitching images taken with their mobiles devices and submitting them to Google for evaluation and hosting. A multi-thousand-dollar, multi-directional camera and mount can be purchased from DIY-streetview.com. This allows power users to generate their own high-resolution panoramas. A cheaper, 360° video camera is soon to be released according to geonaute.com. Thus there are opportunities for geoscience educators both to use existing Streetview imagery and to generate new imagery for specific locations of geological interest.\nThe GEODE team includes the authors and: H.

            "abstract": "The terrestrial hydrological cycle comprises complex processes in the subsurface, land surface, and atmosphere, which are connected via complex non-linear feedback mechanisms. The influence of subsurface hydrodynamics on land surface mass and energy fluxes has been the subject of previous studies. Several studies have also investigated the soil moisture-precipitation feedback, neglecting however the connection with groundwater dynamics. The objective of this study is to examine the impact of subsurface hydrodynamics on convective precipitation events via shallow soil moisture and land surface processes. A scale-consistent Terrestrial System Modeling Platform (TerrSysMP) that consists of an atmospheric model (COSMO), a land surface model (CLM), and a three-dimensional variably saturated groundwater-surface water flow model (ParFlow), is used to simulate hourly mass and energy fluxes over days with convective rainfall events over the Rur catchment, Germany. In order to isolate the effect of groundwater dynamics on convective precipitation, two different model configurations with identical initial conditions are considered. The first configuration allows the groundwater table to evolve through time, while a spatially distributed, temporally constant groundwater table is prescribed as a lower boundary condition in the second configuration. The simulation results suggest that groundwater dynamics influence land surface soil moisture, which in turn affects the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) height by modifying atmospheric thermals. It is demonstrated that because of this sensitivity of ABL height to soil moisture-temperature feedback, the onset and magnitude of convective precipitation is influenced by subsurface hydrodynamics. Thus, the results provide insight into the soil moisture-precipitation feedback including groundwater dynamics in a physically consistent manner by closing the water cycle from aquifers to the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Spatio-temporal variability of East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) precipitation on millennial timescale during the Holocene is of major interest to climatologists. Recent studies on the variability of EASM precipitation during the Holocene focus on its high resolution reconstruction using stalagmite’s δ18O record. However, stalagmite’s δ18O does not necessarily reflect EASM precipitation intensity and information on spatial precipitation pattern is difficult to obtain.\nYangtze River drainage occupies major part of South China and lies oblique to EASM front direction. Consequently, when EASM front penetrated deep(shallow) into China, more precipitation occurred in the upper(lower) reaches. Because over 96% of the sediment discharge from Yangtze is transported as suspension, it is possible to estimate relative contribution of precipitation between the lower and upper reaches from the provenance of suspended particles.\nHere we use ESR intensity of quartz in fine silt fraction from Yangtze River Delta core to detect changes in heavy precipitation area within Yangtze River drainage. ESR intensity reflects the average age of source rocks. Since Mesozoic rocks are widely exposed in the upper reaches whereas Proterozoic rocks are exposed in the lower reaches, it is possible to detect relative contribution of suspended sediments from the upper vs. lower reaches. Our study on ESR intensity on modern Yangtze River sediments suggests that we can distinguish the suspended sediments from the upper vs. lower reaches, and that their mixing ratio reflects the relative ratio of the water from the two areas. We will present the result and demonstrate its implication.",

            "abstract": "Empirical probability density functions (PDFs) of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) have been derived from spacecraft data since the early years of the space age. A survey of the literature shows that past studies have investigated the separate Cartesian components of the magnetic field, the vector magnitude, and the direction of the IMF by means of one-dimensional or two-dimensional PDFs. But, to my knowledge, there exist no studies which investigate the three dimensional nature of the IMF by means of three dimensional PDFs, either in\n(\nB\nx\n,\nB\ny\n,\nB\nz\n)\n-coordinates or\n(\nB\nR\n,\nB\nT\n,\nB\nN\n)\n-coordinates or some other appropriate system of coordinates. Likewise, there exist no studies which investigate three dimensional PDFs of magnetic field fluctuations, that is, vector differences\n\\bmB(t+τ)−\\bmB(t)\n. In this talk, I shall present examples of three dimensional PDFs obtained from spacecraft data that demonstrate the solar wind magnetic field possesses a very interesting spatial structure that, to my knowledge, has not previously been identified. Perhaps because of the well known model of Barnes (1981) in which the magnitude of the IMF remains constant, it may be commonly believed that there is nothing new to learn from a full three dimensional PDF. To the contrary, there is much to learn from the investigation of three dimensional PDFs of the solar wind plasma velocity and the magnetic field, as well as three dimensional PDFs of their fluctuations. Knowledge of these PDFs will not only improve understanding of solar wind physics, it is an essential prerequisite for the construction of realistic models of the stochastic time series measured by a single spacecraft, one of the longstanding goals of space physics research. In addition, three dimensional PDFs contain valuable information about the anisotropy of solar wind fluctuations in three dimensional physical space, information that may help identify the reason why the three dimensional wave vector spectrum of magnetic field fluctuations in the solar wind is not axisymmetric about the direction of the mean magnetic field as recent observations in the ecliptic plane at 1 AU have shown.",

            "abstract": "Climate extremes have resulted in widespread reductions in mean ecosystem productivity, and therefore attracted a lot of studies. Using global satellite and climate products (2000-2011), this study shows that the early 21st century is water-limited for global biomes, i.e. productivity is proportional to water availability irrespective of dry or wet climate regimes. Cross-biome water-use efficiency is convergent to a single value for all of the driest, wettest and mean climate regimes in this period. No change in WUE along aridity gradient was found at cross-biome levels. Climatic variability generally tends to decrease mean NPP (net primary productivity) but increases NPP variability; however, climatic variability and extremes may affect ecosystem functioning in different and even contrasting ways for different biomes. Impact of dry extremes on reductions in vegetation productivity dominates over effects of wet extremes on productivity increases in the early 21st century. Future projections of climate forcing and ecosystem response should move beyond evaluation of “mean” behavior, and towards “variability” and “extremes”.",

Mass selected H+ and He2+ pulsed ion beams were used to simulate the solar wind impacting an Apollo 17 breccia powered sample. A low energy ion, 0.1 to 5 keV, impacting a surface loses energy by ionization, secondary electron emission, excitation, and kinetic/potential sputtering. When the straggling of these low energy ions becomes comparable to the penetration depth, the result is backscattering of ions and ENAs.

            "abstract": "Sunspot with umbrae of opposite polarity within a single common penumbra are called δ-spot group (Kunzel, 1960). It has been well known that major flares almost always occur in active region with δ-configuration. Hence, to investigate the formation and evolution of δ-configuration is a key in understanding the major flare activities. However, for the case of δ-spot, emerging flux regions (EFRs) combine intricately to each other. Therefore it is so difficult to decipher the relations between multiple EFRs. To clearly follow the development of the ARs, we should select the ARs which can be observed from the initial emerging stage.\nEmergence and magnetic evolution of solar active regions (ARs) of βγδ-type, which are known to be highly flare active (Sammis 2000), were studied with the SOHO/MDI data in the solar cycle 23. 31 ARs, which can be seen from the birth phase, were selected as unbiased samples of our study.\nFrom our analysis, we found that successive birth of two emerging flux regions, spatially separated to each other in east-west direction as a series, forming a quadrupolar magnetic configuration, is a typical way of initial development of βγδ regions. The δ-configuration was formed by following polarity of western EFR with preceding polarity of eastern EFR.\nWe found 11ARs of quadrupolar type among the sampled 31 ARs.\nIn this work, we propose a plausible model for the quadrupolar type δ-spots as a simple magnetic tube of helical structure, which have downward knot in the mid portion of the flux tube. In nine cases out of 11, the characteristics of the magnetic helicity signs, i.e. the signs of twist and writhe, are consistent with our model.",

            "abstract": "Variations in evapotranspiration (ET) have been well documented across a variety of forest types and climates in recent decades; however, most of these data have focused on mature, second-growth stands. Here we present data on two important fluxes of water, canopy interception (Ic) and forest floor litter interception (Iff), across a chronosequence of forest age classes in the southern Appalachian Mountains. We used climate stations and throughfall collectors to measure gross rainfall and estimate Ic at each site and used a non-linear mixed model to determine the effects of forest age and precipitation on stand Ic. We also collected forest floor biomass monthly at each site and used these data in a model of litter wetting and drying to determine the quantity of water lost to Iff. Precipitation varied from 1690 to 2002 mm yr-1 across sites and across years (2011–2013). Canopy interception increased rapidly as forests aged to a maximum of 190 mm yr-1 in an 85 yr old forest. Despite higher leaf area in older stands, forest floor biomass did not vary significantly among sites (p = 0.47), suggesting lower decomposition rates in younger sites or effects of residual material from logging activity. At all sites, Iff accounted for 88-104 mm year-1 of total ET. Unlike Ic, modeled estimates of interannual variation in Iff were insensitive to annual rainfall amount and were dependent primarily on forest floor biomass. Additional measurements are currently underway to validate the litter interception model using litter moisture probes and forest floor wet and dry weights. Improved estimates of interception will contribute to our understanding of how forest structure and climate variability affect forest water use and help improve models of rainfall partitioning across the broader matrix of forest age classes.",

            "abstract": "An important premise for reconstructing environmental changes using sediment records is to understand which environmental information reaches the lake bottom and how diagenetic processes may affect the proxies, such as terrestrial and aquatic organic biomarkers. We can tackle this question using a unique series of varved sediment cores collected from the lake Nylandssjön (northern Sweden). In addition to limnological and sediment trap sampling since 2001, we have a collection of freeze cores taken in late winter and stored since 1979, which allows us to track individual varve years (e.g., 1978) over time (~30 years). A previous study using this collection showed that 23 % of C and 35 % of N were lost during the first 25 years with a C:N ratio increase of ≈21, suggesting important implications for diagenetic effects on organic biomarkers.\nTo assess the preservation/transformation of organic biomarkers, we developed a new Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry method that allows the rapid determination of biomarkers from the common OM classes (e.g., plant waxes, microbial lipids, lignins) using sub-mg sample sizes and thus applicable to high-resolution sampling of the varved sediment (Tolu et al., under review).\nOur results show that the different biomarkers exhibit a broad spectrum of reactivities over ~30 years -% change determined by ([Peak area at t] – [Peak area at t=0])/ [peak area at t=0] x 100-. For example: 67-80 % of the algal chlorophyll-derived product ‘phytene’ is lost depending which single varve year is followed over time (e.g., 1979). Only 12-32 % of “pristene”, the degraded form of algal chlorophyll, is lost. The guaiacyl and syringyl lignin units are affected by a smaller loss, i.e. 5-15 %, and the S/G ratio, indicative of angiosperm/gymnosperm plant input remains stable, which is contrary to previous work on non-varved lake sediments. Considering all biomarkers, the degradation/production plateaued after ~15 years, which indicates that reconstructions of changes in OM quality sedimentation can be safely done from the 15th varve without further significant changes induced by diagenesis. To reconstruct changes in OM quality within the recent 15 years, the stable biomarkers and the degradation rates of the non-stable ones have to be used. 1 Gälman et al.

            "abstract": "Conventional radiosonde observations (RAOBs), along with satellite and other in situ data, are assimilated in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models to generate a forecast. Radiosonde temperature observations, however, have solar and thermal radiation induced biases (typically a warm daytime bias from sunlight heating the sensor and a cold bias at night as the sensor emits longwave radiation). Radiation corrections made at stations based on algorithms provided by radiosonde manufacturers or national meteorological agencies may not be adequate, so biases remain. To adjust these biases, NWP centers may make additional adjustments to radiosonde data. However, the radiation correction (RADCOR) schemes used in the NOAA NCEP data assimilation and forecasting system is outdated and does not cover several widely-used contemporary radiosonde types. This study focuses on work whose objective is to improve these corrections and test their impacts on the NWP forecasting and analysis.\nGPS Radio Occultation (RO) dry temperature (Tdry) is considered to be highly accurate in the upper troposphere and low stratosphere where atmospheric water vapor is negligible. This study uses GPS RO Tdry from the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) as the reference to quantify the radiation induced RAOB temperature errors by analyzing ~ 3-yr collocated RAOB and COSMIC GPS RO data compile by the NOAA Products Validation System (NPROVS). The new radiation adjustments are developed for different solar angle categories and for all common sonde types flown in the WMO global operational upper air network.\nResults for global and several commonly used sondes are presented in the context of NCEP Global Forecast System observation-minus-background analysis, indicating projected impacts in reducing forecast error. Dedicated NWP impact studies to quantify the impact of the new RADCOR schemes on the NCEP analyses and forecast are under consideration.",

            "abstract": "Because of the lack of data and the complexity of the patterns observed by speleologists, karst network modeling is a challenge. In this work, we study topological and geometrical properties of large karst networks trough spatial graph models. A statistical mechanics approach is used to explore the set of directed and (possibly) weighted spatial graphs on a given space to extract subset of graphs of given properties. Within this framework, it's possible to generate sets of karst networks having realistic properties (in terms of spatial extension, degree distribution of nodes, number of cycles, total available volume for water transport, ...) and passing trough a given set of fixed points (for example some known inlets and outlets).\nSpatial graph analogues of the traditional statistical ensembles are defined (the microcanonical, canonical and grand canonical ensembles).\nWe show how choice of (pseudo) Hamiltonians and ensemble parameters influence the structure of typical generated graphs (tree graphs, many loops graphs, hight clustering coefficient graphs, small total length graphs, ...). Two kind of Hamiltonians are studied: - the structural ones, $i.e.$ Hamiltonians which are functions of the topology and the geometrical properties of the graph and - Hamiltonians related to the dynamical process occurring on the graph. An important dynamics related Hamiltonian is the measure of the total dissipated energy by groundwater flow trough the karst network.\nAn ensemble of special interest is the grand canonical ensemble in which the number of nodes (excepted the given set outlets and inlets) and the number of edges are not imposed. This ensemble is useful to investigate how a network can emerge on a prescribed space. We give an interpretation to the parameters defining this ensemble, show some realisations, and discuss the interest of this ensemble for karst generation.",

            "abstract": "Satellite observations are a cost effective tool for monitoring large numbers of volcanoes in areas with scarce instrumentation or difficult access. In the context of the 2012 Santorini Report on satellite Earth Observation and Geohazards, CEOS (Committee on Earth Observation Satellites) has developed a pilot project to showcase remote sensing for volcano hazard mitigation and response. Specifically, the pilot aims to demonstrate the feasibility of global volcano monitoring of Holocene volcanoes by undertaking regional monitoring of volcanic arcs in Latin America, using satellite earth observations data to track deformation as well as gas, ash, and thermal emissions. Latin America was chosen because the volcanoes are situated in a diversity of environments, providing a good test of the capabilities of different types of satellite data under different conditions; volcanic activity is abundant, and monitoring agencies in Latin American countries would directly benefit from the resources that this pilot will make available. It is hoped that the regional study will demonstrate that Earth observation data can help to identify volcanoes that may become active in the future as well as track eruptive activity that may impact populations and infrastructure on the ground and in the air, ultimately leading to improved targeting for permanent satellite-based observations and in-situ volcanic monitoring efforts. The pilot project is posible thanks to data provided by the various space agencies (ESA, ASI, DLR, JAXA, NASA, CNES, CSA).\nIn this contribution, we focus on premilinary ground deformation results using SAR satellites for selected areas in the Northern and Southern Andes as well as the Caribbean with recent unrest. For example, in the Southern Andes we will present ALOS time series at Llaima (-38.7 S) and Peteroa (-35.2 S) volcanoes, both of which have had eruptions during the past ten years.",

The campaign spanned 4 years and took place over four geographically different locations. These included, Washington DC/Baltimore, MD (July 2011), San Joaquin Valley, CA (January – February 2013), Houston, TX (September 2013), and Denver, CO (July-August 2014). With the objective of obtaining better CO2 column calculations, each of these campaigns consisted of missed approaches and approximately two hundred vertical soundings of CO2 (from the surface to about 5 km). In this study, surface and column-averaged CO2 mixing ratio values from the vertical soundings in the four different urban areas are used to examine the temporal and spatial variability of CO2 within the lower troposphere. Tracers such as CO, CH2O, NOx, and NMHCs will be used to identify the source of variations observed in these urban sites. Additionally, we apply nominal CO2 column weighting functions for potential future active remote CO2 sensors operating in the 1.57-mm and 2.05-mm measurement regions to convert the in situ CO2 vertical mixing ratio profiles to variations in CO2 column optical depths, which is what the active remote sensors actually measure. Using statistics calculated from the optical depths at each urban site measured during the DISCOVER-AQ field campaign and for each nominal weighting function, we compare the natural variability of CO2 columns in the lower troposphere; relate the CO2 column variability to surface emissions; and show the measurement requirements for the future ASCENDS (Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons) in the continental U.S. urban areas.",

            "abstract": "The storm surge caused by Hurricane Sandy triggered a need for new research on surge inundation and associated risk. However, observational records of coastal water levels are limited, which increases uncertainty in risk analysis. Global climate models provide a means of simulating a much larger sample of potential surge-producing events, allowing for better resolution of the tail of the frequency distribution. The resolution of current climate models may be sufficient to simulate the structure and intensity of extratropical cyclones. Since 17 of the 20 greatest storm surge events at The Battery in New York City occurred in association with extratropical cyclones, we examine the ability of a coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model with 50 km atmospheric resolution (the GFDL CM2.5 model) to realistically simulate extratropical cyclones in the western North Atlantic Ocean that are capable of producing large storm surges. We analyze the similarities between CM2.5 and reanalysis products, including NASA’s MERRA (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications). After considering differences in spatial and temporal resolution, preliminary analyses suggest that indicators of cyclone strength in CM2.5 and MERRA are comparable. We also investigate a simple screening method based on wind speed and direction to identify potential surge-producing events in CM2.5 for determining a subset of events for more detailed analysis.",

Another dataset available is the HC27 (Harvest Choice by IFPRI) in a gridded format (10km) but composed of generic soil profiles based on only three criteria (texture, rooting depth, and organic carbon content). In this paper, we present a development and application of a high-resolution (1km), gridded soil database for regional crop modeling in East Africa. Basic soil information is extracted from Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS), which provides essential soil properties (bulk density, soil organic carbon, soil PH and percentages of sand, silt and clay) for 6 different standardized soil layers (5, 15, 30, 60, 100 and 200 cm) in 1km resolution. Soil hydraulic properties (e.g., field capacity and wilting point) are derived from the AfSIS soil dataset using well-proven pedo-transfer functions and are customized for DSSAT-CSM soil data requirements. The crop model is used to evaluate crop yield forecasts using the new high resolution soil database and compared with WISE and HC27. In this paper we will present also the results of DSSAT loosely coupled with a hydrologic model (VIC) to assimilate root-zone soil moisture. Creating a grid-based soil database, which provides a consistent soil input for two different models (DSSAT and VIC) is a critical part of this work. The created soil database is expected to contribute to future applications of DSSAT crop simulation in East Africa where food security is highly vulnerable.",

            "abstract": "During the 2007-2009 solar quiet period there existed a unique opportunity to study the synoptic variability of the open-closed boundary (OCB) using data provided by fluxgate magnetometers located at South Pole, McMurdo, and from a network of Automatic Geophysical Observatories distributed across the Antarctic continent. In Urban et al [2011], this synoptic variability was analyzed during a geomagnetic quiet period of early August 2008 and excellent (>83%) agreement was found between the experimental observations and the BATSRUS space weather model. In this paper we discuss the OCB's synoptic behavior under the forcing of a geomagnetic storm driven by a corotating interaction region and again compare these results to predictions made with different versions of BATSRUS model runs. Strictly adhering to the method developed in Urban et al [2011], we show only weak agreement between the experimental data and model during this geomagnetically-active time, independent of the model resolution and the incorporation of the Rice Convection Model. Given that a potential source of disagreement could be from the rigidity of the original open/closed field line determination technique itself (developed for geomagnetic quiescence), we adapt the technique to variations in local time and geomagnetic activity; any remaining discrepancies between the data and the model are investigated with DMSP spacecraft-determined boundary data.",

            "abstract": "Ice core records from Antarctica have shown promise as highly-resolved indicators of regional sea ice change, but to date semi-quantified reconstructions do not extend back more than ~150 years. In this study the chemical composition of the James Ross Island ice core is presented as a potential sea ice proxy record spanning the full Holocene and into the last glacial interval. A CFA-TE method was used to analyse the chemical composition of the entire 363.9m core including final 5m which contains evidence of glacial age ice. MSA- and major anions were measured at 4cm effective resolution, along with trace elements Na, Ca, K, Mg, Mn, H2O2, NO3, total conductivity and dust at <0.5cm effective resolution. Seasonal signals from H2O2 in the upper 50m of the core support the use of non sea salt-SO42- for determining seasonality in deeper sections. This multi-proxy analysis of the oldest ice core to date from the Antarctic Peninsula region allows the concurrent interpretation of sea ice changes and their environmental drivers. The potential dual influence of previous winter sea ice extent and air pathway source region on MSA concentrations in the core are interpreted with use of Na as a winter maximum indicator and Ca and dust signal strength showing changes in dust flux indicating potential source region variation.",

            "abstract": "The Mini-RF instrument aboard NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) is currently acquiring bistatic radar data of the lunar surface in an effort to understand the scattering properties of lunar terrains as a function of bistatic angle. As part of the Mini-RF bistatic observation campaign, Circular Polarization Ratio (CPR) information for a variety lunar terrains is being collected. The crater Kepler, and the mare deposits that surround it, offer an example of what this information can tell us about the phase angle response of lunar materials at the transmitted wavelength of the radar (12.6 cm). Data for this particular region has been acquired on multiple occasions and cover a bistatic angle range of 0° to 22°. Isolating the response of Kepler’s ejecta blanket from the surrounding mare deposits, it is clear that the mare deposits have an nearly uniform CPR for bistatic angles < ~17° while materials associated with the ejecta blanket show a steady and significant increase in CPR for bistatic angles < ~5° (i.e., an opposition effect). The difference in the response of these two terrains is likely related the size and distribution of radar scatterers in the ejecta blanket of Kepler crater. Bistatic data for the south polar crater Cabeus has been acquired on four occasions and these data cover a bistatic angle range of 0° to 18°. When viewed at near zero degrees, the floor of Cabeus crater shows an enhancement in CPR with respect to surrounding materials. This is not apparent in data acquired of Cabeus crater when Mini-RF operated in a monostatic mode. Further, when viewed at phase angles of several degrees, the floor of Cabeus crater shows a suppression of CPR with respect to surrounding materials. This scattering behavior clearly indicates an opposition effect but the response is markedly different from that observed for Kepler crater. We propose that the scattering behavior of materials on the floor of Cabeus crater are consistent with the presence of water ice and that the difference in the scattering behavior observed with a monostatic architecture is related to the grazing incidence (~85°) at which the region is viewed by Mini-RF when operating in a bistatic mode (i.e, the water ice observed is confined to a relatively thin layer, near the surface).",

To address this question, the NASA P-3B systematically conducted vertical profiles over at least six ground sites sampling down to about 1000 feet over ground level. This data is combined with missed approaches at local airports which provide vertically resolved information between the lowest spiral altitude and the ground-based measurements. During the last two DISCOVER-AQ field deployments (Houston September 2013 and Colorado (July-August 2014), NASA Langley had aerosol measurements both onboard the NASA P-3B and in a mobile laboratory. Coincident measurements included aerosol number concentration, size distributions, along with optical properties such as aerosol scattering, extinction, and hygroscopicity. We present a comparison between the airborne and ground-based measurements made in two very different environments. The Houston area had much higher aerosol concentrations we sampled a variety of airmasses, from clean marine-air to emissions from the local refineries. In Colorado, most of the sampling was done in low aerosol concentration environments, away from local sources. Combined, the two field experiments provide at least 60 comparisons between airborne and ground-based aerosol measurements.",

            "abstract": "While the impact of rapid (i.e. sub-daily) fluctuations in climatic forcing on short-term fluctuations in water and carbon fluxes is rarely disputed, their aggregate effect on long-term fluxes and stores of carbon and water continues to be the subject of active research.\nA process based ecohydrological model was used to unfold the effect of short time scale variability in precipitation, temperature and radiation on the water and carbon cycles across different climatic regimes and biomes worldwide. Specifically, synthetic climate inputs are first generated with prescribed statistical properties, modifying the small scale structure of each of the investigated forcing variable to evaluate its impact on ecosystem fluxes and stores at all temporal scales. The key statistical properties investigated here include: precipitation extremes, correlation structure, intermittency and its inter- and intra-storm structure; temperature distribution and correlation; and radiation distribution and their correlation structure. A statistical analysis and mechanistic explanations of how climate variability at short temporal scales affects evapotranspiration (ET) and its two components, net and gross primary productivity and vegetation dynamics at a wide range of temporal scales spanning from hourly to inter-annual is provided.\nThe main result is that short-lived excursions in climate forcings play a major role in controlling water, energy and carbon fluxes at all temporal scales. This finding is supported by the fact that nonlinearities describing the pathways by which climate variables impact carbon and water fluxes at short time scale do not necessarily ‘weaken’ with increasing temporal scales due to feedbacks and ‘soft’ thresholds and switches. The feedbacks, thresholds and switches depend on the limiting factor for each of the climatic regimes and are not expected to be universal, but site specific. Furthermore, the responses are mostly dependent on climate, rather than vegetation type. A future goal is include such effects in dynamic vegetation models using parameterization schemes that are aware of such cross-scale information flow.",

This spatial variability has ramifications for the mitigation of future sea-level change because some coastal regions will be affected more strongly by sea-level rise than others.\nQuantitative projections of future sea-level rise rely on the outputs from climate models. The CMIP5 archive, which contains outputs from more than 60 climate models from 27 research groups, has been mined extensively for the purpose of sea-level projection based on four climate change scenarios. Previous studies show that regional patterns of sea-level change vary with each model. Not only that, but the individual model outputs vary widely in terms of actual resolution and model drift, and these factors have a secondary effect on the resulting projections.\nWe explore the influence of model resolution and drift correction methods upon sea-level projections and consider the projections from a limited set of high resolution model outputs compared to a limited set of low resolution model outputs. Furthermore, we consider the implications for the ensemble mean error for the different sea-level related parameters from the coastline to the sea, and show that projections near the coastline are highly sensitive to the method used for projection calculation.\nThis work contributes to the RISES-AM European Consortium Project, which seeks to provide a detailed holistic assessment of the physical and societal impacts of sea-level change due to high end climate change scenarios (>2°C warming relative to pre-industrial times).",

The complex effects of magnetospheric convection and geomagnetic disturbances on ionospheric electric fields and currents in middle and low latitudes were documented in several studies. Under disturbed conditions the two main sources of electric fields, which are responsible for changes in the plasma drifts and for current perturbations, are the short-lived prompt penetration electric fields (PPEFs) and the longer lasting ionospheric disturbance dynamo (DD) electric fields, and both modulate the TEC around the globe. In this work we present the validation of a computational tool to calculate TEC maps over the low latitude of South America region. We used two methods to calculate the absolute VTEC: TECMAP-Nagoya tool and Magic (NOAA) tool. Their results were compared to the TEC measured by an Allen Osborne receiver placed at São José dos Campos (Brazil) and show a good agreement. The results were performed considering quiet and disturbed conditions, and also HILDCAAs events. Data from the RBMC/IBGE (Brazil), IGS and RAMSAC (Argentina) networks were used to calculate TEC over the South America. The expansion of RBMC and RAMSAC networks is providing a good coverage and understanding of TEC behavior at this complex low latitude region.",

We examine the magnetospheric responses to solar wind dynamic pressure enhancements from April 1, 2007 to December 31, 2012, and find six ULF wave events with slow but clear wave amplitude increase. The amplitudes of ion velocities and magnetic field of these waves continuously increase by 2.1 ∼ 4.4 times during three to six wave cycles. We choose two typical cases to further investigate the cause of this wave amplitude increase. We find that the wave amplitude growth is mainly contributed by the toroidal mode wave. Interestingly, toroidal mode waves are standing, while compressional and poloidal mode waves are not. Thus, we suspect that the wave amplitude increase may be caused by the superposition of two wave sources. One wave source is the standing wave excited by the solar wind dynamic impulse. Additionally, fast mode compressional wave continuously shakes the magnetic field lines. The azimuthal component of this magnetic perturbation is the second wave source. Furthermore, the simple model calculation of superposing two waves match the observations pretty well.",

These governing equations are supplemented with Darcy's law for fluid phase velocities, constraints on species concentrations, equation of states, and constitutive laws. Conventionally, these equations are implicitly coupled via the calculations of secondary variables based on primary variables. The mechanisms of coupling are obscured. In this paper, an innovation THMC modeling is proposed, that explicitly couples governing equations for primary variables. The coupling is accomplished via the storage coefficients, effective transporting velocities, and equivalent conduction-dispersion-diffusion coefficient tensors, one set each for every primary variable. It is believed that this THMC model could serve as a prototype for simulating many types of environmental remediation. Examples will demonstrate the intuition and superiority of this THMC modeling system. Case studies illustrate how to apply this model for environmental remediation as well.",

            "abstract": "Plant Water Use Efficiency (WUE), which is the ratio of the uptake of carbon dioxide through photosynthesis to the loss of water through transpiration, is a powerful metric of the functioning of the land biosphere. WUE is expected to increase with atmospheric CO2, but to decline with increasing atmospheric evaporative demand – which can arise from increases in near-surface temperature or decreases in relative humidity. We have used eddy covariance measurements from the Fluxnet sites, along with d13C measurements from tree rings, to estimate the sensitivities of WUE to changes in CO2 (Ca) and atmospheric humidity deficit (D). This enables us to reconstruct fractional changes in WUE, based on changes in atmospheric climate and CO2, for the entire period of the global climate record.\nThe shorter-term Fluxnet observations span a small range in CO2, but have the temporal resolution to enable the sensitivity of WUE to D to be constrained. By contrast, the tree rings give only annual resolution but are multi-decade timescale records that enable the CO2-sensitivity of WUE to be estimated. In order to derive a robust sensitivity to both Ca and D, we combined all Fluxnet and tree ring sites using a weighted-mean (maximum-likelihood) approach which gives greater emphasis to the sites where each parameter is more tightly defined. We found that WUE most likely increases even more quickly than Ca (fractional sensitivity = 1.36±0.35) and decreases with D (fractional sensitivity = -0.50±0.18). These numbers were used to produce complete spatial maps of WUE changes for every year since 1900. Overall we estimate that WUE increased by 36±9% over the 20th century. This long-term trend is largely driven by increases in CO2, but significant inter-annual variability and regional differences are evident due to variations in temperature and relative humidity, especially in highly-populated regions of Western Europe and China.",

Compared to no facilitation or evenly distributed facilitation, the stress gradient produces more edges in the spatially advancing population, more overall intensity of facilitation, and more individuals further advanced into the area of higher stress; the more enhanced species has increased population relative to the other – to the point where they are equal. Among three neighborhood functions, little difference exists in outcomes between the linear and logarithmic functions, but the unimodal function, which shifts peak facilitation intensity to fewer neighbors, increases the above state variables more than the differences between the even and stress gradient facilitation scenarios. The unbalanced mutualism may be important at treeline ecotones where the spatial pattern becomes central to facilitation.",

            "abstract": "Physically based models for permafrost-hydrological interactions can contribute to improved process understanding and aid in bridging the gap between limited field observations and large scale heat, water and material transport effects. Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of including coupled heat and multiphase flow processes in order to better understand and describe the dynamics of permafrost change and its interactions with temperature and subsurface water conditions in partially frozen ground. In particular, long-term simulation results show that warming trends reduce the temporal and seasonal variability characteristics of groundwater and its discharges into surface waters.\nA compelling question for waterborne transport of substances relevant for climate feedbacks, biogeochemical cycling and/or water pollution is how different scenarios of hydro-climatic change influence permafrost formation and degradation dynamics and through that also the residence times of subsurface water, from land surface recharge to surface water discharge. In this contribution, heat transport and water flow in permafrost systems which include the active layer are simulated and changes in water fluxes and associated travel times of water parcels through the subsurface are investigated. Initial results indicate that the geological setting can notably impact the spread and change in travel time distributions during warming. Also, for all cases investigated the median and minimum travel times increase, indicating longer flow pathways as permafrost thaws. Potential effects on solute transport and climatic feedbacks are highlighted.",

Ion measurements are made using an orthogonal pair of Thermal Ion Imager sensors which image 2-D (energy/angle) distributions of rammed ion populations, providing ion drift and temperature estimates in three directions. Ion flows are resolved to ~10 m/s at 2 samples/s. We show examples of ion upflow at high latitudes, as well as vertical drift variations of order 1 m/s resolved through averaging of slowly-varying drifts near the equator. We also report occurences of highly anisotropic ion temperature at high latitudes, in most cases with temperature perpendicular to B exceeding that parallel to B, though with some exceptions. During the first two months of operation, the Swarm satellites followed each other in a \"pearls on a string\" arrangement, providing a picture of the time evolution, on a one-minute time scale, of regions of enhanced energy dissipation as determined via the Poynting vector. Finally we show examples of highly structured plasma flows associated with auroral arcs observed by ground-based cameras.",

            "abstract": "The Sumatra subduction zone is one of the most seismically active subduction zone on the Earth. Although there has been three Mw >8.4 earthquakes in the region, including the disastrous 2004 Mw=9.2 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake, a 500 km long patch around Mentawai Islands is still locked and could produce a large megathrust earthquake. If the rupture propagates to the subduction front, which was the case for the 2004 earthquake, it may lead to another devastating tsunami. We have access to a very high-quality industry deep seismic reflection profile from the locked zone, which shows seismic image of the subducting interface down to 20 km depth. These data also show bi-vergent 1-3 km wide anticlinal pop-up structures that extend up to 40 km from the subduction front.\nUnderneath these pop-up structures, we find sub-horizontal reflectors. Full waveform inversion of seismic data indicates that the base of these pop-up structures coincides with a sharp change in P-wave velocity where the velocity varies 3.55 - 3.79 km/s suggesting the presence of a décollement surface where the pop-up structures seem to be rooted. Using these results, we perform mechanical modelling to determine the mechanical process and frictional properties along the accretionary wedge. We find that the presence of a ramp with a lower effective friction (intermediate décollement) is required to develop bi-vergence (pop-up) structures. Furthermore, we model bi-vergence (pop-up) structures in the frontal part to estimate the frictional properties and assess the tsunamigenic potential. We find that the effective frictional values are low, suggesting that up dip part of the plate interface is seismogenic. We also estimate different scenario of frontal slip and possibly vertical uplift. We find that horizontal slip could be up to 8.8 m whereas the vertical slip could be up to 1.3 m, which at 6 km water depth could generate devastating tsunami in the region.",

            "abstract": "The near-surface mineralogy of terrestrial planets and moons, and the corresponding evolution of habitable environments, is shaped by physical, chemical, and biological processes. Four factors contribute to a planet’s mineral distribution and diversity: (1) planetary stoichiometry; (2) crystal chemical characteristics; (3) mineral stability ranges; and (4) the probability of occurrence for rare minerals. Measurements of stellar stoichiometry reveal that stars can differ significantly from the Sun in relative abundances of rock-forming elements, which implies that bulk compositions of some extrasolar Earth-like planets differ significantly from those of Earth, particularly if fractionation processes in evolving stellar nebulas and planetary differentiation are factored in. Comparison of Earth’s upper continental crust and the Moon shows that differences in element ratios are reflected in ratios of mineral species containing these elements. More abundant elements generally have larger numbers of mineral species, though elements that mimic other more abundant elements are less likely to form their own species. Total mineral diversity for different elements is not appreciably influenced by the relative stabilities of individual phases, e.g., the broad pressure-temperature-composition stability range of zircon (ZrSiO4) does not significantly diminish the total number of observed Zr minerals. To the extent that origins and evolution of life depend on key mineral species, habitability is dependent on the emergence of a minimal mineral diversity. Evolving life has, in turn, exerted the largest single influence on mineral diversity. Notably, changes in near-surface redox conditions on Earth through the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis tripled the available “composition space” of Earth’s near-surface environment, and resulted in a corresponding tripling of mineral diversity subsequent to atmospheric oxidation. Statistical analysis of mineral frequency distributions suggests that thousands of plausible rare mineral species await discovery or could have occurred at some point in Earth’s history, only to be subsequently lost by burial, erosion, or subduction—i.e., much of Earth’s mineral diversity associated with rare species results from stochastic processes.",

The region has great impacts on environmental changes in China, the Northern Hemisphere and the globe.It also demonstrates sensitive feedbacks to global changes and the impacts of anthropogenic activities in surrounding regions. Like the Arctic and Antarctica, the Third Pole region is an especially sensitive area that draws great attention from the scientific community. In 2009, with support from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and international organizations, the Third Pole Environment (TPE) program, led by Chinese scientists, was officially launched. The program focuses on the theme of “water-ice-air-ecosystem-human” interactions, with the aim to address the following scientific questions, such as the spatial and temporal characteristics of past environmental changes in the Third pole, the interactions between hydrosphere and cryosphere and hazard processes, the ecological systems’ impacts on and response to environmental changes, and the impacts of anthropogenic activities on environmental changes in the region and adaptation strategies. The goal of the program is to reveal environmental change processes and mechanisms on the Third Pole and their influences on and responses to global changes, and thus to serve for enhancement of human adaptation to the changing environment and realization of human-nature harmony.\nUnder the leadership of the co-chairs, and relying on Scientific Committee and the TPE office, the program has accomplished a number of scientific tasks since its inauguration. TPE has made tremendous progress in the research of glacier changes, interactions between the westerlies and monsoon, establishment of field stations, data sharing and education.",

To maintain the design depth of -14 m below ALLW (Approximately Lowest Low Water) from the tidal flat of 2 m above LLW, dredging operation has been repeated over the last 13 years within the unbalanced (disequilibrium) North Harbour. In efforts to reduce the siltation within the harbour, this paper deals with the estimation of siltation rate and the determination of the mechanism for the siltation within the North Harbour. The siltation rate was estimated and then confirmed by the following three independent methods: comparison of available hydrographic survey data (smooth sheet), radioisotope analysis of gravity cores and altimeter measurement of bed level. The sedimentation rate varied from 20 cm/yr in the far end of the harbour to about 70 cm/yr at the entrance. In order to determine dominant mechanisms for siltation, two ADCPs and two CTDs were deployed at the entrance and the far end of the harbour over a month, and examined flow mechanisms for a harbour basin. The preliminary results suggest that the mechanisms include Suspended Particulate Material (SPM) exchange by horizontal entrainment through the harbour mouth and trapping of SPM in the harbour basin.",

            "abstract": "With the flood consequences likely to amplify because of the growing population and ongoing accumulation of assets in flood-prone areas, global flood hazard and risk maps are needed for improving flood preparedness at large scale. At the same time, with the rapidly growing archives of SAR images of floods, there is a high potential of making use of these images for global and regional flood management. In this framework, an original method that integrates global flood inundation modeling and microwave remote sensing is presented. It takes advantage of the combination of the time and space continuity of a global inundation model with the high spatial resolution of satellite observations. The availability of model simulations over a long time period offers opportunities for estimating flood non-exceedance probabilities in a robust way. These probabilities can be attributed to historical satellite observations. Time series of SAR-derived flood extent maps and associated non-exceedance probabilities can then be combined generate flood hazard maps with a spatial resolution equal to that of the satellite images, which is most of the time higher than that of a global inundation model. In principle, this can be done for any area of interest in the world, provided that a sufficient number of relevant remote sensing images are available.\nAs a test case we applied the method on the Severn River (UK) and the Zambezi River (Mozambique), where large archives of Envisat flood images can be exploited. The global ECMWF flood inundation model is considered for computing the statistics of extreme events. A comparison with flood hazard maps estimated with in situ measured discharge is carried out. The first results confirm the potentiality of the method. However, further developments on two aspects are required to improve the quality of the hazard map and to ensure the acceptability of the product by potential end user organizations. On the one hand, it is of paramount importance to improve the skill of the global inundation model for reliably estimating flood occurrence probabilities, which is critical since errors in the model are directly transferred to the resulting hazard map. On the other hand, the spatial and temporal sampling of the satellite observations needs to be improved in order to provide more detailed and more reliable maps.",

An example is given with a high-resolution 3D aquifer analog with known hydraulic conductivity (K) and porosity (n) at every location. MAD is applied using different combinations of simulated measurements of K, n, and different scales of hydraulic head that represent different field methods. The ln(K) and n SRF parameters are characterized with each of the method combinations to assess the influence of the methods on the SRFs and their implications. The forward modeling equations are solved by the numerical modeling software OpenGeoSys (\nopengeosys.org\n) and MAD is applied with the software MAD# (\nmad.codeplex.com\n). The inverse modeling results are compared to the aquifer analog for success evaluation. The goal of the study is to show how integrating combinations of multi-scale and multi-type measurements from the field via MAD can be used to reduce the uncertainty in field-scale SRFs, as well as point values, of hydraulic properties.",

            "abstract": "Most time dependent rupture probability (TDRP) models are basically designed for a single-mode rupture, i.e. a single characteristic earthquake on a fault. However, most subduction zones rupture in complex patterns that create overlapping earthquakes of different magnitudes. Additionally, the limited historic earthquake data does not provide sufficient information to estimate reliable mean recurrence intervals for earthquakes. This makes it difficult to identify a single characteristic earthquake for TDRP analysis. Physical models based on geodetic data have been successfully used to obtain information on the state of coupling and slip deficit rates for subduction zones. Coupling information provides valuable insight into the complexity of subduction zone rupture processes.\nIn this study we present a TDRP model that is formulated based on subduction zone slip deficit rate distribution. A subduction zone is represented by an integrated network of cells. Each cell ruptures multiple times from numerous earthquakes that have overlapping rupture areas. The rate of rupture for each cell is calculated using a moment balance concept that is calibrated based on historic earthquake data. The information in conjunction with estimates of coseismic slip from past earthquakes is used to formulate time dependent rupture probability models for cells. Earthquakes on the subduction zone and their rupture probabilities are calculated by integrating different combinations of cells. The resulting rupture probability estimates are fully consistent with the state of coupling of the subduction zone and the regional and local earthquake history as the model takes into account the impact of all large (M>7.5) earthquakes on the subduction zone. The granular rupture model as developed in this study allows estimating rupture probabilities for large earthquakes other than just a single characteristic magnitude earthquake. This provides a general framework for formulating physically-based rupture probability models for large earthquakes on subduction zones that is consistent with their true locking state and earthquake history. We will present the formulation of the proposed model and its application to the Nazca plate subduction zone.",

            "abstract": "Deep seismic data represent a key to understand the geometry and mechanism of continental rifting. The passive continental margin of NW-Africa is one of the oldest on earth, formed during the Upper Triassic–Lower Liassic rifting of the central Atlantic Ocean over 200 Ma. We present new and existing wide-angle and reflection seismic data from three study regions along the margin located in the North Moroccan salt basin, on the central continental margin offshore Safi and in the south, offshore Dakhla. In each of the study areas several combined wide-angle and reflection seismic profiles perpendicular and parallel to the margin have been acquired and forward modelled using comparable methods. The thickness of unthinned continental crust decreases from 36 km in the North to about 27 km in the South. In the North Moroccan Basin continental crust thins from originally 36 km to about 8 km in a 150 km wide zone. The basin itself is underlain by highly thinned continental crust. Offshore safi thinning of the continental crust is confined to a 130 km wide zone with no neighboring sedimentary basin underlain by continental crust. In both areas the zone of crustal thinning is characterised by the presence of large blocks and abundant salt diapirs. In the south crustal thinning is more rapid in a zone of 90 km and asymmetric with the upper crust thinning more closely to the continent than the lower crust, probably due to depth-dependent stretching and the presence of the precambrian Reguibat Ridge on land. Oceanic crust is characterised by a thickness of 7-8 km along the complete margin. Relatively high velocities of up to 7.5 km/s have been imaged between magnetic anomalies S1 and M25, and are probably related to changes in the spreading velocities at the time of the Kimmeridgian/Tithonian plate reorganisation. Volcanic activity seems to be confined to the region next to the Canary Islands, and is thus not related to the initial opening of the oceanic, which was related to no or only weak volcanism.",

Depressurization method is a method to reduce the bottom hole pressure by submersible pump lowering water level in the production well, and gas and water is recovered by MH dissociation at the in situ. During the depressurization operation, consolidation and deformation of sediment occurs because of increase of effective stress by depressurization and changes in the soil structure by MH dissociation. Then consolidation and deformation of sediment makes negative friction between the production well and sediment, and large stress is occur in casing. Therefore there is concern that it may cause compression failure and shear failure of the production well. For safe MH development, it is necessary to grasp the deformation and stress vicinity of the production well.\nAt first, we conducted push-out test to get friction strength between the different materials simulated the well and sediment. And we have done numerical analysis for integrity using by these data. The results of numerical analysis showed that the large deformation of sediment occur around the depressurization zone, and for the well, the large tensile stress in the vertical direction occur the upper vicinity of the depressurization zone.\nThis study was financially supported by the Research Consortium for Methane Hydrate Resources in Japan (MH21 Research Consortium) planned by Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI).

            "abstract": "The role of salt marshes in controlling silica exchange between terrestrial and marine environments is unclear. In some studies, large quantities of dissolved silica (DSi) appear to be exported from marshes via tidal exchange, potentially fueling future diatom production in adjacent waters. In contrast, other studies report insignificant DSi export and found instead that salt marshes appeared to be Si sinks. Further, few studies examine salt marsh Si export in relation to inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and phosphorus (DIP). We address these uncertainties by quantifying net fluxes of DSi and biogenic Si (BSi), as well as DIN and DIP during the spring and summer in a relatively undisturbed southern New England salt marsh (Narragansett Bay, USA). Our data demonstrates that during the spring, when estuarine waters are deplete in DSi, the marsh serves as a net sink of BSi (132 mol h-1) and a source of DSi (31 mol h-1) to the estuary. The spring DIN:DSi ratios of ebbing water were more than five times lower than flood waters. Most importantly, the DSi export rates (6.5 x103 mol d-1 km-2) are an order of magnitude larger than the export by rivers in the region (115 mol d-1 km-2), indicating the marsh tidal exchange is vital in supplying the Si necessary for spring diatom blooms in the estuary. Conversely, during the summer the marsh served as a net Si sink, importing on average 59 mol DSi h-1 and 39 mol BSi h-1. These data highlight that the role of salt marshes in silica cycling appears to have a strong seasonality. We hypothesize that net import of Si increases the residence time of Si in estuarine systems, providing an important and previously over-looked ecosystem service. In the absence of salt marshes, ~5.1 x 104 kmol of Si would be exported from this system during the growing season, possibly decreasing Si availability and altering phytoplankton species composition in the estuary.",

            "abstract": "The phreatic explosion crater King’s Bowl (KB), at Craters of the Moon, Idaho, can serve as an analog to pits with similar morphologies on the Moon, Mars, and Vesta. These pits are associated with the release of water and are of interest to the planetary science and astrobiology research communities. KB crater was formed 2,220 ± 100 B.P. when a magmatic dike encountered subsurface water. The resulting explosion created an 85 m long, 30 m wide and 30 m deep crater and ejected blocks distances in excess of 100 m. Here we describe fieldwork and observations performed by the NASA SSERVI FINESSE (Field Investigations to Enable Solar System Science) team. Our objective is to utilize the distribution of ejecta blocks at King’s Bowl to better understand the formation energetics associated with such pits and to quantify the amount of water necessary to produce them on other planetary bodies.\nWe focused on the western KB ejecta field, and ran a westerly line, a line N45oW, and a line S45oW. Along these transects, we photographed and recorded the location, size and mass (when <18 kg) of every block > 20 cm. We collected photographs normal to the surface, every 10 m, to determine block number density. Thirdly, we walked in a raster pattern through the field cataloging blocks >20 cm. Finally, we mapped the perimeter of the crater.\nInitial results suggest similarities between KB ejecta distributions and ejecta of impact craters on Earth, asteroids, Phobos, Deimos, and the Moon. These similarities are; the radial extent of the ejecta, the decrease in number density with distance, the aspect ratio of the blocks, proximity of the largest blocks to the rim, and the size of the largest blocks relative to the crater diameter. This implies a similar physics of formation on differing bodies whether derived through impact or phreatic explosion. Further studies at KB crater will provide insight to the formation of phreatic explosion pits on other planetary bodies, most especially the volume of water necessary to form them.",

            "abstract": "Following an 18-month period of quiescence at Volcán de Colima – the longest seen since the beginning of the 1998 eruptive regime – the latest effusive period was heralded by the partial destruction of the 2007 lava dome by a significant explosion on 6th January, 2013. Subsequent small Vulcanian explosions, which have been more frequent than during the preceding 2007-2011 effusive period, have accompanied the extrusion of new lava. The effusion, which continues to the present day (July, 2014), has been monitored by monthly overflights in a light aircraft, allowing aerial surveys of the activity through the capture of oblique photographs and thermal infrared imagery. Using ‘structure from motion’ based photogrammetric analysis of the photographs has enabled metre-to-sub-metre resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) to be produced[1], from which volumetric and morphological changes to the dome can be assessed. Although extrusion of lava was observed on the 10th January, it was not until a subsequent survey on 25th February, in which a newly emplaced blocky dome was apparent in the excavated crater, that a reliable effusion rate could be calculated. The derived volumetric change, excluding losses due to minor explosions during this period, represents an effusion rate of <0.1 m3s-1, similar to that of that of the 2007-2011 effusion period (~0.02 m3s-1) and indicative of another period of slow growth. Continued growth of the dome led it to overflow the crater and form a lava flow, as detected in the survey of 21st March. The combination of regular oblique photography with a consumer camera and the use of modern 3D photo-based reconstruction software has enabled unprecedented numbers of DEMs to be produced for activity at Colima. We explore the potential of integrating the thermal data with the surface models for visualisation of areas of elevated activity.\n[1] James & Varley (2012) Identification of structural controls in an active lava dome with high resolution DEMs: Volcán de Colima, Mexico, Geophys.

            "abstract": "Long-term climatic and hydrologic observations on the Santee Experimental Forest in the lower coastal plain of South Carolina were used to estimate long-term changes in hydrology and forest carbon dynamics for a pair of first-order watersheds. Over 70 years of climate data indicated that warming in this forest area in the last decades was faster than the global mean; 35+ years of hydrologic records showed that forest ecosystem succession three years following Hurricane Hugo caused a substantial change in the ratio of runoff to precipitation. The change in this relationship between the paired watersheds was attributed to altered evapotranspiration processes caused by greater abundance of pine in the treatment watershed and regeneration of the mixed hardwood-pine forest on the reference watershed. The long-term records and anomalous observations are highly valuable for reliable calibration and validation of hydrological and biogeochemical models capturing the effects of climate variability. We applied the hydrological model MIKESHE that showed that runoff and water table level are sensitive to global warming, and that the sustained warming trends can be expected to decrease stream discharge and lower the mean water table depth. The spatially-explicit biogeochemical model Forest-DNDC, validated using biomass measurements from the watersheds, was used to assess carbon dynamics in response to high resolution hydrologic observation data and simulation results. The simulations showed that the long-term spatiotemporal carbon dynamics, including biomass and fluxes of soil carbon dioxide and methane were highly regulated by disturbance regimes, climatic conditions and water table depth. The utility of linked-modeling framework demonstrated here to assess biogeochemical responses at the watershed scale suggests applications for assessing the consequences of climate change within an urbanizing forested landscape. The approach may also be applicable for validating large-scale models.",

            "abstract": "Information on location and spatial distribution of crops is extremely important within many applications such as crop area estimation, crop yield forecasting and environmental impact analysis [1-2]. Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) instruments on board remote sensing satellites offer unique features to imaging crops due to their all weather capabilities and ability to capture crop characteristics not available by optical instruments. This abstract aims to explore feasibility and the use of multi-temporal multi-polarization SAR images along with multi-temporal optical images to crop classification in Ukraine using a neural network ensemble.\nThe study area included a JECAM test site in Ukraine which is a part of the Global Agriculture Monitoring (GEOGLAM) initiative. Six optical images were acquired by Landsat-8, and twelve SAR images were acquired by Radarsat-2 (six in FQ8W mode with angle 28 deg., and FQ20W with angle 40 deg.) over the study region. Optical images were atmospherically corrected. SAR images were filtered for speckle, and converted to backscatter coefficients. Ground truth data on crop type (274 polygons) were collected during the summer of 2013. In order to perform supervised classification of multi-temporal satellite imagery, an ensemble of neural networks, in particular multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), was used. The use of the ensemble allowed us to improve overall (OA) classification accuracy from +0.1% to +2% comparing to an individual network. Adding multi-temporal SAR images to multi-temporal optical images improved both OA and individual class accuracies, in particular for sunflower (gains up to +25.9%), soybeans (+16.2%), and maize (+6.2%). It was also found that better OA can be obtained using shallow angle (FQ20W, 40°) OA=77% over steeper angle (FQ8W, 28°) OA=71.78%.\n1. F.

These estimates can be used in disaster management setting or by commercial entities to optimize the deployment of resources and/or routing of goods and materials. This work outlines an end-to-end, modular process to generate estimates of damage caused by severe weather. The processing stream consists of five generic components:\n1) Hazard modules that provide quantitate data layers for each peril.\n2) Standardized methods to map the hazard data to an exposure layer based on atomic geospatial blocks.\n3) Peril-specific damage functions that compute damage metrics at the atomic geospatial block level.\n4) Standardized data aggregators, which map damage to user-specific geometries.\n5) Data dissemination modules, which provide resulting damage estimates in a variety of output forms.\nThis presentation provides a description of this generic tool set, and an illustrated example using HWRF-based hazard data for Hurricane Arthur (2014). In this example, the Python-based real-time processing ingests GRIB2 output from the HWRF numerical model, dynamically downscales it in conjunctions with a land cover database using a multiprocessing pool, and a just-in-time compiler (JIT). The resulting wind fields are contoured, and ingested into a PostGIS database using OGR. Finally, the damage estimates are calculated at the atomic block level and aggregated to user-defined regions using PostgreSQL queries to construct application specific tabular and graphics output.",

            "abstract": "The measurement and prediction of the fine sediment budget for the Colorado River in Grand Canyon has been of strong scientific and management interest since erosion of sandbars was first reported in the early 1970s, about 10 years after Glen Canyon Dam began regulating streamflow and eliminated the upstream sediment supply. Efforts to rebuild eroded sandbars have consisted largely of the experimental release of controlled floods, during which sand is redistributed from the bed to eddy sandbars along the channel margin. Flood-aggraded sandbars are, however, inherently unstable and inevitably erode between floods. Thus, sandbars cannot be “preserved,” but are dynamic landforms that require periodic rebuilding by recurring floods. Such a strategy, with the goal of achieving a long-term increase in the size and number of sandbars, was recently implemented as a policy initiative of the U.S. Department of the Interior. This High Flow Experiment Protocol is being implemented by a unique collaboration of scientists, engineers, and policy makers and provides a rare example of a case in which management decisions are fully integrated with scientific monitoring. Controlled floods are scheduled based on real-time monitoring of sediment flux, computations of sediment budgets, and use of flow and sediment models. Floods are scheduled to occur within a few weeks of measurement results becoming available, assuming that threshold triggers for sediment accumulation are met. Sandbar building results are evaluated within weeks to months using remotely deployed time-lapse cameras. The protocol has been implemented in fall 2013 and fall 2014. Preliminary results suggest that the program may be resulting in the desired effect of cumulative increases in sandbar size. These results are tentative, because recent years have been relatively favorable, with large fine-sediment inputs and low annual dam-release volumes. Successive years with low fine-sediment supply or above-average dam releases could cause the flood protocol to result in progressive fine-sediment depletion. Ultimately, success depends on factors that cannot be controlled and are difficult to predict. For these reasons, the protocol is designed as a long-term experiment whose success will be evaluated based on implementation and evaluation over 10 to 20 years.",

            "abstract": "In this study, Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), and its components Gross Ecosystem Exchange (GEE) and Ecosystem Respiration (RESP), were compared from a lumped, regional model and a mechanistic, hillslope-scale model to determine if the effects of land management on the carbon cycle are captured by larger-scale biosphere models that determine CO2 sources and sinks. WRF-VPRM (Weather Research & Forecasting – Vegetation Photosynthesis & Respiration Model) is a regional-scale model that uses simulated downward shortwave radiation and surface temperatures, along with satellite-derived land cover indices and eddy flux tower-derived parameters to estimate biosphere CO2 fluxes with empirical equations. The DAYCENT biogeochemical model coupled with the Watershed Erosion Prediction Project model (WEPP), which simulates changes in soil carbon stocks due to different land management and the resulting enhanced erosion, can also quantify biosphere CO2 fluxes. Both models (i.e., WRF-VPRM and WEPP-DAYCENT) were used to quantify GEE, RESP, and NEE for the summer of 2008 in the IML-CZO Clear Creek watershed of the U.S. Midwest to examine the role of land management heterogeneity in CO2 exchanges between the biosphere and atmosphere. Comparing average daily GEE rates from WRF-VPRM (-11.0 ± 5.2 g C/m2/d) with WEPP-DAYCENT average values weighted per land use area in the watershed (-10.2 ± 1.5 g C/m2/d) showed no significant differences (t-test; p=0.08). In contrast, daily RESP values were different between the two models. Daily respiration rates were relatively constant for WRF-VPRM (6.0 ± 0.8 g C/m2/d), while WEPP-DAYCENT values for each management practice were significantly greater (7.2 ± 1.8 g C/m2/d; t-test, p<0.001) with the land uses experiencing tillage having the widest ranges. WEPP-DAYCENT accounts for the effects of land management and net erosion/deposition on total SOC stocks and tillage impacts on respiration by increasing decomposition from the breaking of soil aggregates and enhanced mineralization. In WRF-VPRM, respiration is calculated with a regression equation based on air temperature. As a result, comparison of average daily NEE rates from WRF-VPRM (-5.0 ± 5.3 g C/m2/d) with WEPP-DAYCENT average weighted values (-3.0 ± 1.8 g C/m2/d) also showed significant differences (t-test; p<0.001).",

            "abstract": "The colloid deposition behavior observed at the Darcy scale represents an average of the processes occurring at the pore scale. Hence, a better understanding of the processes occurring at the Darcy scale can be obtained by studying colloid transport at the pore-scale and then upscaling the results. In this study, we have developed a mathematical model to simulate the transport of colloids in a cylindrical pore by considering various processes such as advection, diffusion, colloid-soil surface interactions and hydrodynamic wall effects. The pore space is divided into three different regions, namely, the bulk, diffusion and potential regions, based on the dominant processes acting in each of these regions. In the bulk region, colloid transport is governed by advection and diffusion; whereas in the diffusion region, colloid mobility due to diffusion is retarded by hydrodynamic wall effects. Colloid-solid interaction forces dominate the transport in the potential region where colloid deposition occurs and are calculated using DLVO theory. The expressions for mass transfer rate coefficients between the diffusion and potential regions have been derived for different DLVO energy profiles. These are incorporated in the pore-scale equations in the form of a boundary condition at the diffusion-potential region interface. The model results are used to obtain the colloid breakthrough curve at the end of a long pore, and then it is fitted with 1D advection-dispersion-adsorption model so as to determine the averaged attachment and detachment rate coefficients at the scale of a single pore. A sensitivity analysis of the model to six pore-scale parameters (colloid and wall surface potentials, solution ionic strength, average pore-water velocity, colloid radius, and pore radius) is carried out so as to find the relation between the averaged deposition rate coefficients at pore scale vs the pore-scale parameters. We found an hyper exponential relation between the colloid attachment rate coefficient vs the parameters describing DLVO energy profile, and a power law relationship between colloid attachment rate coefficient vs the average pore-water velocity. The current model forms the building block for upscaling colloid transport from pore scale to Darcy scale using Pore Network Modeling.",

            "abstract": "Agricultural production and urban development in Puerto Rico have increased the rate of sedimentation to the coastal, marine environment, which has the potential to adversely affect coral-reef ecosystems. The processes of settlement and metamorphosis of coral larvae are integral to the maintenance and recovery of coral reefs, yet the effects of sedimentation in Puerto Rico on these processes are not well understood. Planulae from laboratory cultured colonies of Favia fragum were exposed to sediment from shallow, marine habitats of Guánica (Brown Inlet) and Peñuelas (Tallaboa Bay), Puerto Rico to determine how sediment source, concentration, and grain-size affect larval settlement. Planulae were exposed to six concentrations of Guánica and Peñuelas sediment ranging from 20 to 640 mg cm-2 and to a single concentration (20 mg cm-2) of Peñuelas sediment fractioned into five grain-size classes (<32 µm, 33-63 µm, 64-125 µm, 126-250 µm, and 251-500 µm). Larval settlement decreased as the concentration of sediment increased, resulting in a median effective concentration (EC50) of 31.2 mg cm-2 for Guánica sediment and 1.7 mg cm-2 for Peñuelas sediment. There was no apparent effect of sediment grain size on the settlement of planulae exposed to 20 mg cm-2 of Peñuelas sediment. These results suggest that the source of sediment can be an important factor determining the success of coral settlement, and that coral settlement can be inhibited at concentrations of sediment that are below thresholds considered to be protective of reef-building corals.",

            "abstract": "West Bengal Coast and Indian part of Sundarbans is highly vulnerable to various natural as well as anthropogenic activities there by causing huge impact on socio-economic structure of the region. The West Bengal coast is located at latitude 21°35’ N and longitude 87° 30’, 89° 10’ E with a coastline of 210 km and very irregular in shape. High frequency of tropical cyclones cross the West Bengal coast results in storm surges which will have large impact on the shoreline changes there by making the coast more vulnerable. Hence, understanding of shore line changes as well as the geomorphological patterns of the coast is highly essential for planning, prevention of loss of life and property. In the present study, an attempt has been made to delineate these changes using remote sensing and GIS methods over the study region. For this purpose LANDSAT imagery obtained from USGS for the years 1973, 1989 and 2010 is used for identifying the decadal changes of shoreline as well as geomorphological features. The MNDW Index has been used in delineating land and water boundary over the region. Results revealed significant changes in the shore line along the West Bengal coast as the shore-line shifting of 500 meters is noticed towards the land in some locations. Some portion of Sundarbans has shown significant erosion from 1973 to 2010 of the order of 3 km. From the analysis it is seen that more coastal erosion is over West Medinipur coastal area. Nayachar Island, Sagar Island and five more small islands near the mouth of Hugly estuary are prone to this shoreline change which may be attributed to sediment discharge and wave action, along with storm surges and inundation.\nKey words: Shore line, Geomorphology, Remote Sensing and GIS",

            "abstract": "The mid-Miocene Jack Springs Tuff (JST) outcrops across the western Mina Deflection accommodation zone, west-central Nevada and into eastern California. Previously, the source location for the JST was unknown, yet recent studies northwest of Mono Lake, CA have identified a relatively un-rotated structural block in which to reference the paleomagnetic data. Although new studies have indicated that this block may be rotated up to 13º, we argue that the probable source area is located near the Bodie Hills, CA. At this site, the paleomagnetic reference direction is D = 353°, I = 43°, α95 = 7.7° (Carlson et al, 2013). Based on these data, the JST can be used to measure absolute vertical-axis rotation as well as enable reconstruction of the paleo-topography using the corrected anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) data. A total of 19 sites were sampled to constrain Cenozoic to recent vertical axis rotation within the region and AMS experiments were conducted to determine the flow direction of the JST. Curie point estimates indicate that the JST ranges in titanium concentration from 0.042 to 1.10, indicating a low to moderate titanomagnetite phase (Akimoto, 1962). Demagnetization experiments reveal mean destructive fields of the NRM ranging between 15mT and 40mT suggesting that both multi-domain to pseudo-single domain grains are the dominant ferromagnetic phases that carry the remanence and AMS fabric. Preliminary paleomagnetic data yield stable single component demagnetization behavior for most sites that, after structural correction, indicate clockwise vertical axis rotation ranging from +20°± 10° to +60°± 11° between multiple fault blocks. The uncorrected AMS data yield oblate magnetic fabrics that can be used to infer the transport direction, source region, and paleovalley geometry of the JST. These data are tentatively interpreted to indicate west to east transport of the JST across the Mono Basin region into the Mina Deflection that was erupted and flowed into a paleovalley off the Sierra Nevada Mountain front. Based on the new paleomagnetic data, we hypothesize that the JST experienced clockwise vertical axis rotation associated with transtensional faulting east of Mono Lake, CA. Our paleomagnetic data support this hypothesis and we argue that deformation likely occurred between ca. 9.5 Ma to as late as 3 Ma.",

            "abstract": "In oil sands projects in Alberta, Canada, salvaged soils are often placed in large stockpiles where they are stored for the duration of the project, typically 20-30 years. Alberta regulations require that topsoil and subsoil are salvaged in two distinct operations – a process known as two-lifting. Reclamation using long-term stockpiled soils often gives poor results, characterized by lower soil organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations compared with equivalent natural, undisturbed soils. It is thought that the change from an aerobic to an anaerobic environment during soil stockpiling and back again to aerobic during placement are largely responsible for the low carbon and nitrogen due to microbial activity transforming C and N in the soil into CO2, CH4 and N2O and releasing them to the atmosphere. Evidence from recent studies indicates that biochar improves soil physical, chemical and biological properties, and hence could mitigate C and N losses due to greenhouse gas emissions from the soil indirectly. We postulate that documented improvements in soil physical, chemical, and biological properties in soils treated with amendments such as biochar may help mitigate C and N losses due to greenhouse gas emissions from the soil indirectly. This laboratory incubation experiment tested the effects of differential rates (0, 10, 20, and 40 g biochar carbon equivalents kg-1 dry soil) of biochar, peat, and humalite on greenhouse gas emissions from a 25-year old two-lift stockpiled soil. The soils were fertilized according to standard practice, placed in 120-mL plastic containers, and incubated at 25°C for 45 days. Gas samples were taken at 1- to 7-day intervals and analyzed for CO2, CH4, and N2O. Data on treatment differences in emissions will be presented. Results from this experiment will provide an insight into the potential for organic amendments to mitigate greenhouse gas emission during reclamation using degraded soils.",

Focusing on the changes during the era of manned space missions (1961-2014) we extend our analysis of the vertical cutoff rigidity variations to about 450 km i.e. to the International Space Station (ISS) orbit. The outcome of this analysis will be compared to measurements of the DOSimetry TELescope (DOSTEL), an instrument that has been operational for several time periods onboard the ISS, allowing to determine the response function of the instrument. Using the Force-Field parameter derived from neutron monitors (see Usoskin et al., 2011) we will present maps of DOSTEL measurements for more than 50 years that are caused by galactic cosmic ray variations along hypothetical ISS orbits.",

            "abstract": "The impacts of climatic variations on different components of the hydrological cycle have been extensively examined, while studies on groundwater responses to recent climate change are limited. In particular, the implications for the long term increases of shallow groundwater temperatures, as an important driver for water quality, and the adherent consequences for groundwater-dependent ecosystems are not comprehensively understood. In this study we therefore scrutinized the coupling of atmospheric and groundwater warming by employing stochastic and deterministic models. Measurements of groundwater temperatures were obtained in observations wells over four decades from two aquifers in Germany and linked to air temperature time series from local weather stations and to aggregated time series over different spatial scales. In order to examine the relationship between air and groundwater temperature time series, breakpoints in the long term means were identified by employing statistical analyses. The observed increases in shallow groundwater temperatures can be associated with preceding positive changes in regional surface air temperatures, which are in turn linked to global air temperature variations. Furthermore, we employed an analytical solution to the conduction-advection heat transfer equation to explore the thermal processes that control heat propagation in the subsurface. The predicted groundwater temperatures generally concur with the observed trends in the measured time series. The temperature increase in shallow aquifers is more gradual than the causal atmospheric warming, because the thermal signals from distinct changes in air temperature are diffused in the subsurface. These observations indicate that shallow groundwater temperatures respond rapidly to atmospheric changes. Thus, future climate change is likely to have a significant impact not only on economically important aquifers, but also on groundwater-dependent ecosystems.",

This reconnection process produces open magnetic field lines (i.e. field lines of the magnetosphere that close through the interplanetary medium) that are dragged to the magnetotail by the solar wind flow, where they eventually reconnect again, back to a closed topology.\nThe SI12 imaging of the Doppler-shifted Lyman-α emission of the proton aurora is used to estimate the location of the boundary separating open and closed field lines at ionospheric altitude. We then estimate the open magnetic flux of the Earth magnetosphere, encircled by this boundary. The rate of reconnection causing a variation of the open magnetic flux can be expressed as a voltage in application of Faraday’s law. This voltage is measured along the open/closed field line boundary determined from the imaging data. The electric field associated with the voltage has two origins: motion of the boundary and the ionospheric field. We use the ionospheric electric field deduced from ionospheric convection measurement from the SuperDARN to estimate the reconnection voltage at the magnetopause (flux opening) and in the magnetotail (flux closure) accounting for the motion of the open/closed field line boundary determined from the SI12 images. The method is applied during several (strong) geomagnetic storms. These intervals are characterized by large values of open flux and reconnection rates, as a result of coupling between the solar wind and the geomagnetic environment. We present these results in terms of a magnetospheric mode that develops under strong coupling with the solar wind, a condition known to be prone to the development of sawtooth events, characterized by overloading of the magnetosphere with open magnetic flux.",

            "abstract": "The East Africa region experiences severe weather events associated with hazards of varying magnitude. It receives heavy precipitation which leads to wide spread flooding and lack of sufficient rainfall in some parts results into drought. Cases of flooding and drought are two key forecasting challenges for the Kenya Meteorological Service (KMS). The source of heat and moisture depends on the state of the land surface which interacts with the boundary layer of the atmosphere to produce excessive precipitation or lack of it that leads to severe drought. The development and evolution of precipitation systems are affected by heat and moisture fluxes from the land surface within weakly-sheared environments, such as in the tropics and sub-tropics. These heat and moisture fluxes during the day can be strongly influenced by land cover, vegetation, and soil moisture content. Therefore, it is important to represent the land surface state as accurately as possible in numerical weather prediction models.\nImproved modeling capabilities within the region have the potential to enhance forecast guidance in support of daily operations and high-impact weather over East Africa. KMS currently runs a configuration of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model in real time to support its daily forecasting operations, invoking the Non-hydrostatic Mesoscale Model (NMM) dynamical core. They make use of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration / National Weather Service Science and Training Resource Center's Environmental Modeling System (EMS) to manage and produce the WRF-NMM model runs on a 7-km regional grid over Eastern Africa.\nSPoRT and SERVIR provide land surface initialization datasets and model verification tool. The NASA Land Information System (LIS) provide real-time, daily soil initialization data in place of interpolated Global Forecast System soil moisture and temperature data. Model verification is done using the Model Evaluation Tools (MET) package, in order to quantify possible improvements in simulated temperature, moisture and precipitation resulting from the experimental land surface initialization. These MET tools enable KMS to monitor model forecast accuracy in near real time. This study highlights verification results of WRF runs over East Africa using the LIS land surface initialization.",

            "abstract": "Cross-correlation of the ambient seismic field is now widely applied for imaging and monitoring at many scales. This method has been quite successful in retrieving surface wave information, which can be used for estimating three-dimensional shear velocity structure, and in some cases estimating anisotropy or wave amplification and attenuation. However, the use of this approach to retrieve crustal body waves has seen less widespread use. While some studies (e.g., Zhan et al. 2010, Poli et al. 2012) have successfully recovered phases over a few hundred kilometers on continental shields, crustal body waves are not yet seen routinely over longer distances and in more structurally complex regions. In this study, we investigate the recovery of crustal body waves in the continental USA using stacked cross-correlations. The data for correlation was gathered over three to five years of continuous recording on an east-to-west line of USArray stations spanning the northern USA. Specifically, we study four parameters to determine which combination of processing produces the most robust crustal body wave estimates in this geologic setting: 1) the role of the total amount of data; 2) the influence of the length of the correlation time windows; 3) the effect of the geographic region of data collection; 4) the impact of different processes for selecting which noise windows go into the final stacks. In the last, we consider two methods to discriminate “good” and “bad” noise correlations: comparison of the amplitude of each correlation trace and matching the correlation window times with a global earthquake catalog. We are able to recover short period crustal S-wave phases at as far as 1300 kilometer interstation distances, which will provide unique information for future tomography models.",

            "abstract": "Turbulent phenomena in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) are characterized by small spatial and temporal scales which make them difficult to observe and to model.\nNew remote sensing instruments, like Doppler Lidar, give access to fine and high-frequency observations of wind in the ABL. This study suggests to use a method of nonlinear estimation based on these observations to reconstruct 3D wind in a hemispheric volume, and to estimate atmospheric turbulent parameters. The wind observations are associated to particle systems which are driven by a local turbulence model. The particles have both fluid and stochastic properties. Therefore, spatial averages and covariances may be deduced from the particles. Among the innovative aspects, we point out the absence of the common hypothesis of stationary-ergodic turbulence and the non-use of particle model closure hypothesis. Every time observations are available, 3D wind is reconstructed and turbulent parameters such as turbulent kinectic energy, dissipation rate, and Turbulent Intensity (TI) are provided.\nThis study presents some results obtained using real wind measurements provided by a five lines of sight Lidar. Compared with classical methods (e.g. eddy covariance) our technic renders equivalent long time results. Moreover it provides finer and real time turbulence estimations. To assess this new method, we suggest computing independently TI using different observation types. First anemometer data are used to have TI reference.Then raw and filtered Lidar observations have also been compared. The TI obtained from raw data is significantly higher than the reference one, whereas the TI estimated with the new algorithm has the same order.\nIn this study we have presented a new class of algorithm to reconstruct local random media. It offers a new way to understand turbulence in the ABL, in both stable or convective conditions. Later, it could be used to refine turbulence parametrization in meteorological meso-scale models.",

            "abstract": "Photosynthesis can be construed as an economic process that optimises the costs of acquisition, transport and utilisation of two substitutable photosynthetic resources: water and nitrogen. The influence of soil fertility on photosynthetic rates and leaf ‘economic’ traits related with H2O and N costs is poorly quantified in higher plants in comparison with the effects of climate. We set out to address this situation by quantifying the unique and shared contributions to global leaf-trait variation from soils and climate.\nUsing a trait dataset comprising 1509 species from 288 sites, with climate and soil data derived from global datasets, we quantified the effects of soil and climate properties on photosynthetic traits: light-saturated photosynthetic rate (Aarea), stomatal conductance to water vapour (gs), leaf N and P (Narea and Parea) and specific leaf area (SLA). We used mixed regression models, multivariate analyses and variance partitioning.\nAlong a first dimension of soil fertility, soil pH covaried positively with measures of base status and climatic aridity, and negatively with soil organic C content. Along this dimension from low to high soil pH, Narea, Parea and Aarea increased and SLA decreased.\nAlong an independent dimension of soil fertility, gs declined and Parea increased with soil available P (Pavail). Overall, soil variables were stronger predictors of leaf traits than were climate variables, except for SLA. Importantly, soils and climate were not redundant information to explain leaf trait variation but were not additive either. Shared effects of soil and climate dominated over their independent effects on Narea and Parea, while unique effects of soils dominated for Aarea and gs.\nThree environmental variables were key for explaining variation in leaf traits: soil pH and Pavail, and climatic aridity. Although the reliability of global soils datasets lags behind that of climate datasets our results nonetheless provide compelling evidence that both can now be taken into account in broad-scale analyses, and that effects uniquely attributable to soil properties are important determinants of leaf photosynthetic traits and rates. Understanding what soils tell us (that climate does not) is an important step to progress towards more reliable modelling of global vegetation function.",

These deposits record a number of massive slope failure events along the Northern Colombian Margin proximal to the actively prograding delta and fan of the Magdalena River, the 26th largest river in the world by discharge volume . The largest MTD covers an area >15,000 km2 outboard of the toe of the continental slope on the abyssal sea floor; the two smaller MTDs range from 5000 to 7000 km2 in area. The volume of the largest deposited measured from >160 km of seismic reflection data ranges from 2000 and 5000 km3, comparable in size to the giant Storegga Slide offshore Norway (3500 km3) and the Nuuanu slide offshore the island of Oahu, Hawai’i (~3000 km3). The timing of the MTDs can be constrained from sparse wells and seismic data to be mid to late Miocene (15-5.3 Ma) through the Plio-Pleistocene (2.6 Ma). Likely causative factors for the MTDs include: 1) elevated pore pressure due to generation of biogenic gas in the sediment column of the continental slopes as observed on seismic reflection data; 2) rapid sedimentation related to the Magdalena delta that has produced oversteepened slopes since the late Miocene (7-10 Ma); and 3) tectonic uplift and infrequent large earthquakes related to shallow, southeastward subduction beneath the nearby Southern Caribbean Fold Belt.

Here we present N2O stable isotopic and isotopomeric data collected during a period of high upwelling (September 2013) and low upwelling (January 2014). During both periods, 15N-nitrite and 15N-ammonium tracer inucbation experiments were used to investigate N2O production by ammonia oxidizing microorganisms in the top 150m of the water column. N2O production from 15N-ammonium was not measurable during these incubations. However, we detected N2O production from 15N-nitrite, suggesting that nitrifier denitrification is a source of shallow N2O in this region. Furthermore, decreasing the pH of the incubation water enhanced the amount of N2O produced, suggesting that upwelling of CO2-rich/low-pH deep water may enhance N2O production in this region. Finally, we present our incubation data in the larger context of the N2O and nitrite isotopic and concentration profiles, with an eye toward comparing incubation-based N2O production rates with profile-based estimates.",

On 05/01/2002, Cluster enters the distant cusp region on the duskside of the southern hemisphere (inbound). The spacecraft are successively crossing the magnetopause between 19:50 UT (SC4) and 20:15 UT (SC3). The interplanetary conditions during the crossing were stable with a dominant negative By. The magnetometer (FGM) data indicates that the entry into the cusp takes place in a region where the magnetic field lines in the magnetosheath are anti-parallel with the field lines in the magnetosphere. Despite this clear picture, the global encounter is rather complex: one can notice partial magnetopause crossings, magnetic null points, and intense monochromatic waves on both sides of the magnetopause.\nWe investigate electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves observed in the cusp and in the nearby magnetosheath, just before the magnetopause crossing by the spacecraft. Left-handed monochromatic waves observed in the cusp display different duration and frequency (below and above the local proton gyrofrequency) on each spacecraft. Both the Poynting flux of these emissions and the simultaneously recorded ion flows propagate in the same direction - toward the Earth. The wavenumber are determined in two ways: considering the Doppler shift and from direct measurements of the refractive index. We analyze these wave parameters and the local plasma conditions to explain the wave generation process on each side of the magnetopause.",

            "abstract": "Millions of hectares are burned by wildfires each year in the western US. The resulting burn scars are extremely wind erodible surfaces with high loadings of easily entrained ash and soil. Previous work has demonstrated that wind erosion from these burn scars can release large amounts of dust and ash as particulate matter (PM) into the atmosphere, resulting in large impacts on downwind air quality and visibility. Sagebrush-dominated landscapes, where often essentially all vegetation is consumed by the fire, appear to be particularly vulnerable. Climate change predictions indicate more wildfire activity in the western US and, hence, more potential for wind erosion from burn scars. However, these PM sources are not yet accounted for in regional air quality models. Here we describe a modification to the AIRPACT regional air quality modeling framework for simulating the emission, transport and dispersion of PM from post-wildfire burn scars. We present results from a 2012 sagebrush fire in southeast Oregon as a case study. Modeled PM emission rates and downwind concentrations are compared against observations for two major dust events, one which resulted in exceedances of the PM10 National Ambient Air Quality Standard in Boise, Idaho the month after the fire and another which resulted in a significant dust on snow event and subsequent snowmelt in the Owyhee Mountains of southwest Idaho the following spring. Additionally, we present model estimates of annual emissions from all wildfires that occurred in sagebrush landscapes of the western US during the 2012 fire year as an estimate of annual post-fire PM loading potential.",

            "abstract": "The phase shift and amplitude ratio of the diurnal temperature signal of paired streambed temperature sensors have already been used successfully to calculate vertical groundwater fluxes assuming a constant vertical distance between the sensors. Sedimentation and scouring however, can change the position of temperature sensors relative to the streambed influencing calculated groundwater fluxes. Here we report on a field investigation, where streambed sediment temperature time series were used to; (i) determine the range of natural sedimentation and scour over a two month period, (ii) study the influence of rain events on the calculated streambed elevation.\nThe study was carried out at a field site located along Holtum stream, in Western Denmark. The 3 m wide stream has a sandy streambed, a mean discharge of 200 l/s and a mean depth of 0.3 m. Streambed temperatures were measured at two locations in a straight stream section with a vertical high-resolution Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) system installed 0.7 m deep in the streambed. Temperature measurements were taken with 30 min intervals between 16 April and 25 June 2013 and streambed elevation was recorded on 24 May and 17 June 2013. The effective thermal diffusivity (κe ) of streambed sediments was measured on 17 June 2013 by a KD2 Pro SH-1 sensor (Decagon Devices).\nThe phase and amplitude of the diurnal temperature signal of paired sensors were extracted by VFLUX. The κe of streambed sediments was calibrated based on measured streambed elevations and validated by in-situ measurements. The range of potential streambed elevation over the two month period was calculated by assuming; (i) sedimentation, using the calibrated κe for saturated streambed sediments, (ii) scouring, using κe for stream water between the temperature sensors.\nUnder natural conditions, streambed elevation changes by 5-12 cm during the two month period and by 1-3 cm even during base flow conditions, emphasizing the importance of sensor location relative to the streambed. During rain events however, streambed elevation was overestimated by up to 8 cm due to the rain-induced disturbance in the diurnal streambed temperature signal which could potentially also lead to uncertainties in calculated groundwater fluxes.",

            "abstract": "The Oman Mountains provide the opportunity to trace evolution of deep south-eastern Tethys in successions from the Hawasina Basin, which is located adjacent to the Arabian carbonate shelf. White pelagic nannofossil limestones alternating with radiolarian chert of latest Jurassic to earliest Cretaceous age were deposited in water depth of probably more than 1000m. Carbonate turbididtes and breccias derived from the nearby Arabian shelf are intercalated with cherts and micritic limestones. Successions near the margin of the Arabian shelf were chosen for reconstruction of an Early Cretaceous carbon-isotope stratigraphy. New carbon isotope data suggest that major changes in pelagic sedimentation occurred in the Late Valanginian and in the Early Aptian. Shallowing of the CCD was caused by changes in oceanography at times of global carbon perturbations and/or by changing sea-level. In the Aptian the appearance of chert and/or highly silicified limestone coincides with a negative shift in the C-isotope values, which is interpreted as the C3-negative shift marking the base of OAE1a. Intensification of upwelling of nutrient rich water masses may explain these chert pulses during the onset of the OAE1a. Remarkable seems the observation that the Hawasina successions contain no evidence of black shale formation. The open ocean character of the easternmost Tethys (Hawasina Basin) resulted in a well-ventilated ocean circulation and therefore bottom-ocean anoxia never appeared during the Cretaceous OAE’s. Observations are in agreement with ocean circulation models (Hotinski and Toggweiler, Paleoceanography, 2003) suggesting wind driven east-west directed equatorial current combined with equatorial upwelling. These conditions were most active during extreme greenhouse conditions. Well ventilated deep-water masses of the Pacific, Indic and easternmost Tethys (Hawasina Basin) stay in contrast to the Central Tethys and also the Northern Atlantic were the global Cretaceous OAE’s commonly appear in combination with black shales.",

            "abstract": "The Biak Basin is within a frontier region, located between the islands of Biak to the north and Yapen to the south in the Indonesian province of West Papua. The Biak Basin is underlain by a Paleogene basement sequence that originated in an intra-oceanic island arc, formed on the leading edge of the oceanic Pacific-Caroline Plate. The basin has a structural history that can be divided into three stages: 1) a compressional stage, 2) a rifting stage and 3) a strike-slip stage.\nThe compressional stage occurred during the Early Miocene. Collision of the arc with the northern edge of the Australian continental margin caused folding and thrusting of the basement sequence which was uplifted and subaerially exposed resulting in a widespread unconformity that can be traced west through the western Bird’s Head as far as Halmahera.\nFollowing this collision the Biak Basin was filled largely by carbonates from the Early Miocene. During the Middle-Late Miocene the Biak Basin underwent a period of rapid subsidence resulting from a period of rifting. Extension occurred as convergence of the Pacific Plate with the Australian margin produced a regional stress field in which the maximum compressive stress was orientated NE-SW and maximum tensional stress NW-SE. This tensional stress produced NE-SW striking horsts and grabens with a Paleogene basement overlain by Lower Miocene carbonates.\nA final stage involving strike-slip faulting occurred during the Pliocene-Pleistocene with the initiation of major regional faults such as those of the Yapen Fault Zone and Biak Array which bound the southern and northeastern margins of the basin respectively. The strike-slip faulting accommodated continued convergence between the Pacific and Australian plates and uplifted Miocene carbonates as pop-up structures now observed on Biak.\nThere are parallels to the Biak Basin in basins within the Basin and Range Province of the western United States, in particular the Walker Lake Basin, Nevada and other triangular shaped basins along the Panamint Valley, California. These basins share many similarities including being bounded by NW-SE trending dextral strike-slip faults, E-W trending sinistral strike-slip faults and NE-SW trending extensional structures.",

Both analyses and forecasts of these quantities have been used separately and in combination to aid in short and medium range predictions of Earth rotation parameters. The AAM and OAM combination, with the possible addition of hydrospheric angular momentum can form a proxy index for the Earth rotation parameters themselves due to the conservation of angular momentum in the Earth system. Such a combination of angular momentum of the geophysical fluids has helped in forecasts within periods up to about 10 days, due to the dynamic models, and together with extended statistical predictions of Earth rotation parameters out even as far as 90 days, according to Dill et al.

            "abstract": "Englacial absorption of radar waves varies as a function of ice temperature and impurity content. Direct measurements of these properties are costly and time consuming, making geophysical methods for determining characteristics of the ice increasingly attractive. We examine a set of 5 common-midpoint (CMP) surveys to determine the local attenuation profiles for Kamb Ice Stream, the Whillans Ice Plain, the Whillans Grounding Zone, and the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream (NEGIS). These surveys were conducted between 2004 and 2012, using a 3 MHz radar system with dipole antennae. The results of the CMP analyses are then compared against attenuation rates estimated using a common offset profile, and once validated, we explore the possibility of using attenuation rates to infer ice properties. A borehole derived thermal profile is used to calibrate our analysis at the Whillans Ice Plain field site. If this method proves successful, it will provide a fast, low-cost means of gathering information about the thermal and chemical structure of the ice. Precise attenuation measurements are also crucial to the interpretation of reflection amplitudes in common-offset radar surveys; however, independent measures of attenuation are rarely used to correct these data. Our work suggests a way to determine those attenuation rates, thus improving our ability to make inferences about basal and internal properties from the large scale, common-offset surveys collected in Antarctica and Greenland.",

            "abstract": "This study deals with the celebrated Hershfield factor. Rainfall is typically recorded over discrete time intervals, e.g., over fixed 24-hour intervals, and thus the recorded measurements express average values over these intervals. This temporal discretization may introduce a systematic error on rainfall characteristics such as the annual maxima, which are inferred usually from records of average values. The error depends on the recording time intervals of the measurement system and on the time scale under study. For instance, Hershfield and Wilson in 1958, based on the analysis of 1-min measurements, were the first to propose a multiplier of 1.13 to correct the discretization effects on the annual daily maxima. Since then, several studies closely or approximately agree with this result. Yet all of these empirical studies are based on limited datasets in terms of number of stations and of record lengths. Furthermore, the methodological framework implemented in some studies was later questioned. Here we perform an unprecedentedly large empirical analysis of thousands of up-to-date hourly records across the US in order to quantify the effect of discretization on the rainfall maxima by assessing the Hershfield's factor value. Moreover, we further explore linkages between the Hershfield's factor and other rainfall characteristics such as the probability dry. Clarification on the effects of temporal discretization can be crucial for quantifying better rainfall extremes and for assessing their statistical behavior.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents the hypothesis that a thin spherical methane gas seam/layer exists between the crust and mantle of the Earth. This gas layer separates and protects the cold crust rocks and the hot mantle and core materials. The methane gas is produced by the mantle and core materials and is stored by the spherical trap of the compressive lower crust rock. The huge material mass of high temperature and high pressure forming the mantle and core of the Earth can have the ability to generate large amount of methane gas every day. The methane gas generated in the mantle and core has to migrate and flow upward and accumulate beneath and in the lower crust according to the second law of thermo-dynamics, where the lower crustal rock in high compression forms the primary spherical trap. The spherical dense gas layer is an ideal foundation to flexibly support, uplift and float the spherical crustal rocks. So, the crustal rocks can be stable and integrity over vast areas to form huge plates and basins and can have relative hoop movement and drifts. It is also an ideal insulation layer to prevent the crust rock from melting by the hot mantle materials and also to prevent the heat of the mantle/cores from leaking into the crust rocks and the atmosphere. As a result, the mantle/cores can keep their hot temperatures and the crust can keep their solid rocks for millions to billions years. It is estimated that the thin gas layer can have the thickness variable from several hundred meters beneath oceanic crust to a few kilometers beneath mountainous plateau continental crust. Its density is from 1000 kg/m3 to 2000 kg/m3. Accordingly, the dense methane gas mass forming the thin spherical layer can be 10 to 240 times of the air mass (5.148×1018kg) forming the atmosphere. Its leaking along deep faults or plate boundaries causes earthquakes and supplies to shallow gas and oil reservoirs beneath secondary traps in adjacent basins of the upper crustal rock mass.\n",

It is shown that the mean Fourier power spectra of emission from active region cores, above sunspots, in loop footpoints and in the quiet Sun, follow an approximate power-law behaviour. We show that power-law power-spectra can be formed by summing a distribution of exponentially decaying emission events along the line of sight, consistent with the idea that the corona is heated everywhere by small energy deposition events. We also examine changes in Fourier power spectrum as a function of coronal loop height to look for evidence of a preferred location to coronal heating. The observed power-law power spectra also have implications for coronal seismology, as all existing observational studies do not take into account the power-law power spectrum of the coronal emission and its attendant statistical properties. We show that random fluctuations in the emission can be mis-identified as oscillatory signal, and give suggestions on how to detect oscillatory motions above a background power-law power spectrum.",

            "abstract": "Exotic pest infestations are increasingly common throughout North American forests. In forested wetlands, disturbance events may alter nutrient, carbon, and hydrologic pathways. Recently, ash (Fraxinus spp.) forests in North Central and Eastern North America have been exposed to the exotic emerald ash borer (EAB) (Burprestidae: Agrilus planipennis), and the rapid and extensive expansion of EAB populations since 2001 may soon eliminate most existing ash stands. Limited research has focused on post-establishment ecosystem impacts of an EAB disturbance, and to our knowledge, there are no studies that have evaluated the coupled response of black ash (Fraxinus nigra) wetland water tables, soil temperatures, and soil gas emissions to an EAB infestation. We present preliminary results that detail those responses to a simulated EAB disturbance. Water table position, soil temperature, and soil gas emissions (CO2 and CH4) were monitored in nine black ash wetlands in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan for three years, including one year of pre-treatment and two years of post-treatment data-collection. An EAB disturbance was simulated by girdling (Girdle) or felling (Clearcut) all black ash trees with diameters of 2.5 cm or greater within the wetland, and each treatment was applied to three sites. The results indicate that wetland water tables were insensitive to treatment effects, soil temperatures were significantly higher in the Clearcut treatment, soil gas flux was significantly higher in the Clearcut treatment, and the rate of soil gas flux was strongly regulated by water table position and temperature. No significant treatment effects were detected in the Girdle treatment during the first post-treatment year. Because water tables were insensitive to treatment, we concluded that water tables did not independently generate a soil gas flux response despite their strong regulatory influence. Furthermore, we concluded that the response of soil temperature to disturbance was largely the reason why elevated soil gas flux rates were observed in the Clearcut treatment.",

GeoTASO was developed under NASA’s Instrument Incubator program and is a test-bed instrument for the Geostationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events (GEO-CAPE) decadal survey and the upcoming Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) satellite missions. The instrument collects spectra of backscattered UV-visible radiation for the detection of tropospheric trace gases such as NO2, ozone, formaldehyde and SO2. GeoTASO flew on the NASA HU-25C Falcon aircraft during the 2013 (Texas) and 2014 (Colorado) DISCOVER-AQ field campaigns, making satellite-analog measurements of trace gases at a spatial resolution of approximately 500x500 m over urban areas, power plants and other industrial sources of pollution. We present the GeoTASO retrieval algorithms, trace gas measurement results, and validation comparisons with ground-based observations and other aircraft instruments during these campaigns.",

            "abstract": "Fossil reef corals are widely used in palaeoclimate research which requires precise absolute dating. However, post-depositional open-system behaviour often causes apparently inaccurate 230Th/U-ages. We systematically tested the suitability of two different skeletal materials of eight Diploria strigosa corals from Bonaire, Netherlands Antilles, for 230Th/U-dating: (i) The commonly used bulk sample material comprised of all skeletal elements and (ii) the denser theca walls.\nThe theca walls show less diagenetic alteration. The 230Th/U-ages range from 118.9 ± 2.0 to 130.6 ± 1.2 ka. In contrast, the ages determined on the bulk material range from 112.98 ± 0.80 to 174.0 ± 2.2 ka and, thus, show substantially older and younger ages than expected for the Last Interglacial. Furthermore, for all corals, at least one of the theca sub-samples has an initial (234U/238U) activity ratio similar to the modern seawater value. For the bulk material, only 50 % of the corals show this agreement. Thus, the bulk material is obviously more prone to open-system processes. Therefore, the extraction of the theca walls from the coral skeleton considerably improves the reliability of the 230Th/U-ages.\nComparison of the bulk material with the more pristine theca walls shows that several different open-system processes affected the fossil corals. For 50 % of the corals, no significant differences in ages, activity ratios and concentrations between the two materials are observed. For three of the eight corals, the bulk samples contain considerable amounts of 232Th indicating detrital contamination, probably in combination with uranium loss. These samples also yield the oldest ages predating the beginning of the Last Interglacial by up to 35 ka. For one coral, the bulk material yields younger ages than the theca wall material. This sample also contains elevated 232Th, which again suggests detrital contamination. In addition, the coral was subject to secondary aragonite precipitation introducing additional uranium.",

            "abstract": "The LASEA 2013 cruise was executed in August 2013 in the northern margin of the Gulf of Cádiz, with the main goal of collecting data from the Guadiana River-influenced shelf, in order to: (1) study changes affecting the entire drainage basin; (2) correlate shelf unit sequences with the upper slope sedimentary record, composed dominantly of contourite deposits in specific stretches of the margin. As a first approach, attention is paid to the most obvious sedimentary manifestation of the influence of the river on the shelf domain, represented by the Guadiana incised-valley system. The database comprises both geophysical and sedimentological records. Geophysical data include multibeam bathymetry, TOPAS profiles and single-channel Sparker seismic profiles. Sedimentological data include sediment cores collected with gravity- and vibro-corer devices.\nThe lowstand erosional surface was mapped across the shelf. The lowstand surface exhibits two clearly contrasting patterns. In the outer shelf the surface isrepresented by an erosional truncation that can be planar or irregular. The lowstand surface is much more difficult to follow in the inner shelf, due to the amalgamation of erosional surfaces and the frequent stacking of coarse-grained deposits.\nIncised valleys are recognized at shallow waters (20-30 m) the most significant of them is at least 1.5 km wide in the most proximal (recognized) section, decreasing seawards in width. The internal architecture of the valley exhibits the intercalation of laterally prograding sediment bodies and high-amplitude, subparallel configurations laterally related to valley margin prograding wedges.\nThe internal facies architecture suggests a transition from relatively high-energy fluvial to proximal estuarine environment to a lower-energy estuarine depositional environment. Thus, the study of the valley extension into the shelf is expected to provide clues for the recent reorganization of the entire fluvial system, during the course of the postglacial sea-level rise and ensuing sea-level stabilization.\nAcknowledgements: this study was completed in the framework of the project CGL2011-30302-C02-02. It is also a contribution to the INQUA International Focus Group on Rapid environmental changes and human activity impacting continental shelf systems.",

            "abstract": "Our team at the National Center for Interactive Learning at the Space Science Institute has developed Starchitect, an end-to-end stellar and planetary evolution game available both on Facebook and externally. Supported by NSF and NASA, the game uses the \"sporadic play\" model of games such as Farmville, where players might only take actions a few times a day, but continue playing for months. This framework is an excellent fit for teaching about the evolution of stars and planets. Players select regions of the galaxy to build their systems, and watch as they evolve in scaled real time (a million years to the minute). Massive stars will supernova within minutes, while lower mass stars like our sun will live for weeks, possibly evolving life before passing through a red giant stage and ending their lives as white dwarfs.\nStarchitect provides a wide variety of opportunities for communicating astronomy concepts, targeting known misconceptions, and encouraging players to dig deeper through external sites. The game directly addresses stellar lifecycles, habitable zones, and the roles of giant worlds in creating habitable solar systems as part of its core design. Meanwhile minigames can focus on additional concepts. For instance, the game’s solar system visualization engine allows players to \"fake\" planetary scales to create more attractive images of their systems (which can then be posted to their Facebook wall), but this ability must be unlocked through completion of a minigame that looks at the relative scales of planets, moons, and solar system distances. Starchitect also incorporates current science through links to external content, science \"Factlets\", all-sky maps generated by missions, and more. Finally, the game is heavily instrumented to allow us to analyze the resulting gameplay in conjunction with Facebook’s demographic data.\nThis presentation will focus on the release, evaluation, and ongoing refinement of the game as well as its overall goals, which include reaching a broad audience with basic astronomy concepts as well as current science results; exploring the potential of social, “sporadic play” games in education; and determining if platforms such as Facebook allow us to reach significantly different demographics than are generally targeted by educational games.",

            "abstract": "Simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium with a cloud-system resolving model are used to investigate the behavior of moist convection over a wide range of surface temperatures. We examine high percentiles of the simulated precipitation distribution (precipitation extremes). For surface temperatures above roughly 295 K, precipitation extremes increase with warming in proportion to the increase in surface moisture, following what is termed Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) scaling. At lower temperatures, however, the rate of increase of precipitation extremes with warming is sensitive to the choice of cloud and precipitation microphysics scheme used, and it differs markedly from CC scaling in some cases. Precipitation extremes are found to be sensitive to the fall speeds of hydrometeors, and this partly explains the different scaling results obtained with different microphysics schemes.\nThe choice of microphysics scheme also influences other aspects of the simulations, such as the top-of-atmosphere radiation budget, and these sensitivities are briefly discussed. The results highlight the challenges of representing sub-grid scale processes in climate models, even as increasing computational resources begin to allow climate simulations at near cloud-resolving resolution.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric aerosol over South Asia has attracted increasing concern over the recent decades due to its significant effects on air quality and climate. However the aerosol properties over South Asia has been poorly represented in most global models, with the surface concentrations, aerosol optical depth (AOD), and absorbing AOD (AAOD) significantly underestimated, especially in October-January when the agricultural waste burning and anthropogenic aerosol dominates over dust aerosol. This study investigates the causes for such discrepancy by conducting a series of model sensitivity experiments with NASA’s GEOS-5 model with results evaluated with satellites, AERONET and in-situ measurements. The primary objectives of our research are to examine: 1) whether the aerosol sources (especially anthropogenic) used in the model are underestimated; 2) whether the meteorological conditions (such as relative humidity) are poorly represented in the model; 3) whether the commonly used spatial resolution in the current global models is inadequate to resolve the aerosol distributions features in South Asia. Results from this study will contribute to our understanding of key factors to determine the aerosol distribution over South Asia, and providing insights on improving aerosol representation in global models.",

            "abstract": "Since the earthquake rupture process is extremely heterogeneous, it is vital to understand how structural variations in the overriding plate and downgoing slab may control slip style along the subduction megathrust. The large-scale 3-D geometry of subduction plate boundaries is rapidly becoming well understood; however, the nature of any finer-scale structure along the plate interface remains elusive. A detailed study of earthquake source mechanisms along a megathrust region can shed light on the nature of fine-scale structures along the megathrust.\nThe Mw 8.8 Maule earthquake that struck central Chile in 2010 is the sixth largest earthquake ever recorded. Following the earthquake, there was an international deployment of seismic stations in the rupture area, making this one of the best datasets of an aftershock sequence following a large earthquake. This dataset provides a unique opportunity to perform a detailed study of megathrust earthquake source mechanisms.\nBased on a high-resolution 3-D velocity model and robust earthquake locations [Hicks et al., 2014], we calculate regional moment tensors using the ISOLA software package [Sokos & Zahradnik, 2008]. We incorporate accelerometer recordings, important for constraining solutions of large earthquakes in the overriding plate. We also validate the robustness of our solutions by assessing the consistency of mechanisms with P-wave polarities observed at both onshore and offshore seismic stations, and compare them to already published solutions. We find that accurate earthquake locations are vital for the fine-scale interpretation of focal mechanisms, particularly for offshore events.\nOur results show that most moment tensor solutions with thrusting mechanisms have a nodal plane dipping parallel to the subducting plate interface. Interestingly, we also find earthquakes with normal faulting mechanisms lying along to the megathrust plate interface in the south of the rupture area. This finding suggests that megathrust slip style can be highly variable across the megathrust, with implications for fault processes such as postseismic fluid release. We also perform 3-D full waveform forward simulation using the spectral element code, SPECFEM3D, to understand the sensitivity of our moment tensor solutions with respect to 3-D velocity structure.",

            "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that saline submarine groundwater discharges from the seafloor in volumes that rival river discharge, but this discharge occurs far from shore, spread regionally across the continental shelves. The very limited observational data suggest that saline discharge occurs via long-term regional flow systems and rapid flushing of porewaters from sandy sediment during storm events. This study aims to overcome the paucity of available observational constraints on characterizing regional-scale fluid exchange on passive margin continental shelves. We are developing a detailed hydrostratigraphic framework based on 200 km of CHIRP seismic lines 5-20 km offshore from Charleston, SC and 13 sediment cores up to 6.5 m long. This survey revealed varying thicknesses (0-15 m) of sediment overlying Cretaceous limestone basement, and a filled paleochannel fluvial system. We have installed 3 sets of nested wells and an additional 10 temperature-gradient arrays to observe a wide variety of environments across the shelf. The wells and thermal arrays have been recently installed in the upper 5 m of the sediment, to allow monitoring of pressure and temperature. The wells will also be sampled for Ra tracers and nutrient concentrations. The combination of wells and survey data will allow us to estimate rates of submarine groundwater discharge via hydraulic gradients and by using heat and geochemical tracers. We have developed a numerical model to invert thermal data to estimate both long-term regional groundwater flow and rapid flushing associated with storm events.",

            "abstract": "A physical basis for transporting magnitude (M) versus yield (W) relationships between test sites is essential for improved yield estimation. A case in point is an Ms relationship transported from the Nevada Test Site, which gives W estimates of North Korean tests roughly a factor of two larger than mb-based estimates. In order to test the performance of this relation, we transport it to Semipalatinsk (STS) where W and source media information are available. The transported Ms – W relation was developed for water-saturated tuff/rhyolite, and Rayleigh-wave generation was corrected for the effects of source medium compaction due to spall slapdown. Coupling variations with burial depth and the effects of compaction, both functions of W in tuff/rhyolite, are mitigated for shots in hard rock. As such, it is satisfying that Ms for STS shots are seen to scale similarly as the transported relation, ~0.8log[W]. However, they are offset downward by 0.4 - 0.5 magnitude units. A negative offset is consistent with the effects of tectonic release, but research has shown the inadequacy of double-couple (DC) mechanisms to improve correlations of moment magnitude Mw – W relations. Source medium properties are not a factor because larger amplitude Green’s functions in weak rock trade off with reduced source strength relative to explosions in hard rock. In this paper, the role of late-time damage due to non-linear, free-surface interactions, modeled with an Mzz source, is explored. Combining this source with DC mechanisms, we show the non-uniqueness of models to satisfy long-period surface-wave observations, and investigate overcoming this difficulty with full waveform modeling of Borovoye seismograms.",

            "abstract": "Large-eddy simulations (LES) have been successfully utilized in many atmospheric turbulence studies. In LES, grid spacing acts like a low-pass filter such that flow features larger than the grid spacing can be resolved, whereas the effects of smaller, sub-grid scale (SGS) eddies are modeled. Therefore, a well-designed SGS model plays a vital role in a successful LES. One of the most sophisticated SGS models is the Lagrangian scale-dependent (LASD) model, in which the scale-dependence of the Smagorinsky coefficient CS is taken into account by performing two explicit filtering processes with different filter widths. Then Lagrangian averaging in time along flow trajectories is used to eliminate the numerical instability caused by backscattering. The LASD model has been successfully implemented in atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) studies using the spectral/pseudo-spectral methods. However, it has not been coupled with finite-difference methods.\nIn this study, the finite-difference method is used for the first time in LES of the ABL using an LASD subgrid scale model. First, a-posteriori tests with a fully conservative 4th-order scheme are performed by simulating turbulent channel flows with . Vertical profiles of mean wind velocity, turbulence intensity, and momentum fluxes, and 1-D spectra of streamwise velocity are compared to those from an existing direct numerical simulation (DNS) database. Several different SGS models are compared and a sensitivity test of spatial resolution is also performed. Second, LES of a neutral ABL with (i.e., molecular viscosity is negligible) are performed using the same numerical methods. The classic logarithmic profile of the streamwise velocity in the inertial subrange is examined in particular. Third, the numerical methods are extended to LES of a stable ABL where the buoyancy effect is considered by using the Boussinesq approximation. The SGS heat flux is calculated via an LASD model similar to that for the SGS stress. The results are compared to the GEWCE Atmospheric Boundary Layer Study (GABLS) database.",

            "abstract": "Recent work in the Galapagos Islands suggests that noble gas temperatures (NGTs) in fractured groundwater systems reflect the temperature of the ground surface at the time of infiltration rather than the mean annual air temperature (MAAT) value as commonly assumed in sedimentary systems where NGTs are typically used as indicators of past climate. This suggests that noble gases in fractured areas may record seasonality, and thus, provide information about timing of recharge in addition to location. Calculation of NGTs assumes that rain-derived recharge at the water table is in equilibrium with ground air. Lack of noble gas equilibration with respect to surface conditions, however, was observed in high-altitude springs in the Galapagos Islands and in a rainwater pilot study in Michigan, supporting the NGT seasonality hypothesis. Developing this new NGT application will lead to a better understanding of fractured groundwater flow systems and will contribute to improved water resource management plans.\nThis study, carried out on Maui, Hawaii, is meant to test these hypotheses while improving knowledge of this island’s groundwater flow system where limited hydrologic data are available. Here, we present the first results of noble gas analyses from samples collected in springs, groundwater wells and rainwater on northeast Maui. Results show that like most Michigan rainwater samples, rainwater from Maui is in disequilibrium with surface conditions and follows a mass-dependent pattern. Spring samples follow a similar pattern to that of rainwater and suggest that spring water originates directly from rainfall. These findings further support the hypothesis of NGT seasonality. However, while the atmospheric composition of noble gases points to direct supply from rainfall to spring aquifer systems, a direct connection between spring water and deeper aquifer levels or the mantle is apparent from He isotopic ratios which display an almost pure He mantle component in some springs.",

            "abstract": "One of the main objectives of International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 349 was to constrain the age of the initiation and termination of seafloor spreading in the South China Sea (SCS) basin. Expedition 349 drilled three sites (U1431, U1433, and U1434) into the basaltic crustal basement near the fossil spreading center in the East and Southwest Subbasins. Shipboard biostratigraphic analysis of microfossils from the sediment immediately above or between flows in the basaltic basement indicates early Miocene ages: 16.7–17.6 Ma for Site U1431 in the East Subbasin and ~18–21 Ma for Site U1433 in the Southwest Subbasin. The similarity in preliminary crustal age between sites suggests a similar age for the cessation of spreading in both the East and Southwest Subbasins. This observation rules out some of the tectonic models for the opening of the SCS in which the Southwest Subbasin was older than the East Subbasin. Expedition 349 also drilled Site U1435 on a bathymetric high along the northwestern continent-ocean boundary. Onboard core description, biostratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy revealed that sediment at this site shows a sharp discontinuity at about 33 Ma, with shallow-water sandstones and mudstones of unknown age below the disconformity and deep-water marine deposits above. We infer that this represents the transition from breakup to the beginning of oceanic spreading. The oceanic seafloor spreading in the SCS, from 33 to ~16-18 Ma, is thus coeval with a large part of the left-lateral motion along the Ailao Shan-Red River Fault Zone (dated 34 to 17 Ma). Through the calibration of magnetic anomaly models, the expedition results will therefore permit a better reconstruction of the spreading history of the basin. We use the age constraints provided by the biostratigraphic, magnetostratigraphic and radiometric dating analyses to build new synthetic profiles and identify magnetic anomalies in the SCS. A compilation of this new data with existing magnetic anomaly data allows us to trace isochrons through most of the East and the Southwest Subbasins.",

            "abstract": "The anaerobic oxidation of ammonium with nitrite (anammox) has been identified as a very important fixed nitrogen (N) sink, accounting for a large fraction of global fixed N loss in marine, freshwater, and semi-terrestrial environments. In engineered systems, combined nitritation-anammox is an efficient process to remove N from ammonium-rich wastewater, with nitrite as the central intermediate. During the anammox process, nitrate is being produced, providing reducing equivalents for carbon fixation. Measuring the N isotope ratios in fixed N species (i.e., ammonium, nitrite, nitrate) has proven to be a valuable tool to track N cycling in freshwater and marine ecosystems, yet its application in wastewater treatment as a tool to diagnose nitrate production pathways is novel. In this presentation we will elucidate, and compare, the N isotope effects associated with anammox 1) in vitro, 2) in a lacustrine setting, and 3) in a small-scale batch reactor for wastewater treatment. We demonstrate that the anammox nitrite/nitrate isotopic signatures are modulated by the superposition of strong kinetic (normal and inverse) and equilibrium (nitrite-nitrate) N isotope fractionation. The ammonium N isotope effect is driven by kinetic N isotope fractionation, and is similar to that of nitrification. We will discuss the possible controls on the expression of the anammox N isotope effects in the natural environment. We will also evaluate the use of nitrate/nitrite N (and O) isotope signatures to distinguish between nitrate production by anammox versus nitrite oxidation, which is important for optimizing process efficiency during wastewater treatment.",

            "abstract": "The uneven Earth's spinning has been reported to affect geological processes, i.e. tectonism, seismicity and volcanism, on a planetary scale. Here we show that changes of the length of day (LOD) influence eruptive activity at subduction margins. Statistical analysis indicates that eruptions with Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI)≥3 alternate along opposite subduction zones as a function of whether the LOD increases or decreases. In particular eruptions in volcanic arcs along contractional subduction zones, which are mostly E- or NE-directed, occur when the LOD increases, whereas they are more frequent in backarc extensional settings along W-directed subduction zones when the LOD decreases. We infer that the LOD variability determines a modulation of the horizontal shear stresses acting on the crust-lithosphere. An increase of the horizontal maximum stress in compressive regimes during LOD increment may favour the rupture of the magma feeder system wall-rocks. Similarly, a decrease of the minimum horizontal stress in the back arc extensional settings during LOD lowering generates a larger differential stress, which may enhance failure of the magma confining rocks. This asymmetric behaviour of magmatism contributes to the knowledge of the role of astronomical forces on the dynamics of the solid Earth.",

            "abstract": "A variety of studies, including multiple NRC (National Research Council) reports, have stressed the need for simulation models that can provide realistic predictions of contaminant behavior during the groundwater remediation process, most recently highlighting the specific technical challenges of “back diffusion and desorption in plume models”. For a typically-sized remediation site, a minimum of about 70 million grid cells are required to achieve desired cm-level thickness among low-permeability lenses responsible for driving the back-diffusion phenomena. Such discretization is nearly three orders of magnitude more than is typically seen in modeling practice using public domain codes like RT3D (Reactive Transport in Three Dimensions). Consequently, various extensions have been made to the RT3D code to support efficient modeling of recently proposed dual-mode non-linear sorption processes (e.g. Polanyi with linear partitioning) at high-fidelity scales of grid resolution. These extensions have facilitated development of exploratory models in which contaminants are introduced into an aquifer via an extended multi-decade “release period” and allowed to migrate under natural conditions for centuries. These realistic simulations of contaminant loading and migration provide high fidelity representation of the underlying diffusion and sorption processes that control remediation. Coupling such models with decision support processes is expected to facilitate improved long-term management of complex remediation sites that have proven intractable to conventional remediation strategies.",

            "abstract": "Salt marsh ecosystems face a variety of anthropogenic stressors, including rising temperature, increasing rate of relative sea level rise, changing sediment loads, and increasing nitrogen loads. In this study, we focus on the role of increased temperatures in altering net greenhouse gas fluxes (CO2, CH4, N2O) in a relatively undisturbed New England salt marsh (Waquoit Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, USA). Salt marshes are considered large net sinks of carbon (C), due in part to the high rates of primary production and relatively slow decomposition rates. However, increased temperature as a result of climate change may alter the net carbon balance of these ecosystems, due to changes in relative rates of respiration and photosynthesis. In addition to altering the net C balance, nitrous oxide (N2O) is produced in part via microbially-mediated processes that also respond to temperature (e.g. nitrification, denitrification). Thus, we hypothesize that higher temperatures may increase the fluxes of this potent GHG from marshes to the atmosphere. To examine the role of warming in altering net GHG fluxes, we installed six open-top-chambers (OTCs) in both the high and low marsh during July of 2014. We used the cavity ring-down spectroscopy method (Picarro and LGR) to measure in-situ fluxes of CO2, CH4, N2O monthly in light and dark conditions. We will present data demonstrating that our OTCs successfully warmed the air temperature in the plots at least 5 ˚C and evaluate how this temperature increase altered GHG net ecosystem exchange in the marsh.",

Using a fully kinetic model including the effect of Coulomb collisions, the expansion of the solar wind, as well as the self consistent large scale electric field needed to preserve quasi neutrality and zero current, we indeed observe the electron heat flux in very good agreement with observations. However, closer inspection of the heat flux properties, such as its dependence on the thermodynamic quantities and its variation with the distance, shows that for Knudsen number between 0.02 and 0.3 the heat flux is still not conveniently described by the Spitzer-Härm formula. Moreover, the good agreement between our model - that does not include wave-particle interactions - and the heat flux in the solar wind in the high Knudsen regime suggests that at 1AU the heat flux intensity is not constrained by electromagnetic instabilities, wave-particle and wave-wave interactions.",

            "abstract": "Can magnetite be a stable phase in the lithospheric mantle? Equilibrium-based thermodynamic calculations and petrologic models predict that it should not be stable. Studies of mantle xenoliths during the 1980s concluded that even though there were rare exceptions, mantle rocks do not host sufficient concentrations of ferromagnetic minerals and are too hot to allow any magnetic remanence. Thus, conventional wisdom dictates that the Moho constitutes a fundamental magnetic boundary. Yet, growing evidence from a more complete global mantle xenolith survey indicates the presence of ferromagnetic minerals in mantle materials. Examination of mantle xenoliths devoid of serpentinization and meteoric alteration show the presence of ferromagnetic minerals within primary silicate mineral phases, including olivine, pyroxene, and spinel. Nucleation of these magnetic minerals could occur at three different stages: in-situ in the mantle, upon ascent, and at the surface. This study reports the results of laboratory-based quasi-adiabatic decompression experiments that aim to simulate the ascent of mantle xenoliths through the lithosphere and test if magnetite growth is promoted during the process.\nThe starting material for these experiments is San Carlos olivine, which holds a magnetic remanence of less than ~10-10 A/m2-1kg2 (the detection limit of the vibrating sample magnetometer). This low starting remanence will allow us to identify whether new magnetic minerals are formed during the decompression experiments using either vibrating sample magnetometry or SQUID-based rock magnetometers. All olivine grains in these experiments were hand-picked under a light microscope in an effort to avoid the inclusion of grains with spurious magnetic minerals. Olivine powders from these carefully selected grains will be used to represent average mantle olivine compositions (Fo90-Fo92). Experiments will start at 1 GPa and be decompressed to 0.3 GPa over 60 hrs at constant temperature (1200° C). These experiments will provide an assessment of the stability of magnetic mineral assemblages within the mantle, unfettered by the effects of serpentinization and surficial oxidation, which in turn will better inform our understanding of long wavelength magnetic anomalies in the Earth.",

            "abstract": "During summer, the weather disturbances over the eastern Tibetan Plateau (ETP) can initiate development of severe weather system downstream, causing flooding in East Asia. Previous studies yielded inconsistent results on the intraseasonal variability of summer rainfall in terms of periodicity, genesis process and propagation pathway, due to data paucity over the EPT. In this study, we detected two dominant peaks, centered on 10 (8–12) days and 19 (14–24) days using daily rainfall data over the ETP during the period of 1992–2007. Composite analysis revealed that the two modes with different periodicity were predominantly produced by the non-stationary wave trains in the upper troposphere, which traveled along different pathways. For the 19-day mode, the wave train featured a southeastward migration, originating in the Barents Sea and traveling via the East European Plain, the Ural Mountains, Lake Balkhash and Lake Baikal, the Mongolian Plateau, and then continued southward to the ETP and South Asia. In contrast, the 10-day wave train propagated eastward along the westerly jet, extending from the eastern North Atlantic via the Mediterranean, Black and Caspian seas towards the ETP, East Asia and Southeast China. These two transient wave trains took place on different large-scale background circulations: a meridional pattern with a “Giant Ural Mountain Ridge” for the 19-day mode and a zonal pattern with “Western Siberian Trough” for the 10-day mode. In terms of simultaneous downstream linkage, the ETP rainfall anomaly was in-phase with the rainfall anomaly over the Yangtze River Basin for the 19-day mode but out-of-phase with the 10-day mode. The major processes generating the local wet spells for the two modes were found to be commonly linked to topographic lift and mid-tropospheric latent heat release, but the moisture sources are somewhat different. The evolution of the intraseasonal variability over the ETP described here may provide a useful guidance for 2–3 week (extended range) forecasts over the ETP and its downstream regions. ",

            "abstract": "In many areas, drought is expected to occur more frequently and intensely in the future due to climate change; however, drought effects on ecosystem-scale fluxes in diverse forests will reflect the diversity of water use strategies among the dominant tree species. For three years (2011-2013) that included a severe drought event (in 2012), we measured the sap flow densities along the sapwood profiles (four radial depths: 1, 2, 3, 4 cm) in Acer saccharum, Liriodendron tulipifera, and Quercus spp. using the compensation heat pulse technique at the Morgan-Monroe State Forest (Indiana, USA). Sap flow velocity varies along the radial profile of the stem, and thus characterizing its pattern is important for estimating whole tree sap flow, and for characterizing the extent to which water stress alters the radial pattern of flow. We also focused on the nocturnal sap flow, which may be used to replenish stored water depleted during the daytime, in order to assess the extent to which the three species rely on hydraulic capacitance to cope with water stress. Sap flow densities along the sapwood profile of all three species tended to increase toward the cambium under moderate climate, while the tendency was reversed under severe drought. This shift may indicate greater reliance on stored water in the inner sapwood or cavitation of outer sapwood during the drought. It was also noticeable that Quercus spp. showed lower maximum sap flow density and narrower range (1.5 - 4.6 cm h-1) than other species (A. saccharum: 1.0 – 20.8 cm h-1, L. tulipifera: < 0.1 – 45.2 cm h-1) during 3 years of measurements. In addition, nocturnal/diurnal ratios of volumetric sap flows were significantly higher in the drought year for A. saccharum (0.140.01 in 2011 and 0.200.01 in 2013 vs. 0.290.01 in 2012) and L. tulipifera (0.140.00 in 2011 and 0.090.01 in 2013 vs. 0.300.01 in 2012), while Quercus spp. didn’t show a significant difference between moderate and drought years. This may be due to the replenishment of stored water of A. saccharum and L. tulipifera that was lost during the daytime. These results implied different strategies among the species to reduce water loss under drought conditions; with A. saccharum and L. tulipifera apparently relying on more conservative approaches that depend on the use of stored water.",

The current 1-dimensional constrained variational analysis (1D CVA) method (Zhang and Lin, 1997) used by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program is limited to represent the average of a sounding network domain. We extended the original 1D CVA algorithm into 3-dimensional along with other improvements, calculated gridded large-scale forcing data, apparent heating sources (Q1) and moisture sinks (Q2), and compared with 5 reanalyses: ERA-Interim, NCEP CFSR, MERRA, JRA55 and NARR for a mid-latitude spring cyclone case. The results from a case study for in March 3rd 2000 at the Southern Great Plain (SGP) show that reanalyses generally captured the structure of the mid-latitude cyclone, but they have serious biases in the 2nd order derivative terms (divergences and horizontal derivations) at regional scales of less than a few hundred kilometers. Our algorithm provides a set of atmospheric fields consistent with the observed constraint variables at the surface and top of the atmosphere better than reanalyses. The analyzed atmospheric fields can be used in SCM, CRM and LES to provide 3-dimensional dynamical forcing, or be used to evaluate reanalyses or model simulations.",

Based on the analysis of topography and spatial vegetation patterns, a distributed eco-hydrological model was developed and applied to the upper Heihe River basin which was a typical inland basin in Northwest China. Interaction between the vegetation dynamics, hillslope hydrological processes and frozen soil processes were described in the model. A method using the ”subbasin-flow interval-grid-hillslope” system was developed for catchment discretization. Hillslope was the basic unit for eco-hydrological simulation. Key eco-hydrological processes includes vegetation growth, evaporation, infiltration, soil moisture move, groundwater flow and surface flow were simulated on the hillslope. Numerical simulation experiment showed that topography parameterization significantly influenced the eco-hydrological simulation. Concave hillslopes lead to larger flood peaks then linear hillslopes. Spatial variability of radiation due to the variability of slope and aspect played on important role in energy and water balance. Frozen soil changes and vegetation changes showed large effects the hydrological process.",

            "abstract": "The role of the Tibetan Plateau in the South Asian Monsoon circulation is the focus of this study. Typically, the Tibetan Plateau is thought to affect the circulation by acting as an elevated heat source (Molnar et al. 1993). Through radiative effects, the Tibetan Plateau would induce a meridional pressure gradient at upper levels initiating the monsoon circulation. Indeed, numerical experiments have shown that global orography affects the timing of the monsoon onset (Chakraborty et al. 2006), and observations have shown significant correlations between the moist static energy of the Tibetan Plateau’s lower atmosphere and the summer monsoon rainfall around the onset and withdraw periods (Rajagopalan and Molnar 2013). Yet, this notion has been recently questioned, and the shielding effect of the orography has been suggested to be the dominant effect in the circulation. This latter theory is supported by numerical experiments suggesting that summer precipitation does not change considerably when removing the Plateau while retaining the Himalayas (Boos and Kuang 2010). Nonetheless, both the Himalayas and the Plateau are likely to play important roles, and further experiments are needed.\nIn this study we construct numerical experiments to further study the role of the Tibetan Plateau in the atmospheric circulation. For the experiments we use SPEEDY, a global climate model of intermediate complexity developed at the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (Molteni 2003). The experiments are conducted with different regional orographic conditions, so that we can evaluate the impact orography has in determining the characteristics of the monsoon circulation. In all experiments the atmosphere is started from a state of rest and we avoid using climatological fields for sea surface temperature, diabatic heating, and land temperature. This setup is particularly important as we wish to evaluate how the system evolves under different conditions without imposing a climatological solution to any field. The importance rests in the fact that these fields are determined by the dynamics of the coupled system and might influence how the statistics of the system, such as the mean onset dates of the monsoon or the climatological distribution of rainfall, vary with changes in orography.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic plumes produced by explosive eruptions commonly interact with atmospheric wind causing plume bending and a reduction of its maximum height. Strength of the wind field and intensity of the eruption control the behavior of the column in the atmosphere, which may form either a strong plume that is little affected by the presence of wind or a weak plume that is bent-over in the wind field. To better understand the transition between weak and strong plumes, we present a series of new laboratory reproducing a buoyant jet rising in a stratified environment with a uniform cross-flow. The experiments consist in injecting downward fresh water in a tank containing an aqueous NaCl solution with linear density stratification. The jet source is towed at a constant speed through the stationary fluid in order to produce a cross-flow. We show that depending on the environmental and source conditions, the buoyant jet may form either a strong, distorted, or weak plume. The transition from one dynamical regime to another is governed by the strength of the horizontal wind velocity compared to the vertical buoyant rise of the plume. A review of field data on historical eruptions confirms that the experimentally-determined transition curves capture the behavior of volcanic columns. We quantify the impact of wind on the maximum height reached by the column, and we propose a universal scaling relationship to link the mass discharge rate feeding an eruption to its observed maximum height in the presence of wind.",

            "abstract": "Carbonaceous components and soluble ions of PM2.5 were measured at Ieodo Ocean Research Station (IORS) from December 2004 to June 2008. IORS is a 40-m research tower and located in the East China Sea (32.07°N, 125.10°E). As IORS is distanced equally from South Korea, China, and Japan, it is an ideal place to monitor Asian outflows with the least influence of local emissions. The mean concentration of PM2.5 mass was 21.8 ± 14.9 μg/m3 with the maximum of 35.3 μg/m3 (March) and the minimum of 11.2 μg/m3 (September). The monthly variation of PM2.5 mass was similar to that of O3 due to meteorological conditions, which determines the degree of influence from nearby lands. Chinese outflows were mostly responsible for the enhancement of mass and major constituents of PM2.5 such as sulfate, OC, and EC. Their concentrations were the lowest in summer when aged marine air masses were dominant. It is noteworthy that sulfate was also enhanced when air mass passed through Japan, even though its concentration was not as high as that of Chinese outflows. In June, OC concentration was distinctively high with high OC/EC ratio of ~9.5. At IORS, June is characterized by the most frequent occurrence of fog and the lowest visibility with the highest relative humidity. In China, the clearing fire of agricultural residues is the major source of fine aerosols in June, leading to severe haze (e.g., Cheng et al., 2014). In addition, the aerosol optical depth was also observed to be the maximum over northeast Asia in June (Kim et al., 2007). Consequently, our results suggest that organic aerosol played a critical role in fog formation in the study region.\n\n",

However, secondary environmental and biological factors modify the net apparent fractionation between precipitation δD and leaf wax δD, limiting quantitative reconstruction of paleohydrology. These secondary factors include soil evaporation, leaf transpiration, biosynthetic fractionation, and the seasonal timing of lipid synthesis. Here, we investigate the influence of each of these factors on n-alkyl lipid δD in five dominant deciduous angiosperm tree species as well as shrubs, ferns and grasses in the watershed surrounding Brown’s Lake Bog, Ohio, USA. We quantified n-alkane and n-alkanoic acid concentrations and δD in replicate individuals of each species at weekly to monthly intervals from March to October 2014 to assess inter- and intraspecific isotope variability throughout the growing season. We present soil, xylem and leaf water δD from each individual, and precipitation and atmospheric water vapor δD throughout the season to directly examine the relationship between source water and lipid isotope composition. These data allow us to assess the relative influence of soil evaporation and leaf transpiration among plant types, within species, and along a soil moisture gradient throughout the catchment. We use leaf water δD to approximate biosynthetic fractionation for each individual and test whether this is a species-specific and seasonal constant, and to evaluate variation among plant types with identical growth conditions. Our high frequency sampling approach provides new insights into the seasonal timing of n-alkane and n-alkanoic acid synthesis and subsequent fluctuations in concentration and δD in a temperate deciduous forest. These results will advance understanding of the magnitude and timing of secondary influences on the modern leaf wax δD signal, thereby improving paleohydrology information extracted from leaf wax δD.",

            "abstract": "The choice of hydrologic model structures is one of the sources of uncertainty in representing hydrological process. In most applications, a single comprehensive hydrologic model structure might not be able to capture the entire complex and multi-scale interactions among the different components of the hydrologic process adequately. Calibrating such model can result in displacement of errors from structure to parameters, which in turn leads to over-correction and biased parameter values. An alternative to a single model structure is to develop local expert structures that are well suited in representing specific components of the hydrologic system and adaptively integrate them based on an indicator state variable. In this study, the Hierarchical Mixture of Experts (HME) architecture with a modified gating network function is applied to integrate two runoff module structures of the HBV model. The runoff module structures (i.e., buckets number and orientation) are proposed based on their expertise in representing recession flow and flow duration curve. This process based diagnostic framework of local experts provides a skilled platform for HME to effectively capture each distinct characteristic of the hydrograph and stochastically adapt to catchment response through soil moisture as an indicator variable. The approach is tested using two previously studied catchments, the Guadalupe River (Texas) and the French Broad River (North Carolina) from the Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX). The results show that the HME approach has a better performance over a single model for both catchments in terms of the Nash Sutcliffe and correlation coefficient. Furthermore, we have developed and applied a comprehensive performance assessment matrix based on information theory to evaluate the differences between model and observation in terms of different characteristics of the hydrograph.",

            "abstract": "Bacterial sulfate reduction is responsible for the majority of anaerobic methane oxidation in modern marine sediments. This sulfate-driven AOM can often metabolize all the methane produced within marine sediments, preventing any from reaching the overlying ocean. In certain areas, however, methane concentrations are high enough to form bubbles, which can reach the seafloor, only partially metabolized through sulfate-driven AOM; these areas where methane bubbles into the ocean are called cold seeps, or methane seeps. We use the sulfur and oxygen isotopes of sulfate (d34SSO4 and d18OSO4) in locations where sulfate-driven AOM is occurring both in methane seeps as well as lower flux methane transition zones to show that in methane seeps, the d34SSO4 and d18OSO4 data during the coupled sulfate reduction fall into a very narrow range and with a close to linear relationship (slope 0.37± 0.01 (R^2= 0.98, n=52, 95% confidence interval). In the studied environments, considerably different physical properties exist, excluding the possibility that this linear relationship can be attributed to physical processes such as diffusion, advection or mixing of two end-members. This unique isotopic signature emerges during bacterial sulfate reduction by methane in ‘cold’ seeps and differs when sulfate is reduced by either organic matter oxidation or by a slower, diffusive flux of methane within marine sediments. We show also that this unique isotope fingerprint is preserved in the rock record in authigenic build-ups of carbonates and barite associated with methane seeps, and may serve as a powerful tool for identifying catastrophic methane release in the geological record.",

            "abstract": "Geographically isolated wetlands (GIWs), typically defined as depressional wetlands surrounded by uplands, support an array of hydrological and ecological processes. However, key research questions concerning the hydrological connectivity of GIWs and their impacts on downgradient surface waters remain unanswered. This is particularly important for regulation and management of these systems. For example, in the past decade United States Supreme Court decisions suggest that GIWs can be afforded protection if significant connectivity exists between these waters and traditional navigable waters. Here we developed a simulation procedure to quantify the effects of various spatial distributions of GIWs across the landscape on the downgradient hydrograph using a refined version of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a catchment-scale hydrological simulation model. We modified the SWAT FORTRAN source code and employed an alternative hydrologic response unit (HRU) definition to facilitate an improved representation of GIW hydrologic processes and connectivity relationships to other surface waters, and to quantify their downgradient hydrological effects. We applied the modified SWAT model to an ~ 202 km2 catchment in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina, USA, exhibiting a substantial population of mapped GIWs. Results from our series of GIW distribution scenarios suggest that: (1) Our representation of GIWs within SWAT conforms to field-based characterizations of regional GIWs in most respects; (2) GIWs exhibit substantial seasonally-dependent effects upon downgradient base flow; (3) GIWs mitigate peak flows, particularly following high rainfall events; and (4) The presence of GIWs on the landscape impacts the catchment water balance (e.g., by increasing groundwater outflows). Our outcomes support the hypothesis that GIWs have an important catchment-scale effect on downgradient streamflow.",

            "abstract": "Space-based lidar missions targeting greenhouse gases are expected to close observational gaps, e.g., over subarctic permafrost and tropical wetlands, where in-situ and passive remote sensing techniques have difficulties. In the frame of a joint climate monitoring initiative, a “Methane Remote Lidar Mission” (MERLIN) was proposed by the German and French space agencies DLR and CNES. MERLIN is now in Phase B, in which all mission components are planned in detail. Launch is foreseen in 2019. The instrument is an integrated path differential absorption (IPDA) lidar which, installed on a low earth orbit platform provided by CNES, uses the surface backscatter to measure the atmospheric methane column. The globally observed concentration gradients will primarily help inverse numerical models to better infer regional methane fluxes. The lidar signals are able to travel through optically thin cloud and aerosol layers without producing a bias, and MERLIN’s small field of view, of order 100 m, is expected to provide observations in broken cloud environments, often encountered in the tropics.\nAs IPDA is a novel technique, calibration and validation will be essential. It is foreseen to validate MERLIN by under-flying the satellite with another IPDA lidar, CHARM-F, and a passive remote sensor, both airborne. However, active and passive remote sensors have different, pressure and temperature dependent measurements sensitivities (weighting functions), different fields of view, and do not sample the total methane column on-board an aircraft. Furthermore, since the methane profile is not constant, its column depends on the height of the boundary layer and of the tropopause. We investigate the impact of these issues on the expected validation accuracy, and we examine whether the ground-based Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) may be useful for validation, too. Finally, validation opportunities are dependent on the location and size of cloud-free regions, since clouds with optical thickness > 1 hinder MERLIN observations. Therefore, existing space lidar measurements from the NASA CALIPSO mission with similar field of view were analysed and show that the northern and southern hemisphere’s subtropics are most favourable validation regions.",

            "abstract": "To evaluate the improvement of city-scale emission inventory, a high-resolution emission inventory of air pollutants for Nanjing is first developed combining detailed source information, and then justified through quantitative analysis with observations. The best available domestic emission factors and unit-/facility-based activity level data were compiled based on a thorough field survey on major emission sources. Totally 1089 individual emission sources were identified as point sources and all the emission-related parameters including burner type, combustion technology, fuel quality, and removal efficiency of pollution control devices, are carefully investigated and analyzed. Some new data such as detailed information of city fueling-gas stations, construction sites, monthly activity level, data from continuous emission monitoring systems and traffic flow information were combined to improve spatiotemporal distribution of this inventory. For SO2, NOX and CO, good spatial correlations were found between ground observation (9 state controlling air sampling sites in Nanjing) and city-scale emission inventory (R2=0.34, 0.38 and 0.74, respectively). For TSP, PM10 and PM2.5, however, poorer correlation was found due to relatively weaker accuracy in emission estimation and spatial distribution of road dust. The mixing ratios between specific pollutants including OC/EC, BC/CO and CO2/CO, are well correlated between those from ground observation and emission. Compared to MEIC (Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China), there is a better spatial consistence between this city-scale emission inventory and NO2 measured by OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument). In particular, the city-scale emission inventory still correlated well with satellite observations (R2=0.28) while the regional emission inventory showed little correlation with satellite observations (R2=0.09) when grids containing power plants are excluded. It thus confirms the improvement of city-scale emission inventory on industrial and transportation sources other than big power plants. Through the inventory evaluation, the necessity to develop high-resolution emission inventory with comprehensive emission source information is revealed for atmospheric science studies and air quality improvement at local scale.",

            "abstract": "What flow or range of flows is most responsible for transporting sediment and maintaining continuity in a river? This question has inspired scores of magnitude and frequency of sediment transport analysis (MFA) studies and has been a focus of the ongoing debate regarding process vs. form-based approaches to stable channel design. We consider this question across the spectrum of stream types from flashy sand bed streams dominated by suspended load to snow-melt gravel and cobble streams dominated by bed load. First we consider the relationship between flow variability, bed material size (entrainment threshold), and the range of the most effective discharges using an updated theoretical approach to MFA. We find a physical mechanism that explains the diverging relationship between the most effective discharge and flow variability in fine vs. coarse bed channels.\nWe also conduct MFA on 192 streams with existing bed material load data collected near a stream gage and characterize relationships between various metrics (e.g., the effective discharge, the percent of sediment transported by discharges less than the effective discharge, and the half yield discharge: the discharge below which a cumulative 50% of bed material yield occurs) versus channel form, flow variability, and bed material properties. We find that suspended load dominated streams are more sensitive to metrics describing flow variability, whereas bed load dominated streams are more sensitive to physical aspects of the channel and bed sediment. We also find that the half yield discharge predicts bankfull discharge very well across stream types and that the bankfull discharge is consistently bounded by the discharges associated with the 25th and 75th percentile of cumulative sediment transport.\nThis work expands on previous MFA studies by applying a uniform method of bed material yield analysis across a wide range —and large number—of river types to characterize the relationships between hydrogeomorphic properties and the range, magnitude, and frequency of the most effective flows.",

The NEXRAD Enhanced Echo Tops (EET) and Vertical Integrated Liquid Density (VILD) are traditional proxies to storm height and severity. To retrieve the storm characteristics we construct probability histograms of respective EET and VILD values around each TGF.Here we show that although high-topped storms are consistently present in the vicinity of TGFs, the VILD values indicate storms of disparate convective strengths. In particular, the majority of our TGF sample is encompassed by storms of high EET (>10-11 km) values and in their majority overall VILD < ~2.0 gr m-3.These EET and VILD values are common in summertime oceanic/coastal low-latitude thunderstorms where the main convective core is limited in the first few kilometres and the updrafts are weak and narrow. Qualitative observations from the temporal evolution of the volumetric radar reflectivity shows that in a few cases the TGF emission signals the dissipation stage of the main convective core, although this suggestion is tentative and requires more sophisticated and currently ongoing storm tracking techniques. The atmospheric soundings (where available in spatial and temporal proximity with the respective TGF) indicate that TGF producing storms can exhibit a significant variation in their respective thermodynamic environment and type (e.g. regular to high CAPE, pulse vs. high shear etc).

            "abstract": "Porous carbonates form important reservoirs for water and hydrocarbons. The fluid flow properties of carbonate reservoirs may be affected by post-depositional processes (e.g., mechanical and chemical), which need to be quantified. Field-based studies described bed-parallel compaction bands (CBs) within carbonates with a wide range of porosities. These burial-related structures accommodate volumetric strain by grain rotation, translation, pore collapse and pressure solution. Recently, the same structures have been reproduced for the first time in the laboratory by performing triaxial compaction experiments on porous grainstones. These laboratory studies characterized and compared the microstructures of natural and laboratory CBs, but no analysis of pore connectivity has been performed.\nIn this paper, we use an innovative approach to characterize the pore networks (e.g. porosity, connectivity) of natural and laboratory CBs and compare them with the host rock one.\nWe collected the data using the synchrotron X-ray computed microtomography technique at the SYRMEP beamline of the Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste Laboratory (Italy). Quantitative analyses of the samples were performed with the Pore3D software library. The porosity was calculated from segmented 3D images of pristine and deformed carbonates. A process of skeletonization was then applied to quantify the number of connected pores within the rock volume. The analysis of the skeleton allowed us to highlight the differences between natural and laboratory CBs, and to investigate how pore connectivity evolves as a function of different deformation pathways.\nBoth pore volume and connectivity are reduced within the CBs respect to the pristine rock and the natural CB has a lower porosity with respect to the laboratory one. The grain contacts in the natural CB are welded, whereas in the laboratory one they have more irregular shapes and grain crushing is the predominant process.",

Overlying the pre-impact lithologies and rim breccias is a thin apron of fine-grained sediments, the Grasberg fm, forming annuli on the lower slopes of rim segments. Hesperian Burns fm sandstones overly the Grasberg fm. Grasberg rocks have major element compositions that are distinct from Burns fm sandstones, especially when comparing interior compositions exposed by the Rock Abrasion Tool. Grasberg rocks are also different from Endeavour rim breccias, but have general compositional similarities to them. Grasberg sediments are plausibly fine-grained materials derived from the impact breccias. Veins of CaSO4 transect Grasberg fm rocks demonstrating post-formation aqueous alteration. Minor/trace elements show variations consistent with mobilization by aqueous fluids. Grasberg fm rocks have low Mn and high Fe/Mn ratios compared to the other lithologies. Manganese likely was mobilized and removed from the Grasberg host rock by redox reactions. We posit that Fe2+ from acidic solutions associated with formation of the Burns sulfate-rich sandstones acted as an electron donor to reduce more oxidized Mn to Mn2+. The Fe contents of Grasberg rocks are slightly higher than in other rocks suggesting precipitation of Fe phases in Grasberg materials. Pancam spectra show that Grasberg rocks have a higher fraction of ferric oxide minerals than other Endeavour rim rocks. Solutions transported Mn2+ into the Endeavour rim materials and oxidized and/or precipitated it in them. Grasberg has higher contents of the mobile elements K, Zn, Cl, and Br compared to the rim materials. Similar enrichments of mobile elements were measured by the Spirit APXS on West Spur and around Home Plate in Gusev crater. Enhancements in these elements are attributed to interactions of hydrothermal acidic fluids with the host rocks. Interactions of fluids with the Grasberg fm postdate the genesis of the Endeavour rim phyllosilicates. The aqueous alteration history of Endeavour rim rocks is complicated by different styles of alteration that have spanned the Noachian and Hesperian. Late stage acidic aqueous alteration of Grasberg fm materials is likely penecontemporaneous with the diagenesis of the sulfate-rich sediments of Meridiani Planum.",

It is anticipated that the vulnerability of coastal cities will increase due to the effects of climate change, and in particular sea level rise (SLR). We have developed a novel framework to construct a physics-based storm surge model that includes projections of coastal floodplain dynamics under climate change scenarios. Numerous experiments were conducted and it was concluded that a number of influencing factors, other than SLR, should be included in future assessments of coastal flooding under climate change; e.g., shoreline changes, barrier island morphology, salt marsh migration, and population dynamics. These factors can significantly affect the path, pattern, and magnitude of flooding depths and inundation along the coastline (Bilskie et al., 2014; Passeri et al., 2014).\nUsing these factors, a storm surge model of the northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOM) representing present day conditions is modified to characterize the future outlook of the landscape. This adapted model is then used to assess flood risk in terms of the 100-year floodplain surface under SLR scenarios. A suite of hundreds of synthetic storms, derived by JPM-OS (Joint Probability Method – Optimum Sampling), are filtered to obtain the storms necessary to represent the statistically determined 100-year floodplain. The NGOM storm surge model is applied to simulate the synthetic storms and determine, for each storm, the flooding surface and depth, for four SLR scenarios for the year 2100 as prescribed by Parris et al. (2012). The collection of results facilitate the estimation of water surface elevation vs. frequency curves across the floodplain and the statistically defined 100-year floodplain is extracted. This novel method to assess coastal flooding under climate change can be performed across any coastal region worldwide, and results provide awareness of regions vulnerable to extreme flooding in the future.",

            "abstract": "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Special Applications Science Center is monitoring temporal changes at the Colonia Glacier and Lago Cachet Dos, Northern Patagonia Icefield of southern Chile. This location is one of the newest international sites in the USGS Global Fiducial Program (GFP)—a program which provides systematic monitoring of dynamic and environmentally critical areas with high-resolution imagery (http://gfp.usgs.gov/). In 2008, Lago Cachet Dos began experiencing glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) during which the entire pool of water (about 200 million m3) rapidly drains from the lake and flows south-southeast through the Colonia Glacier. These catastrophic events cause massive erosion of lake-bed and valley-fill deposits, and consequent upstream expansion of Lago Cachet Dos towards Lago Cachet Uno. Panchromatic and multispectral images for 1979, 2007, and 2014 highlight the dramatic changes that have occurred at this site over a 35-year period. The lake was smallest in 1979, when the Colonia Glacier was at its maximum thickness and extent during the study period. Between 1979 and 2007, the glacier shrank causing an increase in the surface area of the lake. The size of the lake increased substantially, from 2.98 km2 in 1979 to 4.41 km2 in 2014, primarily due to erosion of valley-fill deposits at its northern edge by the 15 GLOFs that occurred between April 2008 and February 2014. Ongoing studies of the Colonia Glacier and Lago Cachet Dos are focused on providing real-time monitoring of Lago Cachet Dos lake levels, understanding the history of advances and retreats of the Colonia Glacier, and determining the physical mechanisms and hazards associated with the GLOFs that come from Lago Cachet Dos.",

            "abstract": "The current Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) do not treat soils as a dynamical system and lack the capability to account for soil erosion processes (detachment, deposition and sediment transport), which limits their usage for investigating soil carbon dynamics and the global carbon cycle. We address this problem by developing a soil erosion module for application in the Max Planck Earth System Model (MPI-ESM), which could represent the different soil erosion processes at a global scale. This module computes soil detachment first, which is then integrated in a simple sediment mass-balance equation to estimate sediment deposition and transport. Soil detachment is modelled by implementing the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation model, RUSLE. For this, we use scaled global datasets of topography, precipitation, soil and land-use as input data. We also perform a sensitivity study on the topography and precipitation factors in the RUSLE model, and show that there is a large uncertainty involved when applying these RUSLE factors at a global scale. The sediment mass-balance equation is imbedded in a cascade grid structure that represents sediment flow and considers soil detachment from the RUSLE model and a deposition term to model alluvial and colluvial sediment storages and fluxes. As a first step towards a large scale implementation, the complete soil erosion module is applied on a 10km spatial resolution on the Rhine river catchment and is validated with existing sediment data. We find that the soil erosion module operates well at this spatial scale for the Rhine catchment and is thus promising for the application in MPI-ESM. However, the challenge remains to make the model applicable on a global scale. Hence, we present the different challenges of applying the module for other catchments that are physically different from the Rhine catchment, and show the perspectives of using the module as a basis for a global carbon mass balance model.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic conductivity is the property to describe how water is moving through porous medium. It is related to the intrinsic permeability of the geological materials in two general groups: consolidated and unconsolidated materials. In general, groundwater is prone to flow through the porosity and fractures. In consolidated rocks, the flow channel is mostly defined by the fractures, such as fault zones, joints and etc. By contrast, the flow channel is defined by fractures as well as sediment porosity in the unconsolidated materials. In this study, we tested the hydraulic conductivity and its variations in the unconsolidated alluviums, which are cut through by thrusting of the Chihshang fault with a creeping rate of 2 cm/yr in eastern Taiwan.\nWe conducted injection tests with an array of six tiltmeters to measure the surface tilt during the experiments. The results of the hydraulic experiments exhibited a high heterogeneity of the aquifer hydro-mechanical responses and are in agreement with the existence of a lower permeable hanging wall and a higher permeable footwall. The surface tilt signals displayed a hydraulic gradient increasing toward the injection well particularly in the hanging wall. On other hand, no significant signal in the footwall, which means that the water flow slowly parallel through the fault zone and infiltrated quickly in the relative higher permeable footwall. We conclude that the fault plane, which dips at 40-50 degrees toward the hanging-wall side, plays a critical role as a barrier of water conduits.",

            "abstract": "Whole rock powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments from eight samples collected across a retrograde ductile shear zone in the Devonian Littleton Formation near Claremont, NH, exhibit broad and asymmetric to bimodal muscovite 00l reflections. These composite 00l reflections exhibit a systematic change in shape with increasing retrograde strain. Microtextural relationships, electron microprobe quantitative analyses, and element mapping indicate that the change in peak shape reflects progressive dissolution of metastable Na-rich muscovite and the precipitation of stable Na-poor muscovite.\n40Ar/39Ar step heating experiments on muscovite concentrates from these samples show a decrease in total gas age from 274 to 258 Ma as the highest strain zone is approached, and steps within individual spectra range in age by ~20 m.y. The correlation between age and 00l peak shape suggests that the argon isotopic system also tracks the dissolution-precipitation process. Furthermore, the variation in age during step heating indicates that these populations exhibit different in-vacuo degassing behavior.\nComparison of whole rock and muscovite concentrate XRD patterns from the same samples shows that the mineral separation process can fractionate these muscovite populations. With this knowledge, four muscovite concentrates were prepared from a single hand sample, analyzed by XRD, and dated. Combining modal estimates from XRD experiments with total gas ages, the four splits narrowly define a mixing line that resolves end-member ages of 250 and 300 Ma for the neocrystallized and earlier high grade populations of muscovite, respectively. These ages are consistent with age data from all other samples.\nThe results show that, in some settings, powder XRD provides a powerful and time effective method to both identify the existence of and establish the proportions of multiple compositional populations of muscovite prior to 40Ar/39Ar analysis. This approach will be especially useful in settings where fine grain-size, intragrain zoning, and micron-scale intergrowth complicate in-situ analysis, and where impure mineral concentrates, low Cl concentrations and/or low variance in muscovite Cl/K ratios preclude chemical discrimination using isotopic compositions obtained during 40Ar/39Ar step heating experiments.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies of modern terrestrial plants growing at a single location reveal that 2H/1H fractionation between source water and leaf wax n-alkyl lipids can vary by up to 100‰. This provides a challenge for interpreting sedimentary n-alkyl δ2H records, because the contribution of isotopically different plants can shift through time. Palaeohydrological studies often either ignore this factor or try accounting for it by identifying the presence/absence of vegetation change using n-alkane molecular distributions or δ13C values.\nTo evaluate potential problems associated with those approaches, we applied two different methods for reconstructing palaeoprecipitation δ2H from n-alkanes extracted from 1 m core from Stiffkey saltmarsh, Norfolk, UK. We found that sediment n-alkane d2H values shifted by up to 70‰ since the 1500’s, with the main positive excursion between the 1720’s and 1820’s. Over the same period, however, δ13C values varied by only 1-3‰. We used the IsoConc mixing model to predict down-core vegetation change. We identified three time intervals where plant contributions shifted. We then calculated palaeoprecipitation δ2H using: (a) previously published εwax/water, and (b) εwax/water calculated for the Stiffkey plants. The palaeoprecipitation δ2H determined using the first approach showed 30-45‰ shifts from the 1620’s to 1870’s. In contrast, calculations using εwax/water derived specifically for the Stiffkey plants showed only small fluctuations of <14‰.\nThis study demonstrates that the assumption of a minimal role of shifts in isotopically different palaeovegetation may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding δ2H values of paleoprecipitation. In addition, selection of appropriate εwax/water values is critical for accurate reconstruction of this parameter. New methods are required to identify, quantify, and correct for vegetation shifts in sedimentary sequences to ensure the influence of plant community change can be evaluated when interpreting biomarker δ2H records.",

In this work we present an experimental study on the effects of surface gravity waves of different wavelengths on the wave phase averaged performance characteristics of a marine current turbine model. Measurements are performed with a 1/25 scale (diameter D=0.8m) two bladed horizontal axis turbine towed in the large (116m long) towing tank at the U.S. Naval Academy equipped with a dual-flap, servo-controlled wave maker. Three regular waves with wavelengths of 15.8, 8.8 and 3.9m with wave heights adjusted such that all waveforms have the same energy input per unit width are produced by the wave maker and model turbine is towed into the waves at constant carriage speed of 1.68 m/s. This representing the case of waves travelling in the same direction as the mean current. Thrust and torque developed by the model turbine are measured using a dynamometer mounted in line with the turbine shaft. Shaft rotation speed and blade position are measured using in in-house designed shaft position indexing system. The tip speed ratio (TSR) is adjusted using a hysteresis brake which is attached to the output shaft. Free surface elevation and wave parameters are measured with two optical wave height sensors, one located in the turbine rotor plane and other one diameter upstream of the rotor. All instruments are synchronized in time and data is sampled at a rate of 700 Hz.\nAll measured quantities are conditionally sampled as a function of the measured surface elevation and transformed to wave phase space using the Hilbert Transform. Phenomena observed in earlier experiments with the same turbine such as phase lag in the torque signal and an increase in thrust due to Stokes drift are examined and presented with the present data as well as spectral analysis of the torque and thrust data.",

Hence, small changes in soil respiration rates could have large effects on atmospheric CO2. In order to assess CO2 emissions from diverse European soils under different land-use and climate (soil moisture and temperature) we conducted a laboratory incubation experiment.\nTherefore, we incubated soil cores (Ø 7 cm; height 7 cm) from nine European sites which are spread all over Europe; from the United Kingdom (west) to the Ukraine (east) and Italy (south) to Finland (north). In addition these sites can be clearly distinguished between their land use into forests, arable lands, grasslands and one peat land. Soil cores were incubated in a two-factorial experimental design at 5 different temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20, and 25°C) and 6 different moisture contents (5, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 % water filled pore space (WFPS)). An automated laboratory incubation measurement system was used to measure CO2 emissions.\nResults show that highest CO2 emissions occurred with intermediate moisture content (40% to 70%) over all sites. We found that the relationship between CO2 emissions and temperature could be well described by a Gaussian model (R² ranges from 0.87 to 1) over all sites. In general CO2 emissions were strongly related with both variables temperature and moisture. Temperature sensitivity (Q10) was negatively correlated with temperature for all land-uses investigated. Moisture sensitivity was calculated as the slope of a quadratic function and showed highest values at very low and high moisture content for all land-uses investigated. Moisture sensitivity was increasing with temperature for all arable lands investigated. All coniferous forest sites investigated showed a strong increase of the temperature sensitivity at lower temperatures at a moisture range of 20 – 40 % WFPS.\nIn summary our results showed not only the relationship between temperature sensitivity of CO2 emissions and moisture content for a broad range of land-uses within Europe but also investigated the relationship between moisture sensitivity of CO2 emissions and temperature for said land-uses for the first time.",

The GCPO LCC covers part or all of 12 states and 5 sub-geographies, totaling approximately 726,000 km2, and is centered on the lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley.

Initially, the physically-based models are calibrated to measured streamflow data to provide a baseline for comparison. An enhanced calibration procedure then is used to calibrate the physically-based models in the gaged and ungaged areas of the GCPO LCC using statistically-based estimates of streamflow. For this application, the calibration procedure is adjusted to address the limitations of the statistically generated time series to reproduce measured streamflow in gaged basins, primarily by incorporating error and bias estimates.

This is of crucial importance for the establishment of highly accurate and consistent geodetic reference frames, as the basis for a reliable monitoring of the time-varying shape, rotation and gravity field of the Earth.\nA major focus was on the compilation of an inventory based on the evaluation of the standards and conventions currently in use by the IAG Services and their contributing analysis centres and for the generation of geometric and gravimetric products, such as geodetic reference frames, Earth orientation parameters, gravity field models and satellite orbits. This product-based inventory presents the current status concerning standards and conventions, indicating that there are several inconsistencies.

Total water storage (TWS) trends from the GRACE satellite observations were also used to assist the assessment. The objectives are to quantify the magnitudes and spatial patterns of the water budget imbalance (e) and its sources of errors over Canada. Results show that the water budget was closed within 10% of the P on average for all the basins. The e showed a general pattern of positive values in the south and negative values in the north and mountainous regions. The positive and negative values of e among the 19 basins were largely offset and the all-basin average e was close to zero. Uncertainties in the water budget variables, particularly P, were found to play a major role in the e. There are 11 basins showing significant trends in TWS over 2003-2008, which accounted for 31% of their e on average. Improvements in the observation network, data quality assurance, and spatial models for P are critical for further improving the water budget closure.",

Rayleigh-wave dispersion curves are measured by the two-station technique for a total of 531 inter-station paths using vertical-component broad-band waveforms at 32 seismic stations from the China National Seismic Network (CNSN) from 467 global earthquakes.\nThese interstation dispersion curves are then inverted for the high-resolution isotropic and azimuthally anisotropic phase-velocity maps at various periods between 20 and 100 s.\nIn the period range of 20-40 s, sampling the middle and lower crust, the isotropic structure exhibits a clear contrast between the strong fast anomaly below the Yangtze and Sino-Korean Cratons in the east and the very slow anomaly beneath eastern Tibet.\n At periods sampling the crust (20-60 s), the anisotropy we observe suggests that the Tibetan crust flows eastwards up to longitude around 100°E, and then bends southwards.\nAt longer periods, the anisotropic structures are in agreement with absolute plate motion and the overall upper-mantle flow. The anisotropic patterns we observe support a mechanical decoupling between the lower crust and lithospheric upper mantle.",

            "abstract": "Boron isotopes (δ11B) and boron/calcium ratios (B/Ca) in tests of planktic foraminifera are controlled by equilibrium reactions between boron and carbon species in seawater, and thus represent important proxies of past marine carbonate chemistry. Indeed, the recent application of these boron-based proxies to fossil shells of planktic foraminifera from cores spanning the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; 56Ma, an abrupt global warming and ocean acidification event) reveal a decline of ~0.3 in the pH of the mixed-layer [1], an anomaly that is well within the range of estimates based on the observed shoaling of the carbonate compensation depth (CCD) [2, and references therein]. The PETM occurred superimposed on a long-term warming trend that initiated in the Late Paleocene and continued into the Early Eocene (LPEE; 53-59Ma). The magnitude of warming [3] and deepening of the CCD [4] indicate that the LPEE was driven by a rise in pCO2 nearly equivalent to that of the PETM [5].\nHere we extend the PETM record of boron-based proxies at IODP Site 1209 across the LPEE, in conjunction with stable carbon and oxygen isotopes in planktic foraminifera, in order to better constrain the long-term changes in pH and carbonate chemistry that accompanied the suggested rise in atmospheric CO2. The 20kyr resolution B/Ca record shows a long-term decline of ~25% during the LPEE, as well as subtle 400kyr cycles associated with eccentricity that mirror those observed in δ13C, and thus might reflect on changes in pH. The lower resolution δ11B record exhibits little change during the Late Paleocene before decreasing step-wise to lower values following the PETM, indicating that either pH in the upper ocean did not change significantly prior to the PETM, despite warming and inferred pCO2 increase, or changes in δ11Bseawater compensated for pH driven changes. As verification of these observations at Site 1209, complementary B/Ca and δ11B records are being generated for Atlantic IODP Sites 1262 and 1263.\n[1] Penman et al. 2014.

            "abstract": "Over 2/3 of the global hydrothermal heat flux occurs at low temperatures (< 150°) on the ridge flanks carried by fluid volumes comparable to riverine discharge. Understanding ridge flank hydrothermal exchange is important to quantify global geochemical cycles. Hydrothermal chemical pathways are complex and the effects of water-rock reactions remain poorly constrained. Factors controlling fluid flow include volcanic structure, sediment thickness, and basement topography. This study compares the effects of low temperature alteration in two locations with contrasting hydrogeological regimes.\nThe intermediate spreading Juan de Fuca ridge flank (JdF) in the northeast Pacific sports a thick sediment blanket. Rare basement outcrops are sites of fluid recharge and discharge. The average alteration extent (~10% secondary minerals), oxidation ratio (Fe3+/FeTOT=34%), and alteration character (orange, green, grey halos) of basement is constant with crustal age and depth along a 0.97–3.6 m.yr transect of ODP basement holes. However, vesicle fills record an increasingly complex history of successive alteration with age.\nIn contrast, North Pond, a ~8 m.yr-old sediment-filled basin at 22N on the slow spreading Mid Atlantic Ridge, hosts rapid, relatively cool SE to NW basinal fluid flow. Average alteration extent (~10%) and oxidation ratio (33%) of Hole 395A basalts are similar to JdF. However, 395A cores are dominated by orange alteration halos, lack celadonite, but have abundant zeolite. Vesicle fill combinations are highly variable, but the most common fill progression is from oxidising to less oxidising secondary assemblages.\nThe comparable extent of alteration between these two sites and the absence of an age relationship on the JdF suggests that the alteration extent of the upper crust is uniform and mostly established by 1 Myr. However, the variable alteration character reflects the influence of regional hydrology on hydrothermal alteration.",

            "abstract": "Extension across the mid-Atlantic plate boundary in south Iceland is taken up by two parallel zones, the Western and the Eastern Volcanic Zones. Spreading across the western zone is of the order of 1-7 mm/year, qualifying it as an ultra-slow rift. The Prestahnúkur fissure swarm in the Western Volcanic Zone offers an opportunity to study magma-tectonic interaction in an ultra-slow spreading setting. In this study, fractures and faults were mapped in detail from aerial photographs to determine the extent of the fissure swarm. The fissure swarm is about 60 km long and 10 km wide, although its extent to the south is uncertain due to its linkage with the adjacent Hengill fissure swarm. The fissure swarm has both open fractures, indicating postglacial activation, and normal faults with up to 45 m vertical offset. Hyaloclastite ridges („tindars“), produced by subglacial fissure eruptions during the Pleistocene, are found within the fissure swarm, as well as postglacial lava flows. Intermittent seismicity occurs in the area. Earthquakes during the last ~24 years were relocated to study their relation with the surface fractures. Relocation of these events indicate that some of the fractures seen on surface have been activated during these years. The small cumulative seismic moment and slow spreading measured by geodetic methods nevertheless show that no dike intrusions have occurred during this period. Pleistocene tindars and Holocene lavas are clear indications of magmatism, however. We therefore suggest that the Prestahnúkur fissure swarm is mainly formed by diking and rifting during rifting episodes, whereas small scale fracture movements can occur during inter-rifting periods. The present small-scale fracture movements may indicate lack of magma to drive dike intrusions.",

            "abstract": "In snowmelt-driven river systems, it is critical to enable reliable predictions of the spatiotemporal variability in the seasonal snowpack in order to support local and regional water management. Previous studies have shown that improved snow predictions can be achieved by assimilating bias corrected snow depth retrievals from satellite-based passive microwave (PMW) sensors. However, improved snow predictions do not necessarily always translate into improved predictions of streamflow on which water management heavily relies. In this presentation, we explore how the existing bias correction strategy based on the optimal interpolation algorithm can be enhanced to produce an improved satellite-gauge blended snow depth product, which, when assimilated into a distributed snowmelt-runoff model, can lead to consistently improved streamflow predictions. The methodology is applied to the bias reduction of the snow depth estimates from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), which is then assimilated into the Noah land surface model via an ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) for streamflow prediction in the Upper Colorado River Basin. Our results indicate that using observations from high-elevation stations (e.g., the Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations) and terrain aspect information in the bias correction process is critically important in achieving desirable streamflow predictions. Incorporating snow cover information (e.g., from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)) into bias correction can further improve the streamflow results. However, increasing the spatial resolution of bias correction tends to have mixed results on streamflow prediction.",

In addition, measuring englacial and subglacial propserties is critical for oceanographic studies (circulation beneath ice shelvs), paleoclimate studies (mapping internal reflecting horizons; measuring the thickness and properties of subglacial sediments), biological studies (estimating the potential for conditions conducive to harboring lifeforms), and many other applications. Some of these properties are relatively stable over time and space, and some can change rapidly. For example, ice shelf basal melt is on the order of meters per year; sediment erosion and deposition varies from nil to meters per year.\nTechniques for measuring these properties are many and varied. Here we focus on radar and seismic methods, with emphasis on high-resolution measurements of the bed. We made radar measurements over multiple sites on Whilllans Ice Stream, Kamb Ice Strea, and the Ross Ice Shelf to compare and contrast bed conditions. These measurements were repeated after a two- and four-week interval to monitor change. The radar system used was a broad band multichannel array system optimized for high spatial resolution. Bed reflection phase is compared to internal-horizon phase to estimate change in bed properties. Work was conducted (and repeated) along long traverse lines allowing for measuring spatial and temporal variations in changes in bed conditions.",

Their dynamic spectral feature can be potentially used to diagnose important parameters of the reconnection site such as plasma density and spatial size of the fragmentation. Yet direct observational evidence supporting this scenario has been elusive mainly due to the lack of imaging observations. The upgraded Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) provides the first opportunity of performing simultaneous radio imaging and dynamic spectroscopy, which allows radio sources to be imaged at every spatio-temporal pixel in the dynamic spectrum. Here we report Jansky VLA observations of decimetric spike bursts recorded during an eruptive solar limb flare. Combined with EUV and X-ray data from SDO and RHESSI, we show that the spike bursts coincide spatially with a loop-top hard X-ray source, which are located in a region where supra-arcade downflows meet the underlying hot, EUV/X-ray loops. We interpret the observed spike bursts as a direct signature of non-thermal electrons accelerated by turbulences and/or shocks in the reconnection outflow region.",

(Nature, 2010) among others, demonstrates the potential for using soil moisture as an indicator and parameter for identifying long-term changes in climate trends. The study mentioned links the reduction in global evapotranspiration observed after the 1998 El Nino to decline in moisture supplies in the soil profile. Due to its crucial role in the terrestrial cycles and the demonstrated strong feedback with other climate variables, soil moisture has been recognized by the Global Climate Observing System as one of the 50 Essential Climate Variables (ECVs). The most cost and time effective way of monitoring soil moisture at global scale on routine basis, which is one of the requirements for ECVs, is using satellite technologies. AMSR-E was the first satellite mission to include soil moisture as an operational product. AMSR-E provided us with almost a decade of soil moisture data that are now extended by AMSR2, allowing the generation of a consistent and continuous global soil moisture data record. AMSR-E and AMSR2 are technically alike, thus, they are expected to have similar performance and accuracy, which needs to be confirmed and this the main focus of our research. AMSR-E stopped operating at its optimal rotational speed about 6 months before the launch of AMSR2, which complicates the direct inter-comparison and assessment of AMSR2 performance relative to AMSR-E. The AMSR-E and AMSR2 brightness temperature data and the corresponding soil moisture retrievals derived using the Single Channel Approach were evaluated separately at several ground validation sides located in the US. Brightness temperature inter-comparisons were done using monthly climatology and the low spin AMSR-E data acquired at 2 rpm. Both analyses showed very high agreement between the two instruments and revealed a constant positive bias at all locations in the AMSR2 observations relative to AMSR-E. Removal of this bias is essential in order to ensure consistency between both instruments. The corresponding soil moisture retrievals from AMSR-E and AMSR2 demonstrated reasonable agreement relative to in situ data. A detailed discussion that focuses on this analysis as well as possible approaches for removing the observed bias in the brightness temperature observations will be presented.",

            "abstract": "In ungaged basins, predictions of daily streamflow are essential to responsible and effective management and design of water resources systems. Transfer-based methods are widely used for prediction in ungaged basins (PUB) within a gaged network. Such methods rely on the transfer of information from an index gage to an ungaged site. In what is known as the nearest-neighbor algorithm, the index gage is selected based on geospatial proximity. The predictions offered by any PUB method can be highly uncertain, and it is often difficult to characterize this uncertainty. In the development of predicted streamflow records, understanding the uncertainty of estimates would greatly improve water resources management in ungaged basins. It is proposed that by resampling the sites of the gaged network, with replacement, a set of equally-probable streamflow predictions can be produced for any ungaged site. For a particular day in the record, the percentiles of the distribution of the resampled, predicted streamflows can be used to estimate confidence intervals of the original daily streamflow predictions. This approach is explored in the Southeast United States with a nearest-neighbor application of non-linear spatial interpolation using flow duration curves (QPPQ), a common PUB method. Though some interval re-centering is required to ensure that the best-case prediction falls within the confidence intervals, it is shown that this technique provides a reasonable first-order approximation of prediction uncertainty. Still, the best estimated confidence intervals are shown to consistently under-estimate the nominal confidence. It is hypothesized that this interval contraction is a result of temporal and spatial correlation within the gaged network. Additionally, implications of prediction uncertainty are explored and alternative estimators are considered.",

However, very few studies have paid attention to crustal velocity discontinuities due to the limitation of spatial resolution. In this study, we show the major crustal and Moho discontinuities in the Japanese Islands estimated from receiver function analyses. To identify the spatial changes of velocity discontinuities, we construct many vertical cross-sections of receiver function images transferred lapse-time from P onset to depth using one-dimensional velocity structure models estimated at each station. The velocity structures are estimated from a grid search method of receiver functions in this study. They are also used to interpret the depths of Moho discontinuity. As a result, we identified many seismic discontinuities in the crust and the uppermost mantle. There are distinct positive gradient just beneath the seismogenic zone of shallow in-land earthquakes, which corresponding a velocity boundary between the upper crust and the middle or lower crust. The intra-crust discontinuities in the northeastern Japan region imply heterogeneous structures horizontally. The depths of Moho discontinuity tend to increase in mountain regions with some undulations. However, the discontinuities where volcanic deep low frequency earthquakes occur are not clear and characterized by a low-velocity or negative velocity gradient area sandwiched between the positive velocity contrasts. The depths of Moho discontinuity interpreted from receiver functions are deeper than the estimation from tomographic imaging and travel time of the refracted seismic waves in several areas. This may suggest the existence of low-Vs and/or high-Vp/Vs materials in the crust-mantle boundary.",

            "abstract": "Accurate analysis of trace H in NAMs has become important with recognition that even small amounts of H influence geochemical and geophysical processes. FTIR and SIMS can measure concentrations down to ~1 ppmw H2O. However, a major limitation is that they rely on standards calibrated with other methods. SIMS matrix effects for H in NAMs are poorly constrained, but are likely dominated by differences in mean atomic mass. Here we use volatile-free molar weight (VFMW) normalized to one O/mol as a proxy for this parameter [cf. 1].\nOur goal is to constrain SIMS matrix effects by combining our work on olivine [2], pyroxene [3], and feldspar [4] with new data on kyanite, zircon, and 37 garnets (pyropes, grossulars, spessartines, and andradites), while critically evaluating absolute calibrations of IR absorption coefficients (εi) for H in NAMs. All of these NAMs taken together span a wider range in VFMW (~32-45) than in previous comparisons [5, 6] concentrating only on olivine, pyroxene, and pyrope-rich garnet (VFMW ~ 34-37).\nOur results and conclusions include the following:\n1) SIMS-FTIR comparisons demonstrate that εi is wavenumber dependent for feldspar, zircon, grossular, and clinopyroxene, in accord with theory and empirical calibrations on hydrous materials. On the other hand, a factor of 3 difference in εi for H defects in olivine [7] is unsupported by our data [2].\n2) Calibration slopes (for plots of ppmw H2O vs. 16OH/30Si × SiO2) correlate positively with VFMW, an effect not discerned in previous work [6]. This result is also opposite to a study demonstrating a negative correlation for hydrous phases and glasses [1]. This discrepancy may be related to differences in analytical methods (e.g., Cs+ vs. O- primary beam, collection of OH- versus H+).\n3) Scatter in the trend of calibration slopes vs. VFMW is likely due to uncertainties in εi. Another possible factor is the structure of the matrix, which can affect the kinetic energy of cascade collisions leading to secondary ion sputtering.\n[1] King et al (2002) Am Min 87, 1077-1089 [2] Mosenfelder et al (2011), Am Min 96, 1725-1741 [3] Mosenfelder and Rossman (2013a, 2013b), Am Min 98, 1026-1041; 1042-1054 [4] Mosenfelder et al (submitted) Am Min [5] Koga et al.

Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) techniques offer the flexibility to permit sufficiently high-resolution grid patches over features of interests without compromising accuracy or being computationally prohibitive. One such approach, being developed by the Applied Numerical Algorithms Group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and collaborators, is a non-hydrostatic finite-volume General Circulation Model (GCM) on a cubed-sphere grid with dynamic adaptive mesh refinement capabilities called Chombo-AMR. The 2D shallow-water equations exhibit many of the complexities of 3D GCM dynamical cores. Thus they serve as an effective method for testing the dynamical core and the refinement strategies of adaptive atmospheric models. We investigate the accuracy and efficiency of refinement strategies with the Chombo-AMR dynamical core in shallow-water mode. In particular, we use a suite of test cases consisting of both simple and complex dynamical flows, including a test case designed to simulate tropical cyclone-like vortices. We use the suite to test the effectiveness of the refinement criteria for both static and dynamic grid configurations as well as the sensitivity of the model results to the criteria.",

            "abstract": "Croplands occupy more than one third of Earth’s terrestrial surface contributing to climate change and also being impacted by those changes, since their production is conditioned by climatic conditions and water resources. It is thus essential to quantify and analyze the production and the main components of the carbon and water cycles for crop ecosystems. We propose here a regional modeling approach that combines: high spatial and temporal resolutions (HSTR) optical remote sensing data, a simple crop model and an extensive set of in-situ measurements for model’s calibration and validation. The model, named SAFYE-CO2 (Simple Algorithm for Fluxes and Yield Estimates), is a daily time step model based on Monteith’s light-use efficiency theory and coupled with a water budget module (FAO-56 method). SAFYE-CO2 estimates components of the carbon budget (gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (Reco), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), …) and of the crop water cycle (evaporation, transpiration, evapotranspiration (ETR) and soil water content) and also time courses of dry aboveground biomass and yield by assimilating Green Area Index (GAI) data obtained from HSTR satellite observations. For this work, we used a unique set of Formosat-2 and SPOT images acquired from 2006 to 2011 in southwest France. Crop and soil model parameters were set using both in-situ measurements and values found in the literature. Phenological parameters were calibrated by the GAI assimilation. The results indicate that the model correctly reproduces winter wheat biomass and yield production (relative error about 25%) for years with contrasted climatic conditions. The estimated net carbon flux components were overall in agreement with the flux measurements, presenting good correlations (R² about 0.9 for GPP, 0.77 for Reco and 0.84 for NEE). Regarding the ETR, a good correlation (R2 about 0.73) and satisfactory errors (RMSE about 0.47 mm.d-1) were found. Carbon and water budgets as well as some water use efficiency (WUE) indices were computed, allowing to evaluate the crop ecosystems in terms of environmental and agronomical aspects. Still, the performances of this method could be improved by considering weeds or re-growths events after harvest. This approach could be extended to a global scale thanks to the future Sentinel-2 products.",

            "abstract": "The Paleogene operating mode of Meridional overturning circulation (MOC) consisted of a bipolar Pacific MOC that circulated independently from the Atlantic MOC. Reconstructions based on Nd isotopes and numerical modeling confirm a Paleogene MOC mode significantly different from the modern. But the outstanding questions of the timing and cause of the transition to the “modern” global mode of MOC remain. Furthermore, how did the strength of the MOC vary through the Paleogene and during the transition to the modern mode?\nIn order to address these questions, we need a way to estimate rates of deep-water advection. Here we explore the use of paired seawater Nd and Pb isotopes as a qualitative gauge of water mass advection rate. The premise is that as a water mass moves further from the region of convection, the initial dissolved Nd and Pb fingerprint will become increasingly decoupled due to increasing contributions of dissolved Pb from dust or ash dissolution in the water column.\nSouth Pacific DSDP Site 596 and North Pacific ODP Site 883 were well positioned to monitor the evolution of South Pacific Deep Water (SPDW) and North Pacific Deep Water (NPDW). At Site 596 the Nd and 206Pb/204Pb isotopes were relatively constant from ~60 to 38 Ma, but then varied significantly from ~38 Ma to 10 Ma. However, the corresponding 207,208Pb/204Pb values varied significantly until ~48 Ma, and them remained relatively constant to 10 Ma. At Site 883 the Nd values covaried with all three Pb isotope tracers from ~60 to 50 Ma - an increase in Nd coincided with a decrease in Pb values, followed by a decrease in Nd/increase in Pb. After 50Ma, Nd values remained constant (~-2 epsilon units) until ~35Ma, however during this interval all three Pb isotopes gradually increased. This decoupling of Pb and Nd either resulted from a change in the composition of Pb weathering into the NPDW source region, or the overprinting of Pb during water mass advection southward. The latter is consistent with a diminished flux of NPDW from ~50 to 35Ma, potentially enabling dust and ash dissolution to overprint the original NPDW Pb signature, while the Nd signature was preserved due to the longer residence time. As the flux of NPDW waned, the flux of SPDW remained nearly constant until ~38Ma.",

Many works have been done to analyze the retreating rate of glacier areas and volume against individual glaciers. However, it is challenging to obtain an accurate estimate of the entire glacier extent at the regional scale due to cloud issues and the similar spectral signature of snow and glacier. This study develops an object-oriented classification to map the glacier extent by using landsat images and analyzes the retreating rate of glacier area during the past half century. Our preliminary results show that our objected-oriented classification performs better than the regular classification methods, such as the supervised classification with maximum likelihood, band ratio method, snow index method, and so on. Summer snowfall events on the high elevations mountains lead to greatly over map the glacier extent. After carefully selecting the timing of the landsat images and adjusting the glacier extent overestimated due to snow cover, our mapped glacier extent is much smaller and illustrates more reasonable decadal variations than the world glacier inventory and other common land cover products. The glacier extent on the Central Tianshan Mountains illustrates a constant retreating trend, but its retreating rate is slowing down in the recent years.",

            "abstract": "High-depth-resolution sampling of stratified water bodies is often problematic, due to scale and/or accessibility (e.g. the Black Sea or remote lakes). In contrast, Fayetteville Green Lake (FGL), N.Y. is an easily accessible, 53 m deep meromictic system with an oxic upper mixolimnion (dissolved oxygen ~ 350 µM) and a euxinic lower monimolimnion (total sulfide ~1 mM). The accessibility and stability of FGL provides a unique opportunity for high-resolution sampling of a permanently stratified water column, allowing better characterization of the changes in concentration of biologically important trace elements within the framework of major element geochemistry.\nHigh-resolution (0.2 – 0.5m) sampling of FGL at various times of year reveals concentration shifts between the oxic and euxinic zone. For Mn, Fe, and Co, dissolved (< 0.2 µm) concentrations are lower in the oxic zone (~ 10 nM, 20 nM, and 1.5 nM, respectively), and higher in the euxinic zone (~ 6000 nM, 200 nM, and 8 nM). Ni and V exhibit little to no difference between the oxic and euxinic zones (~ 90 and 20 nM, respectively), and Zn shows a small decrease with depth (from ~1600 to 1300 nM). Of the elements analyzed, Mo is the only one that exhibits a large decrease from the oxic to euxinic zones (from ~ 180 to 10 nM). The 4-m chemocline between the oxic and euxinic zones over which dramatic changes in trace element concentration occur in FGL is where peak concentrations for several elements are found, including Fe (3.2 µM), Zn (3.1 µM), Co (86 nM), and V (72 nM). The largest peak is observed for Mn, with a peak concentration of 61 µM, and a transition zone that extends well into the overlying mixolimnion and mirrors the decline in oxygen concentration. Manganese concentration peaks in chemoclines have been observed in a variety of stratified systems that exhibit a gap between the decrease in dissolved oxygen and the increase in sulfide concentration, presumably the result of limited vertical mixing and microbially mediated Mn cycling. We elucidate the link between the gap in the presence of dissolved oxygen and sulfide to microbial community structure, and the effects of speciation on dissolved element concentration in oxic versus euxinic zones. Furthermore, modeling efforts disambiguate the influences of mixing and biology on dissolved trace element concentration in the water column.",

Currently, the Earth and the Moon are the only bodies on which in-situ surface heat flow measurements have been performed. Here, strong spatial variations of the surface heat flow are primarily caused by plate tectonics and the heterogeneous distribution of heat producing elements (HPE) over the surface (e.g., the so-called PKT region on the lunar nearside). In the absence of plate-tectonics and large-scale geochemical anomalies, on Mars, surface heat flow is expected to vary less with geological location, being mainly influenced by variations in the thickness and HPE content of the crust [1], and by mantle plumes [2].\nWe have tested this assumption by running thermal evolution models for Mars in 3D spherical geometry [3]. In our calculations, we use a crust of fixed thickness with a north-south dichotomy in crustal thickness, a low conductivity compared to the mantle and enriched in radiogenic heat producing elements. Our results show that including compressibility effects, phase transitions and different core sizes, surface heat flow variations are mainly dominated by the crust contribution, unless the mantle viscosity increases more than three orders of magnitude with depth. In the latter case, heat flow variations due to mantle upwellings are ~8 mW/m2relative to surface average and remain confined to limited surface regions (Fig. 1). Further, we use constraints from elastic thickness estimates [4] and geoid [5] to choose a best-fit model for the present-day Martian mantle. Both surface heat flow variations on Mars obtained from numerical models and the heat flow measurement planned for the InSight mission will permit to address the question of a possible plume underneath Elysium and also to test the feasibility of present-day volcanism on Mars.\n[1] Hahn et al., GRL, 2011; [2] Kiefer & Li, GRL, 2009; [3] Hüttig & Stemmer, PEPI, 2008; [4] Phillips et al., Science, 2008; [5] Wieczorek & Zuber, JGR, 2004.\nFig. 1 Surface heat flow variations after 4.5 Ga of thermal evolution.",

Accurately estimating emissions from different fire types in various ecosystems is crucial to predicting and mitigating the impact of fires on air quality. The physical properties of ecosystems’ fuelbeds can heavily influence the combustion processes (e.g. flaming or smoldering) and the resultant emissions. However, despite recent progress in characterizing the composition of biomass smoke, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding the linkage between basic fuelbed physical properties and emissions. In laboratory experiments we examined the effects of fuelbed properties on combustion efficiency (CE) and emissions for an important fuel component of temperate and boreal forests – conifer needles. The bulk density (BD), depth (DZ), and moisture content (MC) of Ponderosa Pine needle fuelbeds were manipulated in 75 burns for which gas and particle emissions were measured. We found CE was negatively correlated with BD, DZ and MC and that the emission factors of species associated with smoldering combustion processes (CO, CH4, particles) were positively correlated with these fuelbed properties. The study indicates the physical properties of conifer needle fuelbeds have a significant effect on CE and hence emissions. However, many of the emission models used to predict and manage smoke impacts on air quality assume conifer litter burns by flaming combustion with a high CE and correspondingly low emissions of CO, CH4, particles, and organic compounds. Our results suggest emission models underestimate emissions from fires involving a large component of conifer needles. Additionally, our findings indicate that laboratory studies of emissions should carefully control fuelbed physical properties to avoid confounding effects that may obscure the effects being tested and lead to erroneous interpretations.",

            "abstract": "Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) has been shown to be an important component of non-refractory submicron aerosol in the atmosphere. The presence of SOA can influence the earth’s radiative balance by contributing to the absorption and scattering of radiation and by altering the properties of clouds. Globally, a large fraction of SOA originates from biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), emissions of which depend on vegetation cover and climate. Temperature, CO2 concentration, and land use and land cover change have been shown to be major drivers of global isoprene emission changes in future climates. Additionally, the SOA concentration in the atmosphere not only depends on BVOC emissions, but is also controlled by anthropogenic emissions, temperature, precipitation and the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere. To project the change in SOA concentrations in the future requires a model that fully couples a BVOC emission model that represents these BVOC emission drivers, together with a sophisticated atmospheric model of SOA formation and properties. Recent studies have suggested that traditional parameterized SOA formation mechanisms that are tuned to fit smog chamber data do not fully account for the complexity and dynamics of real SOA system, calling into the question of the validity and completeness of previous SOA projections.\nIn this study, we investigate the response of SOA mass to future physical climate change, to land cover and land use change, to changes in BVOCs emissions, and to changes in anthropogenic aerosol and gas species emissions for the year 2100, utilizing a global climate-aerosol model (CAM5-IMPACT): the NCAR Community Atmospheric Model (CAM5) coupled with a global aerosol model (IMPACT). The IMPACT model has sophisticated detailed process-based mechanisms describing aerosol microphysics and SOA formation through both gas phase and multiphase reactions. We perform sensitivity tests to isolate the relative roles of individual global change drivers. The anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions are adopted from representative concentration pathways (RCP) scenarios for future (year 2100) simulations. Biogenic VOC species are predicted from MEGAN 2.1 (Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature, version 2.1) embedded in NCAR Community Land Model (CLM4.5).",

            "abstract": "The Farnsworth hydrocarbon field in northern Texas has been an experimental site for CO2 sequestration and enhanced oil recovery for the U.S. Department of Energy-sponsored Southwest Partnership (SWP) since April, 2013. CO2 is to be injected into the Pennsylvanian Morrow Sandstone at a rate of 200,000 tonnes per year for at least five years. The Morrow is a quartz-rich sandstone that lies at a depth of about 2400 m. Pore water in the Morrow has a total dissolved solids content of about 3600 mg/L dominated by Na, Cl, bicarbonate, and Ca. A reactive solute transport model was constructed for a 1700 × 1700 × 95 m volume using the TOUGHREACT software and the ECO2N equation of state for aqueous brine and CO2. Simulations were carried out to 100 years. The results showed immiscible CO2 gas to be concentrated in a lateral plume extending radially from the well screen, its ascent impeded by vigorous lateral groundwater flow in the more permeable upper Morrow. CO2 was much more widespread in aqueous solution, lowering pH throughout much of the model volume after 100 years, to a minimum of about 4.7. The low reactivity of the Morrow Sandstone due to its quartz-rich matrix and dilute pore fluid resulted in little mineral precipitation or dissolution, with net volume changes for any mineral no higher than order 10−4. The simulations predicted net dissolution of albite, calcite, and chlorite, and net precipitation of dawsonite, illite, and magnesite. The Morrow matrix was predicted to undergo slight net dissolution overall, resulting in porosity increases of up to 0.01%, suggesting that the Morrow would be resistant to significant changes in hydraulic properties as a result of the proposed amount of CO2 injection. For the 100 year simulation times calculated thus far, only a small fraction of the injected CO2 would be sequestered as carbonate minerals, with most of the injected CO2 dissolved in the aqueous phase.",

            "abstract": "Belkovsky Island is the part of New Siberian Island (NSI) terrane for which the paleomagnetic results for O-S periods were obtained previosly [1]. Its outcrops present the Paleozoic volcanic and sedimentary sequences intruded by mafic sills and dikes. The age of formation of igneous rocks is 252±2 Ma [2], which matches to the time of Siberian trap magmatism. The study was carried out on 45 samples from two dolerite sills at the Laboratory of Geodynamics and Paleomagnetism of IPGG SB RAS. The NRM in samples ranges from 30 mA/m to 400 mA/m. AF demagnetization allowed to remove the viscouse remanent magnetization at 5-10 nT field and then only one component is isolated. 90% NRM destroys in field up to 80-100 nT, MDF is about 30 nT that suppose the presence of low coercive minerals. The site mean directions were calculated for Sill 1 (Ds=35.7°, Is=-79.7°, K=64, α95=4.2) and Sill 2 (Ds=214.2°, Is=81.4°, K=145.4, α95=4.0). Considering high paleolatitudes (70.0°-72.4°) we suppose that NSI terrane should be in North hemisphere that’s why Sill 1 formed in reversed polarity epoch and Sill 2 formed in the normal one. Taking into account this fact the VGPs were calculated for Sill 1: Plat=57.5°, Plong = 113.9°, dp/dm=8.0/7.7; for Sill 2: Plat=60.4°, Plong = 116.5°, dp/dm=7.7/7.5. To summarize we can conclude preliminarily that NSI terrane at Permian-Triassic time was located to the north from Siberia and the mafic rocks of Belkovsky Island can belong to the marginal part of P-T trap formation. The VGP position suppose significant rotation relatively to Siberia before accretion to it in J-K time and it’s most likely that in the Late Paleozoic and Early Mesozoic NSI terrane migrate in Arctic latitudes together with other fragments of Arctida.\nThe work was supported by grant RFBR 14-05-31399.\nLeterature:\n1.

            "abstract": "The partitioning of precipitation within the forest canopy into throughfall and stemflow is controlled by biotic and abiotic factors, which include storm characteristics (e.g., intensity, duration, and magnitude) and canopy structural parameters. Our research uses novel applications of weather map classification to relate synoptic scale weather patterns to the surface environment. A daily synoptic calendar was developed in the Mid-Atlantic (USA) to categorize the subcanopy hydrologic and biogeochemical fluxes during storm events in an eastern deciduous forest. Synoptic classification identified 6 low pressure systems, 4 high pressure systems, 1 cold front, 3 northerly flow regimes, 3 southerly flow regimes, and 5 weak patterns across 4 seasons. The low pressure systems were commonly associated with the largest average flux-based enrichment ratios of solutes in throughfall and stemflow compared to rainfall solute concentrations. Low pressures such as the Weak Coastal Low, centered off the Mid-Atlantic coast with easterly winds over the study region, were associated with large rainfall events with moderate intensities falling over a long period of time. This combination of meteorological conditions allowed complete washoff of antecedent atmospheric deposition and maximum canopy leaching as storm systems of this magnitude were able to wet the entire canopy. The lowest flux-based enrichment ratios occurred during the passage of cold fronts and under weak southwest flow regimes, which were both characterized by moderately high rainfall amounts that occurred over short periods of time (i.e., < 0.5 days) with high intensities (i.e., > 5 mm h-1). As a result, the water from these storm systems passed through the forest canopy very quickly and with minimal contact time thus resulting in minimal enrichment of throughfall and stemflow. The distinct chemical signatures of synoptic types provide evidence that this novel application of storm classification in forest hydrology is useful for estimating hydrologic and nutrient fluxes in eastern forests and modeling forest water and nutrient budgets in response to changing precipitation characteristics in the region.",

            "abstract": "The 2014 seismic sequence in Northern Chile culminated with the Mw8.1 Pisagua earthquake (2014/04/01), rapidly followed by a large aftershock close to Iquique (Mw=7.6, 2014/04/03). A detailed analysis of these two earthquakes is required to better relate these major events with their preparatory phase, and in particular with the intense activity of the area between March 16th and April 1st. This area has been densely instrumented by several international and Chilean projects, including strong motion and broadband sensors as well as high-rate GPS stations. In this study, we make an extensive use of the seismo-geodetic data collected by the IPOC/CSN (http://www.ipoc-network.org/) and ONEMI networks. In a first step, we model several of the foreshocks with magnitudes in the range [5.5 6.5] in order to determine a seismic velocity model able to reproduce the observations up to 0.1Hz. This velocity model is then used to analyze the rupture process of the two main shocks. Besides the use of the local displacement waveforms (coming from strong motion sensors and high-rate GPS), the inversion procedure also includes the static GPS displacements and the teleseismic P and SH waves. The source models are finally validated with other geophysical information not included in the inversion, such as InSAR or surface waves analysis through an empirical Green function approach. These data consistently show that most of the coseismic slip of the 1st April main shock is located in a 50km long zone (along strike), close and South from the hypocenter. In the time domain, this large slip patch has been activated 15-20s after origin time and lasted about 30s. Before this activation, seismic moment release was low and rupture remained in the hypocentral region. Differences and relations between the two shocks, as well as their interpretation in the 2014 seismic sequence, will be discussed.",

These include 3m and 6m vibrocoring systems; a 5m combined rockdrill and vibrocorer system; an oriented drill designed specifically to recover samples for use in palaeomagnetic studies; and a 55m rockdrill (RockDrill2).\nRecently, BGS have developed an autonomous, battery-operated vibrocoring system compatible with both the 3m and 6m vibrocorers, which can be used in water depths up to 6000m. Use of a battery system negates the use of an umbilical power cable to operate the vibrocorer, which instead can be deployed using the vessels A-frame and winch. The autonomous battery system comprises six 48V 19Ah batteries connected in series to give a 288V power source, a microprocessor and real-time clock. Data from the sensors are recorded with a time-stamp, giving diagnostic information that can be downloaded once the system is returned to the deck. The vibrocorer is operated via a pre-set program which is set up before deployment.\nThe new system not only allows vibrocoring in greater water depths, but can also be used on smaller vessels where deck space is limited as a separate winch and umbilical is not required. The autonomous system was used for the first time in June 2014 on-board the R\\V Belgica to acquire samples from 20 sites in the Dangeard and Explorer canyon heads, off the southwest of England in 430m water depth.\nAnother development is the BGS 55m rockdrill (RockDrill2),  a remotely operated sampling system capable of coring up to 55m below sea floor in water depths up to  4000m. The rockdrill can be operated via its own launch and recovery system and can be outfitted with additional sensors such as gas flow meters, which have been designed by the BGS for assessing volume of gas hydrate, and down-hole logging tools.\nThe 55m rockdrill has recently been used to sample hydrate-entrained sediments in the Sea of Japan.  The maximum coring depth achieved was 32m below sea floor and the system can operate for more than 50 hours on a single deployment. The BGS system will be used in conjunction with the Bremen University (MARUM) MeBo sea-floor rockdrill on future International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) expeditions.",

Seven foraminiferal biofacies were identified and planktonic/ benthic (P/B) foraminiferal ratios were calculated to estimate water-depth changes and evaluate paleoceanographic conditions. The biofacies are characterized by a change from exclusively agglutinated to more calcareous forms, with the transition starting at 51.9 Ma. Foraminiferal abundances, nannofossil and CaCO3 content are low for the interval between 54.0-51.5 Ma. Above 51 Ma, calcareous foraminifers, such as Dentalina, Nodosaria, Lenticulina, Cibicides, Elphidium, and Bulimina spp. become abundant within many intervals as well as a long-term increase in nanofossil and CaCO3 content occurs. Higher P/B ratios occur in samples < 51 Ma although they vary throughout the early and middle Eocene.\nOur data indicate a gradual change from: 1) shallow, poorly ventilated waters before 51.9 Ma; 2) slightly deeper and better ventilated waters occurred between 51.9 and 49.0 Ma; and 3) a transition from inner and middle/ outer neritic environments, with generally better ventilated conditions after 49.0 Ma. This is concomitant with a change in sedimentation rates from 164 m/myr between 52.7 and 51.7 Ma to 18 m/myr at 41.0 Ma. As shallow-water depths occur throughout this section, sedimentation rates from Site 1171 can be used as a proxy for subsidence for the eastern side of the nascent Tasman Seaway. Taken together these data suggest an early episode of high subsidence (e.g., possible crustal thinning) occurred between 52.7 and 51.7 Ma, with final rifting resulting in deep-water flow starting during the Late Eocene to earliest Oligocene.",

            "abstract": "In this presentation we assess the impact of in situ and satellite sea surface salinity (SSS) observations on seasonal to interannual variability of tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean dynamics as well as on dynamical ENSO forecasts using a Hybrid Coupled Model (HCM) for 1993-2007 (cf., Hackert et al., 2011) and August 2011 until February 2014 (cf., Hackert et al., 2014). The HCM is composed of a primitive equation ocean model coupled with a SVD-based statistical atmospheric model for the tropical Indo-Pacific region. An Ensemble Reduced Order Kalman Filter (EROKF) is used to assimilate observations to constrain dynamics and thermodynamics for initialization of the HCM.\nIncluding SSS generally improves NINO3 sea surface temperature anomaly validation. Assimilating SSS gives significant improvement versus just subsurface temperature for all forecast lead times after 5 months. We find that the positive impact of SSS assimilation is brought about by surface freshening in the western Pacific warm pool that leads to increased barrier layer thickness (BLT) and shallower mixed layer depths. Thus, in the west the net effect of assimilating SSS is to increase stability and reduce mixing, which concentrates the wind impact of ENSO coupling. Specifically, the main benefit of SSS assimilation for 1993-2007 comes from improvement to the Spring Predictability Barrier (SPB) period. In the east, the impact of Aquarius satellite SSS is to induce more cooling in the NINO3 region as a result of being relatively more salty than in situ SSS in the eastern Pacific leading to increased mixing and entrainment. This, in turn, sets up an enhanced west to east SST gradient and intensified Bjerknes coupling. For the 2011-2014 period, consensus coupled model forecasts compiled by the IRI tend to erroneously predict NINO3 warming; SSS assimilation corrects this defect. Finally, we plan to update our analysis and report on the dynamical impact of including Aquarius SSS for the most-recent, ongoing 2014 El Niño in the tropical Pacific and compare these results with other available coupled models that do not yet include satellite SSS.",

            "abstract": "In exhumed megathrust analogues, deformation is partitioned between continuous and discontinuous deformation structures, commonly reflecting partitioning between concurrent frictional and viscous shear. This partitioning is a function of material properties, strain rate, and fluid pressure distribution. Mineral strength and preferred deformation mechanism vary down-dip as a function of temperature and pressure; however, incoming sediment composition, roughness of the sea floor, and the relative proportions of competent and incompetent material, all affect bulk rheology, and may vary both with depth and along strike.\nFluid pressure varies with depth, but also along strike if fluid sources and/or permeability vary along the margin. At the locations of major dehydration reactions, localized peaks in fluid pressure occur if permeability is low. These zones of low effective stress may allow for frictional sliding in rocks normally deforming by viscous shearing flow, and could relate to zones of tremor and slow slip. Frictional sliding and possible associated tensile fractures would, however, allow fluid escape, resulting in fluid pressure fluctuations and a time-dependent interplay between continuous and discontinuous deformation.\nLocally elevated effective stress increases frictional strength, promoting failure by viscous mechanisms. If this is true, and representative of large-scale megathrust behavior, then decreased fluid pressure may promote creep. In a fluid-saturated, tabular fault zone with small grain size, this creep can take place by pressure solution creep at subgreenschist conditions. If pressure solution is the active mineral deformation mechanism, and shear is distributed though a tabular zone, viscous shearing flow at plate boundary rates is possible at temperatures significantly less than required for the onset of dislocation creep in quartzofeldspathic rocks. In a wide shear zone, such viscous flow may occur at low differential stress. A hypothesis to consider, consistent with field observations of coexisting frictional sliding and pressure solution creep, is then that locked megathrust segments have relatively low effective stress and prefer frictional over viscous deformation, whereas creeping segments have higher effective stress and dominantly deform viscously.",

Artificial groundwater recharge application to the water curtain cultivation facilities was adopted and tested to use groundwater sustainably in a rural region of Korea. The groundwater level in the test site shows natural trend corresponding rainfall pattern except during mid-November to early April when groundwater levels decline sharply due to groundwater abstraction for water curtain cultivation. Groundwater levels are also affected by surface water such as stream, small dams in the stream and agricultural ditches. Infiltration data were collected from lysimeter installation and monitoring inside and outside water cultivation facility and compared with each other. The infiltration data were well correlated with rainfall outside the facility, but the data in the facility showed very different from the other. The missing infiltration data were attributed to groundwater level rise and level sensor location below water table. Soil water contents in the unsaturated zone indicated rainfall infiltration propagation at depth and with time outside the facility. According to rainfall amount and water condition at the initial stage of a rainfall event, the variation of soil water content was shown differently. Soil water contents and electrical conductivities were closely correlated with each other, and they reflected rainfall infiltration through the soil and water quality changes. The monitoring results are useful to reveal the hydrological processes from the infiltration to groundwater recharge, and water management planning in the water cultivation areas.",

            "abstract": "A number of tsunami like events occurred in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea during 23 to 27 June 2014. First location to be struck was Ciutadella harbor (the Balearic Islands, Spain), where 1-m high oscillations were observed in the early morning hours of 23 June. Two days later (25 June), during morning to afternoon hours, four bays in the Adriatic Sea were hit by tsunami waves with wave-heights of up to 3 m. These waves were accompanied by strong destructive currents. The same day, a phenomenon locally known as \"marrobbio\" occurred on the western coast of Sicily: a strong tidal bore with wave heights of >1.5 m propagated inside the Mazara River inlet, damaging moored vessels. Finally, at the midday of 27 June, a sudden tsunami-like wave swept beaches in Odessa, the Black Sea (Ukraine) injuring a number of beach-goers. All of these events were associated with abrupt air pressure changes of > 2 hPa/5 min), and may be classified as meteorological tsunamis. Analysis of troposphere conditions revealed that this chain of events has a mutual origin and is related to a unique synoptic system which traversed the Mediterranean and the Black Sea during 23-27 June 2014. The pattern was characterized by: (i) weak surface cyclone; (ii) an inflow of a warm and dry African air at heights of ~850 hPa, (iii) very strong southern-southwestern mid-troposphere jet stream (wind speeds of 20-40 m/s) which was (iv) embedded into unstable atmospheric layers at heights of 700-400 hPa. Described conditions support generation and trapping of atmospheric gravity waves (whose surface manifestation are distinct air pressure disturbances) at a forefront of a jet stream. Trapped atmospheric gravity waves are \"transported\" by the jet stream, thus propagating with its speed and direction. Mapping of Froude number, Fr = U/c, where U is the jet stream speed, and c is the long-wave speed, and analysis of events and tide-gauge records indicated that strongest sea level oscillations were observed at resonant areas for which Fr ~ 0.9-1.1.",

            "abstract": "Records of geochemical cycling of bio-essential, redox-sensitive elements have keys to decipher mysteries of the co-evolution of Earth and life. To obtain insight into biogeochemical cycling of those elements and early evolution of microbial biosphere from high-quality samples, we drilled through Mesoarchean strata in coastal Pilbara (Dixon Island-Cleaverville Drilling Project, see Yamaguchi et al., 2009; Kiyokawa et al., 2012), and obtained 3.2 Ga old drillcores (CL1, CL2, and DX) of sulfide-rich black shales in the Cleaverville Group, Pilbara Supergroup. We conducted a systematic geochemical study involving sequential extractions of Fe, S, C, and N for phase-dependent contents (e.g., pyrite-Fe, reactive-Fe, highly reactive-Fe, unreactive-Fe, pyrite-S, sulfate-S, organic-S, elemental-S, Corg, Ccarb, Norg, and Nclay) and their stable isotope compositions, micro FT-IR and laser Raman spectroscopy for extracted kerogen, in addition to major and trace (redox-sensitive; e.g., Mo) element analysis, for >100 samples. Here we integrate our recent multidisciplinary investigations into the redox state of ocean and nature of microbial biosphere in the ocean 3.2 Ga ago. All of the obtained data are very difficult to explain only by geochemical processes in strictly anoxic environments, where both atmosphere and oceans were completely anoxic, like an environment before the inferred “Great Oxidation Event” when pO2 was lower than 0.00001 PAL (e.g., Holland, 1994). Our extensive data set consistently suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis, bacterial sulfate reduction, and microbially mediated redox-cycling of nitrogen, possibly involving denitrification and N2-fixation, are very likely to have been operating, and may be used as a strong evidence for at least local and temporal existence of oxidized environment as far back as 3.2 Ga ago. Modern-style biogeochemical cycling of Fe, S, C, N, and Mo has been operating since then. The atmosphere-hydrosphere system 3.2 Ga ago would have been sufficiently oxidized to allow redox-cycling of elements during deposition of the sediments, ~800 Ma earlier than commonly thought. Our suggestions have far-reaching and astrobiological implications for earlier evolution of the surface environment, especially redox state, and marine microbial biosphere.",

            "abstract": "Persistent seismicity recorded within the Askja segment of the Northern Volcanic Rift Zone of Iceland since 2007 by a network of up to 55 three-component broadband seismometers reveals melt transport in distinct regions at 20 km depth in the mid crust. The bulk of the seismicity occurs beneath the main central volcano but significant seismicity exists in two other, distinct, locations. The cluster located beneath Vadalda, a shield volcano to the east of Askja, experienced a swarm in December 2012 during which more 50% of the total earthquakes in this cluster occurred. Accurate earthquake locations have been generated using hand picked arrival times and cross-correlation techniques in combination with HypoDD. This has revealed that events within the seismic swarm all occurred at a single depth in the crust and migrated ~2.5 km to the southwest over a four week period. We interpret this as a sill intruding laterally into the mid-crust. \n\nThe swarm culminated in intense seismicity on the 26th December with over 50 earthquakes in a two hour period. Each of these earthquakes produced identical waveforms and locate in exactly the same place. This implies a repeating mechanism causing the earthquakes. The fault plane solution of the repeating event is well constrained but is an unusual mechanism, consisting of either a vertical or a horizontal fault plane. This is highly unusual for a tectonic mechanism, further suggesting that the movement of melt along a sub-horizontal sill is driving the microseismicity. An earthquake which occurred three days before the final swarm has a similar waveform but is larger in magnitude. We interpret this as the initial event which opened a conduit, with the subsequent repeating earthquakes occurring when the flow rate was sufficiently low to allow cooling of the melt through the glass transition and induce brittle failure.",

Our map allows for the compilation and examination of Late Glacial Maximum (LGM) paleo-ice sheet/stream flow directions developed upon the seafloor from the preservation of: mega-scale glacial lineations, drumlinized features, and selective linear erosion. We combine this with terrestrial observations of flow direction to place constraints on ice divides and accumulation centers (ice domes). The results show a flow divergence in Larsen B embayment, between flow emanating off the Seal Nunataks (including Robertson Island) that directed ice in a southeast direction, then easterly as the flow transits toward the Robertson Trough. A second, stronger “streaming flow” directed ice southeasterly then southward, as ice overflowed the Jason Peninsula to reach the Jason Trough, the southern perimeter of the embayment. This reconstruction is far more detailed than other recent compilations because we followed specific flow indicators and have kept tributary flow paths parallel. Our reconstitution also refines the extent of at least five other distinct paleo-ice stream systems which in turn serve to delineate seven broad regions where ice domes must have been centered across the continental shelf during the LGM.",

            "abstract": "Many landscapes are comprised of a variety of vegetation types with different canopy structure, rooting depth, physiological characteristics, soil/substrate conditions, etc. Even in agricultural regions, different management practices, including crop rotations, irrigation scheduling, planting density, seed varieties, tilling practices, and other factors result in complex patterns in vegetation growth stages, canopy cover, canopy architecture, cropping densities and understory soil/substrate properties. This variability at the canopy, field and landscape scale, makes it very challenging  to reliably quantify spatially-distributed surface fluxes. This paper describes a robust but relatively simple thermal-based energy balance model that parameterizes the key soil/substrate and vegetation exchange processes affecting the radiative balance and turbulent energy transport with the overlying atmosphere. The thermal-based model, called the Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model solves for the soil/substrate and canopy temperatures that achieves a balance in the radiation and turbulent heat flux exchange with the lower atmosphere for the soil/substrate and vegetation elements. The TSEB scheme permits interaction between soil/substrate and canopy elements which are both are coupled to the atmosphere via canopy-air temperature that is strongly correlated to the aerodynamic surface temperature. In doing so the TSEB modeling framework is applicable to a wide range in atmospheric and land cover conditions. An overview of applications of the TSEB modeling framework to a variety of landscapes will be presented that include both natural and agricultural ecosystems having a soil/substrate with standing water (flooded), snow covered and vegetated (canopy understory) requiring different levels of refinements to the TSEB formulations for these unique land cover conditions. In addition, examples using a modeling framework that allows the TSEB scheme to be applied at regional scales using geostationary and polar orbiting satellites with a data fusion technique will be presented.",

Like many science disciplines, the volume of data being archived in planetary science is reaching epic proportions and many of the delivery mechanisms that were feasible in the past (e.g., low-speed networks, hard media) are no longer practical. In addition, as data are recalibrated or data collections are extended due to continued mission operations, redelivery of the same data and the resulting duplicative storage of said data exhausts limited resources. With the PDS4 data model there is an opportunity for the NSSDCA to provide additional services to the PDS such as the preservation, tracking, and restoration of individual products (e.g., a specific data file or document), which was unfeasible in the previous PDS3 system. At the same time, however, many ongoing missions will continue to archive their data as PDS3 products. All of this has necessitated a revamping of the NSSDCA Information Model that is flexible enough to provide new services and increased efficiency for PDS4 products while not interrupting the ingest process for PDS3 products.\nWe will report on our progress and status.",

            "abstract": "The impact of sea level rise (SLR) on hurricane storm surge and wind-waves is a non-linear process (Bilskie et al., 2014). Using a high-resolution physics-based numerical model, we examine shelf wave dynamics in general and a shelf anomaly in particular under global climate change scenarios, which include SLR and potential hurricane intensification. To begin it is noted that Hurricane Dennis (2005) produced local storm surge in Apalachee Bay of six to ten feet, but the National Hurricane Center advisory for the region forecast only four to six feet of storm surge. This forecast was based on the relatively weak wind forcing along the west Florida shelf, but the additional storm-induced surge was caused by a remotely forced shelf wave that propagated along the Florida shelf as a topographic Rossby wave (Morey et al.,2006).\nThese mesoscale processed are studied under climate change scenarios using a state-of-the-art wind-waved hurricane storm surge model (SWAN+ADCIRC) of the northern Gulf of Mexico that encompasses the off-shore regions including the western North Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico. The finitie element model penetrates the shoreline along Florida’s “Big Bend” region, the Florida panhandle, Alabama, and the Mississippi coast with high resolution that is sufficient to describe the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, for example. The large domain and fine mesh resolution included in the model permits the description, and non-linear interaction, of the physics associated with wind-generated waves and hurricane storm surge that produce storm-induced anomalies such as the Rossby wave generated during Hurricane Dennis. Examination of various wave statistics such as significant wave height, mean wave period and direction, and wave radiation stress gradients provide insight into future behavior of storm-induced shelf wave dynamics under global climate change scenarios. This study may impact future statistics and probability distributions for analysis of flood risk by including parameters for shelf wave dynamics.",

Combining the ERA-Interim reanalysis and satellite aerosol observations, we define a NLLJ detection method and show the climatologic characteristics of NLLJ over the Taklimakan Desert for the first time. The NLLJs frequently occur more than 55% of nights, are primarily easterly and northeasterly wind, and typically appear at 120-400 m with the speed of 4-10 ms-1. It is also found that the most NLLJs are situated above the top of the inversion during summer season while embedded in the inversion layer during winter. Although the NLLJs appear all year long over the Taklimakan Desert, composite studies shown that the NLLJs can only play an important role for the dust emission during summer and autumn. Due to weak NLLJ and convection, less momentum can be mixed down for dust emission in winter and spring.",

            "abstract": "Black carbon particles (BC) strongly absorb solar radiation and may be the second largest contributor to global warming after greenhouses gases. However, the magnitude of the climate forcing by BC is quite uncertain, with a global average value estimated up to + 1.1Wm2. There is limited long term BC field data that can be used to validate global models to estimate the radiative forcing. Here we report (1) the measurements of BC concentrations, [BC], on filters collected weekly over 47 years, from 1964 to 2010 at Kevo, Finland (69o 45' N, 27o 02' E), (2) the se-asonal and long term trends, (3) the relative impact of potential source regions of BC and (4) compare the [BC] with the values calculated by the OsloCTM3model that simulates BC transport and removal rates and emission inventories as input.\nBC Concentrations were determined in weekly aerosol samples collected on Whatman 42 or Glass fiber filters using optical and/or thermal optical methods. The data so obtained provides the longest record of BC measurements. The highest annual mean concentrations were observed in 1965-1966, 670ng m-3 (local wood burning may have contributed at that time). Concentrations decreased sharply, averaging ~300 ng m-3 during 1967-80, ~250 ng m-3 for 1981- 90, ~140 for 1991-2000, and ~100 ng m-3 for 2001-10. From 1970 to 2010 the concentration decreased by 78% or 1.8% per yr. The highest concentrations were observed in winter, and the lowest in summer. Model calculations using the OsloCTM3 yield BC values ~4 times lower than those observed between 1998 and 2008, however the time-trend is reproduced quite faithfully. The model underestimates BC for the earlier periods as well. There are limitations in global models to reproduce Arctic surface concentration, but the comparison of model and observations might also indicate that the emissions in source regions are underestimated. It can be used to improve historical emission inventories for the regions affecting the surface concentration in the European Arctic. Revised emission inventories will impact the radiative forcing trend calculations, including the snow albedo effect.",

It affects and impacts human society in different ways, depending on the underlying socioeconomic vulnerability of specific places, social groups, households and individuals. This differential vulnerability presents spatial and temporal variations, and is rooted in historical patterns of development and relations between human and ecological systems. This study aims to assess the impact of climate variability on livelihoods and well-being, as well as their changes over time and across space, and for rural and urban populations. The geographic focus is Southern Brazil–the states of Parana, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul-- and the objectives include (a) to identify and map critical areas or hotspots of exposure to climate variability (temperature and precipitation), and (b) to identify internal variation or differential vulnerability within these areas and its evolution over time (1980-2010), using newly available integrated data from the Terra Populus project.

            "abstract": "Energy, water, and land systems interact in many ways and are impacted by management and climate change. These systems and their interactions often differ in significant ways from region-to-region. To explore the coupled energy-water-land system and its relation to climate change and management a simple conceptual model of demand, endowment and technology (DET) is proposed. A consistent and comparable analysis framework is needed as climate change and resource management practices have the potential to impact each DET element, resource, and region differently. These linkages are further complicated by policy and trade agreements where endowments of one region are used to meet demands in another. This paper reviews the unique DET characteristics of land, energy and water resources across the United States. Analyses are conducted according to the eight geographic regions defined in the 2014 National Climate Assessment. Evident from the analyses are regional differences in resources endowments in land (strong East-West gradient in forest, cropland and desert), water (similar East-West gradient), and energy. Demands likewise vary regionally reflecting differences in population density and endowment (e.g., higher water use in West reflecting insufficient precipitation to support dryland farming). The effect of technology and policy are particularly evident in differences in the energy portfolios across the eight regions. Integrated analyses that account for the various spatial and temporal differences in regional energy, water and land systems are critical to informing effective policy requirements for future energy, climate and resource management.\n Sandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.",

The morning main oval arc shows energies around 200 keV, the main oval in the kink region has energies near 100 keV, while the 'flare' emissions poleward of the main oval are characterized by electrons in the 50-75 keV range. The Io and Ganymede footprints are also visible in these observations. The Io spectrum shows a very weak attenuation while the Ganymede spectrum shows a significant hydrocarbon absorption. These footprints need a specific model to derive the primary electron energy associated with their emission.\nThis anisotropy in the properties of the auroral electrons is a key point for the understanding of the acceleration processes responsible for the aurora, and an important constraint for all ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling models under development.\na & b labels on the figure correspond to the observed brightness and mean energy for 2 observations, respectively.",

            "abstract": "The East-African rift associates lithospheric thinning with extensive volcanism. Melts, even at low fractions, reduce the mantle viscosity. They also carry and exchange heat, mainly via reactions (latent heat), modifying the temperature and the rheology, which in turn controls their transport through the lithospheric mantle. Analysis of microstructures and crystal preferred orientations of mantle xenoliths from different localities along the East-African rift system highlights strong feedbacks between deformation, melt transport, and thermal evolution in the lithospheric mantle. Microstructures change markedly from south (young) to north (mature rift). In Tanzania, mylonitic to porphyroclastic peridotites predominate in on-axis localities, while off-axis ones are coarse-granular to porphyroclastic, pointing to heterogeneous deformation and variable annealing due to local interaction with fluids or to different time lags between deformation and extraction. Mylonites point to strain localization but there is no evidence for dominant grain boundary sliding: ubiquituous intracrystalline deformation in olivine and orthopyroxene and strong CPO record dislocation creep with dominant [100] glide in olivine. Synkinematic replacement of opx by olivine in both mylonitic and porphyroclastic peridotites suggests that deformation continued in the presence of melt under near-solidus conditions. This heating was transient: exsolutions in opx record cooling before extraction. Mega peridotites, which sample the southern border of the Ethiopian plateau, are coarse-porphyroclastic and show widespread metasomatism by basalts or by evolved volatile-rich low melt fractions. The former predated or was coeval to deformation, since olivine and pyroxene CPO are coherent. Exsolutions in opx imply that the high primary equilibration temperatures, which are consistent with the coarse-grained microstructures, are linked to transient heating. Finally, the fine-grained polygonal microstructures, with evenly distributed interstitial pyroxenes aligned in the foliation, and weak but uncorrelated olivine and pyroxenes CPO in xenoliths from the Gulf of Aden margin record post kinematic reactive melt percolation and refertilisation of the lithospheric mantle controlled by the preexisting fabric.",

            "abstract": "Solar geoengineering has been suggested as a tool that might reduce damages from an-\nthropogenic climate change. Analysis often assumes that geoengineering would be used to\nmaintain a constant global mean temperature. Under this scenario, geoengineering would\nbe required either indefinitely (on societal timescales) or until atmospheric CO2 concentra-\ntions were sufficiently reduced. Impacts of climate change, however, are related to the rate\nof change as well as its magnitude. We thus describe an alternate scenario in which solar\ngeoengineering is used only to constrain the rate of change of global mean temperature; this\nleads to a finite deployment period for any emissions pathway that stabilizes global mean\ntemperature. The length of deployment and amount of geoengineering required depend on\nthe emissions pathway and allowable rate of change, e.g. in our simulations, reducing the\nmaximum \u00180.3\u000eC/decade rate of change in an RCP4.5 pathway to 0.1\u000eC/decade would\nrequire geoengineering for 160 years; under RCP6.0 the required time nearly doubles. We\nfurther note that a decision to terminate use of solar geoengineering does not automatically\nimply rapid temperature increases: feedback could be used to limit rates of change in a\ngradual phase-out.\nSecond, we demonstrate that feedback control can limit rates of change in a climate\nmodel. This involves a related observation – in any future implementation, models used\nto predict behavior will not be perfect, and adjusting the level of solar geoengineering in\nresponse to climate observations is essential. This feedback process is thus essential for\nmanaging uncertainty (and is the answer to the question of how we can engineer a system\nthat we don’t fully understand). Once this feedback is included, however, meeting some\nparticular objective (such as a specified rate of change) can be achieved without an accurate\nmodel of the climate system.",

For each campaign, the precision and accuracy of the remote measurements of atmospheric CO2 differential absorption optical depths from the candidate instruments were evaluated with respect to corresponding modeled CO2 optical depths derived from in situ profiles of atmospheric state variables including atmospheric CO2 mixing ratios, temperature (T), pressure (p), and humidity (q) and using the HITRAN spectroscopic database. To enable this evaluation, the DC-8 flights were designed to include multiple overpasses of a comparison location where the aircraft performed a spiral ascent or descent and captured the in situ profiles using a suite of onboard instruments. However large segments of some flights took place far from spiral locations and therefore had no coincident in situ measurements of the atmospheric state (CO2, T, p, q). For these situations meterological analysis data from the Goddard Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) GEOS-5 gridded data have been used to assimilate atmospheric state profiles for use in the CO2 optical depth derivation. We use the location of the DC-8 spirals to identify all of the GMAO GEOS-5 gridded profiles that would compare with each spiral and report their differences with respect to the DC-8 in situ profiles. We show how these differences affect the modeled CO2 optical depth for the three campaigns and the impacts of these differences on the precision and accuracy evaluations of the remote CO2 measurements.",

            "abstract": "Feldspar minerals comprise 60% of the Earth’s crust, so it imperative that the properties of feldspar be well understood for seismic modeling. The structure of feldspar consists of a three-dimensional framework of strongly-bonded TO4 tetrahedra formed by the sharing of oxygen atoms between tetrahedra. The main solid solution series found in natural feldspars are alkali NaAlSi3O8 –KAlSi3O8 and plagioclase CaAl2Si2O8-NaAlSi3O8. Recently, efforts have been made to systematically quantify feldspars structural change at non-ambient temperatures by considering only the relative tilts of the tetrahedral framework [1]. This serves as a tool to predict various behaviors of the structure such as the relative anisotropy of unit cell parameters and volume evolution with composition and temperature. Monoclinic feldspars are well predicted by the model [1], but discrepancies still remain between the model predictions and real structures with respect to absolute values of the unit cell parameters. To improve the existing model, a modification must be made to account for the M-cation interaction with its surrounding oxygen atoms.\nWe have, therefore, chosen to study the structure of Pb-feldspar (PbAl2Si2O8), which provides the opportunity to characterize a monoclinic Al2Si2 feldspar containing a large M-site divalent cation using neutron diffraction. Neutron diffraction allows for the characterization of the M-site cation interaction between the oxygen atoms in the polyhedral cage by providing information to accurately determine the atomic displacement parameters..\nLead feldspar was synthesized for this study using the method described in [2], and confirmed to have a monoclinic C2/m space group. In this talk we will present structural determinations and atomic displacement parameters of Pb-feldspar from 10 – 300K generated from Neutron diffraction at the POWGEN beamline at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National lab, and compare our results to those predicted by the tetrahedral tilting model.\n[1] Angel, R.J.

            "abstract": "Sharp gradients in the entropy parameter PV5/3 tend to form naturally in Rice Convection Model (RCM) runs. Vasyliunas' equation implies intense sheets of Birkeland current at these sharp gradients, and we know that intense upward currents are associated with field-aligned potential drops and auroral arcs. The situation represents a local breakdown of the usual RCM assumption of perfectly conducting field lines and also implies a local decoupling of magnetospheric and ionospheric motions. We have had difficulty representing this decoupling in the RCM, because of difficulties resolving the thin structures on the large-scale grid. As a first step toward understanding the large-scale effects of the decoupling, we have found two highly idealized cases in which the RCM equations can be reduced to linear one-dimensional differential equations, which can easily be solved to high accuracy. Both cases assume steady state conditions and uniform ionospheric conductance, and the field-aligned potential drop is assumed to be proportional to the density of field-aligned current. One case involves region-2 current flowing on the inner edge of the plasma sheet, with convection considered as a small perturbation. The other considers a plasma boundary that makes an arbitrary angle with the gradient of flux tube volume, with the field-aligned potential considered as a small perturbation. In both cases, the main effects of field-aligned potential drops are: (i) to create zonal flows on the two sides of the arc, in the magnetosphere but not in the ionosphere; (ii) to reduce the overall arc-associated Birkeland current.",

            "abstract": "Vaccines are without question one of the most successful public health interventions the world has ever known. Despite this, for the past decade-and-a-half, industrialized countries around the world, from the United States to Germany and from Australia to Israel, have been confronted with specious panics about vaccine safety and efficacy, many of which center around claims that vaccines can cause autism. These fears can be traced to two events: a since-retracted paper published by a disgraced gastroenterologist claiming the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine was linked to a gut disease which, in turn, was linked to autism; and the United States's decision to remove a mercury-based preservative called thimerosal from standard pediatric vaccines in the late 1990s.\nThe effects of these scares are being felt worldwide. Each year for the past several years, the US has had more measles outbreaks than at any time since the mid-1990s, a fact which is especially frightening given that the WHO declared measles eliminated from North America in 2000. In France, a nationwide measles outbreak has caused thousands of hospitalizations and a number of deaths. I will address several issues central to this topic: Given the overwhelming amount of evidence showing vaccines are safe and the total lack of evidence showing they cause autism, why do these fears persist, and what can be done to combat them? Has the public health establishment's response to these fears been sufficient? To what extent do concerns about vaccines function as proxies for more opaque concerns regarding modern-day health care? And finally, what is the effect of a lack of evidence-based research on the best way to combat misinformation?",

            "abstract": "VLF waves are a useful diagnostic for D-region ionospheric disturbances due to their efficient global propagation. The D-region is too high for balloons, too low for satellites, and not ionized enough for radar reflections. Traditionally, ionosphere disturbances have been sensed using dedicated VLF transmitters allowing for only single propagation path analysis since there are only a handful of transmitters. \nA lightning stroke, however, releases an intense amount of VLF radio energy known as a Radio Atmospheric, or ‘sferic’ which propagates through the Earth-ionosphere waveguide. Lightning is globally spread and very frequent, so a sferic is therefore also a useful diagnostic of the D-region when ionized by solar flare x-ray bursts.\nWe present observations of lightning-generated sferics during strong solar flares. The advantage to using sferics is that many individual thunderstorms effectively act as separate VLF transmitting sources. During the solar flare there is a significant change in magnitude and frequency content of sferics. This disturbance varies with distance from the source. The difference in magnitude and arrival time of these sferics have local maximums and minimums, and appears to oscillate with distance. We utilize modeling of the Earth-ionosphere system to explain the results.",

Metropolitan Port-au-Prince and five cities in the North of Haiti including Cap-Haitien were included in this program.\nThe seismic microzonation is an important tool for the knowledge of the seismic risk. It is based on the collection of geological, geophysical and geotechnical data. It describes a specific class of soil associated with each type of soil. Its goal is to map the homogenous zones of soil to effects of site lithology, topographic site effects, liquefaction and ground movements.\nThis work is based on two aspects of the studies of microzoning for the city of Cap-Haïtien: effects of lithological site and Liquefaction.\nThe zoning of site effects is to identify and map the areas with consistent geological and geomechanical characteristics and homogeneous seismic response; the objective is to provide, in each zone, seismic movements adapted.\nFive classes of soil at site effects were distinguished. Associated responses spectra were obtained by a 1D nonlinear analysis using CyberQuake software (Modaressi et al. 1997 BRGM).\nThe zoning of the liquefaction present the liquefaction potential of different areas. Three levels of risk of liquefaction were found during this study that a large part of the city is strongly liquefiable.",

            "abstract": "SOHO/CELIAS/STOF measures suprathermal ions which are preferentially accelerated and end up as energetic particles. We have investigated temporal variations of He+ which has its origin in interstellar and inner-source pickup ions but could also - occasionally - be solar. We found no interstellar pickup He+ during solar quiet times in the energy-per-charge range from 35 to 660 keV/e. This gives an upper limit to the efficiency of the Gloeckler-Fisk v-5 mechanism. Using a combination of SOHO/CELIAS/PM and ACE/MAG data we investigate the He+ abundances in Co-rotating Interaction Regions (CIRs) during the years 1997 to 2007. We find that suprathermal pickup He+ mainly appears inside the compressed and decelerated fast solar wind region of (CIRs) and persists within the leading parts of the fast wind. This is also found in CIRs which have no associated forward or reverse shocks, the majority of CIRs at 1 AU. This observation could be explained by an injection and acceleration process due to a statistical mechanism in the compressed solar wind such as the Gloeckler-Fisk v-5 mechanism. In addition, we find an increase in the He+/He++ ratio in December which we believe to be a signature of SOHO crossing the focusing cone of interstellar neutral He. This analysis is based on a re-evaluation and careful modeling of the substantial background which is present in SOHO/CELIAS/STOF. Using data from SOHO/COSTEP/EPHIN, SOHO/CELIAS/STOF, and SOHO/CELIAS/SEM, we show that UV is not suppressed efficiently by the collimator of STOF and triggers the Time-of-Flight unit by generating photoelectrons. The second and third triggers are then provided by penetrating energetic particles which hit STOF's silicon solid-state detectors.",

The instrumentation of HALO-SR is characterized and first measurement data from the Next-generation Aircraft Remote-Sensing for Validation Studies (NARVAL) campaigns in 2013 and 2014 are presented. The measured data are analyzed in the context of the retrieved microphysical and optical properties of clouds which were observed underneath the aircraft.\nDetailed angular sensitivities of the two optical actinic flux receivers were determined in the laboratory. The effects of deviations from the ideal response are investigated using radiative transfer calculations of atmospheric radiance distributions under various atmospheric conditions and different ground albedos. Corresponding correction factors are derived.\nExample photolysis frequencies are presented, which were sampled in the free troposphere and lower stratosphere over the Atlantic Ocean during the 2013/14 HALO NARVAL campaigns. Dependencies of photolysis frequencies on cloud cover, flight altitude and wavelength range of the photolysis process are investigated.\nCalculated actinic flux densities in the presence of clouds benefit from the measured spectral radiances. Retrieved cloud optical thicknesses and effective droplet radii are used as model input for the radiative transfer calculations. By comparison with the concurrent measurements of actinic flux densities the retrieval approach is validated.\nAcknowledgements: Funding by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft within the priority program HALO (BO 1580/4-1, WE 1900/21-1) is gratefully acknowledged.",

            "abstract": "While it is well recognized that the Maritime Continent (MC) plays a key role in controlling the weather and climate continuum of the entire the globe, since it occupies the upward branch of the Walker and Hadley circulations, the behaviors of many atmospheric, oceanic, and coupled phenomena over the MC are still unrevealed mysteries. For example, when the most dominant tropical intraseasonal mode known as the Madden-Julian Oscillation propagates over the MC, its signal often becomes unclear probably due to the interaction with local circulation related to the diurnal cycle and complicated topography with steep mountains surrounded by warm waters. However, their mechanism has no consensus yet. In addition, most climate models are still suffering from the large systematic errors of precipitation amount compared to the observations with overestimate/underestimate over the land/ocean. To mitigate these errors, a new field campaign called Year of the Maritime Continent or YMC is proposed. The campaign is expected to be taken place from April 2017 through October 2018, and several internationally coordinated intensive observations aiming at various research topics are planned during this one year half period.\nAnalyses of radiosonde sounding data as well as sea surface temperature data in the MC region show the geographical preference of their time-scale variations; intraseasonal variability is dominant over the eastern MC region, while various time-scale (a few days - intraseasonal) variations in addition to diurnal cycle are found in the western MC region. Thus, observation strategy should be made by considering these features.",

Although flux towers only measure the surrounding vicinity or spatial footprint of their placement ecosystem, the data recorded at these towers can be up-scaled to much greater levels through the use of comprehensive remote sensing data and advanced computer modeling. The purpose of this study was to develop ecological net ecosystem production (NEP) models capable of producing weekly cropland and grassland NEP maps of the U.S. Great Plains at 250 meter resolution for 2000 - 2008. Separate NEP regression tree models were developed for each land cover type (cropland and grassland) with 15 flux towers supporting the grassland model and 13 towers supporting the cropland model. The NEP regression tree models were established through training based on data from the supporting flux towers, remote sensing data, and other biogeophysical inputs. Map results of this study indicate, as anticipated, grassland ecosystems generally perform as net carbon (C) sinks, absorbing and storing C from the atmosphere, and conversely, croplands generally as net C sources (crop yields were not taken into account), releasing C, in the form of CO2, into the atmosphere. The models were evaluated by implementing a leave-one-out cross validation method, which withholds data form one particular year or site for testing a model developed with the remaining data. The cropland model validation analysis received an average Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) of 0.85 for the yearly validation and an average r = 0.73 for the site withholding. The grassland model validation analysis received an average r = 0.86 for the yearly validation and an average r = 0.83 for the site withholding.",

            "abstract": "As the complexity of the problems we seek to address with process-based models continues to increase, our approaches to improving confidence in our predictions must keep pace. Process-based, distributed models have been applied in headwater catchments to address many different objectives, all of which are linked by their reliance on the selection of a catchment-representative parameter set or sets. While these parameter sets are typically obtained through calibration to the streamflow hydrograph, it is widely acknowledged that there is often insufficient information in the hydrograph to effectively address parameter equifinality. Here, we suggest that optimal parameter sets can be obtained with an additional step in the calibration process that considers the spatial representation of internal catchment behavior (e.g. space-time distributions of evapotranspiration, water table depth, presence of overland flow, soil water). Modeled internal catchment behavior is an under-utilized but valuable source of information for separating plausible from unlikely model scenarios. We demonstrate how spatial patterns of hydrologic states and fluxes across annual, seasonal, and event time scales can improve the calibration process and reduce likely parameter sets. Our approach is applied to an extensively monitored headwater catchment in Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest in central Montana, simulated using the Distributed Hydrology-Soil-Vegetation Model. Consideration of spatial diagnostics in the calibration process has great potential to ensure a holistic representation of catchment dynamics as well as to increase confidence in conclusions from these types of modeling applications.",

            "abstract": "Southern Ocean (SO) sea ice plays a critical role in climate at global and regional scales. To advance our understanding of processes that drive and regulate sea ice there is a strong need to further extend sea ice records into the past covering a broad range of boundary conditions and time scales. We present the SO sea ice development since the last glacial using a new diatom-based transfer function (Esper and Gersonde 2014). We have enhanced a previous circumpolar reconstruction of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (Gersonde et al. 2005) by new estimates from the hitherto not well-explored Pacific sector. This corroborates earlier results that LGM winter sea ice was expanded by ca. 100% compared to present. Time-series documenting the past 30,000 yrs are available from 29 sites from the western Indian, the Atlantic and the Pacific sectors. In general, the records suggest a post-glacial sea ice retreat between 18,000–15,000 yrs followed by a slight expansion during the Antarctic Cold Reversal. Minimum sea ice extent was reached in the early Holocene. Around 8.000 yrs ago we observe a re-expansion of sea ice, primarily in the Ross and the Weddell/Scotia Sea sectors. This general pattern is also mirrored by sea ice proxy records (ssNa flux) obtained from Antarctic ice cores. However, the marine records show that the sea ice development is subject to spatial heterogeneity related to SO circulation systems and bottom topography, and to land/ocean distribution. This may lead to area-specific expansions and latitudinal gradients in sea ice concentration with implications on climate-relevant factors e.g. albedo, ocean/atmosphere exchange, moisture distribution, water mass generation and biological productivity. The obtained proxy data are compared with scenarios from Earth system modelling (e.g. Zhang et al., 2013) to verify the outcome of numerical modeling, to test the potential of models to bridge gaps in the proxy-based record (e.g. summer sea ice extent, areas lacking proxy-based sedimentary signals) and to elaborate and quantify physical processes that force and amplify SO sea ice at different climate conditions.",

            "abstract": "Many current coupled global climate models simulate open ocean deep convection in the Southern Ocean as a recurring event with time scales ranging from a few years to centennial (de Lavergne et al., 2014, Nat. Clim. Ch.). The only observation of such event, however, was the occurrence of the Weddell Polynya in the mid-1970s, an open water area of 350 000 km2 within the Antarctic sea ice in three consecutive winters. Both the wide range of modeled frequency of occurrence and the absence of deep convection in the Weddell Sea highlights the lack of understanding concerning the phenomenon. Nevertheless, simulations indicate that atmospheric and oceanic responses to the cessation of deep convection in the Southern Ocean include a strengthening of the low-level atmospheric circulation over the Southern Ocean (increasing SAM index) and a reduction in the export of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), potentially masking the regional effects of global warming (Latif et al., 2013, J. Clim.; Martin et al., 2014, Deep Sea Res. II). It is thus of great importance to enhance our understanding of Southern Ocean deep convection and clarify the associated time scales.\nIn two multi-millennial simulations with the Kiel Climate Model (KCM, ECHAM5 T31 atmosphere & NEMO-LIM2 ~2˚ ocean) we showed that the deep convection is driven by strong oceanic warming at mid-depth periodically overriding the stabilizing effects of precipitation and ice melt (Martin et al., 2013, Clim. Dyn.). Sea ice thickness also affects location and duration of the deep convection. A new control simulation, in which, amongst others, the atmosphere grid resolution is changed to T42 (~2.8˚), yields a faster deep convection flip-flop with a period of 80-100 years and a weaker but still significant global climate response similar to CMIP5 simulations. While model physics seem to affect the time scale and intensity of the phenomenon, the driving mechanism is a rather robust feature. Finally, we compare the atmospheric and oceanic responses among CMIP5 models. Since open ocean convection is the dominant mode of AABW formation in these models, the northward extent and strength of the AABW cell in the Atlantic correlates with the deep convection intensity but varies between models. Likewise, atmospheric response patterns outside the Southern Ocean region are not consistent among models.",

We have analyzed 50 QP events measured by the DEMETER satellite at altitudes of about 700 km to verify their generation mechanism.\nThe analyzed events have a modulation period between 15 s and 80 s, and they were observed during quiet geomagnetic conditions (Kp<3).\nMagnetometers of the CARISMA system were used for monitoring the ULF magnetic field pulsations in a wide spatial range. We have found that ULF magnetic field pulsations in the Pc3 - Pc5 range are well correlated with the occurrence of the QP emissions with modulation periods between about 40 and 80 s. At the same time, increased fluxes of high-energy electrons (E > 30 keV) were observed by DEMETER and by the NOAA-17 satellite. We analyze possible links between these electrons, QP emissions, and ULF magnetic field pulsations.",

            "abstract": "The Alto Tiberina Fault (ATF) is a 60 km long east-dipping low-angle normal fault, located in a sector of the Northern Apennines (Italy) undergoing active extension since the Quaternary. The ATF has been imaged by analyzing the active source seismic reflection profiles, and the instrumentally recorded persistent background seismicity. The present study is an attempt to separate the contributions of source, site, and crustal attenuation, in order to focus on the mechanics of the seismic sources on the ATF, as well on the synthetic and the antithetic structures within the ATF hanging-wall (i.e. Colfiorito fault, Gubbio fault and Umbria Valley fault).\nIn order to compute source spectra, we perform a set of regressions over the seismograms of 2000 small earthquakes (-0.8 < ML< 4) recorded between 2010 and 2014 at 50 permanent seismic stations deployed in the framework of the Alto Tiberina Near Fault Observatory project (TABOO) and equipped with three-components seismometers, three of which located in shallow boreholes. Because we deal with some very small earthquakes, we maximize the signal to noise ratio (SNR) with a technique based on the analysis of peak values of bandpass-filtered time histories, in addition to the same processing performed on Fourier amplitudes. We rely on a tool called Random Vibration Theory (RVT) to completely switch from peak values in the time domain to Fourier spectral amplitudes.\nLow-frequency spectral plateau of the source terms are used to compute moment magnitudes (Mw) of all the events, whereas a source spectral ratio technique is used to estimate the corner frequencies (Brune spectral model) of a subset of events chosen over the analysis of the noise affecting the spectral ratios. So far, the described approach provides high accuracy over the spectral parameters of earthquakes of localized seismicity, and may be used to gain insights into the underlying mechanics of faulting and the earthquake processes.",

            "abstract": "The primary responsibility of the Hydrographic Department at the Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO) is to support US Navy surface and sub-surface Safety of Navigation (SoN) requirements. These requirements are interpreted, surveys are conducted, and accurate products are compiled and archived for future exploitation. For a number of years NAVOCEANO has employed a two-tiered data-basing structure to support SoN. The first tier (Data Warehouse, or DWH) provides access to the full-resolution sonar and lidar data. DWH preserves the original data such that any scale product can be built. The second tier (Digital Bathymetric Database – Variable resolution, or DBDB-V) served as the final archive for SoN chart scale, gridded products compiled from source bathymetry. DBDB-V has been incorporated into numerous DoD tactical decision aids and serves as the foundation bathymetry for ocean modeling. With the evolution of higher density survey systems and the addition of high-resolution gridded bathymetry product requirements, a two-tiered model did not provide an efficient solution for SoN. The two-tiered approach required scientists to exploit full-resolution data in order to build any higher resolution product. A new perspective on the archival and exploitation of source data was required. This new perspective has taken the form of a third tier, the Navigation Surface Database (NSDB). NSDB is an SQLite relational database populated with International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), S-102 compliant Bathymetric Attributed Grids (BAGs). BAGs archived within NSDB are developed at the highest resolution that the collection sensor system can support and contain nodal estimates for depth, uncertainty, separation values and metadata. Gridded surface analysis efforts culminate in the generation of the source resolution BAG files and their storage within NSDB. Exploitation of these resources eliminates the time and effort needed to re-grid and re-analyze native source file formats.",

            "abstract": "Phenological events in temperate deciduous forests, such as bud burst and senescence, exert strong control over seasonal fluxes of water, energy and carbon. The timing of these transitions is influenced primarily by air temperature, which makes them robust indicators of biological responses to climate change. However, the exact nature and magnitude of these controls is currently poorly understood. In this paper, we used a combination of surface meteorological data, species composition maps, remote sensing, and ground-based observations, including camera-based time series of canopy greenness from PhenoCams and citizen science data from the USA-National Phenology Network, to develop and test models that predict the timing of spring leaf emergence across several different deciduous broadleaf forest types in the eastern contiguous United States (68°W-95°W, 30°N-50°N). As part of this analysis, we analyzed two existing land surface model phenology subroutines and specifically examined predictions for two years with anomalously warm temperatures during dormancy to investigate the role of chilling. The results indicate significant differences in cumulative heating requirements and photoperiod cues among forest types. Moreover, we found that regional patterns of species composition explain spatial variation in prediction errors from existing models. In addition, we identified a marginal, but statistically significant decrease in model bias when chilling requirements were included during an anomalously warm winter with average spring temperatures, but no significant improvement when both winter and springtime temperatures were more representative of future climate.",

            "abstract": "India is a hotspot for food security issues over the upcoming decades, due to increasing population pressures, groundwater depletion, and climate change. Investing in additional irrigation infrastructure may bolster food security, however, the relative influence of different types of irrigation (e.g. groundwater versus canal) on agricultural production remains unclear. One reason that the relative impact of different irrigation strategies on agricultural production has not been analyzed across India is because national-scale data on crop production and the types of irrigation technologies used are typically available at too coarse of spatial and temporal resolutions to answer this question adequately. Thus, we develop a novel algorithm to map cropped area across India at a 1 x 1 km scale using MODIS satellite data, and link these high-resolution cropped area maps with village-level data (n = 600,000) on irrigation. This allowed us to assess the relative impact of groundwater (i.e. dug, shallow, and deep wells) and canal irrigation (i.e. surface lift and flow canals) on winter cropped area and its sensitivity to rainfall across India at the village-scale from 2000 to 2006. We find that deep well irrigation is both associated with the greatest amount of winter cropped area, and is also the least sensitive to monsoon and winter rainfall variability. However, the effectiveness of deep well irrigation varies across India, with the greatest benefits seen in the regions that are most at risk for losing groundwater as a possible source of irrigation over the upcoming decades (e.g. Northwest India). This work highlights the need to develop ways to use remaining groundwater more efficiently (e.g. drip irrigation, less water-intensive crops) given that canal irrigation is not an adequate substitute, particularly in the regions that are facing the greatest levels of groundwater depletion.",

            "abstract": "Approximately 10% of the OC lost from soils as a result of land use has been argued to be delivered to the ocean (Lal 2003). The fate of this OC is highly dependent on the organic geochemical composition of the soil pool and the nature of the marine environment that receives it. The conversion of bush to pastureland via burning in the Waipaoa and Waiapu watersheds increased erosion rates by an order of magnitude. Surface and bank erosion, coupled with landsliding and gullying deliver OC to the rivers. Visual observations, sediment budgets, C-isotope (12C, 13C, 14C) mass balances and biomarker analyses all indicate that the OC is a mixture of recent plant debris, charcoal, aged soil C (< 18 kyrs old) and Cretaceous – Neogene sedimentary rock-derived C. The vastly different ages of the OC pools might be expected to lead to different reactivities and fates in the seabed.\nNearshore wave-driven deposition-resuspension cycles winnow fines from sands in water depths ~<50 m. The sand-sized sedimentary OC is dominated by rock C. Younger fractions of soil C are transported primarily as fines to deeper water. Marine OC is added to the fine-grained sediments as they encounter zones of primary production.\nDissolved inorganic C (DIC) within the interstitial (pore) waters of the marine sediments is a mixture of seawater DIC and benthic respired C. The C-isotopic composition of the DIC reflects its source. Stable isotope and radiocarbon measurements indicate that contemporary terrestrial C3 plant OC oxidation dominates respiration on the Waiapu shelf nearshore (~60 m). Marine OC is preferentially oxidized at water depths >80 m. The rock-derived C does not seem to be oxidized on the shelf or upper slope.\nA comparison of riverine particulate organic C (POC) with shelf depocenter OC concentrations suggest the Waipaoa and Waiapu soil C burial efficiencies are ~50 and 85% respectively. This does not consider the fate of soil C dispersed beyond the depocenter where preservation efficiencies are expected to be lower because of greater exposure times to O2 at the sediment-water interface. Nevertheless, these small rivers are more efficient at the sequestration of soil C than some tropical counterparts (e.g. Amazon and Fly) in which extensive oxidation of the terrestrial OC has been documented.",

Luminescence and radiocarbon ages for periods of dune accumulation and stability are compared with palaeoenvironment proxies to provide an assessment of the boundary conditions of dune system response to changes in sediment supply, availability, and mobility. Dune fields in the northern Great Plains were formed from sediment originating from glaciofluvial or glaciolacustrine sediments deposited during deglaciation 16-11 ka. Subsequent aeolian deposition occurred in Parkland and Prairie dune fields as a result of mid-Holocene (8-5 ka) and late-Holocene (< 3.5 ka) activity related to drought conditions that reworked pre-existing aeolian sands. In the Central Great Plains, dune fields are closely linked to fluvial sediment sources. Sediment supply was high during deglaciation of the Rocky Mountains and resulted in widespread dune construction 16-10 ka. Multiple periods of Holocene reactivation are recorded and reflect increased sediment availability during drought episodes. Dune fields in the southwestern deserts experienced periods of construction as a result of enhanced supply of sediment from fluvial and lacustrine sources during the period 11.8-8 ka and at multiple intervals during the late Holocene. Despite spatial and temporal gaps in chronometric data as a result of sampling biases, the record from North American dune fields indicates the strong influence of sediment supply on dune construction, with changes in sediment availability as a result of drought episodes resulting in dune field reactivation and reworking of pre-existing sediment.",

Planning for the effects of SLR requires understanding the coupled response of SLR, geomorphic and hydrodynamic processes; this will provide crucial information for managers to make informed decisions for human and natural communities. Evaluating changes in tidal hydrodynamics under future scenarios is a key aspect for understanding the effects of SLR on coastal systems; tidal hydrodynamics influence inundation, circulation patterns, sediment transport processes, shoreline erosion, and productivity of marshes and other species.\nThis study evaluates the dynamic effects of SLR and morphologic change on tidal hydrodynamics along the Northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOM) coast from Mississippi to the Florida panhandle. A large-scale hydrodynamic model is used to simulate astronomic tides under present (circa 2005), and future conditions (circa 2050 and 2100). The model is modified with specific SLR scenarios, morphology, and shorelines that represent the conditions at each of the time periods. Future sea levels for the years 2050 and 2100 are determined using the Parris et al. (2012) projections. To make projections of future morphology, a Bayesian Network (BN) is implemented. The BN is used to define relationships between forcing mechanisms and coastal responses based on long-term relative SLR, mean wave height, long-term shoreline change rates, mean tidal range, geomorphic setting and coastal slope. Probabilistic predictions of future shoreline positions and dune heights are developed for each SLR scenario for the years 2050 and 2100. The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is then updated to reflect the future morphologic changes.\nComparison of present and future conditions illustrates the hydrodynamic response of the system to the changing landscape. Changes in variables such as harmonic tidal constituents, tidal range, tidal prism, tidal datums, circulation patterns and inundation areas are examined. This provides a better understanding of the physical processes of the current state of the NGOM and gives insight into how future SLR and coastal landscape changes may affect hydrodynamics within the NGOM estuary systems.",

In many cases these are single-image time series where the processing limitation lies in the paucity of methods to obtain 3-dimension object space information from measurements in the 2-dimensional image space; in other cases camera pairs have been operated but no automated means is in hand for conventional stereometric analysis of many thousands of image pairs. Often the processing task is further complicated by weak camera geometry or ground control distribution, either of which will compromise the quality of 3-dimensional object space solutions. Solutions exist for many of these problems, found sometimes among the latest computer vision results, and sometimes buried in decades-old pre-digital terrestrial photogrammetric literature. Other problems, particularly those arising from poorly constrained or underdetermined camera and ground control geometry, may be unsolvable. Small-scale, ground-based photography and photogrammetry of glaciers has grown over the past few decades in an organic and disorganized fashion, with much duplication of effort and little coordination or sharing of knowledge among researchers. Given the utility of terrestrial photogrammetry, its low cost (if properly developed and implemented), and the substantial value of the information to be had from it, some further effort to share knowledge and methods would be a great benefit for the community. We consider some of the main problems to be solved, and aspects of how optimal knowledge sharing might be accomplished.",

            "abstract": "Carbonatites are carbonate-rich and very fluid melts believed to form mainly from primary mantle melting. The mobility of these melts has attracted renewed interest as carbonatites are considered a major transport agent of carbon from the mantle to the crust and may be intimately linked to the generation of kimberlites.\nThe measurement of carbonatite viscosity is a priority in order to understand the carbonatite mobility and reaction rates. Obtaining accurate viscosity measurements of such low viscosity melts is however an experimental challenge due to volatility, very low torques and melt stability in the viscometer.\nWe present preliminary results of a rheological characterization study (Couette viscometry) on a series of very low viscosity natural melts and their analogues. Experiments have been performed using a Modular Compact Rheometer (Anton Paar MCR 502) equipped with 2 custom-made concentric-cylinder narrow gap geometries (steel and Pt-Au). The rheometer is characterized by an air-bearing-supported synchronous motor with torque ranging between 0.01 µNm and 230 mNm (resolution of 0.1 nNm).\nThe instrument has been calibrated in a temperature-viscosity-shear rate window comparable with carbonate melts. Initially, a certified silicone standard (980 and 39000 mPa sec in a temperature interval 100-25°C) at shear rate of 1 to 100 sec-1 has been used. Then the viscosity of distilled water (0.08 – 0.05 mPa sec) at 30 and 60°C has been measured between 30 and 70 sec-1. Finally, high temperature calibration measurements at 1000°C have been performed using a DGG standard glass.\nViscosity measurements on carbonate melts have been performed in the temperature range of 730-950°C. Measured values range between 3.4 and 15.2 mPa sec. Results show that in the investigated temperature range the melts exhibit, as expected, Newtonian viscosity. The results will be discussed in the context of all available data from the literature including high pressure determinations.",

This river system is the first in term of sediment transport and thus constitute an interesting region to establish a relation between erosion and climate. Sediments from the Bay of Bengal indicate that the strength of summer monsoon rainfall is an important factor driving weathering and erosion of the Himalaya.\nResults of a high-resolution clay mineralogy study combined with major elements geochemistry and oxygen isotopes stratigraphy are reported for a deep-sea piston core collected 300 km off the Ganges-Brahmaputra Rivers estuary in the northern part of the Bay in Bengal. In this study, the top part (first 13.5 m) of Core MD12-3412 covers the last climatic cycle (last 180 kyr). This core reveals a monsoon-controlled chemical weathering and physical erosion history during the last 180 kyr in the Himalayan range and the Ganges-Brahmaputra Basin.\nData show the contribution of Ganges-Brahmaputra Rivers, which drain the Himalayan range and the Indo-Gangetic plain. Clay mineral assemblages are dominated by illite and smectite, with lesser abundance of chlorite and kaolinite. Smectite/(illite + chlorite) and illite chemistry index are used as indices of chemical weathering rates. Thirty five new samples for εNd(0) analyses were selected (in turbidite and hemipelagic layers) during glacial and interglacial periods.\n Himalayan range is characterized by εNd(0) ≈ -16, whereas εNd(0) values along the Arakan coast are around -8. In this work we compared with εNd(0) values obtained previously on the free-carbonated fraction on Core MD77-180 which show that sediment from the eastern Bay of Bengal results from the mixing of material from the Himalayan and Indo–Burman ranges (with an average value of εNd(0) ≈ -13 for the last climatic cycle). These analyses give us information about the material coming from Ganges-Brahmaputra Rivers system and Indo-Burman ranges and, in turn, on the Indian summer monsoon intensity.",

Models describing the interactions of competing processes at a range of spatial and time scales are critical for connecting the advanced capabilities for materials characterization at the atomic scale with the macroscopic behavior of the complex Earth system. The Biosphere 2 Landscape Evolution Observatory (LEO) consists of three large-scale landscapes constructed inside an environmentally controlled greenhouse facility, and its goal is to develop an understanding of how climate, rock and biota interact over time to influence hillslope structure formation and its feedback to the movement of water through the landscape. Here we use a coupled model, CATHY (a 3-dimensional, variably-saturated, coupled surface-subsurface flow code) and CrunchFlow (a multicomponent reactive flow and transport code cabable of simulating changes in the physical structure of the hillslope as a result of incongruent weathering processes) as a tool to further our understanding of the governing processes and interactions in the controlled LEO and natural hillslope systems. This model provides an ability to further examine the interactions and feedbacks between geochemical systems and complex subsurface flow fields. We will present the modelling method and some results of mineral weathering and neo-phase precipitation during the first experiment at LEO.",

The multidisciplinary project INFLUINS (Integrated FLUid dynamics IN Sedimentary basins) aims for investigating the behavior of fluids in the Thuringian Basin, a small intra-continental sedimentary basin in Germany, at different spatial scales, ranging from the pore scale to the extent of the entire basin.\nAs hydraulic properties often significantly vary with spatial scales, e.g. seismic data using different frequencies are required to gain information about the spatial variability of elastic and hydraulic subsurface properties. For the Thuringian Basin, we use seismic and borehole data acquired in the framework of INFLUINS.\nBasin-wide structural imaging data are available from 2D reflection seismic profiles as well as 2.5D and 3D seismic travel time tomography. Further, core material from a 1,179 m deep drill hole completed in 2013 is available for laboratory seismic experiments on mm- to cm-scale. The data are complemented with logging data along the entire drill hole. This campaign yielded e.g. sonic and density logs allowing the estimation of in-situ P-velocity and acoustic impedance with a spatial resolution on the cm-scale and provides improved information about petrologic and stratigraphic variability at different scales.\nJoint interpretation of basin scale structural and elastic properties data with laboratory scale data from ultrasound experiments using core samples enables a detailed and realistic imaging of the subsurface properties on different spatial scales. Combining seismic travel time tomography with stratigraphic interpretation provides useful information of variations in the elastic properties for certain geological units and therefore gives indications for changes in hydraulic properties.",

            "abstract": "Seafloor gas vents within the hydrate stability zone along continental margins are frequently associated with high saturations of gas hydrate that increase upwards towards the seafloor (e.g. NGHP 01 Site 10A, UBGH2 Site 3, ODP Site 1249A). One model for how gas migrates through the hydrate stability zone proposes that salt exclusion during hydrate formation elevates the in-situ salinity, which allows for the coexistence of gas, hydrate, and water. In some portions of these sites, however, the hydrate saturations derived from pressure cores are insufficient to elevate the bulk salinity enough to induce three-phase conditions. Commonly, hydrate in these zones exists in individual, high-angle fractures within mudstone. An alternative gas migration model, applicable to fractured regions, proposes that the fractures act as highly permeable gas conduits for upward fluid flow. We present a model to describe gas flow and hydrate formation in these fractures. Hydrate begins forming at the fracture wall, where the components (water and gas) are available. Water is continuously drawn from the mudstone to the fracture by capillary forces. Due to hydrate formation, salinity is elevated to three-phase conditions at the fracture wall. Simultaneously, salt diffuses away from the fracture into the bounding mudstone. At this point, hydrate formation is controlled by the chemical diffusion of salt away from and the advection of less-saline water towards the fracture wall. Hydrate formation is ultimately limited by either insufficient water flow to the hydrate front or elevation of the bulk salinity to three-phase conditions. We explore the timescale, nature, and limitation of hydrate formation in vertical fractures.",

            "abstract": "Global variations in mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) composition, the most abundant magma type on the planet, variously correlate with ridge depth. This has been attributed to either variations in mantle temperature, resulting in varying crustal thickness and thermal buoyancy, or to varying mantle composition and density. MORB compositional variations over ocean rises, large regional highs in ridge depth, however, are not uniform, and require more than one primary variable to explain them. A key consideration is that while mantle residue is continuously removed from the melting column as it narrows upward, due to focusing, melt is conserved, progressively interacting with the mantle to the base of the lithosphere where it begins to segregate. This is consistent with field observations that most dunites representing melt segregation and transport are late-crosscutting features in abyssal and ophiolitic mantle sections. We use pMELTS, a thermodynamic modeling program, to illustrate the relative effects of source composition and potential temperature on MORB during focused melting and show that both mantle temperature and composition variations can explain global MORB geochemistry. Thus estimates of lateral temperature variations in the upper mantle that ignore the effects of source composition represent only a maximum – and likely lead to an overestimate.",

            "abstract": "Antarctic ice shelves represent a critical interface between continental ice masses and the surrounding ocean. Breakup events of several ice shelves in recent decades have been linked to an increase in intense surface melting, and have in turn lead to cascading effects including accelerated glacier discharge into the ocean. In this study, we utilized sophisticated regional and global climate models (GCMs) to assess potential future surface melt trajectories across Antarctica under two climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). RACMO2.1, a polar-adapted regional atmospheric climate model, was forced by the ERA-Interim reanalysis (1980-2010) and by two GCMs, EC-EARTH and HadGEM2-ES (2007-2100). Using RACMO2.1, we observed an exponential growth function well represents the relationship between ice shelf surface meltwater production and mean summer (DJF) 2-meter air temperature (t2m). We employed this melt-t2m relationship to project melt using t2m output from an ensemble of five CMIP5-based GCMs incorporating the NCAR Community Land Model 4 (CLM4), following spatial downscaling and bias correction using t2m from ERA-Interim-forced RACMO2.1. Our resulting GCM-derived melt projections provide an independent and methodologically unique perspective into potential future melt pathways, complementary to those derived from RACMO2.1. Most notably, both RACMO2.1 and the CMIP5 ensemble reveal divergent trajectories of meltwater production beyond 2050 under the two climate scenarios. For many ice shelves in RCP4.5, meltwater production through 2100 remains at levels comparable to present. Conversely, under RCP8.5 all methods indicate non-linear melt intensification, resulting in a four-fold increase in the Antarctic-wide meltwater volume by the end of the 21st century. For some ice shelves, including Larsen C and Wilkins (Antarctic Peninsula), and Shackleton and West (Wilkes Land), spatially averaged end-of-century meltwater production within RCP8.5 approaches or surpasses levels historically associated with collapse of Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves (~600 mm w.e. a-1). While many factors influence ice shelf stability, these projections indicate a strong sensitivity of ice shelf melting to future climate pathways with potentially profound effects on future ice shelf stability.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the potential of rotary wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to monitor the surf zone. In recent years, the arrival of lightweight, high-capacity batteries, low-power electronics and compact high-definition cameras has driven the development of commercially available UAVs for hobbyists. Moreover, the low operation costs have increased their potential for scientific research as these UAVs are extremely flexible surveying platforms. The UAVs can fly for ~12 min with a mean loiter radius of 1 - 3.5 m and a mean loiter error of 0.75 - 4.5 m, depending on the environmental conditions, flying style, battery type and vehicle type. Our experiments using multiple, alternating UAVs show that it is possible to have near continuous imagery data with similar Fields Of View.\nThe images obtained from the UAVs (Fig. 1a), and in combination with surveyed Ground Control Points (GCPs) (Fig. 1b, red squares and white circles), can be geo-rectified (Fig. 1c) to pixel resolution between 0.01 - 1 m and a reprojection error, i.e. the difference between the surveyed GPS location of a GCP and the location of the GCP obtained from the geo-rectified image, of O(1 m). These geo-rectified images provide data on a variety of coastal aspects, such as beach width (Wb(x,t)), surf zone width (Wsf(x,t)), wave breaking location (rectangle B), beach usage (circle C) and location of dune vegegation (rectangle D), amongst others.\nAdditionally, the possibility to have consecutive, high frequency (up to 2 Hz) rectified images makes the UAVs a great data instrument for spatially and temporally variable systems, such as the surf zone. Our first observations with the UAVs reveal the potential to quickly obtain surf zone and beach characteristics in response to storms or for day to day beach information, as well as the scientific pursuits of surf zone kinematics on different spatial and temporal scales, and dispersion and advection estimates of pollutants/dye.\nA selection of findings from several field experiments and using multiple optical instruments will be showed at the meeting, discussing the new possibilities rotary wing UAVs can offer for surf zone research.",

            "abstract": "A 16-day field experiment was conducted in March and April 2013 in a tidal wetland in Kent County, Delaware. The study area was a tidal flat fed by a second-order channel that flows into the Brockonbridge Gut, a small tributary of Delaware Bay. The goal of the field study was to investigate spatio-temporal variability in the hydrodynamics of the tidal flat and the small channels that intersect it, over the period of one spring-neap tidal cycle. The experiment combined remotely-sensed imagery with high-frequency in-situ measurements. A tower with imagers (RGB, NIR, TIR) was deployed to quantify the spatial variations of inundation of the channels, flat and marsh. In-situ sensors that measure flow velocity, sediment concentration and water depth were deployed at six locations on the tidal flat and in the channels. At three locations, a Nortek Vectrino II – profiling velocimeter was deployed that measures a 30 mm velocity profile at 1 mm vertical increments at 100 Hz. These velocity profiles are used to compute turbulent kinetic energy, turbulence dissipation and stress profiles close to the bed. Results show that peak velocities in the channels occur at the beginning and end of ebbing tide, when the water level is below the tidal flat level. At these instances, peaks in turbulence and bed stress also occur. The flow velocity and turbulence peaks are smaller when the water level does not fall below the tidal flat level. On the tidal flat, the flow velocities and turbulence are generally small compared to the intersecting tidal channel. Maximum flow velocities in the channels are around 0.4 m/s, while on the flat maximum velocities are under 0.1 m/s. A comparison is made between turbulence production and dissipation in both the channel and on the tidal flat to determine if advection and diffusion are important in this environment. In addition, the hydrodynamics at several locations in the channel are compared to investigate changes throughout the study area.",

            "abstract": "Although urban areas contribute between 67-75% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, there is very little understanding of what drives anthropogenic emissions both locally and globally. Part of this gap in knowledge is due to a lack of reliable measurements across a range of urban scales. Where, when, and how much urban areas use energy is also a function of human activity patterns and social practices deeply embedded in culture. One apparent manifestation of energy use patterns in human settlements is in the celebration of holidays – when human activity patterns change, this affects short-term patterns in energy consumption. Using satellite-based retrievals of nighttime lighting (NTL) during three major holiday periods, (1) Christmas and New Year’s, (2) the Holy Month of Ramadan, and (3) the Chinese Spring Festival, we demonstrate that cultural variations within and between urban areas contextualize and shape the magnitude and timing of energy use. We derived NTL signatures from the Suomi-NPP satellite's (VIIRS) Day/Night Band for two years and over 1200 cities. The high-quality NTL retrievals are based on the latest science reprocessing (Collection V1.1, c. 8/2014) produced by the Land Product Evaluation and Analysis Tool Element (Land PEATE) at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. After correcting for cloud and snow cover, as well as atmospheric-, terrain-, lunar BRDF-, fire-, and straylight effects, the high-resolution NTL time series were decomposed into seasonal, trend, and remainder signals—revealing strong, consistent patterns of activity changes during holiday periods. We demonstrate that patterns of holiday luminosity reveal changes in human activities important for understanding urban demographics and urban dynamics, and are strong examples of the socio-cultural and energy demand signatures embedded in satellite remote sensing imagery.",

            "abstract": "The Mozambique Channel (MC) is one of the major source areas feeding into the Agulhas Current, thereby presenting a major upstream control on Agulhas leakage. A large proportion of the hydrographic and transport variability observed in the MC can be attributed to the passing of large anticyclonic eddies, resulting in temporal deepening of the thermocline. A long-term mooring and sediment trap array in the MC is used to couple in situ physio-chemical conditions with planktonic foraminiferal test calcite chemistry to develop a novel proxy for past eddy intensity. Sediment trap samples from the Mozambique Channel, representing either persisting eddy or non-eddy conditions, were compared in order to investigate a possible impact of eddies on foraminiferal test chemistry. To test whether the calcite chemistry of different species can be used to reconstruct water column stratification, single chamber Mg/Ca was determined using laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Ablated specimens of the surface-dweller Globigerinoides ruber and the thermocline-dwelling species Neogloboquadrina dutertrei and Pulleniatina obliquiloculata, as well as the deep-dwelling Globorotalia scitula were subsequently used to determine single specimen-stable oxygen isotope ratios. Results show that reduced temperature stratification during eddy conditions can be recognized from the difference in Mg/Ca between N. dutertrei and G. scitula. The close correspondence between inter-species offsets in Mg/Ca-based calcification temperature, between thermocline and sub-thermocline foraminiferal species, provides a promising proxy for reconstructing eddy frequency.",

            "abstract": "The objective of this work is to calibrate channel depth and roughness parameters of the LISFLOOD-FP Sub-Grid 2D hydraulic model using SAR image-derived flood extent maps. The aim is to reduce uncertainty in flood model predictions for those rivers where channel geometry is unknown and/or cannot be easily measured. In particular we consider the effectiveness of using real SAR data for calibration and whether the number and timings of SAR acquisitions is of benefit to the final result. Terrain data are processed from 2m LiDAR images and inflows to the model are taken from gauged data.\nAs a test case we applied the method to the River Severn between Worcester and Tewkesbury. We firstly applied the automatic flood mapping algorithm of Giustarini[1] et al. (2013) to ENVISAT ASAR (wide swath mode) flood images; generating a series of flood maps. We then created an ensemble of flood extent maps with the hydraulic model (each model representing a unique parameter set). Where there is a favourable comparison between the modelled flood map and the SAR obtained flood map we may suggest an optimal parameter set. Applying the method to a sequence of SAR acquisitions provides insight into the advantages, disadvantages and limitations of using series of acquired images. To complete the investigation we simultaneously explore parameter ‘identifiabilty’ within a sequence of available satellite observations by adopting the DYNIA method proposed by Wagener[2] et al. (2003). We show where we might most easily detect the depth and roughness parameters within the SAR acquisition sequence.\n\n[1] Giustarini. 2013. ‘A Change Detection Approach to Flood Mapping in Urban Areas Using TerraSAR-X’.

            "abstract": "Over the past 30 years, the Laurentian Great Lakes have exhibited summertime warming trends in surface water temperature which were greater than those in surface air temperature of the surrounding land, by as much as an order of magnitude over some of the regions. For the years 1995–2012, Lake Superior exhibited the most dramatic warming trend in July-mean temperature, of 0.27±0.15 deg. C yr–1, based on the NOAA’s GLSEA satellite observations. Shallower lakes, such as Lake Erie, exhibited smaller warming trends. In addition, within each lake, the warming was also the greatest in the regions of larger water depth; for example, some regions of Lake Superior deeper than 200m exhibited surface-water July-mean warming trends which exceeded 0.3 deg. C yr–1. We used a three-column lake model based on the one developed by Hostetler and Barnstein (1990) coupled with a two-layer atmospheric energy balance model to explore the physics behind these warming trends. We found that, as suggested by Austin and Colman (2007), the ice–albedo feedback plays an important role in amplifying the overlake warming trends. Our particular emphasis was on the question of whether the ice-albedo feedback alone is enough to account for lacustrine amplification of surface warming observed over the Great Lakes region. We found that the answer to this question depends on a number of model parameters, including the diffusion and light attenuation coefficients, which greatly affect the model’s skill in reproducing the observed ice coverage of the deep lakes.",

We adopt principles from landscape ecology and urban planning to evaluate urban heterogeneity and design themes that may constitute more sustainable urban forms, including compactness (connectivity), density, mixed land uses, diversity, and greening. Using 2-D wavelet and multi-resolution analysis, landscape metrics, and satellite-derived indices of vegetation fraction and impervious surface, the spatial variability of Landsat and MODIS data from metropolitan areas of Manaus and São Paulo, Brazil are investigated. Landscape metrics for density, connectivity, and diversity, like the Shannon Diversity Index, are used to assess the diversity of urban buildings, geographic extent, and connectedness. Rapid detection of urban classes for low density, medium density, high density, and tall building district at the 1-km scale are needed for use in climate models. If the complexity of finer-scale urban characteristics can be related to the neighborhood scale both climate and sustainability assessments may be more attainable across urban areas.",

            "abstract": "The consistency of the calibration of instruments in orbit is essential to accurately determine any trends in the reflected short-wave (SW) radiation and in physical parameters retrieved using radiances. The 14-year record of measurements from the CERES, MISR and MODIS instruments onboard NASA’s Terra satellite allows us to evaluate the long-term relative stability of the radiances measured by these instruments. To examine the relative stability of the instruments’ calibration we use the CERES Single Scanner Footprint – MISR (SSFM) dataset. This dataset collocates radiances from CERES (Edition 3A), MISR (version F03_0024) and MODIS (Collections 4 and 5) and averages the narrowband radiances from the four MISR bands (446, 557, 672 and 868 nm) and two of the MODIS bands (650 and 858 nm) over the broadband CERES footprint. This provides us with a dataset of radiances matched in time, space and viewing geometry which we have extended to cover the 14 years of CERES Ed3A data currently available.\nTo evaluate the relative stability of the radiances we use a regression-based approach to calculate the bias between the different radiances relative to a reference year. The change in this bias over the record allows us to determine how the radiances from the different instruments are drifting relative to one another. Over all-sky ocean scenes, we find that the relative drift between the MISR narrowbands and CERES SW broadband radiance is within 1% per decade. The trend is larger when comparing the 866 nm (0.9±0.2% per decade), 672 nm (0.9±0.1%), and 557 nm (0.7±0.4%) bands than when comparing the 446 nm (0.0±0.2%) band. The MODIS 650 nm and 858 nm bands show drifts relative to CERES of 2.1±0.5% and 1.1±0.8% per decade. However, a portion of those trends appears to be related to a step-change of approximately 1.5% between 2008 and 2009. MODIS and MISR have a relative trend of 1.1±0.7% per decade between the 650 nm and 672 nm bands and no trend between the 858 nm and 868 nm bands. Overall, the relative stability between the different instruments is good, largely within the range of ±1.0% per decade, and all within the range ±2.1% per decade. These results lend support to the validity of time-series of radiation and physical parameters derived from these instruments.",

Given its relatively low viscosity, it may flow during and after production and result in time-dependent surface deformation. To predict the consequences of alternative production strategies, we seek to understand the primary controls on stress-driven flow and surface deformation of hydrocarbon extraction from a reservoir topped by rocksalt. The mechanical properties of rock salt are a key influence, but complicated. Depending on grain size, temperature, and stress, salt can deform mainly elastically, by power law viscous creep, and/or by linear viscous diffusion creep. In this study, we evaluate the evolution of production induced deformation using generic geo-mechanical models. Our strategy is to start with simplified geometries, rheologies, and forcing, and to increase model complexity slowly. Our results show that there are two distinctly different time scales that dominate the evolution of the models: short term subsidence and longer term partial rebound. The shortest time scale corresponds to stress-driven flow in the vicinity of the reservoir. The longest time scale is controlled by resistance to viscous flow and stress relaxation within a wider region of the rocksalt layer. We discuss the sensitivity to the thickness of the rocksalt seal, the geometry of the reservoir, and the distance between the source and the seal.",

While these traditional catalog systems are often robust, very little has been done in the way of meta data mining to aid in the search and discovery process. The recently coined term “Big Data” can be applied in the remote sensing world’s efforts to derive information from the vast data holdings of satellite based land remote sensing data. Large catalog-based search and discovery systems such as the United States Geological Survey's Earth Explorer system and the NASA Earth Observing System Data and Information System's Reverb-ECHO system provide comprehensive access to these data holdings, but do little to expose the underlying scene-based meta data. These catalog-based systems are extremely flexible, but are manually intensive and often require a high level of user expertise. Exposing scene-based meta data to external, web-based services can enable machine-driven queries to aid in the search and discovery process. Furthermore, services which expose additional scene-based content data (such as product quality information) are now available and can provide a “deeper look” into remote sensing data archives too large for efficient manual search methods.\nThis presentation shows examples of the mining of Landsat and Aster scene-based meta data, and an experimental service using OPeNDAP to extract information from quality band from multiple granules in the MODIS archive.",

The physiographic and geomorphological characteristics of channels, as well as flow conditions, exert no influence on simulated upland dynamics. In this work we study the feedbacks to upland hydrologic and ecosystem states and fluxes provided by channels. We employ a physically-based surface-subsurface processes model (PAWS+CLM) that fully resolves the multi-way interactions between channel flow, overland flow, groundwater, soil water and wetlands. We found notable influences of channels on land surface fluxes, which are explained by the baseflow mechanism and the efficient conveyance mechanism. We systematically quantify the extent of the impact and link channel characteristics to these impacts. Our results indicate that to further improve our understanding of the land-water system, the influence of channels need to be included in integrated models.",

            "abstract": "In natural sediments changes in pressure and temperature may induce the dissociation of naturally occurring gas hydrates. The dissociation of the solid hydrates as well as the increase of a gas phase due to hydrate dissociation may cause or facilitate geo hazards such as slope failure [1]. Therefore, the understanding of hydrate distribution, dissociation and (re-) formation processes which in turn may alter the geomechanical properties of the sediments are of great importance for the prediction on hydrate behavior. During the last decades both, hydrate formation and dissociation, have been studied manifold in laboratory experiments to get a better understanding of these processes. However, the experimental set ups and chosen conditions such as pressure, temperature, sediments, and water saturation vary significantly and do not always simulate natural systems. Within the German national project SUGAR we developed a large LAboratory Reservoir Simulator LARS to study hydrate behavior in sediments. LARS has a total volume of 425 L and has been successfully equipped with an electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). The hydrates form from methane saturated saline water in absence of a free gas phase. Measurements of the dissolved methane at the sample in- and outlet together with temperature monitoring at different locations inside the sediment and ERT measurements are used to describe and characterize the formation process. The ERT and temperature measurements allow for a detection of spatial differences. It could be shown that in this laboratory simulation hydrate forms as it is assumed for natural scenarios. Dissociation processes induced by pressure decrease or temperature increase as well as the consecutive migration of gases and fluids were also studied. To complete the understanding of decisive factors on hydrate formation and fluid flow we investigated the influence of grain sizes on hydrate formation and the influence of hydrate saturation on permeability. In this contribution we present the experimental set up and discuss the results with regard to the analogies and differences to natural systems.\n[1] Jürgen Mienert, Maarten Vanneste, Stefan Bünz, Karin Andreassen, Haflidi Haflidason, Hans Petter Sejrup, Marine and Petroleum Geology 22 (2005) 233–244.",

            "abstract": "Simulations with a coupled atmosphere - ocean - sea ice GCM with idealized ocean basin configuration reveal a very cold ``Waterbelt\" climate with sea ice extending into the tropics in both hemispheres. This is one of four possible climatic equilibria in the model, all of which are found at present-day CO2and insolation. Each equilibrium has radically different global mean temperatures and sea ice extent, and the model exhibits hysteresis in the transitions between states.\nI will discuss the dynamics of the Waterbelt. This climate has no analog in simple albedo feedback theories of climate - ice interaction, yet is stable over a wide parameter range in two different configurations of the numerical model. It is stabilized by a fundamentally coupled atmosphere - ocean - ice dynamical mechanism involving meridional shifts of winds and ocean circulation. The main atmospheric baroclinic zones are roughly coincident with the ice margins, with consequent equatorward contraction of storm tracks and associated surface wind patterns relative to their usual positions. The oceanic thermocline is much shallower and outcrops in the tropics, with an associated vigorous but shallow overturning cell that provides about 100 W m-2 heating at the ice margins. The amplitude of the seasonal cycle of sea ice is very small due to this energetic barrier. The Waterbelt climate is stable in the model over a range of radiative forcing roughly equivalent to 5-6 doublings of CO2. These findings suggest that the initiation of Snowball Earth is a fundamentally coupled problem in which tropical ocean dynamics play a major role.\nThe multiple equilibria were found through a series of numerical parameter sweeps. In some cases the discoveries were guided by theory and physical intuition; however the Waterbelt discovery was a true ``accident” that has led to new and richer physical insight into the dynamics of very cold climates. I will briefly review the history of these discoveries and argue for more organized exploration of our model parameter spaces.",

            "abstract": "Many bulk microphysics parameterizations assume that the droplet size distribution (DSD) of hydrometeor species such as cloud water and rain water conform to a gamma probability distribution function (PDF). Such an assumption is necessary in order to simplify the description of microphysical processes in such bulk parameterizations. The gamma PDF has a parameter that influences the width of the distribution that is commonly referred to as the shape parameter. In one- and two-moment bulk microphysics schemes, this parameter is often arbitrarily set to a fixed value throughout the simulation. This is in part due to limited observations of the shape parameter. While many studies have sought to understand this parameter for rain, few studies examine this parameter for cloud droplets.\nIn this study, we use high-resolution simulations of shallow cumulus clouds with a spectral bin representation of the hydrometeor species to find best-fit parameters of the gamma PDF to the predicted cloud DSDs. These simulations reveal that the cloud shape parameter is high in the supersaturated regions of the cloud and low in regions where the cloud water is evaporating. Values many times higher than the standard values of 1-4 are not uncommon in the bin simulations. The results of this analysis are used to suggest appropriate values of the cloud shape parameter in simulations employing a bulk microphysics scheme. The sensitivity of cloud properties, dynamics, and rainfall to the cloud shape parameter are investigated in simulations in which the parameter is fixed. Conclusions about the importance of choosing an appropriate cloud shape parameter for simulating cumulus clouds in climate or weather models are drawn.",

In order to improve the performance of SDP, this project evaluates the impact of re-updating the policy at every time step by using Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP). We present a case study of the Kemano’s hydropower system on the Nechako River in British Columbia, Canada. Managed by Rio Tinto Alcan (RTA), this system is subject to large streamflow volumes in spring due to important amount of snow depth during the winter season. Therefore, the operating policy should not only maximize production but also minimize the risk of flooding. The hydrological behavior of the system is simulated with CEQUEAU, a distributed and deterministic hydrological model developed by the Institut national de la recherche scientifique - Eau, Terre et Environnement (INRS-ETE) in Quebec, Canada. On each decision time step, CEQUEAU is used to generate ESP scenarios based on historical meteorological sequences and the current state of the hydrological model. These scenarios are used into the SDP to optimize the new release policy for the next time steps. This routine is then repeated over the entire simulation period. Results are compared with those obtained by using SDP on historical inflow scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Hydrothermal circulation is an important component of global biogeochemical cycles. Chemical exchange between seawater and the ocean crust affects the composition of the oceans, the ocean crust, and via subduction the composition and heterogeneity of the mantle. Despite 50 years of scientific ocean drilling, the ultimate goal of drilling a continuous in-situ section through the entire ocean crust has not yet been achieved. The absence of complete oceanic crustal sections makes full quantification of the hydrothermal contributions to global geochemical cycles difficult. In particular, our knowledge of the nature and extent of fluid-rock interaction in the lower crust is limited by the absence of accessible submarine exposures or drill core.\nMacquarie Island, approximately 1500 km south of New Zealand, is the only sub-aerial exposure of a complete section of ocean crust in the ocean basin in which it formed. The crust formed during a phase of slow spreading along a short segment of mid-ocean ridge ~11 Myr ago and was uplifted during recent transpression along the Pacific Australian plate boundary. Hydrothermally altered rocks from Macquarie Island therefore provide a time-integrated record of the chemical changes due to fluid-rock exchange through a complete section of ocean crust.\nWe exploit the immobile behavior of some elements during hydrothermal alteration to determine the precursor compositions to altered Macquarie whole rock samples, and then evaluate the changes in bulk rock chemistry due to fluid-rock interaction throughout the Macquarie crust. We combine these data with stratigraphic reconstructions through the Macquarie crust to determine its net hydrothermal contributions to global geochemical cycles. The Macquarie crust was a net sink for Mn, Mg, Na, K, Cs and Ba and a net source of Fe, Ca, Cu and Sr to the oceans.\nTo assess the role of hydrothermal circulation in global geochemical cycles we compare the calculated Macquarie hydrothermal fluxes to published estimates of the hydrothermal contributions from (i) drilled sections of in-situ upper ocean crust produced at slow, intermediate and fast spreading rates and of differing crustal ages; and (ii) supra-subduction zone ophiolites, which consistently record a greater extent of fluid-rock exchange than crust from mid-ocean ridges.",

            "abstract": "The phenomena of cross-polar cap potential (CPCP) and ionospheric field-aligned current (FAC) saturation remains largely unexplained. In this study, we expand upon the Alfvén Wing model of CPCP saturation by investigating its impact on the magnetosphere-ionosphere current system, particularly the Region 1 FAC input into the polar cap. Our hypothesis is that the ability of open flux tubes to deform in response to applied fluid stress from the magnetosheath is governed by the magnetosheath plasma beta, which in turn governs the Maxwell stress imposed on ionospheric plasma from the magnetosphere. This leads both the Region 1 FAC input as well as the ionospheric convection strength, as represented by the CPCP, to saturate in response to the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) driving. We perform 32 simulations using the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM) Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model with varying solar wind density and IMF strength, and demonstrate that the plasma beta does govern the deformation of polar cap and lobe field lines, as well as the non-linear response of the Region 1 FAC system to increasingly southward IMF. Further, we show that the current-voltage relationship in the ionosphere also shows a dependence on the plasma beta in the magnetosheath, with the ionosphere becoming more resistive at lower beta.",

            "abstract": "Vegetation dynamics, such as forest loss, are an important factor in global climate, but long-term and consistent information on these dynamics on continental scales is lacking. We have quantified large-scale forest loss over the 90s and 00s in the tropical biomes of South America using a passive-microwave satellite-based vegetation product.\nOur forest loss estimates are based on remotely sensed vegetation optical depth (VOD), which is an indicator of vegetation water content simultaneously retrieved with soil moisture. The advantage of low-frequency microwave remote sensing is that aerosols and clouds do not affect the observations. Furthermore, the longer wavelengths of passive microwaves penetrate deeper into vegetation than other products derived from optical and thermal sensors. This has the consequence that both woody parts of vegetation and leaves can be observed. The merged VOD product of AMSR-E and SSM/I observations, which covers over 23 years of daily observations, is used.\nWe used this data stream and an outlier detection algorithm to quantify spatial and temporal variations in forest loss dynamics. Qualitatively, our results compared favorably to the newly developed Global Forest Change (GFC) maps based on Landsat data (r2=0.96), and this allowed us to convert the VOD outlier count to forest loss.\nOur results are spatially explicit with a 0.25-degree resolution and annual time step and we will present our estimates on country level. The added benefit of our results compared to GFC is the longer time period. The results indicate a relatively steady increase in forest loss in Brazil from 1989 until 2003, followed by two high forest loss years and a declining trend afterwards. This contrasts with other South American countries such as Bolivia and Peru, where forest losses increased in almost the whole 00s in comparison with the 90s.",

Still, the question remains: how detailed must our models be to be accurate enough, yet simple enough to be able to scale them from plots to landscapes? Here we use field data to constrain 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D light models and integrate them with simple forest models to predict net primary production (NPP) across an Andes-to-Amazon elevation transect in Peru. Field data consist of novel vertical light profile measurements coupled with airborne LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data from the Carnegie Airborne Observatory. Preliminary results indicate that while 1-D models may be “good-enough” and highly-scalable where forest structure is relatively homogenous, more complex models become important as forest structure becomes more heterogeneous. We discuss the implications our results hold for prediction of NPP under a changing climate, and suggest paths forward for useful proxies of light availability in forests to improve and scale up forest models.",

            "abstract": "Solfatara, the most active crater of Phlegrean Fields (Italy) is characterized by a fumarolic activity and an intense diffuse degassing, with 1500 tons of CO2 and > 3000 tons of water vapor released per day. A major part of the emitted water vapor is condensed at the near surface producing a thermal power flux around 100 MW, and contributing substantially to the total water input into the hydrothermal system. On May 2014, during a seismic experiment (RICEN) in the frame of the MED-SUV European project, a Minivib vibratory seismic source was used to generate a frequency modulated seismic signal at different points of Solfatara. We performed CO2 flux measurements at a few meters from the seismic source during the vibrations. In certain points, the vibrations induced a remarkable increase in the CO2 diffuse degassing, with a flux that doubled during the low-frequency seismic vibrations and returned to previous values afterwards. The observed CO2 flux increase could be due to permeability enhancement in the sub-surface soil layers during the seismic vibrations.\nClose to Fangaia mud pool, we also monitored the soil temperature at different levels above the condensation depth and observed transient temperature changes during the vibrations but also outside the vibration periods. Seismic vibrations likely favor the triggering of thermal instabilities of gravitational or convective origin in the liquid-saturated condensate layer.",

            "abstract": "Agricultural irrigation practice is one of the important anthropogenic processes in the land surface modeling. Irrigation can decrease local surface temperature with alternating surface energy partitioning. Rice paddy is the major food crop in Asian monsoon region and rice is grown under flooded conditions during the growing season; hence, the rice paddy can be considered as an open water body, which has more impacts on the surface energy budget than other cropland does. In this study, we explore how the rice paddy area changes affect Taiwan’s regional climate from both observational data and numerical modeling exercise. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is utilized to explore impacts of rice paddy area changes on the regional climate, and energy and water budget changes. In addition, temperature datasets from six automatic weather stations in the northern Taiwan and two stations in the southern Taiwan are analyzed in this study to explore how the Daily Temperature Range (DTR) changes with the decreased rice paddy areas. Previous studies show that due to the urban heat island effect, aerosol direct and indirect effects, and global warming, the DTR has decreased in the past 4 decades observed from most of the weather stations around Taiwan. However, the declined rice paddy area may increase the DTR with higher Bowen ratio during the daytime. Preliminary results show that DTR is decreased in weather stations near the urban area, but increased in weather stations near fallow areas in the past 20 years. It shows that different land use changes may have opposite impacts on local and regional climate.",

            "abstract": "Seismic full-waveform inversion (FWI) is a method for estimating mainly velocity structure in the subsurface. As wave propagation is influenced by elastic parameter Vp, Vs and density, it is necessary to include these parameters in the modeling and in the inversion (Virieux and Operto 2009). On the other hand, multi-parameter full waveform inversion is a challenging problem because parameters are coupled with each other, and the coupling effects prevent from the appropriate estimation of the elastic parameters. Especially, the estimation of density is of a very difficult exercise because plural elastic parameters including density increases the dimension of the solution space so that any minimization could be trapped in local minima. Therefore, density is usually estimated using an empirical formula such as Gardner's relationship (Gardner et al., 1974) or is fixed to a constant value. Almost all elastic FWI studies have neglected the influence of inverting density parameter because of its difficulty. Since the density parameter is directly included in elastic wave equation, it is necessary to see if it is possible to estimate density value exactly or not. Moreover, Gardner's relationship is an empirical equation and could not always show the exact relation between Vp and density, for example in media such as salt dome. Pre-salt exploration conducted in recent decades could accordingly be influences.\nThe objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of the estimation of density structure when inverting with the other elastic parameters and to see if density is separable from the other parameters. We perform 2D numerical simulations in order to see the most important factor in the inversion of density structure as well as Vp and Vs. We first apply a P-S separation scheme to obtain P and S wavefields to apply our waveform inversion scheme to estimate Vp and density distributions simultaneously. Then we similarly estimate, Vs and density distributions. We show the effect of the inversion strategies with different parameterization on the estimation of density structures.",

During storm events, the volume of drainage discharge is significantly higher, and with it the mass of particulates exported. The particulates exported in the drainage water associated with tropical storm Isaac contained 47% higher OM, 65% higher TP, and 93% higher labile KCl-P fraction compared to the sediments. Based on the equilibrium P concentrations at the sediment-water interface, surface sediments behave as a source of P to the water column. A seven-day continuous drainage event exported 4.7 to 11.1 metric tons of suspended solids per farm, corresponding to 32 to 63 kg of particulate P being lost to downstream ecosystems. Drainage associated to a single storm event exported up to 64% of the total P load compared to the rest of the year.",

            "abstract": "The importance of low-level cloud feedbacks to climate sensitivity motivates an investigation of how low-level cloud amount, liquid water path, and related meteorological conditions have changed in recent decades in subtropical stratocumulus regions. Using a satellite cloud dataset corrected for inhomogeneities, we find that during 1984-2009 low-level cloud amount significantly increased over the northeast and southeast Pacific, significantly decreased over the northeast Atlantic, and weakly increased over the southeast Atlantic and southeast Indian oceans. During 1988-2012, liquid water path decreased over the northeast Pacific, significantly increased over the southeast Pacific and northeast and southeast Atlantic, and weakly increased over the southeast Indian oceans. Examination of meteorological parameters from four re-analyses indicates that positive trends in low-level cloud amount are associated with decreasing trends in sea surface temperature and increasing trends in inversion strength, subsidence and cold-air advection, and vice-versa. Relationships between liquid water path and meteorological conditions are weaker, but increasing trends in liquid water path are associated with increasing trends in sea surface temperature and decreasing trends in inversion strength, subsidence, and cold-air advection, and vice-versa. A multi-linear regression model based on these four meteorological variables well captures the sign and to certain extent magnitude of observed cloud amount trends in almost all stratocumulus regions, but a similarly constructed model largely fails to reproduce the observed liquid water path trends. Differing signs of cloud trends and differing contributions from meteorological parameters between regions suggest that observed changes in subtropical stratocumulus since the 1980s are primarily due to natural variability rather than a systematic response to climate change.",

            "abstract": "Mesoscale aggregation of convection has been reported in cloud-resolving model (CRM) simulations with relatively small (100-1000km), non-rotating domains. This aggregation is thought to be driven by feedbacks between convection, radiation and tropospheric moisture. It has been suggested that the observed Madden- Julian Oscillation (MJO) is a “moisture mode” driven by physics similar to that of the simulated small-scale aggregation, but alternative theories of the MJO remain viable. Here we show that a super-parameterized global model run with uniform sea surface temperature and no rotation also produces convective aggregation, with a characteristic scale of 2000-5000km. Moisture and moist static energy budgets indicate that the mechanisms driving this large-scale aggregation are similar to those driving aggregation in CRMs. When rotation is added, the model simulates robust MJO activity. A set of mechanism-denial experiments and runs with intermediate rotation are used to link the non-rotating aggregation to the MJO. Implications for MJO theories will be discussed. ",

            "abstract": "The melting and rheology of eclogite is critical for understanding the dynamics of the subduction zone and plate tectonic. Viscosity of eclogite melt as a function of depth is a key parameter to model the long-term chemical evolution of the subduction zone and volcanic magma. It also plays an important role in earthquakes and continent formation. However, the viscosity and rheology of eclogite melt remain poorly understood at high pressure and temperature. In this study, we have carried out in-situ falling-sphere viscometry measurements to determine the viscosity of eclogite melt from 1.3 to 5.6 GPa at temperatures between 1500 and 2000 K, using the Paris-Edinburgh cell at the 16-BM-B beamline of the High Pressure Collaborative Access Team (HPCAT) at the Advanced Photon Source. We used a natural eclogite sample with 47.7wt% SiO2. The viscosity (η) was calculated with the Stokes’ equation. The viscosity of eclogite melt decreases between 1.3 and 5.6 GPa at 2000K. At 1.4 GPa and 2000K the viscosity is 0.43 Pa·s, whereas at 5.6 GPa and 2000 K it is 0.13Pa·s. No minimum in the viscosity of eclogite was found in the measured pressure range up to 5.6 GPa.",

            "abstract": "The atmospheres of close-in extrasolar giant planets such as HD209458b are strongly ionized by the UV flux of their host stars. We show that photoionization on such planets creates a dayside ionosphere that extends from the thermosphere to the 100 mbar level. The resulting peak electron density near the 1 mbar level is higher than that encountered in any planetary ionosphere of the solar system, and the model conductivity is in fact comparable to the atmospheres of Sun-like stars. As a result, the momentum and energy balance in the upper atmosphere of HD209458b and similar planets can be strongly affected by ion drag and resistive heating arising from wind-driven electrodynamics. Despite much weaker ionization, electrodynamics is nevertheless also important on the giant planets of the solar system. We use a generic framework to constrain the conductivity regimes on close-in extrasolar planets, and compare the results with conductivites based on the same approach for Jupiter and Saturn. By using a generalized Ohm’s law and assumed magnetic fields, we then demonstrate the basic effects of wind-driven ion drag in giant planet atmospheres. Our results show that ion drag is often significant in the upper atmosphere where it can also substantially alter the energy budget through resistive heating.",

            "abstract": "Elevated sodium and titanium in pyroxene and spinel with high TiO2 (> 0.2 wt%) are suggested as the geochemical characteristic for the MORB-like melt infiltration of peridotites. The petrological and geochemical results of melt infiltrating in mantle peridotites are controlled by not only the melt composition but also the melt/rock ratio. Large discordant dunite bodies in the mantle transition zone are the direct observation of large volume melt (high melt/rock ratio) infiltrating by channeled porous flow in the shallow mantle (\n1\n). In addition to dunites, melt infiltrating results in a large variety of vein lithologies in mantle, and the occurrence of plagioclases are considered as a petrological signal of melt-reaction at shallow depth (\n2\n,\n3\n) with a medium melt/rock ratio. Because the lacking of obviously petrological and geochemical variation of peridotites, melt infiltration of peridotites with a low melt/rock ratio are rarely reported.\nPeridotites in this study are from the 53° E amagmatic segment at the Southwest Indian Ridge. These peridotites are suggested as highly depleted buoyant mantle drawn up from the asthenosphere beneath southern Africa during the breakup of Gondwanaland (4) and are residues of multi-stage melt extracting in both spinel and garnet field. We present a detailed analysis of mineral compositions by both the EMPA and LA-ICPMS. Mineral phases in 53°E peridotites have mantle major element compositions, although minerals show variations with the crystal size and the location from cores to rims (Fig.1). In conjunction with the profile analysis of large clinopyroxene crystals, our results document the melt infiltration occurred at the ultraslow-spreading environment. At least two kinds of percolation melts are distinguished. They are normally MORB-like melt and ultra-depleted melt.\n",

            "abstract": "We present the first study of the global impacts of a regional nuclear war with an Earth system model including atmospheric chemistry, ocean dynamics, and interactive sea-ice and land models (Mills et al., 2014). A limited, regional nuclear war between India and Pakistan in which each side detonates 50 15-kt weapons could produce about 5 Tg of black carbon. This would self-loft to the stratosphere, where it would spread globally, producing a sudden drop in surface temperatures and intense heating of the stratosphere. Using the Community Earth System Model with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (CESM1(WACCM)), we calculate an e-folding time of 8.7 years for stratospheric black carbon, compared to 4-6.5 years for previous studies (figure panel a). Our calculations show that global ozone losses of 20-50% over populated areas, levels unprecedented in human history, would accompany the coldest average surface temperatures in the last 1000 years (figure panel c). We calculate summer enhancements in UV indices of 30-80% over Mid-Latitudes, suggesting widespread damage to human health, agriculture, and terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Killing frosts would reduce growing seasons by 10-40 days per year for 5 years. Surface temperatures would be reduced for more than 25 years, due to thermal inertia and albedo effects in the ocean and expanded sea ice. The combined cooling and enhanced UV would put significant pressures on global food supplies and could trigger a global nuclear famine. Knowledge of the impacts of 100 small nuclear weapons should motivate the elimination of the more than 17,000 nuclear weapons that exist today.\nMills, M. J., O. B. Toon, J. Lee-Taylor, and A.

            "abstract": "Acoustic recordings reveal a variety of volcanic activities during an exceptionally loud vulcanian eruption at Tungurahua. A period of several months of mild surface activity came to an abrupt end with the emission of a powerful blast wave heard at least 180 km away. Sensors 2080 m from the vent recorded a stepped rise to its maximum overpressure of 1220 Pa (corresponding to a sound pressure level of 156 dB) and its unusually long dominant period of 5.6 s. We discuss source processes that produced the blast wave, considering that wave propagation could be nonlinear near the vent because of high overpressures. More than an hour of acoustic activity was recorded after the blast wave, including sound from falling ballistics, reflections of the blast wave from nearby mountains, pyroclastic density currents, and acoustic tremor at the vent. Glitches in the acoustic records related to plume lightning were also serendipitously observed, although thunder could not be unambiguously identified. We discuss acoustic signatures of falling ballistics and pyroclastic density currents and how array-style deployments and analytic methods can be used to reveal them. Placement of sensors high on the volcano's slopes facilitated resolving these distinct processes. This study demonstrates that near-vent, array-style acoustic installations can be used to monitor various types of volcanic activity.",

            "abstract": "The 27 February 2010, Mw 8.8 Maule earthquake ruptured ~500 km along the plate boundary offshore of central Chile between 34°S and 38.5°S. Intense ground shaking and large tsunami inundation combined to take more than 500 lives. The co-seismic slip distribution has previously been investigated using geodetic, seismic and tsunami observations, yielding consistent locations of the largest slip in a region extending from 34°S to 35.5°S. However, it remains uncertain whether co-seismic fault offset extended to the trench, which is important for interpreting both shallow frictional behavior and potential for tsunami earthquakes in the region. Joint inversion of high-rate GPS, teleseismic body waves, InSAR, and tsunami observations yields a kinematic rupture model with improved resolution of slip near the trench. Two up-dip large-slip (>15 m) patches are resolved along a bi-lateral rupture with relatively uniform 5-10 m slip down-dip beneath the coast. Both up-dip patches have significant slip in localized regions extending to the trench. The peak slip is ~22 m at a depth of ~15 km on the central megathrust, located ~200 km north from the hypocenter and overlapping the rupture zone of the 1928 M ~8 event. The slip decreases at shallower depth, but is still about ~20 m near the trench. The peak slip is ~15 m in a shallow near-trench patch located ~150 km southwest of the hypocenter. Checker-board resolution tests demonstrate that the tsunami data are critical to resolution of slip near the trench, with other data sets allowing, but not requiring slip far offshore. The stability of the joint inversion reduces the need for regularization. Larger events in the aftershock sequence have a complementary distribution to the co-seismic slip pattern, filling in gaps or outlining edges of large-slip zones. Two clusters of normal faulting events locate seaward along the plate motion direction from the localized regions of large near-trench slip, suggesting that proximity of slip to the trench enhanced extensional faulting in the underthrusting plate.

            "abstract": "Groundwater is the largest source of readily available freshwater on our planet. Aquifers are vulnerable to climate change and require new groundwater management plans to account for changing precipitation patterns and sea level rise, among other factors. Building a three dimensional groundwater model as framework for evaluating these changes is fundamental. Ultimately this model will be coupled with the output from several Global Circulation Models and used as a predictive model to determine the impact of climate change on Long Island, New York. This research looks at the process of modeling the physical elements of the groundwater hydrology of Long Island, New York. The model accounts for the unconfined and confined aquifers, as well as the confining zones. Calibration of the model includes visual comparisons with HA-709, a groundwater model built by the USGS in 1989, to illustrate similarities in the model foundation. The model is then calibrated by calculating the root mean square error between historic USGS groundwater data to the models simulated groundwater heads. Looking at how changes in the model impact the calibration process provides insight into model accuracy and modelers’ choices. In this research we show how various combinations of model cell sizes, horizontal hydraulic conductivity, recharge, and drains impact model calibration, and ultimately the model that will be used during the research process.",

            "abstract": "The Anatolian plateau and Caucasus are part of the orogenic belt that formed as the result of the closure of the Neo Tethys Ocean and the ensuing continental collision of Arabian and Eurasian plates. Multiple tomographic studies of both P and S wave velocities all show a broad low velocity zone beneath East Anatolian and North Iranian plateaus. The low velocity zone appears to range from the Moho to a depth 150 km, which suggests asthenospheric material underlying a very thin lithosphere of eastern Anatolia. This low velocity zone coincides with widespread Late Miocene – Quaternary calc–alkaline volcanic products of mantle origin. This very shallow asthenosphere strongly implies that any present day anisotropy is likely to reflect very recent mantle deformation.\nIn order to image seismic anisotropy and improve understanding of the nature of mantle deformation in young continental collision zone we analyzed data from the IRIS station KIV and the regional seismic networks of Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia to determine shear wave splitting fast polarization directions and delay times in the region. Our results show that the fast polarization directions are quite uniformly parallel to NE-SW across the East Anatolian Plateau and the westernmost part of the Greater Caucasus. The observed delay times decrease northward with the shortest located in the western Greater Caucasus. However, to the east, the fast polarization direction rotates clockwise until it becomes parallel to the EW topographic? trend in the Lesser Caucasus where the delay times are the largest in the region. The situation becomes more complex north of the Lesser Caucasus, in the central and eastern parts of the Greater Caucasus, where the fast polarization directions shift abruptly to the NNE-SSW. Furthemore, we find relatively strong evidence of layered anisotropy using a new method we have developed to image multi-layered polarization anisotropy from teleseismic core phases such as SKS.",

            "abstract": "Tropical forests are the largest terrestrial carbon (C) sink, and tropical forest soils contribute disproportionately to the poorly-characterized deep soil C pool. The goal of this study was to evaluate how carbon chemistry and stability change with depth in tropical forest soils formed on two contrasting parent materials. We used soils from pits excavated to 140 cm depth that were stratified across two soil types (Oxisols and Inceptisols) at the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory in northeast Puerto Rico. We used 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to characterize soil C chemistry and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) coupled with evolved gas analysis (CO2-EGA) to evaluate the thermal stability of soil C during ramped combustion. Thirty-four samples with an initial C concentration ≥1% were chosen from discrete depth intervals (0, 30, 60, 90 & 140 cm) for 13C NMR analysis, while DSC was performed on 122 samples that included the NMR sample set and additional samples at 20, 50, 80 and 110 cm depth.\nPreliminary 13C NMR results indicate higher alkyl : O-alkyl ratios and an enrichment of aliphatic and proteinaceous C with depth, compared with greater aromatic and carbohydrate signals in surface soils. The energy density of soil C (J mg-1 C) also declined significantly with depth. In Oxisols, most CO2 evolution from combustion occurred around 300ºC, while most CO2 evolution occurred at higher temperatures (400-500ºC) in Inceptisols. Our findings suggest soil C is derived primarily of plant biomolecules in surface soils and becomes increasingly microbial with depth. Soil matrix-mediated differences in C transport and preservation may result in differences in C chemistry between the two soil types and a more thermally labile C pool in the Oxisols. We suggest that energy-poor substrates, combined with potentially stronger organo-mineral interactions in subsoils, may explain the long-term stability of deep C in highly weathered tropical soils.",

            "abstract": "The devastating 2004 Sumatra earthquake and tsunami brought to the world’s attention the possibility of large megathrust ruptures occurring along the heavily populated coast of Bangladesh. The Sunda-Andaman subduction arc continues into Bangladesh where oblique convergence of the Indian plate with the Burma segment of the arc was measured at GPS rates of 14 mm/yr. A long section of the megathurst ruptured during the 1762 Great Arakan earthquake along the Myanmar coast. A 1762 tsunami was reported from historic accounts and predicted from modelling, but geologic evidence for it was not previously reported.\nSt Martin’s Island and the Teknaf peninsula in SE Bangladesh are expressions of anticlines in the outer part of the accretionary prism of the Arakan subduction boundary. Our lithology, biostratigraphy and C-14 ages in this region provide evidence for a possible tsunami associated with the 1762 earthquake and validate the continuity of the rupture zone for as much as 700 km, from the Myanmar coast, Bay of Bengal shelf to the Sitakund anticline inland. In St. Martin’s, ≈70 km north of the shelf break, U-Th ages from ~2 m uplifted dead corals provide evidence for the 1762 rupture. The associated tsunami was dated from benthic foraminifers and marine molluscs obtained from a shell bed in a trench, and from the top of marine terraces possibly uplifted during 1762 or prior earthquakes. In Teknaf a chaotic bed containing benthic foraminifers, marine shells and cobble size rocks, extends for 100's of meters on top of the 2 m uplifted terrace. The marine molluscs were dated at 1695-1791 AD.\nThe large ≈2m uplift found in the region is likely to be deformation associated with the 1762 rupture and could also be partly related to anelastic growth of the accretion wedge and anticlines. It is likely now slowly subsiding due to continuing elastic loading of the megathrust. To produce that large coastal, presumably coseismic, uplift, the megathrust rupture must have reached at least that far updip (west). That uplift can be achieved by a large displacement on the megathrust below that coastline and/or by displacement along the steeper imbricate thrust faults responsible for the anticlines. Because the thrust front lies in shallow water a large tsunami would not be expected consistent with geological observations that point to low height tsunami waves.",

            "abstract": "Tephra provide a valuable tool for palaeoenvironmental reconstructions when correctly identified. Here we present three approaches to discriminate between the Oldest, Middle and Younger Toba Tuff (OTT, MTT and YTT, respectively), these being three major Quaternary eruptions of the Toba volcano in Sumatra, Indonesia. Toba ash forms an important stratigraphic marker across peninsular India, and it has been widely used for archaeological and palaeoenvironmental studies. Major element ratios in YTT show post-depositional diagenetic effects from ash-environment interaction. Na2O/K2O varies up to 50% between marine and terrestrial sites, because of seawater induced alkali migration and site-specific water pH. However, major elements cannot discriminate between OTT and YTT, but these can be identified using trace elements data. Compiling several hundreds analyses of selected rare elements, four glass populations are recognized, which define the YTT and represent different stages of magma evolution. In contrast, OTT has one, homogeneous, low Ba glass population. Thus, the presence of multiple glass populations now allows the YTT to be clearly distinguished from OTT and MTT. This discrimination was used to resolve the issue surrounding the age of Toba ash from Morgaon, a tephra deposit in western India recently dated at c. 809 ka (Ar-Ar). New LA-ICP-MS analyses revealed that the Morgaon tephra contains the same four glass populations that define YTT, indicating this cannot be OTT. In addition, a study of the area density of spontaneous fission tracks (ρs) in glass shards of the Morgaon tephra sample (91±19 tracks/cm2) are within the range of the YTT (70-181 tracks/cm2) and well below the OTT (1567 tracks/cm2), again confirming its YTT origins. Indeed, all other Toba tephra occurrences from India thus far analysed for trace elements and spontaneous FT density show a YTT origin.",

            "abstract": "We present the first measurements of SO2 emissions at Semeru volcano, Indonesia, using an SO2 camera. Activity at Semeru is characterized by quiescent degassing interspersed with short-lived explosive events with low ash burden. The interval between explosions was measured at 32.1±15.7 minutes in a webcam survey of the volcano between the months of June and December 2013. We distinguish between two types of events: shorter events (type I: ~5 mins duration) with emissions returning quickly to baseline levels, and longer events (type II: ~15 mins duration) often showing multiple pulses and a longer period of increased emissions before a return to quiescent levels. Type I events represent >90% of the activity and release an average of 200-450 kg of SO2 per event. The single type II event we documented with the SO2 camera released a total of 1300 kg of SO2. We estimate the daily average emissions of Semeru to be 21-60 t d-1 of SO2, amounting to a yearly output of 7.5-22 Gg (7,500 – 22,000 metric tons), with 35-60% released during explosive events. The time series patterns of degassing are consistent with the existence of a viscous plug at the top of the conduit, causing accumulation and pressurization of the magma to produce the explosive events.",

            "abstract": "Wairakei-Tauhara (WK-TH) is one of the largest geothermal systems in the actively rifting Taupo Volcanic Zone. SIMS U-Pb dating of magmatic zircons (using SHRIMP-RG) from hydrothermally altered rhyolitic lavas and ignimbrites has provided new ages which constrain the major episodes of locally sourced volcanism and basin subsidence that were major influences on structural evolution and hydrology of the system. The WK-TH system is located in the southern Taupo-Reporoa Basin (TRB) across a horst-graben structure defined by predominantly NE-SW striking faults of the Taupo Rift. The geothermal system is hosted in late Quaternary volcanic and sedimentary strata and underlying Jurassic-Cretaceous greywacke basement. When combined with a robust stratigraphic architecture refined using data from >200 geothermal wells up to 3 km deep, the dating reveals that the majority of all known WK-TH rhyolite lavas (each ~0.1 km3 to ~7 km3) were extruded in a relatively short time interval from ~ 310 ka to ~120 ka and occur in a spatial cluster in the uppermost ~1.5 km of strata beneath the north-western (Wairakei) area. Stratigraphy and dating revealed at least one local rhyolite extrusion occurred at ~ 940 ka, and also an apparent >500 ka lapse in volcanic activity or local deposition after that event. The ages of strata from the Tauhara (south-eastern) area make it clear that a substantial volume of ignimbrite was emplaced into then eroded from the southern TRB between ~0.35 and 0.31 Ma, and then after ~0.31 Ma, replaced with as much as 2.5 km thickness of tuffs and sediments. Correlation by age of the locally named Wairakei Ignimbrite with the regional ~349 ka Whakamaru group of ignimbrites reinforces the value of this unit as a key stratigraphic marker and constrains the timing of major fault formation/reactivation, potentially with implications for understanding the structure and subsidence of Whakamaru caldera and evolution of the Taupo-Reporoa Basin.",

Such a placement of sensors allows for year-round monitoring of water and hence, the ability to measure at times of year and during extreme weather events that previously made monitoring infeasible. The sensor array was installed on 17 June 2014 and draws water from the penstock at a rate of 6-10 L per minute. Sensors in flow through chambers collect data on temperature, turbidity, color dissolved organic material (CDOM), phycocyanin, chlorophyll-a, and specific conductivity at one minute intervals. In combination with a hydrodynamic flow model we are able to hind-cast water movements so that the quality of water passing through the dam can be related to environmental conditions in the river upstream from the sensor array. We conducted field surveys using sensors in a ferry box on a vessel moving upstream (40 km) at a velocity providing a spatial resolution of 100 m and determined that main channel water is more homogenous than water along the shorelines (2 m isopleth) of the river, despite the high turbulence in this river. The sensor array located in the turbine unit nearest the US shore is able to discern tributary inputs for CDOM from the Oswegatchie River (discharge 40-120 m3/s), located 67 km upstream. This research is an important proof-of-concept for installing similar arrays in dams throughout the Great Lakes region and is applicable to smaller rivers containing power dams.",

            "abstract": "The Stillwater J-M reef, the only economic platinum deposit in the USA, consists of a 0.5 to 4 m-thick stratiform zone of platinum group element (PGE)-rich sulfides in a layered mafic intrusion. The origin of this reef, purely magmatic or related to late-stage magmatic fluids, remains ambiguous. I propose to test these two genetic hypotheses using rock magnetism. Fractional crystallization trends deduced from petrological models would produce a sharp increase in magnetite and pyrrhotite content near the solidus. In contrast, percolation of sulfur-rich fluids through a crystal mush would produce a gradual increase in magnetite and pyrrhotite up to a fluid permeability barrier. Continuous logging of the magnetic properties of drillcores, combined with petrographic observations, will allow to test these two models.\nPetrologic similarities between PGE reefs suggest that they share common physico-chemical origins, therefore, understanding the J-M reef genesis would have implications for other deposits such as the Bushveld Complex and the Great Dyke of Zimbabwe. The J-M reef formation has been explained by two alternative models: 1) magmatic model - magma replenishment causes thermal convection at the interface between two magmas, inducing PGE leaching by a sulfur-saturated magma, followed by precipitation of sulfide droplets; 2) fluid fluxing model - a sulfur-rich residual, late magmatic fluid migrates upward through the crystal mush leading to PGE concentration along a magmatic permeability barrier against the hanging wall. Both models account for the majority of geochemical and petrological observations and may not be fundamentally mutually exclusive. However, understanding the origin of PGE reefs would certainly benefit from new approaches.\nPreliminary data shows systematic inch-scale cycling variations of magnetic susceptibility (Km) in the hanging-wall that supports the magmatic model. The discovery of this magnetic cyclicity matters because this core does not display any macroscopically visible layering. Magnetic measurements (thermomagnetic experiments, magnetic hysteresis and first order reversal curves), in conjunction with detailed petrographic observations on selected specimens, will be performed to evaluate the significance of this cyclic feature.",

            "abstract": "Implementation of reservoir sedimentation management approaches results in a win-win scenario, it assists in enhancing the environment by preserving river function downstream of dams while concurrently providing opportunities to sustainably manage water resource infrastructure. This paper summarizes the most often used reservoir sedimentation management techniques with examples of where they have been implemented. Three categories can be used to classify these technologies, i.e. catchment management, sediment routing and sediment removal. The objective of catchment management techniques is to minimize the amount of sediment that may discharge into a reservoir, thereby reducing the loss of storage space due to sedimentation. Reservoir routing is a set of techniques that aim at minimizing the amount of sediment that may deposit in a reservoir, thereby maximizing the amount of sediment that may be passed downstream. The third group consists of techniques that may be used to remove previously deposited sediment from reservoirs. The selection of reservoir sedimentation management approaches is site specific and depends on various factors, including dam height, reservoir volume, reservoir length, valley shape, valley slope, sediment type and hydrology. Description of the different reservoir sedimentation management techniques that are used in practice will be accompanied by case studies, including video, illustrating criteria that may be used to determine the potential success of implementing the techniques.",

            "abstract": "Although terrestrial environments play a critical role in cycling water, greenhouse gasses, and other life-critical elements, the complexity of interactions among component microbes, plants, minerals, migrating fluids and dissolved constituents hinders predictive understanding of system behavior. The ‘Sustainable Systems 2.0’ project is developing genome-to-watershed scale predictive capabilities to quantify how the microbiome affects biogeochemical watershed functioning, how watershed-scale hydro-biogeochemical processes affect microbial functioning, and how these interactions co-evolve with climate and land-use changes. Development of such predictive capabilities is critical for guiding the optimal management of water resources, contaminant remediation, carbon stabilization, and agricultural sustainability – now and with global change.\nInitial investigations are focused on floodplains in the Colorado River Basin, and include iterative model development, experiments and observations with an early emphasis on subsurface aspects. Field experiments include local-scale experiments at Rifle CO to quantify spatiotemporal metabolic and geochemical responses to O2and nitrate amendments as well as floodplain-scale monitoring to quantify genomic and biogeochemical response to natural hydrological perturbations. Information obtained from such experiments are represented within GEWaSC, a Genome-Enabled Watershed Simulation Capability, which is being developed to allow mechanistic interrogation of how genomic information stored in a subsurface microbiome affects biogeochemical cycling.\nThis presentation will describe the genome-to-watershed scale approach as well as early highlights associated with the project. Highlights include: first insights into the diversity of the subsurface microbiome and metabolic roles of organisms involved in subsurface nitrogen, sulfur and hydrogen and carbon cycling; the extreme variability of subsurface DOC and hydrological controls on carbon and nitrogen cycling; geophysical identification of floodplain hotspots that are useful for model parameterization; and GEWaSC demonstration of how incorporation of identified microbial metabolic processes improves prediction of the larger system biogeochemical behavior.",

Recently, we developed a technique to analyze the sulfur isotope composition (δ34S) of volcanic glasses. Since no interlaboratory reference material is available for this purpose, we carried out piston cylinder experiments to create artificial glasses of known sulfur isotope composition. We used natural sulfides mixed with CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 (with PtO2 in 5 mm Pt capsule) and high-Ti Mare basalt powder (graphite capsule inside the Pt capsule). Experimental conditions were set to 1400°C, 5 kbar and 4 hours. We used these artificial glasses to survey sulfur isotope fractionation during our experimental runs and for use as standard material with calibrated δ34S. Additionally, natural standards Juan de Fuca basalt (VG-2), Makaopuhi basalt (VG-A99; Hawai’i), SEIR MORB (NMNH 113716), and one rhyolite (VG-568) were analyzed repeatedly to provide sulfur isotope data of commonly used natural glass standards.\nIODP expedition 351 to the Amami-Sankaku Basin adjacent to the Kyushu-Palau Ridge in June-July 2014 recovered a variety of rocks related to the history of the Izu-Bonin Mariana (IBM) Arc. Basalts of the oceanic igneous crust underlying the IBM arc give us information of the basement prior to arc initiation and volcaniclastic rocks eroded from active volcanoes of the IBM arc record its evolution from inception in the Eocene through Oligocene and Miocene. Ash layers intercalated in hemipelagic sediments record the evolution of the IBM and Ryukyu arcs during the Neogene. The aim of this study is to track changes in the oxidation state of island arc magmas and the mantle wedge during the time of arc initiation. Experimental results as well as preliminary data from IODP Exp. 351 will be presented by the time of the conference.",

            "abstract": "It is now well established that extraction of fossil fuels and/or waste water disposal do cause earthquakes in Central and Eastern United States (CEUS). However, the physics underneath of the nucleation of induced earthquakes still remain elusive. In particular, do induced and tectonic earthquake sequences in CEUS share the same statistics, for example the Omori’s law [Utsu et al., 1995] and the Gutenberg-Richter’s law? Some studies have show that most naturally occurring earthquake sequences are driven by cascading-type triggering. Hence, they would follow the typical Gutenberg-Richter relation and Omori’s aftershock decay and could be well described by multi-dimensional point-process models such as Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) [Ogata, 1988; Zhuang et al., 2012]. However, induced earthquakes are likely driven by external forcing such as injected fluid pressure, and hence would not be well described by the ETAS model [Llenos and Michael, 2013]. Existing catalogs in CEUS (e.g. the ANSS catalog) have relatively high magnitude of completeness [e.g., Van Der Elst et al., 2013] and hence may not be ideal for a detailed ETAS modeling analysis. A waveform matched filter technique has been successfully applied to detect many missing earthquakes in CEUS with a sparse network in Illinois [Yang et al., 2009] and on single station in Texas, Oklahoma and Colorado [e.g., Van Der Elst et al., 2013]. In addition, the deployment of the USArray station in CEUS also helped to expand the station coverage. In this study, we systematically detect missing events during 14 moderate-size (M>=4) earthquake sequences since 2000 in CEUS and quantify their statistical parameters (e.g. b, a, K, and p values) and spatio-temporal evolutions. Then we compare the statistical parameters and the spatio-temporal evolution pattern between induced and naturally occurring earthquake sequences to see if one or more diagnostic parameters exist. Our comprehensive analysis of earthquake sequences in CEUS will hopefully shed new insight on whether intrinsic differences exist between induced and naturally occurring earthquakes.",

To study how the initial speed of the CMEs influences the CMEs collision process, five cases with different initial speed and speed difference are selected. Results show that whether the collision of CMEs could be super-elastic or not is mostly rely on the initial speed difference of the two CMEs rather than the initial speed itself.

This human- and partially nature-induced ground deformation has gradually threatened the stability of urban infrastructure and caused the loss of wetland habitat along the Gulf of Mexico. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) exploiting multiple SAR images has the capability of obtaining ground motions in high spatial resolution over large coverage. In this study, ERS-1/2 (1993-2000), ENVISAT (2004-2010), and ALOS (2007-2011) datasets are used to unravel the characteristics of ground deformation from 1993 to 2011 over the Houston-Galveston area. The persistent scatterer InSAR (PSInSAR) time-series analysis technique is employed to estimate the spatial and temporal variations of ground motions during 20 years. The ERS-1/2 PSInSAR products have measured subsidence (up to 5 cm/yr) in the northwest Houston area as well as a slight uplift (1 cm/yr) in the southeast region from 1993 to 2000. The subsidence rate (up to 2 cm/yr) between 2004 and 2011 has been obtained from ENVISAT and ALOS data. Our results indicate that the pattern of ground deformation was nearly concentric around the location of intense groundwater withdrawal and the subsiding area has been shrinking and migrating toward the northeast after 2000. In addition, an approximately 2 cm of differential subsidence across faults are observed. Presence of faults can induce localized surface displacements, aggravate localized subsidence, discontinue the integrity of ground water flow, and limit the horizontal spread of subsidence funnels. Finally, our long-term measurement of ground deformation has also been validated by GPS observations in study area.",

We present results from deformation-DIA experiments on antigorite serpentinite performed under conditions relevant of subduction zones (1-3.5 GPa ; 400-650°C). We complemented our study with a sample deformed in a Griggs-type apparatus at 1 GPa and 400°C (Chernak and Hirth, EPSL, 2010), and with natural samples from Cuba and the Alps deformed under blueschist/eclogitic conditions. Our observations on experimental samples of antigorite deformed within its stability field show that deformation is dominated by cataclastic flow; we can only document a minor contribution of plastic deformation. In naturally deformed samples, deformation-related plastic structures largely dominate strain accommodation, but we also document a minor contribution of brittle deformation. When dehydration occurs in experiments, plasticity increases, and is coupled to local embrittlement attributed to hydraulic fracturating due to the migration of dehydration fluids. Our results thus show that semibrittle deformation operates within and above the stability field of antigorite. We also document that the corrugated structure of antigorite has a control on the strain accommodation mechanisms under subduction conditions, with preferred inter and intra-cracking along (001) and gliding along both a and b. Deformation dominated by brittle processes, as observed in experiments, may occur during deformation at elevated (seismic?) strain rates, while plastic deformation, as observed in naturally deformed rocks, may correspond instead to low strain rates instead (aseismic creep?). We also discuss the role of antigorite rheology and mode of deformation on fluid transport.",

In this study, we investigated the associated climatic controls on the start of growing season (SOS) derived from three widely-used satellite NDVI datasets in the TP grasslands, together with a satellite-derived freeze-thaw dataset and in-situ meteorological observations. Our results show that the SOS of TP grasslands is generally negatively correlated with spring temperature (Ta) from 1982 to 2008 (R<-0.40, p<0.05), while the temperature effects are strongly regulated by spring precipitation (P), with the interaction of temperature and precipitation effects varying across the TP areas. In the steppe-dominated western TP region (spring Ta=-3.3 oC, P=23.0 mm), P is increasingly positively correlated with SOS during the period of 1996-2008, i.e. more precipitation tends to delay spring onset. This is likely because a strong increasing precipitation trend (0.49 mm yr-1, p<0.05) in this area gradually relieves the spring water deficit, and more precipitation is generally associated with low heat. However, in the relatively humid eastern region dominated by meadow (spring Ta =-3.5 oC, P=72.9 mm), P becomes less positively correlated with the SOS. This is likely caused by increasing spring water deficit due to a strong warming trend (0.045 oC yr-1, p<0.05), and a slight decline in spring P (-0.071 mm yr-1, p>0.1). Similarly, the whole TP generally shows an advancing trend in spring thawing (0.35 day yr-1, p<0.05), which has an increasingly positive effect on spring onset, especially in the meadow areas. Our results demonstrate the strong regulation of precipitation on TP vegetation spring phenology, which may become more important for understanding vegetation response to climate change with continuing warming.",

            "abstract": "The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) is designed to compute the best time series of (nearly) global precipitation from \"all\" precipitation-relevant satellites and global surface precipitation gauge analyses. IMERG was developed to use GPM Core Observatory data as a reference for the international constellation of satellites of opportunity that constitute the GPM virtual constellation. Computationally, IMERG is a unified U.S. algorithm drawing on strengths in the three contributing groups, whose previous work includes:\n1) the TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA);\n2) the CPC Morphing algorithm with Kalman Filtering (K-CMORPH); and\n3) the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks using a Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS).\nWe review the IMERG design, development, testing, and current status. IMERG provides 0.1°x0.1° half-hourly data, and will be run at multiple times, providing successively more accurate estimates: 4 hours, 8 hours, and 2 months after observation time. In Day 1 the spatial extent is 60°N-S, for the period March 2014 to the present. In subsequent reprocessing the data will extend to fully global, covering the period 1998 to the present. Both the set of input data set retrievals and the IMERG system are substantially different than those used in previous U.S. products. The input passive microwave data are all being produced with GPROF2014, which is substantially upgraded compared to previous versions. For the first time, this includes microwave sounders. Accordingly, there is a strong need to carefully check the initial test data sets for performance. IMERG output will be illustrated using pre-operational test data, including the variety of supporting fields, such as the merged-microwave and infrared estimates, and the precipitation type. Finally, we will summarize the expected release of various output products, and the subsequent reprocessing sequence.",

            "abstract": "The Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) was established in the mid-1990’s to determine whether the then-new passive microwave sensors could reliably depict quasi-global variations in precipitation, in particular those associated with El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. This international community-based effort was successful, and its data record now extends past 35 years. In the process, we have found ways to use estimates from sensors flying before the passive microwave era, and estimates for polar regions in which the passive microwave retrievals are not useful, as well as providing pentad (5-day) and daily estimates (the latter for a subset of the 1979-present record). Several versions have been released as lessons learned and new input datasets have been applied to the computation. Among these lessons are the importance of maintaining consistency in input data sources, requiring consistent processing for the entire record of input datasets, and ensuring completeness in data coverage. The resulting data sets were not originally designed to be formal Climate Data Records (CDRs), but they do emphasize homogeneity, high quality, and stability in the input data sets.\nThe success of the datasets has raised user expectations and encouraged a variety of analyses that were not envisioned in the original design. In particular, the GPCP data contain approximations that make it difficult for the data to adequately represent fine-scale “extremes”. As well, improved input data sets and algorithms have been developed which are not accommodated in the current version. In response, the GPCP is working under NASA MEaSUREs funding to create a next-generation version at finer scale that is better suited for a wider range of analyses. The widening circle of non-expert users has widened the range of formats and services that are needed. These developments increase the utility of such data sets to users, with the unintended effect that the cost of getting a data set into operation is raised. We find that data archive facilities play a key role in providing these user-oriented services. Community-based standards offer the promise of uniform access to Earth science data, but in the short term we are seeing more diversity in data set presentation and more confusion among users, not less.",

            "abstract": "Pressure cores obtained at the Daini-Atsumi Knoll in the eastern Nankai Trough, the site of the methane hydrate production test completed by the Methane Hydrate Resources in Japan (MH21) project in March 2013, were recovered from ~300 meters beneath the sea floor at close to in situ pressure. Cores were subsequently stored at ~20 MPa and ~5°C, which maintained hydrate in the cores within stability conditions. Pressure core physical properties were measured at 10 MPa and ~6°C, also within the methane hydrate stability field, using the IPTC and other Pressure Core Characterization Tools (PCCTs). Discrete IPTC measurements were carried out in strata ranging from silty sands to clayey silts within the turbidite sequences recovered in the cores. As expected, hydrate saturations were greatest in more permeable coarser-grained layers. Key results include:\n1) Where hydrate saturation exceeded 40% in sandy sediments, the gas hydrate binds sediment grains within the matrix. The pressure core analyses yielded nearly in situ mechanical properties despite the absence of effective stress in the IPTC.\n2) In adjacent fine-grained sediment (hydrate saturation < 15%), hydrate did not significantly bind the sediment. IPTC results in these locations were consistent with the zero effective-stress limit of comparable measurements made in PCCT devices that are designed to restore the specimen’s in situ effective stress.\nIn sand-rich intervals with high gas hydrate saturations, the measured compressional and shear wave velocities suggest that hydrate acts as a homogeneously-distributed, load-bearing member of the bulk sediment. The sands with high gas hydrate saturations were prone to fracturing (brittle failure) during insertion of the cone penetrometer and electrical conductivity probes.\nAuthors would like to express their sincere appreciation to MH21 and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry for permitting this work to be disclosed at the 2014 Fall AGU meeting.",

Here we have tried to establish statistical relationship among Pacific and Indian Ocean Oscillations and MROSSH. Appropriate indices for ENSO, Indian Ocean dipole (IOD), Walker and Hadley circulations have been applied and their connection with MROSSH was investigated.\nAnalysis of APHRODITE data for the period 1979-2007 suggested the great spatial and temporal variation with 9 to 11 years cyclic oscillation, however, no clear trend was observed over the study period. Strong negative correlation is observed between MROSSH and Nino3.4 index (r=-0.50, p<0.01). IOD events have significant impact on MROSSH with countering effect over ENSO. The impact of El Nino (La Nina) on MROSSH is largely reduced by PIOD (NIOD) when composite of co-occurring El Nino-PIOD and La-Nina-NIOD is considered. There was a strong negative association (r=-0.589, p<0.01) between zonal Walker and meridional Hadley circulation. Both of those of tropical circulation were found to be tightly coupled with MROSSH. In particular MROSSH is positively correlated with Walker circulation (r=0.69, p<0.01) and negatively correlated with Hadley circulation (r=-0.632, p<0.01). In summary, the dynamic behavior and inter-annual variability of MROSSH is largely affected by tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean oscillation and associated atmospheric teleconnections.",

            "abstract": "With increasing atmospheric CO2 and climate change, global ocean is undergoing substantial physical and biogeochemical changes. In particular, changes in ocean oxygen and carbonate chemistry have great implication for marine biota. There is considerable uncertainty in the projections of future climate change, and it is unclear how the uncertainty in climate change would affect the projection of ocean oxygen and carbonate chemistry. To examine the effect of climate change on ocean oxygen and carbonate chemistry, we used an Earth system model of intermediate complexity to perform simulations that are driven by atmospheric CO2 concentration pathway of RCP 8.5 with climate sensitivity varying from 0.0°C to 4.5 °C.\nClimate change affects carbonate chemistry and oxygen mainly through its impact on ocean temperature, ocean ventilation, and concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity. Our simulations show that climate change mitigates the decrease of carbonate ions at the ocean surface but has negligible effect on surface ocean pH. Averaged over the whole ocean, climate change acts to decrease oxygen concentration but mitigates the CO2-induced reduction of carbonate ion and pH. In our simulations, by year 2500, every degree increase of climate sensitivity warms the ocean by 0.8 °C and reduces ocean-mean dissolved oxygen concentration by 5.0%. Meanwhile, every degree increase of climate sensitivity buffers CO2-induced reduction in ocean-mean carbonate ion concentration and pH by 3.4% and 0.02 units, respectively. Our study demonstrates different sensitivities of ocean temperature, carbonate chemistry, and oxygen, in terms of both the sign and magnitude, to the amount of climate change, which have great implications for understanding the response of ocean biota to climate change.",

            "abstract": "We tried to model the effect of pore size heterogeneity and pore connectivity on the residue gas saturation for dry gas reservoir rocks. If we consider that snap-off does not exist and only piston displacement takes place in all pores with the same size during imbibition process, in the extreme case, the residue gas saturation will be equal to zero. Thus we can suppose that the residue gas saturation of dry rocks is mainly controlled by the pore size distribution. To verify the assumption, percolation pore networks (i.e., three-dimensional simple cubic (SC) and body-center cubic (BCC)) were used in the study. The connectivity and the pore size distribution in percolation pore network could be changed randomly. The concept of water phase connectivity zw(i.e., water coordination number) and gas phase connectivity zg (i.e., gas coordination number) was introduced here. zw and zg will change during simulation and can be estimated numerically from the results of simulations through gradually saturated networks by water. The Simulation results show that when zg less than or equal to 1.5 during water quasi - static imbibition, the gas will be trapped in rock pores. Network simulation results also shows that the residue gas saturation Srg follows a power law relationship (i.e.,Srg∝σrα, where σr is normalized standard deviation of the pore radius distribution, and exponent α is a function of coordination number). This indicates that the residue gas saturation has no explicit relationship with porosity and permeability as it should have in light of previous study, pore radius distribution is the principal factor in determining the residue gas saturation of dry reservoir rocks.",

Groundwater level and water temperature were hourly measured at the well developed for usage of open loop ground source heat pump system from 11 October 2013 to 8 January 2014. Groundwater was sampled in January and August 2013 and its chemical and isotopic compositions were analyzed. The bedrock of study area is the Jurassic granodiorite that mainly consists of quartz (27.9 to 46.8%), plagioclase (26.0 to 45.5%), and alkali feldspar (9.5 to 18.7%). The groundwater level ranged from 68.30 to 68.94 m (above mean sea level). Recharge rate was estimated using modified watertable fluctuation method and the recharge ratios was 9.1%. The water temperature ranged from 14.8 to 15.0oC. The vertical Increase rates of water temperature were 1.91 to 1.94/100 m. The water temperature showed the significant seasonal variation above 50 m depth, but had constant value below 50 m depth. Therefore, heat energy of the groundwater can be used securely in open loop ground source heat pump system. Electrical conductivity ranged from 120 to 320 µS/cm in dry season and from 133 to 310 µS/cm in wet season. The electrical conductivity gradually decreased with depth. In particular, electrical conductivity in approximately 30 m depth decreased dramatically (287 to 249 µS/cm) in wet season. The groundwater was Ca-HCO3 type. The concentrations of dissolved components did not show the vertically significant variations from 0 to 250 m depth. The δ18O and δD ranged from -9.5 to -9.4‰ and from -69 to -68‰.

The NSF-supported Rolling Deck to Repository (R2R) Program works with the academic fleet community to routinely document, assess, and preserve the underway sensor data from U.S. research vessels. The Ocean Data Interoperability Platform (ODIP) is an EU-US-Australian collaboration fostering interoperability among regional e-infrastructures through workshops and joint prototype development. The need to align terminology between systems is a common challenge across all of the ODIP prototypes. Five R2R students were supported to address aspects of semantic interoperability within ODIP.\nDeveloping a vocabulary matching service that links terms from different vocabularies with similar concept. The service implements Google Refine reconciliation service interface such that users can leverage Google Refine application as a friendly user interface while linking different vocabulary terms.\nDeveloping Resource Description Framework (RDF) resources that map Shipboard Automated Meteorological Oceanographic System (SAMOS) vocabularies to internationally served vocabularies. Each SAMOS vocabulary term (data parameter and quality control flag) will be described as an RDF resource page. These RDF resources allow for enhanced discoverability and retrieval of SAMOS data by enabling data searches based on parameter.\nImproving data retrieval and interoperability by exposing data and mapped vocabularies using Semantic Web technologies. We have collaborated with ODIP participating organizations in order to build a generalized data model that will be used to populate a SPARQL endpoint in order to provide expressive querying over our data files.\nMapping local and regional vocabularies used by R2R to those used by ODIP partners. This work is described more fully in a companion poster.\nMaking published Linked Data Web developer-friendly with a RESTful service. This goal was achieved by defining a proxy layer on top of the existing SPARQL endpoint that 1) translates HTTP requests into SPARQL queries, and 2) renders the returned results as required by the request sender using content negotiation, suffixes and parameters.",

            "abstract": "The 2008 Iwate-Miyagi Nairiku earthquake (M7.2) occurred along a fault in northeastern Japan. The focal area is surrounded with four quaternary volcanoes: Yakeishi, Kurikoma, Onikobe caldera, and Naruko volcano. In a previous study of Okada et al. (2014), they conducted seismic tomography in and around the focal area, and found low velocity zones (LVZ) with high Vp/Vs beneath the volcanoes. They suggest that those LVZs could correspond to areas with over-pressurized fluids, which promoted the occurrence of the earthquake. One of their remaining issues in their study, however, is that a possible LVZ was not clearly found beneath the Naruko volcano, which is located on the south edge of aftershock distribution. In this study, we performed ambient noise tomography in an attempt to identify the possible LVZ beneath Naruko using seismic stations, which are densely deployed in the Naruko volcanic area. After the pre-processing (Bensen et al. 2007) to obtain Rayleigh-wave Green’s function, we measure phase velocity dispersion curves as described in Lin et al. (2008). Then, surface-wave tomography (Barmin et al. 2001) is performed from 0.15 Hz to 0.5 Hz with a frequency step of 0.05 Hz. As a final step, we invert phase velocities for a 1-D Vs model at each grid point by nonlinear inversion(Tarantola and Valette, 1982). The Vs structure shows two LVZs beneath Naruko and Onikobe. The LVZ of Naruko, however, is merged into that of Onikobe at around 4 km depths and is not resolved in deeper crust.",

We analyze the dependence of the shape and location of the ozone distribution on geographic location, emissions and temperature. Depending on these parameters the ozone distribution can be bounded and characterized by a maximum value or it can be unbounded and characterized by a return period. For example, the changes in emissions associated with the EPA SIP call shifts the location of the entire ozone distribution towards lower ozone values and in some locations changes the shape of the distribution from bounded to unbounded. The best methodology to assess ozone extremes is assessed with synthetic ozone distributions.",

            "abstract": "There distributed many relatively isolated seamounts in several inferred seamount chains in west Pacific, and the area has been named as west Pacific seamount province (WPSP). Studying on basaltic rocks from the WPSP will be helpful to better understanding the diversity of plume geodymanics and developing the plume theory. Basaltic lavas from eight seamounts in the WPSP have been studied for petrography, major-, trace element and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic composition. The petrographic characteristics of these rocks show moderately to highly altered. Major element compositions show all of these rocks belong to alkalic series, and some samples lost their alkalis elements during submarine seawater alteration. Primitive mantle normalized spider diagram and chondrite normalized rare earth element distributional pattern show that they were originated from OIB-like source and possibly underwent low degree partial melting. Isotopic characteristics imply that three mantle end-members (DMM, EMI and HIMU) can explain Sr-Nd-Pb compositions of these rocks from the WPSP, i.e., DMM is depleted MORB mantle identical to that being created MORB in EPR, EMI (reprecented by Rarotonga island) is possibly from subducted ancient continental crust, and HIMU (represented by Cook-Austral Islands) is typically originated from recycled oceanic crust. Based on the present study combined with published data, we proposed that the origin of some (maybe all) of seamounts in the WPSP are splash plumes proposed by Davies and Bunge (2006) or smaller plumes branched at the base of lithosphere from the Superwell which has created the Ontong Java plateau.

            "abstract": "Oxygen isotope ratios of ostracode shells (δ18Oostracode) from the central part of Lake Nakaumi, southwest Japan were examined to clarify intensity of East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) in the last 1700 years. Adult whole shell of Bicornucythere bisanensis, which grow into adulthood from April to August in the present Nakaumi, was used for δ18O measurements. Long-term trend in δ18Oostracode correspond with salinity changes in Lake Nakaumi caused by regional geographic events based on analysis of fossil ostracode assemblages. Five short-term increases in δ18Oostracode were recognized in 500, 900, 1350, 1650 and 1850 AD, which correspond with weak periods of the EASM intensity based on δ18O of stalagmite in Wanxiang cave. Intensity of EASM is representative of precipitation around the Japan. For recent ostracodes, δ18Oostracode positively correlated with bottom water salinity, which related negatively to precipitation and positively to δ18O of lake water in the recent Nakaumi. Thus, it might be interpreted that the short-term fluctuations in δ18Oostracode were caused by intensity change of EASM, since δ18Oostracode will increase due to low precipitation during weak periods of EASM. Further, the compiled data demonstrate that at least five EASM weakening periods, in 500, 900, 1350, 1650 and 1850 AD, occurred between 30° and 40° N in East Asia in the last 1700 years. These timings accord with data from sites, which suggests that oscillations of the EASM have been synchronous across the region.",

            "abstract": "Moving from local toward global N2O emissions brings up numerous issues related to data processing, aggregation, tradeoffs between model quality and data quality, and prioritization of data collection and/or compilation efforts. We studied these issues in the context of modelling China’s N2O emissions from agricultural soils. We developed a spatially-explicit model (PKU-N2O-Agr model) for high-resolution mapping of N2O emissions based on the idea of Hole-in-the-Pipe Model. We collected 709 site-year records (504 for upland and 205 for paddy) at 106 experimental sites across China from 1994 to 2013 and calibrated the observed N2O flux by using the Bayesian Recursive Regression Tree algorithm. The calibrated PKU-N2O-Agr model is applied to simulate China’s N2O emissions from upland and paddy cropland at 1-km spatial resolution and to examine the variable importance and sensitivity for N2O emissions as well as scaling dependence of the effect-response relationships. The N2O emissions in 2008 are 615 GgN2O/yr and ~25% lower than PKU-N2O and EDGAR v4.2 global product sampled over China. The average coefficients of determination between observed and simulated results were 0.91 for upland and 0.92 for paddy cropland, which indicate the using a simplified data-driven approach with data of high resolution could produce accurate and reliable results. Emission factors (considering background emissions) for paddy and upland soils are 0.6% and 0.8% of N inputs, which are 2 times of IPCC default but half of the mean of observations, respectively. SOC is the most important for capturing the variability of N2O emissions from upland, whereas N inflow is the critical factor for paddy cropland. Different with previous works, the marginal sensitivities of environmental factors on agricultural N2O emissions are calculated, which is of great use for verifying process-based simulation model when being applied in China (e.g., DNDC). Both critical factors and the effect-response relationships are significantly different under diverse spatial scales, which indicate that the variables and structure of process-based models need to be updated for adapting agricultural N2O simulation at different scales.",

            "abstract": "Birch (Betula) trees and forests are found across much of the temperate and boreal zones of the Northern Hemisphere. Yet, despite being an ecologically-significant genus, it is much less-well studied compared to common genera like Pinus, Picea, Juniperus, Quercus, and Fagus. In the Himalayas, Himalayan birch (Betula utilis) is a widespread, important broadleaf timberline species that survives in mountain rain shadows via access to water from snowmelt. Because precipitation in the Nepalese Himalayas decreases with increasing elevation, we hypothesized that the growth of birch at the upper timberlines between 3,900 and 4,150 m a.s.l. is primarily limited by moisture availability rather than by low temperature. To verify this assumption, a total of 292 increment cores were extracted from 211 birch trees at nine timberline sites. The synchronous occurrence of narrow rings and high inter-series correlations within and among sites evidenced a reliable cross-dating and a common climatic signal in the tree-ring widths variations. From March-May, all nine tree-ring width site chronologies showed a strongly positive response to total precipitation and a less strongly negative response to temperature. During the instrumental meteorological record (after 1960), years with a high percentage of missing rings coincided with pre-monsoon drought events. Periods of below-average growth are in phase with well-known drought events all over monsoon Asia, showing additional evidence that Himalayan birch growth at the upper timberlines is persistently limited by moisture availability. Our study describes the rare case of a drought-induced altitudinal timberline that is composed by a broadleaf tree species.",

            "abstract": "The reactive surface area of primary silicate phases in sediment is an important determinant in weathering rates and fluxes in the critical zone. Weathering rates in warm climates are presumed to be faster than rates in cold climates, but glacial stream systems have chemical fluxes similar to temperate climates due to the production of highly reactive fresh mineral surfaces.\nTo assess climate as a controller on weathering rates by comparing reactive surface area in cold arid and hot arid systems, samples were collected at the base of Denton Glacier, Wright Valley, Antarctica, and in the Anza Borrego Desert, California. Sediments were wet sieved and treated to remove carbonates and organics. Mud and very fine fractions were freeze dried. Surface areas of each size fraction were determined using the BET method. Sediment reactivity was measured through batch dissolution experiments in water buffered to pH 8.4. Samples were removed and filtered at predetermined time intervals, then refrigerated prior to ICP-OES analysis.\nAntarctic glacial sediment released an order of magnitude or more cations to solution compared to alluvial sediments from the Anza Borrego Desert. The Anza Borrego sand fraction was more reactive than the mud for Ca, P, Mn, and Si, while the Antarctic mud was more reactive than the sand for all cations. The high reactivity of the glacial mud can be attributed to the high reactive surface area (10.42 m2/g) created by physical crushing. In addition, the cation exchange capacity of the mud fraction was reached more quickly in the Antarctica samples, while Anza Borrego muds produced more complicated weathering fluxes, likely due to their higher clay mineral component. These results emphasize a strong climate control and the importance of physical weathering mechanisms on the chemical weathering fluxes over geologic time scales.",

            "abstract": "Precursory phenomena including aseismic deformation and foreshock activity have been observed prior to earthquakes. However, whether they will occur prior to the next mainshock remains unsolved. This is critical and essential for the feasibility of earthquake prediction. We investigated more than 100 stick-slip events that occurred on 1.5 m long simulated fault interfaces of gabbro sheared up to 40 mm displacement to reveal temporal relation between premonitory slow slip and its corresponding main slip. We found the onset of the main slip delayed with progressive shear deformation where fault surfaces were roughening and gouge materials were created. For an initially smooth fault without fault gouges the pre-slip is followed immediately by the main slip, while the main-slip was delayed in the case of mature faults with gouges. The time delay to the mainshock varied randomly from nearly zero to half of the recurrence interval of each stick-slip event. We propose that the delay in the onset of mainshock with respect to pre-slip would be common in earthquakes that occurred along mature faults in nature. Considerably delayed earthquakes may explain the apparent lack of pre-slip for some earthquakes. If we could understand the physical mechanism of this time delay, this could lead to provide a short-term indicator of next earthquake.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic spectral analysis, which has often been applied to estimate Curie point depths, was used to delineate thermal and crustal structure of the Atlantic Ocean off Portugal. The Atlantic oceanic plate covers the study area deepening eastward and volcanic islands rise in the eastern margin. We used EMAG2, the resolution and the altitude of which are 2 arc minute and 4 km above geoid, respectively. Linear magnetic anomalies are dominant over the study area. They are attributed to the seafloor spreading of the oceanic plate. The magnetic lineation forms a strong directional feature not only in the space domain but also in the spectral domain. Taking the directional feature, we developed a pseudo-one dimensional spectral analysis using two dimensional data sets. The gradient of the power spectrum across the lineation depends on the centroid depth of magnetic layer. The bottom depth is easily calculated by the centroid and the seafloor depth, assuming that the top of magnetic layer corresponds to the seafloor. The bottom of magnetic layer over young oceanic plate deepens with time, because the Curie point depth deepens with time. Taking the relationship, we assume that the bottom of magnetic layer over the Atlantic oceanic plate corresponds to the Curie point depth and delineates a thermal structure. The results of spectral analysis show that the bottom depths over the oceanic plate are deepening gradually from the ridge to Europe. The results correlate well with magnetic isochrons and thermal history of the oceanic plate. The bottom depths over the volcanic islands are anomalously shallow indicating a rise of high thermal structure.",

            "abstract": "Earth’s cusp proton aurora occurs near the prenoon and is primarily produced by the precipitation of solar energetic (2–10 keV) protons. Cusp auroral precipitation provides a direct source of energy for the high-latitude dayside upper atmosphere, contributing to chemical composition change and global climate variability. Previous studies have indicated that magnetic reconnection allows solar energetic protons to cross the magnetopause and enter the cusp region, producing cusp auroral precipitation. However, energetic protons are easily trapped in the cusp region due to a minimum magnetic field existing there. Hence, the mechanism of cusp proton aurora has remained a significant challenge for tens of years. Based on the\nsatellite data and calculations of diffusion equation, we demonstrate that electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves can yield the trapped\nproton scattering that causes cusp proton aurora. This moves forward a step toward identifying the generation mechanism of cusp proton aurora.",

            "abstract": "The Transantarctic Mountains (TAMs) are a 3500 km long mountain range with peak elevations higher than 4000 m, making them the largest non-compressional mountain range in the world. Yet, little is known about them and their origin since most of the TAMs are ice-covered and geologic data is limited. The TAMs are the dividing feature between old craton in East Antarctica and rifting in West Antarctica, and understanding the origin of the TAMs has important implications for both the tectonic history of Antarctica and non-compressional mountain building processes in general. To investigate the subsurface structure of the TAMs, data from a new 15-station seismic array, the Transantarctic Mountains Northern Network (TAMNNET), as well as data from 4 stations operated by the Korean Polar Research Institute (KOPRI) are being employed. These stations extend from Terra Nova Bay inland about 300 km across the TAMs and into the Wilkes Subglacial Basin. In this study, S-wave receiver functions (SRFs) and Rayleigh wave phase velocities are used to analyze both the TAMNNET and KOPRI data to estimate crustal thickness beneath the study area. Preliminary results indicate a maximum crustal thickness of 47km under the TAMs with an error of ±4km. The average crustal thickness for sites further inland in East Antarctica is 43km. The difference in crustal thickness between these two places lies within error bounds indicating a lack of a crustal root or a root no larger than ~5km. The lack of a crustal root is important in differentiating between origin models that have been proposed to explain the TAMs formation and favor a model where uplift is supported by thermal buoyancy and/or flexural uplift.",

            "abstract": "Correlation detection method is generally used to detect seismic data of electromagnetic seismic vibrator, which is widely applicated for shallow mineral prospecting. By analyzing field seismic data from electromagnetic and hydraulic seismic vibrators in mining area, we find when media underground is complex or the base-plate of vibrator is coupled poorly with ground, there is a 9.30 m positioning precision error and false multiple waves in the electromagnetic vibrator data reference to hydraulic vibrator data. The paper analyzes the theoretical reason of above problems by studying how the signal of electromagnetic vibrator is excited, then proposes a new method of correlation detection based on the reconstructed excitation signal (CDBRES). CDBRES includes following steps. First, it extracts the direct wave signal from seismometer near base-plate of electromagnetic vibrator. Next, it reconstructs the excitation signal according to the extracted direct wave. Then, it detects the seismic data using cross-correlation with the reconstructed excitation signal as a reference. Finally, it uses spectrum whitening to improve detection quality. We simulate with ray-tracing method, and simulation results show that the reconstructed excitation signal is extremely consistence with the ideal excitation signal, the correlation coefficient between them is up to 0.9869. And the signal of electromagnetic vibrator is detected correctly with CDBRES method. Then a field comparison experiment between hydraulic vibrator MiniVib T15000 and electromagnetic vibrator PHVS 500 was carried out near a copper and nickel deposit area. Their output force are 30000N and 300N, respectively. Though there is a great output force difference, the detection result of PHVS 500 using CDBRES method is still consistent with MiniVib T15000.

            "abstract": "Methane production in salt marshes is understudied, although these anaerobic environments store vast amounts of carbon and may release large quantities as climate shifts. Studies show ranges of salt marsh methane emissions that vary widely from 0.4–160 g CH4 m-2 y-1. CH4 production in salt marshes is governed by several variables. Due to high sulfate concentrations in these environments, less CH4 is expected to form and escape from the subsurface. However, vascular plants allow greater amounts of CH4 escape from subsurface porewater and produce more labile organic carbon substrates, which support higher rates of microbial decomposition. Coastal salt marshes are also dominated by various vascular plant species both native and invasive which may allow for greater amounts of CH4 formation and escape than previously thought. To better understand CH4 dynamics in coastal salt marshes, pore water samples were collected from various depths in Piermont salt marsh, NY (40 ̊00’ N, 73 ̊55’W), a tidal wetland that has been invaded in the last century by Phragmites australis. Dissolved organic carbon lability was measured, previously developed isotope-mass balance equations were utilized, and root depth and density were analyzed from several vegetation zones. Areas dominated by invasive Phragmites australis vegetation contain deeper and denser root zones and are expected to produce more subsurface methane and release more methane than areas dominated by native vegetation types. This study will allow us to identify zones more likely to contribute greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and increase knowledge of CH4 production and release in coastal salt marshes.",

            "abstract": "According to the daily runoff data from 17 hydrological stations in Wei River(WR) basin, Huai River(HR) basin and Beijiang(BJ) basin, this paper choose annual runoff coefficient of non-uniformity, concentration period and concentration ratio and their timing features of these three basins to study the change characteristic of runoff in different climate regions of China. Results show that regional difference of annual runoff distribution does not only exist among three basins but also in each station in the same basin. Non-uniformity coefficient of annual runoff distribution in BJ basin is smaller than that in WR and HR basin. Meanwhile, the concentration- period in BJ is earlier than the others. As for the trend of these characteristics, it can be drawn from the computation that the coefficient of non-uniformity appear to decrease in BJ basin while in WR basin, except it’s obviously growing in Linjiacun station, the coefficient doesn’t show obvious trend, so do all the stations in the HR basin. In these basins, the distribution of concentration-period in one year is stable and close to a periodic variation. Mann-Kendall non-parameter statistical test is utilized here to get the variation trend of monthly and annual runoff series. Results show that Wei River basin shows significant reduction trend in annual runoff. The measured runoff data show that the annual runoff reduces weakly in HR although large discrepancy exists among each station. Compared to other 11months, an abnormal trend exists in June in HR basin for its highest MK value. And a more apparent down-ward trend is shown in the north than that in southern basin. As for the BJ basin, it’s obvious that statistics in flood season are higher than in non-flood season, and the trend in northwestern mainstream is more evident than that in southeast. InHR basin, the runoff change characteristic can be verified reasonable by analyzing the similar change features in precipitation. In BJ basin, there is a good correlation between precipitation and runoff, however, no trend exists in precipitation, but runoff series shows a weak rising trend, which indicates the influence from human activities. These finds could help to know the change characteristic of runoff in specific climate region in China more thoroughly.",

            "abstract": "This paper analyzes runoff and soil loss in relation to the rainfall regimes and land use changes in a small mountainous watershed in the Three Gorges Area (TGA) of China. Based on 10 years of rainfall measurements and K-means clustering, 152 rainfall events were classified into three rainfall regimes. The mean statistical features of different rainfall regimes display a marked difference. Rainfall Regime I is events of medium amounts (31.8 mm) and medium duration (1371 min). Rainfall Regime II is events with high amounts (54.0 mm), long duration (2548 min), and an infrequent occurrence. Rainfall Regime III is events of low amount (22.2 mm), short duration (494 min) and high frequency. Each rainfall regime results in differing levels of runoff and erosion and Rainfall Regime I causes the greatest proportion of accumulated discharge (368.7 mm) and soil loss (4283 t). In the different rainfall regimes, the values of the mean runoff coefficient and the mean sediment load were ordered as follows: Rainfall Regime II > Rainfall Regime I > Rainfall Regime III. These results suggest that greater attention should be paid to Rainfall Regimes I and II because they had the most erosive effect. In the Wangjiaqiao watershed, the changes in land use primarily affected the paddy fields, where the cropland decreased significantly and the forest and orchards increased by 9.9% and 7.7%, respectively, during 1995-2004. The ANOVA shows land use changes caused significant decreasing trends in the runoff coefficients (P<0.01) and sediment loads (P<0.01). In order, the most sensitive response of runoff and erosion to land use was Rainfall Regime II > Rainfall Regime > Rainfall Regime III. Rainfall characteristics are decisive for the relative importance of different storm runoff generation mechanisms. The land use changes in the study watershed have considerably decreased runoff and soil loss.",

Besides the analysis fields of CWV, which exhibit spatio-temporal distributions that are quite similar to satellite observations, CWV tendency simulated by forecast models and analysis increment calculated by data assimilation are examined. For JRA-55, it is revealed that, while its forecast model is able to simulate eastward propagation of the CWV anomaly, it tends to weaken the amplitude, and data assimilation process sustains the amplitude. The multi-reanalysis comparison of the analysis increment further reveals that this weakening bias is probably caused by excessively weak cloud-radiative feedback represented by the model. This bias in the feedback strength makes anomalous moisture supply by the vertical advection term in the CWV budget equation too insensitive to precipitation anomaly, resulting in reduction of the amplitude of CWV anomaly. ERA-Interim has a nearly opposite feature; the forecast model represents excessively strong feedback and unrealistically strengthens the amplitude, while the data assimilation weakens it. These results imply the necessity of accurate representation of the cloud-radiative feedback strength for a short-term MJO forecast, and may be evidence to support the argument that this feedback is essential for the existence of MJO. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the multi-reanalysis comparison of the analysis increment will provide useful information for identifying model biases and, potentially, for estimating parameters that are difficult to estimate solely from observation data, such as gross moist stability.",

Therefore, it is essential to understand potential impacts of future events, and the role reinsurance can play to mitigate the losses. The authors will present an overview on natural catastrophe risk assessment modeling in the reinsurance industry, and the development of a new innovative approach for modeling the risk associated with European winter storms.The new innovative approach includes the development of physically meaningful probabilistic (i.e. simulated) events for European winter storm loss assessment. The meteorological hazard component of the new model is based on cyclone and windstorm tracks identified in the 20thCentury Reanalysis data. The knowledge of the evolution of winter storms both in time and space allows the physically meaningful perturbation of historical event properties (e.g. track, intensity, etc.). The perturbation includes a random element but also takes the local climatology and the evolution of the historical event into account.The low-resolution wind footprints taken from the 20thCentury Reanalysis are processed by a statistical-dynamical downscaling to generate high-resolution footprints for both the simulated and historical events. Downscaling transfer functions are generated using ENSEMBLES regional climate model data.\nThe result is a set of reliable probabilistic events representing thousands of years. The event set is then combined with country and site-specific vulnerability functions and detailed market- or client-specific information to compute annual expected losses.",

            "abstract": "The lowermost mantle beneath subduction is typically characterized by higher than average shear wave speeds, often with the presence of one or more D” discontinuities. These regions are considered the cooler parts of the convective cycle, in contrast to warmer zones of convective return flow, namely, the vicinity of large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs). Ultra-low velocity zones (ULVZs) have been long characterized as related to elevated temperature (and/or chemistry) of LLSVP regions. However, some past work has suggested evidence for ULVZ in the presumed cooler regions. In this study we investigate the region beneath the Cocos Plate, Central America, and the Carribbean for ULVZ using high quality broadband Transportable Array data from EarthScope’s USArray for the presence of ULVZs.\nWe utilize an ScS-stripping technique that combines a precursor and postcursor to ScS that arise from ULVZ structure, if present. The precursor is a reflection off the top of the ULVZ, while the postcursor is a core-reflection with an added reverberation between the ULVZ top and the core-mantle boundary (CMB). We collected data from deep South American earthquakes recorded in North America and stack data in geographic bins. We find clear evidence for a ULVZ beneath the Gulf of Mexico, but the rest of the study area appears to lack any significant structure. The structure we find is of the order of 100 km wide. The ULVZ properties will be constrained by comparison to predictions from synthetic seismograms.\nWe explore hypotheses for the origin of a ULVZ in a high shear velocity region. These include mineralogical heterogeneities that convective currents have collected; notable possibilities are accumulated melts from subducted materials, such as ocean crust basalts and banded-iron formation. If water can be transported by subducted slabs to the deep mantle, it can significantly decrease the melting temperature of mantle materials and cause such anomalies. A ULVZ a relatively cold region of the mantle can also be related to products from chemical reactions between the mantle and the core. If ULVZs found in and near LLSVPs are of the same origin as the one found here, then there is the suggestion that convective processes bring material collected outside the LLSVP towards the warmer zones.",

            "abstract": "Subduction zone megathrust faults produce the majority of seismic activity, as well as host a wide range of slip processes, including slow slip events and non-volcanic tremor. In a few regions, such as along the Middle America subduction zone where the Cocos Plate subducts beneath the Caribbean Plate, we are fortunate to have significant long-term seismic and geodetic networks situated above the seismogenic zone. This allows for areas of moment release and geodetic locking to be defined before, during, and after large magnitude earthquakes. These types of long-term observations allow us to explore possible spatial and temporal relationships between slip behavior and geodetic coupling. Here we use the local seismic network data to compute earthquake stress drops using S-wave coda recorded over a period of ~13 years, including for a large set of aftershocks of the 2012 Mw 7.6 earthquake along central Nicoya Peninsula. We use over 1000 earthquakes to test for possible changes in microearthquake behavior after the 2012 Nicoya earthquake, as well as spatial variations that might be linked to variations in mainshock slip and geodetic coupling. Preliminary results, focusing on underthrusting events, suggest spatial stress drop variations that correspond to areas that had significant slip during the mainshock. We also see differences of roughly a factor of 2 in stress drops for aftershocks within the high slip area relative to earthquakes that occurred in that same region within the previous 13 years, suggesting temporal variations as well.

            "abstract": "In the era of Anthropocene, lakes as essential stocks of terrestrial water resources are subject to increasing vulnerability from both climatic variations and human activities. Our recent study reveals a decadal area decline among the largest cluster of freshwater lakes in East Asia, distributed across the Yangtze River Basin downstream of China’s Three Gorges Dam (TGD). The observed lake decline, a cumulative rate of 7.4% (~850 km2) from 2000 to 2011, concurred with enduring meteorological drought, continuous population growth, and extensive human water regulation (e.g., the TGD). The decreasing trend was tested significant in all seasons, leading to an evident phase drop of the average annual lake cycle before and after the TGD operation. The most substantial decline in the post-TGD period appears in fall (1.1% yr-1), which intriguingly coincides with the TGD water storage season. Motivated by such findings, this paper provides a comprehensive diagnosis of the potential TGD impacts on the Yangtze-connected downstream lake system, in comparison to the concurrent contributions from local meteorological variations and human water consumption. Results uncover an altered inundation regime of the downstream lake system induced by TGD’s water regulation, manifested as evident lake area decrease in fall and increase in spring and winter. As the most substantial influence, reduced lake area in fall explains ~20–80% of the observed post-TGD decline. Concurrent Yangtze channel erosion slightly reinforced the area decrease in fall while counteracting ~30% of the area increase in winter. Human water consumption accumulated through the local river network led to constant discharge reduction, which equals another ~80% of the TGD-induced lake decline in fall and completely counteracts the TGD-induced lake area increase in winter. However, human water consumption only adds minor contribution (< 6%) to the post-TGD lake decline due to slow increasing rates during 2000–2011. The major proportions of seasonal post-TGD lake declines were tested to be largely triggered by the decadal climatic drought across the downstream Yangtze Basin; however, the quantified anthropogenic impacts are evident and anticipated to increase in the coming decades due to chronic Yangtze channel erosion and continuous growth of human water demand.",

In cooperation with Geological Survey of Japan, the web-based GIS was developed using Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards. The system is composed of the local databases and the centralized GIS. The local databases created and updated using the centralized GIS are accessible from the portal site. The system introduces distinct advantages over traditional GIS. Those are a global reach, a large number of users, better cross-platform capability, charge free for users, charge free for provider, easy to use, and unified updates.\nRaising transparency of mineral information to mining companies and to the public, AMDIS shows that mineral resources are abundant throughout the ASEAN region; however, there are many datum vacancies. We understand that such problems occur because of insufficient governance of mineral resources.\nMineral governance we refer to is a concept that enforces and maximizes the capacity and systems of government institutions that manages minerals sector. The elements of mineral governance include a) strengthening of information infrastructure facility, b) technological and legal capacities of state-owned mining companies to fully-engage with mining sponsors, c) government-led management of mining projects by supporting the project implementation units, d) government capacity in mineral management such as the control and monitoring of mining operations, and e) facilitation of regional and local development plans and its implementation with the private sector.",

            "abstract": "Accurate estimation of rainfall is critical for any hydrological analysis. The advantage of radar rainfall measurements is their ability to cover large areas. However, the uncertainties in the parameters of the power law, that links reflectivity to rainfall intensity, have to date precluded the widespread use of radars for quantitative rainfall estimates for hydrological studies. There is therefore considerable interest in methods that can combine the strengths of radar and gauge measurements by merging the two data sources. In this work, we propose two new developments to advance this area of research. The first contribution is a non-parametric radar rainfall estimation method (NPZR) which is based on kernel density estimation. Instead of using a traditional Z-R relationship, the NPZR accounts for the uncertainty in the relationship between reflectivity and rainfall intensity. More importantly, this uncertainty can vary for different values of reflectivity. The NPZR method reduces the Mean Square Error (MSE) of the estimated rainfall by 16 % compared to a traditionally fitted Z-R relation. Rainfall estimates are improved at 90% of the gauge locations when the method is applied to the densely gauged Sydney Terrey Hills radar region. A copula based spatial interpolation method (SIR) is used to estimate rainfall from gauge observations at the radar pixel locations. The gauge-based SIR estimates have low uncertainty in areas with good gauge density, whilst the NPZR method provides more reliable rainfall estimates than the SIR method, particularly in the areas of low gauge density. The second contribution of the work is to merge the radar rainfall field with spatially interpolated gauge rainfall estimates. The two rainfall fields are combined using a temporally and spatially varying weighting scheme that can account for the strengths of each method. The weight for each time period at each location is calculated based on the expected estimation error of each method, leading to a dynamic weighting scheme. The weighted combination method reduces the MSE by close to 50% compared to a traditional power law method for using the radar reflectivity. The combined method has the lowest overall error of the three methods over the densely gauged Sydney region.",

            "abstract": "The Poison Lake chain (PLC), located the Lassen region of the Southern Cascades, encompasses six geochemical, lithological and geographically distinct groups of primitive basalts, defined as MgO >6%, Ni >100 ppm, and Cr >200 ppm. In total, 22 cinder cones and flows of the PLC erupted in a small area (<30 km2) over a very short time frame (100 ka +/- 10 ka). The diversity of primitive compositions in the small spatial and temporal scales provide an ideal area in which to explore variations in mantle compositions that produce primitive basalts in the Lassen Segment of the Cascade Arc. We present major, trace, and isotope data and spinel-olivine compositions that reveal the diversity of mantle domains present in this small area. Chromium compositions of spinel in primitive basalts of the PLC indicate the presence of three distinct mantle sources: (1) depleted with Cr# = 0.44-0.52; (2) enriched with Cr# = 0.2-0.3 and (3) an intermediate composition, with Cr# = 0.4. Major and trace element compositions of PLC primitive basalts confirm the relative differences in depletion and reveal distinctions in the depth of melt generation. REE patterns and trace element ratios indicate variability in the presence of garnet in the source and define the source regions with varying depth. These mantle domains are geographically distributed with depleted compositions (high Cr# spinel, lower incompatible elements) in the northwest part of the PLC, grading to more enriched compositions (low Cr# spinel and higher incompatible elements) in the southeast. Previous workers recognize variations in the Cascadian sub-arc mantle at large scales across and along the arc, and at the scale of individual volcanic centers. However, the small area (30km2) and short timescale (within 10 ka) represented by the primitive basalts of the PLC allow us to hold time and space relatively constant while examining geochemical variations. Using primitive mantle proxy basalts from the PLC, we suggest that mantle in the Lassen region, and potentially elsewhere in similar arcs, may be as small as tens of kilometers - a new measure for the scale at which mantle variations can occur.",

            "abstract": "Although it is clear that delta topset surfaces can maintain an average long-term parity between subsidence and sedimentation, the ways in which subsidence information is transmitted to the fluvial system and its effects on the rivers remain unresolved. Here we argue that the direct, local effect of subsidence on river systems is transmitted through spatial gradients in subsidence, and that the overall spatial mean subsidence communicates only indirectly with the river system, through its effect on relative sea level. With this idea in mind, we first express the local spatial variation of subsidence by taking the (vector) gradient of the local (scalar) subsidence rate expressed as a downward speed. This vector field represents the rate and maximum direction of rotation induced by subsidence gradients. We then compare this rotation-vector field to the surface-slope field, and decompose the subsidence-induced surface rotation into slope-normal and slope-parallel components. The slope-normal component is associated with lateral steering of the river channels, tending to direct them towards areas of maximum subsidence. The slope-parallel component acts directly to induce local erosion and deposition by changing the surface slope. The effect of the slope-normal component is also modulated by floodplain deposition and other out-of-channel effects. We apply these ideas to experimental data and to the Holocene Ganges-Brahmaputra-Jamuna (GBJ) Delta, Bangladesh, and compare the resulting predictions to stratigraphic and other observations.",

Differing from external a priori information, the self-extracted information are generally parameters derived exclusively from the analysis of the gravity and magnetic data (Paoletti et al., 2013). Here we develop a new self-constrained inversion method based on probability tomography. Probability tomography doesn’t need any priori information, as well as large inversion matrix operations. Moreover, its result can describe the sources, especially the distribution of which is complex and irregular, entirely and clearly. Therefore, we attempt to use the a priori information extracted from the probability tomography results to constrain the inversion for physical properties.\nThe magnetic anomaly data was taken as an example in this work. The probability tomography result of magnetic total field anomaly(ΔΤ) shows a smoother distribution than the anomalous source and cannot display the source edges exactly. However, the gradients of ΔΤ are with higher resolution than ΔΤ in their own direction, and this characteristic is also presented in their probability tomography results. So we use some rules to combine the probability tomography results of ∂ΔΤ⁄∂x, ∂ΔΤ⁄∂y and ∂ΔΤ⁄∂z into a new result which is used for extracting a priori information, and then incorporate the information into the model objective function as spatial weighting functions to invert the final magnetic susceptibility.\nSome magnetic synthetic examples incorporated with and without a priori information extracted from the probability tomography results were made to do comparison, results of which show that the former are more concentrated and with higher resolution of the source body edges. This method is finally applied in an iron mine in China with field measured ΔΤ data and performs well.\n",

Thus ground surface temperature history can be reconstructed from borehole temperature measurements using borehole paleothermometry inversion method. In this study, we use seven borehole temperature profiles to reconstruct the ground surface temperature variation of the past 500 years of the Qaidam basin, northwestern China. Borehole transient temperature measurement from seven sites in northwestern Qaidam basin were separated from geothermal gradients and analyzed by functional space inversion method to determine past ground surface temperature variations in this region. All temperature profiles show the effects of recent climatic disturbances. Inversion shows an overall increase in ground surface temperature by an averaged 1.2℃ (-0.11~2.21℃) during the last 500 years. Clear signs of a cold period between 1500 and 1900 A.D., corresponding to the Little Ice Age, have been found. Its coldest period was between 1780~1790 A.D. with the ground surface temperature of 5.4℃. During the 19th and the 20th century, reconstructed ground surface temperature shows a rising trend, and in the late 20th century, the temperature started to decrease. However, the highest temperature in 1990s broke the record of the past 500 years. This reconstructed past ground surface temperature variation is verified by the simulated annual surface air temperature computed by EdGCM and the cooling trend is also confirmed by other reconstruction of winter half year minimum temperatures using tree rings on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau.",

            "abstract": "The El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), ENSO Modoki and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) have distinct impacts on the climate variation of the Indian Ocean rim countries. The Indian summer monsoon rainfall is seen to be positively influenced by the positive phase of the IOD and in recent decades it could reduce the effects arising from concurrent El Nino events of the Pacific. Unlike the positive influences on the summer rainfall arising from the positive IOD events, a proportionate opposite relationship is not observed for some of the negative IOD events, for example, the events of 2005 and 2013. The teleconnections arising from negative IODs to East Asia, particularly associated with La Ninas, appear somewhat similar to that of positive IOD events. This non-linearity stems from the complex interactions among the phenomena of the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans; such as the phases of IOD and ENSO, and their concurrences. Also, the unique land-sea distribution in the Indian Ocean and associated stronger than normal atmospheric convections over India and surrounding seas contribute to this non-linearity.\nThe Southeast Asian monsoon is on the other hand seen to be influenced by tropical and extra tropical climate variations. ENSO and ENSO Modoki usually dominate the rainfall variability during spring and fall seasons. However, regional monsoon and extratropical climate modes influence the rainfall variations during summer and winter seasons, respectively. While the associated monsoon variability, which mostly arises in the Indian Ocean, is easier to understand and predict, the associated extratropical climate variations in winter (such as the Siberian and High and Aleutian Low) are difficult to comprehend and predict owing to their non-linear interactions with other modes of climate variations.",

For smaller ice crystals halo broadening is predicted, and there is appreciable \"spillover'\" of the halo into shadow scattering angles <22 degrees. Ways to retrieve ice crystal sizes are suggested based on the full width at half-maximum of the halo, the power at <22deg, and the halo polarization. The 22 halo like feature is predicted for size parameter as low as x=100, but with an angular structure very different from the halo calculated using geometric optics.",

            "abstract": "Self-potential is a non-invasive, passive geophysical technique with applications ranging from imaging oil and gas reservoirs to identifying preferential flow paths in earthen embankments. Several cross-coupled flow phenomena contribute to self-potential data, and there is a need to further quantify these various sources to enable better resolution and quantification of self-potential models. Very little research has been done to constrain thermoelectric source mechanisms that contribute to self-potential signals. A laboratory experiment has been designed to investigate the thermoelectric coupling coefficient (CTE) that relates the voltage change per degree centigrade (V/°C) in porous media. This study focuses on a sand tank experiment using a saturated silica sand. To isolate the temperature gradient dependence of self-potential measurements, no hydraulic gradient is applied to the tank, eliminating the streaming potential component of source current. Self-potential and temperature data are recorded while reservoirs of hot and cold water are established on opposite ends of the tank in order to generate thermoelectric source currents. Various thermal gradients ranging from 0 °C to 80 °C over 20 cm are examined for various salinities (10-3M- 1M NaCl), sand grain sizes and clay content to investigate influences on CTE. A short-duration contact of non-polarizing (Pb/PbCl) electrodes is implemented to minimize temperature drift of electrodes during the experiment. Surface self-potential and temperature measurements are made in 30 minute intervals. Initial measurements have revealed non-linear effects, including a decreased CTE as temperature gradient bounds approach 0 °C.",

            "abstract": "The Tatun volcanic area is the only potential volcanic geothermal region in the Taiwan island, and abundant in hot spring resources owing to stream water mixing with fumarolic gases. According to the Meinzer’s classification, spring temperatures and discharge rates are the most important properties for characterizing spring classifications. This study attempted to spatially characterize spring temperatures and discharge rates in the Tatun volcanic area, Taiwanusing indicator kriging (IK). First, data on spring temperatures and discharge rates, which were collected from surveyed data of the Taipei City Government, were divided into high, moderate and low categories according to spring classification criteria, and the various categories were regarded as estimation thresholds. Then, IK was adopted to model occurrence probabilities of specified temperatures and discharge rates in springs, and to determine their classifications based on estimated probabilities. Finally, nine combinations were obtained from the classifications of temperatures and discharge rates in springs. Moreover, the combinations and features of spring water were spatially quantified according to seven sub-zones of spring utilization. A suitable and sustainable development strategy of the spring area was proposed in each sub-zone based on probability-based combinations and features of spring water.The research results reveal that the probability-based classifications using IK provide an excellent insight in exploring the uncertainty of spatial features in springs, and can provide Taiwanese government administrators with detailed information on sustainable spring utilization and conservation in the overexploited spring tourism areas. The sub-zones BT (Beitou), RXY (Rd. Xingyi), ZSL (Zhongshanlou) and LSK (Lengshuikeng) with high or moderate discharge rates are suitable to supply spring water for tourism hotels.Local natural hot springs should be planned in the sub-zones DBT (Dingbeitou), ZSL, XYK (Xiayoukeng), and MC (Macao) with low discharge rates, and low or moderate temperatures, particularly in riverbeds or valleys.\nKeywords: Spring; Temperature; Discharge rate; Indicator kriging; Uncertainty",

            "abstract": "Of the 17 million km^2 of sea ice in the Southern Ocean, ~10% is generated through coastal polynyal systems. The largest and greatest contributor to sea ice formation in the Antarctic is the Ross Sea Polynya which exists in a region where sea ice trends are positive and significant. Understanding polynya areal dynamics and the contributing physical factors will give further insight into the future of Ross Sea ice production. Previous studies have established coastal winds and surface temperatures as key contributors to the development and maintenance of coastal polynyas. However, much that is understood is based on physically sound inference. While the influence of these variables have been studied separately, their concerted roles have not been quantified, neither has any indication of their variation with time been established. Automatic weather station data produced by the Antarctic Automatic Weather Station Program was acquired from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and polynya area data was produced through the application of the Polynya Signature Simulation Method onto Special Sensor Microwave Imager input acquired from the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Wind speed, wind direction, sea surface temperature, near surface air temperature, oceanic temperature, and tidal fluctuations are examined as physically significant contributors to polynya areal variability and are considered in a multivariate regression model at a 95% confidence level. This study quantifies the degree to which each variable contributes to Ross Sea Polynya areal dynamics, and determines how their influences vary seasonally and in the long term.",

To support efforts to reduce air pollution, the European Union is supporting the PANDA project whose objective is to use space and surface observations of chemical species as well as advanced meteorological and chemical models to analyze and predict air quality in China. The Project involves 7 European and 7 Chinese groups. The paper will describe the objectives of the project and present some first accomplishments. The project focuses on the improvement of methods for monitoring air quality from combined space and in-situ observations, the development of a comprehensive prediction system that makes use of these observations, the elaboration of indicators for air quality in support of policies, and the development of toolboxes for the dissemination of information.",

            "abstract": "The 2004 Mw9.3 Sumatra earthquake initiated a large, sustained groundwater eruption in Guangdong, China, 3200 km away from the epicenter. The erupted water column reached a height of ~60 m above the ground surface when it was first sighted and the eruption lasted about 10 days. Estimated seismic energy density at the eruption site is only 0.046 J.m-3; thus it is surprising that the earthquake caused such an intense response. A field survey showed that a large amount of gaseous CO2 was released from groundwater during the eruption and suggested that the eruption was caused by the exsolution of CO2 from groundwater. In this study, we use numerical simulation to explore the mechanism of the well eruption. We apply tidal analysis to water level data from 2003 to 2006 to estimate the aquifer parameters before and after the earthquake; the hydraulic diffusivity inferred this way is 0.423 m2/s and 1.371 m2/s before and after the earthquake, respectively. Based on these parameters, we use TOUGH2, a widely used numerical program for simulating two-phase hydrothermal processes, to simulate the evolution of CO2 saturation, the velocity of erupted groundwater and pressure in the well-aquifer system after Sumatra earthquake. The simulations show that the earthquake may have triggered bubbles to nucleate from the CO2-rich groundwater and enhanced the aquifer permeability, leading to increased groundwater discharge to the well. Decreased pore-pressure in the aquifer caused greater exsolution of CO2 and greater discharge, leading to groundwater eruption. Exsolution of CO2 extends radially away from the wellbore as a function of time and the continued exsolution of CO2 sustained the eruption until pressure in the aquifer drops below hydrostatic, which is marked by a ~9 m drop in groundwater level from that before the earthquake. That earthquake trigger eruption and CO2 exsolution has implications for CO2 sequestration.",

            "abstract": "Measurements of spatially-variable gravity at the field scale are difficult; measurements of the time-varying field even more so. Every previous gravity survey using relative gravimeters—still the workhorse of gravity studies, despite their nearly 80 year history—has assumed a static gravity field during the course of a survey, which may last days to weeks. With recently-improved instrumentation, however, measurements of fields changing on the order of tens of nm/sec2 per day are now possible. In particular, the A-10 portable absolute gravimeter provides not only absolute control, but also the change in that control during the course of a survey. Using digitally-recording spring-based relative gravimeters (namely, the ZLS Burris meter and the Scintrex CG-5), with their more efficient data collection and lower drift than previous generations, many more data are collected in a day. We demonstrate a method for incorporating in the least-squares network adjustment of relative gravity data a relation between the rate of change of gravity, dg, and distance from an infiltration source, x. This relation accounts for the fact that gravity at stations adjacent to the infiltration source changes more rapidly than stations further away; if all measurements collected over several days are to be included in a single network-adjustment, consideration of this change is required. Two methods are used to simulate the dg(x) relation: a simple model where dg is a linear function of x, and a coupled-hydrogeophysical method where a groundwater flow model predicts the nonlinear spatial variation of dg. Then, the change in gravity between different, independently adjusted surveys is used to parameterize the groundwater model. Data from two recent field examples, an artificial recharge facility near Tucson, Arizona, USA, and from the 2014 Lower Colorado River pulse flow experiment, clearly show the need to account for gravity change during a survey; maximum rates of change for the two studies were up to 30 and 50 nm/sec2 per day, respectively.",

            "abstract": "The deliquescence and heterogeneous ice nucleation behavior of simulated sea-spray aerosol was probed from 215 to 235 K using Raman microscopy coupled to an environmental cell. Water uptake prior to deliquescence was also probed on sea-salt particles along deliquescence/ice nucleation experimental trajectories. Synthetic sea-salt particles were generated from solutions of aquarium salt, which emulates all major and minor ions that are found in saltwater. Our results indicate that, under cirrus cloud conditions, sea-salt particles will be in an internally mixed liquid-solid phase, with a brine layer surrounding a crystalline core. Above 230 K, the core of the internally mixed liquid-solid particle fully deliquesces prior to ice nucleation. Below 225 K, however, the crystalline core can act as efficient immersion-mode ice nuclei prior to full liquefaction. To simulate the presence of carbohydrate-like organics in sea spray aerosol, sea-salt particles were mixed with the disaccharide sucrose 1:1 by mass. At low relative humidity, the sea-salt particles effloresced into an amorphous organic-salt matrix. Above 225 K, sea-salt/sucrose particles fully deliquesce prior to ice nucleation; however, at lower temperatures, the organic-salt matrix was found to be glassy and could act as an efficient depositional ice nucleus. This work suggests the possible role of sea-salt aerosol in low-temperature ice nucleation. Consistent with this, data from aircraft campaigns suggests sea-salt aerosol is enhanced in ice residuals from low-temperature anvil cirrus whose convective inflow regions are primarily marine environments.",

            "abstract": "Deformation of the Earth’s upper crust is localized onto narrow fault zones, which may slip suddenly and catastrophically in earthquakes. Strain in the upper mantle is more broadly distributed and is thought to occur by continuous ductile creep. The properties of the lower crust are the primary control on the behavior of the coupled system during the earthquake loading cycle. However, the distribution of strain in the lower crust is poorly understood.\nHere we show that the North Anatolian Fault (NAF) continues as a narrow structure through most of the crust. We use scattering migration from an 18 month deployment of 73 broadband seismometers in a dense array (~7 km spacing) across the NAF in the location of the 1999 Izmit earthquake rupture. The results reveal clear discontinuities in the lower crust across the northern and southern branches of the NAF, which extend to a depth of at least 25 km. Seismicity, by contrast, is confined to the upper ~15 km.\nDeformation on the fault was well recorded both before and after the 1999 earthquakes. Prior to the earthquake, strain was focused in a ~50 km region around the fault. Following the earthquake, a rapid post-seismic transient was observed, which slowly decayed over the subsequent decade. Earthquake cycle models require at least two relaxation time constants to explain these observations – a strong material to allow focused interseismic strain, and a material capable of relaxing quickly, to give rapid postseismic deformation. We present two models capable of reproducing these observations – (i) a visco-elastic model in which the weak material is found in a zone beneath the seismogenic fault, and (ii) a model in which postseismic deformation occurs through afterslip on a deep extension of the seismogenic fault plane. The latter appears more consistent with the seismic images. We also present results from geological analogues of the mid-lower crust beneath the NAF, which are also consistent with the idea that strain is focused in narrow shear zones in the lower crust beneath major faults.",

In addition, two cruises in the northeastern ECS in July 2011 and in Tsushima Strait in July 2012 were conducted to evaluate the distribution patterns of these isotopes over the entire Changjiang transport pathway. In summer, the surface δ13C was lowest in the Changjiang Channel, increasing from land to sea, reaching highest values in the central ECS, and then decreasing and remaining relatively constant. In winter, the surface δ13C in the western ECS showed lower values with less variation in general. At most stations, δ13C increased from the sea surface to the seabed, reflecting the degradation of sinking organic matter; however, these trends could be changed in the summer by surface phytoplankton accumulation. Combining data from all the Changjiang Estuary and western ECS cruises revealed that when the suspended particulate matter (SPM) was > 135 mg/L, the δ13C values were fairly constant (–24.5‰ to –20.5‰); when the SPM was < 135 mg/L, the δ13C values showed much greater variability (–28.4‰ to –16.6‰). The surface δ15N also showed generally higher values in the central ECS in summer and lower values in winter. The seasonal variations of δ13C and δ15N were largely attributed to the SPM composition change: i.e., more phytoplankton cells in the summer whereas more resuspended sediment particles were present in winter.",

Although both of the interannual variations of NECBL and MD show significant correlations with El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), there are still some inconsistent variabilities in some years that can not be explained by ENSO. The East Asia Monsoon (EAM) has important impact on the interannual and longer time scale variations of the MD, whose relationship with ENSO is modulated by Pacific Decadal Oscilation (PDO). The inconsistent variations of the NECBL and MD with ENSO can be explained by the variation of EAM. As connected through the Mindanao Current (MC) and the North Equatorial Current (NEC), variations of MD are closely related to the NECBL both on seasonal and interannual time scales. Mean while, the non-ENSO eddy parameters and the non-ENSO NECBL at the interannual time scale are identified based on the altimeter data analyses. It is suggested that the NECBL perturbed northward by CE and southward by AE, which is evidenced by experiments using a quasi-geostrophic ocean model.",

Originally designed as a mission planning tool for the Constellation Program, LMMP has grown into a generalized suite of tools facilitating a wide range of activities in support of lunar exploration including public outreach, education, lunar mission planning and scientific research.\nLMMP fosters outreach, education, and exploration of the Moon by educators, students, amateur astronomers, and the general public. These efforts are enhanced by Moon Tours, LMMP’s mobile application, which makes LMMP’s information accessible to people of all ages, putting opportunities for real lunar exploration in the palms of their hands.\nOur talk will include an overview of LMMP and a demonstration of its technologies (web portals, mobile apps), to show how it serves NASA data as commodities for use by advanced visualization facilities (e.g., planetariums) and how it contributes to improving teaching and learning, increasing scientific literacy of the general public, and enriching STEM efforts.\n",

            "abstract": "The Indian summer monsoon (ISM) is a vast interhemispheric climate system, transporting large amount of moisture and heat across the equator from the southern Indian Ocean to the Asian continent. Considerable debate exists whether northern or southern hemisphere climate processes are the dominant drivers of ISM variability on millennium and orbital times scales. We present a high-resolution speleothem oxygen isotope record of ISM from Bittoo cave (BT) in northern India (30°47N, 77°46E, 3000 masl) for the last 280,000 years. Observations and model simulations show that the δ18O of precipitation in this region is inversely correlated with the ISM intensity. The BT δ18O record is characterized by large amplitude fluctuations on both orbital and millennial timescales with notably abrupt δ18O jumps to extremely light/heavy values commonly occurring at the rising and declining limbs of NHSI, respectively. The orbital-scale variations in ISM intensity track Northern Hemisphere Summer Insolation (NHSI) without notable temporal lags, consistent with the East Asian Monsoon (EAM) variability as documented from Chinese speleothem records. The well-dated MIS 3 and MIS 5 portions in the BT δ18O record show no phase difference with their counterparts in EAM speleothem records, suggesting in-phase variability at precession bands. Prominent millennial-scale events in the BT δ18O record correlate with millennial events in the Greenland ice core and EAM speleothem records rather than Antarctic ice core records, thus demonstrating a strong link between NH high latitude climate and low latitude monsoonal climate. A detailed comparison of the BT record with both Antarctic ice core records and sea surface temperature records does not appear to confirm a dominant role of Southern Hemisphere on the ISM through the postulated increased cross-equatorial pressure gradient.",

            "abstract": "Solidification or melting at the inner core boundary, the phenomena that have been suggested to occur reflecting the dynamical processes either of the inner core or of the outer core, might cause a Fe-rich or Fe-poor layer in the lowermost outer core (F-layer). Such a compositional anomaly might be detectable by investigating fine seismic structure of the F-layer. In our previous study we determined the overall Vp structure near the inner core boundary beneath Antarctica using differential traveltimes between PKIKP and PKPbc, waveform modeling of PKIKP and PKiKP, and amplitude ratios between PKIKP and PKPbc. But the fine structure of the F-layer remained poorly constrained.\nIn this presentation, we examined the Vp structure of the F-layer beneath the eastern Pacific using differential traveltimes between PKiKP and PKPbc as well as frequency dependence of differential traveltimes between PKIKP and PKPbc, because these two analyses are particularly sensitive to the F-layer structure. We analyzed broadband seismograms of South American earthquakes observed at HI-NET in Japan. The differential traveltime residuals (observed minus calculated) between PKiKP and PKPbc are sensitive to the Vp excess relative to the reference model that is summed over the F-layer below the turning depth of PKPbc. For between 147 and 150 degrees the observed differential residuals show larger negative values and no noticeable dependence on distance compared to that for AK135. PREM that has larger Vp values in the F-layer than AK135 gives smaller differentials than the observations. On the other hand frequency dependence of differential traveltimes between PKIKP and PKPbc has unique sensitivity to the Vp slope in the F-layer, and low sensitivity to the Vp value on the ICB. We measured differential traveltimes for two different frequency bands for between 150 and 157 degrees, and then calculated the difference of the differentials between the two frequency bands. The observed differences show the dependence on epicentral distance. Calculated dependence of the difference for AK135 is gentler than the observation, suggesting that the Vp slope in the F-layer is steeper than that of AK135.\nThese two results suggest that Vp in the F-layer beneath the eastern Pacific lies between those of AK135 and PREM, and that the Vp slope is steeper than that of AK135.",

            "abstract": "The northwest part of India (NWI) known as the “wheat bowl” of the country, receives 40% - 45% of its annual precipitation during winter season. This precipitation is very important for the wheat crop, as it supplements the moisture and maintains low temperature during the reproductive stages. Most of the winter precipitation in the region is in the form of snowfall over western Himalayas. This precipitation, in turn, helps in maintaining the glaciers, which serve as the vast storehouse of freshwater supply to millions of people downstream throughout the year through rivers of western Himalayan origin. Therefore, for a country like India that gets more than 80% of its wheat production and fresh water from NWI region, the question arises whether strategies of winter-time precipitation prediction that have proved useful elsewhere can be adapted to the exceptionally complex terrain of Himalayas as well?\nIt has been found that present day coupled general circulation models (GCMs) provide seasonal-scale prediction in advance, however this prediction is in coarse resolution and skill is not satisfactory even with multi-model ensemble techniques. Thus, it is necessary to reproduce the information of the GCMs at higher resolution with improved skill using downscaling approaches. Therefore ultimate goal of the present study is to use output of the GCMs without statistical correction, and apply this output to regional climate model in a way that allows realistic simulation of precipitation and temperature over NWI. In particular we discuss (a) requirement for assessing the fidelity of the coupled general circulation models, (b) the role of various idealized experiments (for e.g. cumulus schemes, resolution, orography and land surface change) and (c) development of novel statistical downscaling technique for seasonal-scale prediction over NWI. We also highlight the benefits and current issues associated with the proposed \"explicit\" approach.",

            "abstract": "The amount and geographic distribution of N2O emissions over China remain largely uncertain. Most of existing emission inventories use uniform emission factors (EFs) and the associated parameters and apply spatial proxies to downscale national or provincial data, resulting in the introduction of spatial bias. In this study, county-level and 0.1° × 0.1° gridded anthropogenic N2O emission inventories for China (PKU-N2O) in 2008 are developed based on high-resolution activity data and regional EFs and parameters. These new estimates are compared with estimates from EDGAR v4.2, GAINS-China, National Development and Reform Commission of China (NDRC), and with two sensitivity tests: one that uses high-resolution activity data but the default IPCC methodology (S1) and the other that uses regional EFs and parameters but starts from coarser-resolution activity data. The total N2O emissions are 2150 GgN2O/yr (interquartile range from 1174 to 2787 GgN2O/yr). Agriculture contributes 64% of the total, followed by energy (17%), indirect emissions (12%), wastes (5%), industry (2.8%), and wildfires (0.2%). Our national emission total is 17% greater than that of the EDGAR v4.2 global product sampled over China and is also greater than the GAINS-China, NDRC, and S1 estimates by 10%, 50%, and 17%, respectively. We also found that using uniform EFs and parameters or starting from national/provincial data causes systematic spatial biases compared to PKU-N2O. In addition, the considerable differences between the relative contributions of the six sectors across the six Agro-Climate Zones primarily reflect the different distributions of industrial activities and land use. Eastern China (8.7% area of China) is the largest contributor of N2O emissions and accounts for nearly 25% of the total. Spatial analysis also shows nonlinear relationships between N2O emission intensities and urbanization. Per-capita and per-GDP N2O emissions increase gradually with an increase in the urban population fraction from 0.3 to 0.9 among 2884 counties, and N2O emission density increases with urban expansion. Moreover, additional experiments and the use of a reliable data-driven approach or process-based models can improve the spatial resolution and reduce the uncertainties in PKU-N2O, especially from agricultural soils and manure management.",

Here we use geodetic observations including GPS and InSAR to characterize the 1989 Mw 6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake postseismic displacement from 1989.8 to 2013. Pre-earthquake deformation rates are constrained by nearly 20 years of USGS trilateration measurements and removed from the postseismic measurements prior to the analysis. We observe 1-4 mm/yr GPS horizontal displacement toward the Loma Prieta epicenter until 2000, and ~2 mm/yr surface subsidence of the northern Santa Cruz Mountains between 1992 and 2002, which is not associated with the seasonal and longer-term hydrological deformation in the adjoining Santa Clara Valley. Previous work indicates afterslip dominated in the early (1989-1994) postseismic period, so we focus on modeling the postseismic viscoelastic relaxation between 1994 and 2010 based on geodetic observations. The best fitting result predicts an 11-km-thick viscoelastic lower crust with viscosity of about 1019 Pa s below a 19-km-thick elastic upper crust, underlain by a bi-viscous upper mantle with transient viscosity of 1016.5-17.5 and steady-state viscosity of 1017.5-18.5 Pa s. The millimeter scale postseismic deformation does not resolve the viscosity in different layers very well, but the inferred lithospheric rheology is consistent with estimates in southern California. The viscoelastic relaxation may also contribute to the enduring increase of aseismic slip and repeating earthquake activity on the San Andreas Fault near San Juan Bautista, which continued for at least a decade after the Loma Prieta event.",

            "abstract": "Characteristics of root-zone soil moisture spectra in a subtropical monsoon forest in Thailand (Mae Moh) and two warm-temperate forests in the US (Duke) and Japan (Seto) were examined for time scales ranging from 30 minutes to multiple years. These forested areas have comparable maximum leaf area index but markedly different phase relations between evapotranspiration, net radiation, precipitation, and soil moisture. A hierarchy of models that sequentially introduce the spectrum of precipitation, net radiation, and nonlinearites in the damping originating from stomatal controls and drainage losses were used. If the precipitation is random, and the damping term by evapotranspiration and drainage is increased linearly with increasing soil moisture, the temporal variability of soil moisture simplifies to a first order Markov process commonly employed in the analysis of soil moisture in climate models. Its spectrum exhibits a Lorentz function with a white-noise behavior at low frequency and red-noise behavior at high frequency separated by a time-scale constant for intermediate frequencies. Such first order Markov process model with its time scale defined by the maximum wet surface evapotranspiration, soil porosity, and root-zone depth did not represent the observed soil moisture spectra at all three sites. Adding the effect of precipitation and net radiation variability were necessary for representing the actual soil moisture spectra. While the observed soil moisture spectra were satisfactorily reproduced by these additions, the relative importance of precipitation and net radiation to the soil moisture spectra differed between sites. The soil moisture memory, inferred from the observed soil moisture spectra (model decay time scale), was about 25-38 days, which was larger than that determined from maximum wet evapotranspiration and available pore space alone, except that these two time scales in Seto forest were nearly the same.",

            "abstract": "Across many soil types and conditions, soil internal drainage exhibits predictable dynamics that converge to a stable hydration state termed “field capacity” (FC). Notwithstanding the usefulness of this natural state as a hydrologic benchmark for modeling and for estimation of plant available soil water, FC had been fraught with ambiguities and inconsistencies since its inception. We propose using a soil intrinsic characteristic length (derived from drainable soil pore size distribution) to mark conditions for loss of hydraulic continuity linked with attainment of FC. This static criterion for FC was extended to define a general and self-consistent dynamic criterion for internal drainage dynamics. A systematic evaluation of the proposed FC definitions using a numerical model and experimental data reveals remarkable consistency and predictability across a wide range of soil types. The new intrinsic metrics provide the necessary definitiveness for this useful concept relevant to a broad range of agronomic, hydrologic, ecological and climatic applications. The consistency of FC hydration state must have played an important role in shaping life in soil not only in terms of plant available water, but also in the aquatic habitats it defines for soil biota.

            "abstract": "Heat transport properties such as thermal conductivity, heat capacity, and thermal diffusivity are significant parameters that influence on geothermal process in sedimentary basins at depth. We measured the thermal properties of sediment core samples at off-Shimokita basin obtained from the IODP Expedition 337 and Expedition CK06-06 in D/V Chikyu shakedown cruise. Overall, thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity increased with depth and heat capacity decreased with depth, although the data was highly scattered at the depth of approximately 2000 meters below sea floor, where coal-layers were formed. The increase of thermal conductivity is mainly explained by the porosity reduction of sediment by the consolidation during sedimentation. The highly variation of the thermal conductivity at the same core section is probably caused by the various lithological rocks formed at the same section. Coal shows the lowest thermal conductivity of 0.4 Wm-1K-1, and the calcite cemented sandstone/siltstone shows highest conductivity around 3 Wm-1K-1. The thermal diffusivity and heat capacity are influenced by the porosity and lithological contrast as well. The relationship between thermal conductivity and porosity in this site is well explained by the mixed-law model of Maxwell or geometric mean.\nOne dimensional temperature-depth profile at Site C0020 in Expedition 337 estimated from measured physical properties and radiative heat production data shows regression of thermal gradient with depth. Surface heat flow value was evaluated as 29~30 mWm-2, and the value is consistent with the heat flow data near this site. Our results suggest that increase of thermal conductivity with depth significantly controls on temperature profile at depth of basin. If we assume constant thermal conductivity or constant geothermal gradient, we might overestimate temperature at depth, which might cause big error to predict the heat transport or hydrocarbon formation in deepwater sedimentary basins.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake faults are complicated and hard to access experimentally. To complement field studies, laboratory and numerical models that focus on the universal features of natural earthquakes are extremely valuable. We have developed a laboratory experiment that includes sheared elastic plates separated by a narrow gap filled with a quasi-two-dimensional granular material. Local measurement of strain displacements of the plates at over 400 spatial points located adjacent to the gap allows direct determination of the moments and their spatial and temporal distributions. We show that events consist of laterally coherent, larger motions that we label as “brittle” events and spatially distributed, smaller “non-brittle” events. The non-brittle events have a probability distribution of event moment consistent with an $M^{-3/2}$ power law scaling and a Poisson distributed recurrence time distribution. Brittle events have a broad, log-normal moment distribution and a mean repetition time. As the applied normal force increases, there are fractionally more (less) brittle (non-brittle) events, and the brittle moment distribution broadens. The magnitude of the slip motion of the plates is well correlated with the RMS displacements of the granular matter. Our results are consistent with mean field descriptions of statistical models of earthquakes and avalanches.",

            "abstract": "Precipitation intercepted by forests plays a major role in the hydrologic cycle for more than one fourth of the global land area. Direct in situ measurement of intercepted precipitation is a challenging task. We discuss and compare measurement methods for forest precipitation interception beyond classical budgeting methods, with an emphasis on estimating the critical water storage component for rain and snow, then recommend future directions for the improvement of water storage estimation and monitoring.\nComparison of techniques estimating water storage shows that methods submerging tree components produce the largest storage capacity values. Indirect methods typically result in the lowest water storage estimates. Whole tree lysimeters have been used with great success, yet are unable to separate trunk vs. canopy storage components. Remote sensing technologies, particularly signal attenuation, may permit this separation. Mechanical displacement methods show great promise and, perhaps as a result, have the greatest variety of techniques. Relating wind sway to canopy water storage via accelerometers also shows great promise, yet is in the proof-of-concept stage at present.\nRecommended future directions for forest water storage estimation are, to (1) apply these methods individually under different conditions to identify further strengths/weaknesses, (2) apply methods in tandem to identify complimentary strengths and limitations, (3) improve scaling techniques for element- and tree-specific techniques, (4) increase temporal monitoring resolution to capture intrastorm processes that may drive interception loss, and (5) foster synergies between communities developing methodologies for specific precipitation types as differing methods often rely on similar underlying measurement principles. Through addressing these research needs, we hope the scientific community can develop an “integrated” monitoring plan incorporating multiple measurement techniques to characterize forest-scale water storage dynamics while simultaneously being able to investigate underlying components driving those dynamics across the spectrum of precipitation and forest conditions.",

            "abstract": "Large outburst floods on Earth and Mars have carved bedrock canyons in basalt that often have steep sidewalls and amphitheater heads, suggesting erosion by waterfall retreat and block toppling. Two paleohydraulic methods are typically used to reconstruct flood discharges. The first is based on the discharge required to move sediment, which requires rare grain-size data and is necessarily a lower bound. The second assumes bedrock canyons are entirely inundated, which likely greatly overestimates the discharge of canyon carving floods. Here we explore a third hypothesis that canyon width is an indicator of flood discharge. For example, we expect that for large floods relative to the canyon width, the canyon will tend to widen as water spills over and erodes the canyon sidewalls. In contrast, small floods, relative to the canyon size will tend to focus flow into the canyon head, resulting in a narrowing canyon. To test this hypothesis, we need data on how outburst floods focus water into canyons across a wide range of canyon and flood sizes. To fill this data gap, we performed a series of numerical simulations solving the 2D depth-averaged shallow water equations for turbulent flow. We analyzed the effect of five non-dimensional parameters on the shear stress and discharge distributions around head and sidewalls of canyons of different sizes. The Froude number of the flood has the greatest effect on the distribution of shear stresses and discharges around the canyon rim; higher Froude numbers lead to less convergence of the flow towards the canyon, and thus to lower shear stresses (and discharges) on the sides of the canyon. Simulation results show that canyons of constant width were likely carved by floods within a relatively narrow range of discharges. The range of discharges is sensitive to the Froude number and size of blocks that are toppled at the canyon head, both of which can be estimated from field and remotely sensed data. Example applications on Earth and Mars show that our flood reconstructions yield canyon-carving discharges larger than inferred from incipient motion thresholds, and often dramatically smaller than inferred from assuming complete canyon inundation.",

            "abstract": "We present tomographic images of the compressional (Vp) and shear (Vs) wave velocity structure of the upper crust beneath the Endeavour segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge. This ridge segment is bounded by the Endeavour and Cobb overlapping spreading centers (OSCs) to the north and south, respectively. Near the segment center an axial magma chamber (AMC) reflector underlies 5 hydrothermal vent fields. Our analysis uses data from the Endeavour tomography (ETOMO) experiment. A prior study of the Vp structure indicates that the shallow crust of the Endeavour segment is strongly heterogeneous [Weekly et al., 2014]. Beneath the OSCs Vp is anomalously low, indicating tectonic fracturing. Near the segment center, upper crustal Vp is relatively high beneath the hydrothermal vent fields, likely due to infilling of porosity by mineral precipitation. Lower velocities are observed immediately above the AMC, reflecting increased fracturing or higher temperatures. Anisotropic tomography reveals large amplitude ridge-parallel seismic anisotropy on-axis (>10%), but decreases in the off-axis direction over 5-10 km. Here we use crustal S-wave phases (Sg) — generated by P-to-S conversions near the seafloor — to better constrain crustal properties. Over half the OBSs in the ETOMO experiment recorded horizontal data on two channels that are of sufficiently high quality that we can orient the geophones using the polarizations of water waves from shots within 12 km. For these OBSs, crustal Sg phases are commonly visible out to ranges of ~20-25 km. We invert the Sg data separately for Vs structure, and also jointly invert Pg and Sg data to constrain the Vp/Vs ratio. Preliminary inversions indicate that Vs and Vp/Vs varies both laterally and vertically. These results imply strong lateral variations in both the physical (e.g., crack density and aspect ratio) and chemical (e.g., hydration) properties of oceanic crust.",

            "abstract": "Since the subduction zone is one of the most geologically active regions in the world, it has attracted much attention from the various fields of the earth science. In this presentation, we try to combine the results and knowledge of seismic tomography, geodynamic modeling and the geologic history of the subduction zone around the Japanese Islands to constrain the nature of the subduction zone there. For this purpose, first, we estimate the cold temperature anomaly by converting the fast velocity anomaly of GAP_P4 model [Fukao & Obayashi, 2013] to the cold temperature anomaly using the recent estimate of d(ln Vp)/dT by Karato [2008]. The magnitude of the anomaly is constrained by the work on the relation between the theoretical estimate of temperature and the seismicity in the subducting slab [Emmerson & McKenzie, 2007]. We find that, although the velocity anomaly itself does not show a significant high velocity anomaly just below the stagnated slab, the estimated temperature shows rather continuous cold anomaly from the upper to the lower mantle. This continuous feature is consistent with the recent results of geodynamic modeling of the subduction zone. However, we still see a significant thinning or an absence of the slab just below the stagnated slab in the transition zone. This is more evident in other tomographic models. Geodynamical modeling of subduction, especially, the stagnation of the slab in the transition zone shows that the slab behavior strongly depends on the geological settings of subduction zone such as the rollback of trench. To understand the present feature of the slab revealed by the seismic tomography, we construct a simple half-kinematic model of subduction zone by taking into account the geological settings, that is, the opening of the Japan Sea. We find that the slab similar to the present image is obtained in terms of disruption of the slab suggesting that it occurred during the opening of the Japan Sea.",

Here, we examine this issue in China, a region with intensive and long-lasting human influence. We employ modern datasets for human influence index (HII), climate and pollen over continental China to develop quantitative calibration models for HII and two key climate variables (annual precipitation, PANN; annual mean temperature, TANN). We assess the effect of HII on modern pollen assemblages and individual pollen taxa by comparison with climate variables by using constrained ordination methods and boosted regression trees and apply the calibration models to a pollen record spanning the last 6200 years from Lake Tianchi in central China. The results show that HII has smaller influence on the modern pollen data than PANN and TANN, except for in east-central China where the relationship between pollen data and HII is both statistically and ecologically significant. The reconstructed HII from Lake Tianchi remains relatively stable at 6200–2900 cal. yr BP, rises gradually at 2900–1100 cal. yr BP, and increases abruptly 1100 years ago. These HII trends are roughly concordant with Holocene charcoal and historical population records. The climate reconstructions change in tune with the HII, with an abrupt decline of PANN and a rise of TANN after 1100 cal. yr BP. Other palaeoclimatic data contradict the reconstructed patterns of PANN and TANN during the last millennium, suggesting that the climate reconstructions over the last 11 centuries are seriously biased due to the marked increase of human influence. Such a bias likely exists in other pollen-based climate reconstructions from other regions with strong and long-lasting human influence on vegetation.",

            "abstract": "Cryotubated horizons of permafrost soils contain as much as 410 Pg C, a significant proportion of which may be vulnerable to climate changes through permafrost thawing and subsequent decomposition by soil microorganisms. While numerous studies have addressed temperature and soil moisture controls, very little is known on energy and nutrient constraints of microbial decomposition in permafrost soils.\nWe investigated nutrient and carbon limitations of permafrost soils by analysing a wide range of soil samples for C:N stoichiometry and carbon isotope composition and incubating soil samples of different depths with carbon only or carbon and nitrogen amendments.\nUtilising the carbon isotopic composition of soil organic matter (SOM) as a proxy for the stage of decomposition, we identified a breakpoint of about 1.5% C, below which decomposition was dominated by the recycling of microbial biomass, and above which decomposition of plant derived material was the main process. This breakpoint corresponds to a threshold element ration (TERC:N) between 15-20. Soils with a C:N ratio below the TERC:N (i.e., soil that can be considered as C or energy limited) make up for a significant proportion of the overall SOM stored in permafrost soils, even in the active layer.\nTo get more insight into the limitations of SOM decomposition, we incubated about 100 soil samples from 4 sites across Siberia with either cellulose or cellulose and protein for 180 days and calculated how the amendments affected the decomposition of native SOM. All incubated horizons, regardless of their depth or C:N ratio showed a significant increase in native SOM decomposition to a combined carbon and nitrogen amendment, that was higher than with C amendment alone. We conclude that nutrient and carbon limitations of soil microbial communities constitute important constraints on SOM decomposition and should be incorporated into models predicting future permafrost carbon storage.",

            "abstract": "It has been a longstanding challenge in the last few decades to quantitatively reconstruct the paleogeographic evolution of East Eurasia because of its great tectonic complexities. As the core region, the major China cratons including North China Block, South China Block and Tarim Block hold the key clues for the understanding of the amalgamation history, tectonic activities and biological affinity among the component blocks and terranes in East Eurasia. Compared with the major Gondwana and Laurentia plates, however, the apparent polar wander paths of China are not well constrained due to the outdated paleomagnetic database and relatively loose pole selection process. With the recruitment of the new high-fidelity poles published in the last decade, the rejection of the low quality data and the strict implementation of Voo’s grading scheme, we build an updated paleomagnetic database for the three blocks from which three types of apparent polar wander paths (APWP) are computed. Version 1 running mean paths are constructed during the pole selection and compared with those from the previous publications. Version 2 running mean and spline paths with different sliding time windows are computed from the thoroughly examined poles to find the optimal paths with the steady trend, reasonable speed for the polar drift and plate rotation. The spline paths are recommended for the plate reconstructions, however, considering the poor data coverage during certain periods. Our new China APWPs, together with the latest European reference path, the geological, geochronological and biological evidence from the studied Asian plates allow us to reevaluate the paleogeographic and tectonic history of East Eurasia.",

Our approach is to change the background diffusion coefficient from a constant value\nκ\nb\nto\nκ\nb\n+δκ(z)\nin various subregions of the tropical Pacific, and then to determine the resulting temperature changes in the near-equilibrium response. In a companion paper (Furue et al., 2014, submitted), we consider the impacts of depth-independent\nκ\nb\nanomalies. Here, we examine the impacts of depth-dependent anomalies that are confined above, or centered on, the mid-depth of the pycnocline.\nDuring the first year of adjustment, solutions develop a local temperature response that results largely from the one-dimensional balance,\nδ\nT\nt\n=(δκ\nT\nz\n)\nz\n=δ\nκ\nz\nT\nz\n+δκ\nT\nzz\n, with a similar equation for salinity. At this stage,\nδκ\ngenerates temperature and salinity anomalies that are either associated with a density change (dynamical anomalies) or without one (spiciness anomalies). Subsequently, dynamical and spiciness anomalies spread to remote regions by wave radiation and advection, respectively.\nFor positive\nδκ\nanomalies confined above the mid-pycnocline,\nδ\nκ\nz\nT\nz\n(\nδκ\nT\nzz\n) tends to produce positive (negative) temperature anomalies, which spread to the equator dynamically (by wave radiation) and are still apparent in near-equilibrium solutions. For\nδκ\nanomalies confined within the pycnocline (with monopole, dipole, and tripole profiles), the response is dominated by\nδ\nκ\nz\nT\nz\n, owing to\nδκ\nhaving a smaller vertical scale than\nT\nand to\nδκ\nnot overlapping well with\nT\nzz\n; the resulting temperature anomalies tend to shift the pycnocline vertically (dipole profile) or to alter its thickness (monopole and tripole profiles).\nPositive anomalies from all subregions contribute to an increase of near-surface (upper 50 m) temperature in the EEPO, the amplitude and location of the warming depending on the depth range of the warming band generated within the locally forced subregion.",

Around the same time, movements which poor peoples or landless peasants settle into abandoned land have been very active in Brazil. In many cases, these people lack agricultural experiences to yield sufficient production for livelihoods. Thus, it leads to abandon the land and repeat forest clearance. In recent year, education by NGOs to these people encourage spreading of agroforestry which is a land use management system in which trees are grown around or among crops or pasture land. In this study, we specifically aimed at clarifying changes in LULC and these biomass using ground observation data, remotely-sensed LANDSAT data and GIS techniques. We focus on four different settlements: old-established settlement (around 30 years), established settlement (around 20 years), productive settlement (7 year) and unproductive settlement (7 years). These four settelements were located at Santa Barbará province, about 40 km northeast from the center of Belém, the Pará state capital, in the northern part of Brazil. We clarify that the biomass change varied according to whether the settlement are productive or not.",

            "abstract": "Many Proterozoic anorthosite massifs show crustal isotopic signatures that have fuelled debate regarding the source (mantle vs. lower crust) of these temporally restricted magmas. The models advocating a mantle derivation for these rocks suggest that lower crustal assimilation plays an important role in developing the isotopic signature of the massifs, but no evidence exists to support this. We make use of Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic compositions of anorthosites from the Mealy Mountains Intrusive Suite (MMIS), the Nain Plutonic Suite (NPS) and the Rogaland Anorthosite Province (RAP), their internal mineral phases and comagmatic, high-pressure pyroxene megacrysts, which represent samples from various stages of the polybaric ascent of the magmas, to probe the origin of the crustal isotopic signatures and assess the importance of differentiation at lower crustal depths. Study of the MMIS and NPS is instructive as each is intruded into crust of significantly different age and isotopic composition. We observe varying degrees of internal isotopic disequilibrium, enforcing the notion that the nature of the crustal assimilant has a profound influence on the chemical signature of the magmas (Fig. 1). We also find unexpected patterns of internal isotopic disequilibrium, such as isotopically depleted orthopyroxene relative to plagioclase (Fig. 1), which suggests that anorthosite petrogenesis is not a “simple” case of progressive crustal contamination during polybaric magma ascent, but is more likely to involve significant differentiation and solidification at lower crust depths. The 100 m.y. magmatic timescales observed in these anorthosite systems may be caused by significant magmatic differentiation at Moho/lower crustal levels, as well as formation in long-lived arc environments. These long-lived magmatic timescales contrast with recent observations suggesting that the duration of magma ascent from the Moho to surface in arc environments is on the order of months to years. Such contrasting timescales for magmatism hint at non-uniformitarian processes at work in the subduction regime (favoring anorthosite production) during the Proterozoic Eon and/or suggests that there may be a continuum of magma ascent rates in arcs with anorthosite ascent rates representing the slowest end of the spectrum.",

The fracture zone associated with fault zone could be considered as a fluid reservoir, which possibly yield to some observations/detections of phenomena associated with pre-, co- or post-seismic of a larger earthquake. Several observations had been made recently to investigate the temporal variation of the attenuation within the hanging wall before, following and after the earthquake, e.g. 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake, and 2004 Parkfield earthquake. The study associated with the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake observed a temporal changes with a diffusion process in Qs by the deduction of about 90 within the fault rupture zone two years following the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake. The reduction in Qs two years following the Chi-Chi earthquake might indicate high pore-fluid saturation within fractured fault zone rocks due to post-seismic redistribution of the fluid. In this study, we will try to further quantify the observation by considering the conservation theory of the fluid flux within the reservoir and the passage of fluid flux through the fault zones after a large earthquake to examine the possible association of the fluid to the reduction of Qs. This theoretical attempt would provide also the possible basis in understanding the fluid behavior in the fault zone associated with earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Progressive climate shifts are particularly pronounced in the Polar Regions, including glacial fjords and bays. Many different tools are now widely used to investigate the rate of glaciers’ movement, intensity of calving events and subglacial freshwater outflows or changes in an ice concentration at the sea surface. However, harsh polar conditions make the most of them difficult to conduct and temporal and spatial resolution is often unsatisfactory. Therefore, there is a growing need to develop new methods for quantifying glacier processes. Recently, the application of passive marine acoustics has proved to be promising in this field. Here measurements of ambient noise field directionality made during summer 2013 and spring 2014 in different locations in the Hornsund Fjord, Spitsbergen are presented and discussed. Field data were collected from an inflatable boat using floating buoy equipped with two omnidirectional broadband hydrophones mounted on a horizontal axis, tilt sensor and magnetic compass. A few hours of recordings were analyzed and time differences of arrivals were calculated to obtain directions to the sound sources. The results not only confirm previous observations that underwater sounds in the Hornsund fjord propagates from various directions in distinct spectral bands. They primarily reveal that determined arrival angles together with calculated noise spectral intensity may provide valuable information about the activity of individual glaciers and the distribution of melting glacial ice across the Arctic fjord. Thereby, the applicability of ambient noise oceanography in the study of tidewater glaciers is clearly shown.

The samples were compressed at 300 K in a diamond anvil cell to a maximum pressure of 15.2(1) GPa with a neon pressure-transmitting medium and a gold pressure calibrant. We observed a recently described orthorhombic to triclinic transition, as well as a further transition to a second triclinic phase. We solved and refined both new triclinic phases in space group P1, and designate them cordierite II and III. The structures of cordierite II and III were refined at 7.52(2) GPa at 15.2(1) GPa, respectively. The lattice parameters at these pressures are a = 15.567(2) Å, b = 9.6235(4) Å, c = 9.0659(5) Å, α = 89.963(5)°, β = 86.25(1)°, and γ = 90.974(8)° for cordierite II, and a = 8.519(2) Å, b = 8.2448(3) Å, c = 9.1627(4) Å, α = 85.672(4)°, β = 85.986(7)°, and γ = 70.84(1)° for cordierite III. Across the phase transitions there is a significant reduction in the length of the a­-axis (~2 Å per phase transition), whereas both the b­- and c-axis remain largely unchanged. Cordierite II has four- and five-coordinated Si and Al, while cordierite III has four-, five-, and six-coordinated Si, four- and five-coordinated Al, and five- and six-coordinated Mg. The sequence of high-pressure phases shows increasing polymerization of coordination polyhedra. These results, together with other recent studies, suggest that mixed 4-, 5-, and 6-fold coordination states may occur more commonly in silicate structures compressed at 300 K than previously recognized.",

Organic matter breakdown may also release reactive forms of nitrogen, which may significantly impact ecosystem processes. We currently have limited understanding of where in Arctic landscapes breakdown of organic materials will occur, or whether this will influence the strength and direction of feedback loops that may occur in response to changes in C and N cycling. In this work, we studied changes in dissolved forms of C and N in water moving down a hillslope linking upland terrestrial environments to lowland floodplains within the Kolyma River watershed in the East Siberian Arctic tundra in July, 2014. The hill slope consisted of a mosaic of dry and saturated soils, generally with drier soils on the periphery and saturated soils in and around pools or short reaches of flowing surface water. We established transects at regular intervals downslope, installing wells in the center of the flow path and 5 meters laterally north and south. We analyzed pore-water from wells and surface water from pools at each transect for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN). We used patterns in water chemistry to develop a conceptual model for biogeochemical changes as water moved downslope through soils, pools and runs. Pore-water analysis showed significantly higher DOC in lateral wells than in surface water and pore water in the center of the flow path, suggesting possible processing of C as water moves laterally towards the valley bottom. In contrast, DOC increased modestly down the center of the flow path, suggesting either higher hydrologic inputs or production of new DOC downslope. TDN concentration decreased downslope, suggesting processing by microbes or uptake by grasses which dominated the valley bottom. Together these patterns suggest N limitated microbial processes or plant production, which may increase organic C export to downstream ecosystems. If general, this pattern would have significant implications for future climate feedbacks from C released as permafrost thaws.",

Vertically, overpressure distribution is not direct ly related to the burial depth, it is mainly controlled by stratigraphic horizons, especially the lower Tertiary Anjihaihe Formation has the most evident control over the overpressures. Horizontally, overpressure occur in the 3 structural belts in southern edge of the basin, but there are differences in the east and in the west : in the eastern part overpressures occur in the Anjihaihe Formation only, while in the western part, they occur not only in the Anjihaihe Formation, but also in the Shawan and Ziniguanzi Formation. Analyzing the relationship between the well test data and overpressures in the southern edge of Junggar basin, it can be found that the distribution of oil and gas reservoirs are closely related to the overpressures. Being affected by faulting, and due to the differences in mechanism of relationship between overpressures and preservation of oil and gas reservoirs, the distribution of overpressures and oil and gas reservoirs cannot be corresponding to one another. As a whole, however, oil and gas would be ready to be reservoired in the normally pressured zone below the moderately abnormal pressured or overpressures zone, which would, therefore, be the favorable target of petroleum exploration; while the overpressured zone with relatively high formation pressure coefficient is unfavorable for oil/ gas reservoiring.",

            "abstract": "Ferrimagnetic iron oxides are the key magnetic minerals responsible for enhancement of the magnetic susceptibility in soils. Soils with andic properties contain high amount of Fe-oxides, but only few attempts were made to characterize these soils using magnetic methods. Magnetic susceptibility is in particular suitable for its sensitivity and fast measurement; the presence of Fe-oxides can be easily identified directly in the field. The aim of our study is to describe main magnetic and geochemical properties of soils rich in Fe oxides derived from strongly magnetic volcanic basement.\nThe studied sites are located at the basalt parent rock formed during Pleistocene, Pliocene and Miocene. Investigated soils are exposed to the mountainous climate with the perudic soil moisture regime and cryic temperature soil regime. Seven basalt soil profiles with typical andic properties were analyzed down to parent rock by a set of magnetic and geochemical methods. The magnetic susceptibility was measured in situ and in laboratory using the Bartington MS2D and AGICO MFK1. Its temperature dependence was measured in order to assess phase transformations of magnetic minerals using the KLY4. Magnetic data were completed by the hysteresis, IRM and DCD measurements using ADE EV9 VSM. Geochemical data include soil reaction (pH), organic carbon, cations exchange capacity, and extractable iron and aluminium in the soil extracted by a dithionite-citrate, acid-ammonium oxalate and a pyrophosphate solution. Scanning electron microscopy was done for top/sub-soil and rock samples.\nGeochemical soil properties reflecting iron oxide stability correlate well with mass-specific magnetic susceptibility. Well pronounced relationship was observed between magnetic grain size, precipitation and soil pH, second group is reflecting concentration of feri-magnetic particles and age of parent rock, and the third group reflects degree of weathering and the thermomagnetic indices expressing changes in magneto-mineralogy along the soil profiles. Influence of the weathering processes on all the measured parameters is discussed. Soil genesis is influenced by several factors, where the moisture is more important than the age of the parent material.\nAcknowledgement: This study was supported by Czech Science Foundation through grant No 13-10775S.",

With disparate philosophies and different but insufficient inputs, most of the existing models are capable of generating satisfying outputs, which reveals a relatively robust idiosyncrasy of hydrological pattern over monthly time scale. This research uses the epistemic-aleatory uncertainties evaluation framework to examine the information source sink terms and flows of 6 conceptual monthly water balance models and a seasonal autoregressive stochastic hydrologic model over 19 basins in Jiangxi Province, China and the experiment basins of MOPEX project. By using the stream technique of Lisp, we constructed two programming paradigms into which the hydrological models mentioned above could be fitted. We focus on detecting and explaining the best achievable predictive performances and data-revealed insufficient of the models in each paradigm, especially the hydrological meaning of the iteration variables in these models. Finally, we make an attempt to compare and connect these two paradigms against the backdrop of algorithmic information theory to help us form a better understanding of monthly hydrological pattern.",

            "abstract": "Marsh and his colleagues have been pioneers in linking of fluid mechanical templates with the chemistry and petrologic constraints in magmatic systems. Such interplay becomes particularly important during the assembly and growth of magma bodies of intermediate composition where thermal and chemical gradients are frequently reset due to recharge and mixing. The resulting boundary layers and their dynamics remain poorly understood given the complex interplay of interface kinetics, phase equilibria and heat and mass transfer in those environments. The multitude of parameters makes this problem commonly intractable. Therefore, we have devised diffusion couple experiments to investigate specifically the kinetic petrologic phenomena associated with magma recharge and mafic enclave formation.\nMagma-magma diffusion couples were run by using natural andesite and dacite to synthesize, at 150 MPa and fO2 ~FMQ+3, two initial glass compositions: 1) andesite with ~1 wt. % H2O, ~700 ppm S, ~500 ppm Cl at 1030°C; and 2) dacite with ~3 wt. % H2O, ~100 ppm S, ~1500 ppm Cl at 900°C. The diffusion-couples were run at 950°C and 1000°C, 150 MPa, and FMQ+3, for 0.1 to 100 h. At 950°C and 1000°C the andesite crystallized significantly at the interface between the two magmas, and became volatile saturated within the solidification front. EPMA traverses across the interface and x-ray maps indicate the mass transfer by diffusion in the melt, however, delayed as a consequence of transient crystallization and subsequent dissolution as the magmas work their way towards equilibrium. Mineral dissolution fronts can be tracked for clinopyroxenes, olivines and plagioclase with decreasing extent into the andesite. These results provide a temporal and spatial framework for one important aspect of magma mixing, the formation mafic enclave as well as their slow destruction.",

            "abstract": "In the Late Miocene progressive restriction of the gateway(s) between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean initiated the Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC). The restriction caused a salinity rise and the formation of extremely thick evaporite deposits within the Mediterranean basin. Subsequently, the closure of the connection between the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean resulted in a dramatic sea level drop.\nThe lithosphere adepts to changes in loads (sediments and water) on the surface by flexural adjustment of the Earth's surface. This can have a significant impact on the connectivity of basins and the temporal evolution of the sea level drop in each basin. The Mediterranean Sea is characterized by two deep basins with different amounts of river input (western/eastern Mediterranean basin) separated by the relatively shallow Sicily sill. The temporal evolution of the sea level drop in the western/eastern Mediterranean basin is therefore very sensitive to the temporal and spatial evolution of the Sicily gateway and hence flexure response of the earth surface due to the changes in waterload. However, studies of the MSC sea level drop haven't taken this flexural response into consideration (e.g. Meijer and Krijgsman, 2005).\nHere we use an elastic model (TISC) coupled with a simple hydrology model to calculate the temporal evolution of the sea level drop in and the flexural response of the western and eastern Mediterranean basins. Preliminary results show that when sea level drops below the Sicily sill, the rate of sea level increases in the western but decreases in the eastern Mediterranean. Following a relative sea level drop of ~1300 m, resulting in a flexural uplift of ~700m, the eastern Mediterranean reaches equilibrium. At the time the western Mediterranean (flexural uplift of ~900m) reaches an equilibrium it is almost completely desiccated. The magnitudes of the sea level drops and flexural response are, however, highly dependent on the hypsometry, fresh water budgets, and strength of the lithosphere.",

A rapid exhumation rate of about 6 mm/yr over the past several million years has been determined by many previous thermochronological studies in the eastern flank of the Central Range. However, the uplift mechanism of the Central Range is still in debate. Especially, the most important structural component, the Central Range Fault in the eastern boundary of the Central Range, has never been clearly observed in the previous studies. An east-vergent “backthrusting” or “backfolding” was firstly proposed by Ernst in 1977. However, normal faulting and oblique faulting with a normal component were also proposed by the following field workers (e.g., Crespi et al., 1996; Fisher, 1999). In this study, we use the geomorphic, stratigraphic, and structural analyses to figure out the near surface geometry of the Central Range Fault, and as well use the recent earthquake data to understand the deeper structures beneath the Central Range. By combining these results, we propose a doubly vergent model with a roll-back Central Range fault to explain the local structure and the rapid uplift of the eastern flank of the Central Range.",

It is often difficult to discriminate the contribution of Primary and Secondary Aerosol formed at the sea-air interface from background level of the aerosol. We therefore decided to study the sea-air exchanges in a controlled environment provided by a 2m3simulation chamber, using freshly collected sea-water samples from the SEMEX site (43°15’64 N, 05°20’01 E) near Marseille bay.\nTwo types of experiments were conducted for 4 weeks testing 3 different sea-waters. Primary sea-aerosol was generated by bubble-bursting method, then introduced in the simulation chamber and exposed to atmospheric oxidants (O3, OH) and light to simulated primary aerosol aging. A second set of experiments focused on secondary particle formation upon illumination and/or ozone exposure of the sea-water surface (15l of sea-water were deposited in a pyrex container located inside the simulation chamber). New particle formation was only observed for relatively high DOC level of the sea-water sample.\nParticles detection and analysis was followed by a PSM (1nm size), a CPC (2.5nm size), a SMPS (granulometry), a CCN chamber for hygroscopicity studies, a TOF-AMS (Aerodyne) for chemical analysis of the sub-micrometer fraction. Off-line analysis included TEM-EDX samples for morphology and size distribution studies and a hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fischer) for the molecular identification of the organic fraction. VOCs were measured on-line by PTR-HR-MS.\nThe seawater samples were filtered at 60µm before use and were daily analyzed for chemical (colored dissolved organic matter, particulate matter and related polar compounds, transparent polysaccharides and nutrients concentration) and biological (chlorophyll a, virus, phytoplankton and zooplankton) analyses.",

The SCS is a marginal sea of the western Pacific and has undergone a near complete Wilson cycle from continental breakup to seafloor spreading to subduction along the Manila Trench. Two of the primary objectives of Expedition 349 are to determine the initiation and termination age of seafloor spreading through direct sampling of oceanic crust and to elucidate the cause of differences in seafloor magnetic anomalies between the East and Southwest Subbains. Expedition 349 drilled five sites in the deep basin of the SCS. Sites U1431, U1433, and U1434 recovered oceanic basement and overlying sediments near fossil spreading centers, and Sites U1432 and U1435 recovered materials near or at the northern continent/ocean boundary. Preliminary paleomagnetic results show that sediments and basement rocks from the sites drilled by Expedition 349 contain both reversely and normally magnetized samples. Our paleomagnetic study involves detailed alternating field and thermal demagnetization analysis of discrete samples. Stable characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) components are observed throughout the studied cores, following removal of a low stability drilling-induced remanence. Inclination values of ChRM are moderate downward or upward, consistent with the expected inclination for the sites. In order to examine the origin of the ChRM, supportive rock magnetic experiments on the same samples used for magnetostratigraphy of the drill sites were also conducted. Preliminary shipboard interpretations of biostratigraphic data from these sites indicate that the fossils needed to anchor the magnetostratigraphy are available. Preliminary magnetostratigraphy for Expedition 349 sites should help to refine the ages of sedimentation events and tectonic activities within and beyond the South China Sea basin.",

            "abstract": "The transition from the warmer Allerød to the cooler Younger Dryas period is well understood to represent sudden and extreme climate changes during the end of the last glaciation. Thus, lake sediment studies within paleoclimatic and paleoecological research on this transition are ideal to enhance the knowledge about “lead and lags” of lake system responses to abrupt climate changes through applying multi-proxy sediment analyses.\nIn this study, we present the results of high-resolution studies on varved late glacial sediments from the Trzechowskie paleolake, located in the northern Poland (center Europe).\nHigh-resolution bio-proxies (pollen, macrofossils, Cladocera and diatoms), geochemical analyses (µ-XRF data, TOC, C/N ratios, δ18Ocarb and δ13Corg stable isotopes) and a robust chronology based on varve counting, AMS 14C dating and tephrochronology were used to reconstruct the lake system responses to rapid climatic and environmental changes of Trzechowskie paleolake during the late Allerød - Younger Dryas transition. Paleoecological and geochemical analyses, which were carried out in a 4 to 16 years temporal sample resolution, allowed to defining short-termed shifts of the ecosystem that were triggered by abrupt climate changes.\nThe rapid and pronounced cooling at the beginning of the Younger Dryas had a major impact on the lake and its catchment as clearly reflected by not synchronous changes of both, biotic and geochemical proxies. The results of high-resolution analysis indicate (a) an increased precipitation during the Allerød-YD transition, which is responsible for an increase of soil erosion in the catchment during this period, (b) a delayed response of the vegetation compared to the lake depositional system at the YD onset of 20 years, and (c) a non-synchronicity of vegetation responses between Western (Lake Meerfelder Maar) and Eastern European sites (Trzechowskie palaeolake) at the YD onset.\nThis study is a contribution to the Virtual Institute ICLEA (Integrated Climate and Landscape Evolution Analysis) funded by the Helmholtz Association.

            "abstract": "PCRaster GLOBal Water Balance is a grid-based global hydrological model developed at Utrecht University. It simulates soil moisture in vertically stacked soil layers, as well as exchange to the atmosphere and underlying groundwater reservoir. Fluxes are simulated under different land cover types by considering sub-grid variations in topography, vegetation phenology and soil properties. The model includes physically-based schemes for runoff generation and infiltration, resulting in direct runoff, interflow, groundwater recharge and baseflow, as well as channel routing.\nWe present the latest version of the model, PCR-GLOBWB 2.0, consolidating all new developments introduced since PCR-GLOWB 1.0 was first published (van Beek et al, 2011). The main new components are:\nAn inclusion of water demand module and the progressive \u0007introduction of reservoirs and expansion of irrigation areas (Wada et al, 2014)\nAn attribution of water use to ground- and surface water resources and the fate of return flow (de Graaf et al, 2014)\nA routing scheme accounting for variable extent of floodplains (Winsemius et al, 2013)\nPCR-GLOBWB 2.0 now runs at a spatial resolution of 5 arc min (± 10 km) in comparison to the 30 arc min (50 km) resolution used in PCR-GLOWB 1.0. At the finer resolution and with the added components, PCR-GLOBWB 2.0 shows improvements over the previous version: observed discharges from 5142 GRDC stations can be approximated more closely and model efficiency improves, particularly for smaller catchment areas (ρ = 0.87); human impacts, altering the seasonal and inter-annual variation of terrestrial water storage, are well simulated and evident in the validation to GRACE data (ρ = 0.81). These improvements open up new possibilities to assess the state of global water resources.\nAlso, we show an outlook of model results at higher resolutions: 3 arc min (5 km) and 30 arc sec (1 km) for specific test-bed areas: California, Illinois and Rhine-Meuse. We discuss fundamental challenges in high resolution hydrological modeling and address various issues that range from computational challenges, lack of sufficient detail/fine information for parameterization - including atmospheric forcing - and emergent scaling problems at finer resolution (e.g. lateral exchange due to groundwater flow and water distribution network).",

            "abstract": "Fluid pressure Pf  is a major factor controlling natural and induced seismicity. According to the Terzaghi's principle, the effective normal stress σeff = σn (1-α Pf) decreases with increasing Pf, with σn the normal stress and α the Biot coefficient. At α is usually attributed a value of 1, though it may vary with fluid composition and permeability of the fault zone.\nHere we conducted 10 experiments on pre-cut (experimental fault) hollow-cylinders (50/30 mm ext/int diameter) of Carrara marble (99.9% calcite) installed in the rotary shear apparatus SHIVA. The hollow-cylinders were inserted in a fluid vessel filled with water (drained conditions) and subjected to σn of 15 MPa. After this, the Pf was raised to 5 MPa and the shear stress τ to 6.5 MPa, corresponding to an effective friction coefficient μeff = τ / σeff = 0.65 or close to the instability of the experimental fault; then Pf in the vessel was increased stepwise of ΔPf = 0.5 MPa every 10 to 40 s to induce fault instability. The main instability was preceded by short-living slip bursts. Assuming α = 1, the increase in Pf induced the main instability for μeff = 1.3 in the case of stepwise intervals of duration ~10 s and for μeff = 0.7 in stepwise intervals of ~40 s: the time threshold td that resulted in the two different μeff (0.7 and 1.3) was ~30 s.\nWe interpret our experimental observations as due to the permeability decrease of the fault slipping zone which resulted in a smaller α. Wear and comminution during the slip bursts that preceded the main instability produced a low-permeability ultrafine calcite gouge layer in the experimental fault. The gouge layer isolated the fluid in the slipping zone from the fluid in the vessel. As a consequence, the ΔPf increase imposed on the fluid in the vessel was delayed inside the experimental fault. For each ΔPf increase, the Pf in the slipping zone could re-equilibrate with the Pf in the vessel provided that the duration of the stepwise increase was long (40 s) with respect to the fluid diffusion time. Given td ~30 s and the half width of the ring-shaped experimental fault l = 5 mm, the hydraulic diffusivity κ (= l2/td ) was ~ 10-8m2s-1, compatible with κ of a low permeability shale. We conclude that fault strength was controlled by slipping zone permeability and by the magnitude and duration of the fluid pressure increments.",

The major lithology is ignimbrite along with pyroclasts in various sizes. Deformation bands ubiquitously appear in such loose, high-porosity, rocks. This study aims at documenting the occurrence of the deformation bands, understanding their formation mechanism and discussing their tectonic implications.\nThere are two sets of deformation bands with orientations of N60°~80°E and N50°~70°W, respectively, in Shihtiping. The dip angles of both range from 70° to 90°. Commonly, the deformation bands are exposed as single trace or braided trace composed of several individuals. They can be traced easily because they are protruding owning to more weathering-resistant than the host rock. Thickness and separation of single deformation band are in the order of millimeter and millimeter to centimeter, respectively. Thickness of zone of deformation band ranges from few mm to tens of cm and total separation is commonly tens of cm. Based on microscopic examination, mineral assemblages in deformation bands usually include plagioclase, hornblende and augite. Although mineral assemblages are the same as host rock, clasts in deformation bands are rounder and smaller. Thus, it results in closed packing and porosity reduction within deformation bands.\nSummed up the observations, the deformation bands in Shihtiping were formed by cataclasis and can be classified as cataclastic band. They may reflect the regional paelostress state but not accompanied with any tectonic fault.",

            "abstract": "Limited spatial resolution is a major challenge in studying earthquake deformations with observations from GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite gravimetry. Significant attenuation of signal amplitudes would be introduced by truncation of GRACE spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients, and spatial filtering applied to suppress noise in GRACE monthly gravity solutions. We correct the signal attenuation and recover the “true” coseismic gravity changes based on forward modeling, an algorithm used to reduce leakage errors in previous studies. Through coseismic gravity changes predicted by a dislocation model of the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake, we evaluate the reliability of the method by synthetic tests with simulated GRACE stripe errors. The results from synthetic tests indicate that the forward modeling approach is capable of recovering not only signal amplitudes but also spatial patterns of the coseismic signals. We also recover coseismic gravity changes from 2 years of GRACE monthly solutions (RL05, released by Center for Space Research) after the Tohoku-Oki earthquake, which agree well with those predicted by the dislocation model. In addition, by improving the forward modeling algorithm with the constraint of fault plane geometry, we are able to recover the original coseismic gravity changes (with full spatial resolution) from GRACE observations. Preliminary results show that the recovery of coseismic signals helps better understand the distribution of fault slips.",

            "abstract": "Appearance and expansion of C4 plants during the late Miocene was first documented from Siwalik Group of sediments using carbon isotope ratio of soil carbonates. It was proposed that C4 plants appeared drastically in response to change in hydrological cycle. Subsequently, various workers documented evolution and expansion of C4 plants from different Siwalik sections of India, Nepal and Pakistan. Although evolution and expansion of C4 plants was documented in all these studies but nature and timing of expansion of C4 plants showed variations from section to sections. Even from same section, the results varied with change in proxies. The hydrological changes also differ regionally. One of the reasons of differences in results was lack of modern data set from the Indian subcontinent. For example, in many cases δ18O values of New Delhi rainwater has been considered as reference data set and applied to site of investigation with some corrections. The average δ13C values of C3 and C4 plants was considered as -27‰ and -12.5‰ respectively, but modern C3 plants in the Gangetic plain is almost 2.5‰ lower than the value used in those studies. Additional problem raised as preservation of pristine isotopic character of soil organic matter is also apprehensive. To resolve all these issues, the δ13C value of long chain alkane have been used to reconstruct C3-C4 plants after isotopic characterization of modern plants and their biomarker from the Gangetic plain which is equivalent to the past Siwalik flood plain. Additionally, δD values of long chain alkane were also measured. Variations of d13C values of long chain alkane with time show presence of C4 plants in Siwalik from 11 Ma ago and since then gradual increase in C4 plants till 6 Ma followed by a sharp increase. The statistically significant correlation between δD and δ13C values of long chain alkane show that positive impact of hydrological change on abundance of C3-C4 plants.",

            "abstract": "Five years after the 2008 Wenchuan megathrust earthquake of Mw 7.9 in the middle Longmen Shan on the east margin of Tibetan Plateau, another thrust earthquake of Mw 6.6 occurred on April 20, 2013 near Lushan County, in the front belt of the southern Longmen Shan. This latter earthquake caused 196 deaths, 21 people missing, and injured 11470 people. Different from the bigger Wenchuan earthquake, this earthquake did not produce a surface rupture zone, and the outcropped faults in the earthquake area were not obviously active in the late Quaternary, which make it difficult to analyse the seismogenic structure. The causal fault was supposed to be the known exposed faults or unknown buried fault, but little is known about the active tectonics in the area. The Qingyijiang River traverses the east margin of Tibetan Plateau and the earthquake area, its relict terraces should have been deformed by the active tectonics. Based on the longitudinal profile of the Qingyijiang River, this study quantitatively analyse the late Quaternary tectonic deformation, and further discussed the seismotectonics. Our study reveals that the principal deformation in the late Quaternary was folding (Fig. 1), while the early Cenozoic folds and thrusts in the Cretaceous to Paleogene strata were not obviously active in the same stage. With oil seismic exploration and aftershocks relocation data, we further discuss the relationship between surface deformation and deep structures. The new folding is inferred to be a typical fault-bend fold involving the basement, which is controlled by the newest flat-ramp-flat structure in front of the Longmen Shan. The newest ramp appears to have controlled the rupture and the surface deformation of the 2013 Lushan earthquake. In the process of thrust sheet sliding towards foreland along the flat-ramp-flat detachment, the ramp acts as a locking structure where earthquake ruptures. The coseismic surface deformation by GPS data seems to be passive folding of the thrust sheet climbing the ramp.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic disturbance of natural vegetation can profoundly alter the physical, chemical and biological processes within soils. Rapid removal of topsoil during intense farming can result in an imbalance between soil production through chemical weathering and physical erosion, with direct implications on local biogeochemical cycling. However, the feedback mechanisms between soil erosion, chemical weathering and biogeochemical cycling in response to anthropogenic forcing are not yet fully understood.\nIn this paper, we analyze dynamic soil properties for a rapidly changing anthropogenic landscape in the Spanish Betic Cordillera; and focus on the coupling between physical erosion, soil production and soil chemical weathering. Modern erosion rates were quantified through analysis of sediment deposition volumes behind check dams, and represent catchment-average erosion rates over the last 10 to 50 years. Soil production rates are derived from in-situ produced 10Be nuclide concentrations, and represent long-term flux rates. In each catchment, soil chemical weathering intensities were calculated for two soil-regolith profiles.\nAlthough Southeast Spain is commonly reported as the European region that is most affected by land degradation, modern erosion rates are low (140 t ha−1 yr−1). About 50 % of the catchments are losing soils at a rate of less than 60 t km−2 yr−1. Our data show that modern erosion rates are roughly of the same magnitude as the long-term or cosmogenically-derived erosion rates in the Betic Cordillera. Soils developed on weathered metamorphic rocks have no well-developed profile characteristics, and are generally thin and stony. Nevertheless, soil chemical weathering intensities are high; and question the occurrence of past soil truncation.",

We confirmed that we could recover the gravity anomalies similar to the Level-2 data with spatial resolution of ~0.8 degrees using low altitude portions of the data.\nNext, we downloaded the GRAIL Level-2 data set (spherical harmonics with degree/order complete to 660) together with the topography data by LRO laser altimetry, and tried to estimate the pin-point surface crustal density. First, we selected a certain square as large as ~60 km, and compared the gravity and topography values at grid points within the square. They are roughly proportional, and the slope provides information on the density of the material making the topography.\nThis method, however, causes apparent positive correlation between density and average topographic height of about 0.2 g/cm^3/km. We (wrongly) assume that the mass anomalies lie on the reference surface. Then, the mass above (below) the reference surface is interpreted heavier/lighter than its real density. We performed a-posteriori correction of the altitude-dependent errors in the estimated density.\nWe finally focus on a few positive gravity anomalies on the nearside (such as those close to the Copernicus crater) that are not associated with any topographic high. We will try to constrain the subsurface structure of the dense material responsible for the anomaly using both Level-1b and -2 data.",

Due to low recovery (<20%), Site U1434 provides little opportunity to analyze fractures and veins; however, we carefully described and analyzed fractures and veins at Sites U1431 and U1433. Several hundred fractures and veins were observed and we measured ~75% of those, whereas the other ~25% are either irregular or in small branches and thus could not be measured easily. Most of the fractures and veins have no obvious lateral offset or striations on the fractured surface. The veins are generally infilled fractures, whereas many fractures are reactivated along preexisting veins. Thus, the total number of fractures and veins can be used as an indicator of the degree of rock fragmentation. Shapes and contact relationships suggest that most of the fractures and veins resulted from cooling effects. Comparison between fracture and vein frequency with lithology indicates that high fragmentation occurs in the pillow basalt, whereas low fragmentation corresponds to massive flow basalt at Site U1433. At Site U1431, the relationship is similar, but more complicated. The frequency of fractures and veins at Site U1431 is almost double that of Site U1433. The basalt is also more altered at Site U1431 than U1433. These results provide constraints on investigation of the rock fragmentation and alteration processes of basaltic basement of the South China Sea.",

            "abstract": "Fenton’s reagents (H2O2 and Fe2+ catalyst commonly) have been widely used in soil and groundwater remediation. But the excessive H2O2 decomposition and the pH modification (acidification) problem have been limitations for Fenton based remediation strategies. The Electro-Fenton (E- Fenton) processes has been recently developed to solve the problems, in which Fe2+ or H2O2are generated in situ as continuing source of Fenton's reagents.\nIn this study, a novel CB-PTFE cathode and a Fe cathode were employed to generate H2O2 and Fe2+ in situ simultaneously. The generated reactive oxidizing species, i.e., O2,H2O2 and hydroxyl radical (HO•), oxidized bio-refractory organics to nontoxic matters in groundwater. Automatic pH adjustments are achieved by appropriately arraying the electrodes. Laboratory batch tests and column tests for the E-Fenton oxidation and hybrid electrolysis system were conducted to evaluate the transformation efficiency of chlorine benzene. Results from batch experiments suggested the CB-PTFE cathode was effective for reducing O2 to H2O2. The H2O2 concentration reached 468 mg/L under the condition of pH 3.0 and 30mA/cm2 in 60 minutes, which was 5 and 10 times of that with a graphite and C-felt cathode. The removal efficiency of chlorine benzene reached 80% in 20 minutes. Both chlorine benzene degradation and H2O2 production increased with decreasing solution pH and increasing current density. The results from the columns tests proved that the in situ E-Fenton system is a feasible method for groundwater remediation.",

The deficit is then used together with the relationship between the depth to groundwater table and the TOPMODEL topographic index in the development of a watershed storage capacity model taking into account the effect of soil properties and topography. Based on statistical analysis of the storage capacity of each grid point, the watershed storage capacity curve can be obtained. The watershed-scale capacity curve is used to replace the calibrated storage capacity curve of the traditional Xin'anjiang model. The Ziluosha sub-basin of Huaihe River basin is chosen as a test site to validate the new model and to study the influence of terrain and soil types on the watershed storage capacity. Results show that the new model can better simulate the event-based flood hydrograph compared to that obtained with the traditional Xin'anjiang model. The use of an explicit formula for the storage capacity in the new model reduces the number of user calibrated parameters in the traditional Xin'anjiang model, which provides a new tool for hydrological simulation in ungauged basins.",

            "abstract": "Direct groundwater seepage in a lake (DGSL) can be a major component to its water and nutrient budget. Groundwater extraction around a lake may affect the DGSL, thus it can be expected that it would also impact the lake. In the Philippines, Laguna de Bay which is the second largest freshwater lake in South-east Asia and used primarily for fisheries, is under significant water development pressure. Along the southern coast of the lake, in the Calamba-Los Banos area, rapid urbanization and development of the water resort industry, including hot spring spas, are expected to have led to a rapid increase in groundwater extraction. This study aims to establish the effect of this development to the DGSL in this part of the lake. As a first step, we utilized towed electrical resistivity (ER) profiling to identify and map the potential and type of groundwater seepage off the southern coast of the lake. SRTM digital elevation models and synthetic aperture radar images were used to delineate lineaments which are potential fractures that cut across the study area. ER profiles indicate widespread occurrence of GDL across the shallower parts of the lake. In the more offshore, deeper parts of the lake, DGSL appears to be more limited possibly due to more muddy sediments there. However, in this area, narrow, vertical high resistivity columns cut through the lake floor suggesting more discrete GDLs possibly controlled by faults.",

            "abstract": "Because of the rapid compression between the Eurasian Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate, the Central Range of the Taiwan Island continued to quickly uplift. Moreover, because of being located in the subtropical area, Taiwan has abundant rainfall, and has distinct wet and dry season. Typhoons which almost brought violent rain, struck Taiwan average four times a year during the summer. This extreme tectonic and weather condition makes that a large number of sediments easily to be taken away from the mountainous area and output to the downstream estuary in a short time. These eroded sediments can be classified into two categories. One is bedrock sediments, and the other is suspended sediments which could be detected by the satellite remote sensing technique. In previous studies, some suspended sediment concentration (SSC) predictions were carried out by using optical satellites imagery in different areas. As we know, the more suspension sediment in water can directly reflect the higher reflectance of solar radiation. In addition, the exact form of the relationship between SSC and reflectance also depends on the mineralogy, color, and size of the sediments. Therefore, most studies developed unique relationships by relating field measurements of SSC to reflectance data from satellite imagery. The Pinan River is the largest river in eastern Taiwan. It rises in the Central Range and flows through Taitung County for 84 kilometers. Statistically, in Taiwan, more than 40 percent typhoons struck and landed from the Pinan River watershed. Abundant rainfall coupled with short channel caused plenty of sediments output from the Pinan River. In this study, we focus on Pinan River estuary by using SSC field data which was got from the Hydrological Year Book of Taiwan published by Water Resources Agency every year. Because of lack of field data, we got daily river discharge to establish the Rating Curve and predict daily SSC. Moreover, we also used FORMOSAT-2 imagery in band 3 and band 4 to monitor suspended sediments and identify an appropriate SSC-reflectance model. According to this model, we could estimate suspended sediments which depended on the rainfall, after typhoons passing through the Taiwan. Furthermore, we discussed the behavior of suspended sediments, including concentration, direction, and distribution.",

We conducted remanence and induced experiments on the samples to determine degree of serpentinization. Stepwise alternating field (AF) and thermal demagnetization experiments from 2.5 to 70 mT and from 28 to 575°C, respectively, yield univectorial diagrams showing the removal of secondary components (e.g., VRM, IRM, CRM etc) by isolating a Characteristic Remanent Magnetization (ChRM) at low fields and temperatures. The normalized intensity of demagnetization J/Jo shows the decrease of the magnetization of the specimens where about 50% of the original magnetization is lost at about 5 mT and 100°C (i.e. Median Destructive Field). The stereograms show magnetic stability of the specimens by determining the directional behavior after 4 demagnetization steps (from 7.5-10 mT fields and low temps). Induced magnetization such as magnetic granulometry tests, sIRM's, hysteresis saturation loops and back-fields were performed. Diagnostic values of Mrs/Ms and Hrc/Hc determine the domain structure of a magnetic sample. The magnetic grain sizes were determined using the protocol of Dunlop [2002 a and b]. Most of the samples are distributed over the Pseudo-Single Domain (PSD) range with a certain degree of clustering. Curie points were obtained by measuring their low-field susceptibility vs. temperature (k-T) from 28 °C up to 700 °C in an Argon atmosphere showing a minimum of 1-4 magnetic mineral phases with temperatures ranging from ~100°C up to 640°C, which are predominantly Ti-poor and Ti-rich magnetites and magnetite. Samples recovered by the Shinkai 6500 show appreciable variation in bulk susceptibility (22.3 x 10-3 to 142 x 10-6 SI units). The samples appear to be modestly to moderately serpentinized based on their magnetic properties (magnetic stability and pseudo single-domain character) and they do not show the exponential increase of NRM, magnetic susceptibility and magnetite content during serpentinization (implying a major change in alteration conditions) as is the case of other areas such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR).",

            "abstract": "Ever since the deployment of large regional seismic arrays (e.g. USArray), numerous contributions have been made to develop refined structural models of the Earth’s interior. However the dataset has not been explored in earthquake source studies except back-projections of large earthquakes. Waveform coherence across a seismic array is crucial for back-projection earthquake source imaging. While previous studies indicate waveform coherency decays dramatically with distance and frequency, their adoption of time windows with fixed duration may naturally degrade the coherence at high frequency. In this study, we measure the correlation coefficients of teleseismic waveforms recorded by USArray using window lengths proportional to 1/frequency.\nBased on the coherency curve of USArray as a function of interstation distance, we may constrain earthquake source properties through data-mining. Preliminary results show that the coherency is high across the USArray over inter-station distances >10 wavelengths and up to 5 Hz. The coherence of large/shallow earthquakes decays faster with distance than small/deep earthquakes. For the same earthquake, coherence falls slower along the ray-path than across it. One possible explanation for such patterns is finite source effect including scattering near the source. We seek to systematically measure the waveform coherency of earthquakes of different properties, for example, magnitude, focal depth, faulting type, rupture size and aspect ratio, some of which are hard to resolve with conventional observations. By establishing a multi-variable dependence of the source properties on the USArray coherence, we may reduce the scattering of stress drop calculation and constrain other source properties that are difficult to be determined by conventional approaches. Such new observations may shed light on the long-stand debate of earthquake self-similarity.",

            "abstract": "Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the fundamental terms of the hydrologic cycle at all scales, yet it is also one of the more difficult to model, being influenced by many factors, such as air temperature and humidity, soil moisture, vegetation species, and horizontal advection. Therefore, practical applications of hydrological process-based models of coupled surface and subsurface flow where ET plays a significant role are typically subjected to large uncertainties. A simplified method for computing ET, implemented in the integrated model CATchment HYdrology (CATHY) and based on a switching procedure for the boundary conditions (BCs) at the soil surface, has been recently demonstrated capable of reproducing measured ET in a semi-arid catchment in southeastern Australia, mostly covered by shallow-rooted vegetation. Here we run the model in the same Australian catchment to compare the BC-switching method with the commonly used root water uptake model by Feddes. We investigate i) the trade-offs between the two ET calculation methods, ii) the maximum root depth at which the BC-switching method is able to match catchment-scale ET without losing physical meaning, and iii) the impact of oxygen stress (not included in the BC-switching method) on the main terms of the catchment water balance. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis on the parameters of the Feddes' model pointed out that the maximum root depth is the major control on catchment-scale evapotranspiration and streamflow. The subsequent comparison with the BC-switching method highlighted that the latter is suitable to reproduce ET when the root depth of the vegetation does not exceed approximately 50 cm. For deeper rooting systems, the BC-switching not only fails to match the fluxes, but is also affected by numerical artifacts making the simulated drying and wetting processes physically meaningless. These findings are confirmed by further simulations run with a hypothetical wetter scenarios. Finally, we show that oxygen stress can have a significant impact on both ET and streamflow, even though these effects do not depend much on the soil moisture value that defines oxygen stress onset.",

            "abstract": "Numerous anatectic blocks derived from a sheeted dike complex appear in a block-rich zone between the foliated gabbro and a large plagiogranite complex in the Oman ophiolite. Five blocks from blocks 1 to 5 in a descending stratigraphic order are studied. Host rocks are quart diorite (block 1), diorite (block 2), massive gabbronorite (block 3), and foliated gabbronorite and olivine gabbronorite (blocks 4 and 5). The textural and petrographical features vary depending on the depths of the blocks. Block 1 preserves a doleritic texture despite of the presence of a granulite facies mineral assemblage. Abundant mafic and quartz globules in blocks 2 and 3 suggest processes of in-situ partial melting and melt accumulation. Hornblende occurs in the globules but is absent from the matrix. Hornblendes and quartz decrease with increasing depth, suggesting the progressive extraction of partial melts from the blocks. Assimilation of the host gabbro by the expelled silicic melts is shown by the co-existence of quartz and olivine. The SiO2 and trace element contents of the blocks decrease with increasing depths. With decreasing REE contents, there is an increase in positive Eu anomalies, and the REE patterns vary from flat to patterns that are depleted in light REEs. The rates of partial meting evaluated by a mass balance equation and trace element contents increase with depths.\nInverted pigeonite appears in the blocks 3 to 5, and is absent at a shallower level of the blocks 1 and 2. The thermal gradient in the block-rich zone, ~100 m thick, was very high more than ~1°C/1m. At the shallower level of the block-rich zone, the temperatures do not attain the minimum stability limit of pigeonites, ~ 965 °C. Elevating temperatures with depth result in the appearance of pigeonites. However, they are limited inside the blocks due to varying Mg# values within the blocks. Efficient extraction of partial melts, and/or intensive effects of assimilation with gabbroic magmas at the margin of the blocks caused such Mg# variations. Therefore, pigeonites disappear in the margin, whereas they persisted inside the blocks. Thus, appearance of pigeonites due to increasing temperatures with depths and disappearance of pigeonites due to increasing Mg# within the blocks are encountered.",

Recently, a new type of seismic event, referred to as a “glacial earthquake”, has been recognized. Such earthquakes are generated by the movements of large masses of ice within the terminal regions of glacier, and represent a new approach for monitoring ice sheet dynamics. In 2009, the GreenLand Ice Sheet monitoring Network (GLISN) was initiated as international project to monitor changes in ice sheet by constructing a large broadband seismological network in and around Greenland.\nJapan is a partner country from when the GLISN project was launched, and has been sending an expedition team every year from 2011. In 2011, the Japanese GLISN team, together with the USA team, installed the dual seismic–GPS station ICESG-GLS2 in the middle of the Greenland ice cap. In 2012 and 2013, we performed maintenance at the ICESG-GLS2, DY2G-GLS1, and NUUK stations. In August 2014, we plan to participate in maintenance operations on three dual seismic–GPS stations on ice (ICESG-GLS2, DY2G-GLS1, and NEEM-GLS3), as well as two stations on bedrock at East coast (DBG and SOEG). This presentation will summarize our field activities for four years, and show results from preliminary analysis with the retrieved data.\nThe Japanese GLISN team has been supported by JSPS KAKENHI 24403006.",

            "abstract": "ISNet (http://isnet.fisica.unina.it) is deployed in Southern Apennines along the active fault system responsible for the 1980, M 6.9 Irpinia earthquake. ISNet consists of 32 seismic stations equipped with both strong motion and velocimetric instruments (either broadband or short-period), with the aim of capture a broad set of seismic signals, from ambient noise to strong motion. Real time and near real time procedures run at ISNet with the goal of monitoring the seismicity, check possible space-time anomalies, detect seismic sequences and launch an earthquake early warning in the case of potential significant ground shaking in the area.\nTo understand the role of fluids on the seismicity of the area, we investigated velocity and attenuation models. The former is built from accurate cross-correlation picking and S wave detection based onto polarization analysis. Joint inversion of both P and S arrival times is then based on a linearized multi-scale tomographic approach. Attenuation is instead obtained from inversion of displacement spectra, deconvolving for the source effect. High VP/VS  and QS/QP >1 were found within a ~15 km wide rock volume where intense microseismicity is located. This indicates that concentration of seismicity is possibly controlled by high pore fluid pressure. This earthquake reservoir may come from a positive feedback between the seismic pumping that controls the fluid transmission through the fractured damage zone and the low permeability of cross fault barrier, increasing the fluid pore pressure within the fault bounded block.\nIn this picture, sequences mostly occur at the base of this fluid rich layer. They show an anomalous pattern in the earthquake occurrence per magnitude classes; main events evolve with a complex source kinematics, as obtained from backprojection of apparent source time functions, indicating possible directivity effects. In this area sequences might be the key for understanding the transition between the deep-seated structures and the shallower earthquake reservoir.",

            "abstract": "We analyzed key features of annual flows (mean, variability and skewness) and their changes during the past 50 years at 510 hydrological observation stations in China. Regional statistical features of annual flows were explored by empirical relationships between hydrologic characteristics and relevant independent parameters, e.g. mean annual flow vs. standard deviation of annual flows, coefficient of variation of annual flows vs. catchment area, and mean annual flow vs. catchment area. Changes of the statistical features were analyzed by comparison of these features before and after change points of the annual flow series, which were identified using a statistical method and the relationship between the annual streamflow and precipitation. The results indicate that: 1) the relationship between the statistical features and the relevant independent parameters shows the separation of the two curves, representing north China (arid and semi-arid regions) and south China (humid regions). 2) The annual flows and their statistical features were changed significantly at nearly 70% of the observation stations during the period 1960–2000. The annual mean streamflow decreases in north China; however, the increasing trends occur in south and southwest China. 3) The annual streamflow over most areas of China is fed by precipitation, however, the decline in streamflow is faster than the decreases of precipitation since 1970s in arid and semi-arid of north China. Thus the annual streamflow presents a non-stationary change over time and space due to the precipitation variations and the strong influence of human activities.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, the development of a new photogrammetric technique, called Structure from Motion (SfM), has generated a great interest in the field of glaciology, as well as in glacial and periglacial geomorphology. This technique, coupled with dense image matching algorithms such as multi-view stereo (MVS), allows to obtain high resolution three-dimensional models of the surface employing sequences of overlapping images shot with common uncalibrated digital cameras.\nThis study investigates the potential of the SfM-MVS approach in reconstructing the surface of a glacier and a neighbouring rock glacier located in Alta Val de La Mare (Ortles-Cevedale, Eastern Italian Alps). The photos were taken from the ground using a consumer-grade SLR camera and processed using the computer vision-based software package Agisoft PhotoScan in order to generate the 3D models. A contemporaneous DTM surveyed by LiDAR provided high-resolution terrain information which was used to locate the GCPs needed to georeference the photogrammetric 3D model. The LiDAR DTM was also used as a reference for estimating the accuracy of the photogrammetric DTMs.\nThe results highlight that from a series of digital images taken from the ground it is possible to reconstruct the surface of both glaciers and rock glaciers, with good accuracy. The effectiveness of the photogrammetric method was also evaluated in light of the different substrata (fresh snow, old snow, firn, ice and debris) which were present at the moment of surveys, and of spatial characteristics as the distance from the camera and the terrain gradient.\nThe new digital photogrammetric methods proved to be well suited for low-budget research and application in remote areas, thus becoming potential alternatives to the efficient but also expensive and logistically-demanding LiDAR technologies for the evaluation of the glacier mass balance with the geodetic method, and for the assessment of the surface displacement of rock glaciers.",

For diverse oceanographic settings in the Late Quaternary, we compare coccolith Sr/Ca productivity records with those of other productivity indicators and proxies for mechanisms of productivity forcing. For the Somalia Basin in the Arabian Sea, coccolith Sr/Ca shows a large variation coherent with precessional forcing of wind strength as a mechanism for productivity regulation. During the glacial, the Sr/Ca peak is decoupled from productivity indicators based on organic C accumulation rate. For the Northern Bay of Bengal, coccolith Sr/Ca, Ba/Ti, and relative abundance of G. bulloides, all suggest greater productivity during the interglacial periods, consisted with Nd isotopic evidence for greater riverine nutrient inputs. In the Andaman Sea, coccolith Sr/Ca is highest during precessional maxima in the summer monsoon, consistent with proxies for chemical weathering in the Irawaddy rivershed. In the Eastern Mediterranean, coccolith Sr/Ca is on average low, and peaks during the E. Holocene interval characterized by deposition of sapropel S1. The peak in Sr/Ca however is comparable to the level maintained throughout the Holocene in the Western Mediterranean, where no sapropel occurs, implicating deepwater oxygen levels as a significant contributor to sapropel formation. Finally, on the Agulhas Bank, minima in coccolith Sr/Ca occur during obliquity minima which are periods of anomalous equatorward deposition of IRD in the Southern Ocean. Northward explansion of the westerly wind field during these cold intervals, block upwelling on the Agulhas Bank and result in low productivity.",

            "abstract": "HBV is a conceptual hydrological model extensively used in operational hydrological forecasting and water balance studies. In this study, we apply the HBV model on the upper Euphrates basin in Turkey, which has 10 624 km2 area. The Euphrates basin is largely fed from snow precipitation whereby nearly two-thirds occur in winter and may remain in the form of snow for half of the year. We analyze individual sensitivity of the parameters by calibrating the model using the Multi-Objective Shuffled Complex Evolution (MOSCEM) algorithm. The calibration is performed against snow cover area (SCA) in addition to runoff data for the water years 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. The SCA product has been developed in the framework of the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), Satellite Application Facility on Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management (H-SAF) Project. The product is generated by using data from Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) instrument making observations from a geostationary satellite Meteosat Second Generation (MSG). In the previous study evaluation of the model was done with commonly used statistical performance metrics (Nash-Sutcliffe) for high and low flows, volume error and root mean square error (RMSE). In this study signature metrics, which are based on the flow duration curve (FDC) are used to see the performance of the model for low flows. In order to consider a fairly balanced evaluation between high and low flow phases we divided the flow duration curve into segments of high, medium and low flow phases, and additionally into very high and very low phases. Root mean square error (RMSE) is used to evaluate the performance in these segments. The sensitivity analysis of the parameters around the calibrated optimum points showed that parameters of the soil moisture and evapotranspiration (FC, beta and LPrat) have a strong effect in the total volume error of the model. The parameters from the response and transformation routines (LSUZ, K1, K0 and bmax) have a significant influence on the peak flows. It is observed that the parameters of snow routine (Tmelt, CSF and DDF) have strong effect in high flows and total volume. The parameters FC, K0, K1 And K2 are found to have effect on low flows from the signature metrics.",

A robust technique is developed to detect and track LPS from reanalysis and climate model simulations. This technique is applied to Coupled General Circulation Model (CGCM) simulations of fifth generation Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP5). Analysis of LPS tracks in RCP8.5 scenario simulations show that, under extreme warming projections, the spatial pattern of monsoon synoptic activity over India changes significantly. The changes in synoptic activity in warming scenario are manifested as weakening of the monsoon trough and a south-westward shift of the LPS tracks. Consistent with the changes in the spatial structure of synoptic activity, the ratio of LPS-related to LPS-unrelated rainfall also changes. The change in the pattern of synoptic activity is well explained by the largest mode of variability in surface temperature over Southeast Asia, suggesting that the changes in LPS are triggered by external radiative forcing.",

            "abstract": "The growing use of PPCPs results in their increasing release to the aquatic environment. Consequently, understanding the fate of PPCPs under environmentally relevant conditions that account for dynamic flow and varying redox states is critical. In this study, the transport of two organometallic PPCPs, Gd-DTPA and Roxarsone (As complex) and their metal salts (Gd(NO3)3, AsNaO2), is investigated. The former is used widely as a contrasting agent for MRI, while the latter is applied extensively as a food additive in the broiler poultry industry. Both of these compounds are excreted from the body, almost unchanged chemically. Gadolinium complexes are not fully eliminated in wastewater treatment and can reach groundwater via irrigation with treated wastewater; Roxarsone can enter groundwater via leaching from manure used as fertilizer. Studies have shown that the transport of PPCPs in groundwater is affected by environmental conditions such as redox states, pH, and soil type. For this study, column experiments using sand or Mediterranean red sandy clay soil were performed under several redox conditions: aerobic, nitrate-reducing, iron-reducing, sulfate-reducing, methanogenic, and very strongly chemical reducing. Batch experiments to determine adsorption isotherms were also performed for the complexes and metal salts. We found that Gd-DTPA transport was affected by the soil type and was not affected by the redox conditions. In contrast, Roxarsone transport was affected mainly by the different redox conditions, showing delayed breakthrough curves as the conditions became more biologically reduced (strong chemical reducing conditions did not affect the transport). We also observed that the metal salts show essentially no transport while the organic complexes display much faster breakthrough. The results suggest that transport of these PPCPs through soil and groundwater is determined by the redox conditions, as well as by soil type and the form of the applied metal (as salt or organic complex).",

            "abstract": "CO2 is widely considered the key mechanism for translating Northern Hemisphere Milankovitch forcing into globally synchronous glacial-interglacial cycles. A major line of reasoning in support of CO2 is its apparent correlation with tropical SSTs. I reassess this argument with two new Mg/Ca reconstructions from the eastern tropical Pacific stretching back ~230,000 years. These records are combined with previous ones to construct a regional SST composite with unrivaled resolution and data density. Comparison with Antarctic temperature underscores a tight thermal coupling between the two regions down to the details of distinct millennial scale events. Comparison with CO2 on the other hand demonstrates a more complex relationship. I focus here on a large and robust lead of SST over CO2 during the 5e-d transition, implying that CO2 is not the main driver of tropical SST during glacial inception. Based on independent evidence that deep-ocean temperatures also cooled in advance of CO2, I propose an alternative mechanism: the cooling signal originates in the surface North Atlantic from Milankovitch forcing, enters the deep ocean with North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), and spreads globally with deep ocean circulation. In the Southern Ocean NADW becomes precursor to Antarctic Intermediate Water and Antarctic Bottom Water transmitting the signal to large volumes of the ocean interior. In the eastern tropical Pacific the signal emerges when Antarctic Intermediate Water upwells to the surface, spreads westward with the large-scale equatorial currents and enters the Indian Ocean with the Indonesian Through Flow, synchronizing the Indo-Pacific tropical SST response. In this view ocean circulation does the “heavy lifting” in globalizing the climatic cooling during glaciation, but CO2 may play a more prominent role during deglaciation, which is dynamically not the reverse process of glaciation.",

            "abstract": "Kimberley was chosen as a major waypoint of the MSL rover Curiosity on its way to Mount Sharp. APXS data before drilling showed interestingly high K, Fe and Zn. This warranted drilling of the fine-grained sandstone for detailed investigations with SAM and Chemin.\nWith significantly lower Na, Al and higher K, Mg and Fe, the composition of the drill target Windjana is very distinct from the previous ones in the mudstones at Yellowknife Bay. Up to 2000 ppm Br and 4000 ppm Zn post-brush were among the highest measured values in Gale Crater. The excavated fines, stemming from about 6cm, showed lower Br, but even higher Zn.\nPreliminary Chemin results indicate K-feldspar and magnetite being major mineral phases in Windjana, which is consistent with the pre drill APXS result and derived CIPW norms.\nInside the accessible work volume of the arm at the drill site ChemCam exposed a greyish, shinier patch of rock underneath the dust, dubbed Stephen. ChemCam sees a high Mn signal in most of the spots. An APXS integration revealed high MnO as well (~4%), in addition to high Mg, Cl,K,Ni,Zn,Br,Cu,Ge and for the first time an APXS detectable amount of ~300 ppm Co.\nThe surface might reflect a thin surface layer and may underestimate the higher Z elemental concentration since the APXS analysis assumes an infinite sample. Important elemental correlations are likely not impacted. A four spot daytime raster of Stephen before leaving the drill site showed a good correlation of Mn with Zn, Cu and Ni. All spots have 3-3.5% Cl, the highest values measured on Mars so far. While the stratigraphic setting of the Stephen sample is discussed elsewhere, the similarity with Mn deep-sea nodules is striking, e.g. the APXS calibration sample GBW07296.

            "abstract": "A long-standing question in palaeoecology has been to determine the importance of climate in driving vegetation change since the last deglaciation. Here, we investigate the local-to-regional dynamics of vegetation change during the Lateglacial and the Holocene in Northern Europe. We extracted sites from the European Pollen Database and used the squared-chord distance (SCD) dissimilarity metric to identify time periods of high pollen assemblage turnover representing periods of abrupt vegetation change. In addition, a set of generalised additive mixed models were applied to investigate the underlying dynamics of two periods of higher rates of turnover: the Younger Dryas–Early Holocene transition (11.6-9.0 ka) and Early–Middle Holocene (9.0-6.0 ka). Results indicated that consistently high SCDs were found during the abrupt climate changes of the Lateglacial–Early Holocene transition, and there was a strong linear relationship between pollen assemblage turnover and large directional temperature changes at this time. In contrast, patterns of turnover during the climatic events during the Holocene were site specific. During the EMH we found evidence that the vegetation response was non-linear and highly variable across and between regions. Our results have implications for understanding the relationship between threshold dynamics and the amplitude of an extrinsic forcing. Across the Lateglacial–Early Holocene boundary the rate and magnitude of temperature change was large enough to override any site-specific thresholds, resulting in large assemblage turnovers. In contrast, during the Holocene the vegetation response was mediated by intrinsic factors, which resulted in varying turnover rates between regions. The next research challenge is to attempt to determine whether it is possible to appreciate the velocity and rate of change that is necessary to illicit these different responses– and whether this rate is the same across biomes.",

Results include the spatial and temporal distribution of cloud fraction, the cloud top pressure and cloud top temperature, and the cloud optical thickness and effective radius of both liquid water and ice clouds. The cloud fraction varies with regions we selected, with a value ~ 60% for China region only. Seasonal variations of cloud fraction will also be represented. Overall, the cloudiness over china southern region is much higher than northern. A clear cloud fraction regional distribution pattern was found: two regions with large amount of clouds and two regions with small amount. A low pressure center is located over Tibetan Plateau accompanying the coldest cloud tops (colder than 230 K). The cloud optical thickness demonstrates almost the same regional distribution pattern among various seasons with large values in southern China and small values in north, which is most likely associated with the cloud types. The cloud ice effective particle radius much larger in the northern China than in the southern for all seasons, whereas the regional distribution of cloud droplet effective radius depends on seasons, likely reflecting their differences in aerosol-cloud interactions and atmospheric dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Plutons have long been viewed as crystallized remnants of large magma reservoirs, a concept now challenged by high precision geochronological data coupled with thermal models. Similarly, the classical view of silicic eruptions fed by long-lived magma reservoirs that slowly differentiate between mafic recharges is being questioned by petrological and geophysical studies. In both cases, a key and yet unresolved issue is the rate of magma transfer in the crust. Here, we use thermal analysis of magma transport to calculate the minimum rate of magma transfer through dykes. We find that unless the crust is exceptionally hot the recharge of magma reservoirs requires a magma supply rate of at least ~ 0.01 km3/yr, much higher than the long-term growth rate of plutons, which demonstrates unequivocally that igneous bodies must grow incrementally. This analysis argues also for magma reservoirs being short-lived and erupting rapidly after a recharge of already differentiated magma. These findings have strong implications for the monitoring of dormant volcanic systems, and raise questions on our ability to interpret geodetic surface signals related to incipient eruptions.",

The relationship between turbulence and reconnection, and its contribution to magnetospheric transport and dynamics will be evaluated. Observational studies to date have shown that the magnetotail rarely exhibits simple steady convection; instead, flows in the magnetotail have a high level of fluctuations. Flows driven on the scale of the entire system are well described by MHD and break up into structures that cascade to smaller scales. MHD simulation studies have shown the presence of realistic fluctuation spectra both in case studies where direct comparisons to observations have been made and in idealized test cases which have been compared to the statistical studies of observed events. The simulations do a good job of representing the effects of dissipation and yield dissipative scale lengths that are comparable to those inferred from observations. At intermediate, meso-scales, which receive energy from both large and small scales, turbulent processes are important in the plasma sheet, in particular around dipolarization fronts. We will explore the interaction between large-scale and smaller-scale fluctuations and their contributions to the magnetotail current sheet structure. We will use a global MHD simulation and a two dimensional version of the iPIC3Dimplicit particle in cell simulation separately to examine how turbulence is related to global and local processes involved in the current sheet.",

            "abstract": "Recently, a new approach of modelling over an equivalent cross-section was developed to reduce the computational time/effort in distributed hydrologic modelling at large catchment scale. In this approach, equivalent cross sections constitute the modelling elements and are formulated by weighting the topographic and physiographic properties of the part or entire first-order sub-basins. Model simulations are performed at the scale of equivalent cross-sections using a 2-dimensional, Richards’ equation based distributed hydrological model. Simulated fluxes from every cross section are multiplied by the respective area from which the equivalent cross-sections were formulated in a first-order sub-basin. These fluxes are aggregated at a catchment scale to estimate the total fluxes.\nDespite the improvement in computational efficiency using the equivalent cross-section approach, delineation of the equivalent cross-sections across regional scales remains a challenge due to large amount of spatial data processing involved. Here, we developed a workflow based approach to automate the pre- and post-processing steps involved in delineation and modelling of equivalent cross-sections. A series of tools are developed to automate the equivalent cross-section delineation process, model simulations across multiple cross sections, and visualizing model results. The automation steps include: delineation of first order sub-basins of a catchment using a digital elevation model, landform delineation in every first order sub-basin based on topographic and geomorphic properties of the sub-basin/catchment, formulation of equivalent cross sections and extraction of relevant biophysical parameters (vegetation and soils) using spatially distributed land cover and soil information. The automation procedure improves the usability of the proposed approach and significantly reduces the model setup time for large catchment scale simulations.",

            "abstract": "Diagonite meteorites are commonly thought to represent the deep crust or mantle material of Vesta-like bodies. Here, we present textural analysis by neutron diffraction and microstructural and microchemical data on diagonite Yamato 74013. The meteorite is composed mainly of orthopyroxene with inclusions and interstitial grains of troilite and chromite. A coarse grained orthopyroxene – troilite vein transects the sample. Neutron diffraction data shows a distinct crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) of the orthopyroxene grains. Such strong CPO is unusual for meteorites such as chondrites and stony meteorites.\nDetailed electron backscatter diffraction analysis confirms that the origin of the preferred orientation is solid state crystal plastic deformation. All phases in the matrix of the rock show crystal plastic deformation, chromite shows distinct substructures, with inclusions of troilite. Orthopyrxone grains are between 50-120 microns in diameter and exhibit irregular interlocking grain boundaries, subgrain boundaries and continuous crystal lattice bending. Grain boundary morphology suggests post-deformation recrystallization with a dominance of grain boundary migration. Orthopyroxene within the vein have traces of S and show straight grain boundaries to each other. Vein troilite grains are interstitial and reach sizes up to 50 times larger than in the matrix.\nOur results suggest that deep in Yamato’s parent body, orthopyroxene is deformed in a crystal plastic regime and experienced significant post-deformational recrystallization. The irregular distribution of interstitial troilite and chromite suggests that segregation of core material has been incipient retaining significant amounts of metal. One possible conclusion is that within small bodies like Vesta, even though deformation and differentiation were concomitant within a dynamic environment, differentiation was not efficient.",

The origin of this scattered energy is unclear and may provide valuable information about structure in the core. We use array analysis techniques to enhance the signal of theses scatterers and try and locate them. \nOur results show that the scattered energy originates along the great-circle path in a consistent range of arrival times and narrow range of ray parameter. There are no obvious variations with source or station location, in particular the depth of the source. After exploration of possible location for these scatterers, we show that their origin is most likely at the base of the outer-core, in the F-layer. \nTo assess our interpretation, we model synthetic seismograms and test velocity profiles in the F-layer. We suggest that such a layer may be responsible for the scattering in the PKP coda as observed in the data. The detection and observation of this scattered energy enables us to constrain physical properties of the F-layer that play an important role in the investigation of the geodynamo modelisation and core evolution.",

However, very few studies have examined the impact of ENMs on the natural soil-subsurface matrix and its properties. Potential irreversible changes to natural soil-subsurface systems that originate from contact with other chemical contaminants of anthropogenic origin have been noted previously. Such changes are considered to have a substantial impact on the liquid phase and solid matrix properties. ENMs reach the land surface through many pathways during and after their beneficial use. Once in the soil, ENMs move as suspended particles in aqueous solution. Dissolution, aggregation and deposition are the primary processes governing their interaction with the soil solid phase and their redistribution from the land surface to the groundwater. We argue that irreversible deposition of ENMs occurring under specific conditions (e.g., in arid and semi-arid environments) may lead to irreversible changes in soil matrix structure and properties. Results from our research on metal and metal oxides ENMs (e.g., CuO, Ag) and from literature on carbon based nanomaterials will be presented in support of our hypothesis.",

            "abstract": "Shared vocabularies are an important aid to geoscience data interoperability. Many organizations maintain useful vocabularies, with Geologic Surveys having a particularly long history of vocabulary and lexicon development. However, the mode of publication is heterogeneous, ranging from PDFs and HTML web pages, spreadsheets and CSV, through various user-interfaces and APIs. Update and maintenance ranges from tightly-governed and externally opaque, through various community processes, all the way to crowd-sourcing (‘folksonomies’). A general expectation, however, is for greater harmonization and vocabulary re-use. In order to be successful this requires (a) standardized content formalization and APIs (b) transparent content maintenance and versioning. We have been trialling a combination of software dealing with registration, search and linking.\nSKOS is designed for formalizing multi-lingual, hierarchical vocabularies, and has been widely adopted in earth and environmental sciences. SKOS is an RDF vocabulary, for which SPARQL is the standard low-level API. However, for interoperability between SKOS vocabulary sources, a SKOS-based API (i.e. based on the SKOS predicates prefLabel, broader, narrower, etc) is required. We have developed SISSvoc for this purpose, and used it to deploy a number of vocabularies on behalf of the IUGS, ICS, NERC, OGC, the Australian Government, and CSIRO projects. SISSvoc Search provides simple search UI on top of one or more SISSvoc sources.\nContent maintenance is composed of many elements, including content-formalization, definition-update, and mappings to related vocabularies. Typically there is a degree of expert judgement required. In order to provide confidence in users, two requirements are paramount: (i) once published, a URI that denotes a vocabulary item must remain dereferenceable; (ii) the history and status of the content denoted by a URI must be available. These requirements match the standard ‘registration’ paradigm which is implemented in the Linked Data Registry, which is currently used by WMO and the UK Environment Agency for publication of vocabularies.\nTogether, these components provide a powerful and flexible system for providing earth science vocabularies for the community, consistent with semantic web and linked-data principles.",

Here we concentrate on the much smaller short-period hydrological signals in the minutes-to-hours range, due to the direct attraction of very close water masses within some hundred meters from the gravity laboratory. This period range is interesting e.g. for SG observations of the gravity signature of deep earth processes, where the signal is very small, and a possible decrease in noise level obtained from hydrological modeling would be useful.\nAround the gravity laboratory at Metsähovi we have installed 12 arrays of soil moisture sensors at depths of 0.1 to 1 m below surface, three borehole wells to groundwater in the fractures of the crystalline bedrock, and 11 observation tubes into groundwater level in sediments, typically at 1 to 4 m depth below surface. Since January 2014 we record the snow water equivalent with a passive gamma ray device. However, a major component in local water mass remains inaccessible to these sensors. From earlier research we know that during summer months, even a major rainfall pulse is quickly removed from the surface layers of the soil by evapotranspiration, and frequently never reaches the depth of the soil moisture sensors; let alone the groundwater. Obviously, this also depends on the prior moisture state of the soil layers. But in any case the water mass is present for a while, and the input pulse is detectable not only by a rain gauge but also by an upward slope in the SG record.\nAt the laboratory we now have three superconducting gravity sensors: the SG T020 has been operating since 1994, and in February 2014 the new SG OSG-073 with two individual sensors was installed at two meters’ distance from the T020. The characteristics of the three sensors are different, and also the different locations influence slightly the gravity signal from variation in local masses. We present first results of the modeling of short-period gravity variation using all hydrological sensors, and compare them with the three SG gravity time series.",

            "abstract": "Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is a prominent intraseasonal variability in the tropics, which is characterized by eastward moving large-scale convective system along the equator. However their characteristics regard to their propagation paths, duration, and propagation speed varies from event to event. Here, 180 MJO events during 1979-2012 were identified applying Wheeler and Hendon’s (2004) Realtime Multivariative MJO index to 20-120 day Lanczos bandpass filtered NOAA Interpolated Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) data, and NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis1 daily mean horizontal wind data at 850hPa and 200hPa. Location of minimum OLR was tracked daily as MJO convection propagation path, and eastward propagation speed for each event was calculated. Eastward propagation speeds of detected MJOs varied from 2ms^-1 to 10ms^-1, with most events taking propagation speed in the 3ms^-1 to 5ms^-1 range. Further investigation of propagation speed in relation with the MJO event’s occurring latitude and months revealed that propagation speed of MJOs tends to be faster in spring and autumn, and slower in the winter and summer months. This aspect of MJO seasonality was examined in relation with seasonal change in SST distribution by analysis of daily mean NOAA OI SST V2 high resolution dataset. The result suggests that zonal gradient of SST from the equatorial Indian Ocean to equatorial Western Pacific, and equatorial symmetry of SST distribution may have influence on the behavior of MJOs.",

The seasonal distribution and synoptic distinction are important because they dictate differences in the thunderclouds macro- and microphysical properties and as a consequence determine their electrical activity.\nWe present analysis of ~185,000 lightning ground strokes detected by the Israeli Lightning Detection Network (operated by the Israeli Electrical Corporation) during CL and RST days along the period between October 2004 and December 2010. We find clear spatial and temporal differences in the numbers of strokes, peak current, stroke polarity and their diurnal cycle and in the spatial distributions between CL and RST synoptic settings.

            "abstract": "Using an active source of neutrons as an in situ probe of a planetary body has proven to be a powerful tool to extract information about the presence, abundance, and location of subsurface volatiles without the need for drilling. The Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons (DAN) instrument on Curiosity is an example of such an instrument and is designed to detect the location and abundance of hydrogen within the top 50 cm of the Martian surface. DAN works by sending a pulse of neutrons towards the ground beneath the rover and detecting the reflected neutrons. The intensity and time of arrival of the reflection depends on the proportion of water, while the time the pulse takes to reach the detector is a function of the depth at which the water is located. Similar instruments can also be effective probes at the polar-regions of the Moon or on asteroids as a way of detecting sequestered volatiles.\nWe present the results of GEANT4 particle simulation models of gamma ray, fast, epithermal, and thermal neutron responses to active neutron illumination. The results are parameterized by hydrogen abundance, stratification and depth of volatile layers, versus the distribution of neutron and gamma ray energy reflections. Models will be presented to approximate Martian, lunar, and asteroid environments and would be useful tools to assess utility for future NASA exploration missions to these types of planetary bodies.",

            "abstract": "The attenuation caused to the seismic wave during its propagation can be mainly divided into two parts, the scattering and the intrinsic attenuation.\nThe scattering is an elastic redistribution of the energy due to the medium heterogeneities. However the intrinsic attenuation is an inelastic phenomenon, mainly due to the fluid-grain friction during the wave passage. The intrinsic attenuation is directly related to the physical characteristics of the medium, so this parameter is very can be used for media characterization and fluid detection, which is beneficial for the oil and gas industry.\nThe intrinsic attenuation is estimated by subtracting the scattering from the total attenuation, therefore the accuracy of the intrinsic attenuation is directly dependent on the accuracy of the total attenuation and the scattering. The total attenuation can be estimated from the recorded waves, by using in-situ methods as the spectral ratio and frequency shift methods. The scattering is estimated by assuming the heterogeneities as a succession of stacked layers, each layer is characterized by a single density and velocity.\nThe accuracy of the scattering is strongly dependent on the layer thicknesses, especially in the case of the media composed of carbonate rocks, such media are known for their strong heterogeneity. Previous studies gave some assumptions for the choice of the layer thickness, but they showed some limitations especially in the case of carbonate rocks. In this study we established a relationship between the layer thicknesses and the frequency of the propagation, after certain mathematical development of the Generalized O’Doherty-Anstey formula. We validated this relationship through some synthetic tests and real data provided from a VSP carried out over an onshore oilfield in the emirate of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, primarily composed of carbonate rocks.\nThe results showed the utility of our relationship for an accurate estimation of the scattering, and even for other application related to fine layering effect, as to determine the averaging window length for the upscaling method, Backus averaging.",

            "abstract": "The mass-47 clumped isotope thermometer allows one to elucidate the temperature of carbonate formation and avoids speculation about the composition of precipitating water and/or oxygen composition of another mineral phase, as is required for conventional stable isotope thermometry. Recent studies have tried to reconstruct surface paleotemperatures to resolve paleoclimate or paleoelevation using this technique. Mass-47 measured from carbonates preserved in the geologic record; however, are potentially affected by burial and/or diagenetic alteration. These effects are poorly understood. Here we investigate the effect of burial on the ∆-47 composition of lacustrine carbonates. We collected samples, on the surface and recovered from drill cores, from two regions in the greater Green River Basin (Wyoming), the Washakie Basin and the Pinedale Anticline. Both basins were filled with thick, continuous Cretaceous – Eocene lacustrine strata. From these two sections, lacustrine carbonates were sampled over a paleodepth range of 1–6 km.\nThe ∆-47 compositions of the carbonates have been measured over the first two kilometers of depth and the clumped temperatures compared with peak temperatures estimated from vitrinite reflectance, fluid inclusion thermometry and basin thermal models. Although slightly warmer than MAT estimates from Eocene paleosol geochemistry (~24°C), clumped isotope temperatures are consistently ~40°C across this depth range, similar to clumped-isotope paleotemperature estimates for the Eocene Bighorn Basin. Peak temperatures of the carbonate samples reached 120°C, while modern downhole temperatures of the deepest samples are 50°C.\nThese results suggest that the ∆-47 thermometer preserves a record of surficial temperatures during Eocene time and that the ∆-47 thermometry is not apparently affected by burial to temperatures of at least 120°C. Effects of burial to greater depths (~6 km) and higher temperatures (~200°C) is in progress to evaluate the robustness of the ∆-47 thermometer at preserving surficial temperatures under these conditions.",

Under the southward IMF, dayside magnetic reconnection leads to a penetration of magnetic flux and energy into the magnetosphere. The magnetic flux and energy are then transported to the magnetotail, which leads to a current sheet thinning and subsequent magnetotail reconnection with multiple X-lines. The magnetotail reconnection is typical collisionless fast reconnection with Hall effect included. Multiple small-scale highly 3-D FRs are generated through the multiple X-lines reconnection. Both of the tailward and earthward moving FRs are observed in the near-tail plasma sheet, and detailed structure and evolution of the FRs are investigated. Coalescence between the FRs can also be observed during the evolution, which leads to the ion parallel heating inside the newly generated FRs. The ion velocity distributions and energy spectra show that the ions are accelerated in the vicinity of the reconnection X-lines. On the other hand, the ions are heated in the FRs and reconnection high-speed outflows.",

Vertical displacements recorded at continuous stations of the Global Positionning System (cGPS) are fairly well predicted as the response of an elastic spherical and layered model to large variations of continental water storage. Here we investigate deviations from this model in a more realistic elastic-viscous Earth. We use a spectral method to compute displacements at the surface of a spherical elastically-layered lithosphere resting on a viscous asthenosphere, imposing a surface load derived from the Gravity and Recovery Climate experiment (GRACE) equivalent water height data. The model predicts a phase lag of several tens of days between a purely eastic response and a visco-elastic one for viscosities less than about 10x10^18 Pa.s. This time lag is most prominent in the horizontal components and for loads of spherical harmonic degrees 10-20. Vertical displacements are only weakly sensitive to the presence of a viscous asthenosphere. We validate this model by observational data sets in regions of significant seasonal loading variations and low asthenospheric viscosity.",

            "abstract": "The Arabian Peninsula is one of the Earth’s major sources of atmospheric dust. Along with profound negative effects on human activity and natural processes in this region, dust is an important nutrient source for the oligothrophic northern Red Sea. From preliminary observations it is estimated that some 18-20 major dust storms per year deposit about 6 Mt of mineral dust into the Red Sea. To better understand the optical properties, health, and ecological impacts of dust, we study the mineralogical, chemical and morphological properties of surface soil samples collected at prevbiously identified potential dust sources along the Arabian coast of the Red Sea. Many of these dust sources lie within a narrow coastal region and because of their proximity to the Red Sea, are important contributors to the dust/nutrient balance, during both dusty and fair weather conditions. Bulk samples were collected from the top 10 mm of soils from three sites along the Arabian coast of the Red Sea. The soil samples were sieved to separate the < 38µm particle fractions for chemical and mineralogical analysis. X-ray diffractometry (XRD) was applied to measure the mineral content of the dust. The chemical composition of individual particles was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). From the XRD analysis of the sieved samples from An Masayat (23.3322 N, 38.9481 E), Buthna (23.2960 N, 38.9384 E) and Rabugh pipeline Road (23.292 N, 38.91 E), it was found that the dust was composed largely of hematite, goethite, calcite, dolomite, quartz, chlorite, muscovite, amphibole, epidote and plagioclase. Our results are being compared to, and show similarities to those of Engelbrecht et al. , collected at 15 Middle East sites. Both the mineralogical content and chemical composition of samples bear the signatures of the regional geology. Engelbrecht, J. P., McDonald, E. V., Gillies, J. A., Jayanty, R. K.

            "abstract": "Aqueous phase chemistry might be responsible for the formation of a significant fraction of the organic aerosol (OA) observed in the atmosphere, and could explain some of the discrepancies between OA concentration and properties predicted by models and observed in the environment.\nAerosol - fog interaction and its effect on submicron aerosol properties were investigated in the Po Valley (northern Italy) during fall 2011, in the framework of the Supersite project (ARPA Emilia Romagna). Composition and physical properties of submicron aerosol were measured online by a High Resolution- Time of Flight – Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-TOF-AMS), a Soot Photometer – Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (SP-AMS), and a Tandem Differential Mobility Particle Sizer (TDMPS). Organic functional group analysis was performed off-line by Hydrogen - Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (H-NMR) spectrometry and by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometry. Aerosol absorption, scattering, and total extinction were measured simultaneously with a Particle Soot Absorption Photometer (PSAP), a Nephelometer, and a Cavity Attenuated Phase Shift Spectrometer particle extinction monitor (CAPS PMex), respectively. Water-soluble organic carbon in fog-water was characterized off-line by HR-TOF-AMS.\nFourteen distinct fog events were observed. Fog dissipation left behind an aerosol enriched in particles larger than 400 nm, typical of fog and cloud processing, and dominated by secondary species, including ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate and oxidized OA (OOA). Source apportionment of OA allowed us to identify OOA as the difference between total OA and primary OA (hydrocarbon like OA and biomass burning OA). The formation of OOA through fog processing is proved by the correlation of OOA concentration with hydroxyl methyl sulfonate signal and by the similarity of OOA spectra with organic mass spectra obtained by re-aerosolization of fog water samples. The oxygen to carbon ratio and the hydrogen to carbon ratio of this OOA fraction was about 0.6 and 1.3, respectively. Organic functional group analysis showed that OOA observed after fog dissipation was characterized by organic-sulfur and organic-nitrogen species.",

            "abstract": "Wave-influenced deltas are shaped by wave-driven transport of river-borne sediments. Near the river mouth, combined jet and wave dynamics, along with morphodynamic feedbacks, control the fraction of sediment transported alongshore by littoral currents that can bypass the river channel. Here we study how different bypassing rates influence large-scale delta evolution and examine the effect of waves and the river mouth jet on alongshore sediment bypassing.\nFirst, we use a modified version of the Coastline Evolution Model (CEM) to look at the effects of wave climate, fluvial sediment supply, and alongshore sediment bypassing rates on channel orientation. This modified version of CEM progrades the channel in a direction perpendicular to the local shoreline orientation at the river mouth, allowing feedbacks between alongshore sediment transport and fluvial sediment delivery to steer the river channel. Additionally, we allow a prescribed fraction of littoral sediment to bypass the river mouth. We find that deltas that have a large fluvial sediment flux can orient themselves into the direction of dominant wave approach. Lower fluvial inputs result in channels that are deflected downdrift, with increasing deflection as bypassing is reduced. In contrast, channels do not deflect downdrift (but can reorient themselves updrift for large fluvial fluxes) when full bypassing is allowed. These results demonstrate the importance of river mouth sediment bypassing on delta growth patterns, but, as we explore arbitrary bypassing laws, the simulations cannot help us constrain natural bypassing fluxes.\nTo further investigate the natural extent and mechanisms of bypassing, we use the coupled hydrodynamic and morphodynamic model Delft3D-SWAN. With a simplified shoreface and river channel, the model is able to construct river mouth morphology from the combined action of alongshore transport and a river mouth jet. Exploring river mouth morphology and sediment bypassing under various wave and fluvial conditions, we find that bypassing rates can be highly variable, and strongly depend on jet stability, fluvial sediment properties and inlet geometry. Waves increase jet spreading and promote jet deflection, and can help create an efficient bypassing regime through morphodynamic feedbacks that involve bar creation and elongation.",

            "abstract": "Earth’s magnetic field is thought to be sustained by dynamo action in a convecting metallic outer core since at least 3.45 Ga (Tarduno et al., 2010). Convection induces an isentropic temperature gradient that drains 13±3 TW of heat from the core by thermal conduction (de Koker et al., 2012; Pozzo et al., 2012; Gomi et al., 2013), and suggests that Earth’s core has cooled by ∼1,000 K or more since Earth’s formation (Gomi et al., 2013). However, models of Earth’s initial thermal evolution following a giant-impact predict rapid cooling to the mantle melting temperature (e.g., Solomatov, 2007).\nIn order to understand how the core could have retained enough heat to explain the age of the geodynamo, we relax a key assumption of the basal magma ocean model of (Labrosse et al., 2007) to allow for the possibility that the magma is stably stratified. Recent giant impact simulations suggest extensive core-mantle mixing (Saitoh and Makino, 2013), which could have produced such a large stratified magma layer at the core-mantle boundary.\nIn the presence of a stable density gradient, heat transfer through the basal magma ocean occurs through conduction and therefore delays heat loss from the core. Partitioning of iron in the liquid phase upon crystallization changes the density profile and triggers convection in the upper part of the basal magma ocean. Our hypothesis suggests that early core cooling is dominated by the diffusion timescale through the basal magma ocean, and predicts a delayed onset of the geodynamo (i.e, during the late Headean/early Archean). This model can therefore be falsified if the existence of a geomagnetic field can be inferred from magnetization of inclusions in Hadean zircons.\nN. de Koker et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.

            "abstract": "Field data on evapotranspiration are of crucial importance for ecohydrological and hydrometeorological studies in the tropics. Probably the most direct way to measure evapotranspiration is with the eddy covariance method, in which the latent heat flux (λE) is calculated from turbulent fluctuations of vertical wind velocity and humidity. The humidity fluctuations are typically measured with some type of fast-response infrared hygrometer. However, these sensors are expensive, which can be problematic if research budgets are limited. Turbulent fluctuations of humidity can also be measured with fast-response dry- and wet-bulb thermocouples, which can be constructed easily and at a fraction of the price of infrared sensors. The idea of using dry- and wet-bulb thermocouples for measuring λE with the eddy covariance method is not new, but hasn't been tested recently, possibly because experiments in the late seventies showed that this approach is not without problems due to the slow response of the wet-bulb thermocouple. In the present study, values of λE derived from dry- and wet-bulb thermocouple measurements were compared with those obtained using a fast-response KH20 hygrometer. Measurements were made above a shaded coffee plantation and a sugarcane crop in central Veracruz, Mexico. The agreement between λE obtained with the thermocouples (y) and the hygrometer (x) was very good for both vegetation covers: y = 0.98x + 5.0 (W m-2), r2 = 0.93 (coffee plantation); y = 0.99x – 13.3 (W m-2), r2 = 0.88 (sugarcane). However, the correction factor (CF) for high frequency loss in the wet-bulb temperature signal was considerably higher for the low-statured sugarcane crop (CF = 1.33) as compared to the taller shaded coffee plantation (CF = 1.09). Nevertheless, as long as care is taken in the derivation of this correction factor, reliable λE data can be obtained using the dry- and wet-bulb thermocouples, offering a cheap alternative to infrared hygrometers.",

It is surrounded by land on three sides, separating a northern volcanic province from metamorphic rocks to the south and west, and ophiolites to the southeast. Recently acquired multibeam bathymetry and 2D seismic data suggest a link between core complex exhumation on land and offshore subsidence driven by major young extension.\nIn western Gorontalo Bay are two sub-basins with different histories: Tomini Basin in the north and Poso Basin in the south. In Tomini Basin six major seismic sequences (Units A to F) have a total thickness over 5 sec TWT. Ages are based on interpreted correlations with events on land. Basement Unit A subsided from the Early Miocene, with deposition of Units B and C, largely in a deep marine environment. There was regional uplift in the Middle Miocene. Carbonate platforms were thereafter deposited in shallow marine environments (Units D-E). The platforms show a wedge geometry that suggests tilting of the basin during their deposition. Subsidence accelerated during the deposition of Unit E in the Early Pliocene, causing backstepping of the shelf edge, formation of pinnacle reefs and then drowning of the carbonate platforms, leading to present depths of 2 km in the basin centre (Unit F).\nPoso Basin is younger than Tomini Basin and forms the southern part of western Gorontalo Bay. The deeper part of its sedimentary sequence is probably the time equivalent of Unit D in Tomini Basin. It contains a complex deformed sequence of sediments, up to 3 sec TWT, that are the probable equivalent of Units E and F to the north. On land to the south of Poso Basin is a large metamorphic core complex. Seismic data suggest that the northern flank of the complex can be traced into a potential low angle normal fault under the basin that caused subsidence offshore. Low T thermochronology and alluvial sediment records on land suggest major uplift and subsidence occurred in the Pliocene.",

            "abstract": "River managers need practical tools to promote appropriately hyporheic functions in restoration schemes. Hyporheic ecosystems are largely controlled by hydrological processes, which may be simulated through physically-based models. Despite their apparent limitations (sophisticated, data-hungry, and computationally demanding), these models offer substantial advantages that may pertain to the operational level of river management: representation of specific landscapes, process-based sensitivity analyses, and alternative restoration scenario testing. This presentation builds on idealized and field-based studies, as well as literature examples, to discuss how physically-based models of hyporheic exchange can be fully exploited for restoration purposes. Results suggest that these models are best suited to map spatial patterns of exchange at the sediment-water interface, rather than to estimate HEF fluxes and residence times. Because subsurface data are typically unavailable or sparse, an approach combining high-resolution topographic data combined with a sensitivity analysis appears as a promising approach for: (a) delineating potential areas of upwelling and downwelling along longitudinal and lateral channel sections; and (b) highlighting potential differences in HEF characteristics between reaches. To achieve satisfactory simulations, however, the challenge lies in the topographic representation of the channel and the discretization of the mesh. Here, common pitfalls are identified, and guidance to overcome these is provided.",

            "abstract": "Fluids have long been suggested to play an important role in slow earthquake generation. High pore-pressures that lower the effective normal stress where slow earthquakes occur are due to a build-up of metamorphic fluids that are trapped at the plate interface. We analyze a low-frequency earthquake (LFE) catalog of unprecedented density to study the response of the Guerrero subduction to a Mw 7.5 slow-slip event (SSE). About half-way through the SSE, we observe a significant deceleration of LFE activity in the deep part of the subduction that then propagates towards the trench over a series of several weeks. We also investigate the recurrence of LFE bursts as a function of distance from the trench and find that the LFE recurrence decreases with increasing distance from the trench before the SSE. During the six month-long SSE, however, the LFE burst recurrence is uniform across ~80 km. Taking into consideration these two observations, we suggest that plate interface permeability is significantly increased during the SSE and a large-scale fluid migration towards the trench takes place along the subduction interface. Sustained fluid migration over the first half of the SSE eventually drains the plate interface in the downdip slow earthquakes source region. The reduced pore-pressure of the drained plate interface, and the consequent increase of effective normal stress, significantly reduces the LFE activity. After the SSE, fluid pressure is then recharged from the surrounding area over several months. This proposed large-scale fluid migration mechanism explains our observations and also provides a source for episodic fluid discharges during megathrust events updip in the seismogenic zone.",

            "abstract": "The Darwinian modeling approach seeks to explain the behavior of a hydrologic system as a whole by identifying simple and robust temporal or spatial patterns that capture the relevant processes. Darwinian-based hydrologic models include the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) curve number model, the “abcd” model, and the Budyko-type models. However, these models were developed based on widely differing principles and assumptions and applied to distinct time scales. Here, we derive a one-parameter Budyko-type model for mean annual water balance which is based on a generalization of the proportionality hypothesis of the SCS model and therefore is independent of temporal scale. Furthermore, we show that the new model is equivalent to the key equation of the “abcd” model. Theoretical lower and upper bounds of the new model are identified and validated based on previous observations. Thus, we illustrate a time-scale invariance property in water balance, which allows for synthesis with the Newtonian approach and offers opportunities for progress in hydrologic modeling.\nIn the derivation of Budyko equation, total evaporation is divided into initial evaporation (E0) and continuing evaporation. Runoff does not compete with initial evaporation for water storage by interception and top soils. The assumption behind the derived equation is that the ratio of continuing evaporation to its potential value is equal to the ratio of runoff to the maximum possible value of runoff. The derived equation satisfies the boundary conditions of Budyko hypothesis, and includes one parameter (ε). From the perspective of evaporation, is the ratio between initial evaporation and total evaporation; from the soil wetting (W) perspective, e can be interpreted as the ratio between initial evaporation ratio (λ =E0/W) and Horton index (H=E/W), i.e. ε =λ/H. H is dominantly controlled by vegetation represented by NDVI; l is found to increase with decreasing product between NDVI and the fraction of rainy days.",

            "abstract": "It has been reported that conversion of intensively cultivated lands to less disturbed systems enhances soil OM storage capacity, primarily through OM stabilization in macroaggregates. We hypothesized that the potential for OM stabilization inside macro-aggregates is influenced by presence and abundance of intra-aggregate pores. Pores determine microbial access to OM and regulate diffusion of solution/gases within aggregates which drives microbial functioning. We investigated the influence of longterm disturbance intensity on soil OM composition and its relation to pore size distribution within macroaggregates. We used quantitative FTIR to determine OM decomposition status and X-ray micro-tomography to assess pore size distribution in macroaggregates as affected by management and landuse. Macroaggregates 4-6 mm in size where selected from topsoil under long term conventional tillage (CT), cover-crop (CC), and native succession vegetation (NS) treatments at Kellogg Biological Station, Michigan. Comparison of main soil OM functional groups suggested that with increasing disturbance intensity, the proportion of aromatic and carboxylic/carbohydrates associated compounds increased and it was concomitant with a decrease in the proportion of aliphatic associated compounds and lignin derivatives. Further, FTIR-based decomposition indices revealed that overall decomposition status of macroaggregates followed the pattern of CT > CC ≈ NS. X-ray micro-tomography findings suggested that greater OM decomposition within the macroaggregates was associated with i) greater percent of pores >13 micron in size within the aggregates, as well as ii) greater proportion of small to medium pores (13-110 micron). The results develop previous findings, suggesting that shift in landuse or management indirectly affects soil OM stabilization through alteration of pore size distribution within macroaggregates that itself, is coupled with OM decomposition status.",

            "abstract": "Microlites in pyroclasts have been intensively studied to understand magma　ascent processes. However, microlites do not record the explosive-effusive transitions in sub-Plinian eruptions when such transitions are governed by the shallow level degassing rather than by the magma ascent rate. To overcome this limitation, we studied the “nanolites” in the quenched products of the 2011 Shinmoedake, Kirishima Volcanic Group, Kyusyu Japan1. Nanolites are the nanometer-scale components of the groundmass minerals and exhibit a steeper slope of crystal size distribution than that of the microlites2. In the 2011 Shinmoedake eruption, the style of activity had undergone transformations from sub-Plinian eruption to Vulcanian explosion and intermittent effusion of lava3. We found that, although the products formed by different eruptive activities have similar microlite characteristics, such products can be distinguished clearly by their mineral assemblage of nanolites. The samples of pumices of sub-Plinian eruptions and Vulcanian explosions and the dense juvenile fragments of lava (in descending order of explosivity) contained, respectively, nanolites of low-Ca pyroxene, low-Ca pyroxene + plagioclase, and low-Ca pyroxene + plagioclase + Fe-Ti oxides. Nanolites are assumed to crystallize when undercooling of the magma due primarily to dehydration increases rapidly near the surface. The water contents of the interstitial glass indicate that the quenched depths did not differ greatly between eruption styles. Hence, the different nanolite assemblages of each eruption style are assumed to have resulted from differences in magma residence time near the surface. Thus, we propose that nanolites in pyroclasts have the potential to indicate the physicochemical conditions of magma at the transition points of eruption styles.\n",

In order to better understand the imbibition process, wave velocity evolution caused by spontaneous imbibition is studied through experimental investigation.\nOne shale sample comes from an outcrop located in Chongqing named as Cls. The other is YC8, 833.33 meters’ depth of Yucan-8 gas well. All samples were cored and polished to cylinders of 25mm in diameter and 50mm in length. After sample preparation, they are dried at 90ºC temperature in an oven-drying for 24 hours.Firstly, samples are saturated with distilled water and n-decane for 24 hours and 48hours respectively, for comparison with the dry samples. After the long-time imbibition,a uniaxial test is conducted at a constant stress rate of 2MPa/minute up to 30MPa. The compressional wave velocities are measured along the longitudinal direction with a classic ultrasonic pulse transmission technique. Arrival times are auto-picked using waveform cross-correlation method. The results are as follows:\n1 It is found that significant velocity evolution difference exists between the two shale samples. Water imbibition makes the velocities of Cls lower than that of the dry one. However YC8 shale samples have opposite properties. Theses could not be explained by Gassmann equation and hence needs further research.\n2 Stress sensitivity of water saturated Cls sample is larger but in the same order compared with that of the dry one. Maybe It is the response of induced cracks by the water-clay interaction. As to YC8,the stress sensitivities of dry and saturated are nearly the same.\n3 n-decane saturation experiment is also conducted on two shale samples. The velocities of saturated Cls shale are larger than that of the dry ones which is different with the water saturation condition. As to YC8, the results are almost the same as water saturated condition.\n4 The velocity of Cls shale is caused by physical and chemical effects, but that of YC8 shale only physical effect. Gassmann effect can not represent all the physical effects. Fluid saturation effects can be divided into microscale effect and Gassmann effect, micro-scale effect is relevant to surface area,initial saturation, micro-wettability, capillary force.",

            "abstract": "Orbiting planetary laser altimeters have provided critical data on such bodies as the Earth, Mars, the Moon, Mercury, and 433 Eros. The measurement accuracy of these instruments depends on accurate knowledge of not only the position and attitude of the spacecraft, but also the pointing of the altimeter with respect to the spacecraft coordinate system. To that end, we have carried out several experiments to measure post-launch instrument characteristics for the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) onboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. In these experiments, the spacecraft points away from the Moon and scans the Earth in a raster pattern as the LOLA laser fires (the downlink) while a ground station on Earth fires its own laser to the spacecraft (the uplink). The downlink pulse arrival times and digitized waveforms are recorded at the ground station, the Goddard Geophysical and Astronomical Observatory in Greenbelt, MD, and the uplink arrival times and pulse widths are measured by LOLA. From early in the mission, the experiments have helped to confirm a pointing anomaly when LOLA is facing towards deep space or the cold side of the Moon. Under these conditions, the downlink data indicate a laser bore-sight pointing offset of about -400 and 100 microradians in the cross-track and along-track directions, respectively. These corrections are consistent with an analysis of LOLA ground-track crossovers spread throughout the mission to determine lunar tidal flexure. The downlink data also allow the reconstruction of the laser far-field pattern. From the uplink data, we estimate a correction to the receiver telescope nighttime pointing of ~140 microradians in the cross-track direction. By comparing data from such experiments shortly after launch and nearly 5 years later, we have directly measured the changes in the laser characteristics and obtained critical data to understand the laser behavior and refine the instrument calibration.",

            "abstract": "In June thru September, 2013, a 3D reflection and a long offset seismic experiment were conducted at the Galicia rifted margin by investigators from the US, UK, Germany, and Spain. The 3D multichannel experiment covered 64 km by 20 km (1280 km2), using the RV Marcus Langseth. Four streamers 6 km long were deployed at 12.5 m hydrophone channel spacing. The streamers were 200 m apart. Two airgun arrays, each 3300 cu in, were fired alternately every 37.5 m, to collectively yield a 400 m wide sail line consisting of 8 CMP lines at 50 m spacing. The long offset seismic experiment included 72 short period OBS’s deployed below the 3D reflection survey box. Most of the instruments recorded all the shots from the airgun array shots.\nThe 3D seismic box covered a variety of geologic features. The Peridotite Ridge (PR), is associated with the exhumation of upper mantle rocks to the seafloor during the final stage of the continental separation between the Galicia Bank and the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. The S reflector is present below most of the continental blocks under the deep Galicia basin. S is interpreted to be a low-angle detachment fault formed late in the rifting process, and a number of rotated fault block basins and ranges containing pre and syn-rift sediments.\nInitial observations from stacked 3D seismic data, and samples of 2D pre-stack time migrated (PSTM) 3D seismic data show that the PR is elevated above the present seafloor in the South and not exposed through the seafloor in the North. The relative smoothness of the PR surface for the entire 20 km N-S contrasts with the more complex, shorter wavelength, faulting of the continental crustal blocks to the east. The PR does not seem to show offsets or any apparent internal structure. The PSTM dip lines show substantial improvement for the structures in the deep sedimentary basin East of the PR. These seem to extend the S reflector somewhat farther to the West. The migrated data show a substantial network of clear normal faults in the sediments well after the postrift period.",

            "abstract": "Fluid compressibility is known to be an important, non-negligible component of the dynamics of many planetary atmospheres and stellar convection zones, yet imposes severe computational constraints on numerical simulations of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations (NSE). An often employed reduced form of the NSE are the anelastic equations, which maintain fluid compressibility in the form of a depth varying, adiabatic background state onto which the perturbations cannot feed back. We present the linear theory of compressible rotating convection in a local-area, plane layer geometry. An important dimensionless parameter in convection is the ratio of kinematic viscosity to thermal diffusivity, or the Prandtl number, Pr. It is shown that the anelastic approximation cannot capture the linear instability of gases with Prandtl numbers less than approximately 0.5 in the limit of rapid rotation; the time derivative of the density fluctuation appearing in the conservation of mass equation remains important for these cases and cannot be neglected. An alternative compressible, geostrophically balanced equation set has been derived and preliminary results utilizing this new equation set are presented. Notably, this new set of equations satisfies the Proudman-Taylor theorem on small axial scales even for strongly compressible flows, does not require the flow to be nearly adiabatic, and thus allows for feedback onto the background state.",

            "abstract": "Understanding of nitrogen cycling on continental shelves, a critical component of global nutrient cycling, is often hampered by limited observations compared to the strong variability apparent on relatively small time and space scales. Numerical models are able to partially alleviate this issue by filling temporal and spatial data gaps and hence resolving annual area-integrated nutrient fluxes. Here a land-ocean-biogeochemical modeling system was implemented to simulate the nitrogen budget during 2004-2007 on the U.S. eastern continental shelf. Quantitative model skill assessment was conducted via extensive comparisons to satellite observations, and in situ data where available. Model simulations demonstrate that denitrification and burial fluxes have pronounced seasonal variation but change little from year to year. In contrast, annual net community production (NCP) varies significantly between years, but overall is positive indicating a net autotrophic system. Whereas the advective influx of nitrogen from the bays and rivers on the western boundary of the shelf changes only slightly among the four years examined, the advective fluxes across the eastern and northern boundaries change dramatically. These changes are associated with changes in the positions of the relatively high-nutrient Labrador Sea waters advecting into the shelf from the north, and the relatively low-nutrient Gulf Stream waters advecting into the region from the southeast. Tests varying the initial conditions (reduced spin-up) and simplifying the modeled plankton structure showed distinct impacts on these nitrogen fluxes: the former strongly affected the advective fluxes, but had little impact on denitrification, burial or NCP, whereas the latter significantly reduced denitrification, burial, and NCP but did not significantly impact the advective fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Understanding statistical properties of earthquake sources is crucial for proper ground-motion predictions. We investigate the size distribution of slip values as imaged by finite-fault rupture models. Our analysis utilizes rupture models from the SRCMOD database (\nhttp://equake-rc.info/srcmod\n). To overcome the limitation of variable spatial sampling across different models, we consider combined areas of fault-rupture corresponding to different slip bins. The slip values in each rupture model are binned according to fractions of the overall maximum slip. We refer to the rupture area occupied by a specified slip bin as slip-area. To eliminate possible spurious small slip at the fault edge, we compute the effective source dimensions from the slip distribution, accounting for sub-fault size, location of slip-asperities, and surface rupture (if present). This procedure includes trimming the model to the smallest dimensions that accommodate the autocorrelation width of the slip distribution (Mai and Beroza, 2000). We modify the trimming process to not affect any large slip asperity (u ≥ umax/3) where u and umax denote slip and maximum slip value. In order to look beyond individual models, we develop scaling relationships between seismic moment and slip-areas. These relationships are, thereafter, employed to derive average tail distribution (or exceedance) of the slip values. Our regression analysis reveals that self-similar source scaling holds for dip-slip events while scale invariance breaks down for large strike-slip events. We find that the tail distributions of the slip values can be described by stretched-exponential functions, with the averaged distribution close to exponential. This characterization of the slip distribution agrees with the source scaling laws, and will be useful in generating realistic earthquake rupture scenarios for ground-motion modeling.",

            "abstract": "This study introduces a new inversion approach for simultaneous retrieval and optimal fusion of multi-sensor passive/active precipitation spaceborne observations relevant to the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) constellation of satellites. This approach uses a modern Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) Bayesian estimator and variational principles to obtain a robust estimate of the rainfall profile from multiple sources of observationally- and physically-based a priori generated databases. The MAP estimator makes use of a constrained mixed and -norm regularization that warranties improved stability and reduced estimation error compared to the classic least-squares estimators, often used in the Bayesian rainfall retrieval techniques. We demonstrate the promise of our framework via detailed algorithmic implementation using the passive and active multi-sensor observations provided by the microwave imager (TMI) and precipitation radar (PR) aboard the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite. To this end, we simultaneously obtain an observationally-driven retrieval of the entire precipitation profile using the coincidental TMI-PR observations and then optimally combine it with a first guess derived from physically-consistent a priori collected database of the TMI-2A12 operational product. We elucidate the performance of our algorithm for a wide range of storm environments with a specific focus on extreme and light precipitation events over land and coastal areas for hydrologic applications. The results are also validated versus the ground based observations and the standard TRMM products in seasonal and annual timescales.",

            "abstract": "We present new data for stable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios in four test-size ranges for Neogloboquadrina dutertrei from the EEP, and from four foraminifer species on RGR: Globorotalia menardii, Globorotalia truncatulinoides, Globorotalia inflata and Globigerinoides conglobatus. The EEP has a steep gradient to environmental parameters allowing statistical analyses of the effect of habitat and test size on shell chemistry. The RGR permits isolating the effect of sedimentary dissolution on shell chemistry because there is a strong gradient to sedimentary calcite dissolution there while surface environmental parameters remain invariable among core tops. Our statistical analyses include ANOVA, matched pair and independent means t-tests, univariate and multiple linear regression, principle components, and geographic distribution analyses. Calcite dissolution is estimated using the G. menardiiFragmentation Index.\nStable isotope data from small N. dutertrei shells (< 350µm) provide more accurate, statistically significant, and consistent estimates of environmental parameters than larger foraminifers. Temperature estimates made from stable oxygen isotopes disagree with those made with Mg/Ca with large and statistically significant differences (up to 4°C) using the same species, in the same core top samples and within the same test-size ranges. Previous studies have shown the strong effect of dissolution in modifying Mg/Ca content of foraminifer tests. While there is no statistically significant evidence on RGR that dissolution modifies stable isotope ratios in foraminifer shells; in EEP core tops we observe a strong and statistically significant relationship between dissolution and shell stable isotope chemistry. Geographic analyses and radiocarbon data suggest that sediments experiencing much dissolution can be as old as 9000 years, and there is a linear and statistically significant relationship between degree of dissolution and core top sediment age. The greater the dissolution, the older the sediment. Therefore, environmental inferences from shell chemistry are not comparable to modern environmental parameters, and dissolution indirectly confounds the accurate interpretation of shell stable isotope data while directly altering the Mg/Ca content of foraminifer shells.",

Moraine-dammed lakes are capable of impounding volumes of water in excess of 107 m3, and often represent a very real threat to downstream communities and infrastructure, should the bounding moraine fail and produce a catastrophic Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF). Modelling the individual components of a GLOF, including a triggering event, the complex dam-breaching process and downstream propagation of the flood is incredibly challenging, not least because direct observation and instrumentation of such high-magnitude flows is virtually impossible. We briefly review the current state-of-the-art in numerical GLOF modelling, with a focus on the theoretical and computational challenges associated with reconstructing or predicting GLOF dynamics in the face of rates of cryospheric change that have no historical precedent, as well as various implications for researchers and professionals tasked with the production of hazard maps and disaster mitigation strategies.",

The data were collected in 2009 by a Belgian-Russian-Japanese consortium, using a 50 kHz Seabeam 1050 echosounder, operated from RV Titov. The data cover the entire lake floor –in water depths between 200 m and 1637 m– of the Southern and Central Basins, i.e. a total surface of 15,000 km2.\nOur analysis revealed the presence of 26 possible underwater landslides. At least 11 of these are characterized by distinctive headwalls, scars and overall morphology, and were confirmed to be mass-wasting features by high-resolution reflection seismic data.\nMost of the identified underwater landslides scar the slopes of the Selenga river delta, and the sediment-charged slopes of the shoaling eastern margin of the half-graben basins.\nMost of the underwater landslides have a headwall occurring at water depths between 300 and 450 m; only a few occur at larger water depths.\nAll underwater landslides occur in areas in which gas hydrates have been inferred (i.e. based on the observation of bottom-simulating reflections on seismic data) or confirmed (i.e. by deep drilling or shallow coring). The clustering of many headwalls at a water depth that is not characterized by any distinct change in slope gradient or stratigraphy, but that is close to the stability limit of gas hydrates (i.e. ca. 380 m, for pure methane hydrates, under Lake Baikal conditions), suggests that the presence of the hydrates may be one of the most important controlling factors in conditioning the underwater slopes of Lake Baikal and rendering them unstable and prone to failure. The exact conditioning process remains, however, unclear as the hydrate reservoir in Lake Baikal is considered to have remained stable, even over relatively long time scales, in the absence of any important fluctuations in lake-level and in bottom-water temperature.",

Existing theories explaining coexistence focus on competitive relations or disturbances preventing the system from attaining a state with complete grass or tree dominance. The effect of hydraulic lift on interactions between woody plants and grasses and the dynamics of savanna ecosystems remains poorly understood. Here, we develop a mechanistic model to investigate the role of hydraulic lift on the stability of savannas. The model accounts both for competition for soil water in the shallow soil layer and fire-induced disturbance. We find that hydraulic lift expands the parameter range in which savannas are stable at the expense of woodlands. Our study shows that hydraulic lift can be an important mechanism responsible for coexistence of woody plants and grasses in savannas.",

            "abstract": "The ROSETTA mission has reached the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in early August, allowing a detailed mapping of its surface with the onboard OSIRIS imaging system, up to resolutions of 50 cm or even better in some areas. Shape reconstruction techniques have been used since July 2014 to build a very detailed 3D model of the comet surface and to retrieve highly accurate rotational parameters. The attached Figure shows an early 3D shape of the comet.\nThe most striking property of the global shape is the presence of two clearly separated components. We use a combination of images and 3D models to quantitatively characterize their bulk and surface properties: relative position, volume, topography and roughness. The position of the center of mass and the direction of the principal axis of rotation are used to constrain the internal mass distribution. Digital terrain models, slope, gravity, and geo-referenced images of the most interesting features observed at the surface of the comet are presented and consequences for their formation are discussed. If they are detected, topographic changes which could have occured between August and December 2014 are also presented.\nAcknowledgements.

            "abstract": "Shallow aseismic creep has been observed on many strike-slip faults around the world. The initiation process for shallow creep remains unclear, and no clear explanation exists for why creep persists for years/decades after some earthquakes while after others it decays completely within months. Many earthquakes exhibit a shallow coseismic slip deficit. We hypothesise that shallow creep can begin after such events to 'catch up' with the slip deficit relative to deeper sections of the fault. We test this hypothesis with persistent scatterer InSAR analysis of 3 descending and 2 ascending Envisat tracks that together span a region covering the 1999 Izmit and Duzce ruptures in Turkey. Our data covers an 8 year time window between 2003 – 2010. A section of the Izmit rupture was previously shown to be undergoing shallow creep. But the spatial and temporal nature of this creep remains unclear. We use a small baseline processing strategy using the StaMPS software, which allows for checking of unwrapping errors by summing the residuals around closed interferometric loops. We make an addition to the code to detect and fix unwrapping errors. This is done by automatically detecting and fixing pixels that are unwrapped correctly in an initial run. The procedure is iterated until unwrapping errors are corrected. By combining our InSAR results with existing GPS measurements we obtained a map of horizontal and vertical surface displacements over time. From this we calculated the variation in creep rates along the earthquake ruptures. We show that shallow creep at an average rate of 10 mm/yr is limited to the Izmit rupture and does not extend laterally to the Duzce segment. We use elastic dislocation models to determine the creep distribution with depth and compare with the coseismic slip observed in the Izmit earthquake. We find the creep rate is highest in a region of shallow coseismic slip deficit. The creep rate exponentially decays with time after the earthquake to a steady rate. We model this temporal behaviour using rate and state friction theory and determine variations in frictional properties within the creeping region.",

            "abstract": "Laccoliths are shallow plutonic structures that develop by uplifting and deforming overlying horizontal and near-horizontal strata. Radial drainage patterns resulting from this uplift coupled with proposed short timescales of emplacement through several episodes of rapid magmatic intrusion (<100 yr) provide a natural laboratory for the interaction between magmatically induced uplift and bedrock erosion. To investigate the coupling between the two, we compare results from numerical models of landscape evolution with analysis of natural laccolith-influenced landscapes on the Colorado Plateau. In particular, we focus on the Mount Hillers (Henry Mountains, UT), Shay Mountains (UT), and Navajo Mountains (AZ) laccoliths. Reconstructions of the original inflated surfaces of Hillers and Navajo Mtn. are available, from which we can estimate total volume and patterns of denudation since emplacement.\nWe generate synthetic laccoliths to quantify landscape response through time in a simplified modeling framework. Surface deformation is modeled using the classical elastic flexure solution for laccolith emplacement (Pollard & Johnson, 1972), also exploring more recent treatments that include role of gravity. We analyze different growth curves by exploring pressure distribution and influx rates during emplacement. Landscape response to this surface uplift is then modeled numerically using the landscape evolution code of Perron et al. (2008). We quantify the dominant spectra of erosion and vary laccolith inflation rate and background erosion rates to construct a regime diagram of model landscape response to laccolith emplacement. We then asses the ability of these models to explain real laccolith topographic data, with the ultimate aim of providing constraints on the timing of laccolith dissection on the Colorado Plateau and more generally quantify the influence of intrusive magmatism on landscape evolution.",

            "abstract": "The 200 km long, northwest-striking Tuz Gölü fault zone, located along the eastern margin of the Tuz Gölü basin, represents an integral part of the Central Anatolian Plateau (CAP). Late Miocene to recent uplift of the northern and southern margins of the CAP are relatively well understood, however the uplift history of the plateau interior remains poorly constrained. Situated within the interior of the CAP, the Tuz Gölü fault zone may offer first-order constraints on the timing and pattern of regional uplift.\nThe Tuz Gölü fault zone may have developed as early as Maastrichtian times. Whether it initially formed as an extensional or compressional structure remains contentious, as the fault system has likely undergone multiple episodes of reactivation. In this study, we use a combination of paleostress and morpho-tectonic analysis to further delineate the geologic history and evolution of the Tuz Gölü fault zone. Paleostress analysis of fault and joint data show two principal phases of deformation – pre-upper Miocene compression and late Miocene to Quaternary extension, supporting a regional changeover from compression to extension in Anatolia during the late Miocene that broadly coincides with the onset of regional uplift. Additionally, we conducted a morphometric analysis of over 300 drainage basins along the range-front, measuring mountain front sinuosity, basin asymmetry, basin elongation, basin-fault azimuth, and hypsometry. Overall, morphometric indices provide evidence of a southeastward increase in footwall uplift rate of the Tuz Gölü fault zone that could be the result of a regional uplift gradient, block rotations, or a combination of these processes. Basin asymmetry and basin-fault azimuth indicate north-northwest tilting of catchments which may be linked to regional tilting associated with late Miocene to recent uplift of the CAP. Lastly, our morphometric data support migration of deformation into the Tuz Gölü basin interior. Our regional observations could reflect uplift in the CAP interior, crustal thinning associated with slab-tear propagation in the subducting African lithosphere, or elevated extension and isostatic rebound in the Tuz Gölü footwall due to the presence of a detachment system that is active in the uppermost crust and above which basin fill is being uplifted and eroded.",

In order to gain further temporal and chemical understanding on the effects of tectonic processes on cratonic roots, we carried out a Re-Os isotopic study on peridotites (n = 11) from Lashaine, which will be followed by Lu-Hf, Sm-Nd and Sr isotope investigations of the constituent minerals of the same samples.\nThe preliminary whole-rock Os isotope data from Lashaine peridotites show a large range of 187Os/188Os (0.1061 - 0.1261), with TRD ages from Meso-Archean to very young (3.1 Ga to 0.3 Ga). There is a negative correlation between TRD and bulk alumina contents. One sample with the lowest Al2O3 yields the oldest age of 3.1 Ga. Five samples range from 2.5 to 2.8 Ga, three give ages close to 2 Ga, and one sample with a high Al2O3 has a TRD at 0.3 Ga. The positive Al2O3-187Os/188Os correlation trend passes above the PM composition may reflect ancient metasomatism by high Re/Os melts or recent metasomatism by very radiogenic Os plume-derived melts. These processes could be related to the evolution of the peripheral Proterozoic mobile belts, or Cenozoic rifting on the Eastern margin. Collectively, our new Os isotope data demonstrate that Meso-Archean (at least 3.1 Ga old) mantle portions are still retained underneath the rifted Eastern margin of the Craton. This is in line with previous results indicating that Archean cratonic mantle extended to the far eastern margin of the Craton, and also that the ages of the mantle root of the Tanzanian Craton are comparable to the other Cratons (e.g., Kaapvaal and Zimbabwe).",

            "abstract": "Hong Kong, one of the busiest trading harbors in the world, is also a city of 8 million of people. The biggest problem that the government faces is the lack of solid waste landfill space. Hong Kong produces around 13,500 tons of waste per day. There are three landfills in Hong Kong in operation. These three landfills will soon be exhausted in around 2020, and the solid waste in Hong Kong is still increasing. Out of the 13,500 tons of solid waste, 9,000 tons are organic solid waste or food waste. Food waste, especially domestic waste, is recyclable.\nThe Independent Schools Foundation Academy has a project to collect domestic food waste (from the school cafeteria) for decomposition. Our school produces around 15 tons of food waste per year. The project includes a sub-project in the Primary school, which uses the organic soil produced by an aerobic food waste machine, the Rocket A900, to plant vegetables in school. This not only helps our school to process the waste, but also helps the Primary students to study agriculture and have greater opportunities for experimental learning.\nFor this project, two types of machines will be used for food waste processing. Firstly, the Dehydra made by Tiny Planet reduces the volume and the mass of the food waste, by dehydrating the food waste and separating the ground food waste and the excessive water inside machine for further decomposition. Secondly, the A900 Rocket, also made by Tidy Planet; this is used to process the dehydrated ground food waste for around 14 days thereby producing usable organic soil. It grinds the food waste into tiny pieces so that it is easier to decompose. It also separates the wood chips inside the ground food waste. This machine runs an aerobic process, which includes O2 and will produce CO2 during the process and is less harmful to the environment. On the other hand, if it is an anaerobic process occurs during the operation, it will produce a greenhouse gas- CH4 -and smells bad.",

The purposes of the developed approach are: (1) to apply WASP-based fluid dynamic sediment concentration simulation model and the developed extracting method of ideal releasing practice to search the optimal initial solution for optimization; and (2) to construct the replacing sediment concentration simulation model which embedded in the optimization model. In this study, the optimization model is solved by tabu search, and the optimized releasing hydrograph is then used for construction of the decision model. This study applies Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Real-time Recurrent Learning Neural Network (RTRLNN) as construction tool of the concentration simulation model for total suspended solids. This developed approach is applied to the Shihmen Reservoir basin, Taiwan. The assessment index of operational outcome of multi-purpose multi-layer conjunctive releasing are maximum sediment concentration at Yuan-Shan weir, sediment removed ratio, highest water level at Shan-Yin Bridge, and final water level in Shihmen reservoir. The analyzed and optimizing results shows the following: (1) The multi-layer releasing during the stages before flood coming and before peak flow possess high potential for flood detention and sedimentation control; and during the stages after peak flow, for turbidity control and storage; (2) The ability of error toleration and adaption of ANFIS is superior, so ANFIS-based sediment concentration simulation model surpass RTRLNN-based model on simulating the mechanism and characteristics of sediment transport; and (3) The developed approach can effectively and automatically retrieve the optimal multi-layer releasing strategies under the trade-off control between flooding, sedimentation, turbidity and water supply.",

Increased intensity of the hydrologic cycle can impair water quality through both drought and runoff associated with extreme precipitation events. Local changes or extremes in hydrological cycles can also alter the life cycles of moquitoes, ticks, snails, and other carriers of human diseases. These impacts in turn can affect the transmission of malaria, schistosomiasis, and many other human diseases. Warmer freshwater and coastal waters, in combination with other factors like fertilizer runoff and salinity, are also associated with proliferation of a variety of human pathogens, including cyanobacteria and vibrio species.\nThis presentation will highlight the many linkages between climate change, water and human health.

By assuming that the South Pacific Subtropical Counter-Current and it's underlying undercurrent can be represented by a 2-1/2 layer system, a measure of baroclinic instability and it's growth rates can be calculated. This instability is related to the shearing and stratification of the system. The causes for the variability in this region are explored by using data from the European Centre for Mid-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Ocean Re-Analysis product. Low frequency changes in both the shearing and the stratification are found to have a measurable contribution to changes in the baroclinic instability. The fluctuations in the stratification are found to have the greatest impact on low-frequency changes to the baroclinic instability, and subsequently, the eddy variability. This stratification is altered primarily through a low-frequency warming of the upper layer in the region. The change in stratification leads to an increase in the baroclinic Rossby wave speed, and a reduction in the baroclinic instability. Fluctuations in the forcings on the system are analyzed in an effort to determine the low frequency variations in the shear and stratification.",

The observations of SNR provide a simple method to extract the frequencies to measure the variations of the sea level. We analyzed 24-hour 1 Hz GPS SNR data for a whole year from two local GPS tide gauge stations, KASH and LNDO, installed at the Kaohsiung and Longdong Port in the southwest and northeast Taiwan, respectively. Daily sea level variations are near to 1.5 m at these two KASH and LNDO sites. The sea level variations from the GPS SNR data are compared with the records from the traditional tide gauges and also with the 8-day sea level GPS positioning results from a buoy instrument setting in the Kaohsiung Port nearby the KASH site, respectively. Precision and accuracy of the sea level variations from GPS SNR data will be assessed. The limitations and prospects of using reflected GPS signals to estimate sea level variations will be also discussed in this study.",

In this study, snow cover area (SCA) dynamics of the Upper Heihe River Basin are examined based on the flexible multiday combined MODIS snow cover products during hydrological years 2001–2014 (September through August) and are correlated with precipitation (P) and temperature (T) at five ecoregions of different land cover types and elevations (mean elevations of 3968.91 m (P1), 3819.82 m (P2), 4113.29 m (P3), 3179.60 m (P4), and 2898.64 m (P5)) (Figure 1). Our hypothesis is that temperature is the main explanatory variable for low elevation zone and precipitation is a better predictor of snow cover area at high elevation zones. However, our preliminary results does not indicate strong evidence to support or against the hypothesis due to the low correlation coefficients. The potential reason for such a result could be due to the coarse resolution of precipitation (25 km ×25 km) as compared with SCA data (500 m ×500 m) and T data ( 1 km ×1 km). High resolution datasets based on point measurements might be needed to test the hypothesis.",

            "abstract": "Non-native ungulates have substantial impacts on native ecosystems globally, altering both plant communities and soil biogeochemistry. Across tropical and temperate ecosystems, land managers fence and remove non-native ungulates to conserve native biodiversity, a costly management action, yet long-term outcomes are not well quantified. Specifically, knowledge gaps include: (i) the magnitude and time frame of plant community recovery; (ii) the response of non-native invasive plants; and (iii) changes to soil biogeochemistry. In 2010, we established a series of paired ungulate presence vs. removal plots that span a 20 yr. chronosequence in tropical montane wet forests on the Island of Hawaii to quantify the impacts and temporal legacy of feral pig removal on plant communities and soil biogeochemistry. We also compared soil biogeochemistry in targeted areas of low and high feral pig impact. Our work shows that both native and non-native vegetation respond positively to release from top-down control following removal of feral pigs, but species of high conservation concern recover only if initially present at the time of non-native ungulate removal. Feral pig impacts on soil biogeochemistry appear to last for at least 20 years following ungulate removal. We observed that both soil physical and chemical properties changed with feral pig removal. Soil bulk density and volumetric water content decreased while extractable base cations and inorganic N increased in low vs. high feral pig impact areas. We hypothesize that altered soil biogeochemistry facilitates continued invasions by non-native plants, even decades after non-native ungulate removal. Future work will concentrate on comparisons between wet and dry forest ecosystems and test whether manipulation of soil nutrients can be used to favor native vs. non-native plant establishment.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake focal mechanisms of the Shanxi rift system, North China, are investigated for the time period 1965 - Apr. 2014. A total of 143 focal mechanisms of ML ≥ 3.0 earthquakes were compiled. Among them, 105 solutions are newly determined by combining the P-wave first motions and full waveform inversion, and 38 solutions are from available published data. Stress tensor inversion was then performed based on the new database. The results show that most solutions exhibit normal or strike-slip faulting, and the regional stress field is characterized by a stable, dominating NNW-SSE extension and an ENE-WSW compression. This correlates well with results from GPS data, geological field observations and leveling measurements across the faults. Heterogeneity exists in the regional stress field, as indicated by individual stress tensor inversions conducted for five subzones. While the minimum stress axis (σ3) appears to be consistent and stable, the orientations, especially the plunges, of the maximum and intermediate stresses (σ1 and σ2) vary significantly among the different subzones. Based on our results and combining multidisciplinary observations from geological surveys, GPS and cross-fault monitoring, a kinematic model is proposed, to illustrate the present-day stress field and its correlation with the regional tectonics, as well as the current crustal deformation of the Shanxi rift system. Results obtained in this study, may help to understand the geodynamics, neotectonic activity, active seismicity and potential seismic hazard in this region of North China.",

            "abstract": "Episodic tremor and slip (ETS) has been observed in Cascadia subduction zone at two different time scales: tremor at a high-frequency range of 2-8 Hz and slow slip events at a geodetic time-scale of days-months. The intermediate time scale is needed to understand the source spectrum of slow earthquakes. Ghosh et al. (2014, IRIS abs) recently reported the presence of very low frequency earthquakes (VLFEs) in Cascadia. In southwest Japan, VLFEs are usually observed at a period range around 20-50 s, and coincide with tremors (e.g., Ito et al. 2007). In this study, we analyzed VLFEs in and around the Olympic Peninsula to confirm their presence and estimate their moment release. We first detected VLFE events by using broadband seismograms with a band-pass filter of 20-50 s. The preliminary result shows that there are at least 16 VLFE events with moment magnitudes of 3.2-3.7 during the M6.8 2010 ETS. The focal mechanisms are consistent with the thrust earthquakes at the subducting plate interface. To detect signals of VLFEs below noise level, we further stacked long-period waveforms at the peak timings of tremor amplitudes for tremors within a 10-15 km radius by using tremor catalogs in 2006-2010, and estimated the focal mechanisms for each tremor source region as done in southwest Japan (Takeo et al. 2010 GRL). As a result, VLFEs could be detected for almost the entire tremor source region at a period range of 20-50 s with average moment magnitudes in each 5-min tremor window of 2.4-2.8. Although the region is limited, we could also detect VLFEs at a period range of 50-100 s with average moment magnitudes of 3.0-3.2. The moment release at 50-100 s is 4-8 times larger than that at 20-50 s, roughly consistent with an omega-squared spectral model. Further study including tremor, slow slip events and characteristic activities, such as rapid tremor reversal and tremor streaks, will reveal the source spectrum of slow earthquakes in a broader time scale from 0.1 s to days.",

Over 15 years ago, a diverse team of scientists began to develop the concept of a multi-phase, long term Colorado Plateau Coring Project (CPCP). Planning involved two major meetings (DOSECC/NSFICDP supported in Fall, 2007, St. George, UT; and International Continental Drilling Program (ICDP) supported in Spring, 2009, Albuquerque, NM). The National Park Service embraced the concept of Phase One drilling at Petrified Forest National Park (PFNP) in northern Arizona, which exposes one of the most famous and best studied successions of the continental Triassic on Earth, and the Phase One target was decided. Most drilling operation costs were secured from ICDP in Summer, 2010. In late 2013, following more recent NSF support, the research team, utilizing Ruen Drilling Inc., drilled a continuous ~530 m core (60o plunge) through the entire section of Triassic strata (Chinle and Moenkopi fms.) in the north end and a ~240 m core (75o plunge) in lower Chinle and all Moenkopi strata at the south end of the PFNP. Our continuous sampling will place this record in a reliable quantitative and exportable time scale, as a reference section in which magnetostratigraphic, geochronologic, environmental, and paleontologic data are registered to a common thickness scale with unambiguous superposition using pristine samples. The cores are being scanned at the High Resolution X-ray Computed Tomography Facility at UT Austin. They will be transported to the LacCore National Lacustrine Core Facility at U Minnesota, where they will be split, imaged, and scanned for several properties, including XRF data. The core will then be transported to the Rutgers University for sampling. The planning team is contemplating Phase Two options (e.g., the Middle to Lower Triassic marine-influenced section west of the Colorado Plateau (St. George, Utah) area or the Upper Triassic to Lower Jurassic sequence in the Comb Ridge area (Bluff, Utah)).",

            "abstract": "Since the discovery of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and El Nino Modoki (EM), many had thought that all of these 3 climate phenomena are influencing the precipitation in Mindanao and Northeastern Borneo. However, no study was done to identify the real impact of these three climate phenomena on the precipitation of this area. Based on the situation above, this study intends to investigate the influence of ENSO, IOD and EM to Mindanao and Northeastern Borneo precipitation. Besides that, we are investigating factor other than those dominant climate phenomena that affect the precipitation in the study region.\nFor this study, we used APHRODITE (observation precipitation data) as our primary precipitation data. For analysis, we used 850hPa wind data (JRA-55), 200hPa stream function data (JRA-55) and sea surface temperature data (SST; HadISST) from 1961 to 2007. Correlation, partial correlation and composite analyses are used as the method for this study.\nWe discovered that ENSO during December-February (DJF), March-May and September-November (SON) influence the precipitation in the study region. Further analysis indicated that EM during DJF and SON influences precipitation of those regions. The results show that the ENSO and the EM influence the precipitation of this region through Walker circulation and associated teleconnections. However, IOD influence is not significant in any season.\nIt is also discovered that the precipitation in the region is greatly affected by the local winds northeast of Mindanao during DJF. Those are the regional monsoon winds for the Asian Winter Monsoon. In addition, the winter monsoon rainfall is influenced by the winds that are in turn associated with the variations in Aleutian Low and Siberian High. Further analysis will be done to understand the links among them (SST, regional monsoon winds and 200hPa streamfunction) and consequently the mid-latitude teleconnections that affect the regional monsoon winds.",

            "abstract": "There has been few efforts at experimental validation of the Relativistic Runaway Electron Avalanche (RREA) model as an explanation of lightning initiation. Similarly, there have been few efforts to determine the energetic secondary electron environment from cosmic ray extensive air showers (CREAS) in order to verify if sufficient numbers electrons exist at thunderstorm altitudes to initiate lightning by this model. We are attempting to experimentally validate the RREA model by correlating time- and location-resolved lightning initiation data from the Oklahoma Lightning Mapping Array (OKLMA) with time- and location-resolved cosmic ray muon count rate data. Secondary cosmic ray muons are used as a proxy for relativistic seed electrons produced in CREAS. An array of four ground-based cosmic ray muon detectors have been designed, fabricated, and deployed in the shape of a 200 m square within the central area of coverage of the OKLMA. Each detector measures the muon count rate with sub-millisecond resolution and data from the four detectors are combined to identify large CREAS. Data from the cosmic ray muon detectors obtained while thunderstorms pass over the array are then compared to OKLMA data.\nUsing the CORSIKA Monte Carlo cosmic ray transport code, we have determined the energy spectrum and ambient flux of secondary electrons in both fair weather and thunderstorm atmospheric conditions <12 km above sea level. The secondary electron energy spectrum contains a population of >100 MeV electrons, which are able to generate many additional relativistic secondary electrons. The ambient flux of secondary electrons increases exponentially with altitude with a value of 260 electrons m-2 sr-1 s-1 at 8 km, but the electron flux can be >105 m-2 inside the core of a 1016 eV air shower.",

            "abstract": "In the presentation we get use of the global gravity dataset EGM2008 and a local terrestrial gravity data survey for a constrained 3-D crustal density modeling of a stratovolcano and its surrounding area located close to the border of North Korea and China. The independent geophysical (seismic, seismology, geochemistry) and petrological constraints will be presented together with the preprocessing of data base by curvature analysis and Euler deconvolution. The multiple data base is used to assist a general interpretation of the investigated area in time, and the 3D density model (modelled by the inhouse IGMAS+ software). Mt. Paekdu is characterized by a low of Bouguer anomaly of some –110 ´ 10–5 m/s2, which is caused by the combined gravity effects of (1) Moho depth of about 40 km, (2) a zone with both lower P-wave velocity and density than the surrounding, (3) low density volcanic rocks at the surface, and (4) the presence of a magma chamber that has not previously been identified.\nThe terrestrial gravity field measured along the seismic profile shows a remarkable anomaly descending from the southern- to the northern flank of the Mt. Paekdu volcano, which should be a typical anomaly pattern generally obsered over the active volcanic area in the world (e.g. the Yellow Stone volcano). The trend is interpreted to be caused by a prominent density difference between a serious of high density mid crustal sill beneath the southern flank and a predicted partial melted zone locating in the northern flank. With the help of several geoscientific observations (seismic, electromagnetic, gravity and geochemistry) and the 3D density model we conclude that a high density sill was formed in Pliocene and early Pleistocene after pre-shield plateau-forming eruption. Since the Pliocene, volcanic activity in the Mt. Paekdu region might be migrated from the southeastern of North Korea to the northwest, following the path of NW–SE-trending faults. Recently observed seismic tremors can be explained by the vertical movement of the partial melted magma chamber beneath the northern part of the Mt. Baekdu volcanic area, which is confirmed by vertical stress calculation.",

Cd isotopes have great prospects in the study of the cosmogony, the trace of anthropogenic sources, the micronutrient cycling and the ocean productivity. This study develops an optimized technique for the precise and accurate determination of Cd isotopic compositions. Cd was separated from the matrix by elution with AG-MP-1 anionic exchange chromatographic resin. The matrix elements (K, Na, Ca, Al, Fe, and Mg etc.), polyatomic interfered elements (Ge, Ga, Zr, Nb, Ru, and Mo), and isobaric interfered elements (In, Pd and most of Sn) were eluted using HCl with gradient descent concentrations (2, 0.3, 0.06, 0.012 and 0.0012 mol L-1). The same elution procedure was repeated to eliminate the residuel Sn (Sn/Cd < 0.018). The collected Cd was analyzed using MC-ICP-MS, in which the instrumental mass fractionation was controlled by a “sample-standard bracketing” technique. The recovery of Cd larger than 96.85%, and the δ114/110Cd are in the range of -1.43~+0.20‰ for ten geological reference materials (GSD-3a, GSD-5a, GSD-7a, GSD-6, GSD-9, GSD-10, GSD-11, GSD-12, GSD-23, and GSS-1). The δ114/110Cd obtained for GSS-1 soil sample relative to the NIST SRM 3108 Cd solution was 0.20, which was coherent with the literature values (0.08±0.23). This method had a precision of 0.001~0.002% (RSD), an error range of 0.06~0.14 (δ114/110Cd, 2σ), and a long-term reproducibility of 0.12 (δ114/110Cd, 2σ).",

            "abstract": "Understanding how rock microstructures and, in turn, the spatial distribution of the properties of the rock skeleton (porosity, permeability, and elastic properties) evolve because of time-variant, thermo-chemo-mechanical processes is fundamental to decipher changes in the earth’s crust due to rock-fluid interactions using remote geophysical monitoring methods. Laboratory experiments undoubtedly play a vital role in understanding the underlying basic rules that are needed to inform both simulations and modeling. Nevertheless, capturing coupled chemo-mechanical processes experimentally is a very challenging problem because as pore space deforms chemo-mechanically, the fluid reacts and flows through a deforming pore space. The result is that as much as we strive to achieve controlled conditions in laboratory experiments, it is extremely difficult to control for all of the possible responses of the highly heterogeneous pore network. To overcome such a limitation, we often resort to the fabrication of rock samples in the laboratory. Nevertheless, analogs are not rocks. This level of complexity requires an approach that advances beyond the limitations of each method, be it experimental or computational. I present an approach that takes advantage of the favorable aspects of experimental diagenesis, multi-scale imaging techniques (from pore scale to 3D rock volumes) and 3D printed models of varying carbonate microstructures. This approach allows us to study the evolution of natural pore network geometries from diagenesis experiments, use the basic rules of the evolving microstructures to drive the digital change of the pore network of the printed models in a well-controlled fashion as much possible in the analog experiments, and then iteratively measure the properties of the printed models at the scale of the laboratory. This integration can help make sense of the trackless evolution of properties in apparently scattered datasets such as those characterizing carbonate rocks.",

The oldest sedimentary rocks in the 50 m above igneous basement may correspond to the time of subduction initiation to the east. They are lithologically complex, consisting of a mix of variably tuffaceous mudstone, sandstone and breccia-conglomerate with some basaltic andesite passing upsection into 50 m of reddish-brown, radiolarian-bearing hemipelagic mudstone with thin volcaniclastic siltstone to sandstone beds. Coarser volcaniclastic rocks (andesitic average whole rock composition) then dominate the overlying section from 1360 to 160 mbsf. Variably graded tuffaceous sandstone to conglomerate and breccia beds range from a few cm to 9 m in thickness and exhibit a wide range of bedding contact relationships and sedimentary structures, including partial to complete Bouma sequences. Gravel to silt-sized volcaniclastic sediment was likely delivered to the site by gravity flows ranging from low- to high-concentration turbidity currents to debris flows. The depositional setting was ~ 50 km from the main arc front (Palau-Kyushu Ridge, PKR), so these may represent very distal apron to fan deposits. The sharp decline in coarse volcanic sediment supply and switch to hemipelagic mud accumulation at ~160mbsf is coincident with the C. 25 Ma transformation of the KPR to a remnant arc by backarc spreading in the adjacent Shikoku Basin and the eastward migration of magmatic arc activity to the IBM.",

            "abstract": "The interseismic and postseismic deformations preceding and following the large subduction earthquake of Maule (Chile, Mw8.8, 2010) have been closely monitored with GPS from 70 km up to 2000 km away from the trench. Post-seismic deformations exhibit a behavior generally similar to that already observed after the Tohoku-Oki earthquake. Like in Japan, vertical uplift is observed on the oceanward side of the volcanic arc. A moderate large scale subsidence is associated with sizeable horizontal deformation in the far-field (500-2000km from the trench). In addition, near-field data (70-200km from the trench) feature a rather complex deformation pattern. Further north, we observe an increase of the eastward velocities and a slight rotation toward the North. We use a 3D FE code (Zebulon Zset) to relate these deformations to the mechanical properties of the mantle. The mesh features a spherical shell-portion from the core-mantle boundary to the earth's surface, extending over more than 60 degrees in latitude and longitude. The overridding and subducting plates are elastic, and the asthenosphere is viscoelastic. We test the presence and shape of two low viscosity areas in the mantle : a low viscosity wedge (LVW) above the subducting plate extending beneath the volcanic arc, and a narrow low viscosity channel (LVCh) along the lower part of the subduction interface, and potentially deeper. All the viscoelastic regions feature a Burgers rheology and we invert for their mechanical properties and geometrical characteristics. Our best fitting models present, (i) an asthenosphere extending down to 270km, with a 'long-term' viscosity of the order of 3.1018 Pa.s; (ii) a LVCh along the plate interface extending from depths of 50 to 150 km with viscosities slightly below 1018 Pa.s; (iii) a LVW restricted to the base of the lithosphere below the volcanic arc, with viscosities of a few 1018 Pa.s. Increased horizontal velocities are due to relaxation in both the asthenosphere and the LVCh. A deep channel is necessary to produce enough uplift in the middle-field (200-500km from the trench). Some additional slip on the plate interface, at shallow depth, is also necessary to explain all the characteristics of the near-field displacements.",

            "abstract": "The high complexity and poor knowledge of the constitutive properties of porous rocks are principal obstacles for the modeling of their deformation. Normally, the constitutive lows are to be derived from the experimental data (nominal strains and stresses). They are known, however, to be sensitive to the mechanical instabilities within the rock specimen and the boundary (notably friction) conditions at its ends. To elucidate the impact of these conditions on the measured mechanical response we use 3-D finite-difference simulations of experimental tests. Modeling of hydrostatic tests was chosen because it does not typically involve deformation instabilities. The ends of the cylindrical ‘rock sample’ are in contact with the ‘steel’ elastic platens through the frictional interfaces. The whole system is subjected to a normal stress Pc applied to the external model surface. A new constitutive model of porous rocks with the cap-type yield function is used. This function is quadratic in the mean stress σm and depends on the inelastic strain γp in a way to generate strain softening at small σm and strain-hardening at high σm. The corresponding material parameters are defined from the experimental data and have clear interpretation in terms of the geometry of the yield surface. The constitutive model with this yield function and the Drucker-Prager plastic potential has been implemented in 3-D dynamic explicit code Flac3D. The results of an extensive set of numerical simulations at different model parameters will be presented. They show, in particular, that the shape of the ‘numerical’ hydrostats is very similar to that obtained from the experimental tests and that it is practically insensitive to the interface friction. On the other hand, the stress and strain fields within the specimen dramatically depend on this parameter. The inelastic deformation at the specimen’s ends starts well before reaching the grain crushing pressure P* and evolves heterogeneously with Pc. Initially it is concentrated near the sample’s ends and then propagates towards its centre such that the rate of γp (rate of material damage) at the specimen’s ends is first maximal and then minimal, which is also suggested by the acoustic emissions (Figure). The obtained results suggest ways of improvements of the rock testing.",

            "abstract": "We are working towards the development of a new statistical-dynamical downscaling system to study the influence of climate on tropical cyclones (TCs). The first step is development of an appropriate model for TC intensity as a function of environmental variables. We approach this issue with a stochastic model consisting of a multiple linear regression model (MLR) for 12-hour intensity forecasts as a deterministic component, and a random error generator as a stochastic component. Similar to the operational Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme (SHIPS), MLR relates the surrounding environment to storm intensity, but with only essential predictors calculated from monthly-mean NCEP reanalysis fields (potential intensity, shear, etc.) and from persistence. The deterministic MLR is developed with data from 1981-1999 and tested with data from 2000-2012 for the Atlantic, Eastern North Pacific, Western North Pacific, Indian Ocean, and Southern Hemisphere basins.\nWhile the global MLR's skill is comparable to that of the operational statistical models (e.g., SHIPS), the distribution of the predicted maximum intensity from deterministic results has a systematic low bias compared to observations; the deterministic MLR creates almost no storms with intensities greater than 100 kt. The deterministic MLR can be significantly improved by adding the stochastic component, based on the distribution of random forecasting errors from the deterministic model compared to the training data. This stochastic component may be thought of as representing the component of TC intensification that is not linearly related to the environmental variables. We find that in order for the stochastic model to accurately capture the observed distribution of maximum storm intensities, the stochastic component must be auto-correlated across 12-hour time steps. This presentation also includes a detailed discussion of the distributions of other TC-intensity related quantities, as well as the inter-annual variability of predicted storm intensity in the form of accumulated cyclone energy (ACE). Applying this stochastic model in conjunction with global climate model fields is an ongoing task.",

            "abstract": "The early Pliocene, with atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations at levels similar to today, is seen as a case study for Earth’s future climate evolution. During this period the progressive closing of the Central American Seaway led to increased poleward heat and salt transport within the Atlantic with North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) becoming warmer and saltier and resulting in an enhanced Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). In order to understand how stable the AMOC really was we produced millennial-scale (1-2 kyr) surface and deep-water records for IODP Site U1313 (41°N, 33°W, 3412m) for the interval from 3.4 to 4.1 Ma. This site is ideally located to monitor past AMOC changes with North Atlantic Drift waters at the surface and NADW in the deep. Although interglacial/glacial cycles are visible, the higher frequency oscillations recorded in both the planktonic G. ruber (white) and benthic Cibicidoides sp. δ18O records impede tuning to the LR04 stack (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005). We therefore exploit a different approach: using the magnetic polarity chrons (Gilbert, Cochiti) as recorded at Site U1313 as framework, we tune our benthic δ18O record to that of ODP Site 1085 (on LR04 ages). The benthic δ13C record shows millennial-scale oscillations, and the values indicate nearly continuous NADW presence and confirm a strong AMOC, also during most of the glacial periods. Varying surface water conditions, especially during the younger interglacial periods, are reflected in the G. ruber isotope data and appear to be linked to salinity changes since they are not recorded in the alkenone sea-surface temperature data. Although glacial stages Gi 2 and Gi 4 show the expected higher benthic δ18O values, Gi 6 was the glacial period with the strongest impact on the AMOC as revealed by cooler, less ventilated surface waters and a less ventilated NADW. Overall, the AMOC was strong throughout, but experienced high frequency oscillations at a level similar to the middle Pleistocene interglacial periods.\nLisiecki, L.E., Raymo, M., 2005.

Yet, despite today’s abundance of remote sensing data, an automated characterization of large-scale historical changes in urban spatial extent remains a challenge due to the inherent complexity and variability of the urban environment, the lack of a spectral signature unique to urban land cover, and the absence of an unambiguous definition of what is urban versus non-urban.\nHere we present a consistent, robust, scalable, physically- based methodology for characterization of urban expansion using Landsat observations. We use atmospherically corrected Landsat Global Land Survey time series, Web-enabled Landsat data time series, DMSP-OLS and NPP-VIIRS nighttime lights, for mapping the built-up and vegetated components of urban settlements at 30m resolution through multi- temporal standardized spectral mixture analysis. The methodology is tested and validated over the North American continent where it provides a first quantification of urban expansion and vegetation abundance changes from 1990 to 2010.",

            "abstract": "The soil moisture - precipitation (SMP) feedback is of key importance for climate and climate change. A positive SMP feedback tends to amplify the hydrological response to external forcings (and thereby fosters precipitation and drought extremes), while a negative SMP feedback tends to moderate the influence of external forcings (and thereby stabilizes the hydrological cycle). The sign of the SMP feedback is poorly constrained by the current literature. Theoretical, modeling and observational studies partly disagree, and have suggested both negative and positive feedback loops. Can wet soil anomalies indeed result in either an increase or a decrease of precipitation (positive or negative SMP feedback, respectively)?\nHere we investigate the local SMP feedback using real-case and idealized convection-resolving simulations. An idealized simulation strategy is developed, which is able to replicate both signs of the feedback loop, depending on the environmental parameters. The mechanism relies on horizontal soil moisture variations, which may develop and intensify spontaneously. The positive expression of the feedback is associated with the initiation of convection over dry soil patches, but the convective cells then propagate over wet patches, where they strengthen and preferentially precipitate. The negative feedback may occur when the wind profile is too weak to support the propagation of convective features from dry to wet areas. Precipitation is then generally weaker and falls preferentially over dry patches. The results highlight the role of the mid-tropospheric flow in determining the sign of the feedback. A key element of the positive feedback is the exploitation of both low convective inhibition (CIN) over dry patches (for the initiation of convection), and high CAPE over wet patches (for the generation of precipitation).\nThe results of this study will also be discussed in relation to climate change scenarios that exhibit large biases in surface temperature and interannual variability over mid-latitude summer climates, both over Europe and North America. It is argued that parameterized convection may contribute towards such biases by overemphasizing a positive SMP feedback.",

            "abstract": "Since the first discovery of black smokers on the Gaplapgaos spreading center, over 500 hydrothermal sites have been confirmed on the mid-ocean ridge, arc and back-arc settings (Beaulieu et al., 2013). However, the hydrothermal activity at triple-junction has not received much attention. Consequently, there are outstanding questions regarding the features of the hydrothermal system, and the effect of the hydrothermal circulation on the tectonic activity of the triple-junction.\nIn 2009, the Chinese Dayang Cruise 21 discovered the Precious Stone field (PSF) on the Dietz Semount at the southern flank of the Galapagos triple junction (GTJ). Most studies of the GTJ focus on the topographictectonic and stresssimulation, which suggest that the GTJ had complex evoluation(Smith et al., 2011, 2013; Mitchell et al., 2011,Schouten et al., 2012). Water anomay were clear detected and samples of hydrothermal deposit and rocks were collected by TV-Grab (Figure.1). This study aims to understand the geological features of the PSF related hydrothermal activity.\nHydrothermal mineralization\nThree types of sedimentary hydrothermal deposits representing three different hydrothermal activity stages (Figure 1)are confirmed in the PSF: 1) sediments with native sulfur and pyrite clasts(Type I), 2) Fe—Mn oxides (Type II), and 3) clay minerals mainlynontronite(Type III). Type II sedimentsprecipitate early and the source comprises of clasts of distal hydrothermal plume. The nontronite-rich sediments propably derive from the low-temperature alteration of Fe—Mn oxides. Type 1 sediments are found on the active hydrothermal venting field.\nHydrothermal plume\nWater anomaly were detected at the southewestern PSF. We observed widespreadsedimentary hydrothermal depositsin the western PSF, but no water anomaly. According to the results of five water anomaly dectection lines, we predicted the existence of three hydrothermal vents in the PSF.\nSeafloor type inversion\nMulti-beam backscatter data were used to study the seafloor type and distribution of the PSF. The results indicate that sedimentary hydrothermal deposits are widespread at the western PSF. Basalt makes up of the seafloor of the active hydrothermal vents.\nThe results mentioned above suggest that the hydrothemal activity at the PSF is multi-stage, long-lived and wildspread.",

The water is input through two underground tunnels from the Wu-Jie dam in the upstream of the Zhuo-shui river. Although the Wu-Jie dam has been trying to keep the tunnels transporting clean water into the lake, the water is still mixed with muds. The silty water brings the deposits accumulating outwards from positions of the tunnel outlets resulting in a deposit fan formed in the lake. To monitor how the fan is accumulated is then very important in terms of environmental issue, tourism and electric power resources. Institute of Oceanography, National Taiwan University therefore conducted projects to use the multi-beam echo sounders to collect bathymetric data, and used the Chirp sub-bottom profiler to explore silted pattern inside the deposit fan. With these data, underwater topographic maps were plotted to observe the shape and internal structure of the fan. Moreover, two sets of data obtained in 2006 and 2012 were used to estimate the siltation magnitude and pattern in the six years period.The multi-beam sounder is Resons Seabat 9001s model; it collects 60 values in each of the swaths positioned by the DGPS method.The sub-bottom profiler is the EdgeTech 3100P Chirp Sonar, its acoustic wave frequency is in 2 ~ 16kHz. The data give the siltation amount in the Sun Moon Lake was around 3× 106 m³, which gives annual siltation rate at 5× 105 m³. The leading edge of the deposit fan has been expanded westwards 2 km from the water outlet since the tunnel was built 70 years ago; however, outside the deposit fan, the siltation shows insignificant amount on the water bottom.In the past few years the siltation mainly occurs outside in the east side of lake, more closer to the water outlets, the terrain had been increased from 744 m to 746 m (748.5 meters is stranded level of the lake).Observing sub-bottom profiler data, we can clearly see the location of the paleo-hard- bottom of the lake before the siltation occurred. These sub-bottom profiles can be used to check or to analyze episodic deposition behavior in producing the deposit fan.",

            "abstract": "Elevated ultraviolet (UV) radiation has been shown to stimulate litter decomposition. Despite years of research, it is still not fully understood that whether the fast litter degradation is mostly attributed to abiotic photo-mineralization or the combined abiotic and biotic degradation. Here we used meta-analysis to synthesize photodegradation studies and compared the effects of UV radiation on litter mass decomposition and chemistry with and without inhibiting microbial activities. We also conducted a microcosm experiment to separate UV’s impacts on abiotic and biotic process during decomposition. Overall, our meta-analysis found that, under abiotic condition, UV radiation reduced litter carbon (C) content by 1% and increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration by 16%, but had no significant impacts on litter mass remaining. Under the combined abiotic and biotic biodegradation, UV radiation reduced litter lignin content by 14% and mass remaining by 3%. In addition, high UV radiation reduced N immobilization by 19%. Results of our microcosm experiment further found that the amount of respired C induced by UV treated litter increased with UV exposure length, which suggested that longer UV exposure duration leads to greater biodegradability. The microcosm study also found that elevated UV did not alter microbial biomass carbon (MBC) or microbe’s ability to degrade organic matter. Overall, our meta-analysis and microcosm study suggested that although UV radiation significantly increase C loss by photo-mineralization, abiotic photo-mineralization was not great enough to induce significantly change in litter mass balance. However, with the presence of microbial activities, UV greatly facilitated litter decomposition. Such facilitating effect could be due to that elevated UV radiation increases lignin’s accessibility to microbes, and also increases labile carbon supply to microbes. Our results also highlighted that UV radiation could have significant impacts on N cycle during decomposition, mostly by inhibiting N immobilization, but not by accelerating N mineralization.",

            "abstract": "Late Quaternary deep sea sediments in the Arctic Ocean are characterized by brown layers intercalated with yellowish to olive gray layers. It has been known that the brown and gray layers were deposited during interglacial (or interstadial) and glacial (or stadial) periods, respectively. A 5.5-m long gravity core MA01 was obtained from the Mendeleev Ridge in the western Arctic Ocean by R/V Xue Long during scientific cruise CHINARE-V. Age (~1.0 Ma) of core MA01 was tentatively decided by correlation of sediment color cycles, XRF Mn and Ca cycles, and geomagnetic inclinations with core HLY0503-8JPC (Adler et al., 2009) and core HLY0503-06JPC(Cronin et al., 2013) that were also collected from the Mendeleev Ridge area. A total of 23 brown layers are characterized by low L* and b*, high Mn concentration, and abundant foraminifera. In contrast, gray layers are characterized by high L* and b*, low Mn concentration, and few foraminiferal tests. Foraminifera abundance peaks are not well correlated to CaCO3 peaks which are accompanied with the coarse-grained (>63 μm) fractions (i.e., IRD) both in brown and gray layers. A strong positive correlation coefficient (r2=0.89) between TOC content and C/N ratio indicates that the major source of organic matter is terrestrial. The good correlations of CaCO3 content to TOC (r2=0.56) and C/N ratio (r2=0.69) imply that IRDs contain detrital CaCO3 fraction which mainly originated from the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. In addition, high kaolinite/chlorite (K/C) ratios mostly correspond to CaCO3 peaks, also suggesting that the fine-grained particles in the Mendeleev Ridge were transported from the northern coasts of the Alaska and Canada. Thus, the Beaufort Gyre, the predominant surface current in the western Arctic Ocean, has played an important role in the sediment delivery to the Mendeleev Ridge. It is worthy of note that TOC and CaCO3 peaks are obviously distinct in the upper part of core MA01, whereas these peaks are reduced in the lower part of the core. More study on these contrasting features is in progress.",

            "abstract": "This study focuses on the last 1500 yr precipitation record archived in the mixed carbonate/siliciclastic sediments accumulated in the Belize Central Shelf Lagoon, part of the Yucatan Peninsula eastern continental margin, proximal to the land areas where the Mayan Civilization thrived and then abruptly collapsed. This study is mainly based upon the detailed analyses of cores, BZE-RH-SVC-58 and 68, retrieved in 30 and 19 m of water depth from Elbow Caye Lagoon and English Caye Channel, respectively. The core timeframe is well-constrained by AMS radiocarbon dating of benthic foraminifera, Quinqueloculina. Carbonate content was determined by carbonate bomb, particle size fractions with a Malvern Master Sizer 2000 particle size analyzer, and element (Ti, Si, K, Fe, Al, Ca, and Sr) counts via X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF). The variations of elements such as Ti and K counts, and Ti/Al in these two cores have recorded, in the past past 1500 years, the weathering rate variations of the adjacent Maya Mountain, defining alternating periods of high precipitation and droughts, linked to large climate fluctuations and extreme events, highly influenced by the ITCZ latitudinal migration.\nThe CE 800-900 century just preceding the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), characterized by unusually low Ti counts and Ti/Al, is interpreted to represent a time of low precipitation and resulting severe droughts in the Yucatan Peninsula, contemporaneous with the Mayan Terminal Classic Collapse. High Ti counts and Ti/Al, although highly variable, during the MCA (CE 900-1350) are interpreted as an unusually warm period characterized by two 100-to-250 years-long intervals of higher precipitation when the number of tropical cyclones peaked. These two intervals of high precipitation during the MCA are separated by a century (CE 1000 -1100) of severe droughts and low tropical storm frequency coinciding with the collapse of Chichen Itza (CE 1040-1100). The Little Ice Age (CE 1350-1850), several centuries during which Ti counts and Ti/Al reach minimum values, is characterized by systematic drier and colder climate conditions with low frequency of tropical cyclones. Two extreme Ti and K count minima might coincide with historical drought times and related Caribbean-wide famines in the year CE 1535 and the last third of the 18th century (CE 1765-1800).",

Our objective was to study the drought impact on the dynamics of Carbon, and water cycles, as well as the interaction between them under extreme climatic conditions in the plant soil continuum.\nThe first phase of the experiment involved 13CO2 pulse labeling of drought exposed and well-water beech microcosms, during which we monitored the 13C allocation to roots, and in the soil by measuring the CO2 concentration, ∂13C, and ∂18O of root derived CO2. We found that drought had a significant impact on, a) carbon assimilation, allocation, and translocation rate in the plant – soil system. The drought stressed plants not only assimilated fewer amounts of CO2, but also translocation of those assimilates belowground was extremely slow, and root respiration was low in comparison the well watered control plants.\nThe second phase involved rewetting of the drought chambers (and the application of similar amounts of water to the controls) using D218O enriched water followed by an additional 13CO2 pulse labeling approach so as to study the effects of drought on the infiltration patterns of a precipitation event as well as the recovery of the carbon relations of previously drought stressed beech saplings.",

Public’s exposure to particulate emissions is known to be highest on highway during daily commute. Total particle concentrations vary temporarily and spatially due to many reasons including particle nucleation, traffic, and meteorological conditions. The stationary ambient monitoring sites are too sparsely located to measure these variations on highway. Also, emissions from highways can be included in the emission inventory which can improve modeler capability to predict at much finer scale. Emissions from highways are vary temporally and spatially. This study used a mobile platform to measure total particle number, total particle surface area and average particle diameter in Lagrangian approach. The study will report occurrence and frequency of hot spots for particle nucleation on highway and temporal/ spatial variations of particle concentrations on highway. This will enable better assessment of public’s exposure to particulate emissions on highway by transportation and propose a methodology how to obtain emission inventory for major highways.",

            "abstract": "We obtained a new 3-D crustal and upper mantle shear wave velocity model of NE China from joint inversion of ambient noise data and teleseismic earthquake Rayleigh wave data using two-plane surface-wave tomography. Two-year continuous seismic records of 289 stations from the (portable) NECESSArray and the (permanent) CEA array were analyzed and phase velocity maps were obtained from period bands from 6s to 140s. S-wave velocity models were inverted by using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The resulting 3-D velocity model clearly shows a low velocity anomaly in the uppermantle of the Changbai mountain region associated with Cenozoic magmatism. Combined with the published body-wave tomography results we interpret this low velocity zone as the large-scale asthenospheric mantle upwelling and decompression melting related to the subduction of the Pacific Plate, which caused rifting and volcanic activities since 30 Ma ago. Fast velocity anomalies are observed in the upper mantle down to nearly 200 km depth beneath the Songliao basin. The high velocity anomaly may reflect a cooled mantle lithosphere since the formation of the basin. The two stages of lithospheric stretching of the basin from 157 to 102 Ma are followed by cooling, thickening of the lithosphere, and thermal subsidence. Slow velocity anomalies are also observed beneath the Dalainoer and Halaha volcanos in the Xing’an-Mongolia. These slow velocity anomalies could be caused by small-scale mantle convection due to undulations of lithospheric thickness in the region.",

GRACE data reveal that along the central-west coast of the GrIS, overall ice loss has been accelerating since 2007. However, we do not know the physical processes controlling the loss here, and the changes observed are not uniform in this region; several glaciers have gone through periods of slow-down in the recent past.\nTo address these uncertainties, we have performed ~30-year DEM differences of outlet glaciers in the region. Present-day DEMs have been created from WorldView-1 and -2 (WV) stereo imagery acquired in 2012 and 2013 using the AMES Stereo Pipeline. A 1985 DEM was created from a Greenland aerial photo survey. The DEM differences between the present-day WV DEMs and the 1985 aerial photo DEM show clearly that spatial variability in the surface elevation and terminus position changes of the glaciers in the region has been ongoing for the last ~30 years. We examine this variability in the context of ocean temperature and surface mass balance estimates to yield further insight into the external controls on these glaciers.",

            "abstract": "Normal incidence and wide-angle seismic reflection data acquired in the Central and southern parts of the Iberia Peninsula resolve the internal architecture and constrain the distribution of the physical properties along an almost 350 km long transect that samples the major tectonic domains of the Iberian Massif, including the Central Iberian Zone (CIZ) and the associated sutures. The internal architecture down to almost 70 km depth (~15 s TWTT) is resolved by the normal incidence data set. It images a number of elements that characterize the tectonics of the study area, which is one of the best exposed fragment of the Variscan orogenic Belt. A well marked brittle-to-ductile (B2D) transition separates the crust in two, the upper and mid-lower parts, approximately, 13 km and 18 km thick, respectively. The upper crust appears to be decoupled from the mid-lower crust and responded differently to shortening. The Mohorovicic discontinuity is located at ~10.5 s (TWTT) , it is relatively thick, and highly reflective beneath the CIZ. The wide-angle seismic transect extended the lithospheric section towards the north across the Madrid Basin. This profile provides very strong constraints on the distribution of physical properties (P- and S- wave velocities, Poisson's ratio) of the upper lithosphere as well as a high resolution image of the base of the crust beneath the area. This data is one of the first datasets to present solid evidence of a relatively significant crustal thickening beneath the Madrid Basin. The crustal thickness varies from ~31 km beneath the CIZ to ~35.5 km beneath the Madrid Basin. This data set also reveals two major discontinuity levels, the B2D and the Moho, both represent levels of lithological/rheological variations. The characteristics of the the PmP and SmS seismic phases suggest further details on the internal structure of the Moho. Furthermore, low fold wide-angle P and S wave stacks reveal a marked crust-mantle transition which is most probably a 5-6 km in thick and relatively complex structure.",

            "abstract": "Scajaquada Creek, which runs through the heart of the city of Buffalo, is a prime example of the ways in which human intervention and local geomorphology can impact water quality and urban hydrology. Beginning in the 1920’s, the Creek has been partially channelized and connected to Buffalo’s combined sewer system (CSS). At Forest Lawn Cemetery, where this study takes place, Scajaquada Creek emerges from a 3.5-mile tunnel built to route stream flow under the city. Collocated with the tunnel outlet is a discharge point for Buffalo’s CSS, combined sewer outlet (CSO) #53. It is at this point that runoff and sanitary sewage discharge regularly during rain events. Initially, this study endeavored to create a spatial and temporal picture for this portion of the Creek, monitoring such parameters as conductivity, dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, and turbidity, in addition to measuring Escherichia coli (E. coli) concentrations. As expected, these factors responded directly to seasonality, local geomorphology, and distance from the point source (CSO #53), displaying a overall, linear response. However, the addition of nitrate and phosphate testing to the study revealed an entirely separate signal from that previously observed. Concentrations of these parameters did not respond to location in the same manner as E. coli. Instead of decreasing with distance from the CSO, a distinct periodicity was observed, correlating with a series of outflow pipes lining the stream banks. It is hypothesized that nitrate and phosphate occurring in this stretch of Scajaquada Creek originate not from the CSO, but from fertilizers used to maintain the lawns within the subwatershed. These results provide evidence of the complexity related to water quality issues in urban streams as a result of point- and nonpoint-source hydrologic inputs.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying wetland greenhouse gas exchange is necessary to evaluate their potential for mitigating climate change via carbon sequestration. However measuring greenhouse gas fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) in wetlands is difficult due to high spatial and temporal variability, and multiple transport pathways of emission. Transport of biogenic soil gas via highly sporadic ebullition (bubbling) events is often ignored or quantified poorly in wetland greenhouse gas budgets, but can rapidly release large volumes of gas to the atmosphere. To quantify a robust annual ebullition flux we measured rates continuously for a year (2013-2014) using custom-built chambers deployed in a restored emergent wetland located in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, CA. We combined ebullition flux rates with observations of gas concentrations to estimate annual ebullition emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O and compare flux rates to whole-ecosystem exchange of CO2 and CH4 measured simultaneously by eddy covariance.\nMean ebullition flux rates were 18.3 ± 5.6 L m-2 yr-1. Ebullition CH4 concentrations were very high and ranged from 23-76 % with a mean of 47 ± 2.9 %; CO2 concentrations were lower and ranged from 0.7-6.6 % with a mean of 2.8 ± 0.3 %; N2O concentrations were below atmospheric concentrations and ranged from 130-389 ppb(v) with a mean of 257 ± 13 ppb(v). We calculated well-constrained annual ebullition fluxes of: 6.2 ± 1.9 g CH4 m-2 yr-1, 1.0 ± 0.3 g CO2 m-2 yr-1 and 9.3 ± 2.8 mg N2O m-2 yr-1. Methane emissions via ebullition were very large, representing 15-25 % of total wetland CH4 emissions measured at this site, whereas ebullition released only relatively small quantities of CO2 and N2O. Our results demonstrate that large releases of CH4 via ebullition from open water surfaces can be a significant component of restored wetland greenhouse gas budgets.",

            "abstract": "Generating the capacity to facilitate the informed usage of climate change science by decision makers on a large scale is fast becoming an area of great concern. While research demonstrates that sustained interactions between producers of such information and potential users can overcome barriers to information usage, it also demonstrates the high resource demand of these efforts. Our social science work at Great Lakes Integrated Sciences and Assessments (GLISA) sheds light on scaling up the usability of climate science through two research areas. The first focuses on partnerships with other boundary organizations that GLISA has leveraged – the “boundary chains” approach. These partnerships reduce the transaction costs involved with outreach and have enhanced the scope of GLISA’s climate service efforts to encompass new users such as First Nations groups in Wisconsin and Michigan and underserved neighborhoods in St. Paul, Minnesota. The second research area looks at the development of information usability across the regional scale of the eight Great Lakes states. It has identified the critical role that communities of practice are playing in making information usable to large groups of users who work in similar contexts and have similar information needs. Both these research areas demonstrate the emerging potential of flexible knowledge networks to enhance society’s ability to prepare for the impacts of climate change.",

            "abstract": "We have taught a required, senior, capstone course, with a focus on geoscience communication, for almost 35 years. While both of us were at the University of New Mexico, we alternated responsibility for teaching this course. The first author continues to teach a similar course at the University of Texas at Dallas. As the course has evolved and new approaches taken, we have incorporated more and more subject matter related to ethics in science and in particular the geological sciences. Our experiences indicate that (1) students are typically enthralled by and curious about the subject, (2) students have received little if any exposure to the subject in any form of formal classroom environment, and (3) students have personally experienced situations or have learned of situations from their peers that have left them in an uncomfortable position and left them questioning the appropriateness of the actions witnessed. We typically introduce the subject of GeoEthics by drawing students’ attention to the many Codes of Ethics or Professional Conduct assembled by Geoscience societies. Many students are quick to volunteer their experiences related to specific topics. For example, the statement in the Geological Society of America Code of Conduct, “Geoscientists should treat associates with respect, regardless of the level of their formal education, encourage them, learn with them, share ideas honestly, and give credit for their contributions” often incites lively discussion and reveals repeated behavior by some individuals.",

The cold winter water\nventilates the upper halocline and supplies nutrients that fuel\nprimary productivity, while the warm summer waters melt sea ice and\nsupply freshwater to the Beaufort Gyre. Here we use mooring data\ncollected as part of the Arctic Observing Network (AON) to examine the\ninterannual trends in the current over the period 2002-2011.\nStrikingly, the volume transport of the current has decreased by more\nthan 80%, despite the fact that the flow through Bering Strait has\nincreased over this time period. The largest changes have occurred in\nthe summer months. Using atmospheric reanalysis fields and weather\nstation data, we demonstrate that an increase in summer easterly winds\nis the primary cause for the reduction in transport, which is largely\ndictated by the behavior of the two atmospheric centers of action, the\nBeaufort High and Aleutian Low. Using additional mooring and shipboard\ndata, together with satellite fields, we argue that a significant\nportion of the mass and heat passing through Bering Strait in recent\nyears has been advected out of Barrow Canyon into the interior Canada\nBasin - rather than entering the boundary current in the Beaufort Sea\n- where it is responsible for a significant portion of the increased\nsea ice melt in the basin.",

            "abstract": "What is the role of rare events in the exhumation of steep landscapes? We use the “millennial” storm that hit the Front Range, Colorado, USA, in September 2013 to explore this question in a semi-arid landscape. More than 250 mm of rain fell over a ~100 km swath of the Front Range in a 5 day period; totals in some areas exceeded average annual precipitation. The storm triggered over 1300 landslides and debris flows in four major Front Range watersheds (Coe et al., 2014).\nWe created a DEM of difference in the 102 km2 area of overlap using aerial LiDAR surveys, acquired in August 2010 by the Boulder Creek CZO and in November 2013 by FEMA. The study region covers the Boulder Creek watershed from the middle of the Rocky Mountain Surface to the western edge of the Plains, and encompasses Boulder Canyon, Fourmile Canyon, and the 26-km2 2010 Fourmile Canyon Fire. Precambrian crystalline rocks underlie most of the area, although the eastern margin includes sedimentary rocks in hogbacks along the mountain front. We computed site characteristics and volumes for 120 failures.\nWithin the crystalline terrain, most failures occurred at or near the bedrock interface at 0.5-1 m depth, often near the ridgelines downslope of bedrock outcrops. Failures occurred on slopes of 25-40°, and show no slope aspect bias. Failures evolved into debris flows that scoured chutes from the initiation site down to the master stream, traveling at up to 10 m/s. We saw little evidence of deposition; most debris was entrained in the flooding master streams and exited the mountain front. Evacuated sediment volumes represent several hundred years of exhumation within the source basins, based on published long-term erosion rates calculated from 10Be concentrations. We infer that, even in this semi-arid environment, debris flows initiated by rare shallow landslides are a dominant process for evacuating sediment from steep channels and delivering it to the plains.",

            "abstract": "Van Norden meadow in the Donner Summit area west of Lake Tahoe is one of the largest sub-alpine meadows in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. As natural water retention basins, meadows attenuate floods, improve water quality and support vegetation that stabilizes stream banks and promotes high biodiversity. Like most meadows in the Sierras however, over-grazing, road-building, and development has resulted in localized stream incision, degradation, and partial conversion from wet to dry conditions in Van Norden. Additionally, a small dam at the base of the meadow has partially flooded the lower meadow creating reservoir conditions. Privately owned since the late 1800s, Van Norden was recently purchased by a local land trust to prevent further development and return the area to public ownership. Restoration of the natural meadow conditions will involve notching the dam in 2016 to reduce currently impounded water volumes from 250 to less than 50 acre-feet.\nTo monitor the effects of notching the dam on the upstream meadow conditions, better understanding of the surface and groundwater hydrology both pre- and post-restoration is required. We surveyed the meadow in summer 2014 with ground penetrating radar (GPR) to map the groundwater surface prior to restoration activities using a 270MHz antenna to obtain a suite of longitudinal and transverse transects. Groundwater level within the meadow was assessed using both piezometer readings and sweeps of the GPR antenna. Seventeen piezometers were added this year to the 13 already in place to monitor temporal changes in the groundwater surface, while the GPR profiles provided information about lateral variations. Our results provide an estimate of the groundwater depth variations across the upper portion of the meadow before notching. We plan to return in 2015 to collect GPR profiles during wetter conditions, which will provide a more complete assessment of the pre-notching groundwater hydrology.",

            "abstract": "Retrieving the Empirical Green’s function (EGF) between two receivers by cross-correlating continuous records is now a well-recognized technique and the derived EGFs have been applied to various fields in seismology. However, little attention has been given to a more quantitative description on the noise behavior of the noise-derived cross-correlation functions (CCF), for its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be improved easily by increasing the total correlation time. In our early work, using data recorded from Taiwan and Korea, we have designed a procedure to quantify the noises within the noise-derived CCFs and their spatial/directional properties. Because the effective amplitudes and the noise levels of CCFs are closely related to the distribution of the ambient sources and the population of the uncorrelated noises, respectively, here we move forward to further investigate the source mechanisms of the ambient noises by using their distinctive sensitivities to the surrounding sources.\nIt is known that the short period (3~5 seconds) secondary microseisms (SPSM) are much more active in Taiwan Straight and such asymmetric energy excitations are well demonstrated in the amplitude asymmetry of CCFs. Interestingly, we find that, there is nearly no directional dependence of the noise levels of CCFs, namely, the effects of uncorrelated sources in the CCFs are essentially isotropic.\nWith the same data set, we also investigate the excitation mechanisms of (1) the intermediate period (7-9 seconds) microseisms, which are one of the spectral peaks in the ambient noises, and (2) the coda train in the noise-derived CCFs. Based upon our analysis, we argue that (1) the 7~9 period ambient noises are contributed mainly by the near-coast primary microseisms rather than the far-field long period secondary microseisms, and (2) instead of the distant ocean waves, local scatter effects are the major sources of the CCF coda train.",

            "abstract": "Daily atmosphere vapor samples were collected by using a cold trap maintaining in -70℃ during the 2 years of Nov 2011—Nov 2013. The oxygen isotope and hydrogen isotope were measured for all these samples, and were compared with daily precipitation isotopes. We first present the seasonal variations of vapor d18O and deuterium-excess (d-excess). A stable increasing of vapor d18O was found from beginning of the year to the maximum of -10‰ in May, followed by a sharp drop in June with the monsoon incursion. Large fluctuation of d18O marked the monsoon season of June-September, with the lowest d18O reached approximately to -37‰, even lower than in the winter season. The large fluctuation of vapor d18O is related to rainfall events in the rainfall season, which sharp decrease following the precipitation events. D-excess fluctuations in vapor differ from d18O. However, there is an obvious lower d-excess in monsoon precipitation season during June-September. In average, vapor d-excess did not correlate well with d18O. However, in monsoon season (June-September), the correlation is obvious. Vapor d18O shows an positive correlation with vapor pressure in non-monsoon season, but a clear inverse correlation with vapor pressure in monsoon season. Comparing the atmospheric vapor and concurrent precipitation isotopes within one year of parallel observation shows that vapor isotope is 13.0‰ lower than precipitation for d18O, 98.6‰ lower for dD, and 15‰ higher for d-excess.",

            "abstract": "An issue for interpreting exposure ages using cosmogenic nuclides is prior exposure (inheritance), especially for stable nuclides such as Ne-21. In this study we examine the reliability of provenance as a possible tool for determining the degree to which inheritance is an issue for a given sample. We use zircon U/Pb ages, quartz cathodoluminescence imaging, and trace element geochemistry from Antarctic glacial drifts and compare these to zircon, quartz, and trace elements from local bedrock in order to determine the drifts’ origins. This is potentially useful in Ong Valley in the Central Transantarctic Mountains, and likely elsewhere in Antarctica, as Antarctic glacial sediments are only derived either from sources that lie beneath the ice, where it likely had little prior exposure to cosmic rays, or from the relatively small amount of local, exposed bedrock, which would have inherited nuclides. Thus, sediment provenance is likely correlated with its inherited nuclide inventory. The bedrock of Ong Valley is composed of granite (Hope Granite, Granite Harbour Intrusives) and gneiss, and contains three glacial drifts. We collected samples from these three drifts and the surrounding bedrock. Cosmogenic nuclide dating using Ne-21 provides exposure ages for the quartz that can be used to constrain the timing of the glacier’s retreat from the three sites. The accuracy of these three exposure ages depends on the prior (or inherited) exposure of the sediment and its sources. The use of the use of multiple methods for determining provenance allows us to compare the results and see if they reach the same conclusion. If cathodoluminescence imaging proves to be a reliable method for establishing provenance it would provide complementary information for cosmogenic nuclide dating, especially because quartz is significantly more abundant and we would be obtaining coupled provenance information and exposure ages from a single mineral.",

            "abstract": "Teleseismic array back-projection (BP) of high frequency (~1Hz) seismic waves has been recently applied to image the aftershock sequence of the Tohoku-Oki earthquake. The BP method proves to be effective in capturing early aftershocks that are difficult to be detected due to the contamination of the mainshock coda wave. Furthermore, since the event detection is based on the identification of the local peaks in time series of the BP power, the resulting event location corresponds to the peak high-frequency energy rather than the hypocenter. In this work, we show that the comparison between the BP-determined catalog and conventional phase-picking catalog provides estimates of the spatial and temporal offset between the hypocenter and the peak high-frequency radiation. We propose to measure this peak high-frequency shift of global earthquakes between M4.0 to M7.0. We average the BP locations calibrated by multiple reference events to minimize the uncertainty due to the variation of 3D path effects. In our initial effort focusing on the foreshock and aftershock sequence of the 2014 Iquique earthquake, we find systematic shifts of the peak high-frequency energy towards the down-dip direction. We find that the amount of the shift is a good indication of rupture length, which scales with the earthquake magnitude. Further investigations of the peak high frequency offset may provide constraints on earthquake source properties such as rupture directivity, rupture duration, rupture speed, and stress drop.",

            "abstract": "Transition zone discontinuities, among all, hold the key to resolve the mystery of mass and heat transport in the Earth’s mantle and the composition of the Earth’s interior. In previous efforts, the data are limited to either upper mantle triplications, converted waves or mantle reflections (e.g. SS precursors, ScS reverberations). When multiple datasets are jointly analyzed, they are often restrained at relatively long period (~ 0.1 Hz). To complement previous efforts, we advocate a simple and effective strategy to tackle a number of seismic observables altogether. Specifically, we involve broadband direct converted waves (e.g., P410s, P660s) and the topside reflections (the multiples, e.g., PpP410s, PpP660s) in the context of P wave receiver function technique. Such a tactic not only minimizes tradeoffs between velocity and density jumps, but also allows a superior resolution on the sharpness of the boundary and a detailed description of transition zone discontinuities.\nHere we summarize our first attempt in the region of stagnant slab beneath Chinese continent. We processed waveforms from 1000 stations of the Chinese seismic array using an automatic scheme to remove noisy waveforms and retained close to ~300,000 high quality receiver functions in the L-Q-T coordinate system. While avoiding interferences from other mantle waves, we perform slowness stacking of direct converted waves and the multiples, respectively, at several discrete frequency bands between 0.05 Hz and 1Hz and obtain amplitude estimates and uncertainties through the bootstrap method. To properly calibrate the amplitudes of receiver functions, we take into account the effect of incoherent stacking due to discontinuity topography and frequency-dependent attenuation. Our findings indicate that the 410 is a sharp boundary with a small density jump (<< 5 km, ΔVs=5-6%, Δρ=1.5-2%), but there is no significant gradient near the sharp transition. While the 660 is best described by a sharp boundary and a moderate density jump (<< 5 km, ΔVs=3.5-4%, Δρ=4-4.5%), there is a substantial gradient near the boundary (> 3x10-3 km/s/km, > 3x10-3 g/cm3/km). We will discuss the implications of these new findings in the context of thermochemical state of the transition zone in a separate presentation (Song et al. S034: Theory of Earth, this meeting).",

            "abstract": "Tropical wetland forests including mangroves and lowland peat swamp forests contain among the highest carbon stocks of any ecosystem on the planet. This is largely due to the accumulation of deep organic rich soils which have been sequestering carbon for millennia. Depth of organic layers (peats) can exceed 3 m in mangrove and 10 m in the peat swamp forests. The ecosystem carbon stocks may exceed 2000 Mg/ha in mangroves and 5000 Mg/ha in peat swamp forests. Ironically, rates of deforestation of these tropical forests are among the highest in the tropics. With land cover change comes dramatic shifts in carbon stocks, net ecosystem productivity, and greenhouse gas emissions. Land cover change results in carbon losses of practically all aboveground pools as well as losses arising from soil pools. Based upon studies where we have compared stock changes due to land use the carbon emissions arising from land cover change to shrimp ponds and oil palm have ranged from 800-3000 Mg CO2e/ha. The lowered carbon sequestration rates coupled with increased or similar emissions from decomposition results in an ecosystem shift from a carbon sink to a carbon source. Clearly the large carbon stocks, high rates of deforestation, and large emissions resulting from their degradation suggest that these ecosystems should receive great consideration in climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.",

            "abstract": "Geospace drivers like the solar wind speed, interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), and solar irradiance have a strong influence on the density of the thermosphere and the near-Earth space environment. This has important consequences on the drag on satellites that are in low orbit and therefore on their position. One of the basic problems with space weather prediction is that these drivers can only be measured about one hour before they affect the environment. In order to allow for adequate planning for some members of the commercial, military, or civilian communities, reliable long-term space weather forecasts are needed.\nThe study presents a model for predicting geospace drivers up to five days in advance. This model uses the same general technique to predict the solar wind speed, the three components of the IMF, and the solar irradiance F10.7. For instance, it uses Probability distribution functions (PDFs) to relate the current solar wind speed and slope to the future solar wind speed, as well as the solar wind speed to the solar wind speed one solar rotation in the future. The PDF Model has been compared to other models for predictions of the speed. It has been found that it is better than using the current solar wind speed (i.e., persistence), and better than the Wang-Sheeley-Arge Model for prediction horizons of 24 hours.\nOnce the drivers are predicted, and the uncertainty on the drivers are specified, the density in the thermosphere can be derived using various models of the thermosphere, such as the Global Ionosphere Thermosphere Model. In addition, uncertainties on the densities can be estimated, based on ensembles of simulations. From the density and uncertainty predictions, satellite positions, as well as the uncertainty in those positions can be estimated. These can assist operators in determining the probability of collisions between objects in low Earth orbit.",

            "abstract": "Central Chile is a tectonically active, drought-prone region sensitive to latitudinal variations in large-scale cold fronts associated with fluctuations of the Pacific subtropical high. Holocene high-resolution records of climate and volcanic events could help inform more on the frequency of extensive droughts as well as volcanic and seismic hazards. LdM is a high altitude, volcanic lake located in the Transition Southern Volcanic Zone (~36°S, 2200 m.a.s.l). The LdM volcanic field is a very seismically and volcanically active zone in the Andes, with several caldera-forming eruptions over the last 1.5 Ma, and intense postglacial activity.\nIn 2013, we recovered over 40 m of sediment cores at four sites of LdM and collected > 20 km of seismic lines. The cores were imaged, their physical and geochemical properties analysed with a Geotek MSCL and XRF scanner respectively, and sampled for TOC, TIC, TS, TN, BioSi, and bulk mineralogy. The chronology was constructed with a Bayesian age-depth model including 210Pb-137Cs, the Quizapú volcanic ash (1932 AD) and 17 AMS 14C dates. The 4.8 m long composite sequence spans the Late glacial and Holocene.\nSediments are massive to banded, quartz and plagioclase-rich silts with variable diatom (BioSi, 15- 30 %) and organic matter content (TOC, 1–5 %). Four main units have been defined based on sedimentological and geochemical composition. The transition from Unit 4 to 3 is ascribed to the onset of the Holocene; Unit 2 spans the mid Holocene, and Unit 1 the last 4 ka. Higher (lower) TOC, Br/Ti and Fe/Mn ratios in units 1 and 3 (2 and 4) suggest higher (lower) organic productivity in the lake and dominant oxic (anoxic) conditions at the bottom of the lake. Up to 17 ash and lapilli layers mark volcanic events, mostly grouped in units 1 and 3. Periods of higher lake productivity (units 1 and 3) are synchronous to higher frequency of volcanic events. Some climate transitions (LIA, 4ka, 8ka and 11ka) are evident in the LdM sequence underlining their paleohydrological regional significance.",

            "abstract": "The extent to which forest growth is limited by carbon (C) supply (source control) or by cambial activity (sink control) will strongly determines the responses of trees to global changes. However, the physiological processes responsible for the limitation of forest growth are still under debate. The aim of this study was i) to evaluate the key drivers of the annual carbon allocation to wood along large soil and climate regional gradients in four tree species representative of the main European forest biomes (Fagus sylvatica, Quercus petraea, Quercus ilex and Picea abies) ii) to implement the identified key drivers in a new C allocation scheme within the CASTANEA terrestrial biosphere model (TBM). Combining field measurements and process-based simulations at 49 sites (931 site-years), our analyses revealed that the inter-site variability in C allocation to wood was predominantly driven by an age-related decline. The direct control of temperature or water stress on sink activity (i.e. independently from their effects on C supply) exerted a strong influence on the annual woody growth in all the species considered, including deciduous temperate species. The lagged effect of the past environment conditions was a significant driver of the annual C allocation to wood. Carbon supply appeared to strongly limit growth only in deciduous temperate species. Our study supports the premise that European forest growth is under a complex panel of source- and sink- limitations, contradicting the simple source control implemented in most TBMs. The implementation of these combined forest growth limitations in the CASTANEA model significantly improved its performance when evaluated against independent stand growth data at the regional scale (mainland France, >103 plots). We finally discuss how the sink imitation affects the CASTANEA simulated projections of forest productivity along the 21th century, especially with respect to the expected fertilizing effect of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration. The new C allocation scheme will allow refining the projections of the impacts of global changes on forest growth, with implications on the predicted evolution of the forest C sink, forest dieback and tree species distributions.",

Satellite images of the auroral oval and all-sky camera observations of 630.0 nm airglow patches superimposed onto SuperDARN convection maps, reveals a detailed picture on how patches exiting the polar cap and return to the dayside at night, on both the dusk convection cell and the dawn convection cell. We also present eight years of statistics demonstrating that the MLT distribution of patch exits are marginally affected by the IMF BY polarity 3-4 hours around midnight. Synthesizing our observations with previous results there are two, possibly related, explanations to why patches populate both convection cells almost symmetrically. i) Intake of patch material occur on both convection cells for both IMF BY polarities. ii) According to the patch formation model by Lockwood and Carlson et al. [1992] the excitation of flow associated with transient dayside reconnection produces cigar-shaped patches stretching across both the morning and the evening convection cells. Applying the dynamic polar cap flow model by Cowley and Lockwood [1992], we suggest that dawn-dusk elongated patches may be torn apart at night when they are grabbed by transient tail reconnection. The associated twin cell flow disturbance expanding from the reconnection region will divert plasma towards dawn and dusk. This may explain the observed exits on both convection cells.",

The economic value of the Mekong fishery in Lao PDR, Cambodia and Vietnam is among the highest in the world, providing income and food security to tens of millions of people. However, the construction of multiple dams in the basin will reduce sediment discharge, which will adversely impact nutrient transport and habitat quality and availability, and disrupt fish migration routes. Thus, of considerable interest is the identification of alternatives to the location, design and operation of planned hydropower dams that could improve sediment passage, enable migratory fish passage, and sustain fish production for local use. This paper describes the results of simulation studies designed to identify and evaluate such alternatives, as well as their potential impact on hydropower production. Dam sites in Cambodia and Lao PDR on tributaries and on the mainstream Mekong River will be discussed. Evaluations of sediment management techniques such as flushing, sluicing and bypassing will be discussed. This study is intended to inform decision makers in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Vietnam about potential alternatives to current plans as they prepare decisions regarding the development of over 100 hydropower dams throughout the basin.",

            "abstract": "The Panzhihua, Hongge and Baima mafic-ultramafic layered intrusions host three giant Fe-Ti oxide deposites in the Pangzhihua-Xichang (Panxi) region, SW China. Various proportions of silicates (plagioclase, pyroxene and olivine), ilmenite and magnitite form rhythmic layering in the upper part of the intrusions. The origin of rhythmic layering in mafic-ultramafic layered intrusions has been debated for a long time in the literatures. Here we provide detailed FTIR and EBSD studies on the water content and deformation microstructure of gabbros from the Panzhihua intrusion. The FTIR analyses revealed a significant amount of hydroxyls in both clinopyroxene (411-775 ppm) and plagioclase (328-716 ppm), suggesting a high water content mantle plume source. The EBSD analyses show: 1) a weak clinopyroxene fabric of (100) parallel to foliation and [001] parallel to lineation; 2) a strong plagioclase fabric of (010) parallel to foliation and [100] parallel to lineation; 3) a weak ilmenite fabric of (001) parallel to foliation and [hk0] parallel to lieantion; 4) a near random magnitite fabric. These results suggest weak plagioclase is the main strain accommedation phase in lower crustal rocks under hydrous conditions, which is also consistent with previous deformation experiments on plagioclase and clinoproxene. Water plays an important role in deteriming the rheology contrast between plagioclase and clinoproxene. Our results revealed strong layer-parallel shearing deformation during the formation of the Panxi layered intrusions. We propose that the formation of the rhythmic layering is mainly caused by rheological stratification rather than chemical stratification of Fe-Ti oxides and gabbros.",

            "abstract": "Submerged tropical karst features were discovered in Nagura Bay on Ishigaki Island in the South Ryukyu Islands, Japan. This is the first description of submerged humid tropical karst using multibeam bathymetry. We conducted a broadband multibeam survey in the central area of Nagura Bay (1.85 × 2.7 km) and visualized the high-resolution bathymetric results with a grid size of 1 m over a depth range of 1.6–58.5 m. Various types of humid tropical karst landforms were found to coexist within the bay, including fluviokarst, doline karst, cockpit karst, polygonal karst, uvalas, and mega-dolines.\nWe assume that Nagura Bay was a large karst basin in which older limestone remained submerged, thus preventing corrosion and the accumulation of reef sediments during periods of submersion, whereas the limestone outcropping on land was corroded during multiple interglacial and glacial periods. Based on our bathymetric result together with aerial photographs of the coastal area, we conclude that the submerged karst landscape has likely developed throughout the whole of Nagura Bay, covering an area of ~6 × 5 km. Accordingly, this area hosts the largest submerged karst in Japan.\nWe also observed abundant coral communities during our SCUBA observations. The present marine conditions of Nagura Bay are characterized by low energy (calm sea) and low irradiance owing to the terrestrial influence. Such conditions have been emphasized by the presence of large undulating landforms, which cause decreases in wave intensity and irradiance with depth. These characteristics have acted to establish unique conditions compared to other coral reef areas in the Ryukyu Islands. It may play an important role in supporting the regional coral reef ecosystem.",

            "abstract": "While the capacity of both electromagnetic induction (EMI) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) to monitor shallow soil moisture dynamics has been extensively examined, there have been few studies comparing the results of these two techniques. These comparative studies have primarily treated ERT as the more reliable method and focussed on the potential shortcoming (i.e., calibration and stability) of EMI devices. Further, these studies have been very limited in terms of their duration and the range of soil moisture conditions observed.\nConcurrent EMI and ERT surveys we acquired during a 36-month period to monitor changes in shallow moisture conditions at a clayey vineyard located in Vineland, Ontario, Canada is an excellent data set for such a comparison between these geoelectrical techniques. A wide range of soil moisture conditions were encountered during this monitoring program including wet spring and fall, dry summer, and frozen winter periods. Also, the effects of variations in hydrological processes between contrasting annual cycles (e.g., wet versus dry summer conditions) can be seen in these hydrogeophysical data. In addition, procedures were followed during the EMI data acquisition to minimize calibration and stability issues.\nWe found very good agreement between these two geoelectrical techniques during the relatively wet conditions during fall to spring period. However, there is significant deviation between these methods during the summer period with the EMI data indicating less conductive (i.e., drier) conditions than the ERT data. This deviation is larger for the EMI horizontal dipole data, indicating that the source of this discrepancy is located in shallow near-surface. In addition, the comparison of gravimetric soil moisture measurements with both geoelectrical data sets shows a substantially better correlation between soil moisture and the EMI data, implying that there are significant limitations with the ERT technique in this application. The results of modelling and additional ERT surveys indicate that very short electrode spacings are required to adequately characterize the thin, highly resistive surface layer where desiccation cracking was observed. Hence, we have concluded that EMI methods are better suited for monitoring soil moisture dynamics in this system.",

            "abstract": "The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) contains just 1% of the world’s freshwater; however, even in the very arid countries of the Gulf region, high quality treated wastewater rarely sees a productive use. As countries deal with growing populations and strive for increased food security, freshwater alone cannot be relied upon to meet these demands. This research identifies best practices from the MENA for reusing treated wastewater in agricultural production, and calculates the potential of treated wastewater for increasing food production in select countries. Drawing upon both published and original treated wastewater quality data for locations in the MENA, the annual volume of treated wastewater produced, and crop water demands, estimates for potential crop production from treated wastewater are calculated. The volume of wastewater treated annually is equivalent to 10-40% of agricultural withdrawals in most MENA countries. Irrigation by treated wastewater has significant potential to impact water and food security by reducing agricultural water withdrawals and increasing domestic food production. Such initiatives require application of best management practices, such as transparent monitoring and evaluation of reuse projects for public and environmental health risks, and support from both farmers and policy makers.",

            "abstract": "Many probability distributions have been proposed for flood frequency analysis and several criteria have been used for selecting a best fitted distribution to an observed or generated data set by some random process. The upper tail of flood frequency distribution should be specifically concerned for flood control. However, different model selection criteria often result in different optimal distributions when focus on upper tail of flood frequency distribution. In this study, with emphasis on the upper-tail behavior, 5 distribution selection criteria including 2 hypothesis tests and 3 information-based criteria are evaluated in selecting the best fitted distribution from 8 widely used distributions (Pearson 3, Log-Pearson 3, two-parameter lognormal, three-parameter lognormal, Gumbel, Weibull, Generalized extreme value and Generalized logistic distributions) by using datasets from Thames River (UK), Wabash River (USA), Beijiang River and Huai River (China), which are all within latitude of 23.5-66.5 degrees north. The performance of the 5 selection criteria is verified by using a composite criterion focus on upper tail events defined in this study. This paper shows the approach for the optimal selection of suitable flood frequency distributions for different river basins. Results illustrate that (1) Different distributions are selected by using hypothesis tests and information-based criteria for each river. (2) The information-based criteria perform better than hypothesis tests in most cases when the focus is on the goodness of predictions of the extreme upper tail events. (3) In order to decide on a particular distribution to fit the high flow, it would be better to use the combination criteria, in which the information-based criteria can be used first to rank the models and the results are inspected by hypothesis testing methods. In addition, if the information-based criteria and hypothesis tests provide different results, the composite criterion will be taken for final decision.",

            "abstract": "The relationship between the onset of Pi2 pulsations in ground magnetometers and substorm onset has been used extensively over the years to determine when and where substorm onset takes place. However, there are still many questions concerning how and where the Pi2 pulsations themselves are generated, how they propagate through the system, and their relationship to flow bursts in the plasma sheet.\nIn order to investigate Pi2 generation and propagation through the magnetosphere, and their relationship to bursty flows, we have modeled a substorm on 14-Sep-2004 using both the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM) and the UCLA 3D global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models. By using two different models we show that the perturbations develop as a result of the equations, and do not depend on the set-up or numerical methods used in a particular model. The results from both models show that, in the braking region, the region where flows are slowed as they approach the inner edge of the plasma sheet, Pi2 period pulsations develop in the magnetic field, velocity, and pressure, concurrently with the arrival of fast earthward flows and their associated dipolarization fronts. The disturbance generated by the fast flows at the inner edge of the plasma sheet creates Alfvén waves that map to auroral regions and compressional waves that propagate deeper into the inner magnetosphere. The fast flows also generate Pi2 period fluctuations in the field aligned currents at the inner edge of the plasma sheet and in the inner magnetosphere.",

The network is composed of 40 stations 27 of which have 3-component sensors. We use Vertical-to-Vertical (ZZ) cross-correlation components from all stations and Radial-to-Radial (RR) and Transverse-to-Transverse (TT) cross-correlations computed from 3-component records. The group velocity dispersion curves for Rayleigh and Love waves are measured using a Frequency-Time Analysis. We average measurements from ZZ and RR components to finally obtain 577 Rayleigh-wave dispersion curves. 395 Love-wave dispersion curves are obtained from the TT cross-correlations. We then regionalize the group velocities measurements to construct 2D dispersion maps at a set of periods between 0.4 and 8 s. Finally, we construct a 3D shear-velocity model down to 3 km below the sea level by jointly inverting the Rayleigh and Love wave group velocity maps with a Neighborhood Algorithm and with taking into account the radial anisotropy.\nThe distribution of 3-D Voigt averaged S-wave velocities shows three distinct high-velocity anomalies surrounded by a low-velocity ring. The most western high-velocity anomaly is located below the actual \"Plaine des Sables\" and could be attributed to an old intrusive body at the location of the former volcanic center before it migrated toward its present location. The second high-velocity body is located below the summit of the volcano and likely corresponds to the actual preferential dyke intrusion zone as highlighted by the seismicity. The third high-velocity anomaly is located below the \"Grandes Pentes\" and the \"Grand Brûlé\" areas and is thought to be an imprint of the solidified magma chamber of the ancient dismantled “Les Alizé” volcano. The distribution of the radial anisotropy shows two main anomalies: a positive anisotropy (Vsh>Vsv) above sea level highlighting the recent edifice of Piton de la Fournaise with an accumulation of mostly horizontal lava flows, and the second one below the sea level with a negative anisotropy (Vsv>Vsh) showing the ancient edifice of the Piton de la Fournaise dominated by intrusions of vertical dykes.",

            "abstract": "Very few data exist to describe geomagnetic field behaviour in the Late Devonian (LD). Samples, which have recently been Ar-Ar dated to 364-377 Myr ago, of LD-aged volcanics and instrusives from the Viluy large igneous province in Siberia are investigated. These units have already demonstrated reliable, palaeomagnetic directions consistent with the retention of a primary remanence. Microwave Thellier-type palaeointensity experiments (mostly IZZI protocol with partial thermoremanent magnetization checks) were performed on 55 samples from 16 sites, of which, 12 samples from 4 sites provide satisfactory paleointensity data. Arai plots are strongly concave-up in shape but multiple lines of evidence support that this is caused by a strong component of magnetisation overprinting a weak primary magnetisation rather than by lab-induced alteration or multidomain behaviour. The samples display corresponding distinct directional components, positive pTRM checks and little or no zig-zagging of the Arai plot. Furthermore, the results of non-heating pseudo-Thellier experiments support the existence of a strong component overprinting a much weaker one. The site-mean paleointensities, ranging from 5.3-11.1 µT and which correspond to a virtual axial dipole moments (VADMs) of (1.0-2.1) ×1022 Am2, indicate that the LD was a time of extremely weak magnetic field intensity. It provides the evidence that the superchron state, between ~310 and 265 Myr ago, is preceded by very weak field in the LD (~60 Myr before the superchron). If low dipole moment can be considered an indicator of high reversal frequency (as appears to be the case in the mid-Jurassic) then our results support that rapid transitions between reversal hyperactivity and superchron states are a recurring feature in the palaeomagnetic record, potentially linked to simultaneous episodes of true polar wander.",

            "abstract": "Being multidisciplinary, while admired, is not viewed as a goal of education. Instead, extreme specialization is emphasized. One seeks to attain mastery of a given subject, but at what cost? Even those fields viewed as “interdisciplinary” are often quite narrow in scope, only permitting the most closely related subjects to coalesce. The arts however, are by nature both inter- and multi-disciplinary. They attempt to research, analyze, and reflect upon broader questions, often employing techniques garnered from far-flung fields in order to do so. It is an unfortunate dilemma then that the artist should seem so separate from the scientist, as it seems that both are engaged in a sort of hypothesis testing. Perhaps this division is a remnant of the antiquated left- and right-brained dichotomy, which clearly separated the two groups: Science and Art, Left and Right. In this way, the artist was branded as Science’s “other,” despite the inherent sameness of their processes. This “otherness” has been carried forward to the present, where artists are often viewed as simply craftspeople -object makers- and the concept of the “artistic problem” is rarely considered. As someone possessing degrees in both Fine Art and Hydrology, the author attempts to explain the connection between the two subjects, and the manner in which they compliment and enlighten each other in her own research. She hypothesizes that in addition to this “otherness,” it is the multi-dimensional mode of thinking and dealing with problems that sets the artist apart. But this is a dynamic trait, and as such, it should be considered that by approaching scientific endeavors as artistic problems, the researcher could be permitted a broader framework in which to answer a given scientific question.",

PASSCAL was part of a coordinated plan proposed to the National Science Foundation (NSF) defining the instrumentation, data collection and management structure to support a wide range of research in seismology. The PASSCAL program has surpassed the early goal of 6000 data acquisition channels with a current inventory of instrumentation capable of imaging from the near surface to the inner core. Here we present the evolution of the PASSCAL program from instrument depot to full service community resource.\nPASSCAL has supported close to 1100 PI driven seismic experiments since its inception. Instruments from PASSCAL have covered the globe and have contributed over 7400 SEED stations and 242 assembled data sets to the IRIS Data Management Center in Seattle. Since the combination in 1998 of the Stanford and Lamont instrument centers into the single PASSCAL Instrument Center (PIC) at New Mexico Tech, the facility has grown in scope by adding the EarthScope Array Operations Facility in 2005, the incorporation of the EarthScope Flexible Array, and a Polar support group in 2006. The polar support group enhances portable seismic experiments in extremely harsh polar environments and also extends to special projects such as the Greenland Ice Sheet Monitoring Network (GLISN) and the recent development effort for Geophysical Earth Observatory for Ice Covered Environments (GEOICE). Through these support efforts the PIC has established itself as a resource for field practices, engineered solutions for autonomous seismic stations, and a pioneer in successful seismic recording in polar environments.\nWe are on the cusp of a new generation of instrumentation driven in part by the academic community’s desire to record unaliased wavefields in multiple frequency bands and industry’s interest in utilizing lower frequency data. As part of the recently funded IRIS proposal to NSF for support of Seismological Facilities for the Advancement of Geoscience and EarthScope (SAGE), IRIS is developing plans for this new instrumentation that will ensure that the PASSCAL program continues to provide state-of-the-art observing capabilities into the coming decades.",

The aim of this study was to identify essential oil content, its chemical composition, and antioxidant activity in the N. glomerulosa during vegetative, flowering and seed set stages. The samples of N. glomerulosa in the three above-mentioned stages were collected from Abade region of Fars Province.

Essential oil of the plant in vegetative, flowering and seed set stages were measured to be 55, 53 and 53 components, respectively, with geranyl acetate (16.644%, 18.182% and 24.441%), geraniol (10.797%, 11.372% and 12.389%), caryophyllene oxide (8.302%, 10.515% and 6.661%), humulene epoxide ΙΙ (7.974%, 7.112% and 2.587%), α-pinene (4.743%, 4.126% and 6.724%), limonene (4.086%, 3.848% and 4.711%) and 1,8-cineol (3.397%, 4.609% and 3.759%) being the major components of the essential oil. The results confirmed that phonological stages have a significant effect on essential oils constituents. Geranyl acetate and geraniol increased by development of plant from vegetative to seed set stage and geranyl acetate was the main essential oils constituent of the plants throughout the three phonological stages. Antioxidant activity in flowering and seed set stages was significantly higher than vegetative stage, but compared with Gallic acid, which is a very strong antioxidant substance, had insignificant antioxidant activity.",

These algorithms are especially effective if the original information (such as gravity anomaly) is known at the grid points. Thanks to the GOCE mission, there were obtained the discrete values of gravity anomalies at a regular grid over the entire surface of the Earth, so it is possible to use the Stokes’ integral to calculate the height anomaly of large areas or even across the whole surface of the Earth.\nThe paper substantiates the possibility of using the one-dimensional Fourier transform on the sphere, presents the results of calculation of the Stokes’ integral using 1D spherical FFT technique. In the method presented, the one-dimensional Fourier transform is applied to the kernel of the integral specified and application in the west-east direction, combined with the summation over the parallels. Stokes’ kernel presents singularities at the origin. In order to deal with this problem, a value of zero is forced at the origin when we are using FFT, and after the computations are done, the value for the origin has to be restored.\nFor arrays of large-size data, this method requires more computer time than the two-dimensional spherical FFT, but it is much faster than pointwise integration. Besides, this method allows substitution calculations to be done, which saves considerably the computer memory.",

            "abstract": "The Triassic Period (251.9-201.3 Ma) is bound by two of the Earth’s largest mass extinctions, suffered several giant bolide impacts and eruption of 3 large igneous provinces, and witnessed evolution of the main components of modern tetrapod communities, and yet has sparse geochronological calibration. To bridge this gap, NSF- and ICDP-funded coring of Phase 1 of the CPCP finished in 12/2013 with the recovery of two major cores (1A, 518m and 2B, 253m; 31km apart) from opposites sides of Petrified Forest National Park spanning nearly the entire Triassic sequence (Chinle & Moenkopi fms) with many U-Pb datable levels (1,2,3) and a recoverable paleomagnetic polarity record (4). The cores will provide a U-Pb and paleomagnetic exportable time scale and sedimentary and geochemical proxies with undoubted superposition testing the motivating hypotheses of: 1) the accuracy of orbitally-paced cyclicity of the Newark APTS (5); 2) apparent climate trends as a function of drift through climate belts (6) and atmospheric CO2 (7); 3) the temporal link between the mid-Late Triassic biotic turnover and the ~100 km Manicouagan impact (1); and 4) the delayed ecological dominance of dinosaurs coupled to climate-driven provinciality (1,8). For orientation, the cores were drilled using a azimuth-tracking device, deviated 30° and 15° from vertical to the SE and S, and CT-scanned. The unprecedented sedimentological and stratigraphic detail visible in the CT-scans, and geophysical logs, plus the ~100% recovery promises successful tests of the motivating hypotheses and provide a superbly detailed reference section for this key episode in Earth system history.\n1, Irmis+,2011, EPSL 309:258; 2, Ramazani+, 2011, GSA Bull. 123:2142; 3, Ramazani+, 2014, AJS 314:981; 4, Steiner & Lucas, 2000, JGR B 105:25791; 5, Kent & Olsen, 1999, JGR 104(B6):12831-12841; 6, Kent and Tauxe, 2005, Science 307:240–244; 7, Schaller+, 2012, EPSL 323-324:27–39; 8, Kent +, 2014, PNAS 111:7958–7963.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the formation and history of sediments is a fundamental aspect of geologic research. The abundance of quartz makes the mineral an important component of continentally-derived sediments, yet most sedimentary provenance studies rely on minerals that generally exist in low abundance in both clastic sediments and source rocks. Quartz crystallizes over a wide range of geologic conditions— from low temperature α-quartz (e.g., veins) to the high temperature and pressure α- and β-quartz stability limits in igneous and metamorphic regimes. The diversity of quartz-forming environments is reflected in similarly unique trace-element signatures (notably Ti and Al) in quartz. The Ti and Al content of quartz can therefore be used to determine the original quartz-forming environments and provenance of grains that have been weathered from their parent rocks. Here we demonstrate the efficacy of quartz-based provenance research with a case study from the Bega River Catchment in New South Wales, Australia.\nBedrock in the Bega River catchment is composed primarily of pera- to metaluminous granitoids, while bedrock outside of the basin is mainly peraluminous and peralkaline granitoids. Quartz from these different granitoids display unique trace-element signatures that can be used to fingerprint sediments derived from them. Trace-element composition of quartz grains from sand in the Bega River catchment indicate that ~69.5 % (n=193) of the quartz population is derived from weathering of pera-metaluminous granitoids. This observation is consistent with the bedrock geology of the catchment and suggests that most of the quartz grains in the sediment load of the Bega River are derived from weathering of granitoids within the basin. The remaining quartz population is composed of 24.5 % (n=68) peralkaline granitoid and 6 % (n=17) low-Ti quartz, suggesting granitoids from within the basin are not the sole contributor to the basin’s sedimentary load.",

            "abstract": "Despite the fact that acoustic methods are inexpensive, robust and simple, the application of seismic waves to snow has been sparse. This might be due to the strong attenuation inherent to snow that prevents large scale seismic applications or due to the somewhat counterintuitive acoustic behavior of snow as a porous material. Such materials support a second kind of compressional wave that can be measured in fresh snow and which has a decreasing wave velocity with increasing density of snow. To investigate wave propagation in snow we construct a Biot-type porous model of snow as a function of porosity based on the assumptions that the solid frame is build of ice, the pore space is filled with a mix of air, or air and water, and empirical relationships for the tortuosity, the permeability, the bulk, and the shear modulus.\nWe use this reduced model to investigate compressional and shear wave velocities of snow as a function of porosity and to asses the consequences of liquid water in the snowpack on acoustic wave propagation by solving Biot’s differential equations with plain wave solutions. We find that the fast compressional wave velocity increases significantly with increasing density, but also that the fast compressional wave velocity might be even lower than the slow compressional wave velocity for very light snow.\nBy using compressional and shear strength criteria and solving Biot’s differential equations with a pseudo-spectral approach we evaluate snow failure due to acoustic waves in a heterogeneous snowpack, which we think is an important mechanism in triggering avalanches by explosives as well as by skiers.\nFinally, we developed a low cost seismic acquisition device to assess the theoretically obtained wave velocities in the field and to explore the possibility of an inexpensive tool to remotely gather snow water equivalent.",

            "abstract": "A series of low magnitude earthquakes in North Texas near Azle, Texas began 5-Nov 2013 and continues to the present. By 3-Jan 2014, hypocenters based on a temporary local network were sufficiently well defined to plan an experiment using a dense network near the epicenters. On 25-Feb 2014, NodalSeismic in cooperation with Southern Methodist University, installed and operated 130 vertical 10 Hz recorders distributed along three lines within a few km of the epicenters and collected 10 days of continuous seismic recording at 500 samples/second. Data was converted from SEGD to standard earthquake seismological formats (SEED) for processing.\nDuring the time of the high density recording, relatively few events in the Azle area were detected by the 12 station local network; however, correlation processing on the dense network detected over 100 events. In addition regional events from local quarries as well as a teleseism were well recorded. One of the 10Hz recorders was within 50m of a 1 Hz vertical seismometer, providing the ability to evaluate the utility of the high frequency geophones for recording broader band signals. By comparing catalogs from the local network with detection lists from the high density network, the detection threshold for the augmented network is determined. Delta time offsets for the teleseismic signal may be used to determine relative station corrections (static offsets) prior to fitting classical hyperbola to a velocity model and to estimate epicenters. Comparison between dense network location results and results using standard techniques on the 12 station local network provides an assessment of the utility of this high density technique to quickly evaluate areas where induced seismicity is suspected. Finally, the method provides an opportunity to compare background noise levels between the rapidly installed low cost exploration systems and the more carefully deployed local network.",

            "abstract": "In central Turkey, the Anatolian plate is actively being pushed by Arabian plate convergence in the east and pulled by Hellenic arc retreat to the west; however, there is also ample evidence of internal plate deformation. This region provides an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the transition from collisional (eastern Anatolia) to escape tectonics (western Anatolia). The Continental Dynamics: Central Anatolian Tectonics (CD-CAT) experiment, consists of a dense array of 71 broadband seismometers that span nearly all of Central Anatolia, including the Central Anatolian Fault Zone (CAFZ), Tauride Mountains, North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ), and East Anatolian Fault Zone (EAFZ). We use over 5 months of continuous seismic data to locate earthquake hypocenters in the CAFZ and surrounding region using Hypoellipse. Over 135 local events were detected during analysis of the first month of data. We have developed and calibrated an automated triggering algorithm to automatically detect events throughout our network. By comparing solutions with the Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute, we have also tested the effects of using a variety of 1-D velocity models on the hypocentral distribution and find most solutions to be relatively stable for hypocenters within the center of our network. Preliminary results show clustering of events along the EAF, as expected; however, the CAFZ, generally considered to be less seismically active, also shows a significant amount of seismic activity that is consistent with internal plate deformation. Additional seismicity is observed along the NAF, and near volcanically active regions of central Anatolia. These local earthquake hypocenters will help constrain crustal deformation patterns as well as crustal scale magma bodies that are associated with the volcanic activity in central Anatolia. We also plan to combine local event locations with regional events to measure seismic attenuation across central Anatolia.",

            "abstract": "The great 1762 Arakan earthquake caused subsidence and uplift along 700km of the Arakan coast, and is thought to derive from a huge megathrust rupture reaching northward onto the southeastern coast of Bangladesh. Paleoseismic investigations were conducted in that area to document effects of that and prior earthquakes. U/Th ages obtained from isochron analysis of uplifted dead coral heads of the Poritesspecies, collected along a south to north transect from the islands east coast reveal at least three growth interruptions caused by abrupt relative sea-level changes within the past 1300 years that we interpret to be associated with megathrust ruptures. The ages show distinct events approximately 250, 900 and 1300 years ago. The youngest of these events corresponds to the 1762 Great Arakan earthquake. The two prior events at ~1100 and 700 AD, suggest an average recurrence interval of 400-600 years.\nAlong the coast of Teknaf, we mapped a ~2m uplifted terrace. Marine shells on top of the terrace dated with C-14 at 1695-1791 AD link the uplift to the 1762 Great Arakan earthquake. Based on this evidence and previous work (Wang et al., 2013 and Aung et al., 2008), we estimated the 1762 rupture to be at least 700 km long, from Chebuda Island to the Sitakund anticline encompassing the Teknaf Peninsula. Considering 14 mm/yr convergence rate and 400-600 yrs recurrence interval, this rupture zone has now accumulated elastic deformation to generate a M~8.4 earthquake, close to the M8.8 estimated by Cummins (2007) for the 1762 earthquake. Published recurrence intervals based on C-14 ages along the Myanmar coast ~90 km south of Bangladesh reveal three ruptures within the last 3400 years with an average recurrence interval of 1000-2000 years (Aung et al., 2008). While the 1762 rupture reached across both areas, some of the prior ruptures may be confined to one or the other of these areas, with a smaller magnitude.\nOur precise U-Th ages provide evidence of recurrence intervals of great megathrust earthquakes along the Arakan subduction zone, which is first to be proposed for historic and prehistoric earthquakes along the coast of Bangladesh. It is critical to constrain the recurrence interval and size of these earthquakes for better hazard assessment, given that three densely populated and structurally unplanned cities are near the rupture zone.",

            "abstract": "Low flows are a seasonal hydrologic response generally during a drying period. Extreme low flows are a result of prolonged antecedent precipitation deficit and/or high evaporative demand, and can indicate hydrological droughts (water availability deficit) and ecological droughts (water quality degradation). Human impacts (e.g. dams, reservoirs, and power plants) also play a role in exacerbating the severity of low flow droughts. For drought mitigation, it is critical to better understand how low flows vary over time and their generating mechanisms. The goals of this study are to examine trends in low flows over the eastern U.S. and to assess their attributions and teleconnections in the context of climate change and variability.\nWe selected 149 out of 4878 USGS stations over the eastern U.S., taking into account data availability and minimal human impacts. We analyzed annual 7-day low flows (Q7) from the series of daily streamflow records for 1962-2011. We also computed an antecedent precipitation (AP) over the corresponding basin for each station. We found a north-south (increasing-decreasing) dipole pattern in Q7 trends and a monopole (increasing) pattern in AP trends, which indicates a gap between the trends of Q7 and AP over the southern part of the study region (Virginia, North and South Carolina). We found that these regions show significant increasing trends in potential evapotranspiration (PET) as driven by increasing temperatures and vapor pressure deficit. We also examined teleconnections between detrended Q7 and nine atmospheric and oceanic climate indices. We found that the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Pacific North America (PNA) pattern show prediction skill for Q7 at one and two month lead time, respectively. Our findings suggest that the worst scenario for future droughts over the eastern U.S. is a combination of a response to an increasing trend in temperature driving PET with strong negative NAO and positve PNA during summer.",

            "abstract": "Compaction bands are among the most elusive forms of strain localization, especially for what concerns the applicability of laboratory measurements to field problems. It is therefore pivotal to integrate experiments, analytical theories and computational methods to explain laboratory observations and predict the expected strain localization modes for field-specific conditions. Based on this idea, here we provide a mechanistic interpretation of the compaction banding patterns observed in a high-porosity carbonate rock. Such interpretation has been based on an elastoplastic model able to capture the phenomenology of rock deformation in the brittle-ductile transition regime. Data from several axisymmetric stress paths and the strain localization theory have been used to calibrate the model parameters. The model has been then implemented into a finite element code to predict the global response of rock specimens, as well as the characteristics of the localization patterns. The study shows that stress paths able to engage the plastic resources of the rock alter irreversibly the compaction banding potential and affect the geometric features of the deformation bands. Since these effects depend on the constitutive properties, they can be conveniently used to improve the parameter calibration procedure and reduce the number of experiments. The simulations have also shown that specific combinations of boundary conditions and initial heterogeneity exert an important control on the pattern of localized compaction emerging from laboratory experiments. As a result, the interpretation of such localization modes may not be necessarily regarded as a pure product of the constitutive response, but rather as the outcome of interactions between structural effects, boundary conditions, heterogeneities and rock properties.",

            "abstract": "In the Nordic seas, conversion of inflowing warm Atlantic surface water to deep cold water through convection is closely linked with climate. During the last glacial period climate underwent rapid millennial-scale variability known as Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events, consisting of warm interstadials and cold stadials. Here we present the first benthic foraminiferal Mg/Ca–d18O record from the Nordic seas in order to reconstruct the ocean circulation on DO timescales. The record confirms that modern-like convection took place in the Nordic seas during interstadials with cold bottom water temperatures (BWT) close to modern temperatures. The results show gradual and pronounced BWT increases by 2–5 °C during stadials indicating a stop or near-stop in convection. The BWT peaks are followed by an abrupt drop in temperature at the onset of interstadials indicating the abrupt start of convection and renewed generation of cold deep water. The rise in BWT during stadials confirms earlier interpretations of subsurface inflow of warm Atlantic water below a halocline reaching >1.2 km water depth. The results suggest that warm Atlantic Water never ceased to flow into the Nordic seas during the glacial period with inflow at the surface during the Holocene and warm interstadials switching to subsurface and intermediate inflow during cold stadials. Our results suggest that it is the vertical shifts in the position of the warm Atlantic Water that cause the abrupt surface warmings.",

The measured presence of organic species in the resulting plume, the finding that the jet activity is valved by tidal stretching at apocrone, the modeled lifetime of E-ring particles, and gravitational inference of a long-lived, deep, large water reservoir all indicate that the textbook conditions for habitability are met at Enceladus today: liquid water, biologically available elements, source of energy, and longevity of conducive conditions. Enceladus may be the best place in our solar system to search for direct evidence of biomarkers, and the plume provides a way to sample, analyze, and even return them to Earth for detailed analysis.\nFor example, it is straightforward to define a Stardust-like, fly-through, plume ice-particle, dust, and gas collection mission. Concept engineering and evaluation indicate that the associated technical, programmatic, regulatory, and cost issues are quite unlike the Stardust precedent however, not least because of such a mission’s Category-V, Restricted Earth Return, classification.\nThe poster presents a strategic framework for systematic integration of the enabling issues: cultivation of science advocacy, resolution of diverse stakeholder concerns, development of verifiable and affordable technical solutions, validation of cost estimation methods, alignment with other candidate astrobiology missions, complementarity of international agency goals, and finally the identification of appropriate research and flight-mission opportunities. A strategic approach is essential if we are to know the astrobiological state of Enceladus in our lifetime, and two international teams are already dedicated to implementing key steps on this roadmap.",

            "abstract": "A striking feature of paleoclimate records is the strong irregular variability with an approximately 1500 yr period, known as the Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events, which punctuate the last glacial interval but disappear during the Holocene. Many theories, modeling and data suggest that these events, seen as abrupt warming episodes in Greenland ice cores and sea surface temperature records in the North Atlantic, are linked to reorganizations of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). In this study, using a new low-order ocean model, we are able to reproduce a realistic power spectrum of this millennial variability, which emerges in the model as a result of unstable AMOC dynamics rather than due to external freshwater forcing. Within this model we explore differences in the AMOC stability between glacial and interglacial intervals of the 100 kyr glacial cycle of the Late Pleistocene. Previous modeling studies show that the edge of sea ice in the North Atlantic shifts southward during glacial intervals, moving the region of the North Atlantic Deep Water formation and the entire AMOC also southward. Here we demonstrate that, by altering the precipitation structure that the AMOC feels, such an expansion of sea ice cover makes the system unstable, which explains chaotic millennial variability during the glacials and the persistence of stable ocean conditions during the interglacials.",

Each of the following four scenarios is explored and explicitly modeled: correct no-precipitation detection (both satellite and gauges detect no precipitation), missed precipitation (satellite records a zero, but it is incorrect), false alarm (satellite detects precipitation, but the reference is zero), and hit (both satellite and gauges detect precipitation). Previous studies have shown that PUSH was able to reproduce the probability density functions of the benchmark precipitation, to capture missed precipitation and false detection uncertainties, and to reproduce the spatial pattern of the error over the Oklahoma region. This study shows how this framework can be generalized to other regions of the world, based on information that is available anywhere anytime. This will be exceptionally crucial in un-gauged regions of the world, where satellite retrievals represent the only available precipitation estimate on which hydrological applications (e.g., flood forecasting) and water resources management can rely.

            "abstract": "Within the cold interior of western and northern Canada, rapid and widespread environmental changes are taking place, which are of serious concern for society and have a range of implications from local to regional and global scales. From a scientific standpoint there is an urgent need to understand the changes and develop improved diagnostic and predictive modelling tools to deal with the uncertainty faced in the future. The Changing Cold Regions Network (CCRN) is a research consortium of over 50 Canadian university and government scientists and international researchers aimed at addressing these issues within the geographic domain of the Mackenzie and Saskatchewan River Basins. CCRN’s primary focus is to integrate existing and new experimental data with modelling and remote sensing products to understand, diagnose and predict changing land, water and climate, and their interactions and feedbacks. To support these activities, the network utilizes a suite of 14 world-class water, ecosystem, cryosphere and climate (WECC) observatories across this region that provide exceptional opportunities to observe change, investigate processes and their dynamics, and develop and test environmental models. This talk will briefly describe the CCRN thematic components and WECC observatories, and will then describe some of the observed environmental changes and their linkages across the northern and mountainous parts of the network study domain. In particular, this will include changes in permafrost, terrestrial vegetation, snowcover, glaciers, and river discharge in relation to observed climatic changes across the region. The observations draw on a wide range of literature sources and statistical analyses of federal and provincial regional monitoring network data, while more detailed observations at some of the WECC observatories help to show how these regional changes are manifested at local scales and vice versa. A coordinated special observation and analysis period across all WECC observatories is planned for 2014–15, and this will also be briefly described.",

One of the objectives of this project is the creation of a network of Nippon Foundation / GEBCO Scholars working together, derived from the thirty Scholars from fourteen nations bordering on the Indian Ocean who have graduated from this Postgraduate Certificate in Ocean Bathymetry (PCOB) training program training program at the University of New Hampshire. The IOBC project has provided students a working example during their course work and has been used as basis for student projects during their visits to another Laboratory at the end of their academic year. This multi-national, multi-disciplinary project team will continue to build on the skills gained during the PCOB program through additional training. The IOBC is being built using the methodology developed for the International Bathymetric Chart of the Southern Ocean (IBCSO) compilation (Arndt et al., 2013). This skill was transferred, through training workshops, to further support the ongoing development within the scholar’s network. This capacity-building project is envisioned to connect other personnel from within all of the participating nations and organizations, resulting in additional capacity-building in this field of multi-resolution bathymetric grid generation in their home communities.\nAn updated regional bathymetric map and grids of the Indian Ocean will be an invaluable tool for all fields of marine scientific research and resource management. In addition, it has implications for increased public safety by offering the best and most up-to-date depth data for modeling regional-scale oceanographic processes such as tsunami-wave propagation behavior amongst others.",

            "abstract": "Western Minnesota, USA, is a regional locus of drinking-water wells with high arsenic (As) (As>10µgL-1). Arsenic concentrations vary widely among neighboring wells with otherwise similar water chemistry [1,2]. As(III) should be the most mobile As species in Minnesota well waters (median Eh in As affected wells is -50mV). This As is geogenic, sourced from glacial deposits derived from Cretaceous sedimentary bedrock (dolostone, limestone, shale). Our hypothesis is that As speciation in the solid phase is the important factor controlling the introduction of As to groundwater—more significant in this region than absolute As concentrations or landscape variability.\nOur previous research used micro-X-ray absorption spectroscopy (µXAS) speciation mapping [3] on archived glacial tills (stored dry at room temperature in air). µXAS results from this material showed that As in a reduced chemical state within the till aquitard is spatially correlated with iron sulfide at the micron scale. Conversley, As in aquifer sediments was mainly oxidized As(V). At the aquifer-aquitard contact As was observed as a mixture of both reduced and oxidized forms. This suggests that the aquifer-aquitard contact is a geochemically active zone in which reduced As species present within glacial till are converted to As(V) through complex redox processes, and subsequently release into aquifer sediments.\n Our current research applies the same methods to describe As speciation in samples collected from fresh cores of glacial sediment and frozen under argon in the field. Preliminary results are similar to our previous work in that As is, in general, more reduced in aquitard sediments, and more oxidized at the contact and in aquifer sediments. Arsenic(III) was preserved as a minor consitutent in ambient archived cores but is a more significant constituent in fresh, anaerobically preserved cores. Results will be presented comparing anaerobic samples with ambient-air aliquots of the same sample to document changes in the relative abundance of As species depending on sample preservation.\nThis work was supported by LBNL-ALS, ANL-APS, USGS-MNWSC, MGS, and CURA.

These experiments, baseline0, are performed in a low-resolution configuration (MPI-ESM-LR) with the latest version of the ocean model MPIOM and the atmospheric component ECHAM6, in a resolution GR15L40 and T063L47 respectively. The MPI-ESM-LR hindcasts are downscaled to the CORDEX-Europe domain with a horizontal grid resolution of 0.22° using the mesoscale non-hydrostatic regional climate model COSMO-CLM (CCLM) (Rockel et al. 2008) with the version of COSMO4.8-clm17 for the time period 1961-2010 realizing hindcasts from 1961 to 2001 each 10 years for one decade. The evaluation run (ERA40 extended by ERA-Interim and downscaled by CCLM) are used to initialize temperature and humidity in/at the soil/surface in the hindcasts. By using driving data with 1-day-lagged initialization, the “initial conditions” perturbation strategy is implemented.\nThe gridded observational E-OBS data in version 8.0 (Haylock et al., 2008) and the CCLM evaluation run are used for evaluation. The focus of this study is on the 2-m temperature over Europe. To filter out the systematic error, anomalies are calculated by considering the time period 1981-2010 as reference period. Before the evaluation of reliability, the forecast quality is assessed by the anomaly correlation (Fig. 1) and the root mean square error (Fig. 2) (Wilks, 2006). The low-pass filtered 2-m temperature anomaly averaged over Europe from reference datasets and the ensemble mean reveals that the CCLM captures the climate change signal.\nAn ensemble prediction system is perfectly reliable when the mean ensemble spread equals the mean RMSE of the ensemble-mean forecast (Palmer, 2006 and Doblas-Reyes, 2013). Therefore the ratio of the ensemble spread to ensemble error defined as ensemble spread score (ESS) (Keller, 2011), is assessed for reliability. The evaluation shows that there is added value for reliability in downscaling nearly everywhere in different seasons (Fig. 3). The spread-error diagrams are provided to assess the behavior of reliability by changing spread. It shows the added value in downscaling in the most cases. By considering annual value, although the reliability decreases in large spreads but the added value of downscaling is significant (Fig. 4).",

            "abstract": "Mount Erebus lava lake eruptions exhibit many characteristic strombolian attributes including the ascent of a large gas slug(s) through the magma column followed by its expansion and bursting at the surface. Strombolian explosions correspond to pressurized large (>10 m radius) bubbles, which distend the lava lake surface before bursting within a few tenths of a second thus generating infrasonic impulses followed by decaying oscillations. We quantify the dynamics of bubble evolution using infrasound and time synchronized video data recording at ~30 FPS. Video footage is used to synthesize pressure time series during eruptions assuming a simple acoustic source. These synthetic pressure records are directly compared to infrasound pressure records collected at two sites located ~300 m from the lava lake source. A scaled relationship exists between infrasound and video derived pressures where video generally overestimates the volumetrically expanding source. This scaling is due to the image processing routine, which tracks and models the ejection of ballistics during eruption as an expanding hemisphere and not necessarily the expansion of a translucent gas source that is not directly visible with optical imagery. Using both data sets, we describe Erebus lava lake eruptions in three phases with smooth distension of spherical cap (P1), followed by membrane fragmentation and violent gas expulsion (P2) and finally a contraction of the volumetric gas source due to an initial over-expansion followed by re-equilibration. (P3). Specifically, P3 is identified by decaying oscillations of the pressure record which has been well modeled in laboratory experiments but never described at Erebus.",

            "abstract": "Boreal forests are a major source of surface albedo feedback spread in CMIP5 models. We’ve incorporated improvements into the Community Land Model (CLM) vegetation canopy snow treatment in order to more realistically represent boreal forest canopy albedo. Current CLM hydrology does not differentiate the phase of precipitation intercepted by vegetation. To represent canopy snow, there is a sharp temperature-dependent switch in canopy albedo parameters at 0 K. Snow immediately ceases to exist when vegetation temperature rises above freezing. We’ve separated phases in the CLM vegetation hydrology, allowing snow to have its own storage maximum and interception treatment. Wind and melt based unloading terms have also been incorporated to more accurately simulate canopy processes, creating a path for canopy snow loss in freezing temperatures. To evaluate the new treatment, we compared singe-point CLM 4.5 simulations with accumulated canopy snow mass measurements from Umpqua Forest, Oregon. Additionally, we have considered the effects of modifying snow cover fraction and latent heat fluxes from phase changes. Global CLM simulations evaluate the climatic differences between existing CLM and CLM with the new implementations for boreal forests.",

            "abstract": "The Velocity Azimuth Display (VAD) and the dual-Doppler analyses techniques established for ground-based scanning radar are applied to the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center High-Altitude Imaging Wind and Rain Airborne Profiler (HIWRAP). A modified formula of VAD analysis for the HIWRAP is presented to examine the error due to aircraft motion. We found that this error is small in general. For typical values of HIWRAP’ antenna’s scan rate and aircraft ground speed, errors in the horizontal wind fields are less than 0.5 m s-1. We assume a constant hydrometeor vertical velocity on the HIWRAP scan circle in the analysis. This assumption introduces unbiased error with the mean of ~ 0.04 - 0.16 m s-1 and standard deviation of ~3.42 - 4.04 m s-1 in the VAD-derived horizontal winds, respectively. We have applied the VAD analysis to the HIWRAP’s first field experiment data collected during NASA’s Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes (GRIP) mission. The results show that the along track wind from VAD technique and dual-Doppler analysis agree in general. The VAD horizontal winds derived from HIWRAP capture Hurricane Karl’s vortex structure, and they are in general agreement with horizontal winds from nearby dropsondes except for regions about 6 km altitude and above where the data has low signal-to-noise ratio and contaminated by velocity folding. VAD winds represent a mean over an area within the radar scan region and therefore smooth out many of the transient or small-scale features so that only the larger scale feature of the winds remain, and therefore it can provide valuable information for data assimilation studies.",

            "abstract": "Sedimentary facies-based climate proxy data from the thick, coal-bearing, fluvial-lacustrine Haojiagou and Badaowan fms. of the high-paleolatitude (55-65° N) Junggar Basin of northwestern China show that Late Triassic and Early Jurassic (~210-190 Ma) high latitude climate variability was strongly paced by obliquity cycle-dominated (~40-50 ky) orbital variations (1), based on an age model using the 405 ky cycle of eccentricity and the end-Triassic extinction tie point (2,3). In contrast, contemporaneous low-latitude continental climate was nearly exclusively paced by climatic precession, with virtually no hint of obliquity (4). While obliquity-dominance at high latitude is not necessarily unexpected, the envelope of variability of eccentricity, as well as its period (for cycles > 405 ky) at both high and low latitudes deviate in major ways from the expectations of current numerical solutions of orbital variations (5), but is consistent with chaotic diffusion of the Solar System (6), while our preliminary data also suggest that the Earth-Mars orbital secular resonance was in today’s 2-to-1 ratio of eccentricity to inclination periods (5). Previously unknown, this obliquity-dominated, non-analog climate variation in the apparently warm and glacier-free high-latitudes of Pangea, coupled with documented low-latitude climatic precession-dominated climate variation, provides a glimpse of an empirical basis for mapping the behavior of the Solar System during times when its behavior was significantly different than present day.

            "abstract": "The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method had been proved to be successful in snow water equivalent retrieval based on synthetic point-scale passive microwave brightness temperature (TB) observations. This method needs only general prior information about distribution of snow parameters, and could estimate layered snow properties, including the thickness, temperature, density and snow grain size (or exponential correlation length) of each layer. In this study, the multi-layer HUT (Helsinki University of Technology) model and the MEMLS (Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks) will be used as observation models to assimilate the observed TB into snow parameter prediction. Previous studies had shown that the multi-layer HUT model tends to underestimate TB at 37 GHz for deep snow, while the MEMLS does not show sensitivity of model bias to snow depth. Therefore, results using HUT model and MEMLS will be compared to see how the observation model will influence the retrieval of snow parameters. The radiometric measurements at 10.65, 18.7, 36.5 and 90 GHz at Sodankyla, Finland will be used as MCMC input, and the statistics of all snow property measurement will be used to calculate the prior information. 43 dry snowpits with complete measurements of all snow parameters will be used for validation. The entire dataset are from NorSREx (Nordic Snow Radar Experiment) experiments carried out by Juha Lemmetyinen, Anna Kontu and Jouni Pulliainen in FMI in 2009-2011 winters, and continued two more winters from 2011 to Spring of 2013. Besides the snow thickness and snow density that are directly related to snow water equivalent, other parameters will be compared with observations, too. For thin snow, the previous studies showed that influence of underlying soil is considerable, especially when the soil is half frozen with part of unfrozen liquid water and part of ice. Therefore, this study will also try to employ a simple frozen soil permittivity model to improve the performance of retrieval. The behavior of the Markov chain in soil parameters will be studied.",

Satellite magnetic data demonstrates that planetary dynamos can produce a range of magnetic field morphologies and intensities. Numerical dynamo simulations are working towards determining relationships between planetary properties and the resulting magnetic field characteristics. However, with only a handful of planetary dynamos in our solar system, it is challenging to determine specific dependence of magnetic field properties on planetary characteristics.\nExtrasolar planets therefore provide a unique opportunity by significantly increasing the number of planets for study as well as offering a much larger range of planetary properties to investigate. Although detection of exoplanet magnetic fields is challenging at present, the increasing sophistication of observational tools available to astronomers implies these extrasolar planetary magnetic fields may eventually be detectable. This presentation will discuss potential observational trends for magnetic field strength and morphology for exoplanets based on numerical simulations and interior structure modeling. We will focus on the influence of planetary age, environment, composition and structure.",

            "abstract": "This study investigates the effect of micrite on the acoustic properties of well-controlled microstructures created in the laboratory to closely mimic carbonate rocks. In particular, we examine the effect of micrite content on the elastic stiffness rock, its sensitivity to pressure, and induced dissolution upon saturation with a reactive fluid. We followed Dunham’s classification and fabricated the samples by mixing coarse (sand size) and very fine (micrite size) calcite grains in different ratios, with the addition of cement and then cold-compressing the mixture. The acoustic velocities were measured under bench-top conditions and as functions of confining pressure before and after the injection of a CO2aqueous solution.\nOur bench-top measurements indicated that micrite makes the frame of the carbonate samples stiffer. Since the sensitivity of the elastic stiffness to pressure decreases as the content of micrite increases (see figure 1), we hypothesize a stiffer pore structure (i.e., rounder pores) in micrite-richer fabrics. Furthermore, the presence of micrite makes the carbonate sample more reactive upon dissolution. The concentration of Ca+2 cations in the fluid measured at the outlet after the injection of the CO2 aqueous solution shows larger dissolution in the micrite-rich samples likely due to the higher surface area of the micrite aggregates. The content of micrite also seems to affect the evolution of stiffness as dissolution proceeds. As the content of micrite increases, the enhanced dissolution translates into a marked softening of the rock frame. We conclude that the content of micrite can play an important role in the complex rock-fluid interaction of carbonates as well as when comparing Gassmann’s predictions to velocity measurements of saturated carbonates.",

            "abstract": "Systematic lithium isotope variations along concentration gradients found in olivine and pyroxene grains from terrestrial, lunar and martian rocks have been attributed to diffusive isotopic fractionation [Beck et al., 2006; Tang et al., 2007]. In some cases, these isotopic excursions are so large that a single grain may display isotopic variability that spans almost the entire range of documented terrestrial values [Jeffcoate et al., 2007]. In this study, we present the results of experiments to examine diffusive isotopic fractionation of lithium in olivine. The experiments comprised crystallographically oriented slabs of San Carlos olivine juxtaposed with either spodumene powder or a lithium rich pyroxene crystal. Experiments were conducted at 1 GPa and 0.1MPa over a temperature range of 1000 to 1125⁰C. Oxygen fugacity in the 0.1MPa experiments was controlled using the wustite-magnetite and nickel-nickel oxide solid buffer assemblages. Lithium concentrations generally decrease smoothly away from the edges of the grains; however, experiments involving diffusion parallel to the a-axis consistently show peculiar wavy or segmented concentration profiles. Lithium diffusivity parallel to the c-axis is on the order of 1E-14m2/s at 1100⁰C. The diffusivity parallel to the c-axis is more than an order of magnitude faster than diffusion parallel to the b-axis and correlates positively with oxygen fugacity. The lithium isotopic composition, δ7Li = 1000‰ * ((δ7Lisample- δ7Ligrain center)/ δ7Ligrain center), shows a decrease away from the edge of the grain to a minimum value (up to 70‰ lighter) and then an abrupt increase back to the initial isotopic composition of the olivine grain. This isotopic profile is similar to those found in natural grains and an experimental study on diffusive fractionation of lithium isotopes in pyroxene [Richter et al., 2014]. Results from the present study are modeled using the approach of Dohmen et al. [2010], which assumes lithium diffusion occurs on both a metal and interstitial site and that lithium is able to jump between these two sites. The best fits to the results show that diffusive isotopic fractionation may occur on both the interstitial and metal site but the degree of diffusive isotopic fractionation is always greater on the interstitial site.",

            "abstract": "Even when a data center makes it's datasets accessible, they can still be hard to discover if the user is unaware of the laboratory or organization the data center supports. NCAR’s Earth Observing Laboratory (EOL) is no exception. In response to this problem and as an inquiry into the feasibility of inter-connecting all of NCAR's repositories at a discovery layer, ESRI’s Geoportal was researched. It was determined that an implementation of Geoportal would be a good choice to build a proof of concept model of inter-repository discovery around. This collaborative project between the University of Illinois and NCAR is coordinated through the Data Curation Education in Research Centers program. This program is funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services.<p\">Geoportal is open source software. It serves as an aggregation point for metadata catalogs of earth science datasets, with a focus on geospatial information. EOL’s metadata is in static THREDDS catalogs. Geoportal can only create records from a THREDDS Data Server. The first step was to make EOL metadata more accessible by utilizing the ISO 19115-2 standard. It was also decided to create DIF records so EOL datasets could be ingested in NASA’s Global Change Master Directory (GCMD). <p\">To offer records for harvest, it was decided to develop an OAI-PMH server. To make a compliant server, the OAI_DC standard was also implemented. A server was written in Perl to serve a set of static records. We created a sample set of records in ISO 19115-2, FGDC, DIF, and OAI_DC. We utilized GCMD shared vocabularies to enhance discoverability and precision. The proof of concept was tested and verified by having another NCAR laboratory’s Geoportal harvest our sample set. <p\">To prepare for production, templates for each standard were developed and mapped to the database. These templates will help the automated creation of records. Once the OAI-PMH server is re-written in a Grails framework a dynamic representation of EOL’s metadata will be available for harvest. <p\">EOL will need to develop an implementation of a Geoportal and point GCMD to the OAI-PMH server. We will also seek out partnerships with other earth science and related discipline repositories that can communicate by OAI-PMH or Geoportal so that the scientific community will benefit from more discoverable data.\n<p\">",

            "abstract": "Oxygen isotopes are essential to quantify mantle-derived versus ‘recycled’ crustal contributions to arc magmas. High δ18O values in igneous rocks (i.e., δ18OSMOW > ~5.7) are generally used to identify supra-crustal inputs, but a melt can also become enriched in 18O due to magmatic differentiation [1,2]. To assess magmatic δ18O values of plutonic rocks, δ18Ozircon values, which are resilient to secondary alteration, are often used. Thus, to disentangle the effects of assimilation versus fractionation, both the absolute increase in melt δ18O due to differentiation and ∆18O(WR-zircon) must be determined. However, existing constraints on the effect of magmatic fractionation on melt δ18O are model-based [2] and calculated relationships between WR SiO2, δ18Ozircon, and δ18Omelt do not incorporate complex melt SiO2, H2O, and temperature (T) relationships [3]. To build upon these initial constraints, we combine the first high-precision δ18O data set on natural samples documenting changes in δ18O melt values with increasing extent of differentiation and modeling which incorporates experimentally constrained melt SiO2, H2O, and T relationships. We analyzed 55 mineral separates with infrared laser-fluorination [4] across large fractionation intervals of two well-studied cumulate sequences: (I) a relatively dry (~1 wt.% H2O initial) tholeiitic sequence (analyzed minerals include plag, opx, cpx, & Fe-rich ol) from the Bushveld Complex and (II) a hydrous high-K sequence (analyzed minerals include ol, cpx, bt, fsp, & qtz) from the Dariv paleoarc in Mongolia. Our results indicate that multiple per mil increases in melt δ18O can occur during magmatic fractionation that in detail depend strongly on melt composition and T. Calculated relationships between WR SiO2 and δ18Ozircon for experimental melt compositions show that wet, ‘cool’ and dry, ‘hot’ melts are characterized by larger and smaller ∆18O (melt-zircon) fractionations, respectively. Applying our results to the O isotope record of the Sierra Nevadas [3], we show that some trends in δ18Ozircon from individual intrusive suites can be explained by fractional crystallization alone and do not require temporal variations in crustal contamination.\n[1] Eiler 2001 [2] Bindeman et al. 2004 [3] Lackey et al. 2008 [4] Wang et al. 2011",

            "abstract": "The rate of sea level rise has increased over the last decades in part due to enhanced ice sheet melting. The purpose of my project is to study the processes that control the growth and decay of ice sheets surrounding the Bering Sea. Two major orbital cycles affect ice sheet size: precession has periodicity of ~20 thousand years (kyr) and results in changes in the Earth-sun distance during each season, and obliquity has a period of 41 kyr and results in a shift in the Earth’s axial tilt by 2.5 degrees. The Milankovitch theory states that glacial-interglacial cycles were caused by changes in summertime solar radiation, which varies at both precession and obliquity periodicities of 20 and 41 kyr. However, in some geologic periods, benthic foramininfera oxygen isotope records reveal only 41 kyr variability in global ice volume. Two theories, each with different implications regarding how ice sheets respond to solar heating, have been proposed to explain this discrepancy; Raymo et al. (2006) predict that individual ice sheets vary at both 20 and 41 kyr periodicities even if the sum total of global ice volume varies only at 41 kyr, while Huybers (2008) predicts that individual ice sheets vary only at the 41 kyr periodicity. To test these theories, we created a proxy record, from ~1.3 to 1.7 myrs ago, of local ice sheet dynamics using estimates of mass accumulation and flux of Ice Rafted Debris (IRD) from IODP Site U1340A in the Bering Sea. IRD, defined as terrigenous grains greater than 250µm, is transported by icebergs, and is used as a proxy to analyze changes in ice sheet size. We find evidence for ~20 kyr variability, suggesting that local ice sheets are sensitive to the peak intensity of summertime solar forcing. This work is a step in determining how ice sheets respond to changes in seasonal and annual average heating.",

Analysis of these combined satellite datasets reveals that the effects of eddy-induced surface currents on the surface stress usually dominate the effects of air-sea interaction from the influence of eddy-induced SST anomalies on the surface wind field (see figure). The former arises from the surface current effect on the relative wind that determines the surface stress. The latter arises from the effects of SST on vertical mixing in the atmospheric boundary layer. Although this SST influence is generally weaker than the surface current effect, it is not negligible.\nWhile the effects of mesoscale eddies on Ekman pumping are clearly documented from the satellite data, it is not yet known how the feedback of this Ekman pumping on the ocean affect the kinematic properties and evolution of oceanic mesoscale eddies. This is being investigated from empirically coupled numerical model simulations in which the SST and surface current effects on eddy-induced Ekman pumping are imposed individually and together, and the resulting ocean circulation is compared with a Control run in which the eddy-induced Ekman pumping is turned off. Preliminary results have found that both SST and surface currents attenuate the mesoscale eddy field. Consistent with the analysis of QuikSCAT and other satellite data, surface current effects attenuate the eddy field more than SST effects. The SST effects are not negligible, however. They alter the eddy fields in the numerical simulations in more subtle but significant ways. The effects of eddy-induced Ekman pumping on the large-scale circulation will also be investigated from the various numerical simulations.\nFigure Caption: Maps of Ekman pumping velocities wE from SST and surface current effects (top and bottom rows, respectively) for an idealized but realistic anticyclonic (counterclockwise-rotating) eddy at 40°S in the Southern Hemisphere.",

            "abstract": "High-latitude Canadian peatlands store a significant stock of soil carbon that has the potential to become mobilized to the atmosphere if climate warming leads to changes in the net balance of plant productivity and decomposition. We completed a detailed study of C accumulation rates from the sediment record in coastal eastern Canada to help to determine the relative impacts of regional climate vs. local processes, such as hydrology and fire disturbance, on rates of C storage. Seven cores from subarctic peatlands in Labrador were analyzed to determine the influence of fires on carbon storage over the past 8,000 years, specifically over known warm periods. Calibrated radiocarbon dates, bulk density, and percent carbon were used to calculate carbon accumulation rates. Areal charcoal concentration was used as a proxy for fire severity. Carbon accumulation rates appear to be most strongly controlled by changing regional climatic regimes. From 8,000 cal yr BP to the present, rates of accumulation averaged 23.1 ± 6.7 gC m-2 yr-1. C accumulation rates were highest during the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM, 6,000 – 4,000 cal yr BP), averaging 29.6 ± 2.4 g C m-2 yr-1 compared to 22.7 ± 3.7 and 15.9 ± 2.9 g C m-2 yr-1 before and after the HTM, respectively. Samples containing macroscopic charcoal had an average concentration of 0.62 mm2 cm-3 with a maximum concentration found of 3.51 mm2 cm-3. Consistently low charcoal concentrations indicate that fire was neither common nor severe in these wetter peatlands, implying that fires have historically not been a significant control on C accumulation in Labrador, likely due to the high net moisture of the region. Our work supports a growing body of evidence from high latitude peatlands suggesting that future warming conditions, in the absence of shifts in disturbance regimes, could lead to greater soil C sequestration.",

This sediment deposition can reduce water quality in the streams negatively impacting aquatic habitat as well as impacting municipal drinking water sources. These roads are thought to see an increase in construction and use in southeast Ohio due to the expansion of shale gas development in the region. This study set out to quantify the amount of sediment these rural roads are able to produce. A controlled rain event of 12.7 millimeters of rain over a half hour period was used to drive sediment production over a 0.03 kilometer section of gravel rural road. These 8 segments varied in many characteristics and produced from 2.0 to 8.4 kilograms of sediment per 0.03 kilometers of road with the average production over the 8 segments being 5.5 kilograms of sediment. Sediment production was not strongly correlated with road segment slope but traffic was found to increase sediment production from 1.1 to 3.9 times as much sediment after traffic use. These results will help inform watershed scale sediment budgeting, and inform best management practices for road maintenance and construction. This study also adds to the understanding of the impacts of rural road use and construction associated with the changing land use from agricultural to natural gas extraction.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have focused on documenting fluctuations of the Greenland Ice Sheet margin throughout the Holocene but few data exist that constrain past changes of local glaciers independent of the ice sheet. Our research combines proglacial lake sediment analysis with cosmogenic 10Be dating of Holocene moraines and radiocarbon dating of ice-cap-killed vegetation with an overall objective to use this multi-proxy approach to generate a detailed record of the coupled climate-glacier system through the Holocene. Here, we present lacustrine records of mountain glacier variability from continuous pro-glacial lake sediment sequences recovered from two glaciated catchments in northeastern Nuussuaq, western Greenland. We use radiocarbon-dated sediments from Sikuiui and Pauiaivik lakes to reconstruct the timing of advance and retreat of local glaciers. Sediments were characterized with magnetic susceptibility (MS), gamma density, Itrax XRF and visible reflectance spectroscopy at 0.2 cm intervals and sediment organic matter at 0.5 cm intervals. Basal radiocarbon ages provide minimum-age constraints on deglaciation from Sikuiui and Pauiaivik lakes of ~9.6 and 8.7 ka, respectively. Organic-rich gyttja from deglaciation until ~5.0 ka in Pauiaivik Lake suggests minimal glacial extent there while slightly elevated MS values from ~9.0 – 7.0 ka in Sikuiui Lake may reflect early Holocene glacial advances. Minerogenic sediment input gradually increases starting at ~5.0 ka in Pauiaivik Lake, which we interpret as the onset of Neoglaciation in the catchment. Furthermore, a distinct episode of enhanced glacial activity from ~4.0 – 2.2 ka in Sikuiui Lake may be correlative to a period of persistent snowline lowering evidenced by radiocarbon dates of ice-killed vegetation from nearby ice cap margins. Results from these lacustrine records and our ice-killed vegetation dataset suggest a middle Holocene onset of Neoglaciation ~5.0 – 4.0 ka in this region. We are supplementing these records with cosmogenic 10Be exposure dating to further constrain the timing of deglaciation. In addition, these sedimentary archives will continue to be compared to radiocarbon dates of ice-killed vegetation along adjacent ice cap margins to determine if times of persistent snowline lowering are correlative to periods of glacier advance.",

            "abstract": "Are low-relief high-elevation surfaces generally a result of uplift of flat surfaces formed close to sea-level or can they be formed \"in situ\" by climate dependent surface processes such as those associated with glaciation? This question is important to resolve in order to understand the geological history in many regions of the world.\nThe glacial buzzsaw concept suggests that intense glacial erosion focused at the equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) leads to a concentration in surface area close to the ELA. However, even in predominantly glacial landscapes, such as the Scandinavian Mountains, the high surfaces often have nonglacial characteristics and show pre-glacial inheritance of cosmogenic nuclide concentrations. This suggests that subglacial erosion is not the dominant erosion mechanism.\nAnderson (2002) showed that periglacial frost-driven processes working over timescales of millions of years form low-curvature parabolic surfaces at accordant elevation across intervening valleys. The rate of these erosion processes is limited by the slow diffusive transport of regolith in the periglacial domain.\nWe elaborate on this idea by quantifying frost cracking and frost creep in a numerical model as a function of mean annual air temperature and sediment thickness. This allows us to incorporate periglacial processes into a long-term landscape evolution model where surface elevation, sediment thickness, and climate evolve over time. With this model we are able to explore the slow feedbacks between periglacial erosion, sediment transport, and the evolving topography. We show that smooth peaks, convex hillslopes, and a few meters thick regolith cover at high elevation are emergent properties of the landscape evolution model. By varying climate and other model parameters, we discuss how the landscape evolution model can be used for obtaining more insight into the conditions needed for formation of low-relief surfaces at high elevation.\nAnderson, R.

            "abstract": "Increasingly large numbers of supraglacial lakes form and drain every summer on the Greenland Ice Sheet. Presently, about 15% of the lakes drain rapidly within the timescale of a few hours, and the vertical discharge of water during these events may find a pre-existing subglacial hydrological network, particularly late in the melt season. Here, we present a model for subglacial flooding applied specifically to such circumstances. Given the short timescale of events, we treat ice and bed as purely elastic and assume that the fluid flow in the subglacial conduit is fully turbulent. We evaluate the effect of initial conduit opening, wi, on the rate of flood propagation and along-flow profiles of field variables. We find that floods propagate much faster, particularly in early times, for larger wi. For wi = 10 and 1 cm, for example, floods travel about 68% and 50% farther than in the fully coupled ice/bed scenario after 2 hours of drainage, respectively. Irrespective of the magnitude of wi, we also find that there exists a region of positive pressure gradient. This reversal of pressure gradient draws water in from the farfield and causes the conduit to narrow, respecting mass continuity. While the general shape of the profiles appears similar, greater conduit opening is found for larger wi. For wi = 10 and 1 cm, for example, the elastostatic conduit opening at the point of injection is about 1.39 and 1.26 times that of the fully coupled ice/bed scenario after 2 hours of drainage. The hypothesis of a pre-existing thin film of water is consistent with the spirit of contemporary state-of-the-art continuum models for subglacial hydrology. This also results in avoiding the pressure singularity, which is inherent in classical hydro-fracture models applied to fully coupled ice/bed scenarios, thus opening an avenue for integrating the likes of our model within continuum hydrological models. Furthermore, we foresee that the theory presented can be used to potentially infer subglacial hydrological conditions, particularly wi, given accurate observations of ice surface displacement during drainage events.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic is a complex and poorly studied aerosol environment, impacted by strong anthropogenic contributions during winter months and by regional sources in cleaner summer months. In order to gain a predictive understanding of the changing climate in this region, it is necessary to understand the balance between these two aerosol sources to clarify how aerosol might be altered by or contribute to climate change. We present results of vertically resolved, submicron aerosol composition from an Aerodyne high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) during the NETCARE 2014 Polar6 aircraft campaign. The campaign was based in the high Arctic, at Resolute, NU (74°N), allowing measurements from 60 to 2900 meters over ice, open water and near the ice-edge. Concurrent measurements aboard the Polar6 included ultrafine and accumulation mode particle number and size, cloud condensation nuclei concentrations, trace gas concentrations and single particle composition. Aerosol vertical profiles measured by the AMS can be broadly characterized into two regimes corresponding to different meteorological conditions: the first with very low aerosol loading (<0.1 μg/m3) at low altitudes compared to that aloft and high numbers of nucleation mode particles, and the second with higher concentrations at lower levels. This second regime was associated with low concentrations of nucleation mode particles, and higher observable levels of methane sulphonic acid (MSA) from AMS measurements at low altitudes. MSA, produced during the oxidation of dimethyl sulphide, is a marker for the contribution of ocean-derived biogenic sulphur to particulate sulphur and could be identified and quantified using the high-resolution AMS. MSA to sulphate ratios were observed to increase towards lower altitudes, suggesting a contribution to aerosol loading from the ocean. In addition, we present measurements of aerosol neutralization and the characteristics of organic aerosol that relate to the growth of ultrafine particles to accumulation mode sizes.",

Geochemical analyses from core samples demonstrate a sapropel-rich, anoxic interval in strata containing an early Aptian palynomorph assemblage. A negative d13C excursion followed by a positive excursion is recorded in the same interval, and is considered an associated effect of the Anoxic Event. New age constraints on the Lower Cretaceous strata on Svalbard have been produced from basaltic sills and dykes in Cretaceous and older rocks (U/Pb and Ar/Ar), as well as a bentonite layer within the lower Cretaceous succession. The bentonite age yielded an early Aptian age within a stratigraphic interval containing mid-Barremian palynomorphs, which may imply an incorrectly placed Barremian-Aptian boundary according to the International Commission on Stratigraphy. LIP activity in and around the Barents Sea area was pronounced in the Early Cretaceous, and significant volumes of sediment were subjected to emplacement of volcanic material within the strata, causing large-scale sediment degassing. A causal link between LIP activity and the Oceanic Anoxic Event 1a (OAE1a) is suggested. The data provide an oceanographic and geochemical context for the Lower Cretaceous strata in the Boreal Basin, and provide reference for similar approaches to contemporaneous strata in the neighbouring areas, such as the Sverdrup and Alaska basins.",

            "abstract": "Water resources and agricultural applications require knowledge of crop water use (CWU) over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Due to the spatial density of meteorological stations, the resolution of CWU estimates based on these data is fairly coarse and not particularly suitable or reliable for water resources planning, irrigation scheduling and decision making. Various methods have been developed for quantifying CWU of agricultural crops. In this study, an improved version of the spectral crop coefficient which includes the effects of stomatal closure is applied. Raw digital count (DC) data in the red, near-infrared, and thermal infrared (TIR) spectral bands of Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 imaging sensors are used to construct the TIR–ground cover (GC) pixel data distribution and estimate the effects of stomatal closure. CWU is then estimated by combining results of the spectral crop coefficient approach and the stomatal closer effect. To test this approach, evapotranspiration was measured in 5 agricultural fields in the semi-arid Texas High Plains during the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons and compared to corresponding estimated values of CWU determined using this approach. The results showed that the estimated CWU from this approach was strongly correlated (R2 = 0.79) with observed evapotranspiration. In addition, the results showed that considering the stomatal closer effect in the proposed approach can improve the accuracy of the spectral crop coefficient method. These results suggest that the proposed approach is suitable for operational estimation of evapotranspiration and irrigation scheduling where irrigation is used to replace the daily CWU of a crop.",

            "abstract": "Viscous effects are important for many applications in two-phase flow through porous media. These effects, such as viscous fingering and stable displacement, can be predicted by current dynamic pore network models. However, these models have severe time-step restrictions which limit their usage to small domains. In order to overcome this limitation, we propose a multiscale pore network model for primary drainage. The proposed model is applicable to typical flow scenarios where capillary forces are dominant at the pore scale and viscous forces at larger scales.\nIn our model, the pore network is divided into subnetworks smaller than a characteristic length below which capillary forces dominate (see Figure 1). The algorithm to advance the fluid interfaces within each subnetwork consists of three steps: 1) The saturation rate of each subnetwork is obtained by solving a two-phase meso-scale mass balance equation over the domain of subnetworks. In this step, both the viscous and capillary forces are taken into account. 2) An invasion percolation algorithm is then used to locally advance the fluid-fluid interfaces within each subnetwork until a new saturation value is matched. Here, the viscous forces are neglected. 3) The parameters for the meso-scale mass balance equation are updated based on the updated fluid configurations in each subnetwork.\nAn important feature of our pore network model is that it maintains consistency of both fluid occupancy (see Figure 2) and fluxes at subnetwork interfaces. In addition, it is straightforward to parallelize the solution algorithm. Exemplary results are presented and compared to results obtained with an existing dynamic pore network model.",

            "abstract": "We have developed a novel method for classification and search of climate over the global land surface excluding Antarctica. Our method classifies climate on the basis of the outcome of time series segmentation and clustering. We use WorldClim 30 arc sec. (approx. 1 km) resolution grid data which is based on 50 years of climatic observations. Each cell in a grid is assigned a 12 month series consisting of 50-years monthly averages of mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures as well as the total precipitation.\nThe presented method introduces several innovations with comparison to existing data-driven methods of world climate classifications. First, it uses only climatic rather than bioclimatic data. Second, it employs object-oriented methodology – the grid is first segmented before climatic segments are classified. Third, and most importantly, the similarity between climates in two given cells is performed using the dynamic time warping (DTW) measure instead of the Euclidean distance.\nThe DTW is known to be superior to Euclidean distance for time series, but has not been utilized before in classification of global climate. To account for computational expense of DTW we use highly efficient GeoPAT software (http://sil.uc.edu/gitlist/) that, in the first step, segments the grid into local regions of uniform climate. In the second step, the segments are classified.\nWe also introduce a climate search – a GeoWeb-based method for interactive presentation of global climate information in the form of query-and-retrieval. A user selects a geographical location and the system returns a global map indicating level of similarity between local climates and a climate in the selected location. The results of the search for location: \"University of Cincinnati, Main Campus\" are presented on attached map. The results of the search for location: \"University of Cincinnati, Main Campus\" are presented on the map.\nWe have compared the results of our method to Koeppen classification scheme as well as to existing data-driven climate classification methods and concluded that our DWT-based method provides the new, superior analytical framework for studying climate variability on global scale.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the fate of carbon in subduction zones is critical to understand carbon cycle on a global scale. The amount of carbonate and reduced (organic) carbon that is subducted and the amount of CO2 that is released from arc volcanoes vary for subduction zones around the globe. If the agent of carbon transfer from slab to sub-arc mantle is a partial melt of either ocean-floor sediments [1] or hydrous basalt [2], we need to know the solubility of CO2 in rhyolitic slab melt to constrain the flux of carbon in subduction zones.\nOur previous experiments have constrained CO2 content in silicic slab melts as a function of P (1.5-3.0 GPa) and melt H2O content (0.5-3.0 wt.%) [3]. Here we extend our experiments to constrain the effect of temperature (1100-1400 °C) and fO2 (CO2 vapor-saturated [3] and graphite-saturated) on CO2 solubility and speciation in natural rhyolitic melts. From our data, we constructed empirical and thermodynamic models to calculate CO2 content in slab melts at P and T appropriate for the sub-arc region of the subducting slab at variable fO2 [4]. These experiments and models show that CO2 solubility increases with increasing P, fO2, and melt H2O contents to ~3.5 wt.%, while there is a only slight increase in CO2 solubility with increasing T though the effect is much smaller.\nOur study constrains the extent of C-cycling to the deep interior and to the arc source for graphite-saturated domains of the downgoing crust. Further, there is a general correspondence between CO2 solubility in slab-derived, rhyolitic melts at sub-arc depth with measured CO2 outflux at arcs [5]. For hotter slabs (T>800 °C) the calculated CO2 contents using our thermodynamic model, for example, are 1.5-3.4 wt.% for a low-H2O melt generated near the FMQ buffer and correspond to arc fluxes of 50-500 × 109 mol/yr. For colder slabs (T<800 °C) the calculated CO2 contents are 0.9-1.6 wt.% for a low-H2O melt generated near the FMQ buffer and correspond to arc fluxes of 0.1-15 ×1 09 mol/yr. This correspondence suggests that slab-derived silicic melt may be the chief agent of C-transport from slab to mantle wedge.\n[1] Plank and Langmuir (1993) Nature, 362, 739-743; [2] Prouteau et al.

At present, this region is characterised by upwelling of eastern South Atlantic central water from 150-500 m depth. Stable isotopes (δ18O and δ13C) and Mg/Ca were measured on the planktonic foraminifer Globigerina bulloides, which may be assumed to thrive in upwelled waters. Stable isotopes were also measured on the benthic foraminifer Cibicides wuellerstorfi. Core MD08-3167 records were dated based on 23 14C dates covering the last 30 ky.\nWater δ18O was computed from G. bulloides δ18O and Mg/Ca measurements. A sharp decrease in G. bulloides δ18O paralleled by a sharp increase in G. bulloides Mg/Ca temperature from ~10 to 14 °C takes place over 1000 y between ~18.5 and 17.5 calendar ky BP (ka). After a wide maximum at ~14°C centred about 15 ka, G. bulloides Mg/Ca temperature decreases to 13°C at 13 ka, in phase with the Antarctic cold reversal, then increases to reach an Early Holocene optimum at 16 °C at 9 ka, before decreasing to reach ~15°C, i.e. modern temperatures at 50 m depth. Upwelled water δ18O (δ18Ow) decreases by 1.8‰ from the last glacial maximum (LGM) to the Late Holocene. The evolution of δ18Ow is marked by a sharp 0.9‰ decrease in parallel with the 4°C warming recorded by G. bulloides Mg/Ca, then essentially follows the decrease in global mean ocean δ18O inferred from sea level rise. Our records thus indicate that upwelled waters were both ~4°C colder and 0.9‰ enriched during the LGM relative to the modern ocean after correction for sea level rise. LGM low SSTs can thus not be attributed to enhanced advection of subpolar waters into the Benguela current. In contrast, our records suggest enhanced upwelling of colder water along the continental margin during the LGM that could originate from a mixture of re-circulated South Atlantic central water, glacial North Atlantic intermediate water, and circumpolar deep water.\nWe further compare core MD08-3167 records with benthic isotopic and surface records from other well-dated South Atlantic cores of comparable temporal resolution, i.e. western tropical Atlantic core GeoB3910, and Sub-Antarctic cores MD07-3076Q and TNO57-21 (Barker and Diz, 2014).",

            "abstract": "Discussion continues on the relative role of authigenic (pigment) fine-grained hematite, relative to detrital, considerably coarser specular hematite (specularite) as a carrier of geologically meaningful remanence, as a determinant of rock magnetic properties, and as a contributor to magnetic fabrics in red beds. For one, many workers commonly assume that the laboratory unblocking temperature spectra (Tlub) of a red bed dominated by authigenic pigment does not reach the maximum Tlub as approximated by the Neel temperature (~948 K) because of the ultra fine grain size of the pigment. This issue was discussed as recently as the IRM Santa Fe meeting in late June, 2014. Many laboratories routinely utilize chemical demagnetization in concert with progressive thermal demagnetization to attempt to assess the relative role of pigment vs. detrital hematite. However, the utility of chemical demagnetization has been long challenged. In studying the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility and remanence in red beds, recent work has considered separating the contributions of both types of hematite to the fabric signal. Three different red bed “types” (siltstones of the Triassic Chugwater Group, Gros Ventre Range, Wyoming; mudrocks of lowermost Triassic Quartermaster Formation, west Texas; and siltstones to medium sandstones of Upper Cretaceous age, northwest Vietnam) are used to evaluate the effects of varying contributions by pigment hematite to remanence, rock magnetic, and magnetic fabric properties. All rocks are well-characterized petrographically, so that the modal abundance of detrital oxides is known. The Chugwater siltstones are notable because of a relatively low Tlub spectra (below about 620o C), with no evidence of a low coercivity cubic phase. Rock magnetic and magnetic fabric properties are monitored as a function of progressive chemical demagnetization to further elucidate the role of hematite pigment in rocks that have contributed much to the paleomagnetic record of Earth.",

            "abstract": "Store Glacier is a major west Greenland outlet tidewater glacier draining an area of 30,000 square km into Uummannaq Fjord, and flowing at a speed of 4.8 km per year at its terminus. The bed topography of the glacier is poorly known and the fjord bathymetry was partially surveyed for the first time in August 2012. In this study, we present a new approach for the inference of the glacier bed topography, ice thickness and sea floor bathymetry using high-resolution airborne gravity data combined with other data. In August 2012, we acquired a 250 m spacing grid of free-air gravity data at a speed of 50 knots with accuracy at sub-milligal level much higher accuracy than NASA Operation IceBridge (OIB) gravity campaign with approximate 5.2 km resolution at 290 knots flying speed. In August 2012 and 2013, we used multi-beam echo sounding to survey the sea floor bathymetry in front of the glacier, extending to the calving face of the glacier. Inland, we combined radar-derived ice thickness with ice motion vectors to reconstruct the bed topography at a high resolution. Using a 3D inversion of the gravity data, we reconstruct seamless bed topography across the ice front boundary that matches interior data and sea floor bathymetry, and provides information about sediment thickness beneath and in front of the glacier. Comparison of the results with prior maps reveals vast differences. IBCAO3 bathymetry suggests an ice front grounded at sea level while the measured ice front is grounded 550 m below sea level. The seamless topography obtained across the grounding line reveals the presence of a previously unknown sill, which explains why the glacier has been so stable in the last 50 years. The results have important impacts on the interpretation of the glacier stability, and sensitivity to thermal forcing from the ocean and surface melt. This work was conducted at UCI under a contract with the Gordon and Betty More Foundation and with NASA.",

            "abstract": "The Pacific plate (PACI) converges with the Bering plate (BERI) at the Aleutian arc, but the convergence becomes extremely oblique in the western Aleutians. The westernmost segment of the Aleutian arc near the cusp with the Kamchatka-Kuril arc is called the Komandorsky Islands (KOMA), with two islands, Bering and Medny. The strike-slip motion of PACI relative to BERI in the KOMA segment has a speed of ~80 mm/a, but the faulting of strike-slip motion is poorly understood. We analyze GPS velocities at three sites on both islands of KOMA and at two sites on the Pacific coast of Kamchatka. From several years of observations, trench-parallel velocities at all three sites on KOMA are similar: 51, 43, and 50 mm/a relative to BERI. Trench-normal velocities at both sites on Kamchatka are 14 and 21 mm/a relative to the North American plate (NOAM). The question arises: where are the faults that take up the strike-slip motion of PACI relative to BERI? We model elastic lithospheric rotation and strain of KOMA using the DEFNODE software of R. McCaffrey in three scenarios: (1) The active fault is at the Aleutian trench, (2) The active fault is in the backarc north of KOMA, (3) KOMA is a separate lithospheric block, with active faults on both sides. We set the fault locking depth at 20 km because strike-slip earthquakes in the region are not deeper. In Scenario 1, the motion of the Komandorsky Islands is explained by elastic strain at the transform plate boundary to the south. Scenario 1 requires the strike-slip fault to be shallowly dipping (12°) beneath KOMA. For a strike-slip fault nearly vertical in dip, Scenario 1 underpredicts the observed speed of KOMA and Scenario 2 overpredicts the speed. Scenario 3, with KOMA bounded by such faults on the north and on the south, predicts for KOMA a block motion of 58 mm/a, i.e., 120% of the mean observed speed. Velocities of sites on Kamchatka are well explained by elastic strain due to subduction of PACI beneath NOAM.",

            "abstract": "Arctic sea ice reemergence is a phenomenon in which spring sea ice anomalies are positively correlated with fall anomalies, despite a loss of correlation over the intervening summer months. Pan-Arctic sea ice reemergence is present in both observations and global climate models (GCMs), yet the amplitude and regional details of the reemergence signals vary substantially. In this work, a novel data analysis technique, coupled Nonlinear Laplacian Spectral Analysis (NLSA), is employed to study the spatiotemporal co-variability of sea ice concentration, sea surface temperature (SST), and sea level pressure (SLP) in the Arctic. NLSA modes are obtained for observational data and GCM output, and are used to examine the statistical characteristics and physical mechanisms of sea ice reemergence. It is found that lagged correlation features of the raw sea ice data can be efficiently reproduced using low-dimensional families of modes. These families provide an SST-sea ice reemergence mechanism, in which melt season (spring) sea ice anomalies are imprinted as SST anomalies and stored over the summer months, allowing for sea ice anomalies of the same sign to reappear in the growth season (fall). Moreover, the ice anomalies of each family exhibit clear phase relationships between the Barents-Kara, Bering, and Labrador seas. These regional phase relationships have a natural explanation via the SLP patterns and associated geostrophic winds of each family, which closely resemble the Arctic Oscillation and Arctic Dipole Anomaly. Additionally, the winter-to-winter persistence of these SLP patterns suggests another plausible mechanism for sea ice reemergence.",

            "abstract": "The effect of snow accumulation on soil carbon and nutrient cycling is attracting substantial attention from researchers. We know that deeper snow accumulation caused by high stature vegetation increases winter microbial activity and therefore carbon and nitrogen flux rates. However, until now the effect of snow accumulation, by buffering winter soil temperature, on subsequent summer soil processes, has scarcely been considered.\nWe carried out an experiment at an alpine treeline in subarctic Sweden in which soil monoliths, contained within PVC collars, were transplanted between forest (deep winter snow) and tundra heath (shallow winter snow). We measured soil CO2efflux over two growing seasons and quantified soil microbial biomass after the second winter. We showed that respiration rates of transplanted forest soil were significantly reduced compared with control collars (remaining in the forest) as a consequence of colder, but more variable, winter temperatures.\nWe hypothesised that microbial biomass would be reduced in transplanted forests soils but found there was no difference compared to control. We therefore further hypothesised that the similarly sized microbial pool in the control is assembled differently to the transplant. We believe that the warmer winters in forests foster more active consortia of decomposer microbes as a result of different abiotic selection pressures.\nUsing an ecosystem scale experimental approach, we have identified a mechanism that influences summer carbon cycling rates based solely on the amount of snow that accumulates the previous winter. We conclude that modification of snow depth as a consequence of changes in vegetation structure is an important mechanism influencing soil C stocks in ecosystems where snow persists for a major fraction of the year.",

            "abstract": "Increases in global mean temperature lead to increasing sea level mostly by loss of land ice mass and thermal expansion of the ocean. On millennial timescales, a warming of 5 K leads to flooding of about 1.6 % of Earth's current land surface, when taking into account the spatial distribution of relative sea-level rise caused by mass redistribution and isostatic rebound (Marzeion & Levermann, 2014). While there is great seasonal and spatial variability, the planetary albedo over the ocean is generally slightly lower than over land. We use millennial-scale, spatially explicit projections of relative sea-level rise, and the observed spatio-temporal distribution of planetary albedo and incident shortwave radiation, to determine the strength of the feedback between sea-level rise and the planetary energy budget.\nWe find that the feedback is positive, but very weak. While the spatial pattern of sea-level rise is varying strongly with temperature, we find that the strength of the feedback is relatively independent of the temperature change, and around 0.8±0.1 %; i.e., an external forcing of 1 W/m2 will result in 1.008 W/m2 change of the energy balance.",

            "abstract": "Soils are a known carbon sink, holding twice as much carbon as the atmosphere (Schlesinger, 1995). However, little is known about how much soil organic carbon (SOC) is released from the soil during fire events. Surface fires can heat mineral soils to up to 500°C at depths of several centimeters and maintain that temperature for hours (Werts and Jahren, 2007). This has been known to affect the size of particles in soils, carbon content in the soils, and the clay mineralogy (Hungerford et al, 1993). This study looks at relationships between soil clay content and clay chemistry in relation to carbon emissions during surface fires, to determine temperature effects on several piedmont soil types from South Carolina. Soil samples were taken from three different sites varying in clay content, clay type, parent material, and development. Temperature increases were applied in increments of 50°C, with a range from 100°C to 500°C, to determine fire effects on SOC, particle size, and clay mineralogy of the soils. We found a decrease in SOC (up to 98%) from the original amount in all soil horizons with temperature applications up to 500°C. At a temperature range between 100°C and 300°C, most soil horizons showed an increase in clay of a range between 0.1 and 34%. At temperatures ranging from 300°C to 500°C, there was a decrease in clay ranging from 2.5-42%. While previous research suggests that a positive correlation between the percentage of clay and SOC in soils is common (Feller and Beare, 1997), in this study, a negative correlation was found between the percentage of clay and SOC in all three soil types (R2=0.87, 0.76, and 0.59) at 100°C. There appears to be an increasingly positive relationship between clay and carbon as temperature increases, although a consistent high correlation was not present at all temperatures. This is counter to what was found initially in our soils prior to heating. While research into surface fires is important to the understanding of ecosystems and carbon cycling above ground, understanding SOC dynamics following a surface fire event can provide further insight on carbon cycling and erosion impacts of surface fires.",

To what extent T/ET ratios are controlled by vegetation and how to explain the global-scale T/ET variations are not clear. This hinders our predictions of future hydrological changes since vegetation provides a strong feedback to water cycling. We synthesized all the published papers that experimentally quantified at least two of three ET components and measured leaf area index (LAI) simultaneously. Non-linear relationships between T/ET and LAI are identified for both the overall dataset as well as agricultural and natural data subsets. Large variations in T/ET occur across all LAI ranges, with wider variability in T/ET at lower LAI levels. We find that for a given LAI amount, higher T/ET ratios occur latter in the growing season. We developed a function relating T/ET ratios to the growing stage relative to the timing of peak LAI. These two parameters, LAI and growing stage, collectively explained 43% of the variations in the global T/ET dataset, providing a new way to interpret and model the global T/ET variability.",

We did a relocation of all MARS events using Hypo71 and the P-wave velocity model used by the RESAJ. The data comprise more than 2,000 earthquakes with local magnitude between 1.4 and 5.9 and depths between 1.0 and 109 km. Some crustal seismicity alignments are observed on the Jalisco Block. The geometry of the slabs is different; both are clearly separated beneath the Colima Graben. The Cocos plate, residing south of the graben, presents a typical flat slab dipping with an angle of about 21º extending eastward 200 km from the trench. Meanwhile, the more northerly Rivera plate exhibits a curvature or bend, possibly the result of an oblique suduction process, dipping from the trench with an angle of about 10º just south of Bahía Banderas to a dip angle of 25º at the Eastern contact with the Colima Graben. We have produced profiles parallel to the trench, in a profile along the shore line and a second one 50 km inland. A subduction dip angle of 12º towards the SE direction is observed in the Rivera plate in profiles inland from Bahia de Banderas to the Colima Graben, but the seismicity ceases to define the plate for more westerly profiles which enounter the graben.",

Initial efforts to address this have been made, in particular by coupling heat and multiphase flow equations under transient conditions. Implications of honoring the physical representation of such process includes an improved ability to model and analyze effects of projected changes in hydro-climatic variables, as for example the change in thermal regime and the geographic patterns of permafrost degradation. In this contribution the recently developed frozen ground module of PFloTran for fully coupled transient heat and water flow under partially saturated conditions is applied to the subarctic field site of Tarfala in Northern Sweden, where the occurrence of permafrost is sporadic and strongly dependent on snow-depth. Optimizing this model to reproduce subsurface temperature fluctuations in the ground, as recorded in two different boreholes over the last decade, allows to identify the respective roles played by heat diffusion, advection and convection in a changing permafrost environment. The influence of topography is analyzed by applying the model to different domains geometries, where topography is simplified to different degrees. The model has been configured to reproduce temperature observations, providing a estimation of the distribution and thermal regime of permafrost over the entire hill-slope. Based on the configurations that give the most accurate validation against data, changes in permafrost are extrapolated by applying different scenarios of prospective climatic conditions.",

Simultaneous observations of atmospheric ethane, compared with the ethane to methane ratio in pipeline gas, demonstrate that natural gas accounted for 58 – 100 % of methane emissions, depending on season. Using government statistics and geospatial data on energy consumption, we estimate the fractional loss rate to the atmosphere from all downstream components of the natural gas system, including transmission, distribution, and end-use, was 2.9 ± 0.3 % in the Boston urban region, compared to 1.1 % inferred by the Massachusetts greenhouse gas inventory.",

            "abstract": "Since the development of isotope ratio infrared spectroscopy (IRIS), the applications of water isotope analysis have been increasing. Here, we present a new protocol to create high-resolution maps of leaf water isotopes 18O and 2H. We use the Picarro induction module (IM-CRDS) combined with an isotope analyzer (L2130-i) to sample up to 25 locations in one half of each leaf. Each sampling location corresponds to four samples (6 mm outside diameter punched-holes) punched next to each other. In the induction module, an induction coil heats a metal holder containing the leaf sample. The sample will release water vapor that is then sent to the isotope analyzer. The IM-CRDS allows us to significantly reduce the sample size and therefore increase the sample density, compared to the traditional cryogenic extraction method. Using spatial analysis tools, we create high-resolution spatial maps of each isotope as well as d-excess maps. The water in the second half of the leaf is extracted by cryogenic extraction and analyzed using both IRIS and isotope ratio mass spectroscopy. The isotopic composition of the extracted water is compared to the average composition calculated from the maps and used for calibration. We present applications of this protocol to the analysis of the spatio-temporal evolution of foliar uptake in Colocasia esculenta under laboratory conditions.",

            "abstract": "Obtaining estimates of hydraulic properties in the vadose zone is a challenge. Laboratory experiments using core samples from the field are not typically representative of true field conditions, and direct hydrologic field measurements are typically limited in spatial extent. Here, we propose to resolve lithologic variation in the vadose zone though geophysical methods, and specifically by examining temporal changes in electrical conductivity. Because different lithologies have different hydraulic properties, they will exhibit different temporal changes in water content during infiltration and drainage. Simulations of infiltration through various vadose zone models shows, as expected, that water content in clays and silts generally show very little variation over time, whereas water content in sands shows rapid and significant changes over time. Although water content cannot be directly measured in the field, it is highly correlated with electrical conductivity. Therefore, we examine the time derivatives of electrical conductivity data to monitor the rates of change in water content over time. Because geophysical measurements are often noisy, we estimate derivatives using the continuous wavelet transform rather than standard numerical differentiation. By implementing this method on synthetic noisy data, we find that rates of change in water content, and hence electrical conductivity, are consistently close to zero in clays, slightly variable in silts, and highly variable in sands. Application of this method to electrical conductivity probe data from a region of known lithology supports these observations and suggests that examining temporal changes in electrical conductivity can be used to resolve different lithologies in the vadose zone.",

The anticipated launch date is in late 2015. It is being designed to operate for 12 months on orbit to provide global 118-GHz spectral imagery of the Earth over a full seasonal cycle. The mission will focus on the study of Arctic vertical temperature structure and its relation to sea ice coverage, but include the secondary goals of assessing the potential for convective cloud mass detection and cloud top altitude measurement and hurricane warm core sounding. The principles used by PolarCube for sounding and cloud measurement have been well established in number of peer-reviewed papers, although measurements using the 118 GHz oxygen line over the dry polar regions (unaffected by water vapor) have never been demonstrated from space. The PolarCube channels are selected to probe clear-air emission over vertical levels from the surface to the lower stratosphere. Operational spaceborne microwave soundings have available for decades but using lower frequencies (50-57 GHz) and from higher altitudes. While the JPSS ATMS sensor provides global coverage at ~32 km resolution PolarCube will improve on this resolution by a factor of two (~16 km), thus facilitating a key science goal of mapping sea ice concentration and extent while obtaining temperature profile data. Additionally, we seek to correlate freeze-thaw line data from the NASA SMAP mission with atmospheric temperature structure to help understand the relationship between clouds, temperature, and surface energy fluxes during seasonal transitions. PolarCube will also provide the first demonstration of a very low cost passive microwave sounder that if operated in a fleet configuration would have the potential to fulfill the goals of the Precipitation Atmospheric Temperature and Humidity (PATH) mission, as defined in the NRC Decadal Survey.",

            "abstract": "Exposures of deep crustal shear zones are fundamental records of strain localization and the temporal evolution of ductile to brittle behavior as these tectonites were exhumed to the surface. We present results from a decade of field-based research on a deeply exhumed (~35 km-paleodepths) strike-slip shear zone in the western Churchill province of the Canadian Shield. The Grease River shear zone is a >400 km-long and 7 km-thick structure that cuts the Athabasca granulite terrane, North America’s largest exposure of continental lower crust (>20,000 km2). The shear zone is dominated by granulite- to amphibolite-grade L-S and L>S tectonites characterized by penetrative NE-striking steeply-dipping foliations with gently-plunging to sub-horizontal stretching and intersection lineations. These fabrics are locally overprinted by pseudotachylyte and narrow (<500 m-thick) greenschist-grade zones of cataclasite. Dextral kinematics are defined by deflected foliation trajectories, C’ shear bands, and well-developed σ- and δ-type porphyroclasts of Kfs + Pl + Opx + Grt + Hb in felsic to intermediate granulite paragneisses and orthogneisses. Data collected along a well-exposed, nearly 150 km-long segment of the shear zone documents a >100 m.y. episodic record of transpressive to strike-slip intracontinental strain accumulation that coincided with two oppositely convergent orogenies: the east-vergent arc-continent collision of the 1.94-1.90 Ga Taltson orogen and the west-vergent continent-continent collision of the 1.9-1.8 Ga Trans-Hudson orogen. Deformation mechanisms evolved from distributed ductile dynamic recrystallization and grain-size reduction to localized pseudotachylyte development, cataclastic flow, and brittle faulting. Lower crustal behavior during strain localization was dynamic. Melt-weakened mono-cyclic crust was juxtaposed against strong isobarically-cooled poly-cyclic crust along the shear zone at 1.92-1.90 Ga. Brittle-ductile reactivation of the structure during exhumation to middle crustal levels was coincident with fluid-mediated retrograde reactions that facilitated crustal-scale segmentation and transpressive uplift of lower crustal granulites at 1.85 Ga. This study illustrates that lower crustal rheology is spatially and temporally heterogeneous.",

The ship-based (R/V Revelle and R/V Mirai) observations were parallel to those on the Gan Island, located ~800 km to the west. Analysis of the Gan Is. supersite data along with the observations from the R/V Revelle and R/V Mirai allow us to address the spatial variability of convection and environmental conditions associated with MJO initiation. The radar network also helps document the broader MJO convective envelope as it propagates slowly eastward, exiting the initiation region. Preliminary results show that the evolution of rainfall, precipitation types, and convective depth throughout the MJO life cycle are very similar between Gan Is. and R/V Revelle over the equator. On the other hand, precipitation and convection exhibit little MJO signature over R/V Mirai ~800 km off the equator. Precipitation tends to be more convective over the R/V Mirai than over the equator during DYNAMO. This study fully examines the convective properties and cloud population throughout the MJO life cycle using radar observations from these three locations.",

            "abstract": "Earth’s lower mantle occupies more than half of Earth’s volume, and is composed primarily of bridgmanites and (Mg,Fe)O “ferropericlase.” Knowledge of the behavior of lower mantle minerals is essential for interpreting complexity in the deep Earth. Although it is suggested that (Mg,Fe)O represents a major volume fraction of Earth’s interior, the iron concentration of (Mg,Fe)O is not very well constrained at all depths of the lower mantle. Near the base of the lower mantle, an enhanced iron content may be found due to melting events in Earth’s history and/or reactions with the iron-dominant liquid outer core. Here we examine the high-pressure behavior of polycrystalline (Mg,Fe)O containing 48 mol% FeO (“FP48”), loaded hydrostatically with neon as a pressure medium. Using x-ray diffraction and synchrotron Mössbauer spectroscopy we measure the equation of state of FP48 to about 80 GPa at 300 K and hyperfine parameters to 100 GPa at 300 K, respectively. A gradual volume drop is observed between ∼55 and 75 GPa. To confirm that the observed volume drop is due to a spin crossover, the quadrupole splitting (QS) and isomer shift (IS) of Fe2+ are determined as a function of pressure. At low pressures, our spectra are fitted with two Fe2+-like sites. At pressures between 43 and 81 GPa, an additional Fe2+-like site with a QS of 0 is required, indicative of low-spin iron. Above 93 GPa, two low-spin Fe2+-like sites explain the data well, signifying the completion of the spin crossover. Using a spin crossover equation of state, we have determined the volume drop at the calculated transition pressure and the relevant elastic properties of FP48. Our results are compared to previous measurements of (Mg,Fe)O with varying concentrations of iron at high pressures.",

            "abstract": "The current rate of population growth combined with climate change, have increased the impact on natural resources globally, especially water, land and energy, and therefore the food availability. Arid and semi-arid countries are highly vulnerable to these threats being already aware of the scarcity of resources depending mainly on imports. This study focuses on the UAE, with a very low rainfall, high temperatures and a very high rate of growth. It represents the perfect scenario to study the adaptive strategies that would allow to alleviate the effects of changing climate conditions and increase of population. Water is a key factor to food security especially in dry regions like the UAE, therefore, the first step of this approach is to analyze the water budget, first at a global scale (UAE), and after at smaller scales where particular and in-depth studies can be performed.\nThe water budget is represented by the following equation: total precipitation and desalinated water minus the evapotranspiration equals the change in the terrestrial water storage. The UAE is highly dependent on desalinated water, therefore, this factor is included as a water input in the water budget. The procedure adopted in this study is applicable to other Gulf countries where desalination represents a large component of the water budget. Remotely sensed data will be used to obtain the components of the water budget equation performing a preliminary study of the suitability of TRMM data to estimate the precipitation in the UAE by comparison with six ground stations in the country. GRACE and TRMM data will then be used to obtain the terrestrial water storage and the precipitation respectively. The evapotranspiration will be estimated from the water budget equation and maps of these three variables will be obtained. This spatial analysis of the water resources will help to determine the best areas for cultivation and whether it can be planned in a way that increases the agricultural productivity. Subsequent studies on land and energy resources combined with legal aspects in the UAE, will be used to obtain a food security atlas. These results will lead to a more efficient management of the resources not only on a national scale but also on a regional scale that can aid in sustainable development and a better resource use in the UAE and ultimately, in the gulf region.",

            "abstract": "Low degree partial melting of carbonated mantle peridotite generates strongly silica-undersaturated melts containing substantial amount of carbon dioxide (several tens of wt%). Kimberlite melts are one of these volatile-rich mantle product and are believed to ascent through the upper mantle and crust at great speed (~5 to 50 ms-1). The role of volatiles in propelling this ascent has remained poorly quantified due to experimental difficulties in quenching such compositions to a glass. In this study, we used a range of melt compositions in the Si-C-Al-Ca-Mg-Fe-Na-K-O system addressing the chemical complexity needed to closely mimic kimberlitic to carbonatitic characteristics. These melts can, furthermore, be quenched fast enough to produce a glass and be used to determine the CO2 solubility as a function of composition and pressure. Our results suggest that the solubility of CO2 decreases steadily with increasing amount of network forming cations from ~30 wt% CO2 at 12 wt% SiO2 down to ~3 wt% CO2 at 40 wt% SiO2 and that pressure has limited effect on the solubility of CO2 up until very shallow depth (~ last 3 km). This peculiar pressure-solubility relation in kimberlite melt can explain the highly explosive nature of kimberlite magma and characteristic geo-morphological features of their root zone. We present a general CO2 solubility model based on thermodynamic formalism covering a large range of melt composition from 11 to 53 wt% SiO2 spanning the transition from carbonatitic to basaltic melts at pressures up to 1500 MPa.",

Two ~7m outcrops of proglacial lacustrine silt are exposed along the river in which, deformed rhythmites bounded by planar laminated rhythmites have been identified. These exhibit a variety of fold geometries in outcrop and x-ray computed tomography (CT) scans, all of which show some degree of asymmetry. Initial radiocarbon ages of 14,400 and 13,300 14C yr BP have been obtained from terrestrial plant material isolated from samples near the base of one outcrop. Given the age range and laminae density, these dates suggest that the rhythmites are varves, but additional radiocarbon dates and CT-scans will be used to confirm this.\nThe deformed horizons are interpreted to be seismites formed by slumping. Earthquake shaking triggers an increase in pore fluid pressure, which destabilises the sublacustrine slope causing failure and the release of silt into the sedimentary system. As silt is transported by downslope shear it is deformed in distinct layers. Displacement of volumes of silt also causes the formation of seiche waves that apply shear stress to lake floor sediments causing further deformation. Deviations in magnetic susceptibility and the declination of magnetic remanence observed underneath and within deformed horizons are interpreted to be a response of earthquake shaking. Data from these different proxies will be presented and compiled to generate a record of earthquake shaking from the Southern Alpine Fault.",

We represent the 15 major river basins and the discharge and temperature of the streams that drain them. DHSVM-RBM integrates the Distributed Hydrologic Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) which represents the hydrologic response (river discharge) of the basins with the distributed stream temperature model RBM, which represents thermal dynamics of the streams at high temporal and spatial resolutions. We first show that the model construct is able to represent observed historic streamflow and stream temperature variations at sub-daily, seasonal, and interannual time scales. We find that the thermal load to Puget Sound varies season to season, increasing in fall and winter and decreasing in spring and summer compared with long-term base temperature. The estimated annual thermal load is around 2791 cms·K, accounted for mostly by the Skagit and Snohomish Rivers. We also explore the relative effect of projected future climate and land cover change on Puget Sound riverine thermal loadings.",

Recent geologic mapping of this area has revealed differences in soil properties over short distances within the park. We studied the chemistry of the clay minerals found within the soils to see if there was a correlation between the amounts of soil organic carbon contained in the soil and particle size in individual soil horizons. Three different vegetation areas, including an old field, a deciduous forest, and a pine forest were selected to see what influence vegetation type had on the clay chemistry and carbon levels as well. Four samples containing the O, A, and B horizons were taken from each location and we studied the carbon and nitrogen content using an elemental analyzer, particle size using a Laser Diffraction Particle Size Analyzer, and clay mineralogy with powder X-ray diffraction of each soil sample. Samples from the old field and pine forest gave an overall negative correlation between carbon content and clay percentage, which is against the normal trend for Southern Piedmont Ultisols. The deciduous forest samples gave no correlation at all between its carbon content and clay percentage. Together, all three locations show the same negative relationship, while once separated into vegetation type and A and B horizons it shows even more abnormal relationships of negative while several show no correlation (R2= 0.007403- 0.56268). Using powder XRD, we ran clay samples from each A and B horizon for the clay mineralogy. All three vegetation areas had the same results of containing quartz, kaolinite, and Fe oxides, therefore, clay chemistry is not a reason behind the abnormal trend of a negative correlation between average carbon content and clay percentage. Considering that all three locations have the same climate, topography, and parent material of metagranite, it could be reasonable to assume these results are a factor of environmental and biological influences rather than clay type.",

Geostrophic velocities and transports are calculated from temperature-salinity profiles collected at stations along the I05 and P06 sections at nominally 32°S in the Indian and Pacific Oceans in 2002-2003 and again in 2009. Velocities observations come from lowered Acoustic Current Profiler (LADCP) and geostrophic reference velocities are obtained from three different inverse models. The most robust difference between 2002 and 2009 in the Indian Ocean, common to all three models and within their uncertainties, is that the SAMW and thermocline transports are shifted to lower densities in 2009. The three models don’t show any difference in the Meridional Overturning Circulation in 2002-2003 and 2009 for the Indian and Pacific Oceans. In contrast, the net southward heat transport across 32°S for the combined Indo-Pacific section is -0.6 to -0.7±0.2 PW in 2002-2003 that is almost doubled for 2009, to -1.3 to -1.5±0.1 PW. The same pattern is observed for the freshwater transports: The net Indo-Pacific freshwater transport convergence is net evaporative for all models and both years, of 0.24 to 0.27 Sv in 2002-2003, which increases to 0.67 to 0.86 Sv in 2009.",

            "abstract": "We use measurements during the 2013 Nitrogen Oxidants Mercury and Aerosol Distributions Sources and Sinks (NOMADSS) campaign to constrain the land and ocean emissions of mercury, using a combination of forward and inverse modeling. Mercury emissions from land and ocean drive the global cycling of mercury. A recent bottom-up assessment of global mercury emissions estimated that the land and ocean sources release about 1500 and 2700 Mg yr-1 of mercury into the atmosphere, respectively. Thus, the average emission per unit area from the land is thought to exceed the ocean (Pirrone et al., Atmos. Chem. Phys., 10, 5951-5964, 2010). Considering that there are additional mercury sources from the land (e.g., anthropogenic emission and biomass burning), this emission difference should lead to higher observed mercury levels over the land compared to over the ocean. However, several very recent measurement and modeling studies challenge such understanding. The NOMADSS campaign provided a first opportunity to measure speciated mercury concentrations over both land and ocean surfaces. As shown in Table 1, the median Total Mercury (TM) concentration in 0-1 km (within the planetary boundary layer) for over-ocean flights is 0.11 ng m-3 higher (p < 0.05) than for over-land flights, whereas the over-ocean flights have lower TM concentrations in > 1 km than the over-land flights. We combine analysis of NOMADDS mercury measurements with the GEOS-Chem model, to better constrain land and ocean mercury sources. The standard GEOS-Chem model cannot reproduce the mercury concentration differences between over the land and the ocean. We improve the GEOS-Chem model’s ability to reproduce these observations by implementing updated air-sea and air-land exchange mechanisms. We find that increased ocean emissions are necessary to explain this discrepancy. These results are consistent with the inverse analysis of global GEM concentrations.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen limitation constrains primary productivity in high-latitude terrestrial ecosystems. In these ecosystems, Biological Soil Crusts (BSCs) fix the majority of nitrogen and are therefore the dominant nitrogen source to the surrounding soil. Understanding the distribution of nitrogen fixing microorganisms and the constraints on the rate at which nitrogen is fixed is important for reducing uncertainty in predictions of carbon-climate feedbacks. However, few models take into account the environmental, ecological, and energetic constraints on nitrogen fixation. Here we present and discuss a model representing the spatial distribution and activity of nitrogen-fixing and non-fixing microorganisms. We represent a number of functional guilds with different traits associated with resource acquisition (e.g., carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and molybdenum) and environmental optima (e.g., light, moisture, and temperature). The model spatially resolves the distribution of nitrogen-fixers or non-nitrogen-fixers across nutrient gradients and demonstrates seasonality in fixation rates. An important aspect of the structure of the model is the inclusion of resource acquisition investments that strongly constrains the distribution of BSCs and impacts the rates of nitrogen fixation at the ecosystem level. Reducing the uncertainty associated with predictions of the fate of high-latitude soil carbon fluxes will require a mechanistic understanding of the nitrogen cycle under a changing climate. This model can significantly contribute to that goal.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic eruptive styles are influenced both by the physical properties of the ascending magma as well as the decompression rates involved. Systematic experimental investigations of both state and rate have been performed here on analogue basaltic systems. Controlled decompression experiments were performed in a shock tube system, using a silicon oil basis as the basalt proxy. The samples were saturated with 10 MPa of Ar for 72h, followed by controlled decompression. Four series of experiments were performed: 1) Pure liquids with viscosities ranging from 1 to 1000 Pa s were used to map the liquid response. 2) Micrometric spherical particles were added to the liquid to evaluate the effect of crystal fraction. 3) The role of crystal shape was examined by using particles with different aspect ratios. 4) Finally, the effects of saturation time and of pressure were examined via a series of experiments at 24 h, performed over a range of saturation pressure.\nThe dynamics of foaming and flow of the bubbly fluid during decompression were constrained using image analysis, by measuring the height of the expanding column, as well as analyzing the bubble size distribution. At the onset a delayed nucleation event is observed. When the amount of nucleated bubbles approaches a critical thickness, a foam develops. Finally, the foam reaches equilibrium, and starts oscillating in response to the balance between foam disruption and growth. These observation may have important implications for oscillatory eruptive phenomena observed in active volcanoes (i.e. gas piston activity).\nFinally, the effect of crystals was investigated. In their presence, heterogeneous nucleation enhances the number of bubble nuclei, even at low crystal fractions. As a consequence, the foam develops earlier, and is able to ascend with major upward speed, in comparison to the pure oil.\nExperimental decompression of silicon oil has proven to be a unique tool to unravel the hidden dynamics of magma into the conduit.",

We investigate the spatial and temporal evolution of the Iberia-Newfoundland rifted margin from its Permian post-orogenic stage to early Cretaceous break-up. We have applied Quantitative Basin Analysis to integrate seismic stratigraphic interpretations and drill hole data of representative sections across the Iberia-Newfoundland margins with kinematic models for the thinning of the lithosphere and subsequent isostatic readjustment. Our goal is to predict the distribution of extension and thinning, environments of deposition, crustal structure and subsidence history as functions of space and time. The first sediments deposited on the Iberian continental crust were in response to Permian lithospheric thinning, associated with magmatic underplating and subsequent thermal re-equilibration of the lithosphere. During late Triassic-early Jurassic rifting, a broadly distributed depth-independent lithospheric extension occurred, followed by late Jurassic rifting that increasingly focused with time and became depth-dependent during the early Cretaceous. However, there exists a temporality in the along-strike deformation of the Iberia-Newfoundland margin: significant Valanginian-Hauterivian deformation characterizes the northern Galicia Bank-Flemish Cap while the southern Iberian-Newfoundland region is characterized by Tithonian-early Berriasian extension. Deformation localized with time on both margins leading to late Aptian break-up. To match the distribution and magnitude of subsidence across the profiles requires significant thinning of middle/lower crustal level and subcontinental lithospheric mantle, leading to the formation of the hyper-extended domains. The late-stage deformation of both margins was characterized by a predominantly brittle deformation of the residual continental crust, leading to exhumation of subcontinental mantle and ultimately to seafloor spreading. Our modeling results may provide critical insights into the 3D along-strike interaction of continental lithosphere thinning in terms of changing crustal structure and environments of deposition as well as implications for the regional, 3D subsidence evolution of rifted margins.",

The CALIOP lidar instrument allows to discriminate cloud and aerosol particles based on their actively sensed backscatter and depolarization properties. We focus on the eruption of the Nabro volcano in June 2011, which added about 1 Tg of SO2 to the lower stratosphere (Theys et al. 2013) and was the strongest eruption since Pinatubo in this regard.\nPrevious observational studies have come to opposite conclusions regarding the impact of volcanic aerosols on cirrus properties (Sassen 1992, Luo et al 2002). Modelling studies of the Pinatubo eruption and of stratospheric sulfate geoengineering are also ambiguous in this regard (Lohmann et al. 2003, Kuebbeler et al. 2012, Cirisan et al. 2013).\nWe find that the year-to-year variability, which is likely caused by synoptic processes and climatic oscillations such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), clearly outweighs any Nabro signal in the cirrus cloud backscatter and cirrus occurrence frequency at all latitudes both over land and ocean. We conclude that the cirrus-cloud radiative forcing caused by volcanically-induced changes in cirrus optical properties is negligible in the case of the Nabro eruption.",

            "abstract": "Fluid flow features imaged as gas flares in the water column, pockmarks and mud volcanoes on the seabed, and high-amplitude cross-cutting reflections and bright spots in the sub-surface are abundant in the SW Barents Sea offshore northern Norway. This region is covered by extensive conventional 2D and 3D deep penetration seismic reflection data and multibeam bathymetry. High-resolution 3D P-Cable seismic data have been acquired in the SW Barents Sea over the past few years to image the uppermost ca. 500 m of the sub-surface. The P-Cable system consist of 12 to 16 short streamers (25 m) that are towed on a cross-cable perpendicular to the vessel's steaming direction. This configuration allows for acquisition of seismic data with high trace density, typically with 6 m in-line separation. The vertical resolution is a good as 1-2 m using conventional site survey air gun configurations. The sedimentary succession in the SW Barents Sea consists of upper Paleozoic evaporites overlaid by Mesozoic and Cenozoic clastic sediments. There are several organic-rich intervals in the sequence, including Paleozoic coals and Triassic and Jurassic marine source rocks that are locally in the oil or gas maturation windows. Glacial erosion has locally removed kilometer thick Cenozoic and Mesozoic successions, leaving the Mesozoic and Paleozoic strata in shallow sub-surface. The new high-resolution 3D surveys have targeted shallow fluid anomalies in the subsurface. These are imaged as high-amplitude reflections in fault blocks and structural highs, locally cross-cutting well-defined Mesozoic reflections. Commonly, disturbed reflections are present in overlying sequences, or high-amplitude reflections are imaged in the glacial overburden sediments. Locally, hundreds of pockmarks are imaged by the seafloor reflection. The deep cross-cutting reflections are interpreted as hydrocarbon accumulations that locally migrate towards the surface. The fluids are stored in shallow gas pockets or leaking at the seabed forming pockmarks and flares. The high-resolution data provide new constraints on the dynamics of hydrocarbon seepage from the deep source region to the hydrosphere and atmosphere. They are also useful for exploration of shallow targets and for mapping geohazards associated with gas pockets or gas hydrates.",

            "abstract": "South China Sea basin, which evolved from Cenozoic continental margin rifting and subsequent seafloor spreading, is a classic example of a marginal sea in Western Pacific. Since the early 1980’s, several models have been proposed for the formation of this sea basin. The previous studies were based mainly on the distribution of magnetic anomaly lineation obtained from aerial and shipboard measurements. However, large water depth (over 4.5km) and thick sediment cover (up to 1km or more) make the magnetic anoamaly information not so well displayed in aerial and shipboard data. To better understand the evolution of the sea basin, we increased anomaly amplitudes by collecting magnetic data along deep-tow profiles over the magnetic lineations in the South China Sea oceanic area. The one across the southwest subsea basin was analyzed first.\nThe total field magnetic measurements were processed through filtering, resampling, diurnal variation removal, continuation to a level datum, regional field correction, projection to a common azimuth, and deskewing. A magnetic polarity reversal timescale was constructed by matching deep-tow anomalies with a simple, rectangular block magnetization model with the expansion rate for oceanic crust. We analyzed the spreading duration, rate, asymmetry, and reversal events of Southwest subbasin, in reference to the recent GTS2012 geomagnetic polarity representative data and concluded that the Southwest subbasin opened from around 21.767 Ma and stopped around C5C at about 15.974Ma. The full spreading rate varied from 8 to 40 cm/yr. Spreading is usually asymmetric by showing alternate faster spreading rate in one slab than the other in different time periods. From the comparison, several small reversal were revealed in addition to the standard geomagnetic polarity. These findings helped to understand the evolution of the Southwest subbasin of South China Sea and will also help to establish new reversal discrimination.",

            "abstract": "Paleotopography records are critical to understanding geodynamic processes in ancient mountain ranges. The imprint of topography on stable isotopes of precipitation (“water isotopes”) has become the most widely used method for reconstructing topography. Current approximations of how orographic lifting drives fractionation of water isotopes use 1D topography and a model based on either empirical observations or 1D Rayleigh fractionation. However, atmospheric physics tells us that the pattern and magnitude of lifting varies due to the shape of topography. We also know that the source of water isotopes and the local climatology (e.g., wind speed and direction, moist stability of the air) vary on both short and long time scales. Current approaches fail to separate the signal of topography from that of potentially large, short-term (<100 kyr) climate variations in water isotope records.\nWe present an isotope-enabled version of the linear theory of orographic precipitation (LTOP) of Smith and Barstad (2004), which describes the response of water isotopes to topography. This model provides a first-order approximation of the water-isotope field produced by moist air flowing over complex 3D topography, which allows us to explore how the water isotope field is influenced by variations in climatology and topography. The LTOP model is attractive because of its simplicity: just 7 variables are used calculate the water isotope field, but the model still accounts for lateral flow and upwind phase tilting due to topographic barriers (to the non-linear limit).\nWe tested this model in modern Patagonia, where there is a simple westerly pattern of atmospheric flow across a north-south mountain range. The model reproduces the strong observed fractionation and matches 166 field measurements of water isotopes in precipitation fairly well (R2 = 0.61). Sensitivity tests indicate the water isotope field is most sensitive to variations in the composition of source water (ocean), wind speed, and wind direction. Short-term climate variations are on the order of 16‰ δD; isotope records showing less variability should be treated as unreliable. The capacity of the LTOP model to describe the observed complexity of atmospheric behavior in response to 3D topography is an important step towards future advances in paleotopography work.",

            "abstract": "The presence of small amounts of H2O in the mantle beneath mid-ocean ridges (MORs) critically affects melting dynamics, resulting in increased depth of melting, total melt production, and crustal thickness. One method for estimating the amount of H2O and other volatiles in the oceanic mantle is analysis of olivine-hosted melt inclusions. Recent studies, however, demonstrate the efficiency of post-entrapment diffusive modification of H2O, so that caution must be taken when interpreting volatile concentrations of included melts. In addition, diffusive loss of H2O results in a decrease in the internal pressure of the melt inclusion, exsolution of CO2 from the included melt, and formation of a mixed-volatile vapor bubble. Although studies examining diffusive modification of melt inclusion volatile contents have focused on high-H2O melt inclusions from subduction zones, low-H2O melt inclusions from MORs are also potentially susceptible to post-entrapment diffusive modification if the external magma experiences degassing upon ascent. In order to quantitatively assess this process, we present results from a holistic numerical model, which incorporates the effects of post-entrapment modification on H2O and CO2 within the melt inclusion. The numerical model incorporates time-dependent external boundary conditions (e.g., H2O contents of the host melt), temperature, and pressure to reproduce conditions during magma ascent, cooling, and crystallization in the oceanic crust. In contrast to initially high-H2O melt inclusions from subduction zones, we demonstrate that low-H2O melt inclusions tend to preserve their pre-entrapment H2O and CO2 concentrations and provide reliable estimates for the depth of entrapment. The presence of a vapor bubble, however, may indicate that either diffusive H2O loss or post-entrapment crystallization has occurred, in which case the included melt must be corrected for exsolved CO2. Even small vapor bubbles can result in significant decreases in the CO2 contents of the melt inclusion, yielding low entrapment pressure estimates. We compare model results with available data from melt inclusions from MORs and demonstrate the necessity of correcting for the presence of vapor bubbles to obtain correct estimates of pressures and volatile contents at the time of entrapment.",

            "abstract": "Experimentally determined partition coefficients for Fe-rich metallic systems are essential to constrain models of the formation and evolution of planetary cores. Solid metal-liquid metal partition coefficients (DSol/Liq) for many siderophile elements depend upon the light-element content of the liquid phase. This dependence can be described by an empirically determined interaction parameter (β). Oxygen is a potential light element in the cores of large planetary bodies. Direct measurements of the partition coefficients between solid and liquid alloys in the Fe-O system, however, are restricted to liquids with low O contents (<2.2 wt% O at 15 GPa; Langlade et al. LPSC, 2008). Measurements to derive β-values from Soret diffusion experiments allow us to extend our investigation to the larger compositional space present at higher temperature (Brenan & Bennett, EPSL, 2010). We performed experiments at 15 GPa in a 1500-tonne multi-anvil press, using starting materials that comprised Fe, Ni and FeO powders mixed with ~200 ppm each of the platinum group metals, W, Mn, Re and Au. Run-products were analysed by electron microprobe (Fe, Ni, O) and LA-ICP-MS (PGMs, W, Mn, Re, Au). Temperature along the sample was estimated from the thickness of a spinel layer formed at the interface between the Al2O3 capsule and MgO sleeve. Initial results show siderophile elements typically display O avoidance behavior and are concentrated toward the cold, Fe-rich portion of the sample. In one experiment however, that contains W and Re in weight percent concentrations, Mn and Re are concentrated toward the O-rich portion of the sample. Au concentrations remain approximately constant along the sample length. Results are used to predict the evolution of element ratios in the outer-core during inner-core crystallization. β-values may also be used to estimate changes to DMet/Sil that arise from O dissolved in core-forming metal.",

            "abstract": "Past research indicates that clay chemistry of soil can be altered below ground following a wildfire. Higher intensity burns can alter the pre-existing clay types and transform it into another. By contemplating the composition of a soil before a wildfire starts, it is possible to determine the outcomes and negative impacts of the burned soil at various temperatures, including possible emissions of carbon and nitrogen. Through evaluating different soil samples using the Rigaku Miniflex 600 XRD powder x-ray diffractometer, the clay composition of each sample was determined to be either in the kaolinite grouping, which is a less complex structure, or in the smectite, mica, or vermiculite groupings, which are more complex structures. After examination of field data using the Costech Elemental Combustion System for elemental analysis, a trend was found that as clay complexity increases in the individual horizons, the release of carbon and nitrogen from the soil also increases versus the other less complex horizons. It can be suggested that areas holding more complex clay mineral structures have the capacity to release more carbon and nitrogen into the atmosphere when burned at higher temperatures and intensities. Using this information, it is possible to indicate those areas holding more complex clay minerals and put further protection or emphasis on ensuring their exposure to wildfire is lessened. In turn, this will reduce the amount of harmful greenhouse gases released into the surrounding environment in the event of future uncontrolled wildfires.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic tremor accompanies eruptions at basaltic ocean islands such as Kilauea, Hawai`i as well as at more silicic arc volcanoes such as Pavlof, Alaska. Tremor can be characterized by its source location, by statistically stationary frequency content, and by time-dependent features including frequency gliding. Tremor properties are governed by the underlying tremor source mechanisms, which, in turn, depend on distinct magmatic and tectonic controls such as magma composition, the volcanic plumbing system, and the regional crustal stress regime.\nKey physical relationships among various tremor properties and their main controls are, however, poorly understood. We use a machine learning method called Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to identify characteristic tremor spectra and patterns related to when they occur during multiple eruptions in Hawai`i and in Alaska. Preliminary results show that the type and location of eruptive activity partly controls spectral properties and their temporal evolution. On Kilauea, broadband tremor (0.5-6 Hz) during eruptions associated with East Rift Zone intrusions in 2007 and 2011 differed from tremor during explosive activity at the summit in 2008. Narrowband tremor (0.5-3 Hz) on Pavlof during an eruption with a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 2 in 2007 was slightly weaker than during a VEI 3 eruption in 2013, but did not show strong changes in character between the two eruptions.\nSOMs are a powerful tool to analyze long timeseries such as continuous seismic data from multiple eruptions, which are becoming increasingly common in volcano seismology. We show that SOMs can reliably detect changes in spectral properties that constrain characteristic time scales for plausible tremor source mechanisms. By applying SOMs to tremor from different tectonic settings we identify chief similarities and differences, which ultimately help to determine the influence of various tectonic and magmatic controlling factors on volcanic tremor.",

            "abstract": "Sphagnum peatlands are characterized by distinctive vegetation, hydrology and local climate. They are very important areas for flora and fauna. In the last decade, much effort was made at better understanding of microrefugia and their important role in post-glacial migration of various plant species. The aim of this study is to explain a long-term persistence of the glacial relict Betula nana in a Sphagnum peatland in northern Poland far from the southern range of its natural distribution. We suppose that the persistence of Betula nana is driven by a) the morphology and geology of the catchment, b) the maintenance of open vegetation on the peatland surface and c) exceptional microclimatic and hydrological conditions. A detailed research was carried out on the peat profile using pollen analysis, to reconstruct the presence of open habitat on the mire during the Holocene. Furthermore, detailed monitoring of local climate, hydrology of the peatland and the surrounding area was conducted. The pollen analysis revealed a continuous presence of Betula nana in the postglacial history of the peatland. The results of local climate monitoring indicated that the mire possesses a typical microclimate, with air temperature amplitude much higher in relation to the open area, in particular during the growing season. This, in combination with the hydrology, which depends on the geology of the surrounding area, affects Betula nana population. Linje mire is a unique microrefugium sustained by local factors such as microclimate, geology, local relief and hydrology. However, it is still challenging to explain the intriguing case why this species still occurs within the study site.\nThis work was funded by the National Science Centre grant NN306060940 and Polish-Swiss Research Programme PSPB-013/2010.

This interest calls for the need to explore the potential convergence of the current atttribution science with the desire and needs of stakeholders. Such an euiry contributes to the development of climate services aiming at quantifying the human responsibility for particular events.\nThrough interviews with climate scientists, through the analysis of the press coverage of extreme meteorological events, and through stakeholder (private sector, covernment services and local and regional government) focus groups, we analyze how social representations of the concepts associated with extreme event attribution are theorized. From the corpuses generated in the course of this enquiry, we build up a grounded, bottom-up, theorization of extreme weather event attribution. This bottom-up theorization allows for a framing of the potential climate services in a way that is attuned to the needs and expectations of the stakeholders.\nFrom apparently simple formulations: “what is an extreme event?”, “what makes it extreme?”, “what is meant by attribution of extreme weather events?”, “what do we want to attribute?”, “what is a climate service?”, we demonstrate the polysemy of these terms and propose ways to address the challenges associated with the juxtaposition of four highly loaded concepts: extreme – event – attribution – climate services.",

            "abstract": "Chemical composition and hygroscopicity are keys to understand the formation and evolution of atmospheric aerosol particles. However, relatively little information is available for sub-10 nm nanoparticles due to experimental difficulties. We present the design of a nano-cloud condensation nuclei (nano-CCN) counter for the purpose of measuring hygroscopicity and interpreting chemical compositions of sub-10 nm nanoparticles. Advanced than the previous studies (Kulmala et al., 2007;Mordas et al., 2008), here we explained the meaning of counting efficiency spectra of condensation particle counter (CPC) and its link to the CCN activation spectra, providing theoretical basis for the modification of CPC to a nano-CCN counter. Since CCN hygroscopicity has been demonstrated as an effective parameter reflecting organic and inorganic mass fractions, the nano-CCN counter may thus provide size-resolved information on the chemical composition of sub-10 nm nanoparticles.\nThe application was demonstrated through both by laboratory experiments and literature data on 2.5-nm particles. With a modified TSI 3788 water-CPC, sodium chloride (NaCl) and ammonium sulfate (AS) particles with 2.5 nm can be easily distinguished according to the activation spectra. Meanwhile, an indirect approach is also used to test the applicability of Köhler theory in the activation of nanoparticles, and the result showed that it still holds qualitatively (See Fig.1). This study improved and extended the understanding and application of CPC counting efficiency spectra. Though named nano-CCN counter, the design is not limited to the water-CPC, but also applies to CPCs of other working fluid (e.g. butanol). A combination of CPCs with multiple working fluids, as well as other instrumentations such as nano-HTDMA, might provide further insight into the chemical composition of nanoparticles, and the roles of diverse compounds in the initial steps of atmospheric new particle formation.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide with high precision and accuracy have become increasingly important for climate change research, in particular to inform terrestrial biosphere models. Anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel burning have long been recognized to contribute a significant portion of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Here, we present an approach to remove the traffic related carbon dioxide emissions from mole fractions measured at a tall tower by using the corresponding carbon monoxide measurements in combination with footprint analyses and transport modeling. This technique improves the suitability of the CO2 data to be used in inverse modeling approaches of atmosphere-biosphere exchange that do not account for non-biotic portions of CO2. In our study region in Oregon, road traffic emissions are the biggest source of anthropogenic carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. A three-day mobile campaign covering 1700 km of roads in northwestern Oregon was performed during summer of 2012 using a laser-based Cavity Ring Down Spectrometer. The mobile measurements incorporated different roads including main highways, urban streets, and back-roads, largely within the typical footprint of a tall CO2 observation tower in Oregon’s Willamette Valley. For the first time, traffic related CO:CO2 emission ratios were measured directly at the sources during an on-road campaign under a variety of different driving conditions. An average emission ratio of 7.43 (±1.80) ppb CO per ppm CO2 was obtained for the study region and applied to separate the traffic related portion of CO2 from the mole fraction time series. The road traffic related portion of the CO2 mole fractions measured at the tower site reached maximum values from 9.8 to 12 ppm, depending on the height above the surface, during summer 2012.",

A strong cold air from the Western Siberia started affecting the Northern parts of China on April 22, 2014. On April 23-24, 2014, a massive dust storm blanketed the Northwest China including Xinjiang, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Shanxi provinces. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra images clearly show the long range transport of dust storms. Higher concentrations of atmospheric (satellite aerosol optical depth – AOD) and air quality (PM10 and PM2.5) were observed after the dust event. The Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model was used to produce forward dispersion patterns of pollutants from the source locations. It is found that the dust disperse from west to east in the Northwest region of China. We have considered three locations along dust flow (Urumchi in Xinjiang, Jiayuguan in Gansu, and Yinchuan in Ningxia provinces). Using Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and ground data, we have analyzed changes in carbon monoxide (CO), water vapor, and relative humidity (RH) at different pressure levels with the dust storms. The results show distinct differences in these meteorological parameters during dusty days at the three locations. Our analysis shows changes in total column CO, ground and upper layer CO concentrations, water vapor mass mixing ratio and relative humidity. The changes in atmospheric and meteorological parameters and their impacts on the regional weather and climate will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Enceladus is an intriguing planetary body, which possibly has the ingredients needed for life. Further, it has numerous (over 100) continuously erupting geysers that eject material into the atmosphere which provide a unique opportunity to sample the body’s internal chemistry from orbit. At JPL’s Planetary Science Summer School, Team X and a group of students developed a mission concept to directly sample Enceladus’ plumes. The mission, named Enceladus Environmental Explorer (EVE), follows NASA’s Planetary Science Decadal survey and would assess the potential habitability of Saturn’s icy satellite through analysis of the chemistry of the subsurface ocean and the nature of the organic chemistry in the plume. EVE would look at geological and geophysical surface processes of Enceladus by investigating the heat output of Enceladus, plumes’ mechanics, the extent of the liquid subsurface reservoir(s), and gravitational variation. The EVE mission concept aimed for a January 2023 launch on an Atlas 551 class launch vehicle and would arrive at Saturn July 2031. A two-year-long Saturn moon tour would allow sufficient deceleration to permit a polar orbital insertion around Enceladus in March 2035, remaining stable for 54 weeks of observation. The proposed instrument payload includes: 1) SUb MilliMeter Enceladus Radiometer (SUMMER; equivalent to Rosetta MIRO), 2) Enceladus Dust and Gas Experiment (EDGE; an enhanced version of Rosetta COSIMA), 3) MAGnetometer for Ionic Concentration (MAGIC; equivalent to MMS/ InSIGHT magnetometer), 4) Visual Imaging Camera with Topographic Observational Resolution (VICTOR) and 5) Enceladus Radio Gravity Science (ERGS). Our suggested orbital timeline would allow the most comprehensive dataset yet collected of a moon in the outer solar system, mapping the entire surface twice with SUMMER and VICTOR, while sampling the plume directly 232 times with EDGE. MAGIC would also provide over a year of sampling of the magnetic field variations from orbit. Enceladus Environmental Explorer (EVE) offers a unique opportunity to determine the potential for life on Enceladus.",

            "abstract": "In the present climate, the ocean below 2 km is mainly filled by waters sinking into the abyss around Antarctica and in the North Atlantic. Paleo proxies indicate that waters of North Atlantic origin were instead absent below 2 km at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), resulting in an expansion of the volume occupied by Antarctic origin waters. I will argue that this rearrangement of deep water masses is dynamically connected to the expansion of summer sea ice around Antarctica. A simple theory will be introduced to suggest that these deep waters only came to the surface under summer sea ice, which insulated them from atmospheric forcing, and were weakly mixed with overlying waters, thus being able to store carbon for long times. I will show that this unappreciated link between the expansion of sea ice and the appearance of a voluminous and insulated water mass appear to be crucial in explaining the ocean's role in regulating atmospheric carbon dioxide on glacial-interglacial timescales.",

            "abstract": "The upwelling of bottom waters through density surfaces in the deep ocean is not possible unless the sloping nature of the sea floor is taken into account. The bottom‐‑intensified mixing arising from interaction of internal tides and geostrophic motions with bottom topography implies that mixing is a decreasing function of height in the deep ocean. This would further imply that the diapycnal motion in the deep ocean is downward, not upwards as is required by continuity. This conundrum regarding ocean mixing and upwelling in the deep ocean will be resolved by appealing to the fact that the ocean does not have vertical side walls. Implications of the conundrum for the representation of ocean mixing in climate models will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Since the Curiosity rover's landing in Gale crater on the surface of Mars, the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) on board the rover has been conducting the first-ever measurements of the Martian surface radiation field. This field is induced by Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) and their interactions with the atoms of the Martian atmosphere and soil. Furthermore, sporadic Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events can lead to large, but short-term enhancements in the intensity of the radiation field. A large part of the radiation environment is made up of charged particles, e.g., ions and their isotopes, electrons, and positrons amongst others. There are mainly two factors influencing the surface radiation field: the modulation of the incoming GCR flux due to the solar magnetic field correlating with the solar cycle; the amount of atmospheric column mass above Gale crater resulting in changes of GCR penetration depth into the atmosphere, as well as influencing the secondary particle production rate. Here, we focus on the temporal evolution of the radiation environment since the landing, analyzing changes in the measured particle spectra for different phases in the Martian seasonal cycle and solar activity. Furthermore, we present enhancements in the proton flux during directly observed SEP events.",

            "abstract": "Up until recently the orthopyroxenite ALH 84001 and basaltic breccia NWA 7034 were the only martian meteorites that did not fit within the common SNC types. However with the discovery of Northwest Africa (NWA) 8159, the diversity is expanded further with a third unique non-SNC meteorite type. The existence of meteorite types beyond the narrow range seen in SNCs is what might be expected from a random cratering sampling of a volcanically long-lived and geologically complex planet such as Mars. NWA 8159, a fine-grained, augite basalt, is a new type of martian meteorite, with SNC-like oxygen isotopes and Fe/Mn values, but having several characteristics that make it distinct from other known martian meteorite types. NWA 8159 is the only martian basalt type known to have augite as the sole pyroxene phase in its mineralogy. NWA 8159 is unique among martian meteorites in that it possesses both crystalline plagioclase and shock amorphized plagioclase, often observed within a single grain, the bracketing of plagioclase amorphization places the estimated peak shock pressures at >15 GPa and <23 GPa. Magnetite in NWA 8159 is exceptionally pure, whereas most martian meteorites contain solid-solution titano-magnetites, and this pure magnetite is a manifestation of the highest oxygen fugacity (fO2) yet observed in a martian meteorite. Although NWA 8159 has the highest fO2 of martian meteorites, it has a pronounced light rare earth (LREE) depletion pattern similar to that of very low fO2 basaltic shergottites such as QUE 94201. Thus NWA 8159 displays a striking exception to well documented correlation between fO2 and LREE patterns in SNC meteorites. Finally, NWA 8159 stands apart from other martian meteorites in that it has an an early Amazonian age that is not represented in the SNCs, ALH 84001, or the NWA 7034 pairing group. NWA 8159 appears to be from an eruptive flow or shallow intrusion that is petrologically distinct from shergottite basalts, and its crystallization age argues that it is also temporally distant from the known time interval of shergottite magmatic activity. The decoupling of fO2 and LREE from classic SNC correlations also argues that NWA 8159 was possibly derived from a different mantle/crust source region suggesting the existence of a geochemically heterogeneous martian interior.",

            "abstract": "The Hawaii-Emperor seamount chain stretches over 6000 km from the Big Island of Hawaii to the subduction cusp off Kamchatka and represents a near-continuous record of hotspot volcanism since the Late Cretaceous. The load of these seamounts and islands has caused the underlying lithosphere to deform, developing a flexural flanking moat that is now largely filled with volcanoclastic sediments. Because the age differences between the seafloor and the seamounts vary by an order of magnitude or more along the chain, the Hawaii-Emperor chain and surrounding area is considered a natural laboratory for lithospheric flexure and has been studied extensively in order to infer the rheology of the oceanic lithosphere. While most investigations have focused on the Hawaiian Islands and proximal seamounts (where data sets are more complete, including seismic reflection and refraction, swath bathymetry and even mapping and dating of drowned reef terraces), far fewer studies have examined the flexural deformation beneath the remote Emperor chain. Preliminary analysis of satellite altimetry data shows the flexural moats to be associated with very large negative gravity anomalies relative to the magnitudes of the positive anomalies over the loads, suggesting considerable viscous or viscoelastic relaxation since the loads were emplaced 50-80 Myr ago. In our study, we will attempt to model the Emperor seamount chain load as a superposition of individual elliptical Gaussian seamounts with separate loading histories. We use Optimal Robust Separation (ORS) techniques to extract the seamount load from the regional background bathymetry and partition the residual load into a set of individual volcanoes. The crustal age grid and available seamount dates are used to construct a temporal loading model and evaluate the flexural response of the lithosphere beneath the Emperor seamounts. We explore a variety of rheological models and loading scenarios that are compatible with the inferred load sizes and observed gravity anomalies, with emphasis on the temporal-spatial variation in vertical deformation along the hotspot chain, and examine their implications for the tilting history of the loads and the stratigraphic “architecture” of their flanking flexural moats.",

            "abstract": "The mechanisms of continental lithosphere deformation that control the formation and evolution of rift systems leading to continental breakup and the creation of divergent plate boundaries represent a long-standing problem in tectonics. Studies conducted in present-day rifted margins and their onshore fossil analogues reveal variable crustal architecture emphasizing the complex spatial and temporal evolution of rift systems. The Bay of Biscay and Pyrenees, at the transition between the Iberian and European plates, correspond to a Late Jurassic to Mid Cretaceous rift system. The transition from preserved oceanic and rift domains to the West to their complete inversion in the East enables the investigation of seismically imaged, drilled and exposed parts of a rift system. We combine observations from seismic reflection data, gravity inversion results and field mapping to identify and map former rift domains from the Bay of Biscay margins to onshore fossil analogues preserved in the Pyrenean orogen. The results of this mapping emphasize the existence of spatially disconnected and strongly segmented rift systems preserved along the paleo Iberian-European plate boundary. Based on their restoration, subsidence and deformation history, we illustrate the evolution of strain partitioning between them and present the implications at the scale of the Iberian-European plate boundary. The deformation history suggested is more complex than previously assumed, highlighting the polyphased evolution of this plate boundary. We propose that the onset of the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous rifting was partitioned between a set of distinct left-lateral transtensional rift systems. A plate kinematic reorganization at Aptian-Albian time resulted in the onset of seafloor spreading in the Western Bay of Biscay and extreme crustal and lithosphere thinning in intra-continental rift basins to the east. Finally, the results of this work may provide insights on: (1) processes preceding break-up and the initiation of segmented and strongly oblique shear margins, (2) the deformation history of nascent divergent plate boundaries, and (3) the kinematics of the southern North Atlantic and Alpine domain in Western Europe.",

            "abstract": "High-resolution multibeam bathymetry and chirp seismic reflection profiles collected with MBARI’s mapping autonomous underwater vehicle reveal the fine-scale morphology and shallow seafloor structure of the flanks and floor of Barkley Canyon on the Cascadia continental margin off British Columbia. The surveys characterize the environment surrounding three nodes on the Neptune Canada cabled observatory located within the canyon. The canyon floor between 960 and 1020 m water depth lacks channeling and contains ≥ 24 m of acoustically uniform sediment fill, which is ponded between the canyon’s steep sidewalls. The fill overlies a strong reflector that outlines an earlier, now buried, canyon floor channel system. Debris flow tongues contain meter scale blocks sticking-up through the fill. Apparently the present geomorphology surrounding the Canyon Axis node in 985 m is attributable to local debris flows, rather than organized down canyon processes. In the survey area the canyon sidewalls extend ~300 m up and in places the slope of the canyons sides exceed 40°. Both the Hydrate node in 870 m water depths and the Mid-Canyon node at 890 m are located on a headland that forms intermediate depth terraces on the canyon’s western flank. While the seafloor immediately surrounding the Mid-canyon node is smooth, the Hydrate node is marked by 10 circular mounds up to 2 m high and 10 m in diameter, presumable associated with hydrate formation. Although wedges of sediment drape occur in places on the canyon sides, the chirp profiles show no detectible sediment drape at either node site and suggest these nodes are situated on older, presumably pre-Quaternary strata. The lack of reflectors in the chirp profiles indicates most of the canyon’s sidewalls are largely sediment-bare. Lineations in the bathymetry mark the exposed edges of truncated beds. Rough, apparently fresh textures, within slide scarps show the importance of erosion on the development of the canyon flanks.",

            "abstract": "To understand the mechanisms of hydrological and biogeochemical processes of forest ecosystems, long term monitoring of changes in water and chemical budgets after forest disturbance is important. Previous studies have generally focused on changes in stream runoff and water chemistry. However, the long term changes in forest-canopy ecosystems such as rainfall partitioning and the chemical budget of the canopy have not been sufficiently considered. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the long-term changes of input and output budgets of water and chemistry after clear-cutting of forest catchment.\nThe study was conducted in a pair of small headwater catchments, one of which was clear-cut in 1999 and then planted with the same species in 2000; the other served as a control. After forest cutting, annual runoff increased 200–300 mm/yr and the higher runoff still remained 14 years later. The interception ratio in the clear-cut catchment was less than 10% of precipitation, whereas that in the control catchment was 20–24% of precipitation. Interception rate was still lower in the young forest compared with the mature forest, despite similar transpiration rate. With regard to chemistry, Cl− and SO42- concentrations in stream water decreased after cutting and remained lower 14 years later. On the other hand, NO3− concentration increased and finally returned to its pre-cut level. The atmospheric deposition inputs, such as those of Cl−, Na+, and SO42−, remained lower in the clear-cut catchment than in the control. On the other hand, input of K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ originating from canopy leaching became significantly higher in the clear-cut catchment compared with those in the control. These results suggest that not only the biological processes such as water and chemical uptake by plants, but also changes in canopy physical processes such as canopy interception and chemical scavenging, affected the long-term response of stream runoff and chemistry following the cutting.",

ARTisticc’s goal is to apply innovative standardized transdisciplinary art and science integrative approaches to foster robust, socially, culturally and scientifically, community centred adaptation to climate change. The approach used in the project is based on the strong understanding that adaptation is:\n(a) still \"a concept of uncertain form”; (b) a concept dealing with uncertainty; (c) a concept that calls for an analysis that goes beyond the traditional disciplinary organization of science, and; (d) an unconventional process in the realm of science and policy integration.\nThe project is centered on case studies in France, Greenland, Russia, India, Canada, Alaska, and Senegal. In every site we jointly develop artwork while we analyzing how natural science, essentially geosciences can be used in order to better adapt in the future, how society adapt to current changes and how memories of past adaptations frames current and future processes. Artforms are mobilized in order to share scientific results with local communities and policy makers, this in a way that respects cultural specificities while empowering stakeholders, ARTISTICC translates these “real life experiments” into stories and artwork that are meaningful to those affected by climate change.\nThe scientific results and the culturally mediated productions will thereafter be used in order to co-construct, with NGOs and policy makers, policy briefs, i.e. robust and scientifically legitimate policy recommendations regarding coastal adaptation. This co-construction process will be in itself analysed with the goal of increasing arts and science’s performative functions in the universe of evidence-based policy making.\nThe project involves scientists from natural sciences, the social sciences and the humanities, as well as artitis from the performing arts (playwriters, film directors) as well as the visual arts (photographs, designers, sculptor) working in France, Senegal, India, Russia, Greenland, Alaska, and Canada",

            "abstract": "The Cryosat (CS) radar altimeter provides estimates of surface height change, including summer melt and winter snow accumulation, from some Arctic ice caps. The Barnes Ice Cap on Baffin Island, Canada represents the most straightforward situation; essentially snow over ice at all elevations. As illustrated below, the average summer height losses on Barnes were 1.69 ± .36 m (2011), 2.39 ± .36 m (2012), and 1.44 ± .37 m (2013), values which were not balanced by the winter snow accumulation; 0.77 ± .39 m (2011/12), 0.93 ± .33 m (2012/13) and 1.19 ± .43 m (2013/14). However, results from most Arctic ice caps are more complicated: For example, Austfonna in the Eurasian Arctic has a maritime climate with relatively high accumulation and winter conditions that can vary from very cold to rain. Consequently, the distribution of different snow and ice zones varies with position, elevation and time. This leads to a complicated and varying bias between the heights estimated from the radar altimeter waveforms and the physical surface. Nevertheless, under melting conditions the radar returns are dominated by surface backscatter so that observations at the beginning and end of each melt season can provide estimates of net winter accumulation and summer height loss. Results for two Cryosat calibration-validation sites; the Devon Ice Cap in Canada and Austfonna on Svalbard, will be compared with surface and airborne data. Also, estimates of the height and volume change associated with the current surge of basin 3 in Austfonna, which began in earnest in the summer of 2012, will be shown.",

Pristine but non-primary components from photochemical reactions (likely from biogenic marine vapor emissions) add carboxylic acid groups. Non-pristine contributions include shipping effluent in seawater and ship emissions, which add additional alkane groups (up to 70%), and coastal or continental emissions mix in alkane and carboxylic acid groups. The pristine primary marine (ocean-derived) organic aerosol composition is nearly identical to model generated primary marine aerosol particles from bubbled seawater, indicating that its overall functional group composition is the direct consequence of the organic constituents of the seawater source.\nWhile the seawater organic functional group composition was nearly invariant across all three ocean regions studied and the ratio of organic carbon to sodium (OC/Na+) in the generated primary marine aerosol particles remained nearly constant over a broad range of chlorophyll-a concentrations, the generated primary marine aerosol particle alkane group fraction increased with chlorophyll-a concentrations. In addition, the generated primary marine aerosol particles have a hydroxyl group absorption peak location characteristic of monosaccharides and disaccharides, where the seawater hydroxyl group peak location is closer to that of polysaccharides.\n",

The mapping will eventually include data at both low and high spatial resolution, while for the present we concentrate on only the low-resolution data that provide thermal polarization. These data are sufficient to examine not only surface effective dielectric constant but seasonal and diurnal surface temperature variations, which we compare with current CIRS results. The map of effective dielectric constant allows us to explore possible regional variations in surface properties and composition. Finally, these data allow us to understand the nature and magnitude of systematic errors in the map-making process, essential to interpreting both the present maps and the forthcoming high-resolution maps based on these.

            "abstract": "Coastal aquifers are important resources for water supply, and are increasingly stressed by population increase and the growing water demand for irrigation and other uses. Concern exists that these current pressures will be compunded by the adverse impacts of future environmental change, in particular sea-level rise. Numerous studies have investigated the effect of the expected sea-level rise durring the 21st century on the salintiy distribution in coastal groundwater systems. In many of these studies, the predicted changes due to an increase in sea level are typically seen as a departure from a steady-state situation. But many other studies have provided abundant evidence that groundwater systems in coastal areas are not in equilibrium with the present-day boundary conditions, i.e., coastline configuration and climate. This is borne out by, for example, the salinity distribution of groundwater, which does not obey the classical configuration of an intruded wedge of seawater extending inland from the coastline. This paper will argue that coastal aquifers systems are in a continuous state of transition. The relevance of future environmental change within the context of long-term trends will be discussed and exemplified by case studies of coastal aquifers in different parts of the world. It will be argued that the conceptualization of coastal groundwater systems, and in particular the connection between their onshore and offshore parts, is a major source of uncertainty in studies that aim to quantify the impact of sea-level rise on coastal groundwater resources.",

            "abstract": "In xeric environments, where soils can remain dry for more than 6 months, abrupt transitions from dry-to-wet conditions produce NO pulses within seconds after soils wet up. During these periods of intense gaseous N production, biological processes (nitrification and denitrification) are known to control NO fluxes, but it is not clear how soil microbes can recover from drought-induced stress within seconds after soils wet up. Are NO pulses immediately following rewetting more so controlled by abiotic NO-producing reactions? Because biotic and abiotic mechanisms can occur simultaneously, distinguishing between these processes can be problematic. To understand the contribution of biotic and abiotic processes to NO pulses, and to better inform biogeochemical models, we measured the δ15N- and δ18O-NO following a field soil rewetting experiment in a California annual grassland. In October, during the end of the dry season, we artificially watered soils and captured NO emissions for up to 15 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day, and 3 days after wet-up. Pulses of NO following the wetting of dry soil were explained by a two-component mixing model, where two distinct sources or processes produced NO. Within 15 minutes after soil wet-up, the isotopic composition of soil NO (δ15N =-8.95 ‰, δ18O=14.28 ‰) was similar to that of atmospheric samples (δ15N =-4.45 ‰, δ18O=15.20 ‰), but became increasingly depleted after 1 hour (δ15N =-21.08 ‰, δ18O=0.53 ‰), and more so after 1 day (δ15N =-37.44 ‰, δ18O=-9.45 ‰). After 3 days, the isotopic composition of NO (δ15N =-28.31 ‰, δ18O=-2.07 ‰) began to return to pre-wet-up conditions closely following the two-component mixing line. We conclude that NO-producing reactions immediately after the wetting of dry soil (up to 15 min) are different than those occurring after 1 hour post-wetting. We hypothesize that abiotic processes control the initial response to wetting, but that biological processes, which discriminate against heavier isotopes, begin to operate within 1 hour post-wetting. Ongoing isotope enrichment techniques will be used to further understand mechanisms of NO production following the wetting of dry soil.",

All instruments were collocated at the Maggie Valley site of the Integrated Precipitation Hydrology Experiment (IPHEx) field campaign. This field campaign was a joint effort between NASA’s Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) ground validation program, Duke University, and NOAA’s Hydrometeorology Testbed – South East. Collocated measurements were conducted for three rain events during May 10-15, 2014. Among these events, one of them was a heavy rain event (conditional mean rain rate of 18.7 mm h-1) and the other two were light rain events (conditional rain rates of 2.5 and 2.7 mm h-1). This comparative study seeks the degree of agreement among precipitation measuring instruments for the rain total, raindrop size distribution, and fall velocity. Findings of these comparisons along with the microphysical observations by the HOD and the 2DVD will be presented.",

The goal of this instrument is to observe and detect the Hanle eﬀect in the scattered Lyman-Alpha UV (121.6nm) light emitted by the Sun’s Chromosphere to make measurements of the magnetic ﬁeld in this region. In order to make accurate measurements of this eﬀect, the performance characteristics of the three on-board charge-coupled devices (CCDs) must meet certain requirements. These characteristics include: quantum eﬃciency, gain, dark current, noise, and linearity. Each of these must meet predetermined requirements in order to achieve satisfactory performance for the mission. The cameras must be able to operate with a gain of no greater than 2 e­-/DN, a noise level less than 25e−, a dark current level which is less than 10e−/pixel/s, and a residual non-linearity of less than 1%. Determining these characteristics involves performing a series of tests with each of the cameras in a high vacuum environment. Here we present the methods and results of each of these performance tests for the CLASP flight cameras.",

            "abstract": "The structural evolution of low-density snow under a high temperature gradient over a short period usually takes place in the surface layers during diurnal recrystallization or on a clear, cold night. To relate snow microstructures with their thermal properties, we combined X-ray computed microtomography (micro-CT) observations with numerical simulations. Different types of snow were tested over a large range of TGs (100 K m-1- 500 K m-1). The Specific Surface Area (SSA) was used to characterize the temperature gradient metamorphism (TGM). The magnitude of the temperature gradient and the initial snow type both influence the evolution of SSA. The SSA evolution under TGM was dominated by grain growth and the formation of complex surfaces. Fresh snow experienced a logarithmic decrease of SSA with time, a feature been observed previously by others [Calonne et al., 2014; Schneebeli and Sokratov, 2004; Taillandier et al., 2007]. However, for initial rounded and connected snow structures, the SSA will increase during TGM. Understanding the SSA increase is important in order to predict the enhanced uptake of chemical species by snow or increase in snow albedo.\nCalonne, N., F. Flin, C. Geindreau, B. Lesaffre, and S.

            "abstract": "Temperature has been used for many years to characterize flow in fractured rock systems. Fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing (DTS) was adopted by the oil/gas industry over two decades ago for monitoring processes in deep fractured rock environments. Improvements in DTS system resolutions, methodology advancements, and improved data processing techniques have caused recent popularity for shallow fractured rock hydrogeologic applications. A powerful advance in DTS methodology is the use of response data collected during active cable heating. When applied to borehole applications active heating creates a thermal disequilibrium in the aquifer system that enhances the detection of groundwater flow. Active DTS has been applied to open borehole environments; however, characterization methods based on open borehole measurements are limited in that only the effects of unnatural flow (i.e. vertical cross-connection and redistribution of flow creating local, induced flows) can be observed. To characterize natural gradient flow processes borehole effects need to be minimized.\nThe literature shows borehole sealing using flexible impervious fabric liners creates a static water column in the well that eliminates the negative effects of cross-connection. Measurements in this sealed environment have been shown by others to be representative of natural gradient flow conditions, rather than the conditions created by the borehole short circuiting units or fractures with varying hydraulic head. A new method for flow system characterization using active DTS in sealed boreholes has been developed with excellent prospects for quantitation of natural gradient groundwater fluxes and related hydraulic properties. This project demonstrates the utility of using an analytical solution for calculating apparent thermal conductivities and natural gradient groundwater fluxes at depth-discrete intervals observed continuously along a borehole using active DTS. Groundwater flux data can then be used in conjunction with other site datasets (e.g. gradients) to estimate profiles of formation hydraulic properties including transmissivity.",

            "abstract": "Sulfur dioxide, the third most abundant volatile component from volcanic eruptions, can cause both global and regional climate changes once injected into the stratosphere. The quantification of the amount of SO2 emitted during an eruption is a long-term scientific goal in volcanology and climate research. Techniques to estimate sulfur yield to the atmosphere include the petrological method, remote sensing of gas compositions and sulfur measurement in ice-cores. However, the SO2 amounts measured by the latter two methods are often one to two orders of magnitude greater than the petrological estimates based on melt inclusion data. Here, we hypothesize that the inferred “excess sulfur” is a consequence of sulfur loss from the melt to the exsolved volatiles during second boiling. We test this hypothesis with a bubble growth model that includes sulfur kinetics and that allows us to track sulfur partitioning during second boiling and syneruptive decompression. Results show that before eruptions, large amount of S can be stored in gas. Thus the sulfur mass delivered to the atmosphere deduced from melt inclusion data could be greatly hampered by the second boiling process. Our results also explain the loss of S in the melt during crystallization, i.e. melt trapped by melt inclusion late in the crystallization process yield a melt significantly depleted in S, which is often observed in melt inclusion datasets from a single eruption. Our results imply that for most explosive eruptions, the S mass balance derived from melt inclusions could greatly underestimate the S content of the primitive magma. Our degassing model shows that apparent excess S are likely the result of a sampling bias associated with the melt inclusion record",

            "abstract": "Paleomagnetic studies of Apollo samples suggest that the Moon generated a magnetic field with surface field intensities of several tens of microteslas until at least 3.56 billion years ago (Ga). The field then declined by an order of magnitude from 3.56 - 3.19 Ga. Because of difficulties in reproducing such a long-lived and intense field with convection-driven dynamos, a dynamo driven by precession of the mantle relative to the core was proposed as an alternative. However, there have not been any detailed numerical models demonstrating the feasibility, lifetime, and intensity of such a lunar dynamo. Using fully 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we determined the strength and duration of a mechanically-driven dynamo powered by mantle precession. We found that this mechanism was capable of not only generating the 10-100μT paleomagnetic intensities observed in Apollo samples aged between 4.25 and 3.56 Ga, but also reproducing the precipitous decline in paleointensity beyond 3.56 Ga as the obliquity of the Moon decreased below 15°.",

            "abstract": "Uncertainties on the importance of environmental controls on soil C stabilization and turnover limit accurate predictions of the rate and magnitude of the response of soils to climate change. Here we report results from a study of interactions among vegetation and soil microbial communities in North American forests across a highly constrained, 22OC gradient mean annual temperature (MAT) as a proxy for understanding changes with climate. Previous work indicated that turnover and amount of labile SOC responded negatively to MAT, whereas stable SOC was insensitive to temperature variation. Hardwood forests stored a larger amount of stable SOC, but with shorter mean residence times than paired pine forests. Our findings suggest that the interaction between vegetation composition and microbial communities may affect SOC accumulation and stabilization responses to rising temperature. To investigate these relationships, we characterized the microbial communities with Phospholipid Fatty Acid (PLFA) analysis. PLFA analyses indicate complex microbial responses to increased MAT and vegetation composition. Microbial biomass declined with MAT in conifer forests and increased in hardwood forests. Relative abundance of actinomycetes increased with MAT for both forest types, and was correlated with amount and turnover of active SOC. The relative abundance of fungi decreased with increasing MAT, while gram+ bacteria increased, such that fungi:bacteria ratio decreased with MAT, with this trend being more pronounced for hardwood cover type. These results are consistent with a long-term warming experiment in a hardwood forest at the Harvard Forest LTER site, where after 12 years of warming the relative abundance of gram positive bacteria and actinomycetes increased, while fungal biomass decreased. In contrast, relationships between microbial groups and the stable fraction of SOC along the gradient were only observed in conifers. Increases in mean residence time of stable SOC were correlated with higher relative abundance of actinomycetes and gram+ bacteria, and a decrease in fungi:bacteria ratio. PLFA analyses show that the composition of the microbial community may explain the greater temperature effect on labile C decomposition, but not the lack of a MAT effect on the turnover of stable SOC.",

            "abstract": "The Pamir region of the India-Eurasia collision zone is the site of a rare geological phenomenon: ongoing subduction of continental crust. We investigate the surface expression of continental subduction in the region by modeling the distribution and magnitude of strain rates and quantifying the effects of body forces (gravitational potential energy) and boundary forces in driving surface deformation.\nWe first construct kinematic strain rate and velocity fields on a 0.25° by 0.25° grid using continuous spline interpolations of observed strain rate data in a Eurasia-fixed reference frame. Strain rate observations include India plate motion, velocities at 506 GPS stations, estimated Quaternary fault slip rates, and fault slip styles. We then calculate gravitational potential energy (GPE) using the Crust1.0 crustal thickness model and assuming Airy isostasy. Following the methods of Flesch et al. (2001), we then solve the depth averaged 3-D force balance equations to determine the vertically averaged deviatoric stress field associated with GPE. We next solve for stress field boundary conditions by minimizing the differences between a) the directions of deviatoric stress principal axes and strain rate principal axes, and b) the style of deformation predicted by the stress field and the style of deformation predicted by the strain rate field. These stress field boundary conditions are assumed to represent effects of plate motions.\nOur best-fit strain rate field shows regions of high strain rate along the Chaman Fault, Darvaz Fault, Zebak-Munjab Fault, Main Boundary Thrust, Main Pamir Thrust, boundaries of the western Tarim Basin and across the western Tien Shan. GPS data indicate strain along the Main Frontal Thrust. Our results confirm north-south compression and east-west extension in the central Pamir, as reported in Mohadjer et al. 2010. Despite high GPE/topography in the central Pamir and low GPE/topography in the adjacent Tarim Basin, the Pamir Mountains do not appear to collapse to the east, implying the presence of an additional process bolstering the eastern Pamir.\nThe strain rate and velocity fields produced in this study provide a detailed investigation into surface kinematics and dynamics in the Pamir and offer a first-order look at regions with increased vulnerability to seismic hazards.",

Indeed, NEC is the main contributor to Etna’s gas release, and continuously generates infrasonic events: a result of its impulsive degassing regime. Moreover, the opening of the EF offered a unique opportunity to investigate the partitioning of energy and geophysical signals between degassing, explosive and effusive sources.\nThe field campaign involved coupled deployment of seismometers, microphones, thermopiles, a mini-UV scanner, FTIR spectrometer, SO2 camera systems, high-speed video cameras, thermal and visible cameras, gravimeters, tiltmeters, drones, laser HCl sensor, Lidar and satellite data. Moreover, this experiment gave the opportunity to test the prototype of a DIAL for volcanic CO2 sensing the first time in a volcanic environment. Gathered information were integrated with data simultaneously recorded by the permanent networks run by Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia.\nPreliminary analyses show a promising return, which we hope will shed new light on the complex interplay between degassing and eruptive dynamics. Our objective is to contribute to a better understanding of the eruptive and degassing mechanisms, as well as the structure of Etna’s upper plumbing system.",

However, full treatment of RT processes is computationally expensive, prompting usage of 2-stream approximations in operational climate models. This simplification introduces errors of the order of 10% in the top of the atmosphere (TOA) fluxes [Randles et al., 2013].\nNatraj et al. [2005, 2010] and Spurr and Natraj [2013] demonstrated the ability of a technique using principal component analysis (PCA) to speed up RT simulations. In the PCA method for RT performance enhancement, empirical orthogonal functions are developed for binned sets of inherent optical properties that possess some redundancy; costly multiple-scattering RT calculations are only done for those (few) optical states corresponding to the most important principal components, and correction factors are applied to approximate radiation fields.\nHere, we extend the PCA method to a broadband spectral region from the ultraviolet to the shortwave infrared (0.3-3 micron), accounting for major gas absorptions in this region. Comparisons between the new model, called Universal Principal Component Analysis model for Radiative Transfer (UPCART), 2-stream models (such as those used in climate applications) and line-by-line RT models are performed, in order for spectral radiances, spectral fluxes and broadband fluxes. Each of these are calculated at the TOA for several scenarios with varying aerosol types, extinction and scattering optical depth profiles, and solar and viewing geometries.\n\nWe demonstrate that very accurate radiative forcing estimates can be obtained, with better than 1% accuracy in all spectral regions and better than 0.1% in most cases as compared to an exact line-by-line RT model. The model is comparable in speeds to 2-stream models, potentially rendering UPCART useful for operational General Circulation Models (GCMs). The operational speed and accuracy of UPCART can be further improved by optimizing binning schemes and parallelizing the codes, work on which is under way.",

Traditional migration approaches require an approximation of the near-surface velocity field and proper modeling of elastic waves to estimate the Green's functions from the source and receiver positions to every image-point. With dense passive seismic array acquisition and ambient noise cross-correlations, each station can be considered as both a virtual source and a receiver and near-surface scatterers can be imaged across the array using only the empirical Green's functions. This new imaging approach is referred to as natural migration because the Green's functions needed for migration are naturally estimated from the crosscorrelograms of recorded traces. The advantages of natural migration are that it does not require estimation of the near-surface velocity or modeling of elastic waves. In addition, natural migration simultaneously images both low- and higher-order scattering and mode converted waves. The disadvantage is that the image resolution is dependent on the distribution of seismic receivers. To validate this concept, natural migration is applied to crosscorrelograms of passive data recorded by the Long Beach array and the USArray. The resulting migration images highlight known discontinuities from tomography and correlate to prominent geological boundaries at two very different scales: (1) tectonic scale such as the edge of the Atlantic Plain Province in southeastern US and (2) regional scale structure in Long Beach, California. The migration images can be used along with tomography methods to improve structure sharpness in a model construction.",

            "abstract": "Plate tectonics is thought to be a crucial ingredient of planetary habitability because it facillitates the operation of the long term carbon cycle, with its inherent stabilizing climate feedbacks, throughout geologic history. However, recent work in understanding the geodynamical causes of plate tectonics highlights the importance of a cool climate in allowing a plate tectonic, rather than a stagnant lid, mode of mantle convection to operate. Thus the climate and the mode of mantle convection (i.e. plate tectonic or stagnat lid) may be fully coupled. I present new work on the dynamics of such a fully coupled atmosphere-mantle system to assess the stability of the plate tectonic-cool climate state for varying planet size, total planetary carbon budget, and mantle temperature (which maps to planet age). I use a model that couples recently developed scaling laws for mantle convection with grain-damage, a grain size feedback mechanism for generating plate tectonic style mantle convection, with a simple carbon cycle box model and a 1-D radiative-convective atmosphere model. Steady-state models demonstrate that the negative climate feedbacks resulting from the long term carbon cycle are preserved, and possibly even enhanced, when the vigor of plate tectonics depends on surface temperature. Thus planets with temperate climates (e.g. those within the habitable zone) are more likely to have plate tectonics and to maintain their habitable climates over geologic time. A key question is then what the initial surface conditions of a planet are, and how they influence its subsequent evolution. In particular, if planets undergo a magma ocean phase, significant degassing from the solidifying mantle could lead to CO2 rich proto-atmospheres, which would inhibit plate-tectonics, and the recycling of carbon into the mantle via subduction. I focus on this case, with a CO2 rich proto-atmosphere, as it acts against the development of plate tectonics and a habitable climate. Using full evolution models of the coupled mantle-carbon cycle system I show the conditions necessary for a stable plate-tectonic-habitable climate state to develop, and the timescales for the evolution from a post-magma ocean, CO2 rich atmosphere, to a temperate climate. Finally, the implications of this work for planetary habitability are discussed.",

            "abstract": "The differences between earthquakes and explosions are largest in the highest recordable frequency band. In this band, scattering of elastic energy by small-scale heterogeneity (less than a wavelength) can equilibrate energy on components of motion and stabilize the behavior of the Lg wave trapped in the Earth's crust. Larger-scale deterministic structure (greater than a wavelength) can still assume major control over the efficiency or blockage of the Lg and other regional/local seismic waves. This project proposes to model the combined effects of the large- scale (deterministic) and the small scale (statistical) structure to invert for improved structural models and to evaluate the performance of yield estimators and discriminants at selected IMS monitoring stations in Eurasia. This will be accomplished by synthesizing seismograms using a radiative transport technique to predict the high frequency coda (>5 Hz) of regional seismic phases at stations having known large-scale three-dimensional structure, combined with experiments to estimate the effects of multiple-scattering from unknown small-scale structure.",

            "abstract": "Recently, a new approach of seismoelectric imaging has been proposed in which seismic waves are focused in the subsurface to scan its heterogeneous nature and determine saturation fronts. Such type of imaging requires a complete modeling of the seismoelectric properties of porous media saturated by two fluid phases, one being the wetting phase for the solid grains and one being the non-wetting phase (for instance water and oil). We combine an extension of the poroelastic modeling to two-phase flow conditions with an extension of the electrokinetic theory based on the notion of an effective charge per unit pore volume that can be dragged by the flow of each fluid phase. These effective charge densities can be related directly to the permeability. We used finite element approach to simulate the seismoelectric signals in the partially saturated condition to formulate a transfer equation connecting the macroscopic electrical field to the acceleration of the fast P-wave and to study the influence of the water content on the amplitude of the co-seismic waves. The amplitude of the co-seismic wave is very sensitive to the water content with an increase in the amplitude of the electro-coseismic wave with water saturation. We also investigate the seismoelectric conversions occurring at the water table and the absence of conversion below the irreducible water saturation. We show that the conversion response at the water table can be identifiable only when the saturation contrasts between the vadose and saturated zones is sharp. Then a relatively dry vadose zone represents the best condition to identify the ground water level through seismoelectric measurements especially because in this case, the co-seismic signal is very small compared to the seismoelectric conversion response.",

            "abstract": "Although wind turbine wake modeling is critical for accurate wind resource assessment, operational forecasting, and wind plant optimization, verification of such simulations is currently constrained by sparse datasets taken in limited atmospheric conditions, often of single turbines in isolation.\nTo address this knowledge gap, our team deployed a WINDCUBE 200S scanning lidar in a 300-MW operating wind farm as part of the CWEX-13 field experiment. The lidar was deployed ~2000 m from a row of four turbines, such that wakes from multiple turbines could be sampled with horizontal scans. Twenty minutes of every hour were devoted to horizontal scans at ½ degree resolution at six different elevation angles. Twenty-five days of data were collected, with wind speeds at hub height ranging from quiescent to 14 m/s, and atmospheric stability varying from unstable to strongly stable. The example scan in Fig. 1a shows wakes from a row of four turbines propagating to the northwest.\nThis extensive wake dataset is analyzed based on the quantitative approach of Aitken et al. (J. Atmos. Ocean. Technol. 2014), who developed an automated wake detection algorithm to characterize wind turbine wakes from scanning lidar data. We have extended the Aitken et al. (2014) method to consider multiple turbines in a single scan in order to classify the large numbers of wakes observed in the CWEX-13 dataset (Fig. 1b) during southerly flow conditions.\nThe presentation will explore the variability of wake characteristics such as the velocity deficit and the wake width. These characteristics vary with atmospheric stability, atmospheric turbulence, and inflow wind speed. We find that the strongest and most persistent wakes occur at low to moderate wind speeds (region 2 of the turbine power curve) in stable conditions. We also present evidence that, in stable conditions with strong changes of wind direction with height, wakes propagate in different directions at different elevations above the surface. Finally, we compare characteristics of wakes at the outside of the row of turbines to wakes from turbines in the interior of the row, quantifying how wakes from outer turbines erode faster than those from interior.",

            "abstract": "The Atlantic Ocean meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) contributes to moderate of climate in Europe through the northward transport of 25% of the global heat flux, which is at maximum at around 24.50ºN. Consequently, transatlantic oceanographic sections at this latitude have become a benchmark for monitoring long-term changes in the Atlantic and to study the nature and causes of climate change. This has resulted in the occupation of the North Atlantic Ocean hydrographic transect along 24.5ºN seven times since 1957, more than any other transoceanic section in the world. The east-west slope in the dynamic height at 200dbar referenced to 1800dbar along 24.5ºN has decreased in 12-cm between 1957 and 2011, suggesting a spin-down of the central-North Atlantic subtropical gyre. Over imposed on this long-term trend in the slope there is a decadal variability in the slope with amplitudes up to 5 cm, that persist for several years, as the one during 2001-2004 that preceded large compensated changes in temperature and salinity at 24.5ºN. The hydrographic dataset show that this signal is predominantly due to vertical motion of the isopycnal surfaces, extending to depths of at least 1800 dbar. Using the linearized equations for a stratified ocean separated into vertical modes and for low-frequency, large-scale wind forcing, we explore the role of westward propagating linear Rossby waves in explaining these long-term and decadal changes. The results indicate the long-term change may be explained by the differential trend of wind stress curl between the eastern and western basins. The results are compared with simulations from a two-layer primitive equation model with realistic topography. Given the recent interests in Rossby waves, as the main mechanism explaining the observed seasonal cycle of the AMOC, an analysis of the impact of the seasonal variability induced by Rossby waves at 24.5ºN is also carried out.",

As these metallic species are ionized during ablation, by sunlight’s ultraviolet photons, or by charge exchange with existing atmospheric ions, meteoroids affect the structure, chemistry, dynamics, and energetics of the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere (MLT). The strong optical signals that some of these metal layers produce, in particular the Na layer, makes them an optimal tracer of atmospheric dynamics and circulation and enabling the measurement of quantities, such as composition, temperature and winds, that are critical to address several compelling scientific questions related to the Earth's Upper Atmosphere and the Geospace Environment. In recent years, remote-sensing satellites have obtained the first global characterization of the basic structure of the MLT region in terms of large-scale temperature and wind climatologies, resulting in a much richer picture of the structure and variability of the mesosphere. Although these measurements have shown the high temporal variability of both the zonal mean state as well as large scale organized perturbations, such as planetary waves and atmospheric tides, they failed at providing information required for the fundamental characterization of how the basic state is established and maintained. Thus there is a pressing need in the Ionosphere-Thermosphere-Mesosphere (ITM) community to be able to perform high-resolution measurements that can be used to characterize the small-scale variability in the MLT on a global basis. Such measurements must include highly resolved, in space and time, global temperatures profiles, which will add to the understanding of key indicators of radiative cooling in the mesosphere. We present in this paper initial efforts to develop and demonstrate an integrated ground-based operational sodium lidar science instrument using key “space-flight-precursor” components. In this way, a ground-based Na lidar will demonstrate the spaceflight instrument viability in a cost-efficient approach and will serve as the core for the future planning of a Heliophysics space mission.",

Coding on the QAC is not straightforward: a problem must be posed as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and mapped to a spherical Chimera graph.\nWe have developed a method for compiling nonlinear 4D-Var problems on the D-Wave that consists of five steps:\nEmulating the nonlinear model and/or observation function using radial basis functions (RBF) or Chebyshev polynomials.\nTruncating a Taylor series around each RBF kernel.\nReducing the Taylor polynomial to a quadratic using ancilla gadgets.\nMapping the real-valued quadratic to a fixed-precision binary quadratic.\nMapping the fully coupled binary quadratic to a partially coupled spherical Chimera graph using ancilla gadgets.\nAt present the D-Wave contains 512 qbits (with 1024 and 2048 qbit machines due in the next two years); this machine size allows us to estimate only 3 state variables at each satellite overpass.

            "abstract": "We propose a method to determine focal mechanisms of non-volcanic tremors (NVTs) based on S-wave polarization angles. The successful retrieval of polarization angles in low S/N tremor signals owes much to the observation that NVTs propagate slowly and therefore they do not change their location immediately. This feature of NVTs enables us to use a longer window to compute a polarization angle (e.g., one minute or longer), resulting in a stack of particle motions. Following Zhang and Schwartz (1994), we first correct for the splitting effect to recover the source polarization angle (anisotropy-corrected angle). This is a key step, because shear-wave splitting distorts the particle motion excited by a seismic source. We then determine the best double-couple solution using anisotropy-corrected angles of multiple stations. The present method was applied to a tremor sequence at Kii Peninsula, southwest Japan, which occurred at the beginning of April 2013. A standard splitting and polarization analysis were subject to a one-minute-long moving window to determine the splitting parameters as well as anisotropy-corrected angles. A grid search approach was performed at each hour to determine the best double-couple solution satisfying one-hour average polarization angles. Most solutions show NW-dipping low-angle planes consistent with the plate boundary or SE-dipping high-angle planes. Because of 180 degrees ambiguity in polarization angles, the present method alone cannot distinguish compressional quadrant from dilatational one. Together with the observation of very low-frequency earthquakes near the present study area (Ito et al., 2007), it is reasonable to consider that they represent shear slip on low-angle thrust faults. It is also noted that some of solutions contain strike-slip component.\nAcknowledgements: Seismograph stations used in this study include permanent stations operated by NIED (Hi-net), JMA, Earthquake Research Institute, together with Geological Survey of Japan, AIST.

West of the Alpine Fault the Australian crust above the slab has been incorporated into the collisional plate boundary and uplifted in a compressional belt up to 100 km wide.\nRetro-deformation and back-stripping of 10 regional transects utilising surface geology, seismic reflection lines and exploration wells define the progressive deformation of the Australian crust since 35 Ma along the collisional margin. The reconstructed geometry of faulted basement blocks is tied to localisation and evolution of overlying sedimentary basins, coeval with displacement on the Alpine Fault. Amounts of shortening, uplift and subsidence and fault activity are heterogeneous in space and time across the margin, and are controlled by compressional reactivation of inherited high-angle, N-S Paleogene normal faults oblique to the margin. However, significant differences also occur along the strike of the collisional margin, with major contrasts in uplift and subsidence north and south of lat. 41°.7, i.e. the region overlying the southern termination of the Hikurangi slab. These differences are highlighted by present day hydrographic anomalies in the Buller region, and by the pattern of filtered topography at > 75 km wavelength.\nOur data show that the 3D geometry of the Australian plate cannot be entirely attributed to inherited crustal heterogeneity of a flexured “retro-foreland” domain in the footwall of the Alpine Fault, and suggest the need of deeper dynamic interaction between the Pacific and Australian lithosphere along the subduction-collision margin.",

            "abstract": "Environmental monitoring projects on the grounds of a campus can serve as data collection sites for undergraduate research. Penn State Brandywine has utilized students in independent study projects to establish two citizen science programs and to begin collecting data, with the data sets serving as a foundation for authentic inquiry-based exercises in introductory-level Earth science courses. The first citizen science program is The Smithsonian Institution's Global Tree Banding Project, which contributes to research about tree biomass by tracking how trees respond to climate. We are going beyond the requirements of the Smithsonian project. Instead of only taking two measurements each in the spring and fall, undergraduate researchers are taking measurements every two weeks throughout the year. We started taking measurements of ten trees on campus in 2012 will continue until each tree outgrows its tree band. The data is available for download in Google Spreadsheets for students to examine changes in tree diameter within one or between growing seasons, supplemented with temperature and precipitation data (see\nhttp://sites.psu.edu/treebanding/\n). A second citizen science program we have begun on campus is the NASA-funded Digital Earth Watch (DEW) Picture Post Project, allowing students to monitor the environment and share observations through digital photography. We established four Picture Post sites on campus, with students taking weekly photos to establish an environmental baseline of the campus landscape and to document future environmental changes pre- and post-construction. We started taking digital photos on campus in 2014 will continue well past the completion of construction to continue to look for changes. The image database is less than a year old, but the images provide enough information for some early analyses, such as the variations in “greenness” over the seasons. We have created a website that shares the purpose of our participation in the Picture Post Project and links to our images (see\nhttp://sites.psu.edu/picturepost/\n). Having these citizen science programs on campus provides students a greater connection to their local environment, the opportunity to work with data collected by and for students, and the ability to contribute the data to a global database and research program.",

            "abstract": "Wastewater discharged through ocean outfalls can surface near coastlines and beaches, posing a threat to the marine environment and human health. Coastal waters of the Southern California Bight (SCB) are an ecologically important marine habitat and a valuable resource in terms of commercial fishing and recreation. Two of the largest wastewater treatment plants along the U.S. West Coast discharge into the SCB, including the Hyperion Wastewater Treatment Plant (HWTP) and the Orange County Sanitation District (OCSD). In 2006, HWTP conducted an internal inspection of its primary 8 km outfall pipe (60 m depth), diverting treated effluent to a shorter 1.2 km pipe (18 m depth) from Nov. 28 to Nov. 30. From Sep. 11 – Oct. 4, 2012, OCSD conducted a similar diversion, diverting effluent from their 7 km outfall pipe to a shallower 2.2 km pipe, both with similar depths to HWTP. Prevailing oceanographic conditions in the SCB, such as temporally reduced stratification and surface circulation patterns, increased the risk of effluent being discharged from these shorter and shallower pipes surfacing and moving onshore. The aim of this study was to evaluate the capabilities of satellite remote sensing data (i.e., sea surface roughness from SAR, sea surface temperature from MODIS-Aqua and ASTER-Terra, chlorophyll-a and water leaving radiance from MODIS-Aqua) in the identification and tracking of wastewater plumes during the 2006 HWTP and 2012 OCSD diversion events. Satellite observations were combined with in situ, wind, and current data taken during the diversion events, to validate remote sensing techniques and gain surface to subsurface context of the nearshore diversion events. Overall, it was found that satellite remote sensing data were able to detect surfaced wastewater plumes along the coast, providing key spatial information that could inform in situ field sampling during future diversion events, such as the planned 2015 HWTP diversion, and thereby constrain costs.",

            "abstract": "A large-scale analysis of landfalling atmospheric rivers (ARs) is performed for the extended winter (November through March) for the last thirty years using MERRA reanalysis. Over the North Pacific, the climatology and upper-level characteristics of approximately 750 ARs are presented based on the 85th percentile of peak daily moisture flux and compared to an extreme subset of events selected based on the 95thpercentile of peak daily moisture flux and precipitation total. In composites of upper level fields during AR occurrences, certain characteristics stand out irrespective of the tropical climate indices, suggesting the key role of extratropical dynamical processes in AR development.\nComposites of dynamical fields following the eastward progression of ARs show a close relationship between the location of the jet, Rossby wave propagation and anticyclonic Rossby wave breaking in the upper troposphere of the east Pacific and moisture transport in the lower troposphere (see attached figure). Comparison between the strongest and the weakest ARs show differences in both the intensity of moisture transport and the scale and development of anticyclonic Rossby wave breaking in the east Pacific.\nTo characterize shifts in AR behavior within the context of projected changes at the end of the century, we extend this line of work using data from 15 different models that participated in CMIP5 and compare our climatology, based on MERRA reanalysis, to daily historical model data (1980 – 2000) and RCP 8.5 (2080 – 2100) projection data. We examine how well ARs are represented in the model output and investigate, within a dynamical context, the role of warming in modifying AR intensity, landfalling latitude and precipitation distribution. We show that while intensity increases are nearly uniform across the models, precipitation and landfalling latitude are quite variable. Here, we focus on the dynamical factors leading to this variability.",

            "abstract": "Impoundment of the Zipingpu Reservoir (ZR), China, began in September 2005 and culminated in a water depth averaging 100 meters. This impoundment was followed 2.7 years later by the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan Earthquake (WE), which ruptured the Longmen Shan Fault (LSF) with its epicenter about 12 kilometers away from the ZR. The close proximity of reservoir impoundment and the WE in both space and time suggests that the events are coupled. Previous studies, however, obtained inconclusive results. Based on the fully-coupled poroelastic theory, we employ three-dimensional Finite Element Models (FEMs) to simulate the evolution of stress and pore pressure due to reservoir impoundment, and its effect on the Coulomb stress on the LSF. The results indicate that the reservoir impoundment broke the regional balance of pore pressure, and formed a pore-pressure front that slowly propagated through the crust with fluid diffusion. Due to the diffusion of the pore pressure, the effective normal stress increased steadily, and so did the Coulomb stress change on LSF. The FEMs predict the positive Coulomb stress changes on the LSF propagating from the upper crust to lower crust. The reservoir loading had increased the Coulomb stress on the shallow part of the LSF up to tens to hundreds of kPa, significantly in favor of the failure of the LSF. It is still quite uncertain about the geometry and extent of the LSF at depth, we therefore calculate the Coulomb stress changes over a range of scenarios of hypocenter locations and fault dip angles. Our result shows that in most of the scenarios the Coulomb stress at the hypocenter either had no increase or increased moderately prior to the WE. However, the Coulomb stress grew significantly in the shallow to mid depth range of the LSF, which “advanced” the leveling of tectonic loading of the fault system for tens to hundreds of years. The initial slip of the WE might or might not be triggered by the impoundment of ZR; but a small event at the hypocenter could trigger large rupture on fault plane above, where the asperities were located. The micro-seismicity around the ZR also showed an expanding pattern from the ZR since its impoundment, which could be associated with diffusion of positive pore pressure. These results suggest a poroelastic triggering effect of the WE due to the impoundment of the ZR.",

            "abstract": "Based on the ratio of various trace-elements from coral cores, there is considerable evidence that the amount of sediment reaching the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, has increased since agricultural development commenced in the 1870’s. However, understanding the primary source and processes driving the increase in sediment delivery has been challenging due to the variable geology and episodic hydrology of adjacent catchments. This paper presents the results from several projects that use a range of measurement techniques all aimed at understanding the spatial and temporal changes in sediment yield from the Burdekin watershed, Australia. Cosmogenic nuclide analysis (10Be) was combined with contemporary sediment flux monitoring to help identify the high risk sub-watersheds. Particle size analysis of the sediment loads from the sub-watersheds has determined the primary source areas for the fine (clay) sediment fractions. Within the sub-watersheds, fallout radionuclides (137Cs, 7Pb and 7Be) showed that most of the fine sediment is coming from vertical channel walls (50%) or horizontal sub-surface soils (~42%). Changes to in-stream sedimentation rates, derived from OSL dating, suggest that sediment delivery to channels lags behind reductions to vegetative ground cover. Historical archives of remotely sensed ground cover data were then linked to animal stocking rates in the area. Together, these data sets help elucidate the often complex sediment delivery processes and provide a stronger link between grazing land management and sediment flux to the GBR. This study highlights the benefit of using a range of techniques and data sets to identify the major sediment sources in these highly variable systems. The implications for land management restoration, policy and investment are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Arsenic contamination of groundwater in Bangladesh affects millions of people, as groundwater is the primary source of both drinking and irrigation water in the country. The arsenic is of geologic origin, naturally-occurring in the aquifer sediment. However, the source of organic carbon that fuels the microbial reactions responsible for mobilizing arsenic off the sediment and into the groundwater has been debated for over a decade. The outstanding question is whether this organic carbon is sedimentary carbon that was co-deposited when the aquifers were formed, or surface-derived organic carbon transported into the subsurface along with recharge water. The answer to this question has implications for managing the contamination problem.\nHere we present results of recent laboratory incubations of aquifer sediment with recharge waters collected from our field site in Bangladesh. The incubations revealed a hitherto undocumented pool of biodegradable sedimentary organic carbon. Despite the carbon being old (thousands of years), it was rapidly utilized by the native microbial population. The results imply that within the aquifer this pool of sedimentary organic carbon is largely unavailable to the microbial community, but that chemical and/or physical perturbations to the subsurface, induced, for example, by large-scale groundwater pumping or microbial activity, could mobilize this bioavailable organic carbon off the sediment. Currently, we are using Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry and spectroscopic techniques to understand the initial character of the mobilized organic carbon in our incubation experiments, and to track how its composition changes over time as it is degraded by microbes. These efforts will help clarify the in situ processes that could destabilize the sedimentary organic carbon and identify the components that make the carbon biologically available. Collectively, our data suggest a possible role for both surface-derived and sedimentary organic carbon in fueling the microbial reactions that mobilize arsenic into groundwater: surface-derived carbon can stimulate microbial reactions that target the solid phase and destabilize bioavailable sedimentary organic carbon that can then fuel further microbial reactions (i.e., the “priming” hypothesis).",

            "abstract": "Food systems currently contribute up to one-third of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, and these emissions are expected to rise as demand for agricultural products increases. Thus, improving the greenhouse gas emissions efficiency of agriculture – the tons or kilocalories of production per ton of CO2 equivalent emissions – will be critical to support a resilient future global system. Here, we model and evaluate global, 2000-era, spatially explicit relationships between a suite of greenhouse gas emissions from various agronomic practices (i.e., fertilizer application, peatland draining, and rice cultivation) and crop yields. Then, we predict potential emissions from future crop production increases achieved through intensification and extensification, including CO2 emissions from croplands replacing non-urban land cover. We find that 2000-era yield-scaled agronomic emissions are highly heterogeneous across crops types, crop management practices, and regions. Rice agriculture produces more total CO2-equivalent emissions than any other crop. Moreover, inundated rice in just a few countries contributes the vast majority of these rice emissions. Crops such as sunflower and cotton have low efficiency on a caloric basis. Our results suggest that intensification tends to be a more efficient pathway to boost greenhouse gas emissions efficiency than expansion. We conclude by discussing potential crop- and region-specific agricultural development pathways that may boost the greenhouse gas emissions efficiency of agriculture.",

Studies of CH4 flux from Arctic wetlands have been growing in recent years, but few provide details on biogeochemical controls. Stable isotopic measurements help elucidate methane production and consumption pathways and offer important understanding about dynamics of CH4 cycling in Arctic systems. In order to demonstrate the possible instrumental approaches to measuring methane dynamics of wetlands in the Arctic, a fringing wetland of a small lake near the Russell Glacier in Southwestern Greenland was outfitted with static flux chambers and instrumented with a field-deployable Cavity Ring Down Spectrometer (CRDS) to measure real-time concentrations of CH4 and CO2 and their stable carbon isotopes. Several different wetland plant communities were included in the flux chamber experiments and field tests were conducted during several weeks in July 2014. Analytical measurements by CRDS were compared to batch samples analyzed in the laboratory using both Off-Axis Integrated Cavity Output Spectroscopy (ICOS) and Gas Chromatography-Combustion-Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS) with cryogenic pre-concentration. Results from flux chamber deployments will be presented and comparisons between the real-time field measurements and laboratory instrumental techniques will be evaluated.",

            "abstract": "Tephra recovered by deep-sea drilling from forearc to backarc across the Mariana volcanic arc system record the last 34 million years of the Arc’s evolution. Major and trace element abundances and Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotope ratios have been determined for tephra with high temporal precision and an average resolution of ∼1 million years. Temporal variations of source-sensitive radiogenic isotopes and large-ion lithophile elements (LILE) are decoupled from the steady trends of silica and other archetypical crust-forming major elements. Modeling confirms the temporal isotopic and elemental abundance trends are controlled by subducted slab and mantle sources. Pb and Sr fluxes can be linked to fluids from altered oceanic crust (AOC), Nd is influenced by contributions from the mantle wedge and partial slab melts, while Hf mostly derives from the subarc mantle. Most plausibly, the K2O increase and fluctuations thereafter can be linked to a collision of the Mariana Arc with the leading trace of the Cretaceous-aged Western Pacific Seamount Province. The Province is inferred to have arrived at the Mariana Trench at ∼15-16 Ma coincident with the termination of spreading in the Parece Vela Backarc Basin. A short period of slab melting followed, possibly induced by slab rollback that peaked at ∼8-9 Ma and ended with the incipient rifting in the Mariana Trough at ∼7 Ma. Individual periods of Arc formation (52-24, 22-11, and 10-0 Ma) are characterized by a distinctive melee of source materials which is not repeated through time. Mariana Arc crustal growth has occurred through the addition of predominantly mafic and silicic melts formed during relatively short time intervals traceable via the chemically-distinctive subducted slab inputs.",

            "abstract": "The NASA Orbiting Carbon Observatory – 2 (OCO-2) was successfully launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base at 9:56:44 UTC on July 2, 2014. After a series of spacecraft checkout activities and orbit raising maneuvers, OCO-2 was inserted at the front of the 705-km Afternoon constellation (A-Train) on August 3rd. This presentation will summarize the science objectives, review the measurement approach, and introduce some preliminary data from the first few months of operation.\nOCO-2 was designed to return estimates of the column-averaged atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) dry air mole fraction (XCO2) with the precision, resolution, and coverage needed to quantify CO2 surface fluxes on regional scales. To meet these goals, it carries and points a 3-channel grating spectrometer that collects high resolution, co-bore-sighted spectra of reflected sunlight in the 765 nm O2 A-band and in the CO2 bands centered near 1610 and 2060 nm. Each channel records 24 spectra per second along a narrow (< 0.8-degree) track, returning about one million soundings each day. At least 10% of these soundings are expected to be sufficiently cloud free to yield full-column estimates of XCO2with single-sounding accuracies of 0.25 % on regional scales at monthly intervals.\nThe instrument is calibrated using on-board sources and targets, the Moon, well-characterized surface sites (Pollock et al. this session), and comparisons with nearly-coincident observations from the Japanese Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT; Kuze et al. this session). Cloudy soundings are identified and screened out (Taylor et al. this session) and the remaining soundings are analyzed to yield spatially-resolved estimates of XCO2 and other geophysical products (c.f. Frankenberg et al. this session). OCO-2 XCO2 estimates are then validated against those from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) to assess their accuracy and precision (Wennberg et al. this session). Preliminary products from each step of this process will be introduced here.\nBefore the end of 2014, the OCO-2 project will start delivering calibrated radiance spectra to the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) for distribution to the science community. Estimates of XCO2 will start being delivered to the GES DISC during the first quarter of 2015.",

            "abstract": "Change factor methodology (CFM), or delta change factor methodology, is a type of pattern scaling. Although a variety of methods are available to develop scenarios, CFMs are widely used for their ease and speed of application and their capability to directly scale local data according to changes suggested by the global climate model (GCM) scenarios. Change factors (CFs) can be calculated and used in a number of ways to estimate future climate scenarios, but no clear guidelines are available in the literature to decide which methodologies are most suitable for different applications. This study compares and contrasts several categories of CFM (additive versus multiplicative and single versus multiple) for a number of climate variables. The study employs several theoretical examples as well as an applied study from the New York City water supply. Results show that in cases where the frequency distribution of the GCM baseline climate is close to the frequency distribution of the observed climate, or when the frequency distribution of the GCM future climate is close to the frequency distribution of the GCM baseline climate, additive and multiplicative single CFMs provide comparable results. Two options to guide the choice of CFM are suggested: the first is a detailed methodological analysis for choosing the most appropriate CFM, and the second is a default method for circumstances in which a detailed methodological analysis is too cumbersome.",

            "abstract": "Array measurements of seismic noise (microseisms) are emerging as independent observables that inform our knowledge of ocean storms. Using an improved implementation of IAS Capon analysis, we can infer the location and amplitude of multiple sources of seismic noise over multiple decades. For the Southern Ocean, we can use seismic records to assist in identifying shifting patterns of ocean storms. Thus we can investigate topics such as the disparity between wave height trends identified using calibrated satellite records, which appear to be in increasing over multiple decades, and wave heights measured directly using a wave-rider buoy, which does not show a significant change over the same time frame. The passage of wave energy from the water column to the solid Earth, and through the 3D Earth to the seismic array must be tracked effectively.\nIn this contribution, we focus on understanding the passage of seismic noise through the 3D Earth. In particular, we investigate path deviations from 1D Earth models for body waves sources from a variety of locations in the Southern Ocean recorded at Australian seismic arrays. We also investigate path deviations of surface waves travelling across the Australian continent, using the AusREM Earth model. We also appraise other factors affecting the interpretation of slowness, backazimuth and amplitude from seismic array records. These include the effect of the bathymetry-related transfer function controlling energy entering the solid Earth from the water column and the impact of local geology at the site of the seismic array. For a season of storms in the southern hemisphere winter, we simulate the path of energy from a representative range of locations to Australia seismic arrays. We employ a wavefront tracking technique, fast marching, that can support heterogeneous structure and the consideration of multiple arrivals.\nWe find that storms in some locations are subject to a much larger deviation from the expected path of energy through a 1D Earth. We also find that, given the extended source characteristics of ocean storms, focusing and defocusing effects have a significant impact on the pattern of seismic noise observed at a given array. The interplay between these multiple factors results in 'sweet spots': locations in the ocean where storms are very well observed for a particular array.",

            "abstract": "This presentation is all about inexpensive ways of teaching uncertainty and mineral exploration drilling in the classroom. These labs were developed as an off-shoot of my years of mineral industry experience before I transitioned to geoscience education. I have developed several classroom lab exercises that relate to the role of modeling, uncertainty and prediction in mineral exploration. These lessons are mostly less expensive ($<5/group) hands-on activities that can be differentiated across grade levels. Early in the semester, modeling is explored through the cube and toilet paper roll puzzle lab. This is then immediately followed by the penny experiment that gives a physical meaning to the concept of uncertainty. However, it is the end-of-semester shoebox drilling lab that serves as the culminating activity for modeling, uncertainty and prediction. An object (orebody) is hidden inside a shoebox and the students are challenged to design a drilling program to predict the location and topology of a “mineral deposit”. The students’ decision on the location of the first few drill holes will be based on how they analyze, synthesize and evaluate simple surface topographic, geologic and geochemical +/- geophysical data overlain on top of the box. Before drilling, students are required to construct several geologic sections that will “model” the shape of the hidden orebody. Using bamboo skewers as their drilling equipment, students then commence their drilling and along the way learn the importance of drill spacing in decreasing uncertainty or increasing confidence. Lastly, the mineral separation lab gives them an opportunity to design another experiment that mimics mineral processing and learns a valuable lesson on the difficulties in recovery and how it relates to entropy (no such thing as 100% recoverability). The last two labs can be further enhanced with economic analysis through incorporation of drilling and processing costs. Students further appreciate the world of of mineral exploration with several YouTube videos on the use of 3D and 4D GIS mine modeling softwares. However at the same time, I forewarn them about the dangers on the dependence to these visually attractive computer-generated products without field verification or the fidelity to the ground-based and drillcore-based observations.",

The migrated image along a profile above the flat subduction is shown in the figure, overlain by the receiver functions of one well-recorded event. We see that the slab descends to 100 km depth at a distance of about 100 km inland from the coast, and then it rises to 90 km depth and remains flat for the next 300 km distance before diving into the mantle. The Moho itself has about 10 km relief above the flat slab, which is anti-correlated with the surface topography indicating Airy compensation. Interestingly, the flat slab image is missing under this part of Moho. The mid-crust structure is also evident. In the west, it coincides with the Andean Low Velocity Zone (ALVZ) mapped in this region (Ma and Clayton, 2014). In the east, it is related with the underthrusting Brazilian Shield (Phillips and Clayton, 2014). In this paper, we further investigate the causes of the missing or weak flat slab signal, possibly due to anomalous attenuation of S waves in the mantle wedge (but not P wave, since Moho is well imaged). We will also extend our study to the flat-normal transition area beneath the array.",

            "abstract": "In 2016-17, Juno and Cassini Proximal will provide comparable large advances in our understanding of the interiors of Jupiter and Saturn. Both will provide high accuracy gravity and magnetic field data, while Juno will in addition determine the water abundance deep in the Jovian atmosphere, essential for understanding of giant planet formation and the density of the outer envelope (needed to construct interior models). Although Jupiter and Saturn are both gas giants, they differ in important ways (magnetic field, strength of zonal flows, enrichment in heavy elements, and probably the distribution of helium within). The opportunity to contrast and compare will be invaluable. Juno and Cassini are expected to determine the gravity field to about a part in 109 though with different spatial coverage and with less accurate determination near the poles. The determination of Jupiter’s likely central concentration of heavy elements is particularly challenging because it is only a few percent at most of the total mass and yet important for understanding Jupiter’s formation, which in turn likely determined the architecture of our solar system. This determination will be done from gravity, water determination and magnetic field and also aided by advances in our understanding of material properties. The corresponding determination for Saturn may prove easier (because the heavy element enrichment is a larger fraction of the mass) though complicated by lack of knowledge of water abundance and the need to identify a more precise value for the deep rotation of the planet (difficult for Saturn because of the lack of a measurable magnetic dipole tilt thus far). For both planets, the higher harmonics of gravity will likely be controlled by differential rotation (the zonal flows) and this will tell us their depth, an issue of major interest in the dynamics of these bodies. The magnetic field structure for Jupiter will be determined to higher accuracy than the Earth’s core field (since Jupiter lacks the terrestrial crustal contamination and the dynamo region extends closer to the surface) and this will be invaluable for understanding dynamos and internal dynamics. Comparison to Saturn will perhaps explain the striking difference between the magnetic fields of the two planets.",

            "abstract": "Solar radiation is a key component of the energy balance used for estimating evaporation. As solar radiation is not widely measured, many empirical models have been developed to estimate solar radiation using sunshine hours (SSH) data. Most of these models only provide deterministic estimates of monthly solar radiation and do not provide an estimate of the uncertainty in the predictions. This study developed five stochastic models which use daily SSH data to produce probabilistic simulations of solar radiation, and can be used to estimate historical daily radiation. The predictive uncertainty due to the timing of the SSH during the day (estimated using Monte Carlo simulation), as well as due to external errors (such as the variability in cloud type and atmospheric composition), were considered. The developed models differ in their parameterisation of the direct and diffuse components of the solar radiation, using either no scaling, linear or quadratic scaling of the radiation by the daily SSH fraction to account for cloud attenuation. For each model the simulated solar radiation was compared with the observed radiation. The performance of the five models was compared and the models were found to perform similarly well, with an average error of approximately 9% for all locations studied. The results suggest that the uncertainty due to the timing of the SSH does not dominate predictive errors in global radiation. Rather the external uncertainty is the dominant source of predictive error in the radiation estimates.",

            "abstract": "Humans have hardened land-water boundaries in almost every delta they live on. Engineering includes stabilizing and embanking channels to protect from river floods, building dikes around islands and emerging bars to reclaim land, and putting up sea walls to protect from waves and storm surges. These measures aim to reduce the exchange of water and sediment between the distributary delta channel network and the adjacent deltaplain. To first order, armoring of deltas results in net elevation loss of the floodplain, due to subsidence, compaction and reduced aggradation. Here, we ask what are the mechanisms of aggradation in ‘armored’ deltas? How do aggradation patterns compare to more natural depositional patterns?\nWe analyze 2-week period aggregates of MODIS satellite data from 2000 onwards to map inundation patterns due to irrigation, river floods and storm surges for selected deltas. Using a MODIS band-ratio, we assess relative concentrations of suspended sediment in stagnant water on the floodplains.\nIn addition, we use a simple approach to route sediment through the delta distributary network based on the relative channel geometries. A depositional process model then calculates cross-channel sediment flux as an exponential decay function, and determines sediment deposition over inundated areas.\nStacked inundation maps show vast areas of deltaplains have flooded between 2000-2014, despite armoring channels with dikes, and coastlines with seawalls. Flooding is caused by overtopping of levees and more rarely by breaching and in those latter cases the flooded areas are often locally constrained. In Asian deltas, rice paddy irrigation with floodwater can be mapped even in the more distal floodplain. Our model predicts that inundated areas still receive significant amounts of fresh sediment, but that the pattern is more variable than in natural systems. Sparse in-situ observations of floodplain aggradation rates and storm surge deposits corroborate high, but localized sedimentation rates.",

            "abstract": "Demory et al (2013) recently showed that the global water cycle in climate models, including the magnitude of water vapor transport, is strongly influenced by the model’s spatial resolution. The lack of offshore observations is noted as a serious limitation in determining the correct amount of transport. Due to the key role of atmospheric rivers (ARs) in determining the global distribution of water vapor, quantifying transport from ARs is a high priority. This forms a foundation of the CalWater-2 experiment aimed at sampling many ARs during 2014–2018.\nIn February 2014, an “early-start” deployment of the NOAA G-IV research aircraft sampled 10 ARs over the northeast Pacific Ocean. On six of these flights, dropsondes were deployed in a line crossing the AR so as to robustly sample the total water vapor transport (TVT). The TVT is defined here as the sum of the vertically integrated horizontal water vapor transport (IVT) in the AR using a baseline that stretches from its warm southern (or eastern) edge to its cool northern (or western) edge. TVT includes both AR-parallel and AR-perpendicular transport. These data double the overall number of such cross-AR airborne samples suitable for calculating TVT. Analysis of TVT for these six new samples, in combination with the six previous samples from the preceding 16 years (from CalJet, WISPAR, and a Hawaii-based campaign), will be shown. A comparison will be made of the AR width and TVT determined using the well-established integrated water vapor (IWV) threshold of 2 cm, versus an IVT threshold of 250 kg m-1 s-1.\nFinally, the data from a well sampled case on 13 February 2014 (23 sondes with 75-100 km spacing) will be used to assess the sensitivity of TVT to dropsonde horizontal spacing and vertical resolution. This sensitivity analysis is of practical importance for the upcoming CalWater-2 field campaign where the G-IV will be used to sample many additional AR events, due to the relatively high cost of the dropsondes.",

In general, zonally averaged CO2 from the three satellite data sets are consistent with the surface and TCCON XCO2 data. Retrievals of CO2 from the three satellites show more (less) CO2 in the northern hemisphere than that in the southern hemisphere in the northern hemispheric winter (summer) season. The difference between the three satellite CO2 retrievals might be related to the different averaging kernels in the satellites CO2 retrievals. A multiple regression method was used to calculate the CO2 annual cycle and semiannual cycle amplitudes from different satellite CO2 retrievals. The CO2 annual cycle and semiannual cycle amplitudes are largest at the surface, as seen in the NOAA-ESRL CO2 data sets. The CO2 annual cycle and semiannual cycle amplitudes in the GOSAT XCO2, AIRS mid-tropospheric CO2, and TES mid-tropospheric CO2 are smaller compared with those from the surface CO2. Similar regression analysis was applied to the Model for OZone And Related chemical Tracers-2 (MOZART-2) and CarbonTracker model CO2. The convolved model CO2 annual cycle and semiannual cycle amplitudes are similar to those from the satellite CO2 retrievals, although the model tends to under-estimate the CO2 seasonal cycle amplitudes in the northern hemisphere mid-latitudes from the comparison with GOSAT and TES CO2 and underestimate the CO2 semi-annual cycle amplitudes in the high latitudes from the comparison with AIRS CO2. The difference between model and satellite CO2 can be used to identify possible deficiency in the model and improve the model in the future.",

            "abstract": "Volcano monitoring is usually undertaken with the collection of both automated and manual data that form a multi-parameter time-series having a wide range of sampling rates and measurement accuracies. Assessments of hazards and risks ultimately rely on incorporating this information into usable form, first for the scientists to interpret, and then for the public and relevant stakeholders. One important challenge is in building appropriate and efficient strategies to compare and interpret data from these exceptionally different datasets.\nThe White Island volcanic system entered a new eruptive state beginning in mid-2012 and continuing through the present time. Eruptive activity during this period comprised small phreatic and phreato-magmatic events in August 2012, August 2013 and October 2013 and the intrusion of a small dome that was first observed in November 2012. We examine the chemical and geophysical dataset to assess the effects of small magma batches on the shallow hydrothermal system. The analysis incorporates high data rate (100 Hz) seismic, and infrasound data, lower data rate (1 Hz to 5 min sampling interval) GPS, tilt-meter, and gravity data and very low data rate geochemical time series (sampling intervals from days to months). The analysis is further informed by visual observations of lake level changes, geysering activity through crater lake vents, and changes in fumarolic discharges.\nWe first focus on the problems of incorporating the range of observables into coherent time frame dependant conceptual models. We then show examples where high data rate information may be improved through new processing methods and where low data rate information may be collected more frequently without loss of fidelity. By this approach we hope to improve the accuracy and efficiency of interpretations of volcano unrest and thereby improve hazard assessments.",

            "abstract": "Several authors have warned that climate scientists sometimes exhibit a tendency to “err on the side of least drama” in reporting the risks associated with fossil fuel emissions. Scientists are often reluctant to comment on the implications of their work for public policy, despite the fact that because of their expertise they may be among those best placed to make recommendations about such matters as mitigation and preparedness. Scientists often have little or no training in ethics or philosophy, and consequently they may feel that they lack clear guidelines for balancing the imperative to avoid error against the need to speak out when it may be ethically required to do so. This dilemma becomes acute in cases such as abrupt ice sheet collapse where it is easier to identify a risk than to assess its probability. We will argue that long-established codes of ethics in the learned professions such as medicine and engineering offer a model that can guide research scientists in cases like this, and we suggest that ethical training could be regularly incorporated into graduate curricula in fields such as climate science and geology. We recognize that there are disanalogies between professional and scientific ethics, the most important of which is that codes of ethics are typically written into the laws that govern licensed professions such as engineering. Presently, no one can legally compel a research scientist to be ethical, although legal precedent may evolve such that scientists are increasingly expected to communicate their knowledge of risks. We will show that the principles of professional ethics can be readily adapted to define an ethical code that could be voluntarily adopted by scientists who seek clearer guidelines in an era of rapid climate change.",

            "abstract": "Studies of the response of global climate to anthropogenic activities rely upon scenarios for future human activity to provide a range of possible trajectories for greenhouse gases emissions over the coming century. Sophisticated integrated models are used to explore not only what will happen, but what should happen in order to optimize societal well-being. Hundreds of equations might be used to account for the interplay between human decisions, technological change, and macroeconomic priniciples.\nIn contrast, the model equations used to describe geophysical phenomena look very different because they are a) purely deterministic and b) consistent with basic thermodynamic laws. This inconsistency between macroeconomics and physics suggests a rather unhappy marriage. During the Anthropocene the evolution of humanity and our environment will become increasingly intertwined. Representing such a coupling suggests a need for a common theoretical basis.\nTo this end, the approach that is described here is to treat civilization like any other physical process, that is as an open, non-equilibrium thermodynamic system that dissipates energy and diffuses matter in order to sustain existing circulations and to further its material growth. Theoretical arguments and over 40 years of measurements show that a very general representation of global economic wealth (not GDP) has been tied to rates of global primary energy consumption through a constant 7.1 ± 0.1 mW per year 2005 USD. This link between physics and economics leads to very simple expressions for how fast civilization and its rate of energy consumption grow. These are expressible as a function of rates of energy and material resource discovery and depletion, and of the magnitude of externally imposed decay. The equations are validated through hindcasts that show, for example, that economic conditions in the 1950s can be invoked to make remarkably accurate forecasts of present rates of global GDP growth and primary energy consumption. One implication for the future is that the unusually rapid growth that has been seen in past 60 years may predispose civilization to an equally rapid decline, especially should resource depletion and climate change start to take their toll.",

Recent studies have shown that magnetofossils are widespread in the geological record and that they carry useful environmental information and contribute to paleomagnetic recording. Thus, it is essential to quantify how these biogenic components contribute to the magnetic properties of sediments. We present results from several sedimentary sequences whose magnetic mineral assemblages contain a significant magnetofossil contribution. Using principal component analysis, we find that the central ridge properties exhibit both intra- and inter-sequence variability that may be ascribed to external environmental factors. While samples from individual sediment sequences tend to cluster together, there is a continuum of inter-sequence behavior that appears to be related to a variety of magnetofossil properties. We demonstrate the complexity of biogenic magnetic components in sedimentary environments, but also illustrate the potential of FORC central ridges for understanding magnetic mixtures and unraveling environmental information.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, a number of studies have shown that submarine groundwater discharge is an alternative nutrient pathway and can drive primary production in coastal seas. However, very little is known about an exact relationship between input of groundwater and response of primary production. To clarify the relationship, we conducted the field survey in the semi-enclosed coastal bay in Japan (Obama Bay). There are abundant amounts of groundwater resources in the basin. Firstly, we conducted 222Rn continuous measurement along the coast in March 2013 to obtain the spatial difference of groundwater impact. As a result, 222Rn activity clearly showed that groundwater discharge concentrates in the western part of the bay head. We thus conducted in-situ measurements of primary productivity using stable 13C tracer method and environmental parameters (ex. 222Rn activity, light intensity, temperature and nutrient concentrations) at 6 stations within the western bay head in July and August 2013. Primary productivity within the western bay head changed from 11.0 to 49.5 µg C L-1 hr-1 in July and from 9.3 to 32.4 µg C L-1 hr-1 in August. Moreover, there was significant relationship between primary productivity and 222Rn concentration in both months. Although light intensity and water temperature were different in each station and month, concentrations of nutrients limited primary productivity. These results showed that nutrient supply from SGD would affect crucial impact on primary productivity in Obama Bay.",

Though the geomagnetic field of the past 5 myr has been extensively studied and small geometric variations are being refined (e.g., Johnson et al., 2008, GGG 9), the pre-Mesozoic geomagnetic field geometry remains unresolved and is suggested to have large, non-dipolar contributions (e.g. Kent and Smethurst, 1998, EPSL 160, 391-402). We address the paleo-morphology by looking at inclination versus paleolatitude histograms derived from numerical geodynamo simulations with spatially variable CMB heat flux, similar to the method used by Bloxham (2000, Nature 405, 63-65). We will be using homogeneous heat flux simulations as a standard and compare the results to those of a present day tomography and a reconstracted 200 Ma tomography CMB heat flux. By comparing the relative contribution of non-dipolar components to the dipole field, we find that strong CMB heat flux heterogeneity is necessary to create the large non-dipolar contributions inferred for the paleomagnetic field.",

            "abstract": "A practical scheme is proposed to introduce tides explicitly into ocean general circulation models (OGCM). In this scheme, barotropic linear response to the tidal forcing is calculated by the time differential equations modified for ocean tides, instead of the original barotropic equations of an OGCM. This allows usage of various parameterizations specified for tides, such as the self attraction / loading (SAL) effect and energy dissipation due to internal tides, without unintentional violation of the original dynamical balances in an OGCM. Meanwhile, secondary nonlinear effects of tides, e.g. excitation of internal tides and advection by tidal currents, are fully represented in the framework of the original OGCM equations. We incorporated this scheme into Meteorological Research Institute Community Ocean Model and executed some test experiments. Results of a low-resolution global model showed that the model can simulate both of the non-tidal circulations and precise tidal motion simultaneously. The ocean states are affected by tides in the model through active excitement of internal tides and tidal mixing. We also developed a high-resolution Japanese coastal model with our tide scheme, which is nested in the global model. The tidal heights in the coastal model are found to agree well with observation at some tide gauges along the Japanese coasts.",

These rocks record the closure of a paleo-Tethyan Triassic ocean that formerly separated Cathaysian and Gondwana components of Asia, now forming the northern and southern Qiangtang blocks. Eclogite is extensively recrystallized to high-P amphibolite and greenschist facies assemblages, formed during water ingression that accompanied terrane uplift. P-T pseudosections constructed in Na2O-CaO-FeO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-H2O-TiO2-O (NCKMASHTO) in the context of petrography and mineral chemistry provides the ability to recover a dynamic PT history for the eclogite facies assemblages. Prograde (S1) assemblages for the Gemu Co eclogite are predicted to have formed at P≈21.5 kbars and T≈505°C and involved garnet, glaucophane, omphacite, rutile, lawsonite and chlorite, based on garnet composition and inferred pseudomorphs after lawsonite. Peak (S2) assemblages of garnet, barroisite, omphacite, rutile, epidote and quartz reflect P≈15 kbars and T≈570°C. Based on textural relations, post-peak stages can be divided into epidote-amphibolite and greenschist facies. The geothermal gradient for the prograde S1 assemblage and the peak S2 assemblage is 7.1 and 11.5°C/km respectively.40Ar/39Ar geochronology of phengitic mica using step heating in recrystallized eclogite components and surrounding garnet-mica schist components both yield maximum ages ranging 230-220 Ma. The congruency in ages of the deeply subducted high-pressure eclogites to the surrounding garnet phengite schists indicate they were the most probable source of fluids to extensively recrystallize most of the high-pressure eclogite components in the high-pressure belt. The P-T history of the high-P rocks of the QMB records the deep subduction of paleo-Tethyan oceanic crust to depths of at least 75 km. Subduction ceased when the south Qiangtang block collided with the north Qiangtang block, resulting in exhumation of high-P rocks in central Qiangtang.",

            "abstract": "Hydrologic variability is a primary driver of wetland forest physiological function and structure. Spatial variations in forest composition co-occur with hydrologic variations, generally assumed to be due to differences in tolerance to flooding and drought. To develop a process-level understanding of water table effects on wetland tree function, we measured transpiration of dominant bottomland hardwood species and analyzed how transpiration responded to spatial and temporal water table variations. Sap flow was measured with Granier-style heat dissipation probes in twenty-six trees (Celtis laevigata and Quercus lyrata) at two sites in the White River floodplain in Arkansas, USA (July – October, 2013). Hydrology at one site is controlled by headwater flooding driven by precipitation events. The other site is controlled by Mississippi River backwater flooding, where artificial levees cause high flood levels with rapid recession. Both sites have alluvial clay soils. At the backwater site, the receding water table corresponded with a steady reduction in transpiration throughout the growing season, suggesting that precipitation recharge of soil moisture did not satisfy demands despite the humid climate. In contrast, at the headwater site, precipitation events repeatedly raised the water table, which were mirrored by increases in transpiration. These results suggest preferential uptake from the free water surface over more tightly bound soil water, and that subsurface flood subsidies enable a longer effective growing season. Despite divergent growth strategies between the two monitored species, differences among the temporal patterns of transpiration depended more on microtopographic position rather than species. Recharge events by precipitation provided greater benefit for trees in microtopographic lows compared to those on ridges, evident by relatively higher sapflow rates, during the groundwater recession limb. Despite the similar species composition between sites, seasonality of growth and water use differed with topography and hydrologic forcing. Therefore, local hydrology, with evapotranspiration being a primary efflux, appears to be driven by larger-scale variation in groundwater.",

Previously, the BCP has been considered to be a latent heat polynya formed by predominantly offshore winds resulting in sea-ice divergence. Recently, it has been suggested that the sea-ice production rate in the BCP is suppressed by warm Pacific- or Atlantic-origin waters distributed beneath the BCP (e.g. Itoh et al., 2012). In this study, we focus on the oceanographic conditions such as water mass distribution and ocean current structure beneath the BCP, which have not been fully documented. A mooring was deployed off Barrow, Alaska in the northeast Chukchi Sea (71.23°N, 157.65°W, water depth 55 m) from August 2009 to July 2010. During the freeze-up period from December to May, five BCP events occurred in the same manner; 1) dominant wind parallel to Barrow Canyon, with an offshore component near Barrow, 2) high sea-ice production followed by sudden cessation of ice growth, 3) upwelling of warm (>2 K above freezing point) and saline (>34) Atlantic Water (AW) beneath the BCP, 4) strong up-canyon flow (>100cm/s) associated with density fluctuations. A baroclinic current structure, established after the upwelling, resulted in enhanced vertical shear, promoting vertical mixing. The mixing event and open water formation occurred simultaneously, once sea-ice production had stopped. Thus, mixing events accompanied by ocean heat flux from AW into the surface layer were likely to form/maintain the open water area that is a sensible heat polynya. The transition from a latent to a sensible heat polynya was well reproduced by a pan-Arctic ice-ocean model (COCO). We propose that the BCP is a hybrid latent and sensible heat polynya, with both processes driven by the same offshore wind.",

            "abstract": "Global and regional land carbon storage has been significantly affected by increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate change. Based on fully coupled climate-carbon-cycle simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), we investigate sensitivities of land carbon storage to rising atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate change over the world and 21 regions during the 130 years. Overall, the simulations suggest that consistently spatial positive effects of the increasing CO2 concentrations on land carbon storage are expressed with a multi-model averaged value of 1.04PgC per ppm. The stronger positive values are mainly located in the broad areas of temperate and tropical forest, especially in Amazon basin and western Africa. However, large heterogeneity distributed for sensitivities of land carbon storage to climate change. Climate change causes decrease in land carbon storage in most tropics and the Southern Hemisphere. In these regions, decrease in soil moisture (MRSO) and enhanced drought somewhat contribute to such a decrease accompanied with rising temperature. Conversely, an increase in land carbon storage has been observed in high latitude and altitude regions (e.g., northern Asia and Tibet). The model simulations also suggest that global negative impacts of climate change on land carbon storage are predominantly attributed to decrease in land carbon storage in tropics. Although current warming can lead to an increase in land storage of high latitudes of Northern Hemisphere due to elevated vegetation growth, a risk of exacerbated future climate change may be induced due to release of carbon from tropics.\nFigure Captions\nFigure 1.

            "abstract": "The Siyom Valley section in eastern Arunachal Pradesh exposes an inverted metamorphic succession (Nandini & Thakur, 2011), metapelitic assemblages increasing in grade northwards from chlorite, through biotite, garnet-staurolite and kyanite-bearing schist to kyanite-sillimanite migmatite. Grade changes are mostly controlled by shallowly north, and northwest-dipping fault structures. Two textural stages of garnet growth can be identified in the ilmenite-bearing amphibolite facies rocks, staurolite having formed late in, or after, deformation responsible for the main penetrative foliation (S2). Kyanite and rutile inclusions in garnet indicate that their growth in migmatite preceded that of matrix sillimanite, ilmenite and cordierite, though unrecrystallized kyanite is also common in the feldspathic matrix. Preliminary data indicate the pronounced tectonic thinning of metasedimentary protoliths during exhumation, and the probability of a pronounced step in grade in the middle part of the river section. Similarities with sections in the Sikkim (Dasgupta et al., 2004) and western Arunachal Pradesh (Goswami et al., 2009) Himalaya reflect the lateral continuity of the south-vergent thrusts that controlled the exhumation of the high-grade rocks, with debate concerning the location and significance of the Main Central Thrust zone begging protolith and metamorphic age data.\nDasgupta, S.,Ganguly, J. & Neogi, S., 2004.

The data sets used in this study have been produced by the NARCliM (NSW/ACT Regional Climate Modelling) project which provides a dynamically downscaled climate dataset for South-East Australia at 10km resolution. NARCliM has used three configurations of the Weather Research Forecasting regional climate model and four different GCMs (MIROC-medres 3.2, ECHAM5, CGCM 3.1 and CSIRO mk3.0) from CMIP3 to perform twelve ensembles of simulations for current and future climates.\nThe validation has been performed in the Upper Hunter region of Australia which is a semi-arid to arid region 200 kilometres North-West of Sydney. The analysis used the time series of downscaled rainfall data and ground based measurements for selected climate stations within the study area. The initial testing of the gridded rainfall was focused on the Auto Regressive characteristics of time series. The focus on correlations was because the reservoir performance depends on long-term average runoffs. In order to compare the datasets, a correlation analysis was performed at daily, fortnightly, monthly, three monthly and annual time scales. Moreover, the spatial variability of statistics of gridded rainfall series were calculated and plotted at the catchment scale. The NARCLiM data were able to successfully reproduce the autocorrelations of observed rainfall at each time scale. The correlation analysis shows a good agreement between NARCliM data and ground truth at three months and annual time scales. The spatial variability plots show a possible link between the statistics and orography at the catchment scale. Preliminary results for an orographic analysis will be shown.",

To examine this question we formulated and evaluated elementary principles of water ethics relative to human rights for water and explored the need for global trade to improve societal access to water by transferring plant and animal commodities and the “virtual water” embedded in them. We defined human welfare benchmarks and evaluated country specific patterns of water use for food with, and without trade, over a 25-year period in order to elucidate the influence of trade and inequality on equability of water use. We found that trade improves mean water use and wellbeing, when related to human welfare benchmarks, suggesting that inequality is regrettable but not necessarily unjust. However, trade has not significantly contributed to redressing inequality. Hence, directed trade decisions can improve future conditions of water and food scarcity through reduced inequality.",

            "abstract": "It has recently been proposed that volcanic hotspots and the reconstructed eruption sites of large igneous provinces (LIPs) are preferentially located above the margins of two deep mantle large low shear-wave velocity provinces (LLSVPs), beneath the African continent and the Pacific Ocean. This spatial correlation has been interpreted to imply that LLSVPs represent long-lived, dense, stable thermo-chemical piles, which preferentially trigger mantle plumes at their edges and exert a strong influence on lower-mantle dynamics. Here, we re-analyse this spatial correlation, demonstrating that it is not global: it is strong for the African LLSVP, but weak for the Pacific. Moreover, Monte-Carlo based statistical analyses indicate that the observed distribution of African and Pacific hotspots/reconstructed LIPs are consistent with the hypothesis that they are drawn from a sample that is uniformly distributed across the entire areal extent of each LLSVP: the strong spatial correlation with the margin of the African LLSVP is expected as a simple consequence of its elongated geometry, where greater than 75% of the LLSVP interior lies within 10° of its margin. Our results imply that the geographical distribution of hotspots and reconstructed LIPs does not indicate the extent to which chemical heterogeneity influences lower-mantle dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Ice volume (and hence sea level) and deep-sea temperature are key measures of global climate change. Sea level has been documented using several independent methods over the past 0.5 million years (Myr). Older periods, however, lack such independent validation; all existing records are related to deep-sea oxygen isotope (d18O) data that are influenced by processes unrelated to sea level. For deep-sea temperature, only one continuous high-resolution (Mg/Ca-based) record exists, with related sea-level estimates, spanning the past 1.5 Myr. We have recently presented a novel sea-level reconstruction, with associated estimates of deep-sea temperature, which independently validates the previous 0–1.5 Myr reconstruction and extends it back to 5.3 Myr ago. A serious of caveats applies to this new method, especially in older times of its application, as is always the case with new methods. Independent validation exercises are needed to elucidate where consistency exists, and where solutions drift away from each other. A key observation from our new method is that a large temporal offset existed during the onset of Plio-Pleistocene ice ages, between a marked cooling step at 2.73 Myr ago and the first major glaciation at 2.15 Myr ago. This observation relies on relative changes within the dataset, which are more robust than absolute values. I will discuss our method and its main caveats and avenues for improvement.",

            "abstract": "There are a variety of in-situ instruments that are deployed on aircraft for measuring cloud properties, some of which provide data which are used to produce number and mass concentrations of water droplets and ice crystals and their size and shape distributions. Each of these instruments has its strengths and limitations that must be recognized and taken into account during analysis of the data. Various processing techniques have been developed by different groups and techniques implemented to partially correct for the known uncertainties and limitations. The cloud measurement community has in general acknowledged the various issues associated with these instruments and numerous studies have published processing algorithms that seek to improve data quality; however, there has not been a forum in which these various algorithms and processing techniques have been discussed and consensus reached both on optimum analysis strategy and on quantification of uncertainties on the derived data products.\nPrior to the 2014 AMS Cloud Physics Conference, a study was conducted in which many data sets taken from various aircraft (NCAR-130, North Dakota Citation, Wyoming King Air and FAAM BAE-146) and many instruments (FSSP, CDP, SID, 2D-C/P, CIP/PIP, 2D-S, CPI, Nevzorov Probe and King Hot-wire LWC sensor) were processed by more than 20 individuals or groups to produce a large number of derived products (size distributions, ice fraction, number and mass concentrations, CCN/IN concentrations and median volume diameter). Each person or group that processed a selected data set used their own software and algorithm to produce a secondary data file with derived parameters whose name was encoded to conceal the source of the file so that this was a blind comparison.\nThe workshop that was convened July 5 and 6, 2014, presented the results of the evaluation of the derived products with respect to individual instruments as well as the types of conditions under which the measurements were made. This comparison will ultimately allow quantifying the error bars of derived parameters as a function of the conditions in which the observations are made. The results of this evaluation and the recommendations that evolved from the workshop will be summarized in this presentation.",

Approximately 3 m deep Urami Trench allowed intrusion of brackish water that caused density stratification within the lake and development euxinic bottom water. This distinct parallel lamination is considered as varves, but previous “varve”counting fails to prove its annual origin. In this study, we sampled top several tens of centimeter of the Lake Suigetsu sediment using Limnos Sediment Sampler. A high-resolution age-depth model based on radioisotopes 137Cs and 210Pb profiles and 14C dating are compared with the age-depth model based on varve counting. The two curves agreed within the error that is less than 10 years at the bottom. Thus, the lamination is proved to be varves. This age model allows us to examine annual-resolution record of river discharge, eolian dust flux, and seismic events.\nLamination is generally from 1 to 2 mm thick, dark gray in color and rich in diatom. In addition, there are a few thicker (>2mm) lamina characterized with sharp and slightly erosional at the bottom and gradational at the top. Based on these characteristics, we call them “Event layers”.\nLight gray Event layers are common in the Suigetsu sediments, and interpreted as representing flood events although supporting evidence is insufficient. We correlated them to contemporary observational precipitation record. These light gray Event layers are well correlated to the historical record of the flood disasters in Lake Suigetsu within +/_ 3 years during the past 70 years. Assuming these light gray event layers represents flood events, we fine-tuned the age-depth model and examined the correlation between precipitation record and flux of detrital materials estimated from the sedimentary record. The result will be presented and implication will be discussed.",

In the presence of a dust storm, all the above mentioned SOA species in Xi’an are predominantly enriched on coarse particles (>2.1 µm). Oxalic acid well correlated with NO3- (r2=0.72, p<0.01) rather than SO42-. This phenomenon differs greatly from the observed particles during a non-dust storm period, which is characterized by an enrichment of the SOA on fine particles (<2.1 µm) with a strong correlation between C2 and SO42-. We propose a three-step formation pathway to explain these observations as follows. First, nitric acid and nitrogen oxides react with dust to form a liquid film on the surface via water vapor-absorption of calcium nitrate. Second, gaseous Gly and mGly partition into the aqueous-phase. Finally, the aqueous-phase Gly and mGly oxidize into glyoxylic acid (wC2), followed by a further oxidation into C2. To the best of our knowledge, we found for the first time the enrichments of glyoxal (Gly) and methylglyoxal (mGly) on dust surfaces. Our data indicate a more critical role of nitrate than sulfate in the heterogeneous formation process of SOA on dust surfaces. Mass ratio of C2 to wC2 was found to be higher in coarse particles than in fine particles during the dust storm events, which is due to low acidity condition of large particles that is favorable for conversion of wC2 to C2.",

            "abstract": "Two-pyroxene granulite xenoliths recovered from the Shavaryn-Tsaram Quaternary basaltic breccia pipe near Tariat Mongolia provide a snapshot of the modern lower crust beneath the elevated Hangay Dome in central Mongolia. Two-pyroxene thermometry indicates the xenoliths equilibrated at temperatures of 840 ± 30ºC. Previous studies using the Grt-Opx-Pl barometer indicated an upper limit on pressures between 12.5 and 15.5 kbar for samples collected from the same locality (Stosch et al., 1995). Whole-rock trace-element data for the xenoliths show similar trends to arc-derived magmatic rocks, with enrichments in the large-ion lithophile elements and rare earth elements compared to depletion in the high field-strength elements. The arc-like geochemical signature of the lower crust suggests it did not form through underplating during the most recent phase of Cenozoic volcanism, which has geochemical characteristics typical of intraplate volcanism. Instead, the lower crust beneath the Hangay dome may have formed during the accretion of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) in the Late Paleozoic to Early Mesozoic. Alternatively, it could include remnants of older Precambrian basement accreted during the formation of the CAOB. Abundant zircon observed in the samples will be dated by U-Pb laser ablation ICP-MS and ID-TIMS to better determine the timing of lower-crust formation and metamorphism. To the extent that a crustal root supports the high elevation of Hangay region, constraining the age of the root will help place constraints on the timing of crustal thickening and the attainment of high elevation. The post-orogenic, long-term thermal evolution of the lower crust can be assessed using U-Pb analyses of a number of trace phases, including monazite and apatite. Results from these measurements will address the timing and evolution of the high topography in central Mongolia.",

            "abstract": "Understanding how magnetic energy is transported and converted into kinetic and thermal energy during the interaction of the solar wind with the dayside magnetospheric boundary has been a challenging problem. This is because it is a complex multi-scale process. Studies of the energy transport must follow both the evolution of the large-scale interaction and the details of the kinetic processes that enable that transport in localized regions. To approach this problem, we have carried out 2-½ dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations for southward interplanetary magnetic field conditions. The extensive domain (7RE x 8RE) used in the simulations allows us to include large-scale features of the solar wind interaction with the geomagnetic field (e.g., curvature and plasma asymmetries at the magnetospheric boundary) while also resolving local kinetic processes such as those occurring at the bow shock and the magnetopause. The computing challenge is addressed by using the results of global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to provide initial and boundary conditions for a two-dimensional version of the implicit iPic3d simulation code. We discuss the PIC simulation results in the context of the initial steady MHD state and spacecraft observations to highlight the effects of kinetic processes. In particular, we correlate particle distributions with the wave activity occurring in different regions of the simulations to assess the effects of wave-particle interactions on the transport through the bow shock-magnetosheath-magnetopause system.",

The double-difference technique with Lg-wave cross- correlation enabled our computation of accurate epicenters for small earthquakes. Offshore of the city of Boryeong, more than 150 earthquakes occurred from July through August 2013, which is abnormal seismicity for Korea. We relocate 149 epicenters displaying high waveform similarity using 11 stations with an azimuthal gap exceeding 130˚. Relocated epicenters form a 700-m line with clear northeastward progression during the period, and correspond well with the northeast–southwest strike of the fault-plane solution for the largest event (ML3.8). From the sequence, we classified two spatiotemporally separated clusters by Lg-coda waveform similarity: Cluster A with 107 events occurred during entire Boryeong sequence , and Cluster B with 25 events occurred only from 21 to 25 June 2013. We used a dendrogram derived from the maximum correlation coefficients representing the similarity of 149 events among Lg coda. Relocated epicenters tightly clustered, and the longest epicenter line shrank in size by a factor of several tens. Spatial distribution of the relocated epicenters reflected locations of clusters classified according to the similarity of waveforms for Lg coda. In the Boryeong sequence, relocated epicenters showed clear northeastward migration during a 2-month period.",

Due to the charged grains’ large gyroradii (>> RE), they carry most of the negative charge away from the picked-up ion flow, which leads to a current system different from the ion pick-up and Birkeland current system. We will study the grain and ion currents based on their motion, develop a self-consistent current system near Enceladus, and estimate the consequent electromagnetic perturbations. Comparing the modeled magnetic perturbations with the MAG data may determine the magnitude of the total grain current, which in turn will give constraints on the grain charge density to compare with RPWS-LP plasma data in the plume.",

            "abstract": "In Japan, damage and disasters from historical large earthquakes have been documented and preserved. Compilation of historical earthquake documents started in the early 20th century and 33 volumes of historical document source books (about 27,000 pages) have been published. However, these source books are not effectively utilized for researchers due to a contamination of low-reliability historical records and a difficulty for keyword searching by characters and dates. To overcome these problems and to promote historical earthquake studies in Japan, construction of text database started in the 21 century.\nAs for historical earthquakes from the beginning of the 7th century to the early 17th century, “Online Database of Historical Documents in Japanese Earthquakes and Eruptions in the Ancient and Medieval Ages” (Ishibashi, 2009) has been already constructed. They investigated the source books or original texts of historical literature, emended the descriptions, and assigned the reliability of each historical document on the basis of written age. Another database compiled the historical documents for seven damaging earthquakes occurred along the Sea of Japan coast in Honshu, central Japan in the Edo period (from the beginning of the 17th century to the middle of the 19th century) and constructed text database and seismic intensity data base. These are now publicized on the web (written only in Japanese).\nHowever, only about 9 % of the earthquake source books have been digitized so far. Therefore, we plan to digitize all of the remaining historical documents by the research-program which started in 2014. The specification of the data base will be similar for previous ones. We also plan to combine this database with liquefaction traces database, which will be constructed by other research program, by adding the location information described in historical documents. Constructed database would be utilized to estimate the distributions of seismic intensities and tsunami heights.",

Melting of calving front below and at the water surface plays important roles\nin the mass balance of calving glaciers, but these processes are not well understood.\nMoreover, studies on frontal melting of freshwater calving glaciers are very few. To better\nunderstand the effects of subaqueous and waterline melting on glacier changes in\nPatagonia, we measured the terminus position, surface velocity, lake surface and air\ntemperatures at Glaciar Perito Moreno, Southern Patagonia Icefield. These data were used\nto calculate frontal ablation rate (calving rate plus subaqueous melt rate), a melt rate at the\nwaterline and quantity of calving flux and subaqueous melting. The terminus position and\nsurface velocity showed clear seasonal variations between 1999 and 2013. The glacier\nretreated from December to June, and then it advanced for the rest of the year. The mean\nsurface velocity near the terminus was 500±100 m a-1 in winter (June–August) and\n590±160 m a-1 in summer (December–February). The mean frontal ablation rate also\nshowed seasonal variations with 280±130 m a-1 in winter and 770±180 m a-1 in summer.\nThese results suggest that the seasonal terminus variations are the result of phase shift\nbetween the seasonal variations in the surface velocity and the frontal ablation rate. The\nfraction of the frontal ablation to the total mass loss is 31% and only 4%. However, the\nseasonal variations in the frontal ablation rate correlated with the lake surface temperature\n(R2 =0.86), suggesting the importance of waterline melting as a triggering mechanism of\ncalving.",

A continuous magnetostratigraphy was recovered from the muds of the distal sequence, despite challenges presented by downhole alteration. Rock magnetic parameters, which track diagenesis and alteration of the magnetic iron oxides and sulfides, exhibit a background downhole trend towards increasingly mature pyritization that is surprisingly similar to patterns seen in ODP sites drilled in hemipelagic sediments with much lower volcanogenic input. Superimposed on this trend are excursions which parallel features in pore-water geochemistry and physical properties, apparently marking fluid migration and diffusion at depth. Low values of saturation isothermal remanence (SIRM) after 300 mT back-field demagnetization, S-0.3T, which typically indicate production of greigite, accompany a deep sulfate diffusion zone from a fluid source at about 275 mbsf. SIRM normalized for susceptibility (SIRM/k) reaches its maximum value at about 460 mbsf, matching an offset in foliation development in AMS (anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility), and corresponding to the position of the highest value in the sulfate profile (reaching seawater concentration), inflections in Li, Mg and other species, and an increase in lithification marked by a break in the porosity profile. A second fluid source at this depth, perhaps along the lithification front, seems indicated. Interruption to otherwise continuous magnetostratigraphy across the break between coring in Holes U437D and U1437E suggests the presence of a normal fault. A sudden change to multidomain-dominated magnetic mineralogy below the break between holes, and the equally sudden appearance of ethane in headspace gas, suggest a contrasting fluid circulation environment in the foot and hanging walls.",

            "abstract": "Basal ice temperature is a critical boundary condition for ice sheet models. It modulates the basal melt rate and sliding conditions, and also affects the ice hardness which alters the deformational velocity. Therefore, in order to obtain reliable estimates on the future mass loss of the ice sheets using numerical models, basal ice temperature is of paramount importance. In this study, the basal temperature and basal melt rate under the Greenland Ice Sheet are estimated using the Robin temperature solution. The analytical Robin solution is obtained by solving the heat conservation equation for steady state conditions, assuming that advection and diffusion are significant only in the vertical direction. In this study, the sensitivity of the basal temperature obtained from the Robin solution to changes in input parameters, including changes in atmospheric conditions, ice thickness, and geothermal heat flux is tested.\nAlthough the Robin solution is frequently used in glaciology, there has been no quantitative study to estimate the effect of neglecting the horizontal advection on basal temperatures in regions of higher velocity. Here, a two-dimensional model is applied to quantify the effect of horizontal heat advection on basal temperatures. Overall, horizontal heat advection lowers the basal temperature except in regions where surface mass balance gradients are negative along the flow. Comparing the results from the 2D temperature model to the Robin solution along multiple flowlines of the Greenland Ice Sheet suggest that the horizontal heat advection alters the basal temperatures by less than 3°C up to 30-45% of the flow distance away from the ice divide; at greater distances this difference increases rapidly. All simulations using the Robin solution predict substantial basal melting under the northeast drainage basin of the ice sheet. Our 2D model results also show that because of the negative surface mass balance gradient, horizontal heat advection increases the basal temperatures in the northeast basin. Our obtained map of basal melting area matches well with the radar detected basal water under the north and northeast drainage basins. However, low basal temperatures estimated at the Camp Century ice core location in the northwest of the ice sheet is in contrast with the radar observations.",

            "abstract": "The 2013 Sea of Okhotsk deep earthquake (Mw8.3) generated felt reports worldwide including ones from Moscow (~58 degrees) and Dubai (~76 degrees) (NEIC, 2013). The earthquake was recorded by many global seismic stations with a good coverage of azimuth and distance, which provides an opportunity to understand the global characteristics of ground shaking. Peak ground accelerations (PGA) from the Sea of Okhotsk deep earthquake decrease with distance up to 120 degrees, and have a peak at a distance of 140-150 degrees. The variation as a function of distance is similar to the one shown by Anderson et al. (1995) for the 1994 Bolivia earthquake. PGA at distances between 40 and 85 degrees are associated with vertical components of direct P waves, and the values are mostly in a range from 0.1 to 1 gal. The decay with distance is in agreement with that of P wave amplitude predicted by the ray theory with t* in the range between the lower-mantle attenuation models of Hwang and Ritsema (2011) and PREM. Frequencies characterizing the PGA decay are in a range between 0.8 and 1.8 Hz. As also suggested by observations from other large deep earthquakes, the radiation pattern of P waves can change the decay curves of PGA with distance, by affecting the amplitude of P waves in the frequency range. Spatial variations of PGA are likely to be characterized by the tectonic setting; large values of PGA appear in stable continents and old seas, whereas small values are observed in tectonically active regions. Positive correlation is observed between PGA values and velocity perturbations of the 3-D global shear velocity model at depths shallower than 100 km.",

In this study, we have systematically studied ULF waves excited at in the magnetosphere by interplanetary shock or solar wind dynamic pressure impulse. We have found that the poloidal and toroidal waves excited by positive and negative pressure pulses oscillate in a similar manner of phase near 06:00 local time (MLT) and 18:00 M LT, but in antiphase near 12:00 M LT and 0:00 MLT. ULF waves generated by IP shock impact is much stronger than that to negative pressure pulses. Furthermore, it is shown that excited ULF oscillations are in general stronger around local noon than those in the dawn and dusk flanks. It is demonstrated that the poloidal wave amplitudes are stronger than the toroidal wave amplitudes except in the magnetotail.\nIn the energetic particle point of view that the magnitude of IP shock generated ULF waves (energetic particle flux oscillations) are much larger around 12:00 LT than at dawn and dusk and oscillate in an opposite phase near local noon and midnight。 A frequency preference in the oscillations in between 2.2 mHz and 3.3 mHz. The oscillations are stronger under southward IMF condition than that under northward IMF condition. Plasmapause /PBL would modify the generated ULF waves.",

            "abstract": "The tsunami caused by the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake mainly inundated the Tohoku coastal areas, most of which exceeded inundation area specified in tsunami hazard maps. A report by the Japanese government for the IAEA Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety clearly stated that there is difficulty of quantitatively assessing natural disaster risk associated with a rare event such as tsunami because of uncertainty, and sufficient efforts have not been made so far to enhance the public confidence in the risk assessment by explicitly indicating the uncertinty of the assessment. Based on the statement, we propose a new method for explicitly indicating the uncertainty of tsunami hazard assessment in the tsunami hazard map.\nFirstly, we estimated stochastic wave height along the Tohoku coastal areas using a method for probabilistic tsuami hazard assessment in order to quantitatively assess the uncertainty of coastal wave heights. We selected eleven earthquake-generic areas along the Japan trench as the areas that could generate tsunamis. Secondly, in order to calculate tsunami inundation area due to the average coastal wave height for one return period, we identified the earthquake fault that generate the target wave height and conducted numerical simulation using non-linear long-wave equations with inputting their fault parameters. On the other hand, in order to calculate tsunami inundation area due to fractile coastal wave height that consider the uncertainty of the assessment, we generated a hypothetical earthquake fault that the dislocation of which was uniformly increased or decreased by multiplying a constant number according to the change of each fractile wave height, and conducted numerical simulation in the same way. As a result, there were big differences among tsunami inudation areas due to 0.05 fractile, simple average and 0.95 fractile wave height at coastal points even though the assumed wave height generate by one target return period.\nA preliminary assessment of tsunami hazard includes large uncertainty. Therefore, we expected that what we quantitatively assessed how much the tsunami hazard assessment includes the uncertaity and clearly show the uncertainty in the tsunami hazard map leads to a proper undrstainding of users such as regional regidents who utilize the tsunami hazard maps.",

            "abstract": "A large earthquake triggers persistent aftershock activity in and near the focal region. Thus, intermediate term forecasting of aftershocks at its earlier stage is important for mitigating seismic risks. A main difficulty for the early forecasting is the substantial incompleteness of early aftershock data. To deal with such incomplete data, we have developed a statistical model of the incomplete data, enabling us to obtain the immediate estimate of the forecasting models from incomplete data [1, 2]. Another difficulty for the intermediate term forecasting is that we have to determine the parameter values of the forecasting models with high accuracy, because even a small bias in the parameter values can lead to a significant bias of the forecasting in intermediate term. However such accurate estimation is quite difficult at the early stage, especially using the early and incomplete data. Here we present a Bayesian forecasting method by using the epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model. The Bayesian forecasting considers not only the best parameter values such as the maximum likelihood estimates or maximum a posteriori estimates but also the estimation uncertainty of the parameter values. By analyzing aftershock sequences in Japan, we show the forecasting performances of the intermediate-term aftershocks can be significantly improved by considering the estimation uncertainty of the ETAS model [3]. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of the modeling of the magnitude frequency distribution of detected aftershocks within a day span on the forecasting of large aftershocks.\n[1] T. Omi, Y. Ogata, Y.

            "abstract": "Gravity and topography data including new results obtained from recent Cassini RADAR and Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) observations suggest that Titan has a rigid and conductive crust, greater than 40 km in thickness (Beghin et al., 2012; Hemingway et al., 2013; Lopes et al., 2013; Mitri et al., 2014; Lefevre et al., 2014; Baland et al., 2014). In this work we employed rheological models based on clathrate hydrate stability fields and modeled geothermal gradients to investigate how clathrate hydrates may influence the rheology of Titan’s crust. Our findings suggest that a thick, rigid, and conductive crust composed of pure water ice is unlikely. Instead, a mixed phase crust comprised of water ice and clathrate hydrates, with up to 40 to 50% methane clathrates, results in thermal conductivity, viscosity, and density values consistent with Cassini observations. We modeled variations in Rayleigh number with crustal thickness for different crustal compositions assuming constant viscosity. Addition of methane clathrates makes the mixed ice-clathrate crust more viscous resulting in smaller Rayleigh numbers with depth compared to ice-only models. This slower rate of increase in Rayleigh number is also associated with increasing critical Rayleigh numbers, and hence, the potential thickness of a rigid, conductive crust. Modeling basal viscosity for different crustal compositions, following McKinnon (2006), we also determined that a methane clathrate-rich conductive crust would likely be much thicker (~60 km) than a non-convecting pure water-ice crust (~12 km). Titan’s carbon content constrained by different formation models (Tobie et al., 2012) shows that even a pure methane clathrate crust is possible. However, a pure methane clathrate crust is unlikely because it would be relatively thin, less than 20 km due to clathrate’s low thermal conductivity. Therefore, a mixed phase crust may explain both the geophysical observations and significant methane concentrations in Titan’s atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "We propose to understand and quantify wave-breaking dissipation in the evolution of general irregular short-crested wave-fields using direct nonlinear phase-resolved simulations based on a High-Order Spectral (HOS) method (Dommermuth & Yue 1987). We implement a robust phenomenological-based energy dissipation model in HOS to capture the effect of wave-breaking dissipation on the overall wave-field evolution (Xiao et al 2013). The efficacy of this model is confirmed by direct comparisons against measurements for the energy loss in 2D and 3D breaking events.\nBy comparing simulated wave-fields with and without the dissipation model in HOS, we obtain the dissipation field δ(x,y,t), which provides the times, locations and intensity of wave breaking events (δ>δc). This is validated by comparison of HOS simulations with Airborne Terrain Mapper (ATM) measurements in the recent ONR Hi-Res field experiment. Figure (a) shows one frame of simulated wave-field (with dissipation model). Figure (b) is the corresponding measurement from ATM, where a large wave breaking event was captured. Figure (c) is the 3D view of the simulated wave-field with the colored region representing dissipation with δ>δc. The HOS predicted high-dissipation area is found to agree well with the measured breaking area. Based on HOS predicted high-dissipation area (δ>δc), we calculate Λ(c) (Phillips 1985), the distribution of total length of breaking wave front per unit surface area per unit increment of breaking velocity c. Figure (d) shows the distribution Λ(c) calculated from HOS. For breaking speeds c greater than 5m/s, the simulated Λ(c) is in qualitative agreement with Phillips theoretical power-law of Λ(c)~c-6.\nFrom δ(x,y,t), we further quantify wave breaking by calculating the whitecap coverage rate Wr(t) and energy dissipation rate ΔE'(t), and study the evolution of Wr and ΔE' to understand the role of wave breaking in nonlinear wave-field evolution. We obtain HOS simulations starting with initial 3D wave-fields given by JONSWAP directional spectra with a range of peak enhancement factors and spreading angles. We find that both Wr and ΔE' evolve to their peak values over a short time (t/Tp~O(ε-1), ε is wave steepness) and after longer evolution (t/Tp>O(ε-2)) they reach a quasi-stationary state.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake rupture directivity is essential for studying seismic hazard and understanding seismogenic processes by resolving the ruptured fault. Point source approximation with centroid moment tensor (CMT) or fault plane solution only provides two nodal planes instead of specifying the physical rupture plane, thus leading to fault plane ambiguity. For mega-earthquakes (M7+), slip distribution can be resolved through finite fault modeling (Ji et al., 2002). For moderate earthquakes (M4~6), relative source time function (RSTF) can be obtained from deconvolving the empirical green's functions or forward modeling, and the rupture directivity can be determined from fitting RSTF of stations with small azimuth gap in a dense seismic network(Luo et al., 2010). But for sparse network, station azimuthal coverage is not sufficient for such studies.\nWe propose a technique to determine the rupture plane via measuring the spatial difference between centroid location and hypocenter. The technique involves of waveform time shift difference of mainshock and refer events (smaller events with similar focal mechanism), which calibrates errors due to velocity heterogeneity and absolute location error. Relative hypocenter locations and relative centroid locations are resolved by relative location method of onset travel times and waveform cross-correlation respectively. The difference between onset travel times and waveform-derived centroid times against the azimuthal variations is then used to infer the mainshock rupture directivity.\nWe apply the method to the 2008 Illinois Mw5.2 earthquake. Four M3.4+ aftershocks are chosen as refer events, we generate synthetics using focal mechanism from SLU earthquake center, and measure the time shift difference for stations. The resolved rupture plane strikes northwest-southeast, consistent with spatial distribution of relocated aftershocks using hypoDD (Hongfeng Yang et al., 2009). The method works for earthquakes of unilateral rupture, which consist of 80% of all earthquake as demonstrated by previous studies.",

MLTWA observations require numerous data from multiple earthquakes inevitably causing large scatter by the facts - radiation pattern, focal depth, and regional alteration - which are neglected by theoretical simulation currently assuming a single source.\nMLTWA using single earthquake data may, therefore, be helpful to reduce observational scatter by considering radiation pattern, focal depth, and regional alteration. To take into account radiation pattern of single event data, focal mechanism algorithm is implanted to code of DSMC method. In addition, this study selected data from the previous study using focal depth of about 10 km and compared the results between single events and multiple events.\nMLTWA using single event provided stable results for all frequencies if number of recorded station is 10 or/and more. Although only focal depth and regional alteration was considered excluding radiation pattern, result of MLTWA using single event showed plausible results by regional combination - Q-1 values of two regionally reliable events are selected as the lower and upper bounds. By this combination, the three zones of Q-1 values were obtained for A as Gyeongsan Basin, B as western plain region, and C as rugged terrain such as mountainous region and sea with abrupt change of depth. The Q-1 values in descending order are C, A, and B, remarkable of which is at low frequencies of Qs−1. The values of Zone A and B correlate well with those of regional QLg−1 at 1 Hz. The highest Q−1 of zone C correlates with the result of worldwide studies showing high Q−1 values by the effect of lateral path propagating through high mountainous region.\nIn Fig. 1, Q−1 values generally correlate with tectonic activity and volcanism, measured hypocentral distance, and focal depth of event data. In addition, high Q−1 values are observed for the regions including zone C by the effect of lateral path propagating through high mountainous region. This path effect seems to be required a quantitative analysis by using tomographic approaches.\nFig. 1.

            "abstract": "Quantitative mapping of high resolution surface soil texture (percentage sand, silt and clay), soil organic matter and chemical constituents are important for understanding infiltration, runoff and other surficial hydrologic processes at different scales. The Visible Near Infrared Analysis (VNIRA) method, which is a combination of imaging spectroscopy and laboratory chemical analysis with an underlying statistical model, has been established for the quantification of soil properties from imaging spectrometer data. In this study we characterize the feasibility of quantifying soil properties over large areas with the aim that these methods may be extended to space-borne sensors such as HyspIRI. Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) is a space-borne NASA mission concept having 10nm contiguous bands in the VSWIR region (380nm to 2500nm) of the electromagnetic spectra. High resolution (7.6m) Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data collected by NASA immediately after the massive 2011 Mississippi River floods at the Birds Point New Madrid (BPNM) floodway, coupled with in situ samples obtained at the time of the flight, is used to generate HyspIRI like data at 60m resolution. The VNIRA method is applied in a data-mining framework for quantification of the different soil textural properties and chemical constituents. The empirical models are further used for creating quantitative maps of the soil properties for the entire BPNM floodway. These maps are compared with the fine resolution AVIRIS maps of the same area for the different legacy landscape features and spatial correlations with the underlying topography immediately disturbed by the flooding event. The scales of variation in the soil constituents captured by the fine resolution data are also compared to the scales of variation captured by coarser resolution data. This study further explores the issues of applicability, challenges (such as the sensitivity of NDVI from mixed neighborhood pixels and calibration sample sizes on the results) and limitations (field soil sample data collection) of the VNIRA method for determination of soil properties. We expect that the approach can be extended broadly and will lead to the characterization of soil properties that will be benefit a variety of studies.",

            "abstract": "The exosphere of Mars is very extensive and the hot oxygen corona, produced photochemically in the ionosphere, extends tens of Martian radii from the planet. This exosphere is a source of oxygen ions, picked up by the solar wind electric and magnetic fields, and accelerated toward Mars. The pickup ion energies depend on solar wind conditions and during high speed solar winds (> 500 km/s) with large angles between the solar wind bulk flow velocity and the interplanetary magnetic field (> 50 degrees), oxygen pickup ions can reach energies high enough (> 60 keV) to be detected by SEP. The SEP (Solar Energetic Particle) instrument is an energetic particle detector on board the MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) spacecraft, scheduled to reach Mars in September 2014. In this study, the instrumental geometry and response function of SEP are included in a modeling analysis of the effect that different solar wind conditions and SEP look directions will have on O+ pickup ion energy spectra. We describe a method that provides constraints on neutral oxygen escape models by linking the SEP energy spectra to the photochemical source of hot oxygen. Additionally, we present model results for pick-up ion distributions, and their possible detection by the SEP, STATIC (SupraThermal And Thermal Ion Composition) and SWIA (Solar Wind Ion Analyzer) instruments on board MAVEN, during the close passage of Comet Siding Spring to Mars on October 19, 2014. Large ion flux enhancements near Mars originating from the comet’s neutral coma are predicted.",

            "abstract": "Soil moisture is an important variable in hydrological systems affecting the water cycle in the atmosphere, land surface and subsurface. In past decades, a number of passive microwave based soil moisture products have been used in various fields of the earth sciences. While passive microwave can provide near-real time soil moisture (global coverage every 1-3 days), its direct applications have been limited due to the coarse spatial resolution (>100 km2) and uncertainties resulting from a number of complex factors that affects the radiative transfer model. In this aspect, it is essential to validate the accuracy prior to actual applications and to improve the dataset itself and the retrieval algorithms. As a first step to do this, two remotely sensed soil moisture products from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), retrieved by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) algorithm and the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) are assessed and structural errors noted. The main findings are: 1) LPRM estimates are generally higher than JAXA except for in arid regions. 2) Comparisons with field measurements showed that JAXA has relatively better performance for locations with moderate vegetation density or dry conditions but the retrieved values are generally much lower than field measurements with little variance. 3) The advantage of LPRM is its ability to represent the relationship of soil moisture with surface temperature. 4) The performance of both products is strongly affected by the mean soil moisture. As it is found that the two products are complementary under the various conditions, a combinatorial approach is presented for improving the accuracy of soil moisture dataset. The approach is a linear combination technique which applies a spatio-temporal weighting, calculated based on error statistics of the products, to each product. This combinatorial approach is applied to a year of global dataset and generally shows better performances than the original products",

            "abstract": "The increasing food and water demands of East Africa’s growing population are stressing the region’s inconsistent water resources and rain-fed agriculture. As recently as 2011, part of this region underwent one of the worst famine events in its history. Timely and skillful drought forecasts at a seasonal scale for this region can inform better water and agro-pastoral management decisions, support optimal allocation of the region's water resources, and mitigate socio-economic losses incurred by droughts. However, seasonal drought prediction in this region faces several challenges including lack of skillful seasonal rainfall forecasts.\nThe National Multi-model Ensemble (NMME); a state-of-the-art dynamical climate forecast system is potentially a promising tool for drought prediction in this region. The NMME incorporates climate forecasts from 6+ fully coupled dynamical models resulting in 100+ forecasts ensemble members. Recent studies have indicated that in general NMME offers improvement over forecasts from any of the individual model. However, thus far the skill of NMME for forecasting rainfall in a vulnerable region like East Africa has largely been unexplored. In this presentation we report findings of a comprehensive analysis that examines the strength and weakness of NMME in forecasting rainfall at seasonal scale in East Africa for all three of the prominent seasons of the region. (i.e. March-April-May, July-August-September, and October-November-December). Additionally we describe a hybrid approach that combines statistical method with NMME forecasts to improve rainfall forecast skill in the region when raw NMME forecasts skill is lacking. This approach uses constructed analog method to improve NMME’s March-April-May rainfall forecast skill in East Africa.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have revealed the ubiquitous oceanic crustal components in Cenozoic intra-continental basalts in eastern China (Zhang et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2012a, b). The main arguments in support of this include: (a) strong similarity of trace element patterns and Fe/Mn ratios of these continental basalts with respect to oceanic island basalts; (b) coupled high Fe2O3and water contents and low87Sr/86Sr ratio; (c) high d18O less than mantle values recorded in olivine and clinopyroxene phenocrysts; (d) pyroxenite-dominated source as constrained by comparison of olivine-hosted melt inclusions with experimental results. Whether these recycled oceanic components from the core-mantle boundary (CMB) or from the mantle transition zone is a matter of debate. In the case of eastern Asian continent, we favor for a provenance from the mantle transition zone given the following considerations: (a) Geophysical studies show a stagnantPacific slab within the mantle transition zone underneath the studied region. Such a sandwich structure prevailed at least since late Cretaceous thus ruling out the possibility that oceanic crustal components from the CMB; (b) Pb isotopes do not show the high time-integrated 238U/204Pb mantle component expectedfor a HIMU basalt, suggesting a young age of recycled components. (c) The same Indian MORB-like isotopiccomposition is found in the eastern China Cenozoic basalts and in the extinct Izanaghi–Pacific plate ofNWPacific. This suggests that the recycled oceanic components may have been derived from the seismically detected stagnantPacific slab within the mantle transition zone. We thus speculate that not all recycled oceanic components are carried to the surface by mantle plumes, but can be transported to the shallow level by other processes from the mantle transition zone.",

            "abstract": "The theory that forests become carbon (C) neutral with maturity has recently been challenged. While a growing body of evidence shows that net C accumulation continues in forests that are centuries old, the reasons remain poorly known. Increasing canopy structural complexity, quantified by high variability in leaf distribution, has been proposed as a mechanism for sustained rates of C assimilation in mature forests. The goal of our research was to expand on these findings and explore a new idea of spatio-temporal canopy structural complexity as a mechanism linking canopy structure to function (C assimilation).\nOur work takes place at the UMBS AmeriFlux core facility (US-UMB) in northern Michigan, USA. Canopy structure was quantified over 6 seasons with portable canopy LiDAR (PCL) and canopy spatial microhabitat variability was studied using hemispherical photographs from different heights within the canopy. We found a more even distribution of irradiance in more structurally complex canopies within a single year, and furthermore, that between-year variability of spatial leaf arrangement decreased with increasing canopy complexity. We suggest that in complex canopies less redistribution of leaf material over time may lead to more similar light microhabitats within and among years. Conversely, in less complex canopies this relationship can lead to a year-to-year time lag in morphological leaf acclimation since the effects of the previous-year’s light environment are reflected in the morphological characteristics of current-year leaves.\nOur study harnesses unique spatio-temporal resolution measurements of canopy structure and microhabitat that can inform better management strategies seeking to maximize forest C uptake. Future research quantifying the relationship between canopy structure and light distribution will improve performance of ecosystem models that currently lack spatially explicit canopy structure information.",

            "abstract": "Surface Solar Radiation (SSR) plays an important role of the hydrological and land process modeling, which particularly contributes more than 90% to the total melt energy for the Tibetan Plateau (TP) ice melting. Neither surface measurement nor existing remote sensing products can meet that requirement in TP. The well-known satellite products (i.e. ISCCP-FD and GEWEX-SRB) are in relatively low spatial resolution (0.5º-2.5º) and temporal resolution (3-hourly, daily, or monthly). The objective of this study is to develop capabilities to improved estimates of SSR in TP based on geostationary satellite observations from the Multi-functional Transport Satellite (MTSAT) with high spatial (0.05º) and temporal (hourly) resolution. An existing physical model, the UMD-SRB (University of Maryland Surface Radiation Budget) which is the basis of the GEWEX-SRB model, is re-visited to improve SSR estimates in TP. The UMD-SRB algorithm transforms TOA radiances into broadband albedos in order to infer atmospheric transmissivity which finally determines the SSR. Specifically, main updates introduced in this study are: implementation at 0.05º spatial resolution at hourly intervals integrated to daily and monthly time scales; and improvement of surface albedo model by introducing the most recently developed Global Land Surface Broadband Albedo Product (GLASS) based on MODIS data. This updated inference scheme will be evaluated against ground observations from China Meteorological Administration (CMA) radiation stations and three TP radiation stations contributed from the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research.",

Many outlets of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet that occupy reverse bed slopes are currently in negative mass balance. New ice-penetrating radar data reveal that large overdeepened basins and reverse bed slopes exist under parts of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, raising concern for its future behaviour. Retreat of the Antarctic ice sheet from the Last Glacial Maximum to its present configuration provides an opportunity to assess ice-sheet response to climate forcing and ice-dynamic feedbacks. Here we report 44 new surface-exposure ages from an East Antarctic outlet glacier that thinned dramatically during the early/mid-Holocene at a rate comparable to modern rates of thinning at Pine Island Glacier. Rapid thinning was coeval with retreat of the grounding-line through an overdeepening on the inner continental-shelf, and the disintegration of a buttressing ice-shelf. We demonstrate that a similar magnitude and timing of ice-dynamic thinning also occurred on the West Antarctic and Peninsula ice-sheets, at a time of relative climatic and oceanic stability after grounding-lines had retreated to the inner continental-shelf. These results imply that significant ice-sheet thinning in the early/mid Holocene arose from topographic feedbacks rather than from significant environmental forcing.",

They enabled direct observation of fluids and have shown a large chemical and redox heterogeneity at the submicron scale, which is not observed in micron-sized inclusions. While crustal metamorphic diamonds are generally formed under oxidizing conditions, polycrystalline diamonds from the Earth's mantle and carbonado have inclusion suites reflecting variable, and sometimes extreme, redox conditions. Diamond fluid compositions, however, fall in the same compositional field for worldwide diamond fluids, regardless of their geodynamic environment. They conform with the fluid end-members established by studies on fibrous diamonds, suggesting a universally important role of a limited number of basic ingredients, namely carbonates, silicates, halides and water.\nStrong redox gradients reflected by the micro-inclusions indicate diamond precipitation via small-scale, ephemeral redox processes driven by the contrasting oxidation states of fluids and their depositional environment. The susceptibility of the melting point of mantle rocks to the presence of even small amounts of volatiles promotes melting simultaneous to diamond precipitation, which is further enhanced by the changing of fluid composition towards higher water activity. This creates a chemically heterogeneous environment, in which diamonds and their inclusions are precipitated via redox-freezing processes.",

            "abstract": "The presented work has been investigating the potential of optical and radar satellite remote sensing for the spatio-temporal analysis of landslide activity at a regional scale along the eastern rim of the Fergana Basin representing the area of highest landslide activity in Kyrgyzstan. For this purpose a multi-temporal satellite remote sensing database has been established for a 12.000 km2 study area in Southern Kyrgyzstan containing a multitude of optical data acquired during the last 28 years as well as TerraSAR-X and ALOS-PALSAR acquired since 2007. The optical data have been mainly used for creating a multi-temporal inventory of backdated landslide activity. For this purpose an automated approach for object-oriented multi-temporal landslide detection has been developed which is based on the analysis of temporal NDVI-trajectories complemented by relief information to separate landslide-related surface changes from other land cover changes. Applying the approach to the whole study area using temporal high resolution RapidEye time series data has resulted in the automated detection of 612 landslide objects covering a total area of approx. 7.3 km². Currently, the approach is extended to the whole multi-sensor time-series database for systematic analysis of longer-term landslide occurrence at a regional scale. Radar remote sensing has been focussing on SAR Interferometry (InSAR) to detect landslide related surface deformation. InSAR data were processed by repeat-pass interferometry using the DORIS and SARScape software. To better assess ground deformation related to individual landslide objects, InSAR time-series analysis has been applied using the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) method. Analysis of the results in combination with optical data and DEM information has revealed that most of the derived deformations are caused by slow movements in areas of already existing landslides indicating the reactivation of older slope failures. This way, InSAR analysis can contribute to the early recognition of landslide activation prior to the onset of larger slope failure and thus support early warning. Overall, combined analysis of optical and radar data enables systematic spatio-temporal derivatioin of ongoing and backdated landslide activity for subsequent GIS-based landslide hazard assessment.",

            "abstract": "The North Anatolian Fault (NAF) extends 1600 km westward from a junction with the East Anatolian Fault at the Karliova Triple Junction in eastern Turkey, across northern Turkey and into the Aegean Sea, accommodating about 25 mm/yr of right-lateral motion between Anatolia and the Eurasian plate. Since 1939, devastating earthquakes with magnitude greater than seven ruptured NAF westward, starting from 1939 Erzincan at the eastern Turkey and including the latest 1999 Izmit-Golcuk and the Duzce earthquakes in the Marmara region. Considering the fault segments ruptured by the May 24th, 2014 Northern Aegean earthquake, the only un-ruptured segments left behind NAF locate beneath the Marmara Sea and those segments keep their mystery due to their underwater location. To clarify the detailed fault geometry beneath the western Marmara Sea, we started to operate a series of ocean bottom seismographic (OBS) observations. As a first step, we deployed 3 pop-up type OBSs on 20th of March 2014 as a trial observation, and recovered them on 18thof June 2014. Although one of the OBSs worked only 6 days from the start of the observation, other two OBSs functioned properly during the whole 3-month observation period.\nOnly 8 earthquakes were reported near the OBS network in 3 months periods according to the Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute catalogue. Thus, we first searched for the microearthquakes missing by the land seismic network and estimated their precious location by using the initial 6 days data. We could identify about 50 earthquakes with more than 5 picking data of P and S first arrivals, and half of them located near the NAF. We also tested the hypocenter relocation by combining the land and OBS seismic data for the 8 earthquakes, and found that these earthquakes are located in between 12-24 km depths.\nNext, we are planning to deploy 10 OBSs from September 2014 to June 2015 as a second step for our observation. At the AGU fall meeting, we will be able to introduce the OBS location of this new observation. These OBS observations are conducted as a part of the “Earthquake and Tsunami Disaster Mitigation in the Marmara Region and Disaster Education in Turkey” project, financially supported by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), and the Ministry of Development in Turkey.",

            "abstract": "It is known that quiescent periods with only shallow cumuli prevalent are frequently observed even in the deep Tropics, which is considered from the climatological perspectives as an area harboring vigorous deep convection. It is argued in this work that the free-tropospheric (FT) moisture convergence is a crucial factor for separating the stable maintenance of isolated shallow cumuli in the quiescent periods from the self-sustaining growth of organized convective systems in the dynamic periods over tropical oceans. The analysis is based on a variety of satellite measurements including Aqua AIRS T and q soundings and QuikSCAT surface wind, composited with reference to the time before or after the occurrence of precipitating clouds detected by TRMM PR. The FT moisture convergence and updraft moisture flux at cloud base are then derived from this dataset under large-scale moisture budget constraint (see Figure). Free-tropospheric precipitation efficiency (FTPE), or the ratio of precipitation to updraft moisture flux at cloud base, is introduced as a measure of convective intensity (rather than the population) over the large-scale domain. The following hypothesis is discussed in light of the analysis results. Isolated shallow cumuli would stay shallow when large-scale FT moisture is diverging (although moisture is weakly converging when integrated over the whole troposphere) since an increase in cumulus population would be counteracted by an additional moisture divergence in the FT. When large-scale FT convergence is positive, in contrast, developing clouds would induce a more moisture input and allow an unstable growth to a highly organized convective system. Zero FT moisture convergence may serve as the neutrality separating the negative feedback acting in the quiescent regime from the positive feedback instrumental for the dynamic regime.",

            "abstract": "The next large-thrust earthquake along the Nankai Trough, southwest Japan is concerned to occur within this century. Nonvolcanic deep low-frequency tremors and earthquakes are observed around the down-dip limit of the coseismic rupture zone of the last Tonankai and Nankai earthquakes [Obara, 2002]. One of the causes of these low-frequency seismic phenomena is considered to be fluid generated by dehydration processes from the subducting slab. It is important to investigate structural variation in the incoming Philippine Sea plate, including its fluid content to understand the generation of the low-frequency seismic phenomena as well as large-thrust earthquakes.\nIn 2014, we conducted the seismic refraction and reflection survey in the northern margin of the Shikoku Basin, where the Philippine Sea plate is subducting beneath the Eurasia plate at the Nankai Trough. We conducted a 360km long seismic profile about 50-60km seaward of the deformation front along the Nankai Trough. 35 OBSs were deployed along the profile with the interval of 10km. A tuned airgun array shot with a total volume of 7800 cu. in. every 200m for OBSs, and 380 cu. in. every 37.5m for a 192-channel, 1.2km-long hydrophone streamer.\nIn the time-migrated reflection section, variation in the sedimentary layer and basement reflection can be recognized off Shikoku, which may correspond with the boundary of the plate age proposed by magnetic lineation [Okino et al., 1999]. In the southwestern part of the profile, the basement reflection is not always clear, and shows smooth structure. Comparatively in the northeastern part, basement changes in depth drastically with prominent reflection signals. In the wide-angle OBS data, PS converted waves are clearly observed over along the seismic profile. In particular, PS converted waves refracted from the uppermost mantle can be remarkably recognized in the northeastern half of the profile.\nWe will show the structural variation of the oceanic crust of the incoming plate, which may be related to the formation of the Shikoku Basin as well as the generation of the various seismic activities including the low-frequency events, by using OBS data.\nThis study is part of ‘Research project for compound disaster mitigation on the great earthquakes and tsunamis around the Nankai Trough region’ funded by MEXT, Japan.",

            "abstract": "Mesoscale oceanic structure and variability are required to be reproduced as accurately as possible in realistic regional ocean modeling. Uchiyama et al. (2012) demonstrated with a submesoscale eddy-resolving JCOPE2-ROMS downscaling oceanic modeling system that the mesoscale reproducibility of the Kuroshio meandering along Japan is significantly improved by introducing a simple restoration to data which we call “TS nudging” (a.k.a. robust diagnosis) where the prognostic temperature and salinity fields are weakly nudged four-dimensionally towards the assimilative JCOPE2 reanalysis (Miyazawa et al., 2009). However, there is not always a reliable reanalysis for oceanic downscaling in an arbitrary region and at an arbitrary time, and therefore alternative dataset should be prepared. Takano et al. (2009) proposed an empirical method to estimate mesoscale 3-D thermal structure from the near real-time AVISO altimetry data along with the ARGO float data based on the two-layer model of Goni et al. (1996). In the present study, we consider the TS data derived from this method as a candidate. We thus conduct a synoptic forward modeling of the Kuroshio using the JCOPE2-ROMS downscaling system to explore potential utility of this empirical TS dataset (hereinafter TUM-TS) by carrying out two runs with the T-S nudging towards 1) the JCOPE2-TS and 2) TUM-TS fields.　An example of the comparison between the two ROMS test runs is shown in the attached figure showing the annually averaged surface EKE. Both of TUM-TS and JCOPE2-TS are found to help reproducing the mesoscale variance of the Koroshio and its extension as well as its mean paths, surface KE and EKE reasonably well. Therefore, the AVISO-ARGO derived empirical 3-D TS estimation is potentially exploitable for the dataset to conduct the T-S nudging to reproduce mesoscale oceanic structure.",

Three participatory modeling workshops were held in the RSB in spring 2013. A model of the water resources system, consisting of a watershed hydrology model, a model of the water infrastructure, and groundwater models, was developed deliberatively in the workshops, along with scenarios of future climate and development. Participants were asked to design water resources management strategies by choosing from a range of supply augmentation and demand reduction measures associated with water conservation. Participants assessed water supply reliability, measured as the average daily supply divided by daily demand for historical and future periods, by probing with the climate and development scenarios.\nPre- and post-workshop-surveys were developed and administered, based on conceptual models of workshop participants’ beliefs regarding modeling and local water resources. The survey results indicate that participants believed their modeling abilities increased and beliefs in the utility of models increased as a result of the workshops. The selected water resources strategies varied widely among participants. Wastewater reuse for industry and aquifer recharge were popular options, but significant numbers of participants thought that inter-basin transfers and desalination were viable. The majority of participants indicated that substantial increases in agricultural water efficiency could be achieved. On average, participants chose strategies that produce reliabilities over the historical and future periods of 95%, but more than 20% of participants were apparently satisfied with reliabilities lower than 80%. The wide range of strategies chosen and associated reliabilities indicate that there is a substantial degree of uncertainty in how future water resources decisions could be made in the region.",

            "abstract": "Accurate seismic event locations are needed to delineate roles of mine geometry, stress and geologic structures in developing rockburst conditions. Accurate absolute locations are challenging in mine environments with rapid changes in seismic velocity due to sharp contrasts between individual layers and large time-dependent velocity gradients attending excavations. Periodic use of controlled seismic sources can help constrain the velocity in this continually evolving propagation medium comprising the miners’ workplace. With a view to constructing realistic velocity models in environments in which use of explosives is problematic, a seismic source was developed subject to the following design constraints: (i) suitable for use in highly disturbed zones surrounding mine openings, (ii) able to produce usable signals over km-scale distances in the frequency range of typical coal mine seismic events (~10-100 Hz), (iii) repeatable, (iv) portable, (v) non-disruptive to mining operations, and (vi) safe for use in potentially explosive gaseous environments. Designs of the compressed load column seismic source (CLCSS), which generates a stress, or load, drop normal to the surface of mine openings, and the fiber-optic based source-initiation timer are presented. Tests were conducted in a coal mine at a depth of 500 m (1700 ft) and signals were recorded on the surface with a 72-ch (14 Hz) exploration seismograph for load drops of 150-470 kN (16-48 tons). Signal-to-noise ratios of unfiltered signals ranged from ~200 immediately above the source (500 m (1700 ft)) to ~8 at the farthest extent of the array (slant distance of ~800 m (2600 ft)), suggesting the potential for use over longer range. Results are compared with signals produced by weight drop and sledge hammer sources, indicating the superior waveform quality for first-arrival measurements with the CLCSS seismic source.",

According to statistics of the monitoring program of drinking water sources in 309 at or above prefecture level of China in 2013, the major pollutants index were total phosphorus, ammonia and manganese in surface drinking water sources, respectively, iron, ammonia and manganese in groundwater drinking water sources, respectively. More than 150 drinking water emergency environmental accidents happened since 2006, 52 of these accidents led to the disruption of water supply in waterworks, and a population of over ten million were affected. It indicated that there is a potential risk for people’s health by the use of river water directly and it is necessary to require alternative techniques such as riverbank filtration for improving the drinking water quality. Riverbank filtration is an inexpensive natural process, not only smoothing out normal pollutant concentration found in surface water but also significantly reducing the risk from such emergency events as chemical spill into the river. Riverbank filtration technique has been used in many countries more than 100 years, including China. In China, in 1950s, the bank infiltration technique was first applied in northeast of China. Extensive bank infiltration application was conducted in 1980s, and more than 300 drinking water sources utilities bank infiltration established mainly near the Songhua River Basin, the Yellow River Basin, Haihe River Basin. However, the comparative lack of application and researches on riverbank filtration have formed critical scientific data gap in China. As the performance of riverbank filtration technique depend on not only the design and setting such as well type, pumping rate, but also the local hydrogeology and environmental properties. We recommend more riverbank filtration project and studies to be conducted to collect related significant environmental geology data in China. Additionally, the experience has demonstrated a number of water quality improvements associated with riverbank filtration. It is important to stress that the fate and behavior of emerging organic contaminants during riverbank filtration should be taken into special consideration.",

            "abstract": "The origin of K-rich orogenic magmatism in the Alpine-Himalayan belt and its relationship to the large-scale elevations in several massifs of the orogen is controversial, particularly the significance of the widespread presence of a geochemical signal typical for recycled continental crust. Two competing scenarios invoke direct melting of continental crust during deep intercontinental subduction and removal of heavily metasomatised mantle lithosphere by delamination into the convecting mantle. Here we investigate the coupling of high Th/La ratio with crustal isotopic signatures in K-rich orogenic lavas that does not occur in volcanic rocks from other collisional environments to distinguish between these two models. High-pressure experimental results on a phyllite representing upper crustal composition and a detailed mineral and geochemical study of blueschists from Tavşanlı mélange, Turkey, indicate that this geochemical fingerprint originates by melting of subducted mélange. Melting of crust at the top of the subducted continental lithosphere cannot produce observed fingerprint, whereas lawsonites, especially those with terrigenous sediment origin from blueschists with high Th/La can. Lawsonites that grow in various components of a subduction mélange inherit the geochemical characteristics of either oceanic or continental protoliths. It is currently uncertain whether those carrying the high Th/La signature originate by direct melting of continental blocks in the mélange or by the introduction of supercritical fluids from lawsonite blueschist of continental origin that infiltrate oceanic sediment blocks. Either way, the high Th/La is later released into subsequently formed melts. This confirms the supposition that lawsonite is the main progenitor of the high Th/La and Sm/La ratio. However, lawsonite must break down completely to impart this unique feature to subsequent magmas. The source regions of the potassic volcanic rocks consist of blueschist facies mélanges imbricated together with extremely depleted fore-arc peridotites in a mantle lithosphere that was newly formed during the convergence of small continental blocks and oceans. This process takes place entirely at shallow depths (<60-80km) and does not require any deep subduction of continental materials.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection is the magnetosphere is characterized by the complex interplay of microscopic and macroscopic scale: processes originating at the electron scales may eventually produce noticeable effects at the macroscopic scales also. A suitable example is the acceleration of electron jets to electron Alfvén speed in the inner Electron Diffusion Region (EDR) (Drake08): the accelerated electrons then evolve into an outer EDR with length of the order of the ion skin depth (Karimabadi07).\nThis same example highlights the challenges entailed in numerical simulations of magnetic reconnection. Large domains have to be simulated to appreciate the large scale reconnection dynamics, but at the same time electron scale resolution has to be used, at least locally, to allow microscale processes to develop. This dramatically increases the computational costs of simulations, especially if a realistic mass ratio between the particle species is used. \nWe show here simulations of large domain magnetic reconnection processes with electron scale resolution. These simulations are made possible at a moderate computational cost by the use of the newly developed semi-implicit Multi Level Multi Domain method (Innocenti13, Beck13), which combines the advantages of implicit algorithms (Vu92) and adaptivity. \nWith the MLMD method, a domain larger than the Ion Diffusion Region is simulated with realistic mass ratio and with ion scale resolution. The EDR is then simulated also with higher spatial and temporal resolution, to allow electron scale, faster processes to develop there. Since electron scale resolution is used only in a small part of the total domain, the computational cost of MLMD simulations is dramatically lowered with respect to fully resolved simulations. Comparable levels of physical details is delivered (Innocenti14, submitted). To prove this, we show here that the MLMD method can capture characteristic EDR electron scale processes such as the formation of an inversion layer in the Hall electric field (Chen11) and the already mentioned acceleration of electron jets departing from the EDR to velocities of the order of the electron Alfvén speed vA,e ≈vA √mr, where vA is the Alfvén speed and mr the mass ratio.",

            "abstract": "This presentation reviews the pressures, threats and risks to food availability and water based on projected global population growth to 2050. An original model, the Global Food and Water System (GWFS) Platform, is introduced and used to explore food deficits under various scenarios and also the implications for future water gaps. The GWFS platform can assess the effects of crop productivity on food production and incorporates data from 19 major food producing nations to generate a global projection of food and water gaps. Preliminary results indicate that while crop food supply is able to meet global crop food demand by 2050, this is possible only with ‘input intensification’ that includes increased average rates of water and fertiliser use per hectare and at least a 20% increase in average yield productivity (once and for all). Increased water withdrawals for agriculture with input intensification would, absent any increases in withdrawals in the manufacturing or household uses, would place the world very close to the limits of a safe operating space in terms overall water use by 2050. While global crop food supply can meet projected global demand with input intensification, this still results in large and growing crop food deficits to 2050 in some countries, especially in South Asia, where climate change is expected to increase variability of rainfall and, in some places, reduce overall freshwater availability. While beyond the confines of the GWFS Platform the implications of expected water withdrawals on the environment in particular locations are also briefly reviewed.",

            "abstract": "Operational geothermal fields typically have high seismicity rates, which could be caused by both tectonic and anthropogenic activities. Due to the high background seismicity and possible interaction between fluid and seismic waves, geothermal areas have been recognized to be susceptible to large remote earthquakes. However, whether human activity (geothermal production) affects remote earthquake triggering by changing the stress state is unclear. Here we choose two geothermal fields, Coso and Salton Sea in southern California, to study the spatiotemporal distributions of the triggered earthquakes following the 1992 Mw 7.3 Landers and 1999 Mw 7.1 Hector Mine earthquakes. These two geothermal fields have been in operation since 1980s with comparable net capacity, and have long-term geothermal fluid loss. By analyzing the regional catalog recorded by the Southern California Seismic Network, we find that these two operational geothermal areas remain unaffected by the remote mainshocks, whereas the surrounding areas show vigorous triggered responses. We interpret this phenomenon as a result of human activity, which presumably has brought the stress state away from failure by reducing pore pressure. To further understand how much the human activity can affect the stress state, we also conduct a systematic study on Long Valley Caldera in northern California as a comparison site. Long Valley Caldera hosts an active geothermal field with net capacity about one sixth of that in Coso or Salton Sea geothermal field, and the extraction volume is not constantly larger than the injection. We will show comparisons of the triggered response in Long Valley with the two geothermal fields in southern California.",

We developed a similar algorithm for computing short period synthetic ScP seismograms based on the representation theorem and ray theory. We then explore the quantitative relationships between the synthetic ScP seismograms’ amplitude variation and CMB topography depression or jump, and compare the synthetics with array observations of ScP data. We will discuss the algorithm’s limitation and possible extension so that it may work in more complicated mantle structures.",

            "abstract": "Arctic permafrost represents about 50% of the total belowground global carbon pool, and thus the fate of this pool, as it thaws in the wake of global warming, warrants close attention. Large-river delta-front estuaries (LDEs) have been shown to be important recorders of natural and human-induced changes in watersheds, as they are critical zones for the exchange of organic carbon between the continents and the ocean. The Colville River is the largest North American Arctic River with a continuous permafrost watershed. Simpson’s Lagoon, an eastward distal component of the Colville River Delta is an excellent location for historical reconstruction work since it is an area well protected from intense ice grounding and has minimal bioturbation. Sediment cores were collected from the mouth of the river and the lagoon in August of 2010, and analyzed for bulk organic carbon and nitrogen proxies, biomarkers (including lignin phenols, fatty acids), and compound-specific 13C isotope analysis (CSIA) of fatty acids. Downcore sediment data from CSIA of short-chain fatty acids (C14-C18) to the delta over the past ca. 50 years were found to be more depleted and had a wider isotopic range (-17.0~-33.2‰) than long-chain fatty acids (C22-C30, -30.3~-36.8‰). This possibly reflects alterations of inputs of freshwater flow to the delta which could have resulted in isotopic changes that caused corresponding changes in marine versus freshwater phytoplankton inputs. Downcore short-chain saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid profiles reflected differences in the abundance of bacteria and post-depositional decay of algal inputs across different regions of the delta. Ongoing analyses will also focus on compound-specific radiocarbon analyses (CSRA) of fatty acids and lignin phenols to better understand the changes of organic inputs from terrestrially-derived organic-rich horizons in surface soils vs. old deep permafrost-derived organic horizons.",

            "abstract": "Reliable and accurate focal depth of moderate size earthquakes (Mw5.5-Mw7) is important in many aspects of seismological studies, such as mapping the thermal-mechanical fault structure variation and revealing depth-dependent plate tectonics process. Identification of teleseismic depth phase (e.g. pP and sP) is usually performed to determine focal depth. However, as for shallow events, a relatively long source rupture duration may cause waveform interference to picking of depth phase. Fortunately, both long period teleseismic body-wave and Rayleigh wave spectral amplitude are sensitive to variation of centroid depth. In order to combine depth phase signals in teleseismic body-wave and broadband frequency information in Rayleigh wave’s spectral amplitude, we propose a new joint inversion method performed using grid search for centroid depth. Because of the increased global coverage of seismometer networks and relatively high signal-to-noise ratio of teleseismic recording, firstly, focal mechanism is determined based on Cut-and-Paste method of teleseismic body-wave. Then an optimal centroid depth is inverted to best fit observed teleseismic body-wave and regional Rayleigh wave spectral amplitude. Application of this joint method to several well studied moderate size earthquakes verify not only robustness of the method, but also quantitatively improved accuracy of estimates of centroid depth.",

            "abstract": "St. Paul Island, AK, part of the Pribilofs, is an island remnant of the Bering Land Bridge, a possible coastal Picea refugium at the last glacial maximum, and a Holocene refugium for Mammuthus primigenius. A prior pollen record from Lake Hill indicates that St. Paul was predominantly herb tundra during the last glacial maximum followed by a shrub tundra in the early Holocene (Colinvaux, 1980). Subsequently, three radiocarbon dates on bones from Qagnax Cave indicate a last appearance of Mammuthus primigenius of 6.5 ka on St. Paul (Veltre et al. 2008). In March 2013, our team retrieved a 13.5 m composite core from Lake Hill to refine the extinction timing chronology, assess environmental change during the extinction interval, and test hypotheses about vegetation-megafauna feedback. This paper reports the results from modern botanical survey and analyses of fossil pollen, Sporormiella and other coprophilous spores, anchored by a new radiocarbon chronology consisting of seven AMS dates. Presently, bryophytes, Equisetum, Poaceae, Juncaceae, Salix and Viola commonly occur at the lake margin, accompanied increasingly by sedge meadow taxa with greater distance from the water’s edge, especially Cyperaceae, Asteraceae, Apiaceae, Lupinus, Rubus and Valeriana. Sporormiella is consistently present in low abundances (2%, ~700 grains/cm3) in the late glacial and early Holocene until a drop to zero at 6,050 yr BP, remaining absent during the middle and late Holocene when it reappears at 1904 AD. The timing of Sporormiella decline and reappearance match well to the youngest mammoth bone date and the historic reintroduction of reindeer (1911 AD) on St. Paul Island. After 11 ka, major pollen types include Apiaceae, Poaceae, Cyperaceae, Artemisia and Salix, with lower abundances of Betula, Alnus and Ericaceae, consistent with herb tundra with some shrubs. Degraded Picea pollen grains are found at 12,240 yr BP in very low concentrations (223 grains/cm3), indicating long-distance deposition from a distal source with no local refugium. Declines in Apiaceae and Poaceae, and increases in Artemisia and Salix between 8014 and 7605 yr BP suggest a gradual increase prevalence of shrub tundra. The establishment of shrub tundra precedes the Sporormiella decline, suggesting this vegetation change was not caused by the megafaunal extinction.",

One-dimensional shear-wave velocity (Vs) structure beneath the OTVZ seismic station near the volcano was inferred by the genetic algorithm (GA) inversion of radial receiver functions (RFs). Radial RFs were derived from 337 teleseismic events (Mw ≥ 5.5 and epicentral distances between 30° and 90°) recorded by a broad-band seismometer at the seismic station during the period from November 11, 2011 to September 11, 2013. Among the derived RFs, only 87 RFs with higher signal to noise ratios were used for the GA inversion method. Three hundred velocity models for 100 generations were derived using velocity models comprising 32 layers with a maximum depth of 60 km. The inverted models were averaged to obtain the final Vs model, which indicates a clear discontinuity at a depth of 18±1 km where Vs abruptly increases from 3.1 to 4.0 km/s. Above the sharp Vs discontinuity indicating the Moho, an average Vs is 2.8 km/s. Low-velocity layers (LVLs) are identified at depths of 10-16 km in the lower crust (Vs < 3.0 km/s) and 28-40 km in the upper mantle (Vs < 4.4 km/s). Corresponding average Vs are 2.8 and 4.2 km/s, respectively. The thin crust with relatively low velocities and existence of LVLs in the lower crust and upper mantle allude to the presence of magma associated with the subducting Pacific Plate. The limited number of teleseismic events recorded at the OTVZ station prevents from further investigation into the effect of RFs of dipping boundaries and anisotropy.",

The VOCs including acetonitrile, aldehydes/ketones, furan, and aromatic hydrocarbons were monitored by proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry. Two samples, wheat straw and rape plant, were burned in dry conditions and for some experiments wheat straw was burned under wet conditions. We compared the present data to the field data reported by Kudo et al. [2014]. The agreement between the field and laboratory data was obtained for aromatics for relatively more smoldering data of dry samples but the field data were slightly underestimated compared with the laboratory data for oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) and acetonitrile. When the EFs from the burning of wet samples were investigated, the underestimations for OVOCs and acetonitrile were improved compared with the data of dry samples. It may be a property of the burning of crop residue in the region of high temperature and high humidity that some inside parts of piled crop residue and/or the crop residue facing on the ground are still wet. But the ratios for acetic acid/glycolaldehyde was still lower than 1. This may suggest that strong loss processes of acetic acid/glycolaldehyde are present in the fresh plume.\nKudo S., H.

            "abstract": "The characteristics and causes of interannual-decadal sea surface temperature (SST) variability in the Southern Ocean are investigated within the simulations of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 and 5 (CMIP3 and CMIP5) data base and in idealized forced ocean general circulation model simulations. We will compare the leading modes of SST variability against several simple null hypotheses, such as isotropic diffusion (red noise) and a Slab Ocean model, to investigate the sources of decadal variability. In this we will show that characteristic multi-decadal variability patterns exist in the Southern Ocean that are beyond a simple red noise. The results show that the atmospheric forcing not only affects the SST modes on shorter time-scales directly, but also show its influence on longer time scales via air-sea interaction and oceanic feedback. The deep mixed layer in the Southern Ocean is an essential element to maintain the long-term SST variability while the ocean dynamics connect the entire ocean and create the homogeneous-like spatial patterns via advection effect.",

            "abstract": "HIMU is one of mantle components that has been recognized to form by subduction and subsequent storage of ancient oceanic crust in the mantle. We use noble gas and Pb isotopic compositions of HIMU basalts to constrain age of reservoir formation and recycling of K, U, and Th. It has been confirmed that subaerial and submarine Austral Islands HIMU basalts show low 3He/4He relative to MORB, indicating the HIMU reservoir involving either U-enriched or He-depleted material. Moreover, fractionation-corrected 4He/40Ar* of the HIMU basalts is higher than the 4He/40Ar* production ratio in the mantle. This suggests that K/U of the HIMU component converted from 4He/40Ar* is approximately 3000, and hence lower than the canonical mantle K/U of 13000. These facts are best explained by a model that the HIMU component originates from subducted oceanic crust that preferentially lost He and K relative to U and Th during subduction.\nThe St. Helena HIMU basalts in the Atlantic show systematically higher 207Pb/204Pb for a given 206Pb/204Pb than the Austral Islands HIMU basalts in the Pacific. The Pb isotope evolution model suggests that both HIMU components formed around 2 Ga; however, the HIMU component beneath Atlantic is about 0.3 Ga older than that beneath Pacific. We interpret the age difference as that the HIMU reservoir for St. Helena involved old subducted materials more abundant than that for Austral Islands during the long-term accumulation of subducted materials. Using the same Pb evolution model, Th/U deduced from the 206Pb/204Pb–208Pb/204Pb relationship (3.3-3.7) is higher than that of present-day altered MORB (<2), Th/U of which is lowered by addition of U from oxic hydrothermal fluids. This suggests that either the HIMU precursor was fresh MORB, or more likely, hydrothermally altered MORB with minimal U enrichment in the less oxic environment in the Archean or early Proterozoic.",

            "abstract": "Continental collision between the Indian and the Eurasian plates resulted in uplift of the Tibetan plateau and the thickening of the crust. A lot of work has been done on the crust structures beneath Tibet, and several tectonic models are proposed to explain the mechanism of the uplift and thickening. But due to the absence of the upper mantle structures, those models are still under debate. Fine upper mantle velocity and anisotropy structures can help us understand the dynamic process of the Tibetan plateau. Waveform modeling of upper mantle triplication phases can provide a good vertical resolution of upper mantle velocity structures, but present methods for calculating synthetic seismograms cannot process anisotropic media. We develop a method based on the generalized reflection and transmission method (GRTM) to calculate synthetic seismograms for wave propagating in stratified VTI media, so we can waveform model upper mantle triplications propagating in anisotropic media. In this study, we waveform model the tangential and radial seismic triplication data recorded in Chinese digital seismic stations at a epicentral distance of 10-30 degree for one events occurring in middle Tibet to constrain fine upper mantle velocity and anisotropy structures beneath eastern Tibet. The result shows that horizontal S wave velocity is larger than vertical S wave velocity in the upper mantle beneath eastern Tibet. We also build a mineral physics modeling method, which can calculate upper mantle anisotropy structures based on mantle temperatures, compositions and directions of mantle flow, and use this method to explore compositional and dynamic models that would explain the inferred seismic structures. The results suggest that in our sampling region, the water content is lower than 0.4 wt%, and there is vertical mantle flow beneath the lithospheric lid.",

            "abstract": "During the dry season in Central Brazil and Southern Amazon, there is an usually high concentration of aerosol particles associated with intense human activities, with extensive biomass burning. It has been observed through remote sensing that the smoke clouds in these areas often cover an area of about 4 to 5 million km2. Thus, the average aerosol optical depth of these regions at 500 ηm, is usually below 0.1 during the rainy season and can exceed 0.9 in the fire season. Aerosol particles act as condensation nuclei and also increase scattering and absorption of the incident radiation. Therefore, the layer of the aerosol alters the precipitation rate; reduces the amount of solar energy that reaches the surface, producing a cooling; and causes an increase of diffuse radiation. These factors directly and indirectly affect the CO2 fluxes at the surface. In this work, the chemical-atmospheric model CCATT-BRAMS (Coupled Chemistry-Aerosol-Tracer Transport model to the Brazilian developments on the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System) coupled to the surface model JULES (Joint UK Land Environment Simulator) was used to simulate the effects of biomass burning aerosols in CO2 fluxes in the Amazon region. Both the total effect of the aerosols and the contribution related only to the increase of the diffuse fraction caused by the their presence were analyzed. The results show that the effect of the scattered fraction is dominant over all other effects. It was also noted that the presence of aerosols from fires can substantially change biophysiological processes of the carbon cycle. In some situations, it can lead to a sign change in the net ecosystem exchange (NEE), turning it from a source of CO2 to the atmosphere, when the aerosol is not considered in the simulations, to a sink, when it is considered. Thus, this work demonstrates the importance of considering the presence of aerosols in numerical simulations of weather and climate, since carbon dioxide is a major greenhouse gas.",

            "abstract": "Compared with the explosive source conventionally used in seismic exploration, a key feature of vibrator seismic exploration method is that the instantaneous energy input to the underground and destructive are both small, and it is more susceptible by the instantaneous pulse noise in the background and the internal vibrator system (such as electromagnetic noise, shaking noise, etc.). After studied the impact of the pulse noise in the vibrator data, it had been found that the signals could be completely overwhelmed when 1.43% of non-correlated vibrator data is the pulse noise and average intensity is 200. Since the impact of the pulse noise on seismic records is different between vibrator and explosive source. It is difficult to use conventional pulse noise suppression method to suppress the interference of pulse noise of vibrator records. Based on the amplitude difference between the valid signal and the pulse noise in non-related record, this paper presents a method of the Suppression of Pulse Noise in the Pre-correlated Domain (SPNPD). The method is applied to the pulse noise of the synthetic data and the field record, and the result indicated that the proposed method could effectively suppress the pulse noise and improve the quality of vibrator record.",

To maintain an overall fine service including improving serving our users with advanced data services has been our primary goal. We are developing an advanced science/event-based data service framework. The framework aims to effectively provide users with a sophisticatedly integrated data package via user-friendly discovering and selecting a system-preset science/event topic (e.g., hurricane, volcano, etc.) from an in-developing knowledge database of the framework. A data recipe page related to the Hurricane topic has been developed to demo the concept. More showcases of various subjects such as Volcano, Dust Storm, and Forest Fire are also under development. This framework is in developing on top of existing data services at GES DISC, such as Mirador (data search engine), Giovanni (visualization), OPeNDAP, and data recipes. It also involves other data tools, such as Panoply, GrADS, IDL, etc. The Hurricane Sandy (Oct 22-31 2012) event is used here for a sample description. As Hurricane Sandy being selected as a user case, a table containing nine system-preset data variables (i.e., precipitation, winds, sea surface temperature, sea level pressure, air temperature, relative humidity, aerosols, soil moisture and surface runoff, and trace gases) linked to the respective data products with fine temporal and spatial resolutions from various in-house sources is provided. The “bundled” variable data can thus be readily downloaded through Mirador. The in-house Giovanni is accessible for users to acquire quick views of Level 3 (gridded) variables. For Level 2 (swath) or the Giovanni-unavailable Level 3 data, the system provides a link to data recipes that give a how-to guide to read and visualize the data using offline tools, such as Panoply, GrADS, or IDL.",

            "abstract": "Vast literature on Babcock-Leighton flux-transport dynamo models indicate that the sunspot activity cycles in the Northern and Southern hemispheres are primarily decoupled about the equator and are independent of each other. However, we find from the analysis of long-term sunspot area data from 1875 to 2013 that the two hemispheres continuously attempt to couple about the equator. If we define the coupling line as the line where the sunspot area of the two hemispheres is the same on the plot of North versus South spot-area, we find that the two hemispheres' spot-area tend to fall on the coupling line over a very long period of time, despite their short-term traversal away from the coupling line. This indicates that there must be some underlying process inside the Sun's interior which is causing this coupling. Further analysis of the features, such as rise and decay times of solar cycles, minima and peak amplitudes, reveal that the solar cycles normally follow a saw-tooth pattern with a fast rise and slow fall, as noted before. Most interestingly, we find that rise-time in one hemisphere correlates with minima-amplitude of the other hemisphere, but anti-correlates with that of the same hemisphere. We speculate that this happens because the fast rise of a cycle can annihilate the opposite-hemisphere's flux faster, leading to a lower minima-amplitude. By contrast, the peak of a cycle does not have much influence on minima-amplitude of the opposite hemisphere. We are investigating the physics behind these features through dynamo simulations.",

            "abstract": "It has been widely accepted that diffuse auroras are generated by electron precipitations in the energy range from a few keV to tens keV. Recent simulation results based on the quasi-linear theory showed that the scattering by whistler-mode waves plays an important role in the production of precipitating electrons responsible for diffuse auroras. A test particle simulation on electron-whistler interactions shows that relativistic electrons can be scattered into the loss cone simultaneously with the electrons in the energy range from a few keV to tens keV. Thus, it is expected that relativistic electrons precipitate into the atmosphere in association with diffuse auroras if whistler-mode waves contribute to generation of diffuse auroras. To examine this hypothesis, we investigated conjugate observations of SAMPEX and the all sky camera at Syowa Station on the dawn side, where diffuse auroras are frequently observed. In this study, we show a case study that relativistic electron (> 1 MeV) precipitations observed by SAMPEX are associated with the diffuse aurora observed at Syowa Station. The SAMPEX observation shows that the enhancement of precipitating relativistic electrons is well correlated with that of precipitating > 150 keV and > 400 keV electrons, indicating that electrons in the energy range from a few keV to > 1 MeV precipitate into the atmosphere simultaneously in association with the diffuse aurora. It is observational evidence that whistler mode waves contribute to generation of diffuse auroras.",

            "abstract": "Inland water level variation widely exists but is usually neglected when conducting research on flow and solute transport in coastal aquifers. A numerical model considering variable-saturation and variable-density based on FEFLOW was used to investigate the influence of inland groundwater level oscillation on groundwater dynamics and land-sourced solute migration in a subterranean estuary over a period of two years. Results show that groundwater level fluctuation induced by water level change at the inland boundary decays linearly seaward but that induced by tidal fluctuation decays exponentially landward. The size of the upper saline plume fluctuates with the inland groundwater level oscillation and the size of the largest USP is more than two times that of the smallest. The largest and the smallest USPs are observed about 25 and 45 days after the lowest and highest inland groundwater level respectively for the parameters and aquifer configuration used in this study. The seawater wedge-freshwater interface shows a rotated movement in response to groundwater level oscillation at inland boundary because its upper part is controlled by the USP movement. Considering that the relatively large horizontal velocity exists in coastal aquifers, a modified Rayleigh number is used to investigate the density-induced unstable phenomenon involving in solute transport in a subterranean estuary. A high Rayleigh number indicates the onset of instability. Fingers and freshwater protuberance are observed in both cases with and without inland groundwater level oscillation. Due to small seaward hydraulic gradient, a high Rayleigh number is reached at the low inland groundwater level, resulting in a long finger plume and high freshwater protuberance morphology. Because of mechanical dispersion induced by the large horizontal velocity when groundwater level is high at the inland boundary, the finger plume and freshwater protuberance well mixes. Consequently, the high concentration plumes will be diluted when migrating toward the sea. Sensitive analysis indicates that the USP and land-sourced solute plume are sensitive to hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer, amplitude of the groundwater level oscillation at the inland boundary and density of the land-sourced solute.",

            "abstract": "Radiocarbon (14C) analysis of planktic foraminiferal calcite is widely used to study ocean-climate change over the past ~40 ka of Earth history. However, it is well known that planktic shell calcite typically yields 14C ages ~400 years older than those of bulk carbonate from the same sample. Such age discrepancies are problematic, and have been attributed to size-selective sediment mixing and/or differential dissolution of planktic shells within the sedimentary bioturbated zone. Another likely cause of such temporal offsets is the addition of secondary calcite to planktic shells via post-depositional diagenesis, but quantifying the deleterious effects of diagenesis on foraminiferal 14C ages has proven difficult owing to a paucity of suitable study materials. We address this problem by comparing 14C ages and δ13C values of planktic shells exhibiting a state of preservation (frosty) traditionally deemed acceptable for paleoceanographic studies to those of extremely well preserved (glassy) shells. Aliquots of frosty and glassy shells (>150 mm) of mixed-layer species (Globigerinoides ruber, Gs. sacculifer, Orbulina universa) were picked separately from a stratigraphic series of clay-rich samples recovered in a piston core taken atop Blake Ridge (northwestern Atlantic Ocean). Sample selection was guided by a foraminiferal δ18O record, which constrained the Last Glacial Maximum to ~100 cm core depth. Results support a diagenetic mechanism as glassy shells yield 14C ages that average ~2,000 ± 100 years younger than frosty shells from the same samples. Further, average δ13C of glassy shells is 0.6 ± 0.1‰ lower than that of frosty shells. Our findings indicate that 14C ages are artificially elevated by the dissolution of previously deposited (“old”) carbonate and its subsequent reprecipitation as secondary carbonate on younger foraminiferal shells at, and beneath, the seafloor – a phenomenon that has not been quantified prior to this study.",

            "abstract": "The depth extent of seismic rupture in oceanic lithosphere is thought to be limited by the 600º to 800ºC isotherm with the thermal structure generally characterized by a half-space cooling model. However, previous studies constraining this limit represent a limited number of individual faults and earthquakes and use a wide range of different methods. Observations of significantly deep slip at the 800ºC isotherm, supershear rupture velocities, and along-strike differences in seismic slip have been made for oceanic strike slip earthquakes (McGuire and Beroza, 2012; Yue et al., 2013; McGuire et al., 2012). To examine how seismic rupture is controlled, we look at a variety of earthquakes in different settings using the same method of finite fault modeling. We choose the largest and best recorded oceanic strike-slip earthquakes from tectonic settings of interplate transform, intraplate fracture zones, and strike-slip plate boundaries. These earthquakes are located in the Indian Ocean, near the South Sandwich Islands, on the edge of the Scotia Plate, off the coast of Alaska, and west of Australia, rupturing lithosphere with ages from 0 to 70 My. We first determine first motion and point source mechanisms from the first arriving P waves and later arriving pP, sP, and SH waves. Using the nodal planes of these mechanisms, we perform finite fault modeling at a range of constant rupture velocities and hypocenter depths. We determine which slip asperities are well-constrained by limiting the extent of the preferred model until the fit to the data is affected significantly. The rupture directivity, rupture speed, depth extent of slip, and along-strike distribution of slip is then compared between events to identify relationships to the tectonic setting, thermal structure inferred from lithospheric age, or other possible mechanisms for controlling slip. These strike-slip earthquakes also provide examples of rupture along a bimaterial fault plane, which have been shown to have a relationship between stress loading direction, rupture directivity, and rupture speed by previous studies. The results of this study will determine seismic slip distribution in the relatively simple structure of oceanic lithosphere, and provide a comparison for the more complex structure of continental strike-slip faults.",

            "abstract": "Site characteristics are an important factor in earthquake hazard assessment. To better understand site response differences on a small scale, as well as the seismic hazard of the area, we develop site response parameter maps of Cal Poly Pomona campus. Cal Poly Pomona is located in southern California about 40 km east of Los Angeles, within 50 km of San Andreas Fault. The campus is situated on top of the San Jose Fault. With about twenty two thousand students on campus, it is important to know the site response in this area. To this end, we apply the Horizontal-to-Vertical (H/V) spectral ratio technique, which is an empirical method that can be used in an urban environment with no environmental impact. This well-established method is based on the computation of the ratio of vertical ambient noise ground motion over horizontal ambient noise ground motion as a function of frequency. By applying the spectral ratio method and the criteria from Site Effects Assessment Using Ambient Excitations (SESAME) guidelines, we can determine fundamental frequency and a minimum site amplification factor. We installed broadband seismometers throughout the Cal Poly Pomona campus, with an initial number of about 15 sites. The sites are approximately 50 to 150 meters apart and about two hours of waveforms were recorded at each site. We used the Geopsy software to make measurements of the peak frequency and the amplitude of the main peak from the spectral ratio. These two parameters have been determined to be estimates of fundamental frequency and a minimum site amplification factor, respectively. Based on the geological map from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and our data collected from Cal Poly Pomona campus, our preliminary results suggest that the area of campus that is covered by alluvial fan material tends to have a single significant spectral peak with a fundamental frequency of ~1Hz and a minimum amplification factor of ~3.7. The minimum depth of the surface layer is about 56 meters, as determined from the peak frequency and an estimate of the local shear wave velocity. We will present two preliminary site response parameter maps: one for fundamental frequency and one for minimum site amplification factor.",

            "abstract": "Ice core records show that atmospheric CO2 concentrations during peak glacial time were ~30% lower than the levels during interglacial periods. The terrestrial biosphere carbon stock was likely reduced during glacials. Increased carbon storage in the deep ocean is thought to play an important role in lowering glacial atmospheric CO2. However, it has been challenging to quantify carbon storage changes in the deep ocean using existing proxy data. Here, we present deepwater carbonate ion reconstructions for a few locations in the deep Atlantic. These data allow us to estimate the minimum carbon storage increase in the deep Atlantic Ocean during the last glaciation. Our results show that, despite its relative small volume, the deep Atlantic Ocean may contribute significantly to atmospheric CO2 variations at major climate transitions. Furthermore, our results suggest a strong coupling of ocean circulation and carbon cycle in the deep Atlantic during the last glaciation.",

            "abstract": "During the last two decades, there have been numerous studies using remote sensing to study catchment energy and water balance. A well-known example is the combination of surface temperature (Ts) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which can provide information on vegetation and moisture conditions at the land surface. Since the soil moisture is a key variable in hydrological modeling, this information is potentially useful in large watersheds and remote areas in developing countries, where little infrastructure and few resources still make continuous in-situ monitoring of environmental variables a difficult task, as well as in semi arid areas, where the lack of water may represent an obstacle to the regional economic and sustainable development. The basic methodology is to calculate soil moisture indexes by the scatter plots of NDVI and Ts and to analyze the Ts/NDVI slope, in order to estimate temporal patterns of soil moisture. We will utilize the standard vegetation index and surface temperature products from MODIS and NOAA – AVHRR, and the results will be compared with soil moisture derived from a hydrological model (Soil Moisture Accounting Procedure). This work will focus on a 18200 km² semi-arid catchment in Northeastern Brazil.",

This approach has been used previously to constrain emissions of isoprene from vegetation, but application to US anthropogenic emissions has been stymied by lack of a discernable HCHO signal. Here we show that oversampling of HCHO data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) for 2005–2008 enables quantitative detection of urban and industrial plumes in eastern Texas including Houston, Port Arthur, and Dallas/Fort Worth. By spatially integrating the individual urban/industrial HCHO plumes observed by OMI we can constrain the corresponding HCHO-weighted HRVOC emissions. Application to the Houston plume indicates a HCHO source of 260±110 kmol h-1 and implies a factor of 5.5±2.4 underestimate of anthropogenic HRVOC emissions in the US Environmental Protection Agency inventory. This approach allows us to monitor trends in HRVOC emissions over the US, in particular from the urban areas and oil/gas industry.",

            "abstract": "Modern seismicity record along the Manila Trench shows only infrequent Mw7 earthquakes, the lack of great earthquakes may indicate the subduction fault is either aseismically slipping or is accumulating strain energy toward rapid release in a megathrust earthquake. We conduct numerical simulations of the plate coupling, earthquake nucleation and dynamic rupture propagation processes along the Manila subduction fault (15-19.5ºN), taking into consideration the effects of plate geometry (including subducted seamounts), fault strength, rate-state frictional properties and pore pressure variations. Specifically, we use the bathymetry to depict the outline of Manila trench along its strike, 2681 background seismicity (1970/02/13 to 2013/09/06) from Chinese Earthquake Network Center and 540 focal mechanism solutions (1976/01/01 to 2013/01/27) from Global CMT project to constrain the geometry of the subducting Sunda/Eurasian slab. The compilation of seismicity and focal mechanism indicates the plate dipping angle gradually changes from 28º (south of the Scaborough Seamount Chain) to 12º (north of it). This geometric anomaly may due to the subducted part of the seamount chain. Preliminary modeling results using gabbro gouge friction data show that the Scaborough Seamount Chain could be a barrier to earthquake rupture propagation. Only earthquakes larger than Mw7 can overcome the barrier to rupture the entire Manila trench. Smaller earthquakes would cease rupturing when it encounters the seamount chain. Moreover, we propose that Manila trench subduction zone has the potential of rupturing in a Mw8 megathrust earthquake, if the simulation period is long enough for an Mw8 earthquake cycle and dynamic rupture overcomes the subducted Scaborough Seamount Chain. Our model parameters will be further constrained by laboratory rock mechanics experiments conducted on IODP Expedition 349, South China Sea (SCS), drilling samples (work in progress at China Earthquake Administration Key Laboratory of Earthquake Dynamics), and by GPS records from the Luzon Island. Our results improve ability of earthquake and tsunami hazards assessment and mitigation in the populated regions around the SCS, and provide theoretical basis for future ocean bottom seismometer and seafloor geodesy experiments in the SCS.",

            "abstract": "Oxygen fugacity (fO2) plays a vital role in determining mineral stability and depth of melting in the mantle. Several studies have used the spinel peridotite oxybarometer to estimate fO2; yet few data exist from ocean islands, despite the importance of fO2 to understanding ocean island basalt petrogenesis (Herzberg and Asimow, 2008).\nWe report fO2 recorded by peridotite xenoliths from three ocean islands: Savai'i (average fO2 = QFM -1.4 to +0.9), Tahiti (QFM +0.6 to +0.7) and Tubuai (QFM -1.1 to +0.2). We calculate fO2 using methods and standards from Wood and Virgo (1989) and Wood (RiMG, 1990). Oxygen fugacities span a similar range to those reported for El Hierro, Oahu, and Tahiti by Ballhaus (1993): more reduced than arc peridotites, but more oxidized than abyssal peridotites. Spinels in several of the xenoliths are heterogeneous and record a range of apparent fO2 at the mm scale. We propose two distinct mechanisms for introducing fO2 heterogeneity: melt refertilization (Tubuai) and diffusive reequilibration (Savai’i and Tubuai).\nSpinels in one Tubuai sample record increasing fO2 from QFM-0.6 in the xenolith interior to +1.1 at the basalt interface. Apparent fO2 recorded by these spinels correlate with TiO2, an indicator of melt refertilization (Pearce et al., 2000). We suggest that spinels from the xenolith interior record the relatively low fO2 conditions of the lithospheric mantle, while host basalt has oxidized near-interface spinels. Uniformly high TiO2, fO2, and low olivine Mg# in Tahitian xenoliths from this study may indicate that refertilization has reset the fO2 recorded by these rocks.\nClosed-system diffusive reequilibration, caused by changes in temperature, can also change the fO2 recorded by a peridotite. In samples from Savai'i and Tubuai with multiple spinel habits, fine intergrowth spinels and the rims of large, equant spinels record higher apparent fO2 and lower Al2O3 than cores of large grains. Canil and O'Neill (1996) suggest that the MgAl2O4 component in spinel dissolves into pyroxenes as a function of increasing temperature, leaving a lower modal proportion of Fe3+-rich spinel. Because we find no evidence for melt refertilization, we suggest that thermal interaction with a plume caused subsolidus, partial reequilibration that increased the fO2 recorded by these peridotites prior to eruption.",

After examining the vertical structure and spatial distribution of tropical convection, we found that a coarser resolution produces less partition of shallow convection, while a finer resolution tends to produce greater one in convective regions. We further examine the influence of shallow convection strength on precipitation by comparing the western and eastern Pacific ITCZ. In the western Pacific ITCZ, where is dominated by deep convection, the variation of precipitation among the spatial-resolution experiments is mainly due to the contribution of thermodynamic processes. The warmer climate found in coarser resolutions enhances precipitation frequency and intensity, and then the corresponding precipitation amount. In the eastern Pacific ITCZ, which has more shallow convection, shallow convection becomes the dominant factor to determine the variation of precipitation. More partition of shallow convection found in finer resolutions tends to enhance precipitation frequency and intensity, and the total precipitation amount. This provides potential evidence that shallow convection first affects the occurrence and intensity of precipitation, and then the total amount of precipitation in the region.",

            "abstract": "The changes in summer rainfall over the Tarim Basin, China, and the underlying mechanisms have been investigated using the observed rainfall data at 34 stations and the NCEP–NCAR reanalysis data during the period of 1961–2007. Results show that the summer rainfall over the Tarim Basin, which exhibits a significant increasing trend during the last half century, is closely related to the summer middle and upper tropospheric cooling over central Asia. Mechanism analysis indicates that the middle and upper tropospheric cooling over central Asia results in a location farther south of the subtropical westerly jet over western and central Asia with anomalous southerly wind at lower levels and ascending motion prevailing over the Tarim Basin. Such anomalies in the atmospheric circulations provide favorable conditions for the enhanced summer rainfall over the Tarim Basin. Further analysis suggests that the weakened South Asian summer monsoon (SASM) could be potentially responsible for the middle and upper tropospheric cooling over central Asia. This is largely through the atmospheric responses to the diabatic heating effect of the SASM. A weakened SASM can result in an anomalous cyclone in the middle and upper troposphere over central Asia. The western part of the anomalous cyclone produces more cold air advection, which leads to the cooling. This study suggests indirect but important effects of the SASM on the summer rainfall over the Tarim Basin.",

            "abstract": "The 110 Ma subduction of the Hikurangi Plateau, 2 km shallower than at present, has uplifted and deformed the New Zealand sector of Gondwana. Jamming of this subduction near the southern limit of the South Island began c. 105 Ma leading to rotation and offset of the margin before subduction ceased a c. 100 Ma. Rotation of the offshore margin from WNW–ESE to W-E led to opening of the Great South Basin and crustal thinning between rotated crustal blocks in the Inner Bounty Trough.\nSubsequent erosion of the uplifted margin has removed any uplifted volcanic arc volcanism and associated magnetic anomaly. Late Cenozoic distributed deformation throughout the South Island of New Zealand, and concentrated along the Alpine Fault, are linked to the strike slip/compressional plate boundary motion through the island. The combined Cretaceous and Neogene deformational episodes have made convergent margin recognition difficult onshore.\nBy examining the gravity anomaly field of the New Zealand region and in particular the horizontal gravity anomaly gradient, combined with limited crustal scale seismic reflection records available offshore, it is possible to trace some of the convergent margins of the New Zealand Late Paleozoic-Late Mesozoic Eastern province from offshore to onshore.\nThe Triassic-Jurassic Chatham Rise convergent margin can be traced, via two 60 km SSW left-lateral offsets, onshore into the central South Island. The first offset matches the offset Chatham Rise to the Banks Peninsula arch extending to the Canterbury foothills. Seismicity associated with the 1994 Arthurs Pass earthquake which occurred on the northern margin of the alpine segment of the Chatham Rise extension is very similar in character to the 2010 Canterbury earthquake sequence which occurred above the Canterbury Plains segment of the Chatham Rise.\nThe New Zealand Jurassic-Cretaceous convergent margin can be recognised in gravity, seismic reflection and bathymetry data along the northern Chatham Rise and a Permian-Triassic convergent margin can be recognised in gravity in the southern-central South Island.\nThe presence of the buoyant Chatham Rise crustal block has meant that Late Cenozoic faulting in the Marlborough region has all been diverted west of the Alpine Chatham Rise crustal block onto the Alpine Fault",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial ecosystem plays the important role as carbon sink in the global carbon cycle. Understanding of interactions of terrestrial carbon cycle with climate is important for better prediction of future climate change. In this study, terrestrial carbon cycle is investigated by Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model, version 2, Carbon Cycle (HadGEM2-CC) that considers vegetation dynamics and an interactive carbon cycle with climate. The simulation for future projection is based on the three (8.5 / 4.5 / 2.6) representative concentration pathways (RCPs) from 2006 to 2100 and compared with historical land carbon uptake from 1979 to 2005. Projected changes in ecological features such as production, respiration, net ecosystem exchange and climate condition show similar pattern in three RCPs, while the response amplitude in each RCPs are different. For all RCP scenarios, temperature and precipitation increase with rising of the atmospheric CO2. Such climate conditions are favorable for vegetation growth and extension, causing future increase of terrestrial carbon uptakes in all RCPs. At the end of 21st century, the global average of gross and net primary productions and respiration increase in all RCPs and terrestrial ecosystem remains as carbon sink. This enhancement of land CO2uptake is attributed by the vegetated area expansion, increasing LAI (Leaf Area Index), and early onset of growing season. After mid-21st century, temperature rising leads to excessive increase of soil respiration than net primary production and thus the terrestrial carbon uptake begins to fall since that time. Regionally the NEE (Net Ecosystem Exchange) average value of East-Asia (90°E-140°E, 20°N-60°N) area is bigger than that of the same latitude band. In the end-21st the NEE mean values in East-Asia area are -2.09 PgC yr-1, -1.12 PgC yr-1, -0.47 PgC yr-1 and zonal mean NEEs of the same latitude region are -1.12 PgC yr-1, -0.55 PgC yr-1, -0.17 PgC yr-1 for RCP 8.5, 4.5, 2.6 .\nAcknowledgements.

            "abstract": "As part of the South China Sea Deep project, we deployed a free-ascending tripod (FAT) on the sea floor of northern South China Sea at a water depth of 1900 m. During the 5-month deployment, the tripod hosted a suite of acoustic and optical oceanographic instruments that simultaneously measured time-series of 3-D velocity structure of the near bottom flows, temperature and salinity, water turbidity (sediment concentration), and particle size variations. A camera system and an acoustic altimeter closely monitored fine scale changes of the sea floor that could have resulted from either physical processes (erosion/deposition) or biological activities. Our goal of the tripod work, first-ever such study in South China Sea, along with several subsurface moorings that were also collecting flow and sedimentological data in the area, was to investigate the bottom boundary layer (BBL) processes and the regional deep current circulation surrounding a large body of sediment deposit whose formation mechanism and origins of sediment are still unclear. In addition, the tripod instruments were set up to capture the in-situ BBL signature of passing “benthic storms” that are believed to be the most important BBL processes in deep ocean. This presentation also includes a brief description of the technological advances implemented in the FAT deep-water tripod.",

            "abstract": "Biogenic magnetic minerals produced by magnetotactic bacteria occur ubiquitously in natural aquatic environments. Their identification and characterization are important for interpretation of paleomagnetic and environmental magnetic records. We compare two magnetic methods for their identification and characterization in a diverse set of sedimentary environments: ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy and first-order reversal curve (FORC) diagrams, constrained by transmission electron microscope observations. The advantages and limitations of each method are evaluated. FMR analysis provides a strong diagnostic indicator because of its ability to detect the strong shape anisotropy that arises from the biogenic chain architecture, but it can be obscured in mixed magnetic mineral assemblages. We develop a new FMR fitting approach that enables separation and characterization of biogenic components in natural samples. FMR spectral fitting on magnetofossil-bearing samples does not always reveal a strong signature of biogenic magnetite with <111>-aligned chains, in contrast to whole MTB cells. This indicates that strictly <111>-aligned chains are not as common in magnetofossil assemblages, either due to chain collapse or different crystallographic axis orientations. FORC analysis provides an excellent tool for isolating the biogenic component as a ‘central ridge’ signature with peak switching field distribution between ~20 and 60 mT. We also analyzed tuff samples with similar FMR characteristics to biogenic magnetite chains, which can cause ambiguity. We propose a magnetic protocol to improve the robustness and efficiency of biogenic magnetite identification and past microbial activity in a wide range of environments.",

            "abstract": "Nothofagus (Southern Beech) is the most widely reported plant from Cenozoic Antarctic fossil assemblages. Most of the fossils are of pollen morphotypes and it is assumed that the plants the pollen represents were growing on the continent. However, because of the uncertainties with systematics, long-distance dispersal, and reworking, it has been difficult to interpret the assemblages in terms of paleoenvironments and paleoclimate. Here, we report an in situ assemblage of Nothofagus leaves and pollen from the Friis Hills (77⁰ 45’S, 161⁰ 28’E). The leaves are preserved as carbonaceous impressions in brown, fissile shales that represent the deposits of a lake occupying a glacial valley. The leaves most probably accumulated from deciduous shrubs. Based on the stratigraphic relationship to a tephra with a 40 Ar/39 Ar age of c. 20 Ma, the leaf assemblage is of early Miocene age. Nothofagus pollen from the shale suggests that at least 3 species were represented. A total of 227 leaves were examined and lengths, widths, and areas recorded. The preservation is generally good but only a few of the specimens represent complete leaves; the spectrum is 30-100%. Plots of the measurements of the leaves provide a summary of size variation but were otherwise not useful for separating out different taxa . The most useful characters for establishing differences between the leaves were the leaf margins, of which three or four types were distinguished: 1. margins entire or finely serrate between ribs; 2. margins with one or two convex lobes between the ribs; 3. margins with convex lobes over the ribs. The leaf study indicates that three or possibly four species were co-inhabiting the valley in the early Miocene and were part of a dynamic vegetation that colonized the valley with each deglaciation.  A possible analog today would be at low elevations in Tierra del Fuego where three species of Nothofagus coexist. The stem diameters of abundant wood preserved in adjacent facies indicates that the plants were shrubs and not trees, and that the landscape was tundra and not forest. Mean summer temperature was possibly 6-7⁰ C. By 14 Ma, immediately before the extinction of Nothofagus on the continent, diversity had declined to a single species. The research was supported by NSF grants 0739693 and 0948652.",

            "abstract": "Foulden Maar is an annually laminated lacustrine diatomite deposit from the South Island of New Zealand. The deposit was laid down over ~100 kyr of the latest Oligocene and earliest Miocene, during the peak and deglaciation phase of the Mi-1 Antarctic glaciation event. At this time, New Zealand was located at approximately the same latitude as today (~45°S). Evidence from organic geochemical proxies (δD, δ13C) and physical properties (density, colour) indicates the presence of an 11-kyr cycle at the site. Although it is known that 11-kyr insolation (half-precession) cycles occur between the Tropics, this cycle is rarely seen in sedimentary archives deposited outside the immediate vicinity of the Equator. Records from Foulden Maar correlate well with the amplitude and phase of the modelled equatorial half-precession cycle for the earliest Miocene.\nHigh-resolution (50 µm) colour intensity measurements and lamina thickness measurements both indicate the presence of significant ENSO-like (2-8 year) variation in the Foulden Maar sediments. Early results from targeted lamina thickness measurements suggest that ENSO-band variation is modulated by the 11-kyr cycle, with power in the ENSO band increasing during periods of increased insolation at the Equator. This implies that equatorial half-precession had a significant effect on ENSO-like variation in the early Miocene, and that this effect was felt as far afield as the mid-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere.",

            "abstract": "The solar wind consists of finite amplitude fluctuations which cause nonlinear turbulent cascade, instabilities, and plasma heating. The solar wind observations show that ion temperature perpendicular to the magnetic field is larger than the parallel temperature. Pitch angle scattering by ion cyclotron waves through wave-particle interactions could be an key role to describe the perpendicular heating of ions in the solar wind however, this study proposes another candidate.\nWe investigate nonlinear development of parallel propagating, ion-scale, finite amplitude whistler wave (parent wave), by using tow-dimensional, electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations. Our simulation results show that Modified-Two-Stream Instability (MTSI), which comes from cross-field current of the parent wave, leads to fast dissipation of the wave compared with a time scale of decay instability. The MTSI generates quasi-perpendicular propagating whistler waves which scatter electrons and ions in the direction parallel and perpendicular to the background magnetic field, respectively. The wave generation and the scattering decrease the cross-field current, and causes the fast dissipation of the parent wave. The simulations suggest that the quasi-perpendicular propagating whistler waves have an important role to describe the perpendicular ion heating in the solar wind.",

            "abstract": "Edge waves, gravity waves trapped close to the shoreline by refraction, can in some cases form a standing wave pattern with alongshore periodic sequence of high and low runup. Nonlinear mechanisms for generation of edge waves by monochromatic waves incident on a planar beach from deep water have been elaborated theoretically and in the lab. Edge waves have been long considered a potential source for alongshore periodic morphological patterns in the swash (e.g., beach cusps), and edge-wave based predictions of cusp spacing compare qualitatively well with many field observations. We will discuss the extension of lab observations and numerical modeling to include incident waves with significant frequency and directional bandwidth. Laboratory experiments were performed at the Cantabria Coastal and Ocean Basin. The large rectangular basin (25 m cross-shore by 32 m alongshore) was heavily instrumented, had reflective sidewalls, and a steep concrete beach (slope 1:5) with a constant depth (1m) section between the wavemaker and beach. With monochromatic, normally incident waves we observed the expected, previously described subharmonic observations. Edge wave vertical heights at the shoreline reached 80cm, and edge wave uprushes exceeded the sloping beach freeboard. When frequency and frequency-directional spread are increased, the excited edge wave character changes substantially. In some cases, subharmonic excitation is suppressed completely. In other cases, edge waves are\nexcited intermittently and unpredictably. The spatially and temporally steady forcing required for strong, persistent subharmonic instability is lacking with even modestly spread (direction and frequency) incident waves. An SPH numerical model is capable of reproducing aspects of the observations. It seems unlikely to us that subhamonic edge waves alone are responsible for most cusp formation on natural beaches. The steady incident wave forcing needed to initiate subharmonic growth, and to maintain subharmonics long enough to build cups, are abundantly present with an incident plane wave, but lacking in many natural settings. Although subharmonic edge waves can potentially start the initial spacing, positive feedback between flow and morphology are likely critical to cusp growth.",

            "abstract": "Seismologists have now believed that the fault interface is characterized by the asperity-matrix structure, where the upper and lower plates are strongly coupled at the asperity, and the matrix, which surrounds the asperity, is deformed by creeping. Earthquakes are generated by dynamic rupture only in the non-creeping hard asperity, where the strain energy is accumulated if the asperity and matrix are mechanically coupled to a certain degree. In this presentation, we will argue that this structure is developed as brittle fracturing proceeds aided by dissolution-precipitation creep in particular at the brittle-ductile transition zone, which leads to the strength reduction and seimogenesis in both crust and subduction zones. We have been studying deformation processes and mechanisms in rocks at brittle-ductile transition conditions, based on microstructural analyses in naturally deformed rocks. For example, we reported that pervasive micro-faulting in the high-P/T Sambagawa quartz schist at brittle-ductile transition conditions, where a volume fraction of micro-shear zones consisting of both very-fine grained dynamically recrystallized quartz and white mica increased with increasing deformation (Takeshita and El-Fakharani, 2013). We believe that the resultant structure, “undeformed lenses surrounded by microshear zones” can be correlated with the asperity-matrix structure in the thin section scale, which could have occurred in the mesoscopic to macroscopic scales (cf. Schrank et al., 2008). It is inferred that the rocks became softened with increasing volume fraction of micro-shear zones, because dissolution-precipitation creep could have occurred at low differential stresses in the sheared zones. Further, cataclasites were formed along the Median Tectonic Line in the Cretaceous to Paleogene, where new minerals precipitated from fluids in the space created by fracturing at the conditions of brittle-ductile transition. The fracturing was accompanied by element migration via fluids, the degree of which increased with increasing degree of fracturing. In conclusion, deformation occurred by dissolution-mass transfer-precipitation assisted by fracturing under the conditions of brittle-ductile transition, by which significant weakening could have been generated in rocks.",

            "abstract": "Planetary surface mobility depends on lithospheric stresses arising from the mantle’s convective vigor. Using a model of thermochemical convection featuring force-balanced plates we examine the effect on surface mobility of different fractions of compositionally dense mantle material. Specifically, we introduce a uniform thickness compositionally enriched basal layer in a system with mobile-lid tectonics and monitor whether an active lid is subsequently maintained. We find that long-term surface mobility decreases when enriched material is present. High mobility is always maintained if the total material volume is no more than 1% of the mantle volume. For the inferred volume of the Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) in the present-day Earth, surface mobility is dependent on the buoyancy ratio of the enriched material. If the compositionally dense material self-organizes into provinces, both surface mobility and mantle upwelling vigor become more variable. Generally, upwellings that form at the edges of provinces are more buoyant relative to upwellings that form on the tops of provinces. If enriched material envelops the core, upwelling vigor is diminished so that plates are consumed more quickly than they can fragment, and surface mobility is eventually lost.",

            "abstract": "Storm and tsunami deposits have been identified and described from many siliciclastic coastlines globally, but detailed comparison of both known storm and tsunami deposits from the same coastlines are lacking. An opportunity to compare storm and tsunami sedimentary deposits was recognised following sediment deposition by Cyclone Thane (25th to 31st December 2011) that were superimposed on sediments deposited during the Indian Ocean Tsunami (26th December 2004) in a pit (DPM3a) near Cuddalore, on the south-eastern Indian coastline. A second pit, at Silver Beach (SB1) was located 2 km south of Pit DPM3a, was examined for comparison with Pit DPM3a.\nPit DPM3a contained four distinct units, an oldest intertidal unit, the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, and a reworked aeolian sand that is capped by the Cyclone Thane deposit. Pit SB1 contained an oldest intertidal deposit, an estuarine beach and capped by the Cyclone Thane deposit. The identification of these units was verified from satellite imagery. The pits were examined at 1cm increments for grainsize and grain shape characteristics, loss on ignition, heavy mineral concentrations and microfossils.\nA suite of statistical analyses, including exploratory data analysis techniques, analysis of variance and principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant function analysis (DFA) was used to compare the measured parameters and the individual deposits within and between pits DPM3a and SB1. Individual deposits showed significant differences in many of the parameters, but no individual variable was diagnostic of the deposits. PCA of Pit DPM3a suggested that the proportion of heavy minerals was the strongest parameter to distinguish the storm deposit from the tidal, aeolian and tsunami deposit, but that significant overlap between the deposits occurred. The application of DFA showed that in Pit DPM3a, the storm deposit could be distinguished from the tsunami, tidal and aeolian deposits. However, applying the same data analysed from Pit SB1 showed a marked difference in unit characteristics, highlighting that the discriminant function models can only be applied to the training dataset (Pit DPM3a) and cannot be applied to nearby sites (e.g. Pit SB1).",

            "abstract": "Seasonal rainfall forecasts are predicted throughout Australia based on concurrent sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) fields coming from the main dynamical Australian model, the Predictive Ocean-Atmosphere Model for Australia (POAMA). In this study, we derive SSTA fields using a multi-model combination approach by including information from five additional models. The combination takes into account the cross-dependence between all the models while combining individual SSTA fields. The resulting SSTA fields are then used to derive SSTA indices to issue seasonal rainfall forecasts rainfall over a 2.5 degree grid using a Bayesian Model Averaging approach currently in use operationally. These forecasts are compared with those derived from a single SSTA model in three settings: (i) 2.5 degree gridded rainfall over Australia; (ii) only grid cells where one of the models (multi-model or single model) had skill (measured in terms of mean squared error relative to climatology) ; and (iii) only grid cells where both of the models had skill. The results indicate that the forecasts derived using multi-model based SSTA indices offer clear improvements over the case where a single SSTA model is used in three seasons, ASO (August, September and October), FMA (February, March and April), and MJJ (May, June and July). A further assessment over grid locations where predictability is significantly better than climatology indicates consistent improvements when the multi-model SSTA fields are used.",

            "abstract": "We report a surge-like overturning structure of the sodium layer in the lower thermospheric region (~110-120km) observed by a sodium lidar located at Haikou (20.0N, 110.3E), China. During 15:00UT ~ 15:30UT (Local time +8h), the sodium density shows an abrupt vertical increasing from ~100km to ~120km, and then falls down with a speed of ~2.5km/hr. The adjacent radio observations from COSMIC satellites and two ionosondes located at Fuke (19.5N, 109.1E) and Sanya (18.4N, 109.6E) indicate complicated ionospheric E region structures, i.e., multiple sporadic-E (Es) layers, covering the Hainan island region (18N-21N, 108-111E). Further more, a VHF radar located at Sanya (18.4, 109.6E) observed the field align irregularities (FAIs), which appear almost simultaneously with the surge-like structure of the sodium. The radar receiving SNR and the corresponding Doppler speed show a similar vertical increasing structure extending from ~100km to ~130km and the charged particles moving away (i.e., upward) from radar at the beginning of the FAIs and follows by descend-layer-like FAIs with a downward speed of 2.9km/hr. From these observational evidence, the surge-like structure of sodium layer is linked to the ionospheric E-region FAIs. We propose the possible process related to the formation of the surge-like sodium layer: the preexisted Es might provide a suitable gradient, and the gravity wave could trigger the K-H instability and push the upward moving of the charged particles, which are the source of Na+ and can be converted to Na through the chemical reactions. The investigations using the lidar temperature (35-55km), meteor radar wind (85-95km) and sodium column density and centroid height indicate that the gravity wave with period of ~4 hours and vertical wavelength of ~10km might be potential driver.",

            "abstract": "Partitioning the ecosystem evapotranspiration (ET) into soil evaporation (E) and transpiration (T) is challenging and crucial to understand hydrological processes in land. In this study, we deployed a recently developed partitioning technique using high frequency in-situ water vapor isotopic measurement and surface/soil water sampling over a paddy field near Tokyo, Japan for a full growing season. We partitioned ET via estimating the isotopic signal of ET (δET) and its two components, i.e. T (δT) and E (δE). δET was determined through the use of Keeling plot. Estimates of δT was obtained by direct measurement of surface/soil isotopic measurement assuming a steady state of transpiration. δE was estimated using the Craig-Gordon model in combination with surface and vapor water isotopic measurement. The T/ET ranged approximately from 0.3 to 1, almost kept increasing during early growing season, then kept a relative constant value close to 1 after that. T/ET was strongly controlled by green leaf area index (LAI) in day to day time scale (y=0.14ln(x)+0.66; R-squared=0.62). We also investigated the uncertainties in estimating these three terms (δET, δT, and δE) and their effect on ET partitioning. The uncertainty analysis showed the uncertainty from δE had a minor impact on the ET partitioning but mainly controlled by uncertainty from δT and δET estimations. During early growing season, ET partitioning uncertainty was mainly due to uneven spatial distribution of surface water isotope (δT). As LAI increases, the impact of δET uncertainty became much larger than the other two terms. The results demonstrated the robustness of using isotope measurements for partitioning evapotranspiration.",

New expectations on researchers based on policies from governments and funders to share data fully, openly, and in a timely manner present significant challenges but are also opportunities to improve the quality and efficiency of research and its accountability to society. Researchers should be able to archive and disseminate data as required by many institutions or funders, and civil society to scrutinize datasets underlying public policies. Thus, the trustworthiness of data services must be verifiable. In addition, the need to integrate large and complex datasets across disciplines and domains with variable levels of maturity calls for greater coordination to achieve sufficient interoperability and sustainability.\nThe World Data System (WDS) of the International Council for Science (ICSU) promotes long-term stewardship of, and universal and equitable access to, quality-assured scientific data and services across a range of disciplines in the natural and social sciences. WDS aims at coordinating and supporting trusted scientific data services for the provision, use, and preservation of relevant datasets to facilitate scientific research, in particular under the ICSU umbrella, while strengthening their links with the research community. WDS certifies it Members, holders and providers of data or data products, using internationally recognized standards. Thus, providing the building blocks of a searchable common infrastructure, from which a data system that is both interoperable and distributed can be formed.\nThis presentation will describe the coordination role of WDS and more specifically activities developed by its Scientific Committee to:\nImprove and stimulate basic level Certification for Scientific Data Services, in particular through collaboration with the Data Seal of Approval.\nIdentify and define best practices for Publishing Data and to test their implementation by involving the core stakeholders i.e. researchers, institutions, data centres, scholarly publishers, and funders.\nEstablish an open WDS Metadata Catalogue, Knowledge Network, and Global Registry of Trusted Data Services.",

            "abstract": "Food system includes biophysical factors (climate, land and water), human environments (production technologies and food consumption, distribution and marketing), as well as the dynamic interactions within them. Climate change affects agriculture and food systems in various ways. Agricultural production can be influenced directly by climatic factors such as mean temperature rising, change in rainfall patterns, and more frequent extreme events. Eventually, climate change could cause shift of arable land, alteration of water availability, abnormal fluctuation of food prices, and increase of people at risk of malnutrition.\nThis work aims to evaluate how climate change would affect agricultural production biophysically and how these effects would propagate to social factors at the global level. In order to model the complex interactions between the natural and social components, a Global Optimization model of Agricultural Land and Water resources (GOALW) is applied to the analysis. GOALW includes various demands of human society (food, feed, other), explicit production module, and irrigation water availability constraint. The objective of GOALW is to maximize global social welfare (consumers’ surplus and producers’ surplus).Crop-wise irrigation water use in different regions around the world are determined by the model; marginal value of water (MVW) can be obtained from the model, which implies how much additional welfare benefit could be gained with one unit increase in local water availability. Using GOALW, we will analyze two questions in this presentation: 1) how climate change will alter irrigation requirements and how the social system would buffer that by price/demand adjustment; 2) how will the MVW be affected by climate change and what are the controlling factors. These results facilitate meaningful insights for investment and adaptation strategies in sustaining world’s food security under climate change.",

Details on the uplift and deformation, especially those inside the lower crust and upper mantle are still debated. Seismic anisotropy measured from SKS splitting data has been combined with surface GPS data to determine whether the crust and upper mantle beneath the margin have coherent deformation. Due to the poor depth resolution of the SKS data, it is still difficult to constrain the distribution of crustal and upper mantle anisotropy separately with the combined dataset. In this study we used the receiver function to measure crustal anisotropy and combined it with SKS splitting data to determine the anisotropy within the upper mantle. We applied this technique to 80 permanent broadband stations in the area operated by the China Earthquake Administration (CEA). The receiver function data indicate that the crust beneath the plateau possesses a strong azimuthal anisotropic component, with measured delay time varying from 0.50 to 0.90 s. To constrain mantle anisotropy with SKS data, we first correct the waveform distortion induced by crustal anisotropy, and then use them to estimate the splitting parameters. The splitting time measured from the corrected SKS data varies from 0.45 to 0.95 s with rather complicated lateral distribution. These results will be further compared with numerical data to better constrain the deformation mechanism of the area.",

            "abstract": "The following collision model of the Himalayan collision belt is proposed based on data published in previous studies. Collision between the Indian and Asian blocks started in the west before ca. 55 Ma. In the western part, the amount of oceanic slab subducted prior to continent collision was enough to pull the continental crust down to the depths of UHP metamorphism (750–770°C, 30–35 kbar), as a wide ocean existed between the Asian and Indian blocks prior to collision. Following UHP metamorphism, oceanic slab break-off started at ca. 46~55 Ma in the west due to the very strong buoyancy of the deeply subducted continental block. In contrast, the subduction of continental crust continued at this time in the middle and eastern parts of the belt. The zone of break-off migrated eastward, initiating a change from steep- to low-angle subduction. In the mid-eastern parts of the belt, the slab break-off occurred at depth of HP eclogite facies metamorphism (>780°C, 20 kbar) at ca. 30 Ma. Final slab break-off may have occurred in the easternmost part of the belt at ca. 22-25 Ma. The slab break-off in the eastern part occurred at the depth of high-pressure granulite facies metamorphism (890°C, 17–18 kbar).The depth of slab break-off decreased toward the east, indicating that the rate of uplift decreased eastwards due to a decrease in buoyancy of the continental slab. The slower uplift resulted in a longer period of thermal relaxation and a higher geothermal gradient. In the west, the high rate of uplift resulted the epidote amphibolite facies (580–610°C) retrograde metamorphic overprint on the UHP eclogites, whereas the relatively slow uplift in the mid-eastern part caused high-grade granulites (850°C) retrograde metamorphic overprint on the HP eclogites. The study indicates that the metamorphic pattern along the collision belt is strongly related to the amount of subducted oceanic crust between continents before collision and the depth of slab break-off. Therefore metamorphic pattern can be used to interpret the tectonic process during continental collision which disappeared now.\n.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric aerosols are important to atmospheric chemistry, and affect our lives. Aerosols include fine particles, which consist of inorganic compounds, organic substances, heavy metals, etc. Aerosols can be roughly separated into natural and anthropogenic origins. For example, natural origins include wind-blown sea-salt, Asian dust (called Kosa in Japan), etc. Anthropogenic origins include burning of fossil fuel and agricultural biomass, automobiles, industrial activities, etc. In Japan, Kosa is the most well-known aerosol. This study investigated anthropogenic-origin-metals present in the aerosols. Aerosol samples were collected at Cape Hedo Atmospheric Aerosol Monitoring Station (CHAAMS) in Okinawa Island, Japan with a high volume air sampler. Samples analyzed for this study were collected between January 2008 and August 2014. A 1/8 of aerosol filter was digested by the mixture of acids and oxidant (nitric acid/hydrogen fluoride/hydrogen peroxide). The sample was filtered by 0.45 µm membrane filter before analyses. Metal ion concentrations were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (Na, Mg, K) and inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (Al, Fe, Ca, Ti, Mn, V, Cu, Cd, Zn, Pb). Air mass movement was analyzed by NOAA’s HYSPRIT model. Results showed that concentrations of heavy metals were high during winter and spring, and the lowest in summer. V/Mn ratios were used as an indicator for heavy oil burning. High V/Mn ratios were observed during maritime air mass periods. On the other hand, Pb/Zn ratio was used as an indicator for leaded gasoline usage, which was high when air mass was coming from Asian continent during winter and spring. Average Pb/Zn ratio was 0.65. Non-sea-salt K (nss-K) was used as an indicator for biomass burning, and showed good correlation with total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations. However, nss-K and crustal-origin-metals also showed good correlation. Thus, we have to be careful when considering whether nss-K is from burning-origin or crust-origin metal.",

DCL is defined as failure depth > 10 m including bedrock with mass volume > 100000 m3. This study was conducted in the upper area (252 km2) of Saru river system (1350 km2) in the west side of Hidaka Mountain region, Hokkaido, Japan. Altitude of the area ranged from 200 to 1500 m. Recent DCL occurred in 2003 at middle stream area of Saru river system. We firstly investigated topographic features of DCL using aerial photographs and airborne LiDAR for identifying locations of old DCL scars and deposits. We also identified knick lines for topographic evolutions which typically occurred in altitude around 600 m. Extracted topographic features were archived into ArcGIS to analyze area, volume, height, altitude and slope gradient. Areas of extracted DCL were ranged from 1.6 x 104 to 2.8 x 105 m2 which agreed to the contemporary DCL occurred in Japan in past 120 yrs. We used six index tephra deposited in AD 1739, AD 1694, AD 1667, 2500 yrs BP, 9000 yrs BP, 16,000 to 19,000 yrs BP which were came from various volcanos located east side of our study site. Field investigation of soil profile in 15 DCL scars among 32 extracted DCL scars from LiDAR showed that 10 DCLs occurred before 9000 yrs BP, the one DCL occurred from 9000 to 2500 yrs BP, three DCLs occurred 2500 to 300 yrs ago, and the other DCL occurred after 300 yrs ago. Our findings showed that topographic feature formed by DCL potentially remained more than 9000 years in the areas and high frequencies of DCL occurred from last glacial period. We further examine relationship probability density from small to large scale landslide occurred in this region.",

            "abstract": "Corals of the nearshore waters are increasingly under threat from a multitude of environmental changes. Amongst the most visible of these changes is arrival of large amounts of fine terrestrial sediment that degrade coral ecosystem's ability to capture sunlight and to reproduce. These muds and silts are products of accelerating landscape changes sweeping across the world's tropics in the last several hundred years of development. Unlike some of the more global threats to coral like ocean temperature increases, local communities can act to reduce this threat at human timescales. Yet restoring whole catchments is a daunting task. We use over 8 years of monitoring data to chart the sources, pathways and fate of fine sediment on its journey from the ridges of Moloka'i, Hawai'i to the reef below. Using imagery and topography from cm to meter-scale, instruments to capture and record the flow of water and sediment, and mapping that synthesizes these measurements, we show that ~ 1% of the landscape contributes over half the fine sediment pollution during a brief period of intense rainfall, ~ 0.1% of the time. Pockets of deep silt erode at rates that are proportional to the amount of time it rains at rates above saturated hydraulic conductivities (c. 10-20 mm/hr). Recent removal of many feral ungulates resulted in rapid vegetation regrowth which has reduced lowering in hotspots by almost an order of magnitude over the last 5 years, from ~10 mm/year to ~ 1-2 mm/year. We contrast these results with emerging evidence from West Maui that the current sediment budget of plumes there is dominated by erosion of legacy in-stream deposits, a challenging mitigation task. Although local communities cannot address every threat to their reefs, they can expect to significantly reduce some sediment pollution by targeted mitigation.",

            "abstract": "Paleomagnetically reconstructed Laurasia and Gondwana are well satisfied. However, the Pangea reconstruction remains controversial. The Late Triassic-Early Jurassic reconstruction, Pangea A, is consistent with one derived by closure of the Atlantic Ocean. As going back to older Period, the Pangea A reconstruction cannot stand. Particularly, the Late Carboniferous and Permian reconstruction, Pangea B, placed Gondwana ~3500 km eastward relative to its Pangea A configuration. This might indicate that the super continent was tectonically evolving during the period. For instance, an intra Pangean megashear zone has been proposed to show the evolution from Pangea B to Pangea A. On the other hand, researchers suspected that the Pangea B reconstruction is not accurate, because of several factors, i.e., the effect of persistent, large non-dipole field, remagnetization, errors in paleomagnetic record (inclination shallowing), and so on.\nTo test the effect of inclination shallowing on the Pangea reconstruction, we here focus on the Late Carboniferous time, because, the Laurasian poles are mainly from volcanic rocks, and the Gondwana poles dominantly from sediments. This makes the test rather simple. Assuming a flattening factor of 0.5, we corrected the paleomagnetic inclinations of the Late Carboniferous results from Gondwana, and the inclination-corrected poles are thus achieved. The mean Laurasia and Gondwana poles can largely be accommodated by closure of the Atlantic Ocean, and the remaining offset may be solved by a ~15 degree relative rotation between the two continents. Relative rotation is often observed during continental collision (e.g., the collision between the North and South China blocks, the India-Asia collision, and so on), and more likely than the large scale shear. Our test indicates that Pangea B is probably the artifact of paleomagnetic inclination shallowing in sedimentary rocks.",

While East Asia is greatly affected by dust storms in spring from Taklamakan and Gobi deserts (Huang et al., 2010; Li et al., 2012), it also suffers from significant biomass burning emission from Southeast Asia during the same season. Observations from both surface monitoring and satellite data indicated that mineral dust and biomass burning aerosols may approach to coastal area of East Asia simultaneously, thus have a very unique impact on the local atmospheric environment and regional climate. In this study, we first investigated the inter-annual variations of biomass burning and dust aerosols emission for 5 consecutive years from 2006-2010 to estimate the upper and lower limits and correlation with meteorology conditions, and then evaluate their impacts with a chemical transport system. Our preliminary results indicated that biomass burning has a strong correlation with precipitation over Southeast Asia, which could drive the emission varying from 542 Tg in 2008 to 945 Tg in 2010, according to FLAMBE emission inventory (Reid et al., 2009). Mineral dust also demonstrated a strong dependence on wind filed. These inter-annual/annual variations will also lead to different findings and impacts on air quality in East Asia.\n",

It is possible that these biomass burning aerosols may have influenced convective clouds in the maritime continent though such cases have not been well simulated and understood. In order to improve understanding of the spatiotemporal coverage and influence of biomass burning aerosols in the maritime continent, we have used the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to study the transport of biomass burning aerosols from Malaysia peninsula, Sumatra, and Borneo, using biomass burning emissions from the Fire INventory from NCAR (FINN) version 1.0. We choose to use emissions from the month of August because the annual emissions peak often occurs within this month.

            "abstract": "Crystal-rich (40-50 vol.-%) intermediate to silicic lava has been the primary eruptive product of several recent hazardous eruptions: Mt. Pinatubo, Philippines (1991), Soufriere Hills, Montserrat (1995-present), and Unzen, Japan (1990-1995). Despite this association with such devastating eruptions, the formation, timing, and evacuation of such magmas is not well understood: do such eruptions tap a long-lived, multi-cycle crystal mush, or, is it generated in a single magmatic cycle prior to eruption? We are exploring these questions at the Unzen Volcanic Complex, Nagasaki-ken, Japan where a 500 ka history of crystal-rich dacitic dome eruptions has built the Unzen Volcanic Complex. Previous studies (e.g. Nakamura, 1995) have demonstrated the role of mafic recharge in rejuvenating crystal mush a few months prior to the most recent eruptions, but the history of the mush is unknown. Preliminary U-Th/U-Pb in zircon geochronology from the most recent eruption (Heisei-Shinzan; 1990-1995) and the 1792 dome collapse lava (Tenguyama; erupted 4.1±0.8 ka) reveal a complex history of individual zircons. Unpolished rims from the 1990-1995 eruption range in age from ~24.6 to 180 ka, while interior ages (on polished grains) are older, ranging from 60 to 200 ka. Zircons from Tenguyama record unpolished rim model ages of ca. 21 to 90 ka and interior ages of 37 to 225 ka. Rim-interior age differences range from 24 to 122 ka and 6 to 180 ka for Heisei-Shinzan and Tenguyama, respectively. No model ages younger than 20 ka have so far been determined. This leads to the hypothesis that eruptions at Unzen are tapping a long-lived, multi-cycle mush of significant longevity. Acquisition of additional U-Th/U-Pb data, including trace elements from other Unzen domes ranging in age back to 440 ka, is underway to test this hypothesis and more tightly link volcanism with subsurface processes.",

            "abstract": "Many commonly used instruments that measure the aerosol particle number size distribution, such as Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer, are based on the following principle: The particle sample is brought to a steady-state charge distribution in a bipolar aerosol charger. The particles are then segregated according to their electrical mobilities using differential mobility analyzer, DMA. Finally, the concentration of the particles is measured using a condensation particle counter, CPC. To estimate the particle size distribution, the concentration data are then inverted using an algorithm that takes into account the steady-state charge distribution and the performance characteristics of the DMA and CPC. Considerable effort has gone into the characterization of the instruments used in these measurements. The charge distribution remains the greatest source of uncertainty in the mobility based size distribution measurements. The charge distribution depends, at least, on the properties of the ion and particle (radius, density, relative permittivity and number of charges), concentrations of negative and positive ions, temperature and pressure. With these values given, the collision frequencies of ions and particles can be modeled to determine the charge distribution, but that can be very time consuming. Instead, the charge distribution is usually estimated using a simple parameterization of the results of one such model. The collision process can, however, be described using only two dimensionless parameters, namely the diffusive Knudsen number, KnD, and the ratio of electric potential energy to thermal energy, ΨE. A given pair of KnD and ΨE may describe multiple collision conditions, but it defines a single value of dimensionless flux coefficient, H. This allows us to tabulate the values of KnD, ΨE and H, so that H can be determined by interpolation for conditions corresponding to the measurements. The charge distribution can readily be calculated from the interpolated values of H. This procedure is particularly useful in the case of airborne measurements, since pressure and temperature variations with altitude result in a large deviations of the charge distribution from the commonly used parameterization.",

Previous work using air samples found 2-5 ppm mole fraction CO2ff 600m downwind of the plant; this study extends the data set back 30 years using radiocarbon measurements in tree rings.\nTrees incorporate CO2 from the local atmosphere into their cellulose which is laid down in annual growth rings during photosynthesis. To relate this to the fossil CO2 content of the air we measure 14C in annual tree rings at a local clean air site and compare this to measurements of 14C in the annual ring for the same year at our test site. Fossil CO2 is devoid of 14C so addition of CO2ff will cause an observed decrease in14C in samples directly related to the amount of CO2ff present.\nTrees growing immediately downwind of the Vector plant and from clean air locations in Taranaki and Wellington were cored. Annual rings were counted and cut into one year growth increments. Testing was performed on two cellulose extraction methods to confirm removal of contaminating material before the cellulose component was chemically isolated, combusted, graphitised and 14C measured by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry.\nWe will present initial results of the data; showing that Wellington tree and Taranaki clean air trees compare well with the Wellington atmospheric record whereas trees growing downwind of the Vector plant demonstrate lower 14C content consistent with fossil CO2 addition. We compare historic CO2ff emissions as sampled by the trees with reported emissions from the Vector plant to quantify and evaluate the ability of the technique to monitor changes in fossil CO2 emissions. We demonstrate how this technique could be applied alongside complimentary methods to evaluate fossil CO2 emissions at point sources worldwide to determine compliance of CO2 emitters with emission reduction targets",

            "abstract": "By using ERA-Interim and MERRA reanalysis, we firstly point out the Southern Hemisphere (SH) stratosphere warming is most significant during September, rather than during boreal winter of CP El Niño years. The SH stratospheric temperature anomalies become significant since July and reach the peak around September with a maximum above 4K, indicates the suppressed southern polar vortex and the strengthening of BD circulation in the Southern Hemisphere. After October, the southern polar positive signal decreases and the temperature anomalies becomes not significant. The E-P flux and the E-P flux divergence variations in SH mid-latitudes are most significant in August of CP El Niño, which lead SH stratospheric temperature anomalies by 1 month. The anomalously enhanced westward planetary waves at SH middle latitudes can propagate upward and poleward through the stratosphere westerly wind during SH winter (July-September). Thus, enhanced dissipation of westward planetary waves in the upper stratosphere of SH can cause anomalous warming in the polar region and cooling in the tropical stratosphere. The propagation of planetary waves in SH stratosphere is depressed and not significant since the westerly wind in SH stratosphere weakens rapidly from October to December. The significant anomalous eddy heat flux (EHF) are also found over mid- and high- latitude of SH stratosphere during August and weaken after September. The EHF at 100hPa (40°-80°S) suggest that the planetary wave activity is strengthened during July-September rather than during October-November in most CP El Niño events.",

            "abstract": "The concept of ensemble combinations for formulating improved climate forecasts has gained popularity in recent years. However, many climate models share similar physics or modeling processes, which may lead to similar (or strongly correlated) forecasts. Recent approaches for combining forecasts that take into consideration differences in model accuracy over space and time have either ignored the similarity of forecast among the models or followed a pairwise dynamic combination approach. Here we present a basis for combining model predictions, illustrating the improvements that can be achieved if procedures for factoring in inter-model dependence are utilised. The utility of the approach is demonstrated by combining sea surface temperature (SST) forecasts from five climate models over a period of 1960–2005. The variable of interest, the monthly global sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) at a 50´50 latitude–longitude grid, is predicted three months in advance to demonstrate the utility of the proposed algorithm. Results indicate that the proposed approach offers consistent and significant improvements for majority of grid points compared to the case where the dependence among the models is ignored. Therefore, the proposed approach of combining multiple models by taking into account the existing interdependence, provides an attractive alternative to obtain improved climate forecast. In addition, an approach to combine seasonal forecasts from multiple climate models with varying periods of availability is also demonstrated.",

            "abstract": "Taiwan has been constantly threatened by large, damaging earthquakes. Nowadays, EEWS is a useful tool for seismic hazard mitigation， and it is practical in Japan, Taiwan, Mexico, and the southern California (Kanamori, 1997). There are two types of EEWS. Generally, the front-type warning has higher accuracy than the on-site one because of the use of more stations and longer time window. On the other hand, the on-site type warning has the shorter reporting time, but lower accuracy because of using only one single or couple stations. Based on the on-site process, we installed two local early warning arrays in Ilan and Tainan city of the newly established EEW network and adopted the waveform stacking method to enhance the coherent part of early arrivals.\nWe selected 15 events in 2013 of Central Weather Bureau earthquake catalog, and used the MPd method to estimate the magnitude. Since the EEW network is newly established and the accelerometers (named as Palert) are all installed on the building wall instead of the free surface, the present Pdattenuation relationships have to modify to account for the building effect to get the new regression equation.\nWe show that the accuracy of magnitude estimation (MPd) for the on-site EEW mode by using the array stacking method can be significantly improved. Since the station density of the Palert network is high, more arrays can be formed especially in the metropolitan areas.\nKey words: EEW, EEW array, waveform stacking.",

            "abstract": "Based on merged altimetry data and in site observations from tide gauges, we analyzed the fast increasing trend of sea surface height (SSH) in the recent two decades in the tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean. The results of analysis indicated a dynamic connection of SSH between the tropical western Pacific and the southeastern Indian Ocean. The low-frequency variations of SSH propagate westward in the tropical Pacific, enter the Indonesian Seas through the waveguide, and influence the southeastern India Ocean with the Kelvin-Rossby wave transformation. The thermal structure of upper ocean reveals the above adjustment mainly occur in the thermocline. However, the impacts from the Pacific are limited in the southeast Indian Ocean. In the central and west of the south Indian Ocean, local wind dominates the SSH changes in the last two decades. By lead-lag statistic analyses, we identified the cause of interdecadal from the interannual SSH variations. The interannual SSH variations is dominated by ENSO, forced by the anomalous wind along the equatorial Pacific. Whereas, the interdecadal SSH variations results from the off-equatorial wind stress curl, which is closely related to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. The dynamic connections between the western Pacific and the south Indian Ocean were tested in the baroclinic Rossby wave solution and the numerical experiments based on the nonlinear reduced-gravity dynamics model.",

            "abstract": "A permafrost monitoring network with 20 boreholes was established over the upper reaches of Heihe River Basin in Qilian Mountains of northwestern China from 2011 to 2014. Boreholes were drilled along both east-west direction which is parallel to the Qilian Mountain ridges and the north-south transects. Elevation at these borehole sites varies from 3610 m to 4153m a.s.l. These boreholes cover different slope aspect, vegetation and land cover, and soil types. Five automatic meteorological stations were also established with additional measurements of soil moisture and temperature up to 2 m. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) method was used to detect active layer thickness and permafrost distribution over the study area. The results showed that the ground temperature at 16m depth ranged from -1.87°C to 2.25°C in Qilian Mountains and significantly influenced by topography and surface condition. There was a negative correction between elevation and mean annual ground temperature (MAGT), i.e., MAGT decreases as elevation increases. Based on data from GPR, the lower limit of permafrost was found at lowest elevation 3389m and 3657m on the north- and south-facing slopes, respectively. Active layer thickness varies from about 1.6 m at elevation about 4200 m a.s.l. to more than 4.0 m at 3650 m a.s.l on north-facing slope, and about 1m at about 3700m a.s.l on south-facing slope. Both the inverted ground temperature profiles and near-zero temperature gradients suggested that recent warming had already penetrated into the ground and influenced the thermal state of permafrost significantly. An intensive field survey and monitoring have been conducted over the area near the lower limit of permafrost to further investigate the response of permafrost to climate change.",

            "abstract": "We started a multidisciplinary research project to elucidate the history of recurring tsunamigenic slips on the shallowest portion of the plate boundary fault along the Japan Trench before the 2011 earthquake and to understand post-seismic transient processes since the massive rupture of 2011. In the 5-year project, we will: 1) Conduct high-resolution seismic surveys and use the resultant data to both elucidate the spatial extent of past shallow seismic slip events and identify deformation structures characteristic of the events. 2) Determine the timing of past slip events by collecting sub-seafloor sedimentary core samples from the ultra-deep environment near the Japan Trench and identifying and dating earthquake-generated turbidite layers. 3) Identify postseismic deformation processes on the shallow fault by using dense arrays of broadband seismic sensors and monitoring seafloor deformation near the trench axis. The geodetic monitoring includes continuous measurement of baseline lengths across the trench axis, which reflects relative motion of the overriding North American (or Amur) plate and the subducting Pacific plate.\n Systematic studies on past shallow seismic slip events will improve our understanding of the space–time history of large earthquakes, which has mostly derived from geological studies on tsunami deposits along coasts. The space–time history of large earthquakes will provide clues to understanding why earthquakes of M <8 have been frequent and those of M~9 infrequent in the same subduction system, a fundamental question raised by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. The post-2011 deformation near the trench will put strong constraint on the frictional behavior of the updip end of the megathrust. Since shallow slip events increase size of tsunamis associated with megathrust earthquakes, history of past events is crucial for evaluating tsunami hazard in regions facing to subduction zones. This project will establish a methodology to clarify reliable reccurence history of shallow seismic slip events in subduction zones in the world.",

For the first time we observe GPS seasonal motions associated with slow-moving landslides (earthflows). The directions of GPS movements after heavy rains and in the wet season are consistent with the slope directions derived from a high-resolution elevation model constructed by airborne Light detection and Ranging (LiDAR). Seasonal and long-term interseismic motions are modulated by slow-moving landslides. GPS observations of seasonal motions at Lushan suggest continuous creeping of earthflows at a rate of ~15 mm/yr in the wet season. Six out of 26 cGPS sites in the Central Range of Taiwan affected by earthflows show 25%~40% differences in amplitudes of interseismic velocities compared with the adjacent stable cGPS sites. Estimates of interseismic crustal strain can be biased without taking account surface processes. Preliminary analyses indicate rainfall and topography play stronger roles on the occurrence of earthflows compared to seismic activity and lithology. Discrimination between surface processes and tectonic-origin motions is the key to natural hazard assessments.",

Previous studies have shown that dusty clouds (a combination of dust and cloud) occur frequently in the source (desert) and downwind regions. Dusty clouds present critical difficulties in passive satellite remote sensing because dust often mix and/or underlie cloud and can have complicated microphysical and optical properties. The dusty cloud can lead to significant uncertainties in determining radiative forcing and furthermore the climate feedbacks.\nIn this study, we introduce recent analyses of dusty clouds using CALIPSO satellite observations, which can provide vertical profiles of aerosols and cloud. We will use six years of CALIPSO data and focus on characterizing the global distributions of dusty clouds. We are particularly interested in the frequency of occurrence and seasonal variations of dusty cloud, cloud layer and dust layer geometrical height and thickness, and the vertical distribution of the mixed layer over the globe.",

            "abstract": "Bats in agroecosystems around California’s Central Coast:\nA full quarter of California’s land area is farmland. Crops account for $32.5 billion of California’s GDP. Insect control is a big problem for farmers, and California bats eat only insects, saving farmers an estimated $3 to $53 billion a year.\nAs farmers maximize crop yield, they use more pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers, which contaminate runoff streams that bats drink from. Also, pesticide use kills bats’ sole food source: insects.\nMy research objective was to find out how farm management practices and landscape complexity affect bat diversity and activity, and to see which one affects bat activity more. We monitored 18 sites, including conventional, organic, and low and high-complexity landscapes. We noted more bat activity at sites with high complexity landscapes and organic practices than at sites with either low-complexity landscapes or conventional farming practices. I captured and processed bats and recorded data. I also classified insects collected from light traps.\nI learned how to handle bats and measure forearm length and weight, as well as how to indentify their gender. I took hair clippings and fecal samples, which yield data about the bats’ diet. Their diet, in turn, gives us data about which pests they eat and therefore help control. I also learned about bats’ echolocation: they have a special muscle over their ears that closes when they echolocate so that they don’t burst their own eardrum. Also, some insects have evolved a special call that will disrupt bats echolocation so bats can’t track it.\n ",

            "abstract": "Boreal forests are experiencing significant changes in climate and disturbance regimes, including increases in the frequency and severity of fires. Fires impact the carbon (C) cycle of this region in many ways, including through changes to C inputs to the ecosystem (i.e., loss of all living vegetation, followed post-fire regrowth), changes in mycorrhizal relationships, the altering soil temperature and moisture regimes, and the charring of surface organic soil. All of these factors have the potential to impact decomposition rates. We were interested in comparing the relative importance of changes in soil temperature and moisture (soil environmental conditions) versus surface organic soil quality (charring) on decomposition rates. To disentangle the effects of environmental factors versus charring on mass loss, we performed a reciprocal transplant experiment. Our design included burned and unburned feather moss litter, collected from the field and placed within litterbags, which were then placed into triplicate burned and unburned black spruce dominated stands in interior Alaska. Litterbags were collected after one, three, and seven years, after which mass loss and changes in C and N pools were quantified. Exponential decomposition (k) values varied with litter type (burned/unburned) by environment (burned/unburned site) interactions. Averaged across both types of environments, decomposition rates were almost double for unburned versus burned litter. Decomposition rates were approximately 30 percent faster for unburned versus burned sites. Our results to date show that changes to soil quality due to charring have a larger effect in controlling post-burn decomposition rates than changes in soil environmental conditions.",

In this study, we investigated the mesoscale eddies in detail from the viewpoint of eddy-eddy interaction. This is because eddy-eddy interactions are scarcely observed in the ocean and are still open question. In particular in this study, we investigated global distribution of mergers and splits of mesoscale eddy through analysis of 20-year time series of satellite altimeter data distributed by AVISO. Neighbor enclosed area tracking algorithm, which is able to detect mergers and splits of mesoscale eddies, was applied to track each eddy identified using Okubo-Weiss parameter. The frequency of mergers and splits of mesoscale eddies varied from area to area: both mergers and splits frequently occurred in the areas of western boundary currents and their extensions, subtropical counter currents, and Antarctic Circumpolar Current regions.",

            "abstract": "Well-preserved terrestrial fossils, mainly including conifers, cycads and ferns, were discovered from the Tabbowa beds in northwestern Sri Lanka. The high diversity and abundance of plants and insects from these Jurassic sediments provide a unique window to understand floral evolution and plant-insect co-evolution in the Mesozoic. For example, unearthed fossils from the Tabbowa beds indicate that leaf feeding and dwelling insects played a significant role in the Jurassic ecosystem. For another example, feeding and chewing marks on leaves allow studying insect behavior and paleo-ecology. Additionally, the recent discoveries of Otozamites latiphyllus and Otozamites tabbowensis from these sediments provide evidence that Bennettitales, an extinct order of seed plants, widely spread in the Gondwana during the Jurassic period. Although most fossils are yet to be well studied, and only few of the fossil occurrences have been published in western journals, plant fossils from the Tabbowa beds have great potential for substantially increasing our knowledge of Jurassic terrestrial ecosystems. The fossil-bearing Tabbowa beds are mainly composed of sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone with occasional thin bands of nodular limestone. Until now, radio-isotopic age determinations for the fossil-rich Tabbowa beds are lacking. In this study, we investigate the geological and geochronological setting of this area by dating detrital zircons from the Tabbowa beds. The age data will allow testing several hypotheses regarding the plant evolution, the basin development of this region.",

            "abstract": "The variability in outlet glacier termini positions is an important indicator of overall glacier health and the net effects of ice-ocean-atmosphere interactions. Glacier margins fluctuate on both seasonal and interannual time scales, and owing to logistical difficulties associated with field observations, satellite imagery provides a critical spatially- and temporally-extensive resource for monitoring glacier behavior. In general, outlet glacier termini have been retreating globally over recent decades, but the magnitude of seasonal variation and overall retreat has proven unique to each glacier. The outlet glaciers in central West Greenland are generally experiencing the same regional atmospheric forcing, yet previous studies have shown varying magnitudes of retreat over the last forty years. Such observations point to the importance of local-scale forcing on outlet glacier dynamics. In this study, we utilized Landsat imagery between the years 1985 and 2014 to digitize a time series of glacier front positions of 18 outlet glaciers in the Disko and Uummannaq Bay regions of West Greenland. We additionally examined glacier terminus dynamics in context with proximal sea ice conditions (using SMMR, SSM/I and AMSR-E passive microwave-based sea ice concentrations) to assess the potential influence of ice mélange on terminus behavior. High-resolution WorldView satellite-based digital elevation models provide ancillary data that allow for investigation of the influence of ice mélange thickness on outlet glacier behavior across the region. Our findings suggest that the magnitude of seasonal variation in terminus position can be indicative of longer-term trends in glacier behavior. Furthermore, our results indicate that that duration of sea ice cover acts as a limiting force on the ability of a glacier to accelerate until the clearing of its mélange-filled fjord. These findings underscore the importance of glacier and fjord geometries in modulating glacier retreat across West Greenland.",

            "abstract": "Although Papua New Guinea is relatively young in geological terms, it lies in a complex tectonic setting of oblique convergence between the Pacific and Australian plates, and trapped between the converging Ontong Java Plateau of the Pacific plate and the Australian continent. This complex setting combined with a lack of regional quantitative datasets has led to uncertainty in the timing and nature of major terrane forming events. The Maramuni arc represents the only continuous record of the tectonic evolution of Papua New Guinea during the Miocene, and hence provides an opportunity to gain insight into subduction dynamics, orogenesis and crustal processes that operated throughout this dynamic period. We present an integrated U-Pb geochronology, Hf isotope and geochemical investigation of the Maramuni arc utilizing a suite of intrusive rocks from the eastern Papuan Highlands that span the Late Miocene from ca. 12 Ma to 6 Ma. Northward dipping subduction beneath Papua New Guinea and early Maramuni arc activity is disrupted by arrival of the Australian continent at the trench from 12 Ma. The magmatic rocks formed from ca. 12–9 Ma have compositional affinities of subduction-zone magmas, but record increasing incompatible trace element contents and decreasing εHf with time, which we interpret to reflect a progressive increase in the crustal component of the magmas. Subsequent porphyry suites emplaced at 7.5-6 Ma are distinct from the older magmatic rocks by their marked HREE-depletion, which reflects a dramatic shift in arc-mantle dynamics. This is interpreted as break-up of the subducted slab and crustal delamination, and is marked by a second phase of uplift in the New Guinea Orogen. These results provide insights into the processes of continent collision and the expression of such processes in the geological record with potential applications in ancient convergent margins.",

            "abstract": "The Chijiawan creek, located in the mountains of Central Taiwan with a strongly seasonal hydrology, high discharge and sediment yields, is the only habitat in Taiwan of the endangered Formosan landlocked salmon. The 13-m-high No. 1 Check Dam was the largest and lowermost barrier on Chijiawan creek built in 1972. After forty years, the dam had 4-m scouring holes below its foundation, raising a significant risk of dam failure. Due to the safety concern and habitat restoration, the Shei-Pa National Park removed the dam in late May 2011. This paper documents the channel evolution after its removal by focusing on understanding the geomorphic responses to sediment processes and complexities of hydrological processes.\nWe collected the hourly discharge data of a Taipower gaging station located 6.8 km from the dam from 2010 to 2013 and conducted surveys of grain size distributions, cross-sectional and longitudinal profiles, and carried out repeat photography. One month after dam removal, a one-year event (Typhoon Meari) excavated a wedge of sediment from the impoundment. The knickpoint migrated to 200 m upstream from the dam and about 20,000 m3 of sediment had eroded from the reservoir. The profile remained pretty much unchanged until a year after in June 2012. Following a 20-year event (Typhoon Saola) in August 2012, the highest flow after dam removal to present, the channel significantly changed and the knickpoint migrated to 800 m upstream to the dam. The cumulative eroded amount increased to 150,000 m3, about three-thirds of the former impounded sediment. After a 5-year event (Typhoon Soulik) later on in July 2013, the knickpoint did not show much difference and the eroded amount of impounded sediment only increased 10,000 m3. However, the surveyed cross-sections showed obvious channel form changes and thalweg migration. It is likely that the entire bed was mobilized during the earlier high flows (Typhoon Saola), resulting in more easily mobilized bed material.\nAs many dams in Taiwan are located in steep mountainous area with highly variable hydrologic condition, we anticipate the observations will help enhancing future similar dam removal projects.",

            "abstract": "Lignin as a biomarker in soils, peat, lakes and intertidal and marine sediment cores has been widely researched in the last four decades. The biogeochemical processes controlling their distribution and composition include fractionation due to phase changes, mineral binding, and abiotic and biotic decay. However, there appears to be no studies in the literature describing the concentration and composition of lignin in groundwater aquifers, despite lignin tracing having the potential to differentiate between types of vegetation and recharge source. In the latter case aquifers could potentially be a source of old, degradation resistant lignin. In this study, we characterise the lignin composition in groundwater samples from a coastal sand aquifer, in SE Australia. We compare these data with lignin composition of fresh vegetation samples from the study site, and with lignin data from other environments in the literature. Groundwater samples were also analysed for Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) and inorganic chemistry (major ions, Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) and redox sensitive species) to investigate lignin fractionation processes. To achieve this, the groundwater lignin composition was compared to the total DOC and DIC in the samples and the prevailing redox reactions. The lignin composition in groundwater was found to be unrelated to the surrounding surface vegetation, indicating significant alteration by biogeochemical processes along its flow paths. We identify potential lignin degradation zones, via determination of total OC consumed through redox reactions and microbial activity. In conclusion, this study, by closely examining the correlations of lignin phenols in groundwater with lignin in surface waters, as well as biogeochemical processes in the aquifer is shedding a new light on the ability of lignin as a biomarker in these subsurface systems. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to assess the usefulness of lignin as a tracer in groundwater.",

            "abstract": "Deep tectonic tremor has been observed at several major plate-bounding faults around the Pacific Rim. Tremor­ in these regions can be triggered by small stresses arising from solid earth tides as well as passing seismic waves of large, distant earthquakes. While large, distant earthquakes are capable of repeatedly triggering tremor in the same region (i.e., a sweet spot), it is less understood how intraslab earthquakes interact with sweet spot tremor areas. We conduct a systematic survey of tremor triggered in the Nankai subduction zone by intraslab earthquakes to better understand what governs fault slip along the Eurasian-Philippine Sea Plate boundary. We examine 3 tremor sweet spots in the Nankai subduction zone: Shikoku West, Kii North, and Tokai. In each region, we select earthquakes from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) catalog that occur from mid-2009 to mid-2014 with magnitude (M) greater than 2, that occur within the down-going Philippine Sea Plate, and within a 300 km epicentral distance of the sweet spot region. Using these selection criteria, we obtain ~1,200 earthquakes in each region. We examine a tremor catalog immediately before and after these local events as well as visually inspect filtered waveforms from short-period Hi-net seismic stations surrounding the sweet spot areas to identify additional tremor signals. From our initial analysis, we have identified 18 clear cases of increased tremor activity immediately following intraslab earthquakes in Shikoku West, most of which occur down-dip of the Shikoku West sweet spot. In comparison, we have identified only 5 triggering earthquakes in Kii North, and our investigation at Tokai is still ongoing. Our results so far are in agreement with triggering susceptibility being dependent upon background activity rates, as has been suggested for remote triggering of microearthquakes in geothermal regions by large, distant earthquakes as well as for remotely triggered tremor in the Nankai subduction zone. Next, we plan to evaluate whether the observed triggering cases reflect a true causal relationship between intraslab earthquakes and interplate tremors or if the observations are due to coincidence. By doing so, we aim to better understand the physical mechanisms responsible for the triggering of the sweet spot tremor in the Nankai subduction zone.",

In this study, three sets of graphite-saturated experiments have been performed at 3 GPa and 1600 °C to investigate the effects of oxygen fugacity (fO2), sulfur, silicon, and water on the dissolution and partitioning of carbon between Fe-rich alloy melt and silicate melt. The results show that the presence of 0-5 wt% sulfur in alloy melt does not have considerable effect on carbon solubility (~5.6 wt%) in alloy melt, whereas the presence of 0-10 wt% silicon decreases it from ~5.6 wt% to 1.8 wt%. Carbon solubility (11-192 ppm) in silicate melt is strongly controlled by fO2 and the bulk water content. Decreasing fO2 from IW-0.6 to IW-4.7 or increasing bulk water content from 0.07 to 0.55 wt% results in significant increase of carbon solubility in silicate melt. Raman and FTIR spectroscopy of silicate glasses show that the carbon species is mostly methane, confirmed by the positive correlation between carbon and non-hydroxyl hydrogen in silicate melt. The decreases from 4600 to 180 with decreasing fO2 or increasing bulk water in silicate melt. In addition, increasing Si in metallic alloy melt also decreases .\nOur results show that fO2 and silicate melt bulk water contents play an important role in the fractionation of carbon in planetary MO. A reduced, hydrous MO may have led to a considerable fraction of carbon retained in the silicate mantle, whereas an oxidized, dry MO may have lost almost its entire carbon to the core. If delivery of bulk Earth carbon predominantly occurred after >90% of accretion, i.e., in a relatively oxidized MO (IW-2 to IW-1), then with applicable >1000, most carbon would also enter the segregating core. Finally, the predominance of methane in reduced silicate melt with fO2 below IW-1 also indicates that degassing of a hydrous, solidifying MO may have created a reduced early atmosphere, and degassing from lunar and Martian mantle may have released much more methane than carbon dioxide.",

However at present, rainfall can only be forecast with useful skill up to the lead times of few months. With the recent advancement in observational and methodological capabilities like the phase five of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), which provides simulations of near term climate (10 - 30 year predictions/ hindcasts) including observation based initializations, it may be possible to attain improved predictability of rainfall on longer timeframes.\nSea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) climate indices in the tropical Pacific and the Indian Ocean have been shown to be statistically significant predictors of seasonal rainfall in the Indo-Pacific region. This study evaluates the predictability of seven such SSTA climate indices from the decadal hindcast experiments of four state-of-the-art climate models. A Monte Carlo (MC) scheme is applied to assess the lead time till which these CMIP5 models are able to predict, with some skill, the evolution of these indices. The effect of applying a simple lead time dependent bias correction and the models’ capabilities in simulating two specific El Niño events (1982 and 1997), in terms of related indices, is also analysed.\nEl Niño related indices like the Niño 3, 3.4 and 4 were found to have improved predictability up to 20 months whereas indices for the Indian Ocean Dipole (DMI) was as low as 4 months. Bias correction clearly improves the predictability for all the indices. Further, the models simulate the observed peaks (1982 and 1997) in the Niño 3 and Niño 3.4 indices, in relation to the El Niños in these years, with limited success. No conclusion could, however, be made regarding which model performs better overall. Investigation of rainfall predictability is in progress and would be presented later.",

Human modifications have the potential to significantly alter controls on carbon dynamics. This study focused on determining carbon emissions (CO2 and CH4) from geographically isolated peatlands within the Ob-Tom River Interfluve area of Western Siberia affected by water diversion for municipal use by the city of Tomsk, Russia. Two oligotrophic wetlands within the study area were selected for site-specific CO2 studies, the Timiryazevskoe (16 ha) and Kirsanovskoe wetlands (29 ha), both affected by the Tomsk water intake (177 water wells 250 000 m3 water daily). Measurements of СО2 and CH4 emissions from peat surfaces were carried out bi-monthly in growing periods from 2008-2013 in two dominate vegetation zones, pine- shrub-sphagnum phytocenosis (ryam) and sedge-sphagnum fens. СО2 emissions were measured using OPTOGAS-500.4 infrared gas analyzer and dark chamber. Methane emissions were measured using static chamber method. Air samples were collected by syringes and analyzed at gas chromatograph Shimadzu-GC14B. Observations were accompanied by measurement of air temperature and humidity, surface temperature, peat temperature at various depths and the water table level. CО2 emission over the vegetative growing period had clearly pronounced seasonal dynamics with maximum values in the middle of the growing season (mid-July) and minimum values in spring and autumn. The average total flux over the studied period is 123±55 gС/m2 at sedge-sphagnum fen of Kirsanovskoe wetland and 323±66 gС/m2 at fen of Timiryazevskoe wetland. Total СО2 flux for the snow-free period at ryam sites of Timiryazevskoe and Kirsanovskoe wetlands is 238±84 and 260±47 gС/m2 accordingly. Methane emission from the surface of isolated wetlands for the snow-free period varies from 0.3±1.1 to 2.9±2.3 gC/m2 on ryam sites of Kirsanovskoe and Timiryazevskoe wetlands respectively. The total CH4 flux on sedge-sphagnum fen varies from 2.5±3.0 at Kirsanovskoe wetlands to 31.6±26.3 gC/m2 at Timiryazevskoe wetland.",

In this study we use the NPP–MAR (mean annual rainfall) relationship observed in tropical forests to evaluate the performance (20th century) and predictions (21st century) of tropical NPP from ten Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) Earth System Models (ESMs). Most of the CMIP5 models showed an increase in NPP concurrent with an increase in rainfall and a decrease in surface solar radiation. Models that better represented the NPP–MAR pattern did not better represent the climate, and vice versa. By the end of the 21st century the models that best reproduced the observed NPP–MAR relationship projected an increases in NPP between ~2% (RCP 4.5) and ~19% (RCP 8.5) relative to current observations (11.88±5 MgC ha-1 yr-1, 327 field sites) and increases of ~9% and ~25% relative to historical simulations (2005). By separating the effects of climate forcing and CO2 fertilization models showed that maximum productivity is likely occurring during the current climate, but this signal is masked by increases in NPP due to CO2 fertilization. Further studies addressing the individual and simultaneous effect of other climate variables on NPP are needed.",

            "abstract": "Seismic tomography of subduction zones suggests that slabs of oceanic lithosphere can accumulate at the base of the mantle transition zone (MTZ), and primary mantle plumes originating in the lower mantle often pick up a geochemical signature of deeply recycled crust as they transit through the MTZ on their way to form hot-spot related chains of ocean-islands. Here we report the results of phase equilibria experiments on natural starting materials representative of \"continental sediment\" with variable amounts of H2O present (0.8, 3.3, and 6.0 wt%), carried out in the multi-anvil apparatus at pressures appropriate to the base of the MTZ (~23-24 GPa), and temperatures ~1200-1600°C. At the lowest H2O contents , the phase assemblage consists of K-hollandite (KAlSi3O8)+Ti-perovskite (Mg,Fe)(Si,Al,Ti)O3+Stishovite (SiO2)+Corundum (Al2O3)+H2O-Fluid, but in the presence of modest amounts of water (~3-6 wt%), K-hollandite and Ti-perovskite break down to form an assemblage comprised of potassic NAL-phase (KAlSiO4)+Stish+H2O-rich melt. This suggests that K-rich NAL-phase will form in deeply subducted continental material by a peritectic melting reaction of the general form: KAlSi3O8 ↔ KAlSiO4 + 2·SiO2. Ti-perovskite also participates as a reactant phase, and significant substitution of Fe, Mg, and Ti into the crystal structure of the new NAL-phase is observed. The reconstructed compositions of K-rich NAL-phase inclusions in (ultradeep) diamonds from the base of the MTZ closely resemble those of the potassic NAL-phases produced in our experiments, providing direct evidence for recycling of \"continental\" material to the base of the MTZ and a hydrous MTZ.\nThe elastic properties of K- and Na-bearing hollandite and NAL phases were also investigated using first principles simulations. Although preliminary calculations indicate that these phases have similar bulk and shear modulus at ambient conditions, the pressure derivative of the shear modulus for K-hollandite is lower than that for the K-NAL phase, due to the 2nd order phase-transition (from tetragonal to monoclinic space group symmetry) that K-hollandite undergoes at ~23-25 GPa. Thus, the breakdown of K-hollandite to NAL phase and stishovite is likely to cause an increase in the shear wave velocity of sediment lithologies at the base of the MTZ.",

A mechanistic leaf nitrogen allocation model have been developed for a DOE-sponsored Community Land Model coupled to the Ecosystem Demography model (CLM-ED) to predict the photosynthetic capacity [Vc,max25 (µmol CO2 m-2 s-1)] under different environmental conditions at the global scale. We collected more than 800 data points of photosynthetic capacity (Vc,max25) for 124 species from 57 studies with the corresponding leaf nitrogen content and environmental conditions (temperature, radiation, humidity and day length) from literature and the NGEE arctic site (Barrow). Based on the data, we found that environmental control of Vc,max25 is about 4 times stronger than the leaf nitrogen content. Using the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo simulation approach, we fitted the collected data to our newly developed nitrogen allocation model, which predict the leaf nitrogen investment in different components including structure, storage, respiration, light capture, carboxylation and electron transport at different environmental conditions. Our results showed that our nitrogen allocation model explained 52% of variance in observed Vc,max25 and 65% variance in observed Jmax25 using a single set of fitted model parameters for all species. Across the growing season, we found that the modeled Vc,max25 explained 49% of the variability in measured Vc,max25. In the context of future global warming, our model predicts that a temperature increase by 5oC  and the doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide reduced the Vc,max25 by 5%, 11%, respectively.",

In this case, advanced space construction technology against the distinctive lunar environment (i.e., atmosphereless, subgravity, different geology) becomes a key issue for consistent and reliable settlement of human beings. Thus, understandings on the lunar surface and its composition must be secured as an important role in lunar development. During project Apollo (1961~1972), only 320 kg of real lunar soils were collected and sent to the Earth. Due to the lack of samples, many space agencies are attempting to simulate the lunar soil using Earth materials to be used in large and massive practical studies and simulations. In the same vein, we developed a Korean lunar simulant from a specific basalt type Cenozoic Erathem in Korea. The simulated regolith sample shows a high similarity to the Apollo average samples in mineral composition, density, and particle shape aspects. Therefore, the developed regolith simulant is expected to be used in various lunar exploration purposes.",

From east to west, they are the North Mein-Hua Submarine Canyon, Mein-Hua Submarine Canyon and the Keelung Valley. To the east of the Mein-Hua Submarine Canyon, the slope of the continental margin is quite gentle, implying that the risk of slope instability is low. However, between the Keelung Valley and the Mei-Hua Submarine Canyon, the slope is rather steep. We have conducted multi-channel reflection seismics, sub-bottom profilers and multi-beam bathymetry in this area. The results show two general trends of fracture or faulting. The NE-SW trending faults generally follow the major orientation of the Taiwan mountain belt. Thus, these faults could be reverse faults from the former collisional thrust faults to currently post-collisional normal faults. Another almost E-W trending faults are consistent with the N-S extending of the Southern Okinawa Trough. Because the most significant faulting in the northwest end of the study is probably associated with the offshore extension of the Kenchiao Fault or the Sanchiao Fault, we consider either of these two faults as the northeast boundary (headwall) of the potential submarine landslide. Taking the stability slope angle of 0.5 degree as the stable landslide slope as shown in the area to the northeast of the study area, we estimate the total volume of the potential submarine landslide could be 300 cubic kilometers. Such a landslide volume may generate a local tsunami and affect especially the northeast coast of Taiwan.",

Since clouds can exert a dominant control on planetary radiation balance, rotation rate could be critical for determining mean planetary climate. Here we investigate this idea using a three-dimensional general circulation model with a sophisticated cloud scheme. We find that slowly rotating planets (like Venus) can maintain an Earth-like climate at nearly twice the stellar flux as rapidly rotating planets (like Earth). This suggests that many exoplanets previously believed to be too hot may actually be habitable, depending on their rotation rate. A particularly striking example of the importance of rotation rate suggested by our simulations is that a planet with modern Earth's atmosphere, in Venus' orbit, and with modern Venus' (slow) rotation rate would be habitable. This would imply that if Venus went through a runaway greenhouse, it had a higher rotation rate at that time.\nThe explanation for this behavior is that slowly rotating planets have a weak Coriolis force and long daytime illumination, which promotes strong convergence and convection in the substellar region. This produces a large area of optically thick clouds, which greatly increases the planetary albedo. In contrast, on rapidly rotating planets a much narrower belt of clouds form in the deep tropics, leading to a relatively low albedo. The different spatial patterns of clouds causes the inner edge of the the habitable zone around stars to depend strongly on the planetary rotation rate (Figure 1 below).",

            "abstract": "The characteristics of Lishan Fault or its existence has been under controversies in the past decade, leading to the arguments for the orogenesis of Taiwan. To better describe the subsurface structures in central Taiwan, we conducted a well-conditioned joint inversion of P-wave (Vp) and S-wave velocity (Vs) structures to explore detailed local structures and discontinuities in higher resolution. The results show that the Lishan Fault can be well delineated by a prominent velocity contrast subvertically. A high velocity body enclosed by Vp = 6.0 km/s is exhumed under the eastern Hsuehshan Range and right stop by the Lishan Fault on the east, demonstrating that the basement uplift in central Taiwan is bounded/controlled by the Lishan Fault, as a boundary fault. Parts of the high-velocity body also characterized with high Vp/Vs ratio area may indicate the mafic bodies related to the ancient rifting event. Furthermore, in 3D geometry, we found that this exhumed body that branches into the area in between two closely located Nantou earthquakes in 2013 may serve as a reason for the separating distribution of their aftershocks. Such findings could shed a light on the complicated orogenic tectonics and the hazard mitigation in the central Taiwan.\nKey words: Lishan Fault, Nantou earthquakes, Basement uplift, Mountain building",

            "abstract": "The Izu-Bonin (Ogasawara) arc is an intra-oceanic island arc along the convergent plate boundary between the subducting Pacific and overriding Philippine Sea plates. Recent active seismic studies in the Izu-Bonin arc reveal significant along-arc variations in crustal structure [Kodaira et al., 2007]. The thickness of the arc crust shows a remarkable change between thicker Izu (~30 km) and thinner Bonin (~10 km) arcs. In addition to this, several geological and geophysical contrasts, such as seafloor topography and chemical composition of volcanic rocks, between Izu and Bonin arc have been reported [e.g., Yuasa 1992]. We have conducted earthquake observations using ocean bottom seismographs (OBSs) to reveal seismic velocity structure of the crust and mantle wedge in the Izu-Bonin arc and to investigate origin of the along-arc structure variations. We deployed 40 short-period OBSs in Izu and Bonin area in 2006 and 2009, respectively. The OBS data were processed with seismic data recorded at routine seismic stations on Hachijo-jima, Aoga-shima, and Chichi-jima operated by National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED). More than 5000 earthquakes were observed during about three-months observation period in each experiment. We conducted three-dimensional seismic tomography using manually picked P- and S-wave arrival time data. The obtained image shows a different seismic velocity structures in the mantle beneath the volcanic front between Izu and Bonin arcs. Low P-wave velocity anomalies in the mantle beneath the volcanic front in the Izu arc are limited at depths deeper than those in the Bonin arc. On the other hand, P-wave velocity in the low velocity anomalies beneath volcanic front in the Bonin arc is slower than that in the Izu arc. These large-scale along-arc structure variations in the mantle could relate to the geological and geophysical contrasts between Izu and Bonin arcs.",

            "abstract": "The need to promote ethical practice in the geosciences has long been recognized. Governmental boards for licensing professional geoscientists commonly require participation in continuing-education courses or workshops about professional ethics as part of the license-renewal processes. Geoscience-based companies and organizations of professional geoscientists have developed ethical codes for their members or employees. Ethical problems have been reported that involve the practice of science applied to Earth studies, interpersonal relationships within geoscience departments, business practices in geoscience-based companies, field work and the destructive modification of geologic sites, public policy development or implementation related to Earth resources, extractive resource industries, development that modifies landscapes in significant ways, interactions with the press and other media professionals, and even interactions with individuals or groups that have a significantly different worldview.\nWe are working toward the creation of a modular semester-long course in GeoEthics. The modules will be free-standing, so each could be repurposed for use in a different course; however, the GeoEthics course will provide a useful overall introduction to a variety of topics in ethics applied in the context of geoscience. Such a course might be an excellent capstone course for undergraduate geoscientists, or an introductory course for graduate students. The first module will cover basics intended to provide a common vocabulary of words, ideas and practices that will be used throughout the course. The remaining 5-6 modules will focus on aspects of geoscience in which ethical considerations play an important role. We feel that the geoscience classroom can provide a safe, controlled environment in which students can confront a representative sample of the types of ethical issues they might encounter in their professional or academic careers. Our goal is to help students develop effective strategies for working through these dilemmas. Our modules will utilize formal discussion, role-playing, debate, and reflective writing, among other techniques. We hope that this will lead students to internalize these lessons so that they lead careers in which ethical practice is an essential element.",

            "abstract": "Details of the formation and evolution of continents, especially in cratonic regions, remains poorly understood. Structural layering in the cratonic lithosphere is of particular importance due to competing hypotheses of craton formation, which include underplating by hot plumes or accretion by shallow subduction in continental or arc settings. One source of evidence that provides constraints on these hypotheses is seismic anisotropy, which is generally attributed to past and present rock deformation in the upper mantle. Anisotropic structure can be constrained from surface wave dispersion (SWD), which is sensitive to the uppermost portion of the mantle, and core refracted shear wave (SKS) splitting measurements, which add constraints on the integrated effect across the entire upper mantle.\nAnother source of evidence involves receiver function (RF) analysis which can detect sharp changes in seismic velocities. Fine scale layering in the lithosphere has recently become a topic of interest due to the detection of a sharp velocity reduction at 80-120 km depth across cratonic provinces in North America (NA). This has sparked debate on whether RF studies are in fact detecting the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary or a mid-lithospheric discontinuity within the older cratonic provinces. The NA craton is of interest due to its rich tectonic history as well as data accumulation at broadband seismic networks including USArray, which provides a dense network coverage that allows for high resolution seismic velocity and structure models in the upper mantle.\nWe present a transdimensional Monte Carlo Markov chain inversion, in which the number of isotropic and anisotropic layers are considered to be unknowns, allowing the algorithm to have a flexible parameterization. The method performs a joint inversion that combines observations from SKS splitting, RF and anisotropic SWD in a consistent manner. The solution is a probabilistic shear velocity (Vs) model that accounts for azimuthal anisotropy. One advantage of this method is that it combines datasets of varying levels of noise and depth sensitivities, without the need to balance the contribution of each dataset in the inversion. Synthetic and real tests are done to resolve structure down to a depth of 350 km beneath seismic stations in North America.",

            "abstract": "The greenhouse gas observing satellite “GOSAT” launched in January 2009 has been observing global distribution of CO2 and CH4. The TANSO-FTS mounted on GOSAT measures the two polarized components (called “P” and “S”) of short wavelength infrared (SWIR) spectrum reflected from the earth’s surface. In NIES, column-averaged dry air mole fraction of CO2 and CH4 (XCO2 and XCH4) are retrieved from SWIR spectra. However, the observed polarization information is not effectively utilized in the retrieval process due to the large computational cost of a vector RT model, instead the polarization synthesized spectra and a scalar RT model are used in the operational processing. An optical path length modification due to aerosol scattering is known as the major error source for XCO2 and XCH4 retrieval from SWIR spectra. Because the aerosol scattering changes polarization state of light, more accurate or additional aerosol information is expected by using the observed polarization spectra effectively in the retrieval process, which improves the retrieval accuracy of XCO2 and XCH4. In addition, for information content analysis, sensitivity analysis and error analysis, Jacobian matrix is important onto retrieval algorithm design before analyses for actual observed data. However, in the case of using RT model including polarization effect in retrieval process, the computational cost of Jacobian matrix calculations in maximum a posteriori retrieval is significantly large. Efficient calculation of analytical Jacobian is necessary.\nAs a first step, we are implementing an analytical Jacobian calculation function to the vector RT model “Pstar”. RT scheme of Pstar is based on hybrid method comprising the discrete ordinate and matrix operator methods. The reflection/transmission matrices and source vectors are obtained for each vertical layer through the discrete ordinate solution, and the vertically inhomogeneous system is constructed using the matrix operator method. Because the delta-M truncation method is used in the Pstar to reduce the computational cost, single scattering component correction called TMS method is implemented. Calculation of analytical Jacobian has to be constructed above the RT scheme. We will show the formulation and some results of the analytical Jacobian implementation at the presentation.",

They offer benefits, such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions, energy security, and local development, yet produce negative social and ecological impact, such as wildlife habitat destruction, human displacement, and the disruption of downstream fishing or agricultural industries. In the past decade, the Indian government has signed Memoranda of Understanding with hydroelectric power companies for the building of over 130 large dams on the Brahmaputra River in the state of Arunachal Pradesh in Northeast India. These dams can generate 43% of India’s assessed hydropower potential to sustain India’s growing economy. In addition, the Indian government claims that these dams will bring local development with needed jobs. However, local Arunachali people have protested and temporarily halted hydropower projects because of the impact of dams on their existing livelihoods.\nUsing the North Eastern Electric Power Corporation’s (NEEPCO) Ranganadi Hydroelectric Project as a case study, our project examined whether dams in Northeast India provide jobs for local people, and whether distance from the dam or work colony to a worker's hometown affects the type of job the worker received. Survey data from residents at NEEPCO’s work colony in Doimukh, Arunachal Pradesh, was analyzed using SPSS (n = 18). Our research found that 100% of workers at the dam originally resided in Northeast India, with 33% from Arunachal Pradesh, and 67% from the nearby states of Assam, and Tripura. Further, our analysis revealed no statistically significant relationship between the distance to a worker’s hometown and job type (p = .609). Where workers come from did not affect the type of job they received. More research using a larger sample size and additional hydroelectric project case studies is needed to further explore the relationship between worker home location and their job types.",

            "abstract": "Traditional mathematical descriptions of multiphase flow in porous media rely on a multiphase extension of Darcy’s law, and lead to nonlinear second-order (advection-diffusion) partial differential equations for fluid saturations. Here, we study horizontal redistribution of immiscible fluids. The traditional Darcy-flow model predicts that the spreading of a finite amount of liquid in a horizontal porous medium never stops; a prediction that is not substantiated by observation. To help guide the development of new models of multiphase flow in porous media [1], we draw an analogy with the flow of thin films. The flow of thin films over flat surfaces has been the subject of much theoretical, experimental and computational research [2]. Under the lubrication approximation, the classical mathematical model for these flows takes the form of a nonlinear fourth-order PDE, where the fourth-order term models the effect of surface tension [3]. This classical model, however, effectively assumes that the film is perfectly wetting to the substrate and, therefore, does not capture the partial wetting regime. Partial wetting is responsible for stopping the spread of a liquid puddle.\nHere, we present experiments of (large-volume) liquid spreading over a flat horizontal substrate in the partial wetting regime, and characterize the spreading regimes that we observe. We extend our previous theoretical work of two-phase flow in a capillary tube [4], and develop a macroscopic phase-field model of thin-film flows with partial wetting. Our model naturally accounts for the dynamic contact angle at the contact line, and therefore permits modeling thin-film flows without invoking a precursor film, leading to compactly-supported solutions that reproduce the spreading dynamics and the static equilibrium configuration observed in the experiments. We anticipate that this modeling approach will provide a natural mathematical framework to describe spreading and redistribution of immiscible fluids in porous media.\nREFERENCES\n[1] L.

The samples consisted of sands sieved into different fractions ranging from a mean grain size of 1.0 mm to 0.125 mm. Although the occurrence in New Zealand natural sands of titomagnetite means that the magnitude of the SIP phase response is significantly greater than is generally found for “clean” sands, the peak in SIP phase shows a clear dependence on grain size. The SIP spectra have been represented in terms of a Cole-Cole model and the relaxation times derived from this show a strong linear correlation with the measured values of permeability. The SIP and permeability measurements are then extended to mixtures of sieved sands, sand with varying amount of clay, samples with varying amount of magnetic minerals and also natural samples from various locations in New Zealand.",

As uncertainty in isoprene-OH interaction from low to intermediate NO conditions has not been fully resolved yet, we will particularly highlight implications of uncertainty in OH levels to ozone production regimes and OVOC production potentials using an observationally constrained 0-D box model (UWCM v 2.1). Multiple scenarios such as different isopreneperoxy radical photochemistry schemes are adapted for the assessments. In addition, the evaluation of NO2 overestimation by a conventional chemiluminescence instrument with a Mo-converter routinely utilized NO2 observations in East Asia will be also discussed by comparing observational datasets from a Thermo 42i NOx analyzer and a LGR CRDS NO2 instrument from summer to fall. The discussion will be evolved to assess potential uncertainty caused by the overestimation from the previous regional photochemistry assessment studies.",

Although the accretion of the Guerrero terrane represents one of the major tectonic processes that shaped the southern North American Pacific margin, the stratigraphic record related to such a regional event was not yet recognized in central Mexico. Due to the Sierra de los Cuarzos is located just 50 km east of the Guerrero terrane suture belt, its stratigraphic record should be highly sensitive to first order tectonic changes and would record a syn-tectonic deposits related to this major event.\nIn that study area, were identified two main Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous clastic units. The Sierra de los Cuarzos formation represents the lowermost exposed stratigraphic record. Sedimentary structures, sandstones composition, and U-Pb detrital zircon ages document that the Sierra de los Cuarzos formation reflects a vigorous mass wasting along the margin of the North American continental mainland, representing the eastern side of the Arperos back arc basin. Sandstones of the Sierra de los Cuarzos formation are free from detrital contributions related to the Guerrero terrane juvenile sources, indicating that the Arperos Basin acted like an efficient sedimentological barrier that inhibited the influence of the arc massifs on the continental mainland deposits. The Sierra de los Cuarzos formation is overlain by submarine slope deposits of the Pelones formation, which mark a sudden change in the depositional conditions. Provenance analysis documents that sandstones from the Pelones formation were fed by the mafic to intermediate arc assemblages of the Guerrero terrane, as well as by quartz-rich sources of the continental mainland, suggesting that, by the time of deposition of the Pelones formation, the Arperos Basin was closed and the Guerrero terrane was juxtaposed to the continental domain. Based on these data, we interpret the Pelones formation as the record of the major crustal reorganization in central Mexico related to the inversion of the Arperos back arc basin and accretion of the Guerrero terrane to the continental mainland.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that, under the influence of planetary rotation, convective flows tend to have a two dimensional (2D) structure, with small variations along the direction of rotation. Because of the primary force balance between pressure gradients and the Coriolis force, such flows are termed geostrophic. Convective flows are never purely geostrophic because buoyancy (which powers convection) is necessarily present and so is viscous dissipation. Nevertheless, provided rotation is dominant, the first order 2D nature of convective flows is preserved and these flows are often referred to as quasi-geostrophic (QG). QG numerical models of thermal convection, in which only variations in axially averaged quantities are tracked, have been developed to take advantage of the predominant 2D structure of QG flows. These models can reproduce faithfully some of the features of fully three-dimensional (3D) numerical models. The chief advantage of such QG models is that, because of their 2D nature, a much higher numerical resolution is achievable than for 3D models for the same computing cost and can thus be used to study aspects of convection under a regime not accessible to 3D models. In existing QG models, the buoyancy force is restricted to its component perpendicular to the rotation axis and the modelled region of convection is limited to that outside the tangent cylinder. Here, we present an extension on these models by incorporating the axial component of the buoyancy force and by modelling convection inside the tangent cylinder. Our model can reproduce the salient features of 3D numerical models near onset. Further, our model also captures features of well developed, fully turbulent convection, such as production of zonal jets.",

            "abstract": "Forearc basins are loci of active sedimentation above the landward portion of accretionary prisms. Although these basins typically remain separated from the frontal prism by a forearc high, their evolution has a significant impact on the structure and deformation of the entire wedge. Formation of forearc basins has been proposed as a consequence of changes in wedge stability due to an increase of slab dip in subduction zones. Another hypothesis attributes this to higher hinterland sedimentation, which causes the rear of the wedge to stabilize and eventually develop a forearc basin. Basin stratigraphic architecture, revealed by high-resolution reflection seismic data and borehole data allows interpretation of structural development of the accretionary prism and associated basins with the goal of determining the underlying driving mechanism(s) of basin formation.\nIn this study we supplement data interpretation with thermo-mechanical numerical models including high-resolution isochronal surface tracking to visualize the developing stratigraphy of basins that develop in subduction zone and wedge dynamic models. We use a dynamic 2D thermo mechanical model incorporating surface processes, strain weakening and sediment subduction. The model is a modification of I2VIS model, which is based on conservative, fully staggered finite differences and a non-diffusive marker- in-cell technique capable of modelling mantle convection. In the model different driving mechanisms for basin formation can be explored. Stratigraphic simulations obtained by isochronal surface tracking are compared to reflection pattern and stratigraphy of seismic and borehole data, respectively. Initial results from a model roughly representing the Nankai Trough Subduction Zone offshore Japan are compared to available seismic and Integrated Ocean Drilling (IODP) data. A calibrated model predicting forearc basin stratigraphy will be used to discern the underlying process of basins formation and wedge dynamics.",

Then, 12 years that had the highest region-averaged SST values in the equatorial eastern Pacific (warm SST years) and 12 years that had the lowest SST values (cold SST years) were selected followed by analyzing average difference between two groups to identify any causes of possible correlation between SST in the equatorial eastern Pacific and TC frequency.\nIn the warm SST years, not only TC frequency that affected Korea but also TC genesis frequency was low as well as TC intensity. A difference of 500 hPa and 850 hPa streamlines between two groups showed that anomalous northwesterlies were strengthened in Korea due to anomalous cyclonic circulations developed in the mid-latitude region in East Asia so that such anomalous steering flows played a role in preventing TCs from moving to Korea. Furthermore, anomalous anticyclonic circulations were strengthened in the east of Taiwan, which was related to weakening of the monsoon trough thereby causing lowering TC genesis frequency in the warm SST years. In addition, as anomalous cyclonic circulations were strengthened in the southeast quadrant of the tropical and subtropical western North Pacific, it created high TC genesis frequency in the sea in the warm SST years.\nLow TC frequency, low TC genesis frequency, and low TC intensity that affected Korea in the warm SST years were clearly seen by the analysis of differences between two groups with respect to 500 hPa and 850 hPa air temperature, 600 hPa relative humidity, precipitable water, 200-850 hPa vertical wind shear and sea surface temperature.",

The proto-KCF is notable for (1) its long and complex history within, and perhaps preceding the Sierra Nevada batholith, and (2) hosting the Quaternary Kern Canyon Fault, an active fault that threatens the integrity of the Lake Isabella auxiliary dam and surrounding communities. We are investigating the internal architecture of the proto-KCF to explore its control on the likely behavior of the modern KCF. The proto-KCF is developed in the Alta Sierra biotite-granodiorite pluton. A traverse across Engineer’s Point, perpendicular to the proto-KCF trace, reveals gradational increases in fracture density, fracture length, bulk alteration, and decreases in fracture spacing and grain size toward the fault core. Mapping of the fault core reveals two prominent and laterally extensive zones: (1) continuous foliated blastomylonitic granodiorite with steeply-dipping, anastomosing shear bands and minor mylonite planes, and (2) foliated orange and green fault breccia with intergranular gouge, strong C/S fabric, and a central gouge plane. The fault breccia zone is intruded by a lensoidal, post-deformation dacite dike, probably ca. 105 – 102 Ma (Nadin & Saleeby, 2008) and is weakly overprinted by a set of cross-cutting spaced, short, brittle fractures, often coated in calcite, which we infer to be genetically related to the modern KCF.

Core recovery of this Site was nearly 100％ above 550m depth from the sea floor.\nBiostratigraphic data suggest that the absence of the section from 2.7 to 1.8 Ma occurred between core depths 503 m and 523 m. Therefore, samples were taken from the upper 503 m of the Site U1352 at intervals of ~1.5 m, which represent ~7000 years duration since 1.8 Ma based on the average sedimentation rate of this portion. Benthic foraminifera Nonionella flemingiwere picked from samples and we measured oxygen and stable carbon isotope ratios of them. We also measured the stable carbon isotope ratios of organic matter and total organic carbon contents (TOC).\nAn age model was generated based on correlations between oxygen isotope ratios of this study and LR04 stack. We compared among the fluctuation curves of oxygen isotope ratios, inorganic and organic stable carbon isotope ratios, and TOC, using the age model. Fluctuations of stable carbon isotope and TOC derived from marine organic matters generally synchronize with oxygen isotope and stable carbon isotope records derived from benthic foraminifera. However, we found time lags among the fluctuation curves in some sections.\nFluctuation curves stem from organic matter might be controlled by the local productivity of the ocean surface, while isotope ratios of benthic foraminifera test depend on global climate change, such as glacier and inter-glacier cycles. Combined analysis of stable carbon isotope ratios of inorganic material and organic matter are considered to be a powerful tool for understanding the paleoenvironments.",

            "abstract": "In the airborne electromagnetic survey, vast data are acquired with the development of precise measuring equipment and the automation of data acquisition. In this study we developed fast and accurate two-dimensional (2D) modeling and inversion algorithm based on the adaptive born forward mapping (ABFM) method, which is recently emerging for fast time-domain electromagnetic (TEM) modeling. The ABFM method is an approximation method that takes into consideration the true electrical conductivity distribution of subsurface media and is different from the conventional Born approximation that uses the constant electric conductivity. One of the most important points of the ABFM method is how to set a suitable sensitivity function. In this study, the known 1D sensitivity function was expanded into 2D sensitivity function to effectively approximate the dispersive behavior of electromagnetic field. By comparing the analytic solution and approximate ABFM solution for layered earth models, we found that the two solutions correspond to each other well. This implies that the 2D sensitivity function suggested in this study is suitable and that the ABFM method has very excellent accuracy in 2D TEM modeling even though it is an approximation method. Furthermore, a 2D inversion algorithm was developed with respect to the apparent conductivity data of TEM based on ABFM. To enhance the resolution and stability, the smoothness-constrained least-squares method with ACB constraint was employed. The inversion of calculated data for various models produced a reasonable model close to the true model. It is expected that the method will be extensively applicable to TEM modeling and inversion without difficulty in the future.",

In this study, we show that it is possible to capture the oscillatory ground motion (acceleration, velocity, displacement) induced by the Tohoku-Oki event for periods ranging from 3 to 100s by using GPS data processed in Precise Point Positioning (PPP) mode. We find that the ground motions of the sedimentary basins of Japan were large, corresponding to velocity and acceleration larger than 0.15m/s and 0.15m/s2 , respectively, even for periods greater than 3s. We compare the GPS observables with a Ground Motion Prediction Equation (GMPE) designed for Japan seismicity and find that the Spectral Acceleration (SA) is well estimated for periods larger than 3s and distances ranging from 100 to 500km. Finally, through the analysis of the displacement attenuation plots for the examined period band, we show that the 2011 Tohoku-Oki event is likely composed of multiple rupture patches as suggested before by time-reversal inversions of seismic data.",

            "abstract": "It is generally thought that a high beta shock is weak so that its structre is relatively laminar and stationary. Such low Mach number shocks have not been paid much attention in terms of particle acceleration. However, Voyager spacecraft revealed that the fluxes of not only the non-thermal ions, which are called as the termination shock particles, but also of the non-thermal electrons are enhanced at the crossings of the termination shock. The heliospheric termination shock has a high effective beta due to the presence of pickup ions which are the component having rather high thermal energy. Radio synchrotron emissions from relics of galaxy cluster mergers imply the presence of relativistic electrons accelerated in merger shocks. A plasma beta of such a merger shock is also thought to be rather high so that the merger shocks are usually assumed to have low Mach numbers. These observational facts imply that even a low Mach number shock can be a good accelerator of non-thermal particles. Here, we perform two-dimensional full particle-in-cell simulation to study microstructure of a high beta low Mach number shock and the associated electron acceleration process. Although the effective magnotosonic Mach number is rather low, ~2.6, the structure of the transition region is highly complex. Ion and electron scale structures coexist. Furthermore, some electrons are accelerated to high energy. We will discuss the mechanisms of producing those two-dimensional microstructures and high energy electrons.",

According to a recent first principles study (Yu et al., 2011), wadsleyite decomposes to an assemblage of majorite plus periclase with a large negative Clapeyron slope. Since stability field of majorite is limited to above ~2200 kelvin in a depth range of 500-660km for Mg2SiO4, very hot upwelling plumes are expected to be strongly influenced by the phase transitions related to majorite. These hot upwellings are occasionally observed in the simulations, even though the average temperature of hot plumes are far less than the stability field of majorite. The dynamics of these upwellings are modified by the release and the absorption of latent heat induced by the transitions as well as interruption of currents due to the large negative Clapayron slope related to majorite.",

            "abstract": "Mantle-derived potassic igneous rocks and carbonatites first appear in the geological record in the late Archean, coinciding with major crust-forming events on most continents. The compositions of potassic rocks require sources including discrete ultramafic rocks with phlogopite and pyroxenes, whereas carbonatites and ultramafic lamprophyres (carbonate-rich potassic rocks) require oxidizing conditions in which carbonate is stable. The presence of these source rocks from this time is probably related to the stabilization of mantle lithosphere. If mantle lithosphere had not been stable for considerable periods of time, then melting would be restricted to peridotite, which is not a viable option for strongly potassic rocks.\nThe phlogopite-rich source-rock assemblages that are necessary precursors for potassic melts could be introduced into the lithosphere by either subduction processes or by multiple stages of low-degree melting. Many modern examples involve subducted sedimentary material, which concentrates potassium by the stabilization of micas in subduction metamorphism. Subduction involves a great variety of redox states, but the bulk effect is the return of oxidized material from the surface into the mantle. However, we cannot apply uniformitarianism unthinkingly, because subduction processes at and before 2.7 Ga may have had different redox states. Before the Great Oxidation Event the distribution and abundances of geological formations such as banded iron formations, red beds, and uraninites indicate that geological reservoirs became gradually oxidized, preventing an earlier increase in atmospheric oxygen. This means that the function of the subduction process to oxidize the upper mantle by the return of oxidized rocks from the surface was much weaker in the early Earth. Early continental mantle lithosphere was, therefore, likely to accumulate carbon in reduced form, which would be more easily remobilized in melts through low-temperature redox melting much later in Earth history. Carbonate-rich alkaline rocks occur commonly during the rejuvenation of cratonic mantle, where carbonate melts tap carbon and mica-rich assemblages that may have slumbered in mantle lithosphere for extended periods of time.",

            "abstract": "Temperature, melt fraction, and water content affect seismic velocity and attenuation differently. Both are sensitive to temperature, but velocity is more sensitive to melt fraction and attenuation is thought to be more sensitive to water content. For these reasons, combining attenuation measurements with tomographic imaging of velocity structure can help untangle these fields and better resolve lithospheric structure and physical state. We map variations in attenuation beneath Spain and northern Morocco using teleseismic data generated by more than a dozen teleseismic deep-focus earthquakes recorded on a dense array of stations. For each event, we first estimate the source from the best quality recordings. We then apply an attenuation operator to the source estimate, using a range of t* values, to match the record at each station. We invert for a smooth map of t* from the ensemble of measurements. The spatial patterns in t* correlate very well with the tectonic domains in Spain and Morocco. In particular, areas in Spain that resisted deformation during the Variscan and Alpine orogenies produce very little attenuation. Comparing the attenuation map with seismic velocity structure we find that, in Morocco, some areas with strong low-velocity anomalies and recent volcanism do not cause high attenuation. These observations suggest that water content is a more likely cause for seismic attenuation in the study area than temperature, and that the non-attenuative low-velocity anomalies in Morocco are produced by partial mel.",

Contrary to some expectations, policy makers do sometimes make such long-term decisions, but not as commonly and successfully as climate change may require. In recent years however, the new capabilities of analytic decision support tools, combined with improved understanding of cognitive and organizational behaviors, has significantly improved the methods available for organizations to manage longer-term climate risks. In particular, these tools allow decision makers to understand what near-term actions consistently contribute to achieving both short- and long-term societal goals, even in the face of deep uncertainty regarding the long-term future. This talk will describe applications of these approaches for infrastructure, water, and flood risk management planning, as well as studies of how near-term choices about policy architectures can affect long-term greenhouse gas emission reduction pathways.",

            "abstract": "The evolution and dissipation of viscously accreting protoplanetary disks is a key element in understanding the formation of planetary systems. By investigating the timescales on which circumstellar disks are dispersed by photoevaporation from the central star, as well as the quantities and types of materials that remain, conclusions may be drawn regarding the likelihood of planet formation in the modeled disk system. Through the use of a one-dimensional viscous diffusion model for the disk, the photoevaporative dispersal of the disk mass is investigated under varied conditions. In this model, the dust and gas components are treated separately, and the effects of far-ultraviolet, extreme-ultraviolet, and x-ray irradiation are considered.\nIn this investigation, the surface density is affected by dynamics of the photoevaporative wind, of which different streamline models will be utilized (in addition to a control case with no wind calculation.) We present comparisons of the disk evolution and dispersion under these differing wind models in order to determine which results are in best agreement with observations, as well as to investigate the extent to which the streamline geometry affects photoevaporative mass loss rates and resulting disk lifetimes. Furthermore, we seek to explore the spatial distribution of remaining solids following the dispersal of the disk for each wind case. The spatial distribution and abundance of disk solids may determine the radial zones where comets, meteorites, and planetesimals may form in the wake of the dispersed disk. Additional inquiries for these differing wind conditions include: investigating line profiles of escaping gases, study of the evolving composition of remnant disk gas (an indicator of potential giant planet formation and composition), and exploring the evolution of snow lines in the modeled system.",

            "abstract": "The Australian Bureau of Meteorology operates a statistical seasonal streamflow forecasting service. It has also developed a dynamic seasonal streamflow forecasting approach. The two approaches produce similarly reliable forecasts in terms of ensemble spread but can differ in forecast skill depending on catchment and season. Therefore, it may be possible to augment the skill of the existing service by objectively weighting and merging the forecasts.\nBayesian model averaging (BMA) is first applied to merge statistical and dynamic forecasts for 12 locations using leave-five-years-out cross-validation. It is seen that the BMA merged forecasts can sometimes be too uncertain, as shown by ensemble spreads that are unrealistically wide and even bi-modal. The BMA method applies averaging to forecast probability densities (and thus cumulative probabilities) for a given forecast variable value. An alternative approach is quantile model averaging (QMA), whereby forecast variable values (quantiles) are averaged for a given cumulative probability (quantile fraction). For the 12 locations, QMA is compared to BMA.\nBMA and QMA perform similarly in terms of forecast accuracy skill scores and reliability in terms of ensemble spread. Both methods improve forecast skill across catchments and seasons by combining the different strengths of the statistical and dynamic approaches. A major advantage of QMA over BMA is that it always produces reasonably well defined forecast distributions, even in the special cases where BMA does not. Optimally estimated QMA weights and BMA weights are similar; however, BMA weights are more efficiently estimated.",

Therefore, a lot of focus has been to identify alternative distributed data sources, such as; remotely sensed data or global re-analysis data. Hence, this study uses the Water and Global Change (WATCH) forcing data, based on 40 years ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40), to model a semi-arid low land flood plain river basin in a data sparse region. The semi-distributed Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to model the river basin (Warrego, 52140.6 square km) located in the upper Murray-Darling basin in Eastern Australia. Multi station model calibration was achieved using the Sequential Uncertainty Fitting -2 (SUFI-2) algorithm with the Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) as the goal function against monthly observed flow data. Modelling of a low land river system is highly challenging, due to topographic heterogeneity, nonlinear climatic behavior and sparse observed flow data with extended periods of zero flows. Preliminary simulation results indicate a NSE of 0.26 to 0.86 for the calibration period and 0.04 to 0.47 for the validation period. Furthermore, the volume fraction explained by the model ranged from 0.69 to 2.71 in the validation period. While the unsatisfactory results may be attributed to the SWAT modelling framework, which struggles with modelling flow in flat flood plains, the study does reveal the potential to use remotely sensed data in low land river basins with little or no climate data.",

Otsuchi Bay is a narrow inlet running east-west, 8 km long and 2 km wide, and opens to the North Pacific on the east. Previous observational studies have suggested that water circulation in the bay is controlled by river discharges from the western boundary of the bay and two Pacific waters; one is a warm-saline water called Tsugaru Warm Water that is a branch of the Tsushima Warm Current in the Sea of Japan flowing through Tsugaru Strait, and the other is a cold-fresh water called Oyashio Water. It has been considered that there are two mechanisms of the Pacific waters’ intrusion into the bay; horizontal advections and internal tides. The OGCM used the present study has a horizontal resolution of about 15 m, and is driven by climatological atmospheric forcings (10-day interval) and hourly averaged outputs of a numerical simulation of the North Pacific with CORE2 normal-year atmospheric forcings with tides. In the present study, it will be discussed how the water circulation in the bay changes through a year, especially how seasonal variation of the vertical stratification affects Oyashio Water intrusion into the bay through internal tides.",

            "abstract": "Pulsating aurora is a typical phenomenon of the recovery phase of magnetic substorm and is frequently observed in the morning sector. The widely accepted generation mechanism of pulsations in precipitating electrons is related to wave-particle interactions around the equatorial plane in the magnetospheric tail. This mechanism is completely different from the discrete-arc case, which generates high-energy auroral electrons by the inverted-V type potential structure in the magnetospheric acceleration region. This potential structure induces the perpendicular electric field. The electric field is mapped down to the ionosphere, and enhances the Pedersen current as the ionospheric closure current. Since the perpendicular electric field directly relates to the Joule heating rate and the Lorentz force, thermal and kinetic energies in the thermosphere are locally increased in the vicinity of the arc rather than the inside, resulting in wind variations in the thermosphere. However, this scenario cannot be simply applied to the pulsating-auroral case because of the completely different mechanism of the auroral-electron generation, and we have believed that large energies are not dissipated in the pulsating aurora and there should be no obvious wind variations in the thermosphere. However, we found thermospheric-wind variations in the pulsating aurora during simultaneous observations with a Fabry-Perot Interferometer (557.7 nm), several cameras, and incoherent-scatter radars. This is a significantly important finding in evaluating our understanding of the energy budget in the substorm recovery phase. As mentioned above, the Joule heating process and the Lorentz force play important roles for thermospheric-wind variations. While the both cases need enhancements of the perpendicular electric field, we well know that a typical level of the convection electric field is too low to generate the wind variations in a same level as the observed in the pulsating aurora. Thus the observed wind variation is a clear evidence that our estimation of the dissipated energy in the recovery phase has been underestimated. This presentation will summarize our measurements showing several events of the pulsating aurora, in particular focusing on the energy budget in the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere coupled system.",

            "abstract": "Accurate measurements of soil greenhouse gas fluxes are critical for determining the role of ecosystem dynamics, both natural and managed, in climate change. We compared concentration profile methods with static, forced diffusion, and automated flux chambers using a combination of infrared gas analyzers (IRGA), gas chromatography, and cavity ring-down laser absorption spectroscopy (Picarro G2508) during field campaigns in managed ecosystems in California. At a drained peatland pasture site, we observed large differences between methods (fluxes ranged between 2-15 µmol CO2 m-2 s-1). However, low temporal/high spatial replication measurements (manual LI6400 chamber measurements; n=6 collars) encompassed the full range of CO2 fluxes observed across all other methods. This suggests that the majority of variability in CO2 emissions was due to high spatial variation in soil respiration and not due to methodological differences across measurement systems. At a dry upland pasture site, water, nitrate solution and manure were applied during the experimental period to expand the range of greenhouse fluxes. Preliminary results showed good agreement of gas fluxes between static and automatic chamber sampling. We observed large CO2 and N2O fluxes after manure application with both methods. The two chamber types were highly significantly correlated for N2O (slope=0.74, r2=0.94). Mean CH4 fluxes measured by static chambers was -0.36 µg cm-2 h-1, similar to the -0.57 µg cm-2 h-1 measured by the automatic chamber and Picarro analyzer during the study period. Overall, our results suggest that both automated and static chamber methods are in good agreement, but automated chambers are advantageous for capturing diel dynamics and pulse responses to experimental treatments. Our results also highlight the importance of spatial replication, which can be difficult to achieve using expensive automated chambers. We suggest future research efforts to seek a combination of high spatially replicated manual static chambers and continuous sampling methods.",

Harzburgites, various gabbroic cumulates, medium to fine-grained oxide gabbros, diabases and pillow basalts are recovered from segment ends such as ridge-transform intersections (RTI), non-transform discontinuities (NTD) and transform offset areas by dredging. The occurrence of both harzburgites and gabbroic rocks with minor basalts at all segments ends, and leucogabbro intrusive into harzburgite at the 12°45’S NTD appear to indicate that oceanic crust at segment ends consist of mantle-derived harzburgites and gabbroic intrusions with a thin basaltic cover due to sparse magmatic activity. Basalts collected from the whole ridge area show wide compositional variations between N (normal)- and E (enriched)-MORB. T (transitional)-MORB with enriched affinities are more prominent than N-MORBs. There is no tendency of enrichment towards specific direction. (La/Sm)N variations in MORB along the CIR (8°-21°S) fluctuates at a regional scale with local high positive anomalies which may reflect compositional heterogeneity of the sub-CIR mantle domain.",

            "abstract": "Acoustic waves from volcanic eruptions are often observed as infrasound in near fields. Part of them propagate upward and disturb the ionosphere, and can be observed in Total Electron Content (TEC) data derived by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers. In the past, Heki (2006 GRL) detected ionospheric disturbances by the 2004 explosion of the Asama Volcano, central Japan, and Dautermann et al. (2009 JGR) studied the 2003 eruption of the Soufriere Hills volcano in Montserrat, West Indies. Here we present new examples, and try to characterize such disturbances.\nWe first show TEC disturbances by the 2014 February Plinian eruption (VEI 4) of the Kelud volcano, East Java, Indonesia (Figure), observed with a regional GNSS network.The 2014 Kelud eruption broke a lava dome made by 2007 eruption and created a new creator. Significant disturbances were detected with four GPS and two GLONASS satellites, and the wavelet analyses showed that harmonic oscillations started at ~16:25 UT and continued nearly one hour. The frequency of the oscillation was ~3.8 mHz, which coincides with the atmospheric fundamental mode. We also confirmed concentric wavefronts, moving outward by ~0.8m/sec (stronger signals on the northern side). These features are similar to the 2003 Soufriere Hills case, although the signals in the present Kelud case is much clearer.\nNext, we compare them with ionospheric disturbances by Vulcanian explosions that occurred recently in Japan, i.e. the 2004 Asama case and the 2009 Sakurajima, and the 2011 Shin-moedake eruptions. They are characterized with one-time N-shaped disturbances possibly excited by the compression of the air above the vents. On the other hand, data from nearby seismometers suggested that atmospheric oscillations of various frequencies were excited by this continuous Plinian eruption. Part of such oscillations would have grown large due to atmospheric resonance.",

            "abstract": "Fresh water is essential to New Zealand’s economic, environmental, cultural and social well-being. In line with global trends, New Zealand’s freshwater resources are under pressure from increased abstraction and changes in land-use which contribute contaminants to our freshwater systems. Recent central government policy reform introduces greater national direction and guidance, to bring about a step-change in freshwater management. An existing national policy for freshwater management introduced in 2011 requires regional authorities to produce freshwater management plans containing clear freshwater objectives (measurable statements about the desired environmental state for water bodies) and associated limits to resource use (such as environmental flows and quantity allocation limits, and loads of contaminants to be discharged). These plans must integrate water quantity and quality management, consider climate change, and incorporate tangata whenua (New Zealand māori) roles and interests. In recent (2014) national policy amendments, the regional authorities are also required to implement national ‘bottom-line’ standards for certain attributes of the system to be managed; undertake accounting for all water takes and all sources of contaminants; and to develop and implement their plans in a collaborative way with communities. This rapid change in national policy has necessitated a new way of working for authorities tasked with implementation; many obstacles lie in their path. The scientific methods required to help set water quantity limits are well established, but water quality methods are less so. Collaborative processes have well documented benefits but also raise many challenges, particularly for the communication of complex and often uncertain scientific information. This paper provides background on the national policy changes and offers some early lessons learned by the regional authorities implementing collaborative freshwater management in New Zealand.",

            "abstract": "The degradation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) results in the formation of ozone (O3) and secondary organic aerosols (SOA) in the troposphere. This process consists of the oxidation of VOCs by hydroxyl radical (OH), O3, and nitrate radical (NO3). Detailed understanding of the VOC degradation mechanism is challenged by the co-existence of vast variety of VOC species in the atmosphere. However, investigations on ubiquitous oxidation intermediates, e.g., formaldehyde (HCHO) and glyoxal (CHOCHO), can help us improve the current knowledge of the VOC sources and degradation pathways. We installed one ground-based Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) system in Meteorological Research Institute (MRI) located at Tsukuba, Japan (36.06N, 130.13E) in June 2010. In addition, two more systems were installed in Chiba University at Chiba, Japan (35.63N, 140.10E) in June and December 2012, respectively. Since then, we have retrieved lower-tropospheric vertical profile information for eight components; aerosol extinction coefficients at two wavelengths, 357 and 476 nm, and NO2, HCHO, CHOCHO, H2O, SO2, and O3 concentrations. For a detailed evaluation for the aerosol retrieval, which is a key step in the MAX-DOAS eight-component retrieval, simultaneous aerosol observations with the Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS), lidar, and sky radiometer were conducted at Tsukuba on October 5-18, 2010. At Chiba, in addition to the comparison with sky radiometer data, a self-consistency test was performed by comparing results obtained from two MAX-DOAS systems operated at the same place. Through these detailed evaluations, our retrieval method was improved significantly, attaining excellent agreement with CRDS, lidar, and sky radiometer data. On the basis of these efforts, we find clear seasonal and diurnal temporal variations in HCHO and CHOCHO concentrations and their ratios (RGF) retrieved from MAX-DOAS systems. Using NO2 retrieved together with HCHO and CHOCHO, we find that HCHO and CHOCHO concentrations increased and the RGF decreased due to anthropogenic activities.",

The predicted average recurrence interval (ARI) for this event in the upper catchment was ~ 2000 yrs based on relatively short gauging station records (median 38 yrs in Eastern Australia). This study presents an assessment of the basin-scale (3000km2) spatial patterns of floodplain erosion, deposition, and net morphological change following the January 2011 using multitemporal Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) DEMs. Clear spatial patterns of floodplain deposition and erosion are evident reflecting high degrees of variability in channel capacity and floodplain inundation frequency. This data is then compared to a millennial-scale record of floodplain deposition from six key reaches of the Lockyer Valley determined using extensive stratigraphic and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating. OSL samples were taken from both bedrock and alluvial reaches and from both floodplain and within-channel benches. This presentation discusses the resultant spatial and temporal dynamics of floodplain deposition in a catchment dominated by hydrological extremes. The results highlight some important considerations of preservation potential in floodplain reconstruction but also provide data to test key hypotheses with respect to flood reconstruction in south eastern Australia.",

Recently, a low seismicity is also observed in 2012. There are nine months within 2012 with monthly seismicity rates low than the one standard deviation. It is worth to check that this is a seismic quiescence period before a big earthquake or other reasons. The first we checked the seismic network condition. We found some new seismic stations including the Broadband Array in Taiwan for Seismology (BATS) were incorporated within the Central Weather Bureau Seismic Network (CWBSN) since 2012. Most of those stations are located on hard rock sites which may affect the magnitude estimation. In order to reduce the impact of site effect, we collected the earthquake catalog data during the period from 1994 to 2012 to calculate the station correction for each station. There is a strong correlation between station corrections determined in this study and geological settings. Stations located on soil sites have high amplifications with negative station corrections. On the other hand, stations located on hard rock sites have low amplifications with positive station corrections. After applied the station corrections to revise ML estimation, seismicity rate obviously increases in 2012 and without low seismicity anomaly. Therefore, the reason low seismicity in 2012 is that new adding seismic stations which are installed on rock sites and lead to underestimate of the magnitude determination.",

            "abstract": "It is widely accepted that terrestrial ecosystem carbon dynamics are strongly coupled and controlled by soil nutrients status. Nutrient availability serves as an indicator of aboveground carbon productivity and ecosystem stability, especially when soils are infertile. In these conditions, plants have to outcompete microorganism and mineral surfaces to acquire nutrients required for photosynthesis, respiration, seed production, defense, etc. It is usually hypothesized that microbes are short-term winners but long-term losers in nutrient competition. Microbes quickly trap available soil nitrogen and phosphorous, thereby preventing nutrient inaccessibility through hydrological leaching and mineral surface adsorption. Over longer temporal scales, nutrients are released into the soil and become available for plant uptake.\nDespite its ecological significance, nutrient competition is either absent or over-simplified (e.g., assuming all consumers are equally competitive) in terrestrial biogeochemistry models. Here, we aim to test the representation of different competitive strategies and to investigate their ecological consequences with a newly developed biogeochemical model structure. The new model includes three major soil nutrients (ammonia, nitrate, and phosphate) and multiple consumers (plants, microbes, mineral surfaces, nitrifiers, and denitrifiers). We analyze predicted soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus dynamics with three different competitive strategies: (1) plants compete poorly against microorganisms; (2) all consumers are equally competitive; and (3) an explicit Equilibrium Chemical Approximation (ECA; Tang and Riley (2013)) treatment.\nWe find that very different ecosystem states are predicted when assuming different competitive structures, and that the ECA approach provides the best match with a large suite of observational constraints from tropical experimental and transect studies. We conclude that terrestrial biogeochemical models should represent a competitive structure that includes dynamic individual component representation of (1) nutrient stoichiometries; (2) affinities for nitrogen and phosphorous; and (3) abiotic interactions.",

            "abstract": "Biochar’s effects on improving soil fertility, enhancing crop productivity and reducing greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission from croplands had been well addressed in numerous short-term experiments with biochar soil amendment (BSA) mostly in a single crop season / cropping year. However, the persistence of these effects, after a single biochar application, has not yet been well known due to limited long-term field studies so far. Large scale BSA in agriculture is often commented on the high cost due to large amount of biochar in a single application. Here, we try to show the persistence of biochar effects on soil fertility and crop productivity improvement as well as GHGs emission reduction, using data from a field experiment with BSA for 5 crop seasons in central North China. A single amendment of biochar was performed at rates of 0 (C0), 20 (C20) and 40 t ha-1 (C40) before sowing of the first crop season. Emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O were monitored with static closed chamber method throughout the crop growing season for the 1st, 2nd and 5th cropping. Crop yield was measured and topsoil samples were collected at harvest of each crop season. BSA altered most of the soil physic-chemical properties with a significant increase over control in soil organic carbon (SOC) and available potassium (K) content. The increase in SOC and available K was consistent over the 5 crop seasons after BSA. Despite a significant yield increase in the first maize season, enhancement of crop yield was not consistent over crop seasons without corresponding to the changes in soil nutrient availability. BSA did not change seasonal total CO2 efflux but greatly reduced N2O emissions throughout the five seasons. This supported a stable nature of biochar carbon in soil, which played a consistent role in reducing N2O emission, which showed inter-annual variation with changes in temperature and soil moisture conditions. The biochar effect was much more consistent under C40 than under C20 and with GHGs emission than with soil property and crop yield. Thus, our study suggested that biochar amended in dry land could sustain a low carbon production both of maize and wheat in terms of its efficient carbon sequestration, lower GHGs emission intensity and soil improvement over 5 crop seasons after a single amendment.",

Especially, to understand solar activity effects, they were divided into solar maximum period and solar minimum period. As a result, more than 100 magnetic storms were examined with the magnetic storm size. Storms are divided into three categories in terms of the minimum value of the Dst index, Dstmin: severe(Dstmin<-200 nT), intense(-200 nT ≤Dstmin <-100 nT), moderate(-100 nT≤Dstmin<-50 nT). Regardless of storm size and the degree of solar activity, the average value of SMR-18 is among the highest and that of SMR-06 is lowest during magnetic storms. The correlation coefficient between the average value of SMR and that of SMR-18 was also higher than that of SMR versus SMR-06. This results means that the intensity of partial ring current in developing the ring current is stronger in the dusk sector than in dawn sector. For the severe storms, unusually, there is no difference between the average value of SMR-18 and that of SMR-00. Though the number of severe storm is a few in this study, it may mean the currents related to SMR-00 also have an important role in developing severe magnetic storms. Thus, the effect of SMR-18 in developing storm-time ring current decreases as the storm size increases. During recovery phase of magnetic storms, the shape of ring current is nearly symmetric. To compare the appearance of magnetic storms during recovery phase, SuperMAG-based indices and official auroral electrojets indices were compared. And, the SuperMAG-based indices and PC indices were also compared during magnetic storm period.",

We explore changes in flood frequency in the Pacific Northwest using downscaled output from ten Global Climate Models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Inter-Comparison Project 5 (CMIP5) for historical forcings (1950-2005) and future Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 (2006-2100). We use archived output from the Integrated Scenarios Project (ISP) (http://maca.northwestknowledge.net/), which uses the Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) method for statistical downscaling. The MACA-downscaled GCM output was then used to force the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrology model with a 1/16th degree spatial resolution and a daily time step. For each of the 238 HUC-08 areas within the Pacific Northwest (USGS Hydrologic Region 15), we computed, from the ISP archive, the series of maximum daily runoff values (surrogate for the annual maximum flood), and then the mean annual flood. Finally, we computed the ratios of the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 mean annual floods to their corresponding values for the historical period. We evaluate spatial patterns in the results. For snow-dominated watersheds, the changes are dominated by reductions in flood frequency in basins that currently have spring-dominant floods, and increases in snow affected basins with fall-dominant floods. In low elevation basins west of the Cascades, changes in flooding are more directly related to changes in precipitation extremes. We further explore the nature of these effects by evaluating the mean Julian day of the annual maximum flood for each HUC-08 and how this changes between the historical and RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Structural uncertainty is an aspect of uncertainty quantification that is receiving increasing attention due to its zero-th order impact in forecasting flow in subsurface formations. Imperfect data and lack of geological understanding poses both challenges of conceptual uncertainty at the fault hierarchy level and parameter uncertainty at single fault level. Therefore structural uncertainty is often underrepresented in subsurface modeling. Unlike property uncertainty, such as for hydraulic conductivity & porosity few methods to address structural uncertainty in an integrated manner exist. A first bottleneck with modeling structural uncertainty is due to constraints posed by fault hierarchy, fault-horizon consistency, and structural-depositional environment consistency. A second bottleneck associated with structural uncertainty lies in the difficulty to construct grids compatible for flow & transport simulations, often requiring manual intervention. In this presentation, we propose to use approximate geological representations of faults in a simple Cartesian domain and to select appropriate structural models using flow proxies in the same Cartesian domain . Faults are first mapped into a Cartesian (depositional) space using an unfolding-unfaulting operation. Fault uncertainty is then modeled implicitly by increasing or decreasing the size of fault blocks in depositional space or by simple removing fault without affecting hierarchical/age relationships. Utilizing simple flow diagnostics in the Cartesian domain we select a small amount (10s) of structural models to represent flow & transport uncertainty. A case study illustrates how this approximate method compares well with the full method of modeling 100s of structural models.",

This earthquake, called Cinchona earthquake, caused many landslides and around 20 fatalities. Alvarado (2009) reported that the area of landslides was concentrated in the northwestern part of the epicenter. To simulate the relationships between the location of landslides and acceleration, we detected landslides and coseismic deformation by using the ALOS/PALSAR radar image analyses. We first detected the coseismic deformation for ascending and descending tracks by InSAR analysis. The maximum coseismic Line of Sight (LOS) changes were around 20cm for both tracks. We derived the fault source model to explain the LOS changes, using elastic dislocation sources; the optimum geometry was inferred by trial-and-errors. The location of the fault model indicated that the source fault of this earthquake was the northern part of the Angel fault. We also detected the signal of landslides by pixel-offset techniques. The signal had larger amplitude in narrower area than coseismic deformation. The signal was placed on the same area reported by Alvarado (2009). As following the attenuation relationships for peak ground acceleration (Si and Midorikawa, 1999), we calculated the horizontal peak ground acceleration. The signal of landslides was concentrated in the area where the value of peak ground acceleration had larger than 450 gal.",

            "abstract": "The needs to consider the NEXUS on food and water were emphasized in international dialogues and publications around the end of the 20th century. In fact, in 1983, the United Nations University already launched a Food-Energy Nexus Programme to fill the gaps between the issues of food and energy. The term “NEXUS” to link water, food, and trade was also used in the World Bank during 1990s. The idea of NEXUS is likely to have further developed under the discussion of “virtual water” and “water footprints”. With experiencing several international discussions such as Kyoto World Water Forum 2003, scholars and practitioners around the globe acknowledged the need to include energy for the pillars of NEXUS. Finally, the importance of three NEXUS pillars, “water, energy, and food” was officially announced in the BONN 2011 NEXUS Conference, which is a turning point of NEXUS idea in the international community , in order to contribute to the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) in 2012 that highlighted the concept of “green economy”.\nThe concept of NEXUS is becoming a requisite to achieve sustainable development due to the global concerns embedded in society, economy, and environment. The concept stresses to promote the cooperation with the sectors such as water, energy, food, and climate change since these complex global issues are dependent and inter-connected, which can no longer be solved by the sectorial approaches. The NEXUS practices are currently shared among different stakeholders through various modes including literatures, conferences, workshops, and research projects. However, since the NEXUS practices are not led by a particular organization, its concept, theory, policy, tools, methods, and applications are diverse and incoherent. In terms of tools/methods, the potential of integrated modeling approach is introduced to avoid pressures and to promote interactions among water, energy and food.\nThis paper explores the concepts, tools/methods, and practices of water-energy-food NEXUS to evaluate human environmental security under the RIHN project on “Human-Environmental Security in the Asia-Pacific Ring of Fire: Water-Energy-Food Nexus”.",

            "abstract": "The oceanic iron cycle is estimated by optimizing a simple steady-state model based on a data-assimilated global circulation, with a prescribed optimized phosphorus cycle and a prescribed aeolian source pattern. Key biogeochemical parameters are determined by minimizing a suitably weighted quadratic misfit between the model’s dissolved iron concentration and a global data set of sparse measurements. The global dissolved iron inventory is estimated to be (7.1±0.1)×1011 mol Fe, of which (6.9±0.1)×1011 mol Fe is bound to organic ligands and hence bioavailable, while the remainder is “free” iron. The aeolian iron input rate is estimated at (3.3±0.5)×109 mol Fe/year, corresponding to a bulk residence time for bioavailable iron of 215±40 years, comparable to the bulk biological cycling timescale estimated at 246±24 years. Iron limitation is quantified in terms of the difference [Fe∗] between the actual iron concentration and that needed to utilize the available phosphate. The optimized model captures the observed high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll regions of the ocean as iron-limited regions with [Fe∗]<0. We define an iron age, ΓFe, as the mean time since iron at a given point was last injected from the atmosphere and compute ΓFe using an equivalent linear formulation of the model. In the euphotic zone, ΓFe ranges from a few decades or less in regions of high aeolian input to ∼1800 years in the Southern Ocean. The patterns of ΓFe show that iron is supplied to the Southern Ocean euphotic zone primarily from depth rather than being advected within the thermocline following deposition from continental dust plumes. Because [Fe∗] is negative in the deep southern oceans, upwelling waters maintain Southern Ocean iron limitation.",

We have investigated the changes in these average properties with varying solar wind conditions and magnetospheric activity. The time-averaged thickness of the current sheet was obtained from superposed epoch analysis (SEA) of the 1-s-averaged vector magnetic field data within ± 10 min of the identified magnetic equator position at different down-tail distances. The average thickness was then estimated from a given SEA by identifying the time interval during which the field completed a rotation from the sunward to the anti-sunward direction, or vice versa, accompanied by a depression in the field magnitude. We have found that the current sheet has a thickness of ~0.8 RM (where RM is Mercury’s radius, or 2440 km) close to the planet (~ 1.1 RM) and thins to ~0.2 RM in the far tail region (~2.8 RM). We examined individual orbits to catalogue the existence and number of current sheet crossings encountered on each orbit. These data allow us to (1) determine whether the thickness obtained from the SEA is an actual thickness or an apparent thickness controlled by rapid motions of the current sheet, and (2) estimate the statistical likelihood of observing the current sheet as a function of down-tail distance. For example, some magnetically quiet orbits that cross the magnetic equator at down-tail distances greater than 2 RM do not record a current sheet crossing and appear to cross closed field lines in the vicinity of the magnetic equator, even though they lie in a region in which the tail current sheet is usually observed. This result suggests that the inner (near-planet) edge of the current sheet is not stationary but may move anti-sunward (or sunward) under quiet (or active) magnetospheric conditions.",

All fluid discharges are cold except for two hot springs in the central and N segments and another 6 on the W margin of the HAP. The total flow rate along the HAP is at least 10 x 108L/a, with nearly 50% contributed by cold discharges.\nMost fluid manifestations emerge along NE-trending faults and minor structures such as anticlines and synclines. However in the N, where fluids are also discharged along NW- and EW-trending structures within the allochton, manifestations are relatively more abundant (>150 sites), discharging nearly 45% of the annual surface fluid volume along the HAP.\nFluid discharges in the HAP, based on chemical and isotopic fluid compositions, consist of subducted waters derived from clay water of hydration (<50%) and seawater that had interacted at varying degrees with organic-containing sedimentary rocks at depth at different temperatures. Discharges from the central segment exhibit the lowest degree of water-rock interaction and have the highest inferred subsurface temperatures (median: 110oC compared to S at 80oC and N at 90oC), suggesting (1) more recent influx of subducted waters and (2) more rapid upflow of fluids from depth, relative to the S and N. Fluids in the S segment exhibit the highest degree of water-rock interaction suggesting longer residence time at depth, or slower fluid movement to the surface due to thicker crust or greater fluid channel tortuosity. The high concentration of isotopic He in the central and N fluids can be due to deep and highly permeable faults that channel mantle gases and also allow waters to rise very rapidly from as deep as the fracture zone between the overriding and down going plates. Fluid compositions indicate that the youngest fluids are rapidly expelled in the central and N segments although the latter is complicated by the presence of inherited allochton fluids.",

The EMIC waves occur at the H+ band with the intensity up to ~102 nT2/Hz, and the proton fluxes rapidly increase by 3~6 times with the strong pitch-angle anisotropy. Using the linear theory, we calculated the temperature anisotropy, the instability parameter and the EMIC growth parameter for this event base on the observational data.

It is an all-in-one plasma sensor with the sampling rate up to 8,192 Hz to measure ionospheric plasma concentrations, velocities, and temperatures over a wide range of spatial scales. The design of AIP sensor allows it to sequentially perform as a Retarding Potential Analyzer (RPA), an Ion Drift Meter (IDM), an Ion Trap (IT), or a Planer Langmuir Probe (PLP). Unlike the inherited payload IPEI onboard FORMOSAT-1/ROCSAT-1, the entrance opening of IDM of AIP is circular instead of square shape, causes the difference in the geometry calculation of the projection area. New method is present to obtain the incident angle from the incoming plasma beam. Meanwhile, a set of sweeping voltage pattern is defined to get a better result of plasma parameters from RPA function. Upon the requirement of the mission, several sweeping voltage patterns are designed to fit the specified species of plasma to increase the accuracy in the derivation of ram speed and temperature. A simulation is present to show the fitting result in different assumptions and conditions for each sweeping pattern.",

            "abstract": "Episodic tremor and slow slip (ETS) events have been detected along the Cascadia margin, as well as many other subduction zones, by increasingly dense seismic and geodetic networks over the past decade. In northern Cascadia, ETS events arise on the thrust fault interface of 30~50 km depth, coincident with metamorphic dehydration of the subducting oceanic slab around temperatures of 350. Previous numerical simulations (e.g., Liu and Rice 2007) suggested that near-lithostatic pore pressure in the rate-state friction stability transition zone could give rise to slow slip events (SSE) down-dip of the seismogenic zone, which provides a plausible physical mechanism for these phenomena.\nHere we present a 3-D numerical simulation of inter-seismic SSEs based on the rate- and state- friction law, incorporating a non-planar, realistic northern Cascadia slab geometry compiled by McCrory et al. (2012) using triangular dislocation elements. Preliminary results show that the width and pore pressure level of the transition zone can remarkably affect the recurrence of SSEs. With effective normal stress of ~1-2 MPa and characteristic slip distance of ~1.4 mm, inter-seismic SSEs can arise about every year. The duration of each event is about 2~3 weeks, with the propagating speed along strike in the range of km/day. Furthermore, the slab bending beneath southern Vancouver Island and northern Washington State appears to accelerate the along-strike propagation of SSEs. Our next step is to constrain the rate-state frictional properties using geodetic inversion of SSE slip and inter-SSE plate coupling from the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) GPS measurements. Incorporating the realistic fault geometry into a physics model constrained by geodetic data will enable us to transition from a conceptual towards a quantitative and predictive understanding of SSEs mechanism.",

About 14-22% of aerosol particles during the campaign are of externally mixed CCN-inactive particles that cannot serve as CCN under atmospheric typical supersaturation (SS) of ~0.4%. A high sensitivity of Maximum activation fractions (MAF) to SS under polluted conditions has been observed. The pollutants can cause a maximum MAF decrease of 25%-30% (at SS=0.08%). Hygroscopicity parameter kappa (κ) are about 16%-35% lower under polluted conditions than under clean conditions for particles in accumulation size range (80-180 nm); however, for particles in nucleation or Aitken size range (30-60 nm), κ is slightly higher under polluted conditions. A non-parallel observation (NPO) CCN closure study shows low correlation coefficient between estimated and observed CCN number concentrations (NCCN). About 30%-40% uncertainties in NCCN prediction are associated with the changes of particle composition. A case study shows that CCN activation ratio (AR) increased with the increase of condensation nuclei (CN) number concentrations (NCN) in relatively clean days. In the case, AR exhibited good correlation with κchem, which is calculated from chemical volume fractions, due to particles mainly composed of soluble inorganics. On the contrary, AR declined with increase of NCN during polluted events when particles composed mostly of organics. Meanwhile, AR is closely related to f44, which is the fraction of total organic mass signal at m/z 44 and closely associated with particle organic oxidation level. Our study highlights the importance of aerosols chemical composition on determining the activation properties of aerosol particles, underlining the importance of long-term observation of CCN under different atmospheric environments, especially those with heavy pollution and high CN number concentrations.",

Typically these unusual sites are found in light-toned outcrops or interior layered deposits associated with phyllosilicates, sulfates or both. Frequently these units are called “doublet” materials because they exhibit a doublet absorption in CRISM spectra between 2.2 and 2.3 µm. We are investigating the spectral signatures of these martian materials compared to our library of minerals and alteration materials. We are also evaluating the stratigraphy of these unique alteration phases compared with neighboring phyllosilicate and sulfate units.\nA similar 2.2-2.3 µm doublet has been observed in spectra taken of acid altered clays produced in the laboratory (Madejova et al., 2009; Tosca et al., 2009). The band centers and relative intensities of these martian doublet features vary greatly suggesting that a process such as acid weathering could be acting on OH-bearing minerals to produce altered phases that differ depending on the type of substrate, water/rock ratio, solution chemistry, and duration of aqueous processes.\nBecause these unique materials occur in many regions across a range of times on Mars, acidic alteration may have been a key process at local and regional scales throughout martian geologic history. Constraining the types of acidic alteration that have taken place on Mars will assist in defining the aqueous geochemistry at these sites and whether habitable conditions were possible.\n",

            "abstract": "The diverse range of data for the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake are unprecedented. However, several models using joint data sets still disagree on the estimated slip distribution due to (1) choice of fault geometry and elastic structure; (2) choice of regularization scheme in optimization approaches; (3) lack or under-estimation of model prediction error due to imperfect forward modeling. Some important questions therefore remain unresolved, e.g., what is the profile of fault slip as one approaches the trench, and how much of the co-seismic signals is recorded in seafloor geodetic measurements.\nTo obtain robust and detailed features of the co-seismic process, we present an approach to invert for the seafloor deformation field using only tsunami waveforms recorded by near-field stations, including GPS buoys, ocean bottom pressure gauges, cable pressure gauges and open ocean DART buoys. In addition to observational error, we incorporate model prediction error by considering the uncertainty in dispersion characteristics of tsunami propagation simulations. We adopt an analytical Bayesian approach to derive the posterior distributions for the coseismic seafloor deformation with minimal a priori assumptions. The analytical approach provides fast and robust characterization of coseismic seafloor deformation using the first arrivals of tsunami waveforms with potential for real-time applications.\nOur models show that large seafloor uplift is required at the trench, with maximum seafloor uplift occurring about 50 km from the trench. The actual fault slip depends on the assumed elastic structure and fault geometry; in the case of a homogeneous half-space and simplified fault geometry, slip decreases towards the trench. This method also provides direct comparisons with seafloor geodetic measurements and a quantitative estimation of the respective contributions from co- and post-seismic processes.",

Shales, which consist of mainly clay minerals, are potential caprocks for the CO2 storage reservoirs. The properties of clay minerals in shales may affect the sealing capacity of shales. In this study, changes in clay minerals’ properties when contacted with supercritical (SC) CO2 at various conditions were investigated. Bentonite, whichis composed of primarily montmorillonite, was used as the clay material in this study. Batch reactor tests on wet bentonite samples in the presence of SC CO2 with or without aqueous phases were conducted at high pressure (12 MPa) and moderate temperature (50 oC) conditions for a week. Results show that the bentonite samples obtained from the tests with SC CO2 had less change in porosity than those obtained from the tests without SC CO2 (vacuum-drying) at a given reaction time, indicating that the bentonite samples dried in the presence of SC CO2 maintained their structure. These results suggest that CO2 molecules can diffuse into interlayer of montmorillonite, which is a primary mineral of bentonite, and form a single CO2 molecule layer or double CO2 molecule layers. The CO2 molecules can displace water molecules in the interlayer, resulting in maintaining the interlayer spacing when dehydration occurs. Noticeable changes in reacted bentonite samples obtained from the tests with an aqueous phase (NaCl, CaCl2, or sea water) are decreases in the fraction of plagioclase and pyrite and formation of carbonate minerals (i.e., calcite and dolomite) and halite. In addition, no significant exchanges of Na or Ca on the exchangeable complex of the montmorillonite in the presence of SC CO2 occurred, resulting in no significant changes in the swelling capacity of bentonite samples after reacting with SC CO2 in the presence of aqueous phases. These results might be attributed by the CO2 molecule layer, which prevents diffusion of ions into the interlayer.",

            "abstract": "The efficiency of thermal pressurisation as a dynamic weakening mechanism during earthquake slip relies on the thermal and hydraulic properties of the rocks surrounding the slip zone. A common approach to test the effect of thermal pressurisation is to make theoretical predictions using fault rock properties (permeability, porosity, compressibility) measured on exhumed fault rock samples. However, it is generally not possible to test whether those predictions are valid. Here, we attempt to assess the effectiveness of thermal pressurisation by comparing theoretical predictions of temperature rise to field estimates based on pseudotachylytes-bearing rocks. We measure hydraulic and transport properties of a suite of fault rocks (a healed fracture damage zone, an unhealed fracture damage zone and the intact parent rock) from the pseudotachylyte-bearing Gole Larghe fault in the Adamello batholith (Italy), and use them as inputs in realistic numerical simulations of thermal pressurisation. We find that the melting temperature can be reached only if damaged, unhealed rock properties are used, and not with the intact or the healed fault rock properties. A 10 fold increase in permeability, or a 4 fold increase in pore compressiblity of the intact rock is required to achieve melting. Our results emphasise the existence of dynamic damage processes which strongly modify fault rocks properties during earthquake propagation, and indirectly affect earthquake propagation itself by decreasing the efficiency of thermal pressurisation as a weakening mechanism.",

The model domain included whole of the JS with 4 shallow straits and its resolution was 1/12 degree. Numerical integrations were performed from 2006 to 2100 using atmospheric conditions from the results of the CGCM3 global climate model under the IPCC-AR5 rcp4.5 scenario. We used monthly climatological volume transport of the TWC through the Tsushima strait based on observations as inflow and outflow conditions at 4 open boundaries. Model result showed that large meanderings of the SPF intermittently occurred around 133oE (the western region) and and 137oE (the eastern region) . Inter annual variations of the eastward volume transport of the TWC were characterized between three periods: period 1) Large volume transport (about 6Sv) (from 2006 to 2030); period 2) decreasing of the volume transport from 6Sv to 4Sv (from 2030 to 2060); period 3) small volume transport accompanied by large decadal fluctuations (from 2060 to 2100). During period 1, the SPF continued to meander with large amplitudes in western and eastern region of the JS. The meanderings in period 2 were smaller than those in period 1, which resulted in straight path of the SPF. Large meanderings were sometimes found only in the western region, while small meanderings frequently occurred anywhere during period 3. These results suggest that the large meanderings of the SPF are induced by the large volume transport and small meanderings are caused by inter-annual fluctuation of the volume transport of TWC.",

            "abstract": "Characterizing sediment provenance from the geologic and geomorphic records left by natural disasters may shed light on the sedimentary and hydrodynamic processes happening during such events. In this study, we collected modern sediment samples from onshore, offshore, the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami and three palaeotsunamis and a 2007 storm deposit from Phra Thong Island, Thailand. To explore the relationship between the sedimentary deposits, we examined grainsize parameters, mineralogy (from X-Ray Diffraction) and trace element geochemistry (from X-Ray Fluorescence) from each deposit and applied a series of statistical analyses including cluster analysis, principal component analysis and discriminant function analysis.\nOur results show that the mineral content and grainsize parameters are statistically inadequate to distinguish the provenance of tsunami deposits, but that trace element geochemistry is potentially a good discriminator. In most of our statistical analyses, the trace elements show that the onshore samples are distinguished from the offshore and tsunami sediment samples. Also, the near-shore samples and tsunami deposits are very similar. This reveals that the near-shore marine sediments significantly contributed to the 2004 tsunami deposits. In addition, our analyses show that all four tsunami units statistically differ from each other, and that the storm deposits are similar to the second palaeo-tsunami group. This indicates that sediment sources are diverse and that the tsunami deposits did not come from the same source. Such complexity raises questions about the origin of various sedimentary environments and it also reflects the importance of local context and paleogeography that cannot be ignored in tsunami provenance studies.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric ammonia (NH3) plays an important role in fine particle formation. Accurate estimates of ammonia can reduce uncertainties in air quality modeling. China is one of the largest countries emitting ammonia with the majority of NH3 emissions coming from the agricultural practices, such as fertilizer applications and animal operations. The current ammonia emission estimates in China are mainly based on pre-defined emission factors. Thus, there are considerable uncertainties in estimating NH3 emissions, especially in time and space distribution. For example, fertilizer applications vary in the date of application and amount by geographical regions and crop types. In this study, the NH3 emission from the agricultural fertilizer use in China of 2011 was estimated online by an agricultural fertilizer modeling system coupling a regional air-quality model and an agro-ecosystem model, which contains three main components 1) the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model, 2) the meso-scale meteorology Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and 3) the CMAQ air quality model with bi-directional ammonia fluxes. The EPIC output information about daily fertilizer application and soil characteristics would be the input of the CMAQ model. In order to run EPIC model, much Chinese local information is collected and processed. For example, Crop land data are computed from the MODIS land use data at 500-m resolution and crop categories at Chinese county level; the fertilizer use rate for different fertilizer types, crops and provinces are obtained from Chinese statistic materials. The system takes into consideration many influencing factors on agriculture ammonia emission, including weather, the fertilizer application method, timing, amount, and rate for specific pastures and crops. The simulated fertilizer data is compared with the NH3 emissions and fertilizer application data from other sources. The results of CMAQ modeling are also discussed and analyzed with field measurements. The estimated agricultural fertilizer NH3 emission in this study is about 3Tg in 2011. The regions with the highest emission rates are located in the North China Plain. Monthly, the peak ammonia emissions occur in April to July.\n ",

            "abstract": "The largest glacier changes are primarily observed in settings where ice flows into a proglacial water body. However, the responses to this interaction are not uniform. Rapidly retreating glaciers can occur in close vicinity to advancing ones. Calving styles and glacier morphologies vary greatly as well. Temperate lake-calving glaciers frequently exhibit floating tongues; but this is rarely observed on temperate tidewater glaciers. Calving styles range from mostly sub-aerial calving to full-thickness calving to slow detachment of large ice bergs. \nIn addition to the more obvious mechanical calving, glaciers lose mass at their termini through sub-aqueous melting. Melt rates of submerged ice have been shown to vary over several orders of magnitudes, and can range up to several meters per day. This large range is a consequence of different proglacial water temperatures, and of different modes of water transport. Water convection in proglacial water bodies can be driven by winds and tides, but subglacial water discharge is commonly the strongest and most variable driver. Here we attempt to relate the variability of forcings and melt rates to the various morphologies and calving styles of different water-terminating glaciers. The highest melt rates are observed at low-latitude tidewater glaciers, where ocean water can be warm (7 – 10 deg C) and subglacial discharge high. In such settings, sub-aqueous melt can reach the same magnitude as ice flux delivered to the terminus and it can control ice terminus position. Polar tidewater glaciers, such as those in Greenland, often exhibit floating tongues. Although melt rates are likely much lower, they can have a large effect under a floating tongue because of the much larger exposure of ice to water. Changes in melt rates can therefore affect the stability of such floating tongues. Low melt rates occur at some ice shelves at high latitudes, where the temperature and freshwater forcings are small. This situation can also occur at temperate lake-calving glaciers, which often flow into lakes of near freezing temperatures. Due to the very small density differences between subglacial discharge and ambient lake water, convection below the floating tongue is minor or non-existent.. This is in great contrast to fresh water entering a saline environment.",

            "abstract": "Tectonic tremors and slow earthquakes, which are detected in many subduction zones and transform faults, are characterized by various quantities, such as duration, recurrence interval, and the sensitivity to tidal stress. These characteristic quantities are spatially variable among regions and even within an individual region. It is also known that the seismic energy release by tremor also spatially varies (e.g., Maeda and Obara, 2009; Ando et al., 2012; Yabe and Ide, in review). We interpret the spatial variation in seismic energy rate (amplitude) of tremors to represent the variation of plate-interface strength, in which case the spatial variation of tidal sensitivity might correlate with that of seismic energy rate. To investigate such relation, we have investigated the spatial variation of tidal sensitivity in Nankai and Cascadia subduction zones. Although the spatial variation of tidal sensitivity has been investigated using the frequency spectrum at specific tidal frequency, we calculate the time history of tidal stressing on the plate interface and compare it with tremor activity to investigate their relation.\nBoth body tide and ocean tide are included in the calculation of tidal stress. We calculated Green functions for the spherical Earth based on the method by Okubo and Tsuji (2001). The time history of sea surface level is calculated with the SPOTL program (Agnew, 2012). The fault planes of VLF estimated by Ide and Yabe (2014) are used to calculate stress on the plate interface.\nTremors are more likely to occur when tidal shear stress is larger, in the subduction direction. Tremor rate appears to increase exponentially with tidal shear stress, as previously seen by Houston (2013, AGU). Although tidal sensitivity can be seen in many regions, some regions show particularly strong sensitivity. In some regions, tidal sensitivity can be seen clearly during the later portions of large SSEs, consistent with behavior reported by Houston (2013, AGU), while other regions show tidal sensitivity without large SSEs as well. In the regions where tidal sensitivity can be seen, the rake direction of VLF is consistent with the direction of maximum tidal shear stress on that fault plane. This observation might imply that tidal stress significantly modulates the timing of slow slip on the deep plate interface.",

            "abstract": "Semi-volatile organic species (SVOC) can condense on suspended particulate materials (PM) in the atmosphere. The modeling of condensation/evaporation of SVOC often assumes that gas-phase and particle-phase concentrations are at equilibrium. However, recent studies show that secondary organic aerosols (SOA) may not be accurately represented by an equilibrium approach between the gas and particle phases, because organic aerosols in the particle phase may be very viscous. The condensation in the viscous liquid phase is limited by the diffusion from the surface of PM to its core. Using a surrogate approach to represent SVOC, depending on the user’s choice, the secondary organic aerosol processor (SOAP) may assume equilibrium or model dynamically the condensation/evaporation between the gas and particle phases to take into account the viscosity of organic aerosols. The model is implemented in the three-dimensional chemistry-transport model of POLYPHEMUS. In SOAP, activity coefficients for organic mixtures can be computed using UNIFAC for short-range interactions between molecules and AIOMFAC to also take into account the effect of inorganic species on activity coefficients. Simulations over Europe are performed and POLYPHEMUS/SOAP is compared to POLYPHEMUS/H2O, which was previously used to model SOA using the equilibrium approach with activity coefficients from UNIFAC. Impacts of the dynamic approach on modeling SOA over Europe are evaluated. The concentrations of SOA using the dynamic approach are compared with those using the equilibrium approach. The increase of computational cost is also evaluated.",

Our results show that the changes in mercury emission factors driven by vegetation change would significantly affect the mercury emissions from biomass burning over some regions, although little change in the global mercury emissions is calculated. Accounting for the changes in wildfire activities driven by land cover change by 2050 leads to an increase by 14% in the global total mercury emissions from biomass burning with even larger regional perturbations.",

            "abstract": "In this study, a strong negative correlation was found between East Indian Ocean (EIO) SST and frequency of summertime tropical cyclone (TC) affecting Korea.\nFor the Warm EIO SST years, the TCs mostly occurred in the southwestern region of tropical and subtropical western Pacific, and migrated west toward the southern coast of China and Indochinese peninsula through the South China Sea. This is because the anomalous easterlies, induced by the development of anomalous anticyclone (weakening of monsoon trough) from the tropical central Pacific to the southern coast of China, served as the steering flows for the westward migration of TCs. In contrast, for the cold EIO SST years, the TCs mostly occurred in the northeastern region of tropical and subtropical western Pacific, and migrated toward Korea and Japan located in the mid-latitudes of East Asia through the East China Sea. This is because the northeastward retreat of subtropical western North Pacific high (SWNPH) was more distinct for the cold EIO SST years compared to the warm EIO SST years. Therefore, the TCs of warm EIO SST years weakened or dissipated shortly due to the effect of geographical features as they land on the southern coast of China and Indochinese peninsula, whereas the TCs of cold EIO SST years had stronger intensity than the TCs of warm EIO SST years as sufficient energy is supplied from the ocean while moving toward Korea and Japan.",

            "abstract": "After almost 3.5 years of quiescence, Piton de la Fournaise (PdF) produced a small summit eruption on 20 June 2014 at 21:35 (GMT). The eruption lasted 20 hours and was preceded by:\ni) onset of deep eccentric seismicity (15-20 km bsl; 9 km NW of the volcano summit) in March and April 2014;\nii) enhanced CO2 soil flux along the NW rift zone;\niii) increase in the number and energy of shallow (<1.5 km asl) VT events.\nThe increase in VT events occurred on 9 June. Their signature, and shallow location, was not characteristic of an eruptive crisis. However, at 20:06 on 20/06 their character changed. This was 74 minutes before the onset of tremor. Deformations then began at 20:20.\nSince 2007, PdF has emitted small magma volumes (<3 Mm3) in events preceded by weak and short precursory phases. To respond to this challenging activity style, new monitoring methods were deployed at OVPF. While the JERK and MSNoise methods were developed for processing of seismic data, borehole tiltmeters and permanent monitoring of summit gas emissions, plus CO2 soil flux, were used to track precursory activity. JERK, based on an analysis of the acceleration slope of a broad-band seismometer data, allowed advanced notice of the new eruption by 50 minutes. MSNoise, based on seismic velocity determination, showed a significant decrease 7 days before the eruption. These signals were coupled with change in summit fumarole composition.\nRemote sensing allowed the following syn-eruptive observations:\n- INSAR confirmed measurements made by the OVPF geodetic network, showing that deformation was localized around the eruptive fissures;\n- A SPOT5 image acquired at 05:41 on 21/06 allowed definition of the flow field area (194 500 m2);\n- A MODIS image acquired at 06:35 on 21/06 gave a lava discharge rate of 6.9±2.8 m3 s-1, giving an erupted volume of 0.3 and 0.4 Mm3.\n- This rate was used with the DOWNFLOW and FLOWGO models, calibrated with the textural data from Piton’s 2010 lava, to run lava flow projections; showing that the event was volume limited.\nPreliminary sample analyses suggest that the olivine rich lavas have a differentiated character (melt MgO: 5.8 - 6.2 wt.%); proof of chamber residence. However, some aphyric tephra are more primitive (MgO: 8.2 wt.%). This suggests eruption due to injection of a small volume of new magma that destabilized an old magma pocket.",

            "abstract": "The dynamic nature of relativistic electrons in the magnetosphere is well known but the detailed causes are not, partially due to the lack of a system-wide observation that would provide physical constraints for comprehensive modeling efforts. The Van Allen Probes, which are in a low inclination (100) geo-transfer-like orbit, carry the state-of-art particle and field measurements. The Relativistic Electron and Proton Telescope (REPT) and the Magnetic Electron Ion Spectrometer (MagEIS) instruments aboard measure the full distribution of relativistic electrons as they traverse the heart of both inner and outer radiation belt. However, due to the small equatorial loss cone (only a few degrees at outer belt), it is difficult for REPT and MagEIS to directly determine which electrons will precipitate into the atmosphere and which ones will remain trapped in the outer radiation belt. The Relativistic Electron and Proton Telescope integrated little experiment (REPTile) onboard the Colorado Student Space Weather Experiment (CSSWE) CubeSat, which is in a highly inclined (650) low Earth orbit, measures only the fraction of the total population that have small enough equatorial pitch angles to reach the altitude of CSSWE, thus measuring the precipitating population as well as the trapped population. Finally, the THEMIS spacecraft, because of their higher apogees, provide critical information of the electron source populations, which can be at beyond Van Allen Probes’ apogees.\nIn this presentation, coordinated measurements of the relativistic electrons from multiple spacecraft will be presented and conclusions will be drawn based on the measurement and preliminary modeling, including the upper limit of the relativistic electron population in the inner belt.",

            "abstract": "In this presentation, a newly developed theory is applied to the case of stationary and non-stationary stochastic advective flow field, and a numerical solution method is presented for the resulting fractional Fokker-Planck equation (fFPE), which describes the evolution of the probability density function (PDF) of contaminant concentration. The derived fFPE is evaluated for three different form: 1) purely advective form, 2) second-order moment form and 3) second-order cumulant form. The Monte Carlo analysis of the fractional governing equation is then performed in a stochastic flow field, generated by a fractional Brownian motion for the stationary and non-stationary stochastic advection, in order to provide a benchmark for the results obtained from the fFPEs. When compared to the Monte Carlo simulation based PDFs and their ensemble average, the second-order cumulant form gives a good fit in terms of the shape and mode of the PDF of the contaminant concentration. Therefore, it is quite promising that the non-Fickian transport behavior can be modeled by the derived fractional ensemble average transport equations either by means of the long memory in the underlying stochastic flow, or by means of the time-space non-stationarity of the underlying stochastic flow, or by means of the time and space fractional derivatives of the transport equations.\n<Acknowledgement>\nThis subject is supported by Korea Ministry of Environment as “The Eco Innovation Project : Non-point source pollution control research group”",

Results demonstrated that the simulations in the BTH region support the redox mechanism at night and the heterogeneous photochemistry mechanism in the daytime for HONO formation, and suggested that the order of magnitude of γ is likely to be 10-4. Minor increases in HONO, HOx, O3, NO3-, and NH4+ were produced when γ was decreased to ≤ 10-5, whereas the concentrations of HONO and NO3- were substantially overestimated in most cases when γ was increased to 10-3. The soot surface area per unit volume of air showed a sharp decrease from 3×103 μm2 cm-3 near the ground to 6×102 μm2 cm-3 at ~200 m at night. The surface area fractions of soot, nitrate, and sulfate showed minor variations between day and night, although the surface areas of the major aerosol components at night were ~ three times those in the daytime.",

Their skeletal axes are used for jewellery, rosary, amulet, etc. They are found mainly in the Japanese coast, the Mediterranean and off the Midway Islands and they are distributed at a depth of 100 m to 1500m. The growing skeletons of precious corals have potential for recording environmental change. Pb-210 is a naturally occurring radionuclide with a half-life of 22.3 years. Pb-210 is a natural sediment marker suitable for dating events that have occurred over the past 100 years and has been used to measure the sedimentation rates of lake and coastal marine sediments. The objectives of this study were to measure the Pb-210 concentration in the skeletons of Japanese red coral, pink coral and white coral and to estimate the radial growth rate using Pb-210 dating method. The radial growth rate of the skeleton can be estimated by the gradual decrease in Pb-210 concentrations measured from the surface inwards. The radial growth rate of the pink coral skeleton (Corallium elatius), collected at depths of 200 to 300 m off the coast of the Ryukyu Islands, Japan, was 0.15 mm/year, so slow that it would take as long as 50 years for a colony to grow to 15 mm in diameter.",

            "abstract": "The seasonal upwelling region just south of Java, Indonesia plays a critical role in the development and evolution of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) events. In this study the effects of local and remote surface wind anomalies on the interannual variability of SST south of Java are investigated using remote sensing datasets. Though upwelling-favorable winds along the Java coast are responsible for the seasonal SST cooling (June-September) in most years, the anomalously enhanced upwelling that precedes positive IOD (IOD+) events is almost entirely associated with remote wind forcing. Surface wind-SST anomaly correlations for May-July and composites of the early phases of IOD+ events both suggest that the anomalous Java upwelling is closely linked to strengthened southeasterly winds in the eastern equatorial Ocean and along the coast of Sumatra. In contrast, only minor wind anomalies are observed along coastal Java during IOD+ years.\nTo explain the influence of remote winds on the interannual variability of Java upwelling, we also quantify oceanic Kelvin wave activity along the equator-Sumatra-Java waveguide. A sea level projection method is applied to altimetric observations, removing sea level anomaly (SLA) variations due to steric height changes and Rossby waves. The method produces a Kelvin wave amplitude that is more robustly correlated with SST cooling south of Java than gridded SLA. Extreme negative values of the Kelvin wave amplitude in May-July, corresponding to high-amplitude upwelling waves, precede all of the strong IOD+ events in the period of record. These results suggest an outsize impact from anomalous winds in the equatorial-coastal waveguide during austral late fall/early winter, and emphasize the important role of oceanic Kelvin waves in conveying remote wind forcing to the upwelling region.",

            "abstract": "Mixing state and particle non-sphericity of aerosols are two major sources of uncertainties in estimation of aerosol direct radiative forcing (DRF). To examine the sensitivity of optical properties to the mixing state, aerosols were collected on filter papers and analyzed for detailed chemical composition in Delhi national capital region (NCR) during 2007-2008. Black carbon, BC was measured directly by Aethalometer. They are grouped into four major aerosol species - dust, water soluble (WS), water insoluble (WINS) and BC. Eight different mixing cases - external mixing, internal mixing, and six combinations of core-shell type which includes two modes of dust (accumulation and coarse) have been considered for the present study. Core-shell mixing cases are BC over dust, WS over dust, BC over WS and, WS over BC. These core shell mixed components are then externally mixed with rest of the aerosol species. The aerosol optical properties for each of the mixing state cases are utilized to estimate the radiative forcing using a radiative transfer model. The surface-reaching fluxes for each of the cases are compared with measured clear-sky surface radiation. MISR aerosol product were analyzed to understand the seasonal variations of the bulk aerosol properties that may help in interpreting the sensitivity results. We observed that for the winter season (DJF), core-shell mixed case; BC over dust (accumulation) (207.7±4.28 Wm-2) and BC over WS (207.25±8.4 Wm-2) are almost comparable with measured surface flux (206.46±70.06 Wm-2), while for the monsoon season (JAS) external mixing is closest to observations. None of the mixing cases show compatible comparison, for the pre-monsoon (MAMJ) and post-monsoon season (ON). The remaining discrepancy may be attributed to the assumption of uniform vertical distribution (calculated from CALIPSO data) for each individual aerosol species, whereas ideally different vertical profile should be considered. Secondly, dust is assumed to be spherical whereas literature suggests it to be non-spherical. Three non-spherical shapes - spheroid, cylinder and chebyshev are considered and the changes in optical properties are estimated. Our results quantified the sensitivity of aerosol DRF to mixing state and non-sphericity in a representative site of the Indo-Gangetic basin, India.",

            "abstract": "Global land surface phenology regulates the climate system through the exchange of carbon, water and energy. Unfortunately, the climatic and ecosystem controls for seasonal, inter-annual and decadal dynamics of phenology are poorly understood. This lack of understanding is reflected in current dynamic global vegetation models that misrepresent vegetation phenology in comparison to satellite datasets of vegetation greenness. However, uncertainties on the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of land surface phenology arise from the variety of datasets, and methods for time series smoothing and extraction of phenological events. Consequently, the application of dynamic global vegetation models to identify seasonal to decadal controls on phenology requires firstly model improvement, and secondly the consideration of uncertainties from datasets and detection methods. Here, we improved the LPJmL dynamic global vegetation model by implementing a new phenology scheme and by optimizing the model parameters against satellite datasets of vegetation greenness, albedo and gross primary production. We evaluated the phenology of LPJmL globally against three satellite datasets of FAPAR (fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation) and by using ten methods for time series smoothing and phenology detection. Our results (1) demonstrate an improved performance of LPJmL with the new and optimized phenology model over the previous model version, and (2) show that the agreement between estimated start and end of season dates from LPJmL and the different satellite datasets is higher than the agreement between different datasets. Based on the improved LPJmL phenology, we quantify the effect of seasonal temperature, light and water controls and of processes as land use and land cover change, permafrost dynamics, fire disturbance and CO2 fertilization on the timing of start and end of the growing season. Our results demonstrate that water availability is an important seasonal phenological control not only in water-limited biomes but also in permafrost-dominated boreal forests and the arctic tundra. Besides seasonal cold temperature, seasonal light and water availability, and land use and land cover change were the prevailing controls on inter-annual variability and trends in land surface phenology.",

            "abstract": "How the biennial oscillation of global SST, one of the main components of ENSO, affects the Southeast Asia summer monsoon is analyzed. The biennial mode is extracted from the 142-year (1871-2012) Extended Reconstruction SST version 3 data using cyclostationary EOF (CSEOF) analysis. Based on regression analysis in CSEOF space, evolutions of key atmospheric variables are obtained to be consistent with the long-term variation of the biennial mode. Atmospheric variables are derived from the twentieth century (20C) reanalysis version 2 data. The biennial oscillation, primarily in the tropical Pacific, influences the monsoons in the Indo-Pacific region. Summer monsoonal change can be explained in terms of the change in monsoon precipitation accompanied with low-level moisture convergence and large-scale atmospheric circulation. In the equatorial region, SST anomaly directly triggers the vertical motion and horizontal wind such that zonal circulation across the Pacific and Indian Oceans is set up. In the subtropical Asian region, both cyclonic or anticyclonic circulation over the northwestern Pacific and the meridional circulation over the Indo-Pacific region induced by the equatorial SST change affects the Southeast Asian monsoon, and henceforth the monsoon precipitation. When positive SST anomaly develops in the eastern tropical Pacific, precipitation decreases over the tropical Indian Ocean and the Maritime Continent (10°S-5°N, 40°-150°E) and increases over Southeast Asia (5°N-20°N, 90°-150°E). With negative SST anomaly in the eastern tropical Pacific, the situation reverses. Based on the spatio-temporal evolution patterns for key physical variables and corresponding long-term variability, physical link through atmosphere-ocean interactions is explored between the biennial mode of SST and the Southeast Asian summer monsoon.",

Although large investments have been made in climate forecasting and in related monitoring of land surface conditions, the experimental streamflow monitoring and forecast system is yet to be developed for China. We propose a frame to collect near-real-time meteorological forcings from various sources, to apply land surface hydrological model to simulate hydrological states and fluxes, and to generate ensemble seasonal forecasts of river discharge and soil moisture over China. A retrospective land surface hydrologic fluxes and states dataset with a 0.25° spatial resolution and a 3-hourly time step was developed using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model as driven by gridded observation-based meteorological forcings in 1952-2012. The VIC simulations were carefully calibrated against the available streamflow observations and the simulated river discharge matched well with the observed monthly streamflow at the large river basins in China. The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) based near-real-time satellite precipitation product was adjusted at each grid to match the daily precipitation distribution with the ground observations during the period of 2000-2010. The adjusted satellite precipitation was used to simulate hydrological states and fluxes in a near-real-time manner and to provide initial hydrological conditions for seasonal forecast. The performance of hydrological monitoring and skill of seasonal streamflow prediction were assessed. The potential and challenges of using the operational monitoring and forecast system for improved flooding and drought management are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Variabilities in the onset of Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) can set an extensive imbalance in the life and economy of India as it has significant influence on the crop planning and agricultural output value. Onset is generally perceived as the beginning of rainfall along the western coast of India and hence many of the onset identification methods are based on precipitation. But any variation in the initiation of rainfall is actually caused by the changes in the large scale circulations and the pressure and temperature gradients. Therefore several indices based on large scale circulations are developed to determine the onset and are found to be resilient to bogus onsets unlike the precipitation based methods. Onset dates determined using indices or criteria based on different physical mechanisms may not be consistent with one another. Therefore, here we attempt to assess the uncertainty associated with the identification of onset dates using different methods and data. We find onset dates using moisture flux based Hydrological Onset and Withdrawal Index (HOWI), zonal wind based Onset Circulation Index (OCI) and tropospheric temperature gradient (∆ TT) based index. We observe that a huge uncertainty is associated with the onset dates identified using the three indices and different reanalysis data sets. The study reveals that the underlying physical mechanisms behind each of the selected indices influence the onset of monsoon to different degrees. We find that while the tropospheric temperature gradient has significant influence on the monsoon circulation, it shows little association with the moisture availability over the Arabian Sea region during the pre monsoon period, which is one of the reasons for the uncertainty in onset identification.",

            "abstract": "Economic development of Russian Northern Regions on permafrost resulted in a new pattern of geocryological conditions, different from natural environment. This pattern is characterized by drastic landscape transformations; changes of heat and mass transfer in the permafrost/atmosphere system; and by engineering and technical pressure upon the permafrost, leading to alteration of its physical, thermal and mechanical properties. In the northern cities this causes increase of ground temperature and intensification of hazardous cryogenic processes in areas under engineering development, reducing stability of geotechnical environment. For example, facility deformations in Norilsk in the last 15 years, became much more abundant than these revealed throughout the previous 50 years.\nIncrease in accident risk for facilities (pipelines, industrial enterprises, etc.) enhances the technogenic pressure on permafrost of the territories under development, leading to the new milestone of changes in permafrost, i.e. to creation of a new set of geocryological conditions. Cryogenic processes within the urban cryolithozone are seldom similar with these under the natural conditions: they either occur more intensively or, vice versa, attenuate under technogenic impacts, new cryogenic processes and phenomena occur, which have not been typical for a given region hitherto. A geographical distribution, evolution and other features of cryogenic processes differ considerably from natural conditions or are unprecedented at all. Peculiar natural-technogenic geocryological complices (NTGC) are formed in the urban centers, which are remarkable by the vector of permafrost evolution, by the set of cryogenic processes, by temperature trends and the other characteristics. NTGC types depend on initial natural settings and on kinds, intensity and duration of technogenic pressure. Our field surveys of permafrost and geological conditions resulted in mapping of 17 NTGC types in Norilsk, 11 types in Yamburg gas field, and 32 types along gas and oil pipelines in the north of Western Siberia. NTGC dynamics, depending on climate change, the scale of urban system, on the set of its elements and on duration of impact upon nature, and on degree of stability of natural permafrost, attracts the particular interest.",

            "abstract": "Detrital zircons of eight sand samples from upper, middle and lower streams of the Yangtze river (the world’s third largest river) and its two largest tributaries, the Han and Jialing rivers were analyzed for U–Pb–Lu–Hf–O isotope compositions. Concordant magmatic zircons from the upper Yangtze river show age peaks of 213 Ma, 423 Ma, 700–1000 Ma, 1.8–1.9 Ga and 2.4–2.7 Ga with a striking peak at 38 Ma diagnostic of the Tibetan plateau, whereas those from the middle and lower Yangtze river and its tributaries exhibit age peaks of 100–300 Ma, 410–520 Ma, 720–910 Ma, 1.7–2.0 Ga and 2.4–2.6 Ga, and lack Cenozoic ages. Proportion of the Cenozoic zircons from the upper Yangtze river decreases remarkably down the stream from elevation 4540 m to 936 m. The middle and lower Yangtze river is below 50 m in elevation. We suggest that the single sand sample collected at the mouth of the Yangtze river is not representative of the entire drainage area, as generally assumed for studies of detrital zircons from modern rivers. This may be a common case for rivers with large variations in elevation.\nDepleted mantle and arc mantle have been used to calculate crust formation model ages based on zircon Hf isotope composition. We derived theoretical equations for relationship and differences between the two model ages. Our data show excellent agreement with the theoretical derivations. They indicate linear relationship between the two model ages and their differences ranging from ~160 Ma to ~300 Ma for our data set, depending on zircon crystallization age, initial Hf isotopic ratio and 176Lu/177Hf ratio of the crustal source.\nOur zircons with mantle-like O isotope composition (δ18O =4.7–6.0 ‰) reveal four periods of crust formation at 1.2 Ga, ~1.4 Ga, 1.9 Ga and 2.8–3.2 Ga, if depleted mantle is applied. If arc mantle is adopted, they correspond to 800–920 Ga, 1.2 Ga, 1.8 Ga and 2.6–3.0 Ga, which better match the known magmatic events in the drainage area. In addition, three 290–355 Ma zircons have coeval depleted or arc mantle Hf isotope compositions, indicating Paleozoic crust growth.",

            "abstract": "We use the MIT E Mediterranean GPS velocity field and InSAR observations to constrain DEFNODE block models to investigate rates of strain accumulation for the North Anatolian Fault (NAF) system. The new observations define well a SW splay at ~36.8°E and bifurcation into S and N branches E of the Marmara Sea (~31.5°E). The GPS observations provide good spatial coverage of central Anatolia and are consistent with highly coherent plate motion for the eastern, central, and northwestern parts of the plate from the Karliova Triple Junction to S of the Sea of Marmara. Significant strain is observed along the northern part of Anatolia S of the NAF, indicating increasing rates of motion from E to W reaching 2-3 mm/yr integrated along the length of the fault (i.e., ~10% of the NAF slip rate). Non-linear post-seismic effects from the 1999 Izmit/Düzce earthquake sequence that are evident up to seven years after the events may contribute to the observed strain, although postseismic effects were corrected for in the time series; more detailed studies are continuing and will be reported. The overall strain rate of the Marmara Sea block is dominantly N-S extension, consistent with that expected for a right-step on a right-lateral fault. Our preferred block model constrained by GPS has increasing slip rates from E to W from 22-24 mm/yr along the E to E-central segment to 27-28 mm/yr along the W segment, in good agreement with our InSAR estimates using ENVISAT and ERS data. E of the “central bend” (~35°E) the Fault is under extension (1-4 mm/yr) and to the W, compression (0-6 mm/yr). Right-lateral slip rates from our preferred fault-wide model (i.e. highly simplified) are 23-24 mm/yr on the Izmit Bay segment, 17-18 mm/yr on the NW striking Princes’ Islands segment (likely including slip on faults in the Çınarcık Basin), and 23-24 mm/yr on the E-W striking Central Marmara Fault and Ganos segments. The S NAF branch has consistent modeled slip rates of 4-5 mm/yr along its full extent.",

In the East Asian/Australian sector, latitudinal profile of TEC variations in the main phase were characterized by three bands of increments and separated by weak depressions in the Equatorial Ionospheric Anomaly (EIA) crest regions, which were caused by the combined effects of disturbance dynamo electric fields (DDEF) and equatorward neutral winds. In the recovery phase, strong inhibition of EIA occurred and the summer crest of EIA disappeared on 16 July due to the combined effects of intrusion of neutral composition disturbance zone as shown by the TIME/GUVI O/N2 measurements and long-lasting daytime westward DDEF inferred from the equatorial electric electrojet (EEJ) observations. The transit time of DDEF over the dip equator from westward to eastward is around 2200 LT. In the American longitude, the salient ionospheric disturbances in the summer hemisphere were characterized by daytime periodical intrusion of negative phase for three consecutive days in the recovery phase, preceded by storm enhanced density (SED) plume in the initial phase. In addition, multiple short-lived prompt penetration electric ﬁelds (PPEF) appeared during stable southward IMF Bz in the recovery phase and were responsible for enhanced the EIA and equatorial ionospheric uplift around sunset.",

            "abstract": "Low-relief landscapes in central and eastern Tibet have been interpreted as relicts formed by lowland fluvial erosion before being uplifted to elevations exceeding 4 km a.s.l. The timing and amount of surface uplift indicated by these surfaces in Tibet and other orogens provide important constraints on geodynamic processes of crustal thickening and plateau formation. Low-temperature thermochronology and catchment-average 10Be concentrations indicate limited and low rates of long- and short-term erosion of these landscapes. But it is their morphology, dominated by gentle stream gradients, that drives the interpretation that these landscapes formed at much lower elevations than at present. Here we show for the plateau landscape of eastern Tibet that glacial erosion is ubiquitous along drainage divides that separate low-relief areas from deeply incised river gorges. The extent of late Pleistocene glaciation increases along a gradient of late Cenozoic exhumation from ~1 to >4 km indicated by apatite- and zircon-helium cooling ages. We interpret that glacial erosion effectively limits ridgeline elevations and promotes formation of low-relief landscapes in arid plateau interiors undergoing modest (<50 m Myr-1) exhumation rates. More intensive glacial erosion, associated with higher (>200 m Myr-1) exhumation rates nearer to plateau margins, produces bimodal topography, with low-relief cirques at high elevation and gentle, U-shape valleys below the equilibrium line altitudes (ELA). This yields similar mean elevations as nearby plateau surfaces, but with more rugged local relief. As rock uplift rate declines, these nascent plateau surfaces inherit low-gradient glaciated valley networks pinned by glacial erosion at their headwaters and smoothed by periglacial hillslope processes and transport-limited streams. Glacially driven formation of low-relief plateau landscapes within high-elevation eastern Tibet occurs in tandem with external drainage, and does not require uplift of a low-elevation peneplain.",

The concept is based on utilizing an existing Large Space Optics mirror having a 2.37-m aperture as the primary mirror in its receiver. This large aperture provides for hosting several transmitter systems to retrieve density, temperature, and wind measurements for several upper atmospheric species. Thus the concept provides for measurements over a wide altitude range (80-600 km), at various time and spatial resolutions, and hosting on the ISS provides nearly global coverage. The baseline concept includes transmitters and receivers for atomic oxygen (80-500 km), metastable helium (400-600 km), and sodium (80-110 km). The facility is conceived as being flexible such that other transmitter/receiver systems could be added to allow the possibility of other species to be studied, such as iron.\nThe presentation discusses the transformative science that would be gained by such an observatory by combining the nearly global coverage afforded by the ISS orbit with the extension of powerful lidar techniques to high altitudes. The challenges in realizing such an observatory are discussed, as are current plans and partnerships to meet those challenges. The presentation also reports on the development status of several components, primarily various independent transmitter/receiver systems, that are under consideration for the baseline observatory. Several institutions are performing these developments.",

The objective of the study is to provide an assessment of the capability of various global models, participating in CMIP5 project, in capturing the realistic spatial and temporal distribution of aerosol species over the Indian subcontinent. Results from our analysis show that majority of the CMIP5 models seriously underestimates the spatio-temporal variability of aerosol species over the Indian subcontinent, in particular over Indo-Gangetic Plains(IGP). Though the representation of black carbon (BC) loading in many models is fairly good, the dust loading is observed to be significantly low in majority of the models. The presence of pronounced dust activity over northern India and dust being one of the major constituent of aerosol species, the biases in dust loading has a great impact on the AOD of that region. We found that considerable biases in simulating the 850 hPa wind field (which plays important role in transport of dust from adjacent deserts) would be the possible reason for poor representation of dust AOD and in turn total AOD over Indian region in CMIP5 models. In addition, aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) underestimated/overestimated in most of the models. However, spatial distribution of ARF in multi-model ensemble mean is comparable reasonably well with observations with bias in magnitudes. This analysis emphasizes the fundamental need to improve the representation of aerosol species in current state of the art climate models. As reported in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fourth assessment report (AR4), the level of scientific understanding (LOSU) of climatic impact of aerosols is medium-low. For better understanding of short and long term implications of changing concentrations of aerosol species on climate, it is imperative to have a realistic representation of aerosol distribution over regions with high aerosol loading.",

In order to build this network, we did shake table tests to evaluate the performance of the smartphones as seismic recording instruments. We also conducted noise floor test to find the minimum earthquake signal we can record using smartphones. We added phone noises to the strong motion data from past earthquakes, and used these as an analogy dataset to test algorithms and to understand the difference of using the smartphone network and the traditional seismic network. We also built a prototype system to trigger the smartphones from our server to record signals which can be sent back to the server in near real time. The phones can also be triggered by our developed algorithm running locally on the phone, if there's an earthquake occur to trigger the phones, the signal recorded by the phones will be sent back to the server. We expect to turn the prototype system into a real smartphone seismic network to work as a supplementary network to the existing traditional seismic network.",

            "abstract": "The key computational kernel of most advanced 3D seismic imaging and inversion algorithms involves calculating solutions of the 3D acoustic wave equation, most commonly with a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methodology. While well suited for regularly sampled rectilinear computational domains, FDTD methods seemingly have limited applicability in scenarios involving irregular 3D domain boundary surfaces and mesh interiors that are best described by non-Cartesian geometry (e.g., surface topography). Using coordinate mapping relationships and differential geometry, a FDTD approach can be developed for generating solutions to the 3D acoustic wave equation that is applicable to generalized 3D coordinate systems and (quadrilateral-faced hexahedral) structured meshes. The developed numerical implementation is similar to established Cartesian approaches, save for a necessary introduction of weighted first- and mixed second-order partial-derivative operators that account for spatially varying geometry. The approach is validated on three different types of computational meshes: (1) an ``internal boundary'' mesh conforming to a dipping water bottom; (2) analytical ``semi-orthogonal cylindrical\" coordinates; and (3) analytic semi-orthogonal and numerically specified ``topographic\" coordinate meshes. Impulse response tests and numerical analysis demonstrate the viability of the approach for kernel computations for 3D seismic imaging and inversion experiments for non-Cartesian geometry scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Several temporary networks of Ocean Bottom Seismometers (OBSs) have been deployed offshore Taiwan between 2011 and 2013. The deployed water depths range from 100 m to 3000 m. For the sites at water depth shallower than 1000 m, harmonic tremors with monochromatic frequency can be observed. Harmonic tremors appearing as intense monochromatic signals last for several hours. The dominant frequency is different for each site and ranges from 6 to 12 Hz. It is noted that the harmonic tremor presents a systematic delay every day. In order to understand the mechanism of this atypical signal, we first summed the amplitude of each components every 6 minutes and calculate the spectrum of the summed amplitude respectively. The spectrum displays several picks that are corresponding to major tidal constituents such as K1, O1 and M2. This atypical signal is especially clear in shallow water, indicating that they are highly associated with the tidal variation. We suggest the harmonic tremors would be the results of seabed resonance caused by fluid (gas) beneath the seabed. The seabed harmonic tremors are related to the stress variations due to the tidal change of the oceanic load. One problem aroused by seabed tremors is that the existence of tremors would degrade the earthquake detection. In case of an earthquake occurrence, the amplitude of the harmonic tremor is too large in shallow waters, so it becomes difficult to identify the seismic phase arrivals.",

            "abstract": "On 12 May 2008, the Mw7.9 Wenchuan earthquake occurred in the Longmen Shan fault belt (China), and produced a 240km-long surface rupture along the Beichuan-Yingxiu fault. To retrieve faulting information of this destructive earthquake, the Wenchuan earthquake Fault Drilling Project (WFSD-1) was drilled to a depth of 1,200 m in 2009. The principal slip zone (PSZ) corresponding to the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake was recognized at the depth of 589m and contained carbonaceous materials within fault gouge. Rock deformation experiments suggest that graphitization occurred within the PSZ by frictional heat of faulting.\nBecause graphite is an inerasable indicator of transient frictional heating, we aim at the investigation of the graphitization along successive carbonaceous-rich gouges enclosed PSZ collected from the WFSD-1 by using the Raman spectrometer. The Raman spectra of carbonaceous materials (RSCM) include the graphite band (1580cm-1, G band) and the defect bands (1350cm-1, D1 band; 1520cm-1, D3 band). The R1 ratio of D1 over G is utilized to determine the degree of graphitization.\nThe results of RSCM analyses revealed that (1) black gouges was heated and pulverized; (2) one of the graphitized zones (low values of R1 ratio) was found at the depth of 589.22 m where was recognized as the PSZ related to the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. Consequently, we surmise graphitization took place in the PSZ during the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, and furthermore, the other graphitized zones could be signatures of transient frictional heating during ancient seismic events.",

Baekdusan, and to make volcanological interpretations of the eruptive events. Since the Millennium eruption, more than 31 eruptive events have been discovered, most of which are Plinian eruptions with volcanic ash that dispersed into the regions in the vicinity of the volcano. The minimum volume of erupted materials in 1702 is estimated to be 1.2 km3when calculated with an empirical formula using an isopach line obtained from two points 140 km away from the vent. The 1702 eruption was a paroxysmal one with VEI of 5. The historical record described a deposition of wind-modified fallout ash by movement of hot ash cloud. The 1903 record includes the event of the phreatomagmatic or vulcanian eruption that occurred within the Cheonji caldera lake. Based on the eruption records of the historical period and the 2002 precursor unrest to volcanic eruptions, Mt. Baekdusan has been evaluated and regarded as an active volcano that has the potential to erupt in the future.\nThis research was supported by a grant [NEMA-BAEKDUSAN-2012-1-2] from the Volcanic Disaster Preparedness Research Center sponsored by National Emergency Management Agency of Korea.

This study is aimed at evaluating the seismic anisotropy of the upper mantle beneath the CPR concentrating on the eastward elongation of the fast anisotropic pattern of the Eastern Alps. We use data recorded by the temporary stations, set up for the Carpathian Basin Project (CBP) extending from the Vienna basin through Hungary into Serbia, together with the petrologic indicator of deformation in basalt-hosted upper mantle xenoliths from Szentbékkála. While some of the results agree with another recently published anisotropy analysis of the Eastern Alps and earlier results for the Pannonian basin, some don’t. We reprocess data from 45 temporary CBP stations consisting recorded waveform of teleseismic events with magnitude greater than 6.0 Mw that have occurred in the distance range from 90° to 130° between 2005 and 2007. The dominant fast polarization orientation is NW-SE for the Hungarian part of the stations as well as at the stations located in the easternmost of the Pannonian Basin. This orientation matches well with the anisotropy structure under the Eastern Alps, which has been attributed to asthenospheric flow. The NW-SE trend turns more into WNW-ESE at the stations situated in Austria, mostly NW of the Vienna basin. Apart from predominately NW-SE fast orientation, there are a few measurements showing NE-SW and almost E-W trend. The SKS measurements most likely originate mainly from the asthenosphere and consequently past (Miocene) asthenospheric flow in the upper mantle may still have a significant contribution to the fast azimuth directions, however, the effect of other factors cannot be excluded.\nXenoliths from the deeper lithospheric mantle have LPO structures of minerals as A-type of olivine in which the fast axis azimuth may correspond to the shear direction, possibly present-day asthenospheric flow in the upper mantle. Large delay times (>1.0 s) might also show the contribution of asthenosphere origin of anisotropy. Considering anisotropy magnitude between 5 to 6% from petrological measurements, and 1.0 s delay time would refer to 100 to 75 km thickness of the anisotropy layer.",

            "abstract": "Wetlands are the largest natural sources for atmospheric methane (CH4). In wetlands with permanent shallow inundation, the seasonal variation of CH4 exchange is mainly controlled by temperature and phenology. In addition, ecosystem CH4 exchange varies considerably on smaller temporal scales such as days or weeks. Several single processes that control CH4 emissions on the local soil-plant-atmosphere continuum are well investigated, but their interaction on ecosystem level is not well understood yet. We applied wavelet analysis to a quasi-continuous Eddy Covariance CH4 flux time series to describe the temporal variation of ecosystem CH4 exchange within the growing season of a permanently inundated temperate fen. Moreover, we addressed time scale-specific controls and investigated whether their impact changes during the course of the growing season.\nOn large time scales of two weeks to three months, temperature explained most of the variation in ecosystem CH4 exchange. In general, the temperature in the shallow water column had the largest impact as explanatory variable, however, air temperature and soil temperature became increasingly important as explanatory variables when water level dropped slightly up to June. The diurnal variation of ecosystem CH4 exchange shifted during the course of the growing season: During a short time period at the end of April, plant activity (expressed by canopy photosynthesis) caused a diurnal variation of ecosystem CH4 exchange with peak time around noon. In the following weeks, the daily cycle of convective mixing within the water column (expressed by the water temperature gradient) gradually gained importance and caused high night-time CH4 emissions, thereby levelling off the diurnal CH4 emission pattern. Moreover, shear-induced turbulence caused short-term fluctuations of ecosystem CH4 exchange on time scales up to two hours.\nOur study highlights the need for multi-scale approaches that consider the non-stationarity of the underlying processes to adequately describe the complexity of ecosystem CH4 exchange. Moreover, we show that CH4 release processes such as convective mixing of the water column which have been mainly considered for aquatic ecosystems might also be of importance in shallowly flooded terrestrial ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "The sub-Arctic region lies in the transition zone between the warm temperate region to the south and the cold arctic region to the north. The sub-Arctic hosts sharply contrasting ecosystems that vary over short horizontal spatial scales due to the presence or absence of permafrost. In the discontinuous permafrost zone, the presence or absence of permafrost plays a dominant role to many hydrological processes including stream flow, soil moisture, and water storage dynamics. The distribution of permafrost also has a strong influence on ecosystem composition and function. The land cover and vegetation distribution is also an important parameter affecting the stream flow responses due to the large differences in the transpiration rates between coniferous and deciduous vegetation. As a result, accurate simulation of the hydrology in this region is challenging. The objectives of this study are to improve the parameterization of meso-scale hydrologic simulations in the discontinuous permafrost zone through fine-scale observation and modeling. Slope and aspect, derived from 30m Digital Elevation Model (DEM), are used as a proxy for permafrost distribution and vegetation composition. Small-scale parameterizations were conducted at the two sub-basins (area ~11km2 ) of the Caribou-Poker Creeks Research Watershed (CPCRW) using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) meso-scale hydrological model. The small scale parameterization simulation results indicate that slope and aspect based vegetation cover and soil parameter parameterization improve meso-scale hydrological modeling in these regions. In order to test the extent to which these small-scale parameterizations are valid, the Chena River Basin (area ~5,478 km2), located in Interior Alaska, is being simulated using these small-scale parameterizations. Aspect will be used as the proxy for the parameterization of vegetation cover and soil property. Results from the VIC simulation using the small scale parameterization will be compared with the results of a simulation using a meso-scale parameterization to evaluate the improvement that may be obtained from higher resolution analyses.",

            "abstract": "To partition evapotranspiration (ET) into soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration (T), a new numerical Iso-SPAC (coupled heat, water with isotopic tracer in Soil-Plant-Atmosphere-Continuum) model was developed and applied to a temperate-grassland ecosystem in central Japan. Several models of varying complexity have been tested with the aim of obtaining the close to true value for the isotope composition of leaf water and transpiration flux. The agreement between the model predictions and observations demonstrates that the Iso-SPAC model with a steady-state assumption for transpiration flux can reproduce seasonal variations of all the surface energy balance components，leaf and ground surface temperature as well as isotope data (canopy foliage and ET flux). This good performance was confirmed not only at diurnal timescale but also at seasonal timescale. Thus, although the non-steady-state behavior of isotope budget in a leaf and isotopic diffusion between leaf and stem or root is exactly important, the steady-state assumption is practically acceptable for seasonal timescale as a first order approximation. Sensitivity analysis both in physical flux part and isotope part suggested that T/ET is relatively insensitive to uncertainties/errors in assigned model parameters and measured input variables, which illustrated the partitioning validity. Estimated transpiration fractions using isotope composition in ET flux by Iso-SPAC model and Keeling plot are generally in good agreement, further proving validity of the both approaches. However, Keeling plot approach tended to overestimate the fraction during an early stage of glowing season and a period just after clear cutting. This overestimation is probably due to insufficient fetch and influence of transpiration from upwind forest. Consequently, Iso-SPAC model is more reliable than Keeling plot approach in most cases.The T/ET increased with grass growth, and the sharp reduction caused by clear cutting was well reflected. The transpiration fraction ranges from 0.02 to 0.99 during growing seasons, and the mean value was 0.75 with a standard deviation of 0.24.",

            "abstract": "Global ocean models can generally be divided into Ocean General Circulation and tidal models. Paleoclimate simulations consider dynamics due to the ocean’s general, i.e., thermohaline, wind and pressure driven circulation, while tidal dynamics most commonly are neglected due to their strict periodicity and high frequencies. Nevertheless, residual tidal currents have the potential to alter the ocean's mean circulation and therefore climate relevant dynamics.\nUsing the coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model ECHAM5/MPIOM with an integrated tidal module based on luni-solar ephemerides, we simultaneously model circulation and tidal dynamics for the Early Eocene (50Ma). The additional tidal forcing changes the ocean's mean circulation, in particular below 1000m depth compared to an Early Eocene control run without tides. Maximum velocities of the order of 1cm/s are obtained in the control run in the intermediate and deep ocean, while by a factor of 2 stronger mean currents are obtained when tidal dynamics are considered. A stronger ocean circulation leads to modified temperature transports and thus altered energy exchange at the atmosphere-ocean boundary. This affects winds and thereby energy transports in the atmosphere. As a result, near surface temperatures are locally altered by more than 1°C.",

In a meadow steppe, which has been treated with nitrogen and water addition for 3 years, we conducted a manipulated extreme drought experiment to assess whether or not nitrogen and water addition has altered sensitivity of ecosystem carbon fluxes to extreme environmental disturbance. Rainout shelters (3.5 m×3.5 m) were deployed in plots received nitrogen addition (N), water addition (W), nitrogen and water addition (NW), or control (C) treatments with each treatment has 6 replications. Drought treatment was carried out from June 17th to August 1st 2014, with a total duration of 45 days. Leaf gas exchange on dominant species (Leymus chinensis), ecosystem carbon fluxes and soil respiration were measured before drought treatment and on Day 4, 9, 16, 21, 27, 36 and 42 after the start of the drought treatment. With the progress of drought treatment, leaf carbon assimilation rate, gross ecosystem productivity, net ecosystem CO2 exchange and soil respiration showed a trend of gradually decreasing. However, the magnitude of reduction and sensitivity to drought differed among treatments with nitrogen addition plots had the greatest reduction and the highest sensitivity to the drought treatment. Ecosystem respiration remained relative constant throughout the drought treatment period for all treatments. Relative to control plots, nitrogen and water addition plots had significant higher root:shoot ratios (C 5.7±0.4; N 2.9±0.4; W 2.7±0.3; NW 3.5±0.4), which may explain the observed greater reduction in carbon assimilation and more sensitive to drought treatment in nitrogen and water addition plots. Our results suggest that the projected increase in nitrogen deposition and the amount of precipitation may alter responses of ecosystem carbon fluxes to extreme disturbance in the meadow steppe of northern China.",

            "abstract": "Constraining the temperature and heat flux of subducted slabs plays a key role in understanding the thermal evolution history of the Earth’s whole mantle. Many geodynamic models have been conducted to explore the generation and evolution of different subduction systems. But little work has been done to systematically investigate the thermal structure of subducted slabs in the deep mantle. Here, we use a 2-D spherically axisymmetric mantle convection model to study the slab temperature and heat flux variations at different depths. We first analyze the temperature and heat flux variation of subducted slabs. Then we quantify the contributions from different heat sources (i.e. adiabatic heating, viscous heating, diffusive heating and radiogenic heating) which leads to the variation of slab temperature and heat flux with depth. The effects of different physical parameters on our results are also explored, including Rayleigh numbers, internal heating generation rates, thermal expansivity, thermal diffusivity and viscosity structures. The results can be summarized as following. (1) The slab temperature increases faster with depth than a mantle adiabat. The temperature variation can be described as T(r) = T(r0)e-(1+k)Di(r-r0), where k≈1-1.5 and is not strongly affected by different model parameters, Di is the dissipation number, T(r0) is the reference temperature and r-r0 is the distance over which slabs sink. (2) Slab temperature and heat flux varies with depth due to the contribution of different heat sources. The adiabatic heating plays a dominant role (~70%), whereas the diffusive heating (~20%), viscous heating (~7-9%), and radioactive heating (~1-2%) play secondary roles in the contribution. (3) Slab mass flux significantly changes with depth, indicating that enormous mass exchange occurs between the slab and the ambient mantle during slab sinking. This process also contributes to the change of slab temperature and heat flux. Its effect is approximately equivalent to the summation of different heat sources.",

            "abstract": "According to the IPCC reports, the concentration of CO­2 has been increasing and projected to be increased significantly in future (IPCC, 2012). This can have significant impacts on climate. For instance, Dairaku and Emori (2006) examined over south Asia by doubling CO2 and documented an increase in precipitation intensities during Indian summer monsoon. This would increase natural disasters such as floods, landslide, coastal disaster, erosion etc. Recent studies investigated whether the rate of increase of extreme precipitation is related with the rate expected by Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) relationship (approximately 7% per degree temperature rise). In our study, we examine whether this rate can increase or decrease in the future regional climate scenarios over Japan. We have analysed the ensemble experiments by three RCMs(NHRCM, NRAMS, WRF) forced by JRA25 as well as three GCMs (CCSM4, MIROC5, MRI-GCM3) for the current climate (1981-2000) and future scenario (2081-2100, RCP4.5) over Japan. We have stratified the extreme (99th, 95th, 90th, 75th percentile) precipitation of daily sum and daily maximum of hourly precipitation intensities of wet events based on daily mean temperature in bins of 1°C width for annual as well as for each season (DJF, MAM, JJA, SON). The results indicate that precipitation intensity increases when temperature increases roughly up to 22 °C and further increase of temperature decreases the precipitation intensities. The obtained results are consistent and match with the observation (APHRODITE dataset) over Japan. The decrease of precipitation at higher temperature mainly can be found in JJA. It is also noticed that the rate of specific humidity is estimated higher during JJA than other seasons. The rate of increase of extreme precipitation is similar to the rate expected by CC relation except DJF (nearly twice of CC relation) in current climate. This rate becomes to be significantly larger in future scenario for higher temperatures than in current climate.\nAcknowledgement: This study is conducted as part of a research at NIED, Japan (PI: Koji Dairaku) of Research Program on Climate Change Adaptation (RECCA) and was supported by the SOUSEI Program, funded by Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Government of Japan.",

With better spatial resolution, the high-resolution frequency-domain methods, such as Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) (Schimdt, 1986; Meng et al., 2011) and the recently developed Compressive Sensing (CS) technique (Yao et al., 2011, 2013), are revealing new features of earthquake rupture processes. We have performed various tests on the methods of MUSIC, CS, minimum-variance distortionless response (MVDR) Beamforming and conventional Beamforming in order to better understand the advantages and features of these methods for studying earthquake rupture processes. We use the ricker wavelet to synthesize seismograms and use these frequency-domain techniques to relocate the synthetic sources we set, for instance, two sources separated in space but, their waveforms completely overlapping in the time domain. We also test the effects of the sliding window scheme on the recovery of a series of input sources, in particular, some artifacts that are caused by the sliding window scheme. Based on our tests, we find that CS, which is developed from the theory of sparsity inversion, has relatively high spatial resolution than the other frequency-domain methods and has better performance at lower frequencies. In high-frequency bands, MUSIC, as well as MVDR Beamforming, is more stable, especially in the multi-source situation. Meanwhile, CS tends to produce more artifacts when data have poor signal-to-noise ratio. Although these techniques can distinctly improve the spatial resolution, they still produce some artifacts along with the sliding of the time window. Furthermore, we propose a new method, which combines both the time-domain and frequency-domain techniques, to suppress these artifacts and obtain more reliable earthquake rupture images. Finally, we apply this new technique to study the 2013 Okhotsk deep mega earthquake in order to better capture the rupture characteristics (e.g., rupture area and velocity) of this earthquake.",

Results reveal that if only the aleatory variability is considered in the integration, the hazard level could be reduced about 33% at the 475-year return period, and it reduced about 36% and 50% at 10000-year and 100000-year, respectively. However, if epistemic variability is considered in the logic trees besides the aleatory variability is considered in the integration, then the hazard level is similar to that from using total variability; it shows only a little bit smaller at long return period.

            "abstract": "Mesoscale convective systems (MCS), aligned approximately parallel to the background low-level wind shear, are ubiquitous in the Eastern Pacific intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). They are believed to control the local Hadley circulation and have a nontrivial momentum feedback on the ambient shear. They also play a central role in the two-way interactions between convection and the synoptic and planetary scale waves. They do so by serving as both the building block for organized convection, which involves congestus cloud decks that moisten and precondition the environment for deep convection which in turn is lagged by stratiform anvils, and as a conveyer belt for convective momentum transport (CMT). Here, we propose an extension of the multicloud model of Khouider and Majda (2006) to make the stratiform anvils more sensitive to the background wind shear profile. We do so by invoking two layers of moisture in the free troposphere instead of one, in addition to the boundary layer. Linear stability, in a wind shear background consisting of both mid-level and low-level easterly jets, representing, simultaneously, the Tropical Easterly and African Easterly jets, features the usual synoptic scale instability of the multicloud model plus two new instability bands at the meso-alpha and meso-beta scales, respectively. The meso-alpha and meso-beta modes constitute a paradigm for the dynamics of shear parallel convective systems with the meso-alpha waves being the quasi-stationary systems. In this talk we will present limited domain 3D simulations, without rotation, of realistic shear parallel lines of convection with parallel stratifrom anvils moving eastward, with a steering level in the upper troposphere, as a mesoscale envelope of the individual convective cells moving inwards, with a steering level in the lower troposphere. This provides, among other things, an excellent example of nontrivial CMT effect on the background low-level wind. It results in a narrow channel whose width is controlled solely by the size of the convective cells, along which the parallel lines form and propagate.",

Because small mountainous rivers draining west and southwest Taiwan (basin area about 7000 km2, sediment transport 62.1–171.8 Mt/y) play a large role in coastal sediment supply, this study evaluated sediment dispersal and accumulation in the deltas of eight small mountain rivers since the last marine transgression (maximum flooding surface) about 7000 years ago (7 ka). The study area includes about 3700 km2 of subaerial delta and 2400 km2 of subaqueous delta built up by the Choushui, Peikang, Potzu, Pachang, Chishui, Tsengwen, Yenshui, and Erjen rivers. We analyzed digital elevation models derived from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data and 85 radiocarbon dates of 65 borehole cores from these deltas, plus bathymetric and core data, to constrain estimates of deltaic sediment storage. Accumulation rates in the study area have been high, averaging about 0.58 cm/yr, since 7 ka, representing a total deltaic volume of about 200 km3 over that time span.

This work intends to propose an algorithm for multiple light scattering simulations in the hazy polarized radiation field.  \nWe have already solved the scalar radiative transfer problem in the case of haze episodes with dense concentrations of atmospheric aerosols by the method of successive order of scattering, which is named scalar-MSOS. The term “scalar” indicates radiance alone in the treatment of radiative transfer problem against “vector” involving polarized radiation field.\nThe satellite polarimetric sensor POLDER-1, 2, 3 has shown that the spectro-photopolarimetry of terrestrial atmosphere is very useful for observation of the Earth, especially for aerosols. JAXA has been developing the new Earth observing system, GCOM satellite. GCOM-C will board the polarimetric sensor SGLI in 2017. It is highly likely that large-scale aerosol episodes will continue to occur, because the air pollution becomes to be severe due to both the increasing emissions of the anthropogenic aerosols and the complicated behavior of natural aerosols. Then many potential applications for the kind of radiation simulation by MSOS considering the polarization information denoted by Stokes parameters (I, Q, U, V), named vector-MSOS, are desired.\nIt is shown here that dense aerosol episodes can be well simulated by a semi-infinite radiation model composed of the proposed aerosol models. In addition our vector-MSOS is examined in practice by combination use of PARASOL/POLDER, GOSAT/CAI and Aqua/MODIS data.",

            "abstract": "Large coseismic slip along the Japan Trench during the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake (M9.0) highlighted the necessity of the re-examination of the interplate coupling on the boundary between the subducting Pacific and overriding continental plates beneath the northeastern Japanese Islands. Interplate coupling along the shallowest portion of the megathrust before the Tohoku Earthquake must have been persistent, but spatial resolution of the inversion analysis based only on terrestrial geodetic data is generally not high enough to constrain the coupling state in the far offshore area.\nMeanwhile, seafloor geodetic observation has been developed and applied off the Pacific coast of Tohoku district in this decade, and the secular displacement rates before the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake are reported by Japan Coast Guard and Tohoku University. These seafloor geodetic observation data are invaluable to estimate the interplate coupling beneath the northeastern Japan, but have been difficult to be included in the inversion analyses, because the measurements contain large uncertainties and are more sparsely sampled both in temporal and spatial domains than the terrestrial observations. To overcome this difficulty, we have taken into account the correlations between the observed displacement rates at terrestrial GPS stations in the inversion analyisis. We assumed that the covariance between the displacement rates at two different GPS sites depends on the distance, and configured the covariance between the different components, such as EW, NS and UD, by applying the result of raw GPS data processing.\nWe performed numerical test to examine the advantage of involving the covariance matrix, and concluded that the covariance between the observations should be taken into account in the inversion analysis. We appied the inversion to the actual displacement field data obtained before the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake. The results show that evident temporal change of the slip deficit had occurred after an M7.2 earthquake near off coast of Miyagi Prefecture in 2005 and continued as a slow slip event in far off Fukushima and Ibaraki Prefectures regions in 2008. However, almost full coupling was estimated along the shallowest portion of the plate interface where extremely large (> 50 m) coseismic slip occurrred during the M9.0 Tohoku Earthquake.",

            "abstract": "Unravelling the geomorphic effect of time-varying inputs into landscape evolution involves understanding the impact of numerous exogenic inputs (e.g. climate, tectonics) with different timescales on processes (e.g. vegetation growth) and geomorphic variables (e.g. topography, soils) that themselves have varying response times. If the geomorphology has long response times relative to the rate of time variation of the inputs then the geomorphology will likely respond to the statistics of the inputs, but if timescales of inputs are comparable to the response times then the deterministic details of the time-varying inputs may be important leading to co-evolution. As a first step to unravelling these interactions this paper shows that landforms have a spectrum of response times. This will be shown using a simple analytic model of landform response times that has been validated against a landform evolution model. The analytic model shows that response time (1) varies within the catchment (thus generating a spectrum of response times), (2) the spatial distribution of the response rate (relative to the spatial mean) is easily predicted based on catchment elevation, (3) is a function of whether climate or tectonics is the time-varying exogenic input, and (4) is independent of whether erosion is transport- or detachment-limited and is a function only of the erosion rate (for catchments at or near the dynamic equilibrium with the mean of the exogenic input). The paper will show that the analytic response time model, while simple in conception, is also a potentially powerful tool for understanding the importance of the response times of other, potentially co-evolving, components of the landscape (e.g. soils and vegetation) in determining the trajectory of landscape evolution. A simple example of a hillslope with time-varying soils evolution (using a calibrated pedogenesis model) will be shown. This example will demonstrate how this analytic model can be used in both modelling and field studies to simplify the interpretation and modelling of the interacting components of landscape evolution.",

            "abstract": "A major use of Discrete Fracture Network models (DFN) is to evaluate permeability and flow structure in hardrock aquifers from geological observations of fracture networks. Although extensively studied, there has been little interest in the spatial structure of DFN models, generally assumed to be Poissonian, i.e. spatially random. In this paper, we compare the results of Poissonian DFN to new DFN models where fractures result from a growth process defined by simplified rules for nucleation, growth and fracture arrest. This ‘mechanical’ model is characterized by a large proportion of T-intersections, and a distribution of the number of intersections per fracture models from Poissonian DFN. Flow distributions and permeability were calculated for 3D networks with up to 1,200 fractures and power-law fracture length distributions. For the same statistical properties in orientation and density, the permeability is significantly smaller in mechanical models than in their Poissonian equivalent, with ratios between 3 and >10. We estimate flow channeling by calculating the participation ratio of the distribution of flow per fracture (Pf), which gives the number of fractures that carry a significant part of the flow. Pf is much larger for Poissonian model than for mechanical ones. Moreover we find that permeability scales linearly with Pf, illustrating the close relationship between the geological structure, flow structure, and permeability. In most of hardrock aquifers (illustrated with examples from Sweden), the density of fracture is about a few fractures per meter, while the flow localizes in a few channels at the kilometric scale. There are several reasons why channeling is so extreme, including a large distribution of fracture transmissivities, but this observation also questions the use of Poissonian models in describing the actual fracture network structure.",

            "abstract": "The dual nature of Indian monsoon system viz. south-west and the north-east is a potent advantage for Indian economy, which is mainly supported by agriculture industry. Out of these, the south-west monsoon contributes around 70% of the total annual rainfall over India and hence, forms the major source of water for agriculture. However, the south-west monsoon possesses variability on different temporal scales such as daily, intra-seasonal, annual and decadal time-scales. Among these, understanding of the intra-seasonal variability of south-west monsoon, which is characterized by spells of good/excess rainfall (active spells) and spells of less/no rainfall (break spells) over core monsoon zone in the peak monsoon months (July and August), is the most important for crop cycle planning. Long and intense active (break) spells may lead to flood (drought) and both these situations are crucial for the critical (initial) growth period of the crops and these situations may lead to reduced yield. So, accurate prediction of these events is essential for better agricultural planning. Therefore, we evaluate the ability of, General Circulation Models (GCMs) and statistically downscaled rainfall simulations at 0.5˚ resolution, to capture the intra-seasonal variability (in terms of active and break spells) revealed by observed rainfall data. We also project the duration and frequency of active and break spells with original and downscaled GCM simulations. The analysis is performed over spatially averaged rainfall time series (over core monsoon zone) for July and August, simulated with five GCMs simulations (both with original and downscaled) over historic period (1951-2005) and extreme future (RCP45, 2071-2100). Comparison results revealed that the GCMs simulations (original and downscaled) lack the skills to reproduce active/break spells shown by observed data. Both original and downscaled GCMs showed increase/decrease in active/break spells in future and changes are more in downscaled simulations. This is not consistent with observed data and hence needs critical evaluation.",

            "abstract": "We retrieve P diving waves by applying seismic interferometry to ambient noise records observed at Long Beach, California, and invert travel times of these waves to estimate 3D P-wave velocity structure. The ambient noise is recorded by a 2D dense and large network (2500 receivers with 100-m spacing) at Long Beach, CA. In contrast from surface-wave extraction, body-wave extraction is much harder for surface acquisition because body-wave energy is smaller than surface waves. The crosscorrelation functions at a receiver pair obtained from ambient-noise data does not show clear body waves. Although we can reconstruct body waves when we stack correlation functions over all receiver pairs, we need to extract body waves at each receiver pair separately for imaging spatial heterogeneity of subsurface structure. Therefore, we employ two filters, which isolate body-wave energy and enhance signal-to-noise ratio, after correlation to seek body waves between single receiver pairs. After these steps, we can reconstruct clear body waves from each virtual source. As an application of using extracted body waves, we estimate 3D P-wave velocities with travel-time tomography. The velocities estimated from body waves are much higher resolution than those from surface waves.",

            "abstract": "We study a coronal mass ejection (CME) associated with an X-class flare, whose initiation is clearly observed in low corona with high-cadence, high-resolution EUV images, providing us a rare opportunity to witness the early evolution of an energetic CME in detail. The eruption starts with a slow expansion of cool overlying loops (~1 MK), below which a reverse S-shaped dimming is seen immediately above the brightening active region in hot EUV passbands. The dimming is associated with a rising hot arch (~6 MK), which we interpret as a preexistent, high-lying flux rope. This is followed by the arising of a double hot channel (DHC; ~10 MK) from the core of the active region. The higher structures rise earlier and faster than lower ones, with the leading front undergoing extremely rapid acceleration up to 35 km/s^2. This suggests that the torus instability is the major triggering mechanism and that it is the high-lying flux rope rather than the DHC that drives the eruption. A global EUV wave, which is closely associated with a metric type II radio burst, initiates as the laterally under-expanding loop system pushes down neighboring coronal loops that subsequently oscillate vertically. Polar plumes oscillate horizontally with the wave passing through at ~400 km/s. A local EUV wave bounded by the expanding loop system propagates first sunward and then outward at 200 km/s. The observation suggests that over-expansion is not necessary for EUV wave excitation.",

Hatori (1976) reported significant tsunami damage with estimated tsunami heights of 5 m along Kujukuri coast on the Pacific Ocean, and estimated the tsunami heights in the inner Tokyo Bay as approximately 2 m. In Tokyo Bay, there are no records that indicate the tsunami inundated residential areas, while some descriptions of tsunami are recorded in Edo, the former Tokyo. The notice from Edo City Commissioners to residences in Edo described that the tsunami came up to the upper-limit of Sumida River in Tokyo, where four major arrivals of tsunamis were reported. According to Saihen-onkoroku, tsunami came to Fukagawa, where one person was killed by throwing away from a boat affected by the tsunami.\nIn Ichikawa along the coast of Chiba Prefecture in Tokyo Bay, there are historical records about the salt farm. The embankments were collapsed and the salt farm was ruined, while the tsunami damage is not described. At this location, the damage due to storm surge in 1680 is recorded in the same document. Although storm surge damage is recorded in detail, there are no records about the Genroku tsunami, suggesting that the tsunami damage, if any, is slighter than the storm surge.\nAlong the Kujukui coast outside the Tokyo bay, the descriptions are not only damage to buildings or deaths but also an influx of sand brought by the tsunami which damaged the agricultural land.\nIn summary, it became certain that the Genroku tsunami caused some damage in the inner Tokyo Bay area. In addition, we found that a wide range of farmland was suffered by influx of sand and crops could not grow well. Such a description may be able to contribute to the tsunami deposits in future research.

            "abstract": "Warming trends are expected to reduce mountain snow pack, increase evapotranspiration, and thus diminish the sometimes limited water supplies of many intermountain streams and rivers. While it is believed that water that is transpired is no longer available for streamflow, it remains uncertain how the timing and quantity of transpiration differ between snow-dominated and rain-dominated elevations, and how alterations in transpiration in these regions affect surface water flow in mountain stream networks. To understand the spatiotemporal relationships of transpiration, we measured Douglas fir water use across the snow-rain transition line/elevation in the Pioneer Creek watershed of Idaho’s Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness in 2014. We also recorded stream discharge and monitored surface flow areal extent in four subwatersheds with contrasting geomorphologic controls on the channel network, including moraine and fault controls. We sought to test the hypotheses that (1) Douglas fir trees at snow-dominated elevations would transpire less water each year, and do so later in the melt-season compared to Douglas fir trees at rain-dominated elevations, and (2), that patterns of stream network expansion and contraction will reflect patterns of timing in transpiration rates. Preliminary analyses suggest that transpiration timing is similar across all elevations, and that stream network extent varies minimally across a 20 to 60% variation in streamflow. Summer transpiration varied more strongly with tree size and age than with elevation. We present comparisons of drainage density across the sites at different flow rates, and relate them to geomorphic controls present within each basin. Understanding the present relationships of streamflow with transpiration across snowline contributes to more robust predictions of changes in water resources as a result of climate change.",

Thermal springs in the Southern Alps, New Zealand, originate through penetration of fluids into a thermal anomaly generated by rapid uplift and exhumation on the Alpine Fault. Copland hot spring (43.629S, 169.946E) is one of the most vigorously flowing, hottest of the springs, discharging strongly effervescent CO2-rich 56-58 °C water at 6 ± 1 Ls-1. Shaking from the Mw7.8 Dusky Sound (Fiordland) 2009 and Mw7.1 Darfield (Canterbury) 2010 earthquakes, 350 and 180 km from the spring respectively, resulted in a characteristic c. 1 °C delayed-cooling over five days. The cooling responses occurred at low shaking intensities (MM III-IV) and seismic energy densities (~10-1 Jm-3) from intermediate-field distances, independent of variations in spectral frequency, without the need for post-seismic recovery before the next cooling occurred. Such shaking can be expected approximately every 1-10 years in central Southern Alps. Observed temperature and fluid chemistry responses are inferred to reflect subtle changes in the fracture permeability of schist mountains adjacent to the spring. Relatively low intensity shaking induced small permanent 10-7-10-6 strains across the Southern Alps - opening fractures which enhance mixing of relatively cool near-surface groundwater with upwelling hot water. Hydrothermal systems situated in places of active deformation, tectonic and topographic stress may be particularly susceptible to earthquake-induced transience, that if monitored may provide important information on difficult to measure hydrogeological properties within active orogens.",

We looked at grain-size distribution in the berm, collision zone, inner and outer bars, lower shoreface applying parametric methods, grain-size modal analysis and a deconvolution program (LNDoGS).\nResults indicate a mixture of three recognizable sedimentary types (ST1 – ST3 – ST4) and explain grain-size distribution (GSD) of the sands in both multimodal and apparently unimodal GSDs. ST1 flows from the River Rhone, ST3 and 4 are local components originating from either fluvial input or nearshore reworking of Quaternary sediments.\nA fourth component (ST2), derived in situ from ST1, is found far from the overwhelming footprint of the Rhone river sands, westward in the lower shoreface.\nThe mixing process entails significant variations in grain-size indices and skewness appears as a very sensitive and meaningful parameter. Skewness and bimodality, generated in all zones, are two aspects of the mixing process, depending on the relative proportions of STs.\nUsing LNDoGS makes deciphering the STs a lot easier. It also reveals that some GSDs can result from a combination of 3 sedimentary variants (SVs) belonging to the same ST (monotype grain-size distributions). Monotype mixtures are very abundant on the lower shoreface, significantly present on the berm and inner bar but rare in the most dynamic zones. On the berm they tend towards a lognormal model for only bedload is present in the swash. This trend towards a lognormal model can also be observed on the lower shoreface, possibly indicating the occurrence of suspension as a dominant process.\nThus, each segment of the nearshore - foreshore profile can be characterized using coarseness, skewness sign, the presence of locally generated ST2, abundance of bimodalities, occurrence of SVs. Finally, a more detailed description of the spatial properties of grain-size distributions could help explore possible mechanisms underlying sediment sorting in the coastal zone and provide a useful set of indices for paleogeographic reconstructions.",

            "abstract": "It is investigated how the simulated Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) differs among various coupled general circulation models (CGCMs), and how it is related to the simulated atmospheric variation in the North Pacific. We analyzed the spatial pattern of the PDO from the dataset of the historical runs of the 26 CGCMs of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Our result shows that the inter-model diversity in the PDO pattern is closely related to diverse displacements of the simulated Aleutian Low (AL), that is, the PDO pattern is highly dependent on longitudinal and latitudinal position of the anomalous AL associated with the PDO (PDO-related AL; ALPDO). It is particularly interesting that in the models that have the southward shift of the ALPDO, the North Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) associated with the PDO tend to modulate the atmospheric circulation strongly, implying strong SST feedback to the atmospheric circulation in mid-latitudes. This is supported by showing that these models have relatively strong persistency of the PDO. It is also found that the PDO in these models is highly correlated with the variation of the Kuroshio Extension current, implying that ocean dynamical processes can play an important role in developing SSTAs.",

            "abstract": "The nature of turbulence at kinetic scales is important since turbulence energy is believed to dissipate as heat at these scales. Here we report our several work on the solar wind turbulence at ion kinetic scales using the k-filtering technique.\nWe found evidence of ion cyclotron resonance in solar wind intervals. In the wave vector space, in addition to the commonly observed population of magnetic field fluctuations propagating at quasi-perpendicular angles to the global mean field B0, a population propagating at quasi-parallel angles are also observed with no local plasma instabilities identified. At low wavenumbers (kv_A/Omega_p <= 0.6 ) both components are present, and have similar powers, while at higher wavenumbers (kv_A/\\Omega_p> 0.6) only the perpendicular component can be identified.\nA statistical study of 52 intervals of solar wind finds that the turbulence is predominantly highly oblique to the magnetic field with perpendicular wavenumbers much greater than parallel wavenumbers, and propagates slowly in the plasma frame with most points having frequencies smaller than the proton gyrofrequency. Weak agreement is found that turbulence at the ion kinetic scales consists of kinetic Alfven waves and coherent structures advected with plasma bulk velocity plus some minor more compressible components. The results suggest that anti-sunward and sunward propagating magnetic fluctuations have similar nature in both the fast and slow solar wind. The fast wind was shown to have significantly more anti-sunward flux than sunward flux and the slow wind appears to be more balanced at ion kinetic scales.\nThe fluctuated magnetic field and magnitude of the magnetic field are used to compute the power of incompressible and compressible turbulence for the fast solar wind. It is found that Taylor's frozen-in hypothesis may break down for compressible turbulence at the ion kinetic scales, suggesting that whistler waves may contribute to the compressible turbulence on the scales. The power of compressible turbulence peaks at approximately the same location in the wave number space as that of the incompressible turbulence at each sampling frequency. This indicates that the compressible plasma turbulence may be passively cascaded to ion scales by the Alfvenic incompressible turbulence.",

Using astrometry.net and other open source libraries we have developed a software toolkit to automatically reconstruct the pointing of the images from the visible starfield and hence project the auroral images in geographic and geomagnetic coordinates.

            "abstract": "The wetness of the soil prior to a rainfall event plays an important role in determining how much rainfall is converted to runoff. This can impact the size and timing of any resulting flood. This study used dynamically downscaled GCM rainfall projections from the NSW / ACT Regional Climate Modelling (NARCliM) project to examine the joint probability of extreme rainfall and antecedent soil moisture prior to extreme rainfall events. The NARCliM project has produced an ensemble of regional climate projections for south-east Australia, in particular 10 by 10 km resolution hourly rainfall data. 12 different projections of rainfall have been produced for three 20 year time periods; 1990-2009, 2020-2039 and 2060-2079. An hourly time series of soil moisture was simulated from each of the rainfall data sets using the Australian Water Balance Model (AWBM). The soil moisture and rainfall time series were then examined to determine the relationship between the extreme rainfall and the median antecedent soil moisture. Rainfall events of varying durations were considered. For short duration rainfall events, an initial analysis showed that a clear relationship exists between the antecedent soil moisture and extreme rainfall; as the rainfall depth increases so too does the antecedent soil moisture. For the site considered in this study, the extreme future rainfall depths are predicted to increase, which will result in an increase in the soil moisture. This implies that extreme flooding events will increase in magnitude for the study site. Results from the 12 rainfall datasets and three time periods will be presented. The impact of climate change on the soil moisture / extreme rainfall relationship will also be presented.",

            "abstract": "Several studies suggest that the North Atlantic Ocean is of particular importance for the climate variability, especially that of western Europe (Schlesinger M. E. & Ramankutty 1994, Knight J., Folland C. K. & Scaife A. 2006). The changes in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures are related to the thermohaline's circulation strength (Kushnir Y., 1994) and affected by volcanic eruptions (Church J.A, White N.J. & Arblaster J.M. 2005), due to their release of aerosols into the stratosphere.\nIn this study we examine the signal of tropical volcanic eruptions in the temperatures of the North Atlantic Ocean in various depths (6, 100, 560 and 3070 m from the sea surface), for the past millennium. The temperatures are derived from the comprehensive COSMOS Earth System Model (ECHAM5-OM at T30 spatial resolution) and are presented for a control run and for three fully forced ensemble simulations including changes in orbital, solar, volcanic, land use and greenhouse gas changes.\nThe model shows a response in the years following volcanic eruptions, being mostly pronounced after the large eruptions that took place between 1200 and 1300 AD, as well as at the beginning of the 19thcentury. The strongest impact on the ocean temperatures, due to the increased atmospheric optical depth, is evident in the uppermost level, especially for two out of the three ensemble simulations. In these simulations a pronounced decrease in the ocean temperature between 1400 and 1500 AD is observed due to the increase of the aerosol effective radius. In the mixed ocean layers the response to volcanic aerosols is more obvious in the third ensemble simulation, whereas in the deep ocean the temperatures do not seem to be strongly affected by volcanic eruptions.\nSchlesinger, M.

            "abstract": "In a world of increasing food insecurity the development of modeling tools capable of supporting on-farm decision making processes is highly needed to formulate sustainable irrigation practices in order to preserve water resources while maintaining adequate crop yield. The design of these practices starts from the accurate modeling of soil-plant-atmosphere interaction. We present an innovative 3D Soil-Plant model that couples 3D hydrological soil dynamics with a mechanistic description of plant transpiration and photosynthesis, including a crop growth module. Because of its intrinsically three dimensional nature, the model is able to capture spatial and temporal patterns of crop yield over large scales and under various climate and environmental factors. The model is applied to a 25 ha corn field in the Venice coastland, Italy, that has been continuously monitored over the years 2010 and 2012 in terms of both hydrological dynamics and yield mapping. The model results satisfactorily reproduce the large variability observed in maize yield (from 2 to 15 ton/ha). This variability is shown to be connected to the spatial heterogeneities of the farmland, which is characterized by several sandy paleo-channels crossing organic-rich silty soils. Salt contamination of soils and groundwater in a large portion of the area strongly affects the crop yield, especially outside the paleo-channels, where measured salt concentrations are lower than the surroundings. The developed model includes a simplified description of the effects of salt concentration in soil water on transpiration. The results seem to capture accurately the effects of salt concentration and the variability of the climatic conditions occurred during the three years of measurements. This innovative modeling framework paves the way to future large scale simulations of farmland dynamics.",

However, in many agricultural impact assessments, future irrigation scenarios are externally given and do not consider the space-time varying available agricultural water under changing climate and land use. For these reason, this study aimed to (1) develop a crop-river coupled model that can simultaneously simulate crop growth and yield over a river watershed, river discharge and their dynamic interactions by embedded a large-area crop model, PRYSBI-2 [Sakurai et al., 2014] into a hydrologic model, H08 [Hanasaki et al., 2008]; (2) apply the developed coupled model to the Songhua River watershed in Northeast China and evaluate the model’s performance by comparing the historical model simulations outputs; (3) assess the effects of adaption measure expanding irrigated area under climate change. The modeled year-to-year variations in soil moisture were comparable to the reference with the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) of 0.75 (p<0.001) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 13 %. The modeled river discharge accurately matched with the observation data with the r of 0.83 (p<0.01) and RMSE of 22 %. And the modeled soybean yields were quantitatively comparable to the reference with the r of 0.66 (p<0.001) and RMSE of 21 %. We made simulations to project the changes of potential soybean production under climate change scenarios and irrigation area expanding scenarios. It was projected that the soybean production effectively increase until the irrigated area has been increased 5 times compared to around the year 2000. However, the more increase in the irrigated area would bring significant reduction of the increase rate in soybean production due to depletion of available agricultural water resources.",

A study of hiillslope runoff and erosion processes, coducted in the Negev desert, indicated systematic differences in sediment concentration and erosion rates between rocky and colluvial surfaces.. Field observations drew attention to intense burrowing and digging activity of Porcupines and Isopods. Erosion rates were always higher over the rocky than over the colluvial areas. The monitoring of this activity, based on a grid system which consists of rows 5m wide, lasted ten years. Data obtained suggest a link between the spatial pattern of bioturbation and that of soil erosion. The study also examines, through feebback processes , the vregulatory role of bioturbation on soil erosion and soil forming processes. Due to bioturbation two distinct envirobments were recognized.The rocky, upper hilllsope areas, are characterized by a positive feedback process. High runoff and erosion rates remove salt from the soil, preventing thus salt accumulation. At the same time the colluviual slope sections absorb, at most storms, all runoff over the upper rocky slope sectioins leading, over time, tooil salinization",

            "abstract": "Drastic topography changes have significant effects on the propagation of seismic waves, which leads to perturbations in waveforms and therefore the arrival times and amplitudes of seismic phases. Previous studies have focused on the influence of topography on the peak amplitudes of earthquake-induced strong ground motions in order to make realistic and reliable assessment of seismic hazard. Various of factors contribute to the topography-induced waveform changes, including not only the geometrical shape of the surface itself, but also the path-related incidence angles of the seismic waves which are dependent on the location of the receiver site as well as the azimuth, distance and depth of the earthquake. In this study, we conduct a quantitative assessment on the changes to the arrival times and amplitudes of regional seismic phases caused by the topography-induced waveform perturbations. Synthetic seismograms calculated by the finite-difference method in three-dimensional anelastic structure with realistic surface topography are used to investigate the effect of topography coupled with the path-related factors on the frequency-dependent phases and amplitudes. The resulting quantitative assessments of topography effects can be used to estimate the potential biases in seismic tomography due to the omission of topography in modeling regional seismic waveforms.",

            "abstract": "Advances in observational and computational technologies in the past two decades have made it possible for automatic, real-time solutions of the focal mechanisms of earthquake point sources. However, seismic wave radiations from moderate and large earthquakes often exhibit complex directivity behavior that can only be explained by rupture processes that are finite in both space and time. We develop an efficient and effective approach to determining the finite-rupture models of moderate and large earthquakes by fitting synthetic and recorded broadband waveforms. A Green tensor database is established which enables rapid calculations of accurate synthetic seismograms in three-dimensional structural models with realistic surface topography without the need for high-performance computing. A three-step process is used in solving for a finite-source model: A point-source focal mechanism is determined in the first step. Then, the two nodal planes in the point-source solution are used as trial candidates to solve for an average finite-rupture model and identify the actual fault plane. In the final step, a finite-fault slip distribution inversion is carried out based on the identified fault plane. Applications to moderate events (MW≈6) in Taiwan show that our source inversion technique is effective for semi-automatic, near real-time determinations of finite-source parameters for seismic hazard mitigation purposes.",

            "abstract": "Glacier mass balance forms a vital link between climate change and glacier dynamics and hydrology, and its variation is the best way to infer climate change from glaciers. The Altai Mountains are located in the southern periphery of the Asian Arctic basin and the most northern periphery of the central Asia mountain system, which contains 1280 glaciers covering an area of 1191 km2. These glaciers are at the headwaters of many prominent rivers, which affects the water discharge of large rivers such as the Ob and Yenisey rivers. Although several studies have been proposed for glacier changes in this region based on satellite data, so far no study focuses on glacier mass change in the whole Altai Mountains. Therefore, we implement a temperature-index-based glacier model that considers the glacier area evolution and the refreezing of meltwater, to reconstruct glacier mass balance of the Altai Mountains, forcing the model by a Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulations with 5-km resolution and glacier inventory data. Compared to available observed mass balances on three glaciers of this region, the model can reproduce reasonably well the decadal glacier mass changes. According to our calculations, the glaciers in the whole region show a mean annual balance of -0.8 m water equivalent per year over the period 1988-2012. Most Altai glaciers have experienced negative net surface mass balance over the study period, especially in the western part of the Altai Mountains. In addition to rising temperature, decreased precipitation in the western part of the Altai Mountains and increasing precipitation in the eastern part is probably driving these systematic differences.",

            "abstract": "We report results with Indian Gabbro (Vs=3.62km/s) that are obtained from a series of large-scale biaxial friction experiments conducted at NIED. We focus on strain gage array data of stick-slip events loaded with 0.01mm/s and under 6.7MPa normal stress, and find the following: (1) During early stage when the contact surface is relatively intact, ruptures mainly behave as slow-slip events, with a transition from extremely slow slip (~ 10 m/s) to normal slow slip (~ 100 m/s). (2) With the accumulation of total fault displacement, grooves indicative of locally high normal-stress patches (i.e. asperities) are generated along the sliding surface, which are primarily elongated along the loading direction and are associated with gouge formation. On the other hand, the rest part of the surface continues being polished, indicated by a contrast in light reflectivity with respect to the initial level. At this stage, rupture speeds start to increase but are still well below the shear wave speed (~ 1/4Vs). (3) After long enough total fault displacement (> 500mm), grooves and gouges of a sufficient amount are generated. The following ruptures then show a classic behavior as documented by Ohnaka (2000), which composes of a quasi-static phase, an accelerating phase, and an unstable propagation phase. Although the terminal propagation speed usually reaches a level comparable to the shear wave speed, there is a significant variability for the earlier phases among different events, suggesting that those earlier phases are more sensitive to the evolving local fault structure and/or stress heterogeneity. Further investigation reveals that fault properties (e.g. grooves and gouges) as a function of the accumulated displacement can influence both the macroscopic and the local strain drop, which are most-likely responsible for the evolution of rupture behavior under the same macroscopic loading conditions. We aim to quantify this relation in a continued study.",

            "abstract": "We are developing a method for observation of seafloor crustal deformation using kinematic GPS and acoustic ranging system. The system measures seafloor crustal deformation by determining position of benchmarks on the seafloor using a vessel which link-up GPS and acoustic signals. Acoustic ranging is used to measure distance between the vessel and the seafloor benchmarks. And kinematic GPS is used to locate the moving vessel every 0.2 seconds. Now we have deployed 4 seafloor benchmark units at Suruga Bay and 4 units at Kumano Basin both off-pacific coast Japan. At each survey site, three seafloor transponders are settled to define a benchmark unit. In this system, each measurement takes about ten hours and both sound speed structure and the benchmark unit positions were determined simultaneously for the each measurement using a tomographic technique. This tomographic technique was adopted based on assumption that the sound speed structure is horizontally layered and changes only in time, not in space. However, when sound speed structure has a heterogeneity, the assumption of a horizontal layering causes systematic error in the determination of seafloor benchmarks(Ikuta et al 2009AGU). So we are developing a new system using multi-buoy. Multi-buoy plays the role of vessel. Conducting observation using the buoys, we can estimate spatial variation of sound speed structures as a sloped structure every moment. With the single vessel system, we solve a kind of average sound speed over the different paths to the three seafloor transponders. Using the multi-buoy system, they can detect the lateral variation as difference of the average sound speeds obtained by different buoys, which improve the accuracy of the benchmark locations. In November 2013, Observation of seafloor crustal deformation using the buoys was held in Suruga Bay. In this study, we report the result of estimations of heterogeneous sound speed structures.",

Although people receive many benefits from nuclear energy, there are inevitably environmental pollutions as well as human health threats posed by the radioactive materials releases from nuclear waste disposed in geological repositories or accidental releases of radionuclides from nuclear facilities. Theoretical studies have been undertaken to understand the transport of radionuclides in subsurface environments because that the radionuclide transport in groundwater is one of the main pathway in exposure scenarios for the intake of radionuclides. The radionuclide transport in groundwater can be predicted using analytical solution as well as numerical models. In this study, we simulate the transport of the radionuclide decay chain using HYDROGEOCHEM. The simulated results are verified against the analytical solution available in the literature. Excellent agreements between the numerical simulation and the analytical are observed for a wide spectrum of concentration. HYDROGECHEM is a useful tool assessing the ecological and environmental impact of the accidental radionuclide releases such as the Fukushima nuclear disaster where multiple radionuclides leaked through the reactor, subsequently contaminating the local groundwater and ocean seawater in the vicinity of the nuclear plant.",

            "abstract": "Arctic ice masses have rapidly lost mass from the mid-1990s, through a combination of negative surface mass balance and accelerated ice discharge from marine-terminating outlet glaciers. In the past decade, substantial mass deficits have been identified on Novaya Zemlya, Russian High Arctic, and its outlet glaciers have retreated rapidly, likely due to declining sea ice concentrations. Although studies from the Greenland Ice Sheet suggest that outlet glacier retreat impacts markedly on inland ice at decadal timescales, its influence on Novaya Zemlya remains unclear and is complicated by the presence of surge-type glaciers. Here we use multiple satellite imagery sources to assess decadal-scale (1980s – 2010s) changes in the frontal position, surface elevation, terminus velocity and glaciological structure of outlet glaciers on the northern ice cap, Novaya Zemlya. We observe a substantial acceleration in retreat rates during the study period: recession was comparatively slow between the mid-1980s and circa. 2000, it increased markedly during the 2000s and further accelerated from 2011 onwards. Total retreat rates (1980s – 2010s) showed a strong dependence on terminus type: recession on marine-terminating outlets was up to an order of magnitude greater than on land- or lake-terminating glaciers, with the latter retreating somewhat quicker than those ending on land. We observed substantially higher retreat rates on the Barents Sea coast than on the Kara Sea, and greater recession on the northern Kara Sea coast than in the south. We detect frontal advance on three glaciers in the 2010s, which contrasts markedly with the strong retreat observed elsewhere. We suggest that this results from recent surge activity and is supported by the identification of surge-related features (e.g. looped moraines) on these outlets. Future work will use ASTER and Corana imagery to map surface elevation change and feature tracking will be applied to optical imagery, in order to quantify velocity changes proximal to the study glacier termini. This will allow us to assess the decadal-scale dynamic response of Novaya Zemlya outlet glaciers to frontal retreat and to identify dynamic changes associated with surging behaviour.",

            "abstract": "The summer rainfall climate of East Asia underwent large and abrupt changes in response to precessional forcing, glacial-interglacial cycles as well as abrupt changes to the North Atlantic during the last glacial. Current interpretations of said changes are typically formulated in terms of modulation of summer monsoon intensity, and do not account for the known complexity in the seasonal evolution of East Asian rainfall, which exhibits sharp transition from the Spring regime to the Meiyu, and then again from the Meiyu to the summertime.\nWe explore the interpretation that East Asian rainfall climate undergoes a modulation of its seasonality during said paleoclimate changes. Following previous suggestions, we focus on role of the westerly jet: namely that the latitude of this westerly jet relative to Tibet is critical in determining the stepwise transitions in East Asian rainfall seasons. In support of this linkage, we show evidence from observational data for such a linkage in the timing of the Meiyu and Summer transitions, with more northward-shifted westerlies associated with earlier transitions.\nWe similarly suggest that East Asian paleoclimate changes resulted from an altered timing in the northward evolution of the jet and hence the seasonal transitions, in particular the transition of the jet from south of the Plateau to the north that determines the seasonal transition from Spring rains to the Meiyu. In an extreme scenario – which we speculate the climate system tended towards during stadial (cold) phases of D/O stadials and periods of low Northern Hemisphere summer insolation – the jet does not jump north of the Plateau, essentially keeping East Asia in prolonged Spring conditions.\n We show that this hypothesis can explain a key paleoproxy signature of D/O stadials over East Asia, namely the heavier mean δ18O of precipitation as recorded in speleothem records. The southward jet position prevents the low-level monsoonal flow – which is isotopically light – from penetrating into the interior of East Asia; as such, precipitation there will be heavier, consistent with speleothem records. This hypothesis can also explain other key evidences of East Asian paleoclimate changes, in particular the occurrence of dusty conditions during North Atlantic stadials, and the southward migration of the Holocene optimal rainfall.",

            "abstract": "Assimilating remotely sensed atmospheric parameters are critical for improving numerical weather prediction model skill, and especially for the prediction of tropical cyclone (TC) activities. The model skill is assessed by comparison with IBTRACs. In this talk, we will present results recently obtained using the weather research and forecasting data assimilation (WRF_DA) code. In the four TC cases studied (between 2003 and 2009), QuikSCAT measured near surface wind vectors (within a 6-hour assimilation window centered at model initiaisationl time) are assimilated. We further assimilated Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) clear sky radiance and SSM/I measured total precipitable water vapour. By comparing with the control case (without assimilating any remote sensing data), the information content and impact of individual data sources are estimated. Possible use of cloudy and cloud contaminated radiances also will be assessed. Since the lifetime of a satellite platform is limited (~10 years), we further discuss a generic quality control scheme and an objective scheme of channel selection. This differs from the WRF_DA default procedure. An efficient method of obtaining bias correction coefficients are presented together with updating these coefficients in the prediction cycle. ",

            "abstract": "After the last decade of extreme tsunami events with catastrophic damage to infrastructure and a horrendous amount of casualties, it is clear that more and better paleotsunami records are needed to improve our understanding of the recurrence intervals and intensities of large-scale tsunamis. Coastal lakes (e.g. Bradley Lake, Cascadia; Kelsey et al., 2005) have the potential to contain long and continuous sedimentary records, which is an important asset in view of the centennial- to millennial-scale recurrence times of great tsunami-triggering earthquakes. Lake Huelde on Chiloé Island (42.5°S), Chile, is a coastal lake located in the middle of the Valdivia segment, which is known for having produced the strongest ever instrumentally recorded earthquake in 1960 AD (MW: 9.5), and other large earthquakes prior to that: i.e. 1837 AD, 1737 AD (no report of a tsunami) and 1575 AD (Lomnitz, 1970, 2004, Cisternas et al., 2005). We present a new 5400 yr-long paleotsunami record with a Bayesian age-depth model based on 23 radiocarbon dates that exceeds all previous paleotsunami records from the Valdivia segment, both in terms of length and of continuity. 18 events are described and a semi-quantitative measure of the event intensity at the study area is given, revealing at least two predecessors of the 1960 AD event in the mid to late Holocene that are equal in intensity. The resulting implications from the age-depth model and from the semi-quantitative intensity reconstruction are discussed in this contribution.",

By comparing the statistical distribution of the daily precipitation frequency for the whole study period, and those for flood occurrence days, we found that the distributions of the precipitation frequency for the flood occurrence days are corresponding to those for the whole study period. These results indicate that we can estimate flood damage based on frequency of daily precipitation. Based on these results, we estimated the flood damage for Tokyo based on distribution of daily precipitation frequency. We then created a flood-risk curve that represented the relationship between damage and exceeding probability of a flood. By comparing the newly developed flood-risk curve, based on the precipitation frequency, with those in the previous studies, we indicated that a newly developed flood-risk curve could evaluate the potential flood risk in Tokyo with high accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Based on the method FMNEAR, we propose an approach to discriminate the fault plane (FP) from the auxiliary one for earthquakes down to Mw 3.8 using a minimum of 6 local strong motion records. Faulting characteristics and source time function (STF) are also determined.\nIn a first step, a precise focal mechanism (FM) is computed with all representative solutions. Then, in a second step, fault length and maximum duration of the STF are tested on all best solutions defined previously. The discrimination of the FP is finally performed with a local grid search on best FM solutions (on strike and dip) using the best fault length and STF duration.\nWe obtain by this way a refined geometry of the FP with its corresponding fault slip distribution. The resulting slip map gives directly access to rupture dimension and rupture characteristics (directivity, rake variation, slip patches). For each event, location and depth are tested, a 1D velocity model is defined for each station and Mw is provided. Synthetic tests are performed at each step of the approach in order to confirm its reliability.\nThis approach is tested in the Longitudinal Valley (eastern Taiwan) where a dense network of stations is available and monitor the high activity generated by the plate boundary of the ongoing Taiwanese orogen. The final goal of this approach, will be to retrieve 3D geometry of active and secondary structures thanks to small to moderate earthquakes. In addition to geometry, rupture characteristics will be available for each fault portion as well as any time / location variation of those characteristics.",

The \"MUlti-PUrpose probe for surface and sub-surface Science\" MUPUS will measure the temperature profile up to a depth of 30cm and the thermal conductivity using a self-penetrating needle-probe, the surface brightness temperature using a radiometer, the hardness of the comet soil by measuring the progress of insertion of the probe and the deceleration of the two anchors that will be shot to fix the lander. The anchors are equipped with an accelerometer and a temperature sensor each. The self-penetrating needle-probe, or penetrator for short, has an electro-magnetically driven hammer mechanism on top and a rod of about 1cm diameter and 32cm length equipped with 16 temperature sensors that can also be heated with controlled power of up to 2W to measure the thermal conductivity. MUPUS is stored on the lander but will be deployed to a distance of about 1m from the lander using a motor driven deployment device that extends from the lander balcony. The science goals of the instrument are to measure the temperature profile in the near surface layers of the comet and the heat flow into the comet nucleus to complement the surface energy balance of the nucleus with a quantity that is difficult to measure remotely or to estimate. The thermal conductivity can be further used to characterize the near surface layers and possibly determine the depth to pristine ice. The first science sequence will allow for insertion of the probe and for a first series of temperature and thermal conductivity measurements. MUPUS is looking at the long-term science sequence to complement these data. At the AGU fall meeting – assuming a successful landing and installation of the probe - we will report on results from the first science sequence.",

This particularity is already being observed currently and is also simulated by climate models. Feedback mechanisms associated with this particularly strong warming, or Artic Amplification, are multiple. The relative role of the different feedbacks are not easy to evaluate precisely using direct model outputs. In this study, we use the “radiative kernels” method (Soden et al, 2008) to perform a multi-model intercomparison analysis. The radiative decomposition is performed at the surface instead of the top of atmosphere in order to consider surface temperature changes specifically. The kernels are derived from the MIROC3.2 model. The intercomparison includes 32 CMIP5 coupled models, whose outputs are analyzed for changes from the late 20th to the late 21st centuries following the rcp4.5 scenario. We consider results separately for land and oceanic surfaces, as the mechanisms and orders of magnitude differ substantially for these two types of surface. We also consider seasons separately as we show that seasonality in the feedback processes is determinant.",

            "abstract": "Climate model experiments reveal that transient global warming is nearly proportional to cumulative carbon emissions on multi-decadal to millennial timescales. However, it is not quantitatively understood how this near linear dependence between warming and cumulative carbon emissions arises in transient climate simulations, nor why the proportionality of warming is largely independent of emission scenario. Here, we present the first theoretical equation for how global warming depends on cumulative carbon emissions over time for an atmosphere-ocean system. For the present, our theory identifies a sensitivity of surface warming to emission of 1.5±0.7 K for every 1000 Pg of carbon emitted, reducing by only 10 to 20% by the end of the century and beyond. The sensitivity remaining nearly constant over time is due to partially-opposing thermal and carbon responses in a coupled atmosphere-ocean, as well as reflecting how warming is proportional to cumulative carbon emissions after many centuries. Incorporating estimates of terrestrial carbon uptake into our analysis reduces the sensitivity of surface warming to 1.1±0.5 K for every 1000 Pg of carbon emitted, but does not significantly alter the percentage reduction in warming sensitivity over the 21st century. Our theory provides an analytical framework to interpret model projections of global warming.",

            "abstract": "Damage zones of active faults control both resistance to rupture and transport properties of the fault. Hence, knowing the rock damage’s origin is important to constrain its properties. Here we study experimentally the damage generated by a succession of dynamic loadings, a process mimicking the stress history of a rock sample located next to an active fault.\nA propagating rupture generates high frequency stress perturbations next to its tip. This dynamic loading creates pervasive damage (pulverization), as multiple fractures initiate and grow simultaneously. Previous single loading experiments have shown a strain rate threshold for pulverization. Here, we focus on conditions below this threshold and the dynamic peak stress to constrain: 1) if there is dynamic fracturing at these conditions and 2) if successive loadings (cumulative seismic events) result in pervasive fracturing, effectively reducing the pulverization threshold to milder conditions.\n Monzonite samples were dynamically loaded (strain rate > 50 s-1) several times below the dynamic peak strength, using a Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar apparatus. Several quasi-static experiments were conducted as well (strain rate < 10-5-s). Samples loaded up to stresses above the quasi-static uniaxial compressive strength (qsUCS) systematically fragmented or pulverized after four successive loadings. We measured several damage proxies (P-wave velocity, porosity), that show a systematic increase in damage with each load. In addition, micro-computed tomography acquisition on several damage samples revealed the growth of a pervasive fracture network between ensuing loadings. Samples loaded dynamically below the qsUCS failed along one fracture after a variable amount of loadings and damage proxies do not show any a systematic trend. Our conclusions is that milder dynamic loading conditions, below the dynamic peak strength, result in pervasive dynamic fracturing. Also, successive loadings effectively lower the pulverization threshold of the rock. However, the peak loading stress must exceed the qsUCS of the rock, otherwise quasi-static fracturing occurs. Pulverized rocks found in the field are therefore witnesses of previous large earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "With the launch of the first radar altimeter by ESA in 1992, more than two decades of radar altimetry data are now available. Therefore, one goal of ESA's Ice Sheet Climate Change Initiative is the estimation of surface elevation changes of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) based on ERS-1, -2, Envisat, CryoSat-2, and, in the longer term, Sentinel-3 data. This will create a data record from 1992 until present date. In addition to elevation-change records, such data can be processed to produce digital elevation models, or DEMs, of the ice sheets. The DEMs can be used to correct radar altimetry data for slope-induced errors resulting from the large footprint (e.g. 2–10 km for Envisat vs. 60 m for ICESat laser altimetry) or to correct for the underlying surface topography when applying the repeat-track method. DEMs also provide key information in e.g. SAR remote sensing of ice velocities to remove the interferograms' topographic signal or in regional climate modeling.\nThis work focuses on the development of a GrIS DEM from Envisat and CryoSat-2 altimetry, corrected with temporally and spatially coincident NASA ICESat, ATM, and LVIS laser data. The spatial resolution is 2 x 2 km and the reference year 2010. It is based on 2009 and 2010 data, the 2009 data adjusted to 2010 by accounting for the intermediate elevation changes. This increases the spatial data coverage and reduces data errors. The GIMP DEM has been corrected for negative elevations and errors in the north, and used to constrain the final DEM.\nThe recently acquired observations and increased data coverage give a strong advantage to this DEM relative to previous models, based on lower-resolution, more temporally scattered data (e.g. a decade of observations or only ICESat data, limited to three annual 35-day acquisition periods). Furthermore, as surface changes occur continuously, an up-to-date DEM is necessary to correctly constrain the observations, thereby ensuring an accurate change detection or modeling process.",

            "abstract": "The increase of 9‰ of the lithium isotope composition of the ocean since 60 Ma has been interpreted as reflecting a change of the silicate weathering regime with more rapid CO2 consumption due to increased tectonic uplift (Misra and Froelich, 2012). However, the small number of case studies limits our current understanding of the parameters controlling the Li isotope composition of large rivers discharging to the ocean. To characterize Li isotope fractionation at the continental scale, we report the Li isotope composition of river-borne material in the largest Earth’s River system, the Amazon River basin. The sample set includes rivers from various geomorphological settings, notably rivers draining the Andes and the lowlands. As a result of silicate weathering, the Li isotope composition (δ7Li ) of the dissolved load is fractionated toward heavy values (from +1.2 to +32‰) compared to the upper continental crust (0 - 2‰) and the suspended sediments (-6.8 to -0.5‰). We show that despite having very contrasted weathering and erosion regimes, both Andean headwaters and lowland rivers share a similar range of Li isotope composition (+1.2 up to +18‰). The correlation of the dissolved δ7Li with the Li/Na and with the Li/Mg ratios suggests that the fraction of Li incorporated in secondary minerals during weathering is the main parameter controlling the Li isotope composition at the whole Amazon basin scale. Both Rayleigh distillation and batch fractionation models satisfactorily explain the data with fractionation factors between weathering products and dissolved load ranging from 0.982 to 0.991. The fraction of Li incorporated in secondary minerals is controlled by the weathering regime and therefore is linked to the denudation rates. However, we show that Li incorporation in floodplains also influences the δ7Li of rivers at their mouth. These results have important implications for the understanding of past ocean δ7Li and stress the need to characterize at the global scale what are the parameters controlling the proportion of Li incorporated in secondary minerals.",

            "abstract": "Grain-size distributions (GSDs) in a pyroclastic fall deposit which is produced by an explosive volcanic eruption has a significant information on the eruption event. The areal distributions of GSDs indicate the eruption intensity and the wind conditions in the isopach and isopleth maps. On the other hand, stratigraphic variations of GSDs such as normal or reverse grading at given localities reflect the temporal behavior of the eruption intensity and/or in the source GSD, along with the influence of differential sedimentation. However, no quantitative modeling has been developed to relate the temporal variation of source characteristics (column height and source GSDs) to stratigraphic variation of GSDs in the deposits. In this study, we develop the mathematical model in 1D differential sedimentation process, which relates a source GSDs as functions of time to GSDs in a deposit, as functions of stratigraphic position. The number of a specific-size grains at the source position on the departure time must equal that at any position and time during settling. The Lagrangian description allows us to relate a GSD at any height and time to the source GSD through settling velocity. Using this, we can calculate the temporal change of deposit thickness and GSD in the deposit. As the first step, we understand what parameters control the thickness of fine-grained layer where the coarsest grains are depleted. Assuming a power-law GSD, we derive the thickness fraction of fine-grained layer to the whole thickness in terms of controlling parameters; a ratio of falling time to eruption duration and value of power on GSD function. By using this mathematical relationship, we estimate the value of power on source GSDs in the 2011 Shinmoedake subplinian eruption, as approximately 4, which is in the reasonable range for GSDs.",

            "abstract": "Current estimates of the magnitude of the cosmic dust input range from 2 to over 100 tons per day (t d-1), depending on whether the measurements are made in space, in the middle atmosphere, or in polar ice cores. This nearly 2 order-of-magnitude discrepancy indicates that there are flaws in perhaps both the interpretation of the experimental observations and the atmospheric models that have been used to make the estimates. This paper will describe three new estimates of the dust input, and attempt to reconcile them.\nThe first is a zodiacal dust cloud model which predicts that more than 90% of the dust entering the atmosphere comes from Jupiter Family Comets, and that the dust is mostly in a near-prograde orbit and should enter the atmosphere with an average velocity around 14 km s-1. However, relatively few of these slow particles are observed, even by the powerful Arecibo 430 MHz radar. Using coupled models of meteoroid differential ablation, ionization and radar detection to compute the probability of detecting a specified meteoroid in the Arecibo beam, an upper limit to the cosmic dust input of 16 t d-1 has been obtained from the radar obsevations.\n The second method is to use lidar measurements of the vertical Na atom flux at the Starfire Optical Range, combined with predictions of the relative geographic variations of the key wave-induced vertical transport processes from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM). The estimated global influx of cosmic dust is then 50 ± 13 t d-1.\n The final method is to model several of the mesospheric metal layers - Na, Fe, K and Ca - using WACCM with a full treatment of the gas-phase chemistry of these metals, together with the explicit formation and growth of meteoric smoke particles. The absolute densities of the metal layers can be satisfactorily modelled with a dust input of up to 25 t d-1 if the dust mass and velocity distribution is that predicted by the zodiacal dust cloud model referred to above.",

With regard to the amount of contaminants discharged at this study site, there is no exact information on disposal. Therefore, various remediation technologies such as soil vapor extraction, soil flushing, biostimulation, and pump-and-treatment have been performed to eliminate the contaminant sources of trichloroethylene (TCE) and to prevent the migration of TCE plume from remediation target zones. Also, dissolved TCE concentration and mass of residual TCE in the initial stage of disposal were estimated to evaluate the efficiency of in situ remediation. The remediation efficiency according to the remediation actions was evaluated by tracing a time-series of plume evolution and estimating the temporal mass discharge at three transects (Source, Transec-1, Transect-2) which was assigned along the groundwater flow path. From results of periodically monitored TCE concentration at main source zone, the TCE level (15.74 mg/L) before the remediation dramatically decreased up to 0.56 mg/L at the end of year 2012 due to the effect of remediation. During the intensive remediation period from 2012 to 2013, the early average mass discharge (26.58 g/day) at source transect was decreased to average 4.99 g/day. Especially, in case of surfactant flushing test which was conducted to eliminate the residual TCE, the efficiency of surfactant flushing test was evaluated using the recovery rate of chloride ion which was used as tracer. The results for recovery rate of chloride ion show that test wells observed the slow recovery rate represented more effective dissolution of TCE than wells showing the rapid recovery rate. By using the source zone monitoring data and analytical solution, initial dissolved concentration and residual mass of TCE in late 1980s at the main source zone were roughly estimated 150 mg/L and 1000 kg, respectively. These values decreased to 0.45 mg/L and 33.07 kg direct after an intensive remedial action in 2013 and then it expected to be continuously decreased to 0.29 mg/L and 25.41 kg from the end of remedial actions to 2020.",

However, the force-free state only describes the magnetic field topology but not the plasma motion of a MC. For a MC propagating in interplanetary space, the global plasma motion has three possible components: linear propagating motion of a MC away from the Sun, expanding motion and circular motion with respect to the axis of the MC. By assuming the quasi-steady evolution and self-similar expansion, we introduced the three-component motion into the cylindrical force-free flux rope model, and developed a velocity-modified model. Then we applied the model to 73 MCs observed by Wind spacecraft to investigate the properties of the plasma motion of MCs. It is found that (1) some MCs did not propagate along the Sun-Earth line, suggesting the direct evidence of the CME's deflected propagation and/or rotation in interplanetary space, (2) the expansion speed is correlated with the radial propagation speed and 62%/17% of MCs underwent a under/over-expansion at 1 AU, and (3) the circular motion does exists though it is only on the order of 10 km s-1. These findings advance our understanding of the MC's properties at 1 AU as well as the dynamic evolution of CMEs from the Sun to interplanetary space.",

            "abstract": "The vast majority of phenological studies address questions relative to the spatial or temporal variability of phenological timings integrated at the forest stand (i.e. tree population) scale. Within a forest stand, the inter-individual variability of phenological timings is expected to affect a range of tree functions among which the access to light, the use of carbon and nitrogen reserves, the absorption of minerals and the sensitivity to pathogens. Hence the individual’s phenological traits are likely to be strongly selected, resulting in an adaptation of the population to local conditions, as evidenced by latitudinal and altitudinal clines observed in common garden experiments. Studies dedicated to the within-stand variability of the timing of phenophases have to date been mostly designed for contrasting the behaviours of understory versus overstory species or seedlings compared to their adult conspecifics. The few published papers studying the phenological timings among adult conspecifics revealed unclear patterns. We aimed at clarifying the understanding of the within-stand variability of tree phenology of three of the main European deciduous species (Quercus petraea, Quercus robur and Fagus sylvatica) through the analysis of a unique phenological database collected over 44 (28 Oak sites, 16 Beech stands) forest stands at the tree level for 4 years over France.\nWe show that within a forest stand, individual trees have a distinct “phenological identity” resulting in a year to year conservation of (a) the individuals’ spring and autumn phenological rankings and (b) the individuals’ critical temperature sums required for budburst and senescence. The individual’s spring “phenological identity” affects its functioning and, ultimately, its competitive ability: big trees burst earlier. Acknowledging that Angiosperms show low genetic diversity between populations, we show that the between-site variability of critical temperature sums needed for budburst or senescence is low. We show that this between-site variability is linked to climate and geographical gradients, which suggest local adaptations of the populations’ phenological traits.",

            "abstract": "The need for knowledge on gas hydrate “host” and “guest” interactions with reservoir rocks comes from the two folded exploitation of gas hydrates. On one hand natural gas hydrates represent an immense energy source, on the other hand carbon sequestration in the form of CO2 hydrates represents a long-term storage of carbon dioxide. Whether one’s goal is to extract methane from natural gas hydrates or store carbon dioxide in the form of hydrates, it requires an understanding of the complex phenomena involving coupled dynamics of hydrates and hydrate stability in porous media. Hydrates can never attach directly to solid mineral surfaces because of the incompatibility of charges between the mineral surfaces and the hydrates. However, adsorption of water and carbon dioxide on mineral surfaces may favor heterogeneous nucleation of hydrate in the immediate vicinity. Different surfaces have their own specific adsorption preferences and corresponding adsorption thermodynamics. We have selected calcite, a common mineral found in porous media. Using molecular dynamics we have initially focused on the water interface in order to evaluate the \"host\" interactions towards the surface. We also aimed at evaluating the model before including guest molecules.",

            "abstract": "At fast-spreading mid-ocean ridges the axial melt lenses sandwiched between the lower oceanic crust and the sheeted dike sequences are assumed to be the major magma source of oceanic crust accretion. According to the widely discussed “gabbro glacier” model, the formation of the lower oceanic crust requires efficient cooling of the axial melt lens, resulting in partly crystallization and leading to crystal-melt mush which may subside down to form the lower crust. These processes are believed to be controlled dominantly by periodical magma supply and hydrothermal circulation above melt lens. Here we quantify the cooling rate above melt lens using chemical zoning of plagioclase from hornfelsic recrystallized sheeted dikes overlying the uppermost gabbros, which are part of the dike-gabbro transition zone drilled in Hole 1256D in the Eastern equatorial Pacific by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program, where for the first time the dike-gabbro transition zone of an intact oceanic crust was penetrated and sampled. The measured zoning patterns are supposed to be a combined result of diffusion during both on-ridge and off-ridge cooling. We estimate the on-ridge cooling rate using a forward modelling approach based on CaAl-NaSi interdiffusion in plagioclase. The results show that the recrystallized sheeted dikes have been cooled from the peak thermal overprint at 1000-1050 °C to 600 °C within about 5-30 years as a result of hydrothermal circulation above a melt lens during a period of magma starvation, corresponding to a cooling rate of 30±15 °C/yr. Heat balance calculation also approves that in order to balance the heat output of a melt lens at a fast-spreading mid-ocean ridge similar to the case of IODP Hole 1256D, the cooling rate above the melt lens is required to be around 30 °C/yr. The estimated rapid hydrothermal cooling rate coincides with the observed annual to decal episodes of melt lens fluctuation and lava eruption, which favors the “gabbro glacier” model and explains how the effective heat extraction from melt lens is achieved at fast-spreading mid-ocean ridges.",

            "abstract": "Sea surface temperature (SST) changes during the Eocene-Oligocene climate transition were characterized by substantial cooling at high latitudes and less cooling in low latitudes, with little information from mid-latitudes so far. Taking advantage of the newly retrieved drift sediments from the IODP 342 Expedition, we aim to reconstruct SST changes at the mid-latitude Newfoundland region, at an unprecedented orbital resolution from Site U1411. During the period investigated, 32-36 Ma, the alkenone UK’37 values range from 0.65 to 0.95, with values all greater than 0.80 before the transition and lower values (<0.80) occurring approximately at the eccentricity minimum nodes after the transition. No immediate cooling associated with Oi-1 glaciation was observed. During the Oligocene, SSTs during warm epochs (corresponding to eccentricity maxima) were not significantly cooler than before. Overall, SST fluctuations appear to be modulated by orbital changes throughout the record, although more apparent due to larger amplitude of SST variability after the transition. We thus hypothesize that the mid-latitude Newfoundland region was largely bathed by low-latitude warm waters during the transition and that polar waters (fronts) reached to the region occasionally at periods of eccentricity minimum nodes during the Oligocene.",

            "abstract": "The 11 March 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake of Mw=9.0 brought a wide spread aftershocks in northern Honshu island, Japan. Either static Coulomb stress, dynamic stress, pore fluid pressure change or a combination of them takes a responsibility for the occurrence of the off-fault aftershocks. In contrast, seismicity decrease after the Tohoku-oki is extremely limited to several regions, the vicinity of the 2011 hypocenter and aftershock zones of a few preceding large inland earthquakes. Such pre-Tohoku-oki high seismicity and/or post-Tohoku-oki longer observation would be needed to detect significance of seismic quiescence. We now focus on the other requirement, sensitivity to local-scale receiver fault mechanism, to see if hidden faults were indeed brought farther from failure by the Tohoku-oki mainshock.\nHere we demonstrate how much local fault structure affects the observed aftershock shut down of the 14 June 2008 Iwate-Miyagi inland earthquake (Mw=6.6) after the Tohoku-oki. To perform the detail investigation, we use determined 3668 focal mechanisms (Yoshida et al., 2013) of the Iwate-Miyagi aftershocks occurred until 10 March 2011, as a proxy for hidden active faults. We then compute Coulomb stress change (ΔCFF) on all nodal planes using a coseismic slip model of the Tohoku-oki (Iinuma et al., 2012) in an elastic half-space with a wide range of apparent friction coefficient μ’ of 0.0, 0.4 and 0.8. 80% and 50% of the resolved ΔCFF on all the planes are negative under μ’=0.0 and 0.8, respectively. In contrast, positive ΔCFF are obtained mostly from strike-slip nodal planes occupied in the western 2008 rupture zone. Post-Tohoku-oki seismicity was active in the area while most of the 2008 aftershock zone occupied by reverse faults was in relative quiescence.\nTo explain overall time-dependent behavior of the observed 2008 aftershock shut down due to the Tohoku-oki, we next employ rate- and state-dependent friction law of Dieterich (1994). A group of the calculated ΔCFF values on all nodal planes is used to simulate the 2008 aftershock response to the 2011 Tohoku-oki stress perturbation following the Monte Carlo method of Toda et al. (2012). Despite a fraction of resolved stress increase onto strike-slip faults, rate/state model well reproduces the rate decrease under the lower μ’ that may imply weak faults.",

            "abstract": "It is taken for granted that the limited predictability in the initial value problem, the weather prediction, and the predictability of the statistics are two distinct problems. Lorenz (1975) dubbed this predictability of the first and the second kind respectively. Predictability of the first kind in a chaotic dynamical system is limited due to the well-known critical dependence on initial conditions. Predictability of the second kind is possible in an ergodic system, where either the dynamics is known and the phase space attractor can be characterized by simulation or the system can be observed for such long times that the statistics can be obtained from temporal averaging, assuming that the attractor does not change in time.\nThe non-linear nature of the problem furthermore opens the possibility of multiple attractors, or multiple quasi-steady states. As the paleoclimatic record shows, the climate has been jumping between different quasi-stationary climates. Such a jump happens very fast when a critical tipping point has been reached. The question is: Can a tipping point be predicted? This is a new kind of predictability (the third kind). If the tipping point is reached through a bifurcation, where the stability of the system is governed by some control parameter, changing in a predictable way to a critical value, the tipping is predictable. If the sudden jump occurs because internal chaotic fluctuations, noise, push the system across a barrier, the tipping is as unpredictable as the triggering noise. In order to hint at an answer to this question, an analysis of the Dansgaard-Oeschger climate events observed in ice core records is presented. The result of the analysis points to a fundamental limitation in predictability of the third kind.",

            "abstract": "The subsurface dynamics of magma in mush columns beneath arc volcanoes is recorded in the textures of the basic lavas. A detailed comparison of lava textures from large mature volcanoes in Indonesia (Merapi) and the Aleutian Islands (Adak and Atka), shows remarkably similar, often indistinguishable, textures of high alumina basalts (HAB) and basaltic andesites (BA). We suggest a systematic characterization of these distinctive textures into a few simple categories reflecting the subsurface history of crystallization within solidification fronts (SFs) and subsequent transport dynamics. The HABs are strongly plagioclase-phyric and of two main groups: A1 consists of large, idiomorphic, mildly zoned, plagioclase (20-30 vol.%) with small amounts of olivine (2-8%) set in a finely crystalline groundmass of these same phases; A2 is similar, but contains an additional pervasive population of large ‘old’ plagioclase, rounded, often highly zoned, and sometimes broken; A1+ is a subclass of A1 where traces of ‘old’ plagioclase are present. Similar categories exist in the BA lavas except overall crystallinity is higher and olivine is replaced by large clinopyroxenes containing or mantled with magnetite. In a temporal stratigraphic sense, the early lavas are generally HAB A1 types and transition into, sometimes alternating, HAB A2 types followed by BA types. The initial establishment of the mush column is by hot, highly mobile primary magmas, followed by increasingly more thermally mature magmas containing debris from disrupted SFs. The detailed nature of this debris, its variation in time, and the volumes give important insights on the size and vigor of the mush column staging chambers.",

            "abstract": "Although global climate and forecast models have improved their representation of the diurnal phase of convection, biases remain—especially in the tropics and over land. For example, many models experience precipitation peaks in phase with surface buoyancy fluxes, instead of several hours later as observed. The extent of the consequences of these convection phase errors is not well understood, as the processes involved interact in a nonlinear way. Moreover, convection is crucial for maintaining the thermal and moisture profile of the tropical atmosphere; therefore, it is important not only to further improve the representation of convection in models, but also to fundamentally understand the mechanisms that exert control on the diurnal phase of convection.\nControlled simulations over a wide parameter space with models of varying complexity provide a unique opportunity to further understanding of this problem. More specifically, here we use observations, reanalysis, a single-column model, a 2D model, and a new LES model in an interdependent way. Simulations are initialized and forced with diurnal radiative forcing, which closely matches observations, and are run into radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE). In these RCE simulations, we analyze the extent to which the diurnal phase can be explained in the absence of mesoscale circulations.\nSimulations that separately vary surface thermal inertia, evaporation rates, and longwave/shortwave clear-sky and cloud feedback are conducted. These simulations show that although a simple radiation scheme coupled to a surface with the correct thermal inertia may be sufficient to distinguish between tropical maritime and continental convection, nonlinear cloud-radiative feedback may be important for introducing the lag between the peaks in precipitation relative to surface buoyancy fluxes over homogeneous continental surfaces. Previously, surface heterogeneity and mesoscale convective organization have been linked to phase lags of deep convection. We show that mesoscale organization is not necessary to obtain the observed phase lags and that cloud feedbacks may play a role in delaying convection over a homogeneous continental surface.",

The arctic latitude lower thermospheric temperatures at around 120 km altitudes obtained from the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument are found to be enhanced during SSW events and show a latitudinal gradient (temperature decreasing towards low-latitudes). Commensurately, the Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere, Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) Doppler Interferometer (TIDI) measurements showed equatorward winds in the mesosphere lower thermosphere (MLT) altitudes over high latitudes during these events. Both, the high-latitude lower thermospheric temperature enhancements and the MLT region equatorward winds occur simultaneously with the observed enhancements in the OI dayglow emission intensities at all the wavelengths. From these observations and other supporting observational and modeling results it is proposed that a new cell of meridional circulation in the MLT winds is set up during SSW events, which enables transport of atomic oxygen from high-to-low latitudes. Such an additional contribution of oxygen density over low-latitudes interacts with daytime lower thermospheric dynamics and is attributed to be the cause for the observed enhancement in the oxygen daytime optical emission intensities over low-latitudes. These results will presented in the light of experimental evidence to such circulation alluded to by earlier simulation studies.",

            "abstract": "Deficiency of direct information has been the main obstacle in the subsurface characterizations, which may be supplemented by the secondary information. In the present study, a recursive subsurface prediction algorithm based primarily on direct lithological information and transient pressure changes is proposed by combining a non-parametric geostatistical model and groundwater flow simulation under Bayesian framework. The general performance of the proposed model is comparatively analyzed against that of ensemble Kalman filer (EnKF), which is one of the most popular model for predicting subsurface properties (e.g., permeability) recursively through the assimilation of transient measurements (e.g., groundwater head with time) and the corresponding physical model. For the demonstration of the proposed method, an assumed geologic map containing four different lithologies with the high categorical non-stationarity is employed and a hypothetical hydraulic conductivity map is formulated based on the lithological map. In the predictions, it is hypothesized that the information only at 45 locations are available and the rests are unknown. In the comparisons of two competing models, 48, 96 and 148 conditional realizations are generated to examine the model sensitivities to the number of the realizations. Additionally, a hypothetical pumping test was performed based on the assumed hydraulic conductivity to acquire history curves at a few observation wells. Both models commonly show gradual improvements in the prediction quality. However, the proposed model shows overall outperformance in terms of the improvement rate and the convergence, especially, in the predictability for spatial connectivity of the highly permeable structures. Besides, the predictions from the proposed model shows less sensitivity to the number of input realizations indicating computational advantages over EnKF. Therefore, it may be concluded that the predictions of the proposed model supplements those from the EnKF in various ways with relatively trivial computational burden. Due to the modularity, it is expected that the proposed model can be applied to many practical problems which have resemblance to the demonstrated one once the physical models are provided.",

            "abstract": "Autumn-sown crops act as winter cover crop, reducing soil erosion and nutrient leaching, while potentially providing higher yields than spring varieties in many environments. Nevertheless, overwintering crops are exposed for longer periods to the vagaries of weather conditions. Adverse winter conditions, in particular, may negatively affect the final yield, by reducing crop survival or its vigor. The net effect of the projected shifts in climate is unclear. On the one hand, warmer temperatures may reduce the frequency of low temperatures, thereby reducing damage risk. On the other hand, warmer temperatures, by reducing plant acclimation level and the amount and duration of snow cover, may increase the likelihood of damage. Thus, warmer climates may paradoxically result in more extensive low temperature damage and reduced viability for overwintering plants. The net effect of a shift in climate is explored by means of a parsimonious probabilistic model, based on a coupled description of air temperature, snow cover, and crop tolerable temperature. Exploiting an extensive dataset of winter wheat responses to low temperature exposure, the risk of winter damage occurrence is quantified under conditions typical of northern temperate latitudes. The full spectrum of variations expected with climate change is explored, quantifying the joint effects of alterations in temperature averages and their variability as well as shifts in precipitation. The key features affecting winter wheat vulnerability to low temperature damage under future climates are singled out.",

            "abstract": "Although different strategies have demonstrated that incorporation of expert and a priori knowledge can help to improve the realism of models, no systematic strategy has been presented in the literature for constraining the model parameters to be consistent with the (sometimes) patchy understanding of a modeler regarding how the real system might work. Part of the difficulty in doing this is that expert knowledge may not always consist of explicitly quantifiable relationships between physical system characteristics and model parameters; rather, it may consist of conceptual understanding about consistency relationships that must exist between various model parameter or behavioral relationships that must exist among model state variables and/or fluxes.\nApart from aforementioned constraints, a unified strategy for measurement of information content in hierarchal model building seems lacking. Firstly the model structure is built by its building blocks (control volumes or state variables) as well as interconnecting fluxes (formation of control volumes and fluxes). Secondly, parameterizations of model are designed, as an example the effect of a specific type of stage-discharge relation for a control volume can be explored. At the final stage the parameter values are quantified. In each step and based on assumptions made, more and more information is added to the model.\nIn this study we try to construct (based on hierarchal model building scheme) and constrain parameters of different conceptual models built on landscape units classified according to their hydrological functions and based on our logical considerations and general lessons from previous studies across the globe for a Luxembourgish catchment.\nBased on the result, including our basic understanding of how a system may work into hydrological models appears to be a powerful tool to achieve higher model realism as it leads to models with higher performance. Progressive measurement of performance and uncertainty indicates which of the structural elements, parameterization or constraints contributes significantly in capturing the system behavior. Moreover, this attempt can be seen as a platform which brings the opportunity for both modelers and experimentalists to better communicate and test their hypothesis and assumptions.",

            "abstract": "Recent realistic high resolution modeling studies show a net increase of submesoscale activity in fall and winter when the Mixed Layer Depth (hereafter MLD) is at its maximum. This submesoscale activity is associated with the shallowing of the MLD when compared to similar model configurations at lower resolution. Both phenomena can be related to the development of Mixed Layer Instabilities (MLIs), which by slumping the horizontal density gradient in the mixed layer convert Available Potential Energy into submesoscale Eddy Kinetic Energy and contribute to a fast restratification. While parameterizations of the shallowing of the mixed layer by MLIs have been proposed they are based on idealized configurations and are not yet fully tested in realistically forced simulations. In the present work, the ML formation and restratification is studied by uniformly cooling a fully turbulent zonal jet in a periodic channel at different resolutions (eddy resolving (10km) to submesoscale permitting (2km)). The effect of horizontal resolution is quantified in terms of MLD, restratification rate, buoyancy fluxes, and conversion of Available Potential Energy in Eddy Kinetic Energy. At the highest resolution when submesoscale is active the MLD formed during the surface cooling is shallower by about 30% and the total restratification almost three times faster. Such differences between low and high resolution models are explained by the submesoscale vertical buoyancy flux which compensates the convection during the formation phase and accelerates the restratification once the surface cooling stops. These findings are robust and the uncertainties are quantified by ensemble experiments. The most common parameterization of MLIs has been implemented and tested in our coarse resolution configuration, leading as expected to a slightly faster restratification, but the shallowing of the MLD is not represented, suggesting a caveat in such parameterization in presence of strong convection.",

            "abstract": "Europe loses approximately half a million hectares of forest to human-caused fires annually. High population densities and fuel loads in areas of forest recovery aid uncontrolled wildfires, despite decreasing use of fire in agriculture. In rural areas such as the Mediterranean, pervasive wildfires can be indicative of socio-economic decline and themselves cause political tension.\nSince the 2000s, the European Forest Fires Information System maps forest fires in Europe daily, as part of a modular system that also assesses fire risk. This system, developed and maintained by the European Commission, feeds pan-European information to forest fire and civil protection agencies in the EU and provides a consistent quality-checked forest fire record for scientific analysis and global reporting initiatives. The current fire mapping algorithm captures fires larger than 50 ha, owing to its reliance on MODIS imagery. As a result, the system misses about 95% of Europe’s forest fires, which contribute 20-25% of the annually burned area, because they are too small for detection.\nWe present a new approach to fire mapping that relies on multiple satellite sensors to improve spatiotemporal detail of mapped fire activity. We implemented the approach to map European wildfires exploiting the 30 m spatial resolution of the Landsat 8 sensor, and the daily overpass of the MODIS sensors. By doing so, detections of smaller fires improved dramatically, although they were somewhat delayed. The algorithm relies on a set of heuristic rules that translate knowledge of the temporal dynamics of fire disturbance, recovery, and confounding factors such as agricultural harvest, into spectro-temporal criteria. By design, it can be adapted to areas with different fire regimes, and ingest information from additional satellite sensors to further improve detection rates and times. We discuss the latter in the context of the Sentinel missions, and their potential contribution to global wildfire monitoring.",

            "abstract": "It is widely accepted that the Earth experienced several large impacts during its early evolution which led to the formation of one or more magma oceans. Differentiation processes in such a magma ocean are of great importance for the initial conditions of mantle convection and for the subsequent mantle structure. Convection in a magma ocean is most likely very vigorous. Further, rotation of the early Earth is supposed to be very fast. Therefore, and due to the small viscosity, it can be assumed that differentiation is strongly affected by rotation.\nTo study the influence of rotation on the crystallization of a magma ocean, we employed a 3D Cartesian numerical model with low Prandtl number and used a discrete element method to describe silicate crystals.\nOur results show a crucial dependence on crystal density, rotation rate and latitude. Low rotation at the pole leads to a large fraction of suspended particles. With increasing rotation the particles settle at the bottom and form a stable stratified layer. In contrast to that at the equator at low rotation all particles settle at the bottom, at higher rotation they form a layer of significant thickness and at the highest rotation rate the particles accumulate in the middle of the magma ocean. In addition to that, we observe that due to the Coriolis force silicate crystals with different densities separate from each other. While lighter particles are at the bottom, denser particles accumulate at mid-depth at the same rotation rate. This could result in an unstable stratified mantle in the equatorial region after magma ocean solidification.\nAll in all, rotation could lead to an asymmetrical crystallization of the magma ocean, with a contrary layering at the pole and the equator. This affects the composition of the early mantle and could explain the development of a localized magma ocean at the core-mantle boundary and the development of phase transitions observed in seismology, like the mantle transition zone.",

            "abstract": "Current satellite observations of tropospheric composition made from low Earth orbit provide at best one or two measurements each day at any given location. Coverage is global but sparse, often with large uncertainties in individual measurements that limit examination of local and regional atmospheric composition over short time periods. This has hindered the operational uptake of these data for monitoring air quality and population exposure, and for initializing and evaluating chemical weather forecasts. By the end of the current decade there are planned geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) satellite missions for atmospheric composition over North America, East Asia and Europe with additional missions proposed. Together, these present the possibility of a constellation of GEO platforms to achieve continuous time-resolved high-density observations of continental domains for mapping pollutant sources and variability on diurnal and local scales. We describe Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) to evaluate the contributions of these GEO missions to improve knowledge of near-surface air pollution due to intercontinental long-range transport and quantify chemical precursor emissions. We discuss the requirements on measurement simulation, chemical transport modeling, and data assimilation for a successful OSSE infrastructure. Our approach uses an efficient computational method to sample a high-resolution global GEOS-5 chemistry Nature Run over each geographical region of the GEO constellation. The demonstration carbon monoxide (CO) observation simulator, which is being expanded to other chemical pollutants, currently produces multispectral retrievals and captures realistic scene-dependent variation in measurement vertical sensitivity and cloud cover. We use the DART Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter to assimilate the simulated observations in a CAM-Chem global chemistry-climate model Control Run. The impact of observing over each region is evaluated using data denial experiments. Finally, we report on international collaborations using the OSSE approach to determine expected performance of planned satellite systems and set requirements for future missions.",

            "abstract": "Mean sea level rise receives ample attention in the literature. However, peak water levels, which are most important for flood vulnerability and salinity intrusion in tidal river networks, may not be linearly related with mean surface levels. To quantify tidal and subtidal water level changes and to link these changes to human intervention, 70 years of water level data for the Rhine–Meuse tidal river network is analysed using a variety of statistical methods. Using a novel parameterization of probability density functions, mean high and low water levels are examined, and extreme water levels are investigated by applying the combined Mann–Kendall and Pettitt tests to find trends and trend changes. Tidal water levels are studied based on harmonic analysis. Results show that the mean water levels throughout the system rise with the same pace as the mean sea level. However, high and low water levels do not show the same increase, and the spatial variability in decadal trends in high- and low water levels is high. High water and low water extremes generally decrease. Both the extreme water level analysis and the harmonic analysis display significant trend breaks in 1970, 1981 and 1997. These breaks can be attributed to the closure of the Haringvliet estuary, the removal of sluices and the removal of a dam, respectively, which radically alter the tidal motion. These results demonstrate that the direct human influence on the tidal motion can overwhelm the effect of mean sea level rise on water level extremes.",

The aftershock sequence was recorded during a quiet interval in the mine and thus enabled us to perform the analysis using Dietrich’s (1994) rate and state dependent friction law. The formulation for earthquake productivity requires estimation of Coulomb stress changes due to the mainshock, the reference seismicity rate, frictional resistance parameter, and the duration of aftershock relaxation time. We divided the area into six depth intervals and for each we estimated the parameters and modeled the spatio-temporal patterns of seismicity rates after the stress perturbation. Comparing the modeled patterns of seismicity with the observed distribution we found that while the spatial patterns match well, the rate of modeled aftershocks is lower than the observed rate. To test our model, we used four metrics of the goodness-of-fit evaluation. Testing procedure allowed rejecting the null hypothesis of no significant difference between seismicity rates only for one depth interval containing the mainshock, for the other, no significant differences have been found. Results show that mining-induced earthquakes may be followed by a stress relaxation expressed through aftershocks located on the rupture plane and in regions of positive Coulomb stress change. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the main features of the temporal and spatial distribution of very small, mining-induced earthquakes at shallow depths can be successfully determined using rate- and state-based stress modeling.",

            "abstract": "Integrated groundwater-land surface models characterize catchment responses by coupling the subsurface flow with land surface processes. One of the uncertainties of these models is the specification of the initial condition and its influence on progressive simulations. The key challenge is that initializations often require spatially distributed information on model states, groundwater levels and soil moisture, which is often unavailable. One approach to reduce uncertainty in model initialization is to run the model recursively using a single or multiple years of forcing data until the system equilibrates with respect to state and diagnostic variables (spin-up process). Here, we performed a multiple criteria analysis using different spin-up measures and thresholds to define equilibrium state in an integrated groundwater-land surface model, ParFlow.CLM, and evaluated model performance as a function of various spin-up criteria. The ParFlow.CLM model was developed over a 208 km2 catchment in Denmark with a temperate climate. Results illustrated that equilibrium of subsurface storages required 20 years of spin-up simulations which was computationally intensive (26 days of computation using 32 processors). In the next stage, we assessed sensitivity of surface water-groundwater exchanges to initializations obtained from multiple equilibrium states through recursive simulations. Our results indicated sensitivity in modeled recharge and stream flow to the different equilibrium initializations, but reduced sensitivity in modeled energy fluxes to the same changes. Due to computational cost of spin-up for model initialization, new methodologies are needed for reducing computation time of spin-up approaches.",

            "abstract": "One fundamental aspect of seismic hazard mitigation is gaining a better understanding of the rupture process. Because direct observation of the relevant parameters and properties is not possible, other means such as kinematic source inversions are used instead. By constraining the spatial and temporal evolution of fault slip during an earthquake, those inversion approaches may enable valuable insights in the physics of the rupture process. However, due to the underdetermined nature of this inversion problem (i.e., inverting a kinematic source model for an extended fault based on seismic data), the provided solutions are generally non-unique.\nHere we present a statistical (Bayesian) inversion approach based on an open-source library for uncertainty quantification (UQ) called QUESO that was developed at ICES (UT Austin). The approach has advantages with respect to deterministic inversion approaches as it provides not only a single (non-unique) solution but also provides uncertainty bounds with it. Those uncertainty bounds help to qualitatively and quantitatively judge how well constrained an inversion solution is and how much rupture complexity the data reliably resolve. The presented inversion scheme uses only tele-seismically recorded body waves but future developments may lead us towards joint inversion schemes.\nAfter giving an insight in the inversion scheme ifself (based on delayed rejection adaptive metropolis, DRAM) we explore the method’s resolution potential. For that, we synthetically generate tele-seismic data, add for example different levels of noise and/or change fault plane parameterization and then apply our inversion scheme in the attempt to extract the (known) kinematic rupture model. We conclude with exemplary inverting real tele-seismic data of a recent large earthquake and compare those results with deterministically derived kinematic source models provided by other research groups.",

We use seismic data recorded on permanent broadband stations on Spitsbergen, the main island of the Svalbard Archipelago, as well as data from a local, temporary seismic network in northwestern Spitsbergen to detect, locate and analyze glacier seismicity. We observe a high number of icequakes related to glacier calving with characteristic seasonality and signal frequency spectrum. We calibrate regionally observed calving events by using the local records and direct visual observations of calving at Kongsfjord, northwestern Spitsbergen. We analyze the temporal distribution of calving seismicity within the past decade with special focus on Kronebreen, a fast-flowing tidewater glacier at Kongsfjord that shows a recent accelerating retreat.\nWe also observe a cluster of seismic events emitted by a catastrophic glacier surge in southern Spitsbergen. The Nathorstbreen glacier system went through a surge phase between 2008 and 2013. In early 2009, a high number of seismic events are observed during the initial surge phase of Zawadskibreen, one of the branches of the system. Observable seismicity is absent during the progression of the surge after May 2009. We discuss different source mechanisms for these events, i.e. bed-failure at the glacier tongue and ice faulting. Remote sensing observations show fault-like structures within the ice along the margin of Zawadskibreen, where the ice is ripped apart on the margins. These structures have a much larger extent than normal glacier crevasses and their generation during the initial phase of the surge may be the source of seismic evens. We also observe another, but indirect indicator for glacier surging in Svalbard: there is a dramatic increase in number of seismic calving events during surges of Tunabreen (2003) and Wahlenbergbreen (2011) compared to melt seasons in other years.",

Being different from common river terraces usually developed on two sides of river channel, the Chihshang terrace group is located on the toe area of the large alluvial fan of east-flowing Xinwulyu River, which derived from the Central Range and crosses the 5-7-km-wide Longitudinal Valley to reach the Coastal Rang and has been cut through by the west-thrusting Chihshang Fault.\nThe 5-m DEM morphology analyses results show the Chihshang terrace group can be divided into ten levels of various height differences. The spatial distribution of terraces is uneven: higher levels (T5 to T10, >34 m high) and lower levels (T1 and T2, <23 m high) distribute on the northern part of alluvial fan, medium levels (T3 and T4, around 25-32 m high) on the middle part, and no terraces can be found on the southern part. Field investigations and the observations from six trenches on terraces surface show that the compositing units of terraces from top to bottom are: the Coastal Range colluviums deposits from local hills or tributaries, the Central Range deposits from Xinwulyu River channel deposits, and the bedrock. Based on these results it appears that the Chihshang terrace group was formed under influence of the continuous thrusting movement of the Chihshang Fault and the episodic lateral erosion and sedimentation of Xinwulyu River on to the hanging wall area. The uneven geographic distribution of terraces reveals the channel migration history of the Xinwulyu River.\n14C dating result of the Coastal Range deposits in a high level terrace (T7, around 30 m high from the footwall) is 5,750-6,880 cal yr B.P. Combine with previous reported data (290-490 cal yr B.P. of lowest level terrace) it reveals that the Xinwulyu River flowed to the north at least seven thousand years ago, and changed its flowing direction to the south in few hundred years ago. Together with the sedimentation rate of the footwall (1.0-1.2 cm/yr) the estimated maximum long-term vertical rate of faulting for the past seven thousand years is 1.4-1.7 cm/yr, which is a factor of two lower than the present geodetic data (2.5-3.0 cm/yr).",

Recent observed assessments have highlighted coherent long-term temperature and salinity changes that appear consistent with CMIP multi-model mean assessments, however there are discrepancies in the absolute magnitude of these observed and simulated changes. In this study, we use global climate models (from the CMIP5 and CMIP3 model suites) and a number of available observational analyses to investigate the global and regional distribution of temperature and salinity changes in neutral density space. Unlike the classical fixed-depth diagnostics, isopycnal analysis provides a lagrangian view of ocean property changes that can be directly related to surface fluxes and upper ocean water mass transformation, while essentially ignoring isopycnal heave. The comparison of pre-industrial and historical (1860-2005) simulations allows us to precisely describe where the heat and salt is stored as a result of modified forcing, leveraging off a large suite of similarly forced simulations. We also evaluate the modeled global and regional isopycnal climatologies against recent (ARGO) observations with better spatio-temporal coverage, to investigate model performance.",

The development of a new seismo-mechanical workflow permits an estimation of the long-term storage integrity.\nThe study target in the Otway Basin in south-western Victoria is Australia´s first demonstration of the deep geological storage of CO2, operated by the CO2CRC. Our objective is to predict and quantify the distribution and the amount of sub-/seismic strain caused by fault movement in the proximity of the reservoir. For this purpose, we applied three independent approaches to fill the sub-seismic space, and validated them.\nFirstly, we built a geometrical kinematic 3-D depth model based on 2-D and 3-D seismic data that are provided by the CO2CRC Consortium. This interpretation was stabilized by additional seismic attribute processing that images small-scale lineaments with high resolution by multi-attribute displays that combine curvature and coherency. Retro-deformation, i.e. kinematically restoring the strata in 3-D, was performed on the reservoir seal. The highest strain magnitudes are around 4-5%. They are not observed where the fault displacements are highest, but where the fault morphologies were the most complex, i.e., there are rapid changes in displacement along the fault plane. Benchmarking this approach by numerical forward modelling yields further constraints on stress variation. In areas where we had preliminary predicted critical deformation we carried out new reflection seismic measurements to calibrate our predictions. This not only yields high-resolution structural images, but, in addition, also allows to determine petrophysical parameters by the acquisition of shear-wave reflection seismic data.\nWith this seismo-mechanical workflow we obtain a better overview of possible fluid migration pathways and communication between reservoir and overburden. As such we will provide a tool for prediction and adapted time-dependent monitoring strategies for subsurface storage in general.",

Despite of this, objective and quantitative frameworks for the evaluation of uncertainties in snow measurements have been lacking. Here, we present a theoretical framework for quantitative evaluations of the uncertainty of point measurements of snow depth when used to represent the average depth over a profile section or an area. We define the error as the expected value of the squared difference between the real mean of the profile/field and the sample mean from a limited number of measurements. The model is tested for one and two dimensional survey designs that range from a single measurement to an increasing number of regularly-spaced measurements. Using high-resolution (~ 1m) LIDAR snow depths at three locations in Colorado, we show that the sample errors follow the theoretical behavior. Furthermore, we show how the determination of the spatial location of the measurements can be reduced to an optimization problem for the case of a predefined number of measurements, or to the designation of an acceptable uncertainty level to determine the total number of regularly-spaced measurements required to achieve such error. On this basis, a series of figures are presented that can be used to aid in the determination of the survey design under the conditions described, and under the assumption of prior knowledge of the spatial covariance/correlation properties. With this methodology, better objective survey designs can be accomplished, tailored to the specific applications for which the measurements are going to be used. Although we discuss the proposed methodology in the context of snow depth, the theoretical framework can be extended to other spatially distributed snow variables (e.g., SWE and/or snow depth) or hydrologic variables (e.g., soil moisture) whose statistical properties can be compared to those of snow depth. Applications of the methodology will be discussed, such as the selection of the location of snow/meteorological stations in mountain environments or survey design to be able to capture watershed scale means.",

We employ a detailed spatially resolved weathering model driven by two ensemble Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) projections of 21st Century climate (RCP8.5 and RCP4.5) to assess enhanced weathering and examine feedbacks on atmospheric CO2 and ocean carbonate biogeochemistry. Atmospheric CO2 reduction of ~100-260 ppm by year 2100, the range depending mainly on rock composition, is obtained by spreading 5 kg m-2 yr-1 over 20 Mkm2 tropical weathering ‘hotspots’. Ocean acidification is neutralized in RCP4.5 and ameliorated in RCP8.5 due to enhanced land-ocean export of weathered alkalinity products and reduced CO2 forcings, and the aragonite saturation state of surface oceans is raised to >3.5, thus avoiding likely extinction of coral reef ecosystems. We suggest that accelerated weathering has substantial potential to help limit global warming and benefits to marine life not obtained from other CDR approaches, but major issues of cost, social acceptability, and potential unanticipated consequences should encourage urgent efforts to phase down fossil fuel emissions.",

            "abstract": "Bayesian inference is increasingly being used to constrain model parameters of nonlinear geophysical problems from geodetic data. The main advantage of using Bayesian estimation is that it provides information about the full posterior probability distribution function (PDF) of the model parameters, while deterministic optimization only gives the best-fitting set of model parameters. By using Bayesian inference, however, we commonly face computational challenges of adequately sampling the model parameter posterior PDF.\nTo estimate model parameter uncertainties in deterministic optimizations, we have used a scheme of repeated estimations with slightly modified input data. The procedure includes producing a large number N of data error realizations, based on the estimated data covariance matrix, and then adding each error realization to the input data to make N modified sets of input data. We then use each of these modified input datasets to find the best-fitting model parameters, resulting in N sets of model parameters. The distribution of the model parameters has then been taken as a proxy for the posterior PDF of the model parameters. This procedure has been called “Randomize-then-optimize” or RTO and has the advantage that it is easy to implement.\nIn this presentation, we compare Bayesian inference and deterministic optimization with RTO for typical examples of determining fault model parameters for moderately sized earthquakes and for estimating interseismic model parameters from InSAR and GPS data. We show that the model parameter PDFs estimated using the two methods appear to be the same, a result which also seems to hold when data covariance matrices exhibit significant correlations (i.e. significant off-diagonal elements) and/or do not obey Gaussian statistics. Our results demonstrate the equivalence of these two different methods and that they can be used interchangeably in geophysical model parameter estimations.",

            "abstract": "We have done an attempt to reveal the major features of the thermal pattern in the Fyllingsdalen, the Ullrigg and the Årvollskogen boreholes, which are located near Bergen, Stavanger and Moss, respectively. Based on 2D gravity and magnetic modelling, the 2D structural models have been constructed for the Bergen, Stavanger and Moss areas. All available shallow and deep structural data have been used to constrain these models. The constructed 2D models were used as a structural base during the 2D thermal modelling.\nThe results of the 2D thermal modelling indicate that a significant decrease of the Earth's surface temperatures during the two last glaciations still affects the subsurface thermal field of the study areas in terms of the reduced temperatures within the uppermost crystalline crust. Besides, the advective cooling due to groundwater flow is an additional factor for the reduction of temperatures within the Bergen and Stavanger areas where the normal annual precipitation is one of the highest in Europe, reaching roughly 4000 mm/year. On the other hand, the influence of the groundwater flow on subsurface temperatures is not clearly recognizable in the Moss area.\nThe modelled temperatures are higher in the Fyllingsdalen and Årvollskogen boreholes compared to the Ullrigg borehole. This difference is in agreement with the low measured thermal gradient in the Ullrigg borehole which is less than 13.0 °C/km compared to 16.5 °C/km in the case of the Fyllingsdalen borehole and 19.3 °C/km in the Årvollskogen borehole. The differentiation in radiogenic heat production of the crystalline crust is one of the main reasons for the higher measured and modelled temperatures within the Bergen and Moss areas. This resulted in a higher heat flux in the Fyllingsdalen and the Årvollskogen boreholes in comparison with the Ullrigg borehole.",

            "abstract": "The Earth constantly losses matter through ions escaping from the polar ionosphere. This makes the ionosphere as an important source of plasma for the magnetosphere and could modulate atmospheric isotope abundances on geological timescales, depending on what fraction of the upflowing ions subsequently return to the ionosphere and what fraction are ejected into interplanetary space. It has been proposed that the magnetosphere is dynamically modulated by the presence of the ionospheric ions, particularly heavy ions O+, during magnetic substorms and storms. The origin and formation mechanism of ionospheric ion upflow is, however, poorly understood, particularly under disturbed space weather conditions. We report simultaneous direct observations of ion upflow and a patch of ionization at the center of the polar cap region during a geomagnetic storm. Our observations indicate enhanced fluxes of upwelling O+ ions originate from the patch and were accelerated by the enhanced ambipolar electric field. This enhancement is caused by soft electron precipitations. Polar cap patches therefore provide an important source of upwelling ions for accelerations mechanisms at greater altitudes which can eject the ions. These observations give new insight into the processes of ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling and the potential loss of terrestrial water dissociation products into space which, although extremely slow in the case of Earth, may be significant for other planets and moons.",

            "abstract": "Artisanal gold mining in Guyana is mostly done in forest covered areas, causing forest loss and land degradation. Data from the Guyana Geology and Mining commission show there has been an increase of 2074% between 1986 and 2009. Our analysis of Landsat data between 1986 and 2013 for a part of the Upper Mazaruni area shows an increase from 34.2 to 278.4 hectares, which amounts to more than 800%. While the frequent coverage of Landsat data is useful for multitemporal studies, the lower resolution may not be adequate for accurate detection of mining sites. Therefore, RapidEye imagery from 2011 at a resolution of 5m was used to detect gold mining activity and to compare the results with the Landsat study. Processing was conducted in eCognition, an object-based image analysis (OBIA) software. OBIA is an image processing technique that has proven to be advantageous over traditional pixel based image processing techniques, with the primary advantage being the ability of the approach in combining both the spatial and spectral information. The satellite image was subjected to segmentation at multiple scales and classified using fuzzy sets of membership functions. Classification explicitly incorporated the different scales in order to accommodate different sizes of real-world objects and spatial relationships were utilized to establish connections between related objects. For example the presence or absence of water in pits, or the existence of sediments in the river may serve as additional indicators of mining sites besides the spectral components. Preliminary results show that OBIA approach was able to successfully detect and quantify small scale mining activities in the basin, and that the Landsat data were giving an acceptable estimate of mining sites over time.\n Keywords:\nObject Based Image Analysis, Gold Mining, Remote Sensing, Guyana",

With an\nautomated inter-station method, we have obtained highly consistent, high quality, very broad band\n(10 s ->200 s), phase velocity measurements for both Love and Rayleigh waves. We performed\nmore than 8 million cross correlations to obtain around 1.5 million individual phase velocity\nmeasurements. Path-wise averaging resulted in more than 22,000 average dispersion curves for\ndifferent inter-station paths, with an average standard deviation of less than 1.5%. These average\nphase velocity dispersion curves are then used to obtain Love and Rayleigh wave phase velocity\nmaps.\nWe carried out number of resolutions tests to check the reliability of the isotropic and anisotropic\ncomponents of the maps. A quasi checkerboard test shows the areas of the best sampling, while the\nreliability of azimuthal anisotropy is tested using a synthetic model with fast directions at 90° to\nthose in the actual phase velocity maps. The results of the tests show that we obtain a lateral\nresolution from 100 to 200 km.\nAt shortest periods (10 s) the isotropic maps clearly image the Central European basin system\n(CEBS) extending from north German basin in the north towards the Polish basin further southeast.\nIn southern Central Europe low velocities are associated with thick sedimentary cover in the Po\nbasin and in the Pannonian basin. At these periods, there is a N-S trend of the anisotropy in the\nnorth, and E-W trend in the Alpine region in south, and in the Pannonian basin. Remarkably,\nisotropic velocities of the central European mantle lithosphere show no imprint of the Caledonian\nand Variscan sutures. In the uppermost mantle, a sharp lateral gradient at the Teisseyre-Tornquist-\nZone (TTZ) is observed as compared to a more gradual lateral transition across the Sorgenfrei-\nTornquist-Zone (STZ). We denote the shallow asthenosphere south west of the TTZ as Tornquist-\nTeisseyre-Asthenosphere (TTA), analogous to the TTZ. A pronounced high velocity anomaly in the\nwestern Alps is interpreted as subducting European lithosphere. At 200 s period, a high velocity\nanomaly beneath the Pannonian basin, may be due to a slab subducting into the Mantle Transition\nZone (MTZ).",

            "abstract": "Seafloor channel avulsion events recorded in the stratigraphic architecture of submarine fans are often identified as signals of boundary change of the associated sediment supply system. However, interpretation of such signals that are persevered in the rock record is complicated by the interplay between internal (autogenic) forcing and external (allogenic) forcing on the system which may have caused the avulsion of the channel.\nTo investigate the importance of autogenic forcing on seafloor channel evolution, novel models have been constructed which calculate the width-averaged growth of a channel levee system with progressive deposition. These models demonstrate that seafloor channel-levee systems are inherently unstable and will avulse purely subject to autogenic forcing. It is demonstrated that this instability arises as a function of geometric constraints on the cross-sectional shape of the evolving channel and its bounding levees under aggradational flow conditions. Analytical solutions to these simplified models demonstrate that change in the area of the channel is given by the comparative rate at which the bounding outer levee and channel are built up. Whilst the outer levee is built up faster than the channel, there is a relative increase in channel size – increasing the degree by which a flow is confined and thus the decreasing the likelihood of an avulsion. However, if the channel is built up faster than the outer levee the degree by which the flow is confined by the channel will decrease, and thus the likelihood of avulsion will increase. It is seen that as bounding levees become large, and thus cannot be built up as fast as the channel, the evolution of the channel is inherently limited.\nHowever, autogenic channel-levee instability likely arises over very long time periods, with the half-life of channel decay proportional to the channel-levee system size. Thus, it is expected that additional external (allogenic) forcing, such as boundary condition change on flows feeding the system, will modulate internal (autogenic) forcing. It is also apparent that the sensitivity of channel levee systems to external forcing, and thus the potential for signal preservation in the stratigraphic record, will be limited by the degree of channel evolution before the initiation of the allogenic forcing event.",

            "abstract": "In Japan, the interest in methane hydrate is increasing rapidly owing to increasing recognition of its potential as a next-generation energy resource that can replace conventional fossil fuels. To produce methane gas safely and minimize the associated environmental damage, we need to address many wide-ranging environmental issues. One such issue entails assessing seafloor stability during methane gas production. Methane hydrate binds the sand grains that make up the strata under the seafloor. It has been suggested that methane production may lead to seafloor deformation because the strata become unstable following the removal of methane hydrate. The geotechnical properties of ground have significant effects on its deformation behavior, but deep seafloors have not been thoroughly investigated yet.\nThe world’s first offshore test gas production from methane hydrate was conducted in the eastern Nankai Trough. We present geotechnical properties of the samples recovered from the gas production site; these properties were determined by means of laboratory tests. Soil index tests, consolidation tests, K0 consolidated undrained triaxial compression/extension tests and direct box shear tests were conducted for obtaining the geotechnical parameters necessary for deep seafloor stability analysis. The strength parameters corresponding to peak and residual states were determined by the reversal direct box shear tests.\nThis study is supported by the Research Consortium for Methane Hydrate Resources in Japan.

            "abstract": "The Al Hoceima region of Northern Morocco is located within the east-west trending imbricated thrust-and-fold system of the Rif Mountain range that results from collision between the African and Eurasian plates. The transpressive tectonics and existence of a complex fault with thrust, normal and strike-slip faulting in the Rif probably reflect the rapidly changing local tectonic regime with block rotations during the Neogene and Quaternary (Meghraoui et al., 1996). The Al Hoceima earthquakes of the May 26, 1994 (Mw=6.0) and February 24, 2004 (Mw=6.4) are the largest seismic events in the last century that occurred on conjugate strike-slip faults trending approximately NNE-SSW and NW-SE on the Rif Mountain range (Akoglu et al., 2006). Models of the 2004 earthquake based on InSAR data suggest different fault ruptures with mainly NW-SE trending planar or curved shaped right-lateral strike-slip fault (Cakir et al., 2006; Biggs et al., 2006; Tahayt et al., 2009), consistent with the aftershocks distribution on surface and in deep (Van der Woerd et al., 2014). In this study, the postseismic deformation is studied using the Synthetic Aperture Radar Small Baseline (SBAS) technique. InSAR time series calculated from 15 Envisat ASAR images using Stanford Method of Persistent Scatterers (Hooper, 2008) reveal the subtle ground movements on the Al Hoceima region between 2004 and 2010 where a remarkable coseismic displacement was observed after the earthquake. SBAS analysis shows up to 4 cm cumulative line-of-sight movement towards and away from the satellite in the region of coseismic surface deformation, which is in good agreement with right-lateral strike-slip motion. The spatial pattern of the postseismic deformation field however requires not only afterslip on the coseismic fault but also aseismic slip on a fault that splays from the coseismic rupture to northeast. Reactivation of the fault splay is most likely caused by postseismic afterslip on the coseismic fault plane itself. On the basis of these new observations we revised the coseismic model using the same data set (one ascending and one descending interferogram) used by Cakir et al., (2006). The results suggest that the earthquake rupture took place on a fault with listric geometry and a synthetic fault on the hangingwall was reactivated during the postseismic period.",

            "abstract": "The structure of the upper mantle beneath the Alps and the Apennines has been extensively studied in the past, and several studies have been focused on the seismic anisotropic properties to delineate the strain distribution in the litho-asthenospheric region. However, Northern Apennines, Alps and surrounding regions are often studied separately, and a joint interpretation of the Alps-Apennines transition zone is still lacking. In this perspective, the China-Italy-France Alps seismic survey (CIFALPS) provided an improved image of the crust and upper mantle beneath the southwestern Alps and the Alps-Apennines transition zone. Here, we present the SKS shear wave splitting results obtained from the analysis of teleseismic data recorded by 55 temporary seismic stations along the CIFALPS profile. The strain-induced lattice preferred orientation of olivine minerals within the upper mantle, expressed by the analysis, confirms the NW trending fast polarization directions parallel to the strike of the orogen, in good agreement with the results of previous studies all along the Alpine chain. Instead, a scattering in the distribution of new shear wave splitting measurements is evidenced in the Po Plain, where the coexistence of both NNE-SSW and E-W directions provides new insights on upper mantle deformation in the complex transition zone between the Alps and the Apennines.",

            "abstract": "During 2013, a multi-scale campaign was undertaken on Alaska’s North Slope to characterize the sources and mixing of water in the atmosphere, surface waters, and ecosystems through the use of water vapor isotopes. A 3-m micrometerological tower was installed at the Toolik Lake Field Station in Northern Alaska in late winter that collected continuous measurements of (δ2H and δ18O) at four levels (surface, in canopy, above canopy, and at 3 m) from early May to late August using a Picarro laser spectrometer. A second Picarro instrument flew onboard a research aircraft, sampling water vapor at altitudes from 100 to 5000 m during three campaigns (June, July, August). These campaigns were coordinated with special collections from the Tropospheric Emissions Spectrometer (TES) onboard the Aura satellite. Finally, water isotopes from a database of measurements of surface waters and vegetation were also used to describe a climatological isoscape. Measurements were compared across spatial and temporal scales and numerical weather model trajectories were used to help analyze vapor source regions and modes of variability. There were three critical findings: a) in situ, continuous water vapor isotope δ2H, δ18O and d-excess values reflected the diurnal patterns of transpiration by moist tussock tundra and the daily to weekly variation in synoptic climatology associated with switching meteoric moisture sources; b) aircraft measurements suggested that the traceable isotopic signature of the ecohydrosphere may be limited to near ground measurements in the Arctic; c) simultaneous TES water vapor isotope values were significantly recalibrated by the aircraft measurements, showing a-priori algorithms need adjusting in the Arctic. Collectively, this multiscale approach reflects the temporal and spatial complexity of the Alaskan water isotope cycle and the value of stationary and mobile research platform coordination.",

            "abstract": "The governing factors of stable isotopic compositions of precipitation in the tropics are highly uncertain and controversial, but the knowledge of such factors is very useful for our understanding of the regional climate. We analyzed d18O and d2H of daily precipitation samples collected from several meteorological stations in Singapore between November 2013 and the present, and examined their possible control factors. The d18O value varies from 1.41 to -17.52‰, and the d2H value from 11.92 to -126.70‰. The samples with the lowest d-values were collected during two different periods: the beginning of the 2013/2014 Asian winter monsoon and the end of the intra-monsoon season (May 2014).\nAir mass trajectories and atmospheric re-analysis data reveal that some subtropical intro-seasonal systems are likely the major causes of the lowest d-values observed in precipitation; these systems brought moisture with very low d-values to the study area in December 2013 from the North Hemisphere subtropics, and in May 2014 from the South Hemisphere subtropics. During the period without significant intrusion of subtropical weather systems, local moisture from the Indian Ocean and the West Pacific Ocean is the major source for the precipitation in the area, and thus the corresponding d-values of the precipitation tend to be relatively high.\nThere is no significant correlation existing between d-values of daily precipitation and rain amounts. A weak negative correction, however, is observed between the d-values of daily precipitation and in-situ relative humidity. This suggests some significant evaporative enrichment in raindrops during the condensation in the dry seasons, e.g., between February and March 2014, during which the precipitation samples collected generally have the highest d-values. Further data analysis and studies are needed to investigate the influences of other climate processes on the stable isotopic compositions of daily precipitation in Singapore.",

Steric sea level rise similarly increases with cumulative emissions and depends on the climate sensitivity of the bulk ocean, ranging from 0.4 K to 2.7 K; a factor 0.4±0.2 smaller than that for surface temperature based on diagnostics of two Earth System models.

            "abstract": "The response of a stratocumulus cloud deck to aerosols involves a complex interplay between cloud microphysics, precipitation, cold pool dynamical interactions between neighboring cells, cloud top entrainment and the boundary layer structure over larger scales. Such feedbacks are thought to be involved in, for example, the formation of Pockets of Open Cells (POCs), which represent a large albedo change relative to the closed cell regime. However, they are not represented in GCM parameterizations and have also so far have not been simulated adequately in mesoscale models, which is a necessary step in order to develop parameterizations. We will show results from high resolution (<1 km) mesoscale simulations of stratocumulus using a new multi-moment microphysics scheme coupled to the UK Met Office Unified Model. The new scheme represents the processing of aerosol by clouds, allowing examination of the feedbacks between cloud dynamics, microphysics and aerosol. Results will be shown for domains of order 1000km that are driven by meteorological analysis, allowing realistic forcing and large scale interactions, in contrast to idealized LES simulations. Additionally, a representation of sub-grid vertical velocities based on resolved motions has been implemented, which will allow consistent droplet activation across a range of horizontal model resolutions. A cloud scheme to account for sub-grid humidity variability was also added and was found to be necessary in order to simulate realistic clouds.",

            "abstract": "Natural deformation of rocks is often associated with differentiation processes leading to irreversible transformations of their microstructural thus leading in turn to modifications of their rheological properties. The mechanisms of development of such processes at work during diagenesis, metamorphism or fault differentiation are poorly known as they are not easy to reproduce in the laboratory due to the long duration required for most of chemically controlled differentiation processes.\nHere we show that experimental compaction with layering development, similar to what happens in natural deformation, can be obtained in the laboratory by indenter techniques. Samples of plaster mixed with clay and samples of diatomite loosely interbedded with clays were loaded during several months at 40°C (plaster) and 150°C (diatomite) in presence of their saturated solutions. High-resolution X-ray tomography and SEM studies show that the layering development is a self-organized process. Stress driven dissolution of the soluble minerals (gypsum in plaster, silica in diatomite) is initiated in the zones initially richer in clays because the kinetics of diffusive mass transfer along the clay/soluble mineral interfaces is much faster than along the healed boundaries of the soluble minerals. The passive concentration of the clay minerals amplifies the localization of the dissolution along some layers oriented perpendicular to the maximum compressive stress component. Conversely, in the areas with initial low content in clay and clustered soluble minerals, dissolution is more difficult as the grain boundaries of the soluble species are healed together. These areas are less deformed and they act as rigid objects that concentrate the dissolution near their boundaries thus amplifying the differentiation.\nApplications to fault processes are discussed: i) localized pressure solution and sealing processes may lead to fault rheology differentiation with a partition between two end-member behaviors: seismic (in sealed zones) and aseismic (in dissolved zones); ii) tectonic layering may lead to highly anisotropic structures with a drastic decrease of the rock strength parallel to the layering.",

            "abstract": "Polar cap patches is a common phenomenon in the Earth polar ionosphere. They are associated with turbulent instabilities giving rise to severe disturbances to High Frequency (HF) radio communications, over-the-horizon radar location errors, and disruption and errors to satellite navigation and communication systems. Their formation and evolution are still poorly understood, particularly under disturbed space weather conditions, and there is not yet established any forecasting tool to predict their occurrence. Here we report the first direct and continuous monitoring of a complicated evolution of a newly created patch during a geomagnetic storm. The observations reveal that the patch was segmented from the high density \"tongue\" of ionization (TOI) by a subauroral polarization stream (SAPS) near the polar cap boundary associated with a substorm . The patch did not follow the expected route across the polar cap from dayside to nightside, but instead was halted by a local disturbance in the polar cap due to a rapidly changing in interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) condition and evolved in a particular way with quickly fading associated with the high-latitude lobe reconnection. These results give essential new insight into the formation of the patches and their evolution as controlled by the IMF, and offer a key opportunity for improving polar ionospheric modeling and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) scintillation and space weather forecasts.",

            "abstract": "Seismic tomography models have revealed that there exist two large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs) in the Earth’s lower mantle beneath Africa and the Pacific Ocean. Waveform modeling results further identify that LLSVPs have sharp side boundaries, suggesting that they are compositionally heterogeneous from the ambient mantle. The structures of LLSVPs are significantly influenced by the whole mantle convection. When imposing the plate motion history in the last 120 Ma at the surface as a driving mechanism, the geographic positions of the two LLSVPs can be well explained using geodynamics modeling. However, two prominent features of LLSVPs, steep side boundaries and high elevations up to the mid-mantle at ~1500 km depth, can hardly be explained by these models. Here, we include the effects of iron spin transition of ferropericlase in our mantle convection model which leads to substantial physical property change for the mantle materials. We found that if the coefficient of thermal expansion decreases by a factor of 2 or 3 from the surface to the core-mantle boundary and chemical density anomaly is between 2.0-2.6%, huge chemical blocks emerge in our models with steep side boundaries and high elevations up to ~1500 km depth. Such blocks cause a decrease of shear wave velocity of ~4% which is comparable to the seismic observations. Our results show that iron spin transition plays a dominant role in shaping the morphology of LLSVPs. Our results also show that these LLSVPs are transient structures in the lower mantle which can typically last for a few hundred million years, before destroyed by mantle motion.",

In addition, the variability of environmental conditions under which agroforestry stands can be successfully developed is unknown. Under Belgian pedoclimatic conditions, tree-crop competition for light might be the principal limiting factor in the agroforestry context. Most studies show that shade stress induces a systematic reduction of final crop yield. However, the response of a specific crop to shade is highly dependent on environmental conditions. In agroforestry systems, the tree canopy reduces the incident radiation for the crop following a dynamic spatio-temporal pattern. In this study, we will report on the efficiency of wheat under artificial dynamic shade in the experimental farm of Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech, Belgium in order to evaluate it’s potential for agroforestry purposes in the same region. Wheat productivity and development under artificial shade conditions have been monitored during 1 year and the observations will be continued for 2 more years. We constructed an artificial shade structure, which mimics the light environment observed under hybrid walnut agroforestry trees: periodic fluctuation in radiation transmittance and discontinuous light quantity. We collected information on biomass development, soil state and radiation patterns in the field. Using this data, we evaluated the influence of dynamic shade, light availability and the efficiency with which energy is converted in wheat dry matter under the artificial shade treatment. This, in combination with modeling, will allow a thorough study of the potential of wheat-walnut agroforestry systems in the Hesbaye region in Belgium.",

Understanding their distribution in the inner magnetosphere is important to estimate their energy source and generation processes. In this study, we investigate the spatial distribution of ULF wave occurrence at L=3-7, for toroidal, poloidal, and compressional modes, in Pc3-5 frequency ranges using magnetic field data obtained by Van Allen Probes from October 2012 to July 2014. We find that azimuthal Pc5 waves are frequently observed on the dayside, in particular on the morning side. Poloidal Pc4-5 waves appear on the dayside and in the pre-midnight region.Azimuthal wave number of ULF waves is an important parameter. Most of the previous studies estimated the azimuthal wave number by using ground magnetometers or HF radars. Since the observation of azimuthal wave number in space needs multiple satellites, there are only a few studies that estimated the azimuthal wave number. Van Allen Probes consist of two spacecraft, and we can calculate the azimuthal wave number from a phase difference of ULF waves observed by these probes. We choose events in which the azimuthal and radial separation between satellites are within 2.5 degrees and 0.1 Re, respectively. We find about 30 events in which satellites satisfy the above criteria and simultaneously observe ULF waves. One of the events shows the azimuthal wave number of about -190 in pre-midnight at L~5.8.In the presentation, we will discuss the results in detail in comparison with past studies.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial Environmental Observatories (TERENO) is an interdisciplinary and long-term research project spanning an Earth observation network across Germany. It includes four test sites within Germany from the North German lowlands to the Bavarian Alps and is operated by six research centers of the Helmholtz Association. TERENO Northeast is one of the sub-observatories of TERENO and is operated by the German Research Centre for Geosciences GFZ in Potsdam. This observatory investigates geoecological processes in the northeastern lowland of Germany by collecting large amounts of environmentally relevant data.\nThe success of long-term projects like TERENO depends on well-organized data management, data exchange between the partners involved and on the availability of the captured data. Data discovery and dissemination are facilitated not only through data portals of the regional TERENO observatories but also through a common spatial data infrastructure TEODOOR (TEreno Online Data repOsitORry). TEODOOR bundles the data, provided by the different web services of the single observatories, and provides tools for data discovery, visualization and data access. The TERENO Northeast data infrastructure integrates data from more than 200 instruments and makes data available through standard web services. TEODOOR accesses the OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) interfaces offered by the regional observatories.\nIn addition to the SWE interface, TERENO Northeast also publishes time series of environmental sensor data through the online research data publication platform DataCite. The metadata required by DataCite are created in an automated process by extracting information from the SWE SensorML to create ISO 19115 compliant metadata. The GFZ data management tool kit panMetaDocs is used to register Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) and preserve file based datasets. In addition to DOI, the International Geo Sample Numbers (IGSN) is used to uniquely identify research specimens.",

            "abstract": "The study of contourite drifts is an increasingly used tool for understanding the climate history of the oceans. In this paper we analyse two contourite drifts along the continental margin west of Spitsbergen, just south of the Fram Strait where significant water mass exchanges impact the Arctic climate. We detail the internal geometry and the morphologic characteristics of the two drifts on the base of multichannel seismic reflection data, sub-bottom profiles and bathymetry. These mounded features, that we propose to name Isfjorden and Bellsund drifts, are located on the continental slope between 1200 and 1800 m depth, whereas the upper slope is characterized by reduced- or non-deposition. The more distinct Isfjorden Drift is about 25 km wide and 45 km long, and over 200 ms TWT thick. We revise the 13 years-long time series of velocity, temperature, and salinity obtained from a mooring array across the Fram Strait. Two distinct current cores are visible in the long-term average. The shallower current core has an average northward velocity of about 20 cm/s, while the deeper bottom current core at about 1450 m depth has an average northward velocity of about 9 cm/s. We consider Norwegian Sea Deep Water episodically ventilated by relatively dense and turbid shelf water from the Barents Sea responsible for the accumulation of the contourites. The onset of the drift growth west of Spitsbergen is inferred to be about 1.3 Ma and related to the Early Pleistocene glacial expansion recorded in the area. The lack of mounded contouritic deposits on the continental slope of the Storfjorden is related to consecutive erosion by glacigenic debris flows. The Isfjorden and Bellsund drifts are inferred to contain the record of the regional palaeoceanography and glacial history and may constitute an excellent target of future scientific drilling.",

            "abstract": "Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) is a key component of mitigation strategies in future socio-economic scenarios that aim to keep mean global temperature rise below 2°C above pre-industrial, which would require net negative carbon emissions in the end of the 21st century. Because of the additional need for land, developing sustainable low-carbon scenarios requires careful consideration of the land-use implications of deploying large-scale BECCS. We evaluated the feasibility of the large-scale BECCS in RCP2.6, which is a scenario with net negative emissions aiming to keep the 2°C temperature target, with a top-down analysis of required yields and a bottom-up evaluation of BECCS potential using a process-based global crop model. Land-use change carbon emissions related to the land expansion were examined using a global terrestrial biogeochemical cycle model. Our analysis reveals that first-generation bioenergy crops would not meet the required BECCS of the RCP2.6 scenario even with a high fertilizer and irrigation application. Using second-generation bioenergy crops can marginally fulfill the required BECCS only if a technology of full post-process combustion CO2 capture is deployed with a high fertilizer application in the crop production. If such an assumed technological improvement does not occur in the future, more than doubling the area for bioenergy production for BECCS around 2050 assumed in RCP2.6 would be required, however, such scenarios implicitly induce large-scale land-use changes that would cancel half of the assumed CO2 sequestration by BECCS. Otherwise a conflict of land-use with food production is inevitable.",

            "abstract": "The real-time fluid analysis has been applied in some important drilling engineering. Recently the fluid analysis has just been completed in WFSD-1, WFSD- 2 and WFSD-4 holes, the accumulated analytical period of which is about 1200 days and the completed drilling depth is probable 8000 meters. We could see from the real-time analysis results in May 19, 2009, that the multi components of drilling mud gas change significantly, especially the abnormal changes of methane, oxygen and helium. And the high abnormal value of methane reaches 8.37% (v/v), which has exceeded the explosion concentration value of methane.\nDue to a few actual reasons, such as no mud circulation, the period of real-time fluid analysis would shorter than that of drilling process. The actual period of fluid analysis in WFSD-2 hole is from October 14, 2009 to April 5, 2012, so the statistical analysis of the aftershock information and the magnitude effort were both considered during this period. According to the relationship between magnitude and seismic energy of earthquake, the monthly earthquake energy values were estimated. Estimation approach is based on the formula proposed by the seismologist Richter in 1953, in which the energy value of aftershock between Ms. 3.0 and Ms. 4.0 is defined as 1, that of aftershocks between Ms. 4.0 and Ms. 5.0 is multiplied by 31.6, and that of between Ms. 5.0 and Ms. 6.0 is multiplied by 1000. Then the monthly curve of estimated energy values is showed in Fig. (Monthly curve of estimated energy value of aftershock more than 3.0 during drilling WFSD-2. X-axis represents the month, Y-axis represents the estimated energy value).\nWe could find that some special corresponding periods through the comparison of fluid change and the energy estimated values of aftershocks from the Fig. and the poster (Fall Meeting AGU 2013, San Francisco, T23E-2645), which had showed the ratio curves of the minimum and mean value, the maximum and mean value over time. We can see that the curve of estimated energy value appears the two most obvious peaks, the period of which is consistent with that of fluid components ratio peaks. Moreover, the periods of the other two more obvious peaks of the estimated energy values appears in October, 2010 and May, 2011. The curve of fluid components ratio also shows two more obvious change just in the two same periods.",

            "abstract": "Reliable and accurate forecasts for wind and photovoltaic (PV) power production are essential for stable transmission systems. A high potential for improving the wind and PV power forecasts lies in optimizing the weather forecasts, since these energy sources are highly weather dependent. For this reason the main objective of the German research project EWeLiNE is to improve the quality the underlying numerical weather predictions towards energy operations. In this project, the German Meteorological Service (DWD), the Fraunhofer Institute for Wind Energy and Energy System Technology, and three of the German transmission system operators (TSOs) are working together to improve the weather and power forecasts. Probabilistic predictions are of particular interest, as the quantification of uncertainties provides an important tool for risk management. Theoretical considerations suggest that it can be advantageous to use probabilistic information to represent and respond to the remaining uncertainties in the forecasts. However, it remains a challenge to integrate this information into the decision making processes related to market participation and power systems operations. The project is planned and carried out in close cooperation with the involved TSOs in order to ensure the usability of the products developed. It will conclude with a demonstration phase, in which the improved models and newly developed products are combined into a process chain and used to provide information to TSOs in a real-time decision support tool. The use of a web-based development platform enables short development cycles and agile adaptation to evolving user needs.\nThis contribution will present the EWeLiNE project and discuss ideas on how to incorporate probabilistic information into the users' current decision making processes.",

The results provide improved resolution and coverage compared to previous results obtained from cross-over methods.\nAlso, we find that temporal changes in the elevation change rate can be derived from Envisat data, and show clear examples of this by generating five-year running means for selected areas of the Greenland ice sheet.\nFor a period between 2003 and 2009, the elevation of the ice sheets was measured by both the laser altimeter on board ICESat and the radar altimeter on board Envisat. We compare rates of elevation change derived from ICESat and Envisat for this time span in which both sensors were operating. We focus on the area above the equilibrium line altitude, in order to specifically derive information on snow parameters. A comparison of the elevation changes observed by the two sensors shows a complex pattern, which can be explained regionally by model output describing the changes in both firn air content and accumulation rates.",

            "abstract": "The high concentration of the major nutrients nitrate and phosphate in the Antarctic Zone of the Southern Ocean dictates the nature of Southern Ocean ecosystems and permits these nutrients to be carried from the deep ocean into the nutrient-limited low latitudes. Incomplete nutrient consumption in the Antarctic also allows the leakage of deeply sequestered carbon dioxide (CO2) back to the atmosphere, and changes in this leakage may have driven glacial/interglacial cycles in atmospheric CO2. In a sediment core from the Pacific sector of the Antarctic Ocean, we report diatom-bound N isotope (δ15Ndb) records for total recoverable diatoms and two assemblages of diatom species. These data indicate tight coupling between the degree of nitrate consumption and Antarctic climate across the last two glacial cycles, with δ15Ndb (and thus the degree of nitrate consumption) increasing at each major Antarctic cooling event. Measurements in the same sediment core indicate that export production was reduced during ice ages, pointing to an ice age reduction in the supply of deep ocean-sourced nitrate to the Antarctic Ocean surface. The reduced export production of peak ice ages also implies a weaker winter-to-summer decline (i.e. reduced seasonality) in mixed layer nitrate concentration, providing a plausible explanation for an observed reduction in the inter-assemblage δ15Ndb difference during these coldest times. Despite the weak summertime productivity, the reduction in wintertime nitrate supply from deep waters left the Antarctic mixed layer with a low nitrate concentration, and this wintertime change also would have reduced the outgassing of CO2. Relief of light limitation fails to explain the intermediate degree of nitrate consumption that characterizes early glacial conditions, as improved light limitation coincident with reduced nitrate supply would drive nitrate consumption to completion. Thus, the data favor iron availability as the dominant control on annual Antarctic Ocean export production over glacial cycles.",

            "abstract": "Time-dependent inner core structure is interpreted as differential rotation of the Earth’s inner core. This inference is made on the basis of variations deviated from an isotropic and homogeneous inner core structure and the amount of velocity perturbations progressively evolving as a function of calendar time. Most compelling evidences for inner core rotation come from the inner core structures beneath Colombia and Venezuela, characterized by strong anisotropy and lateral variation, for the South Sandwich Islands earthquakes recorded by College (COL) and other seismic stations in Alaska. Repeating earthquakes with highly similar waveforms can minimize the potential artifacts due to inter-event separation and unknown short-scale mantle heterogeneities, and can acquire robust measurement of time shift due to temporal change of inner core structures. Moderate repeating earthquake sequences (RES) in the Tonga–Kermadec–Vanuatu in the southwest Pacific subduction zones are studied over a 20-year time window between 1990 and 2009. I select 13 RES consisting of two or three events with time separation of 2 – 14.4 years and analyze the PKiKP–PKPdf, PKPbc–PKPdf, and PKPab–PKPdf phase pairs recorded by the European, African, and central Asian stations sampling the eastern hemisphere of the inner core. I measure the double differential time of the phase pairs using waveform cross-correlation. Majority of the double differential time measurements within ±50 millisecond can largely be explained by the time shift due to inter-event distance on the order of hundreds of meters or less and null change of the PKPdf phase. These observations indicate inner core structures in the eastern hemisphere are uniform and probably insensitive to motion of the inner core.",

            "abstract": "The Puna Plateau in NW Argentina is the southern part of the second-largest orogenic plateau on Earth with a mean elevation of 4.0 ± 0.5 km (±2s). The Puna is an integral part of the south-central Andes that exhibit a steep E-W topographic and climatic gradient: The first windward topographic rise east of the Puna constitutes a significant orographic barrier resulting in high orographic rainfall. Westward, the higher-elevation areas of the windward flanks become progressively drier, until arid conditions are attained in the orogen interior. The Puna repeatedly experienced significant paleoclimatic changes reflected by fluvial and lacustrine terraces associated with lake highstands related to deeper penetration of moisture into the orogen and thus an orogenward shift of the climate gradient. The southern Puna is compartmentalized into more than 500 separate, internally-drained sedimentary basins with varying catchment size. Here, we quantify the erosion-rate gradients and their impact on basin evolution and their importance on the formation of the plateau morphology. We rely on sedimentary archives, digital topography, and a new set of cosmogenic inventories of river sands (10Be) and bedrock-erosion rates (10Be and 26Al) from the eastern and central plateau. Erosion rates from internally drained catchments in the eastern plateau are similar to the externally drained, semi-arid intermontane basins in the E Cordillera, which bounds the plateau, but are ten-fold (or more) lower than erosion rates in the humid and steep sections along the eastern windward flanks. Within the plateau realm, erosion rates are ten-fold lower in the central than in the eastern parts. We analyze high-resolution topography from ASTER- and interferometry-derived Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) that we have validated with more 10’000 differential GPS ground control points. We demonstrate distinct topometric gradients across the Puna that can be linked to spatial variations in rainfall and vegetation cover.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater is a sole resource for water supply in Jeju Island which is composed of various formations of porous volcanic rocks. Therefore, preservation of the groundwater resource is an essential issue. Due to its geological features of the island, seawater has been intruded landward, mainly in the eastern region, which restricts groundwater use in the area. In the western region, severe nitrate contaminations of groundwater have been occurred by heavily performed agricultural activities, and moreover deterioration of groundwater quality by seawater intrusion has been observed in recent years. In this study, to delineate the mixing process related to seawater intrusion into groundwater from Gosan (western region) and Pyoseon (eastern region) of Jeju Island, hydrogeochemical and multiple isotopic approaches were applied. Also, fractionation ratios of each factors (fresh groundwater, nitrate contaminated groundwater, and seawater) which affect the groundwater quality from the study areas were estimated by using the MIX_PROGRAM. The effect of seawater was observed at the groundwater wells located inland up to 1.5 km from the coast and showed to be enlarged landward during a dry season. The fractionation ratios of seawater had the minor range (0.1~1.2%) for the Pyoseon area and 0.4~3.7% of seawater was mixed with fresh groundwater in the Gosan area. Differences in hydrogeological properties between Gosan and Pyoseon areas made dissimilar occurrences of seawater mixing into groundwater in the island.",

            "abstract": "There are several subduction systems near the Japanese islands. The 2011 Mw9.0 Tohoku-oki megathrust earthquake occurred at the NE Japan (Tohoku) subduction zone. We have revealed a complementary relation between the slip areas for huge earthquakes and small repeating earthquakes (REs) in Tohoku. Investigations of REs in these subduction zones and the comparison with Tohoku area are important for revealing generation mechanism of megathrust earthquakes.\nOur target areas are Izu-Bonin and Ryukyu subduction zones, which appear to generate no large interplate earthquake. To investigate coupling of plate boundary in these regions, we estimated spatial distribution of slip rate by using REs. We use seismograms from the High Sensitivity Seismograph Network (Hi-net), Full Range Seismograph Network of Japan (F-net), and permanent seismic stations of Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), Tohoku University, University of Tokyo, and Kagoshima University from 8 May 2003 (Izu-Bonin) and 14 July 2005 (Ryukyu) to 31 December 2012 to detect REs along the two trenches, by using similarity of seismograms. We mainly follow the procedure adopted in Uchida and Matsuzawa (2013) that studied REs in Tohoku area to compare our results with the REs in Tohoku.\nWe find that the RE distribution along the Ryukyu trench shows two bands parallel to the trench axis. This feature is similar to the pattern in Tohoku where relatively large earthquakes occur between the bands. Along the Izu-Bonin trench, on the other hand, we find much fewer REs than in Tohoku or Ryukyu subduction zones and only one along-trench RE band, which corresponds to the area where the subducting Pacific plate contacts with the crust of the Philippine Sea plate. We also estimate average slip rate and coupling coefficient by using an empirical relationship between seismic moment and slip for REs (Nadeau and Johnson, 1998) and relative plate motion model. As a result, we find interplate slip rate in the deeper band is higher than shallower one along the Ryukyu trench suggesting larger locking along the shallower band. This feature is also similar to the pattern in the NE Japan. Our results indicate that the Ryukyu subduction zone is very similar to the NE Japan subduction zone, while the Izu-Bonin subduction zone appears to be different from the other two zones according to the RE analyses.",

            "abstract": "Ratios of intrusive to extrusive activity at volcanic arcs are thought to be high, with estimates ranging between 5:1 and 30:1. Understanding the geodetic response to magmatic intrusion is therefore fundamental to large-scale studies of volcano deformation, providing insight into the dynamics of the inter-eruptive period of the volcano cycle and the building of continental crust.\nIn northern California, we identify two volcanoes - Medicine Lake Volcano (MLV) and Lassen Volcanic Center (LaVC) - that exhibit long-term (multi-decadal) subsidence. We test the hypothesis that deformation at these volcanoes results from processes associated with magmatic intrusions. We first constrain the spatial and temporal characteristics of the deformation fields, establishing the first time-series of deformation at LaVC using InSAR data, multi-temporal analysis techniques and global weather models. Although the rates of deformation at the two volcanoes are similar (~1 cm/yr), our results show that the ratio of vertical to horizontal displacements is significantly different, suggesting contrasting source geometries.\nTo test the origin of deformation, we develop modeling strategies to investigate thermal and viscoelastic processes associated with magmatic intrusions. The first model we develop couples analytical geodetic models to a numerical model of volume loss due to cooling and crystallization based upon temperature-melt fraction relationships from petrological experiments. This model provides evidence that magmatic intrusion at MLV has occurred more recently than the last eruption ~1 ka. The second model we test uses a finite element approach to simulate the time-dependent viscoelastic response of the crust to magmatic intrusion. We assess the magnitude and timescales of ground deformation that may result from these processes, exploring the model parameter space before applying the models to our InSAR observations of subsidence in northern California.",

            "abstract": "Soil has a key role in the regulation of carbon, water and nutrient cycles. Traditionally, agricultural soil management was oriented towards optimizing productivity. Nowadays, mitigation of climate change effects and maintaining long-term soil quality are evenly important. Developing policy guidelines for best management practices need to be site-specific, given the large spatial variability of environmental conditions within the EU. Therefore, it is necessary to classify the different farming zones that are susceptible to soil degradation. Especially in Mediterranean areas, this variability and its susceptibility to degradation is higher than in other areas of the EU.\nThe objective of this study is therefore to delineate current agro-environmental zones in Spain and to determine the effect of global climate change on this classification in the future. The final objective is to assist policy makers in scenario analysis with respect to soil conservation.\nOur classification scheme is based on soil, topography and climate (seasonal temperature and rainfall) variables. We calculated slope and elevation based on a SRTM-derived DEM, soil texture was extracted from the European Soil Database and seasonal mean, minimum and maximum precipitation and temperature data were gridded from publically available weather station data (Aemet). Global change scenarios are average downscaled ensemble predictions for the emission scenarios A2 and B2. The k-means method was used for classification of the 10 km x 10 km gridded variables.\nUsing the before-mentioned input variables, the optimal number of agro-environmental zones we obtained is 8. The classification corresponds well with the observed distribution of farming typologies in Spain. The advantage of this method is that it is a simple, objective method which uses only readily available, public data. As such, its extrapolation to other countries of the EU is straightforward. Finally, it presents a tool for policy makers to assess the impact of global change on farming systems and to plan soil conservation measures.",

            "abstract": "With its thick, Oligocene to recent sedimentary filling, the Adana Basin of southern Turkey, located between the SE margin of the Central Anatolian Plateau (CAP) and the SW branch of the East Anatolian Fault, is ideally located to record topographic and tectonic changes in Neogene times. We correlate 34 seismic profiles with corresponding exposed units in the Adana Basin, the age constraints of which have been recently improved through detailed biostratigraphic correlation with the broader Mediterranean stratigraphy. The time-depth conversion of the interpreted profiles allows us to reconstruct the subsidence curve of the Adana Basin, which reveals a major increase in subsidence rate in late Messinian times (5.45 to 5.33 Ma), associated with the deposition of ~1500 km3 of conglomerates and marls. Our provenance and paleocurrent analyses of the exposed conglomerates reveal that most of the sediment is derived from the SE margin of the CAP and the plateau region farther north. A comparison of these results with the composition of recent fluvial conglomerates and the present drainage basins indicates major changes between late Messinian and present-day source areas. We suggest that these changes result from the uplift and ensuing erosion of the SE margin of the plateau. This hypothesis is corroborated by a comparison of the Adana Basin’s subsidence curve with that of the Mut Basin, a mainly Neogene basin located atop the CAP’s southern margin. The Adana Basin’s rapid subsidence event is approximately coeval with an uplift episode at the plateau’s southern margin (after ca. 7 Ma), and its timing provides the first minimum time constraint on the timing of plateau margin uplift. Preliminary results from a structural analysis show that extensional and transtensional structures likely helped accommodate the differential uplift of the source (CAP SE margin) relative to the sink (Adana Basin).",

            "abstract": "Soil water content plays a key role in the water and energy balance in soil, vegetation and atmosphere systems. According to Wood et al. (2011) there is a grand need to increase global-scale hyper-resolution water-energy-biogeochemistry land surface modelling capabilities. However, such a model scheme should also recognize the epistemic uncertainties, as well as the nonlinearity and hysteresis in its dynamics. Unfortunately, it is not clear how to parameterize hydrological processes as a function of scale and how to test deterministic models with regard to epistemic uncertainties. In this study, high resolution long-term simulations were conducted in the highly instrumented TERENO hydrological observatory, the Wüstebach catchment. Soil hydraulic parameters were derived using inverse modeling with the Hydrus-1D model using the global optimization scheme SCE-UA and soil moisture data from a wireless soil moisture sensor network. The estimated parameters were then used for 3D simulations using the integrated parallel simulation platform ParFlow-CLM. The simulated soil water content, as well as evapotranspiration and runoff, were compared with long-term field observations to illustrate how well the model was able to reproduce the water budget dynamics. With variable model setup scenarios in boundary conditions and anisotropy of hydraulic conductivity, we investigated how lateral flow processes above the underlying fractured bedrock affects the simulation results. Furthermore, we explored the importance of the litter layer and the heterogeneity of the forest soil in the simulation of flow processes and model performance. For the analysis of spatial patterns of simulated and observed soil water content we applied the method of empirical orthogonal function (EOF). The results suggest that strong anisotropy in the hydraulic conductivity may be the reason for the fast lateral flow observed in Wüstebach. Introduction of heterogeneity in the hydraulic properties in the hillslope and riparian zones improves estimates of soil water content and runoff, but has not significant impact on simulated actual evapotranspiration.",

It is important to investigate the effects of climate change in these settings under consideration of future agricultural management and irrigation needs. However, quantifying how irrigation influences climate-change effects is still a challenge. Understanding the differences in climate-change sensitivity between irrigated and non-irrigated catchments would allow refining regional-scale assessments of climate-change impacts.\nWe investigated a catchment in north-east Spain which had not been irrigated prior to 2006 and where 54% of the land is now converted to irrigated agriculture. Data on hydraulic heads, discharge, and irrigation were used to simulate coupled surface-subsurface flow in the catchment, using the pde-based model HydroGeoSphere. The model performs well for both irrigated and non-irrigated periods. To predict future climate scenarios in the region, we use four regional climate models from the ENSEMBLE project (P.van der Linden and J.Mitchell, ENSEMBLES: Climate Change and its Impacts [...], Met Office Hadley Center, 2009) and three downscaling methods. We further investigated four irrigation scenarios, based on projected potential evapotranspiration.\nPreliminary results show a shift in the hydrological regime of the catchment under future climate scenarios. Under irrigation, the variability of low-flow discharge increases in future climate. On the contrary, peak flows increase and hydraulics heads decrease significantly in the non-irrigated scenarios. For example, annual maximum flow increases by about 15 % in the non-irrigated case but there is only little change in the corresponding irrigated scenarios. Sensitivity to projected precipitation changes is higher without irrigation, while potential evapotranspiration has more importance for irrigated catchments.",

            "abstract": "Due to the mismatch between data volume and the performance of the Information Technology infrastructure used in seismic data centers, it becomes more and more difficult to process all the data with traditional applications in a reasonable elapsed time. To fulfill their missions, the International Data Centre of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO/IDC) and the Département Analyse Surveillance Environnement of Commissariat à l’Energie atomique et aux énergies alternatives (CEA/DASE) collect, process and produce complex data sets whose volume is growing exponentially. In the medium term, computer architectures, data management systems and application algorithms will require fundamental changes to meet the needs. This problem is well known and identified as a “Big Data” challenge.\nTo tackle this major task, the CEA/DASE takes part during two years to the “DataScale” project. Started in September 2013, DataScale gathers a large set of partners (research laboratories, SMEs and big companies). The common objective is to design efficient solutions using the synergy between Big Data solutions and the High Performance Computing (HPC). The project will evaluate the relevance of these technological solutions by implementing a demonstrator for seismic event detections thanks to massive waveform correlations.\nThe IDC has developed an expertise on such techniques leading to an algorithm called “Master Event” and provides a high-quality dataset for an extensive cross correlation study. The objective of the project is to enhance the Master Event algorithm and to reanalyze 10 years of waveform data from the International Monitoring System (IMS) network thanks to a dedicated HPC infrastructure operated by the \"Centre de Calcul Recherche et Technologie\" at the CEA of Bruyères-le-Châtel. The dataset used for the demonstrator includes more than 300,000 seismic events, tens of millions of raw detections and more than 30 terabytes of continuous seismic data from the primary IMS stations.\nIn this talk, we will present the Master Event algorithm and the associated workflow, we will give an overview of the designed technical solutions (from the building blocks to the global infrastructure), and we will show the preliminary results at a regional scale.",

            "abstract": "The central part of the Vanuatu arc is characterized by the subduction of the d'Entrecasteaux ridge under the North Fiji Basin. This ridge influences directly the seismicity and the geodynamics in the proximal region. By analyzing the hypocenters from a local microseismic catalog (2008-2009) and global catalogs we show that the subduction interface, in the first 50 km depth, presents a small dipping angle where the ridge is subducting. This bump highlights the buoyancy of the ridge associated to the excess of fluids present in the seamount. This underplating could explain 20% to 60% of the vertical displacement estimated on the forearc islands from corals datations and that can reach a maximum of 6 mm/yr. The high concentration of hydrous minerals in the subducting ridge might also explain the important activity of intermediate depth earthquakes (half of the total activity in the studied region), we observed a very good correlation between the supposed extension of the ridge in depth and the location of these earthquakes. We propose that they are associated to crust minerals dehydration that causes hydrous fracturation trough preexistent faults. This dehydration process is maintained to a maximum depth of 190 km due to the high thermal parameter of the australian plate.\nUsing the geometry of the Wadati-Benioff plane derived from earthquakes localisations, we established a 2D mechanical model to explain the horizontal interseismic displacement observed by GPS on islands of the upper plate. We show that the subduction interface alone cannot explain the GPS velocities observed, the system of thrust faults located below the back arc islands of Maewo and Pentecost, plays a major role in the region geodynamics and accommodate as much convergence as the subduction interface (between ~16 and 34 mm/yr). Using the model we were also able to explain the closing of the Aoba basin during interseismic phase (~25 mm/an). Finally, the mechanical model suggests the existence of a 23 km wide locked patch that reaches the trench.",

            "abstract": "From January to April 2014, two observing campaigns by multi-wavelength remote sensing from X-ray to radio were performed to uncover energy transport process in Jupiter’s plasma environment using space telescopes and ground-based facilities. These campaigns were triggered by the new Hisaki spacecraft launched in September 2013, which is an extremely ultraviolet (EUV) space telescope of JAXA designed for planetary observations.\nIn the first campaign in January, Hubble Space Telescope (HST) made imaging of far ultraviolet (FUV) aurora with a high special resolution (0.08”) through two weeks while Hisaki continuously monitored aurora and plasma torus emissions in EUV wavelength with a high temporal resolution (1 min<). We discovered new magnetospheric activities from the campaign data: e.g., internally-driven type auroral brightening associated with hot plasma injection, and plasma and electromagnetic filed modulations in the inner magnetosphere externally driven by the solar wind modulation.\nThe second campaign in April was performed by Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO), XMM newton, and Suzaku satellite simultaneously with Hisaki. Relativistic auroral accelerations in the polar region and hot plasma in the inner magnetosphere were captured by the X-ray space telescopes simultaneously with EUV monitoring of aurora and plasma torus. Auroral intensity in EUV indicated a clear periodicity of 45 minutes whereas the periodicity was not evident in X-ray intensity although previous observations by CXO indicated clear 40-minute periodicity in the polar cap X-ray aurora.\nIn this presentation, we show remarkable scientific results obtained these campaigns.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have suggested a new mechanism that can be used to explain the formation of magnetic spots or bipolar regions in highly stratified turbulent plasmas. According to this model, a large-scale magnetic field suppresses the turbulent pressure, which leads to a negative contribution of turbulence to the effective magnetic pressure. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) have confirmed that the negative contribution is large enough so that the effective magnetic pressure becomes negative and leads to a large-scale instability, which we refer to as negative effective magnetic pressure Instability (NEMPI). NEMPI was used to explain the formation of active regions and sunspots on the solar surface.\nOne step toward improving this model was to combine dynamo in- stability with NEMPI. The dynamo is known to be responsible for the solar large-scale magnetic field and to play a role in solar activity. In this context, we studied stratified turbulent plasmas in spherical geometry, where the background field was generated by alpha squared dynamo. For NEMPI to be excited, the initial magnetic field should be in a proper range, so we used quenching function for alpha. Using the Pencil Code and mean field simulations (MFS), we showed that in the presence of dynamo-generated magnetic fields, we deal with a coupled system, where both instabilities, dynamo and NEMPI, work together and lead to the formation of magnetic structures (Jabbari et al. 2013).\nWe also studied a similar system in plane geometry in the presence of rotation and confirmed that for slow rotation NEMPI works, but as the Coriolis number increases, the rotation suppresses NEMPI. By increasing the Coriolis number even further, the combination of fast rotation and high stratification excites a dynamo, which leads again to a coupled system of dynamo and NEMPI (Jabbari et al. 2014).\nAnother important finding concerning NEMPI is the case where the instability is excited by a vertical magnetic field (Brandenburg et al. 2013). When the field is vertical, the resulting magnetic flux concentrations lead to the magnetic spots and can be of equipartition field strength. DNS, MFS, and implicit large eddy simulations (ILES) confirm that in a proper parameter regime, vertical imposed fields lead to the formation of circular magnetic spots (Brandenburg et al. 2014).",

However, the concentration of soil gas samples is changeable depending on water table fluctuation. This trend was shown in Woosan Industrial Complex (WIC) site in Korea. To understand this phenomenon in the field laboratory experiments were performed under controllable condition.\nContinuous soil gas extraction and sampling method was conducted at the laboratory with several different cases. Three cases assume the experimental conditions which were 1) only residual source of TCE exists in vadose zone; 2) only dissolved source of TCE in water exists; 3) not only residuals source but also dissolved source exist in the usual position.\n A two-dimensional model tank was used for the laboratory scale test. The STOMP-WOA model program was also operated to calculate the TCE gas concentration changes. The concentration represented changes opposite to the water table change as the concentration increased when water table decreased.

This study investigates the dynamics of N2O emissions from a nitritation-anammox reactor, and links its interpretation to the nitrogen and oxygen isotopic signature of the emitted N2O. A 400-litre single-stage nitritation-anammox reactor was operated and continuously fed with digester liquid. The isotopic composition of N2O emissions was monitored online with quantum cascade laser absorption spectroscopy (QCLAS; Aerodyne Research, Inc.; Waechter et al., 2008). Dissolved ammonium and nitrate were monitored online (ISEmax, Endress + Hauser), while nitrite was measured with test strips (Nitrite-test 0-24mgN/l, Merck).\nTable 1.

A less likely explanation is that the SP of N2O was increased by partial N2O reduction by heterotrophic denitrification. Various experiments were conducted to further investigate N2O formation pathways in the reactor. Our data reveal that N2O emissions increased when reactor operation was not ideal, for example when dissolved oxygen was too high (Table 1). SP measurements confirmed that these N2O peaks were due to enhanced nitrifier denitrification, generally related to nitrite build-up in the reactor (Figure 1; Table 1). Overall, process control via online N2O monitoring was confirmed to be an ideal method to detect imbalances in reactor operation and regulate aeration, to ensure optimal reactor conditions and minimise N2O emissions.\n",

Presently, it is the only drill hole that has sampled all three oceanic crust layers in a tectonically undisturbed setting. Here we interpret down-hole trends in several rock-magnetic parameters with fuzzy c-means cluster analysis, a multivariate statistical technique. The parameters include the magnetization ratio, the coercivity ratio, the coercive force, the low-field susceptibility, and the Curie temperature. By their combined, multivariate, analysis the effects of magmatic and hydrothermal processes can be evaluated. The optimal number of clusters – a key point in the analysis because there is no a priori information on this – was determined through a combination of approaches: by calculation of several cluster validity indices, by testing for coherent cluster distributions on non-linear-map plots, and importantly by testing for stability of the cluster solution from all possible starting points. Here, we consider a solution robust if the cluster allocation is independent of the starting configuration. The five-cluster solution appeared to be robust. Three clusters are distinguished in the extrusive segment of the Hole that express increasing hydrothermal alteration of the lavas. The sheeted dike and gabbro portions are characterized by two clusters, both with higher coercivities than in lava samples. Extensive alteration, however, can obliterate magnetic property differences between lavas, dikes, and gabbros. The imprint of thermochemical alteration on the iron-titanium oxides is only partially related to the porosity of the rocks. All clusters display rock magnetic characteristics in line with a stable NRM. This implies that the entire sampled sequence of ocean crust can contribute to marine magnetic anomalies. Determination of the absolute paleointensity with thermal techniques is not straightforward because of the propensity of oxyexsolution during laboratory heating and/or the presence of intergrowths. The upper part of the extrusive sequence, the granoblastic portion of the dikes, and moderately altered gabbros may contain a comparatively uncontaminated thermoremanent magnetization.",

The calculated degree days were compared to the electricity consumption of ground source heat pump (GSHP) system in the study area. The results showed that there is a high correlation between the electricity consumption and degree days.\nBased upon such relationship, heating and cooling degree days were calculated using the future weather files from Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios.

            "abstract": "Nyamulagira is the westernmost volcano of the Virunga volcanic province, in the western branch of the East African Rift. This shield volcano is one of the most active African volcanoes with one eruption every 1-4 year(s). Nyamulagira’s eruptions usually occur along the flanks of the main edifice and in the lava plain, producing pyroclastic cone(s) and 10-20 km-long lava flows. Between 1913 and 1938, the activity was however restricted to the summit caldera, where lava fountains progressively gave birth to a lava lake, which disappeared in 1938 during the partial collapse of the summit caldera and the onset of a 2.5 years-long flank eruption. The location of flank eruptions and the orientation of the eruptive fissures are strongly influenced by the edifice loading, and by the NNW-SSE fracture network that crosses the main edifice and link it to the neighboring Nyiragongo volcano. But rift fault can also influence fissure orientations and cone alignments, especially for distal events. The flank eruptions typically have similar characteristics, lasting few days to few weeks, with an average of 20-30 days. Less frequently, flank eruptions can be larger and more complex, lasting several months and/or emitting much larger volumes of lava. By combining historical and recent observations, we suggest that magma overpressure at shallow depth is the main cause of flank events. Major eruptions seem to be related to a deeper source able to trigger large magma injections through deep structures, such as rift faults. Since April 2012, the activity of Nyamulagira is restricted to the summit caldera, with continuous and intense gas emissions and, since mid-2014, by lava fountains. This change in eruptive behavior, if it persists, may leads to the emergence of a new lava lake and may significantly decreases the frequency of flank events",

We found robust increases in summer precipitation over the Maritime Continent Islands and decreases in summer precipitation over the northern Maritime Continent seas, similar to the resolution sensitivity seen in other studies. These precipitation changes near the Maritime Continent can be large, exceeding 5 mm/day, and are the largest changes in tropical precipitation as resolution is increased.\nTo explore the source of these changes, we present novel experiments to diagnose the role of increased resolution of different components of the AGCM, such as the orography, coastlines and atmospheric dynamics, in the Maritime Continent domain. Our results suggest that total orographic precipitation in the Maritime Continent domain is resolution dependent at these scales. While increased precipitation associated with the higher resolution of the mean orography (see Figure 1) is compensated for by decreasing precipitation associated with changes in the subgrid orography and its effect on parameterized drag, the total orographic precipitation is not equal across resolutions. Changes in moisture convergence, precipitation and circulation due to improved resolution of the orography then affect precipitation in the wider Indo-Pacific region.",

            "abstract": "Occupying the upper troposphere over the Eurasia during boreal summer, the South Asian High (SAH) is thought to be a critical regulator of East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM), a system of particular important for regional climate and regional water cycle over the East Asia. In this study, the mechanisms responsible for the interannual variation of SAH intensity are investigated. When the SAH is strong, the 200 hPa geopotential height in the high center increases and the high system expands. Significant anomalies of the geopotential height were found over the Middle East, and to the east of the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The upper tropospheric temperature increases, while the precipitation increases over the Yangtze River Valley but decreases over the Middle East. The diagnosis of atmospheric dynamics and the numerical experiments consistently shown that the interannual variation of the SAH intensity is strongly influenced by summer precipitation over the Yangtze River Valley associated with EASM.The mechanisms are three-fold. First, the excessive EASM precipitation excites a local anticyclone in the upper troposphere according to Sverdrup Vorticity Balance, which leads to the eastward extension of the eastern edge of the SAH. In addition, condensational heating related to EASM warms the upper troposphere (200-400 hPa), reinforcing the geopotential height anomalies over East TP and East China. Furthermore, the monsoonal heating excites a westward propagating Rossby wave train, increasing geopotential height over the Middle East and inhibits the local precipitation. In conclusion, our study results in a new mechanistic paradigm in which the EASM is driving the SAH variation rather than passive response as traditionally thought.",

            "abstract": "Bayesian model averaging (BMA) ranks and averages a set of plausible, competing models, based on their fit to available data and based on their model complexity. BMA requires determining Bayesian model evidence (BME), which is the likelihood of the observed data integrated over each model parameter space. The BME integral is highly challenging, because it is as high-dimensional as the number of model parameters. Three classes of techniques are available to evaluate BME, each with its own challenges and limitations:\nExact analytical solutions are fast, but restricted by strong assumptions.\nBrute-force numerical evaluation is accurate, but quickly becomes computationally unfeasible.\nApproximations known as information criteria (AIC, BIC, KIC) are known to yield contradicting results in model ranking.\nWe conduct a systematic comparison of available techniques to evaluate BME, including a list of numerical schemes. We highlight their common features and differences, and investigate their computational effort and accuracy. For the latter, we investigate the impact of (a) data set size and (b) overlap between the prior and the likelihood. We use a synthetic example with an exact analytical solution (as a first-time validation against a true solution), and a real-world hydrological application, where we use a brute-force Monte-Carlo method as benchmark solution.\nOur results show that all IC differ drastically in their quality of approximation. From all IC, the KIC evaluated at the MAP performs best, but in general none of them is satisfying for non-linear model problems. Since they share the goodness-of-fit term, the observed differences imply an inaccurate penalty for model complexity. Our findings indicate that the choice of approximation method substantially influences the accuracy of the BME estimate and, consequently, the final model ranking and BMA results.",

Nevertheless, considerable evidence for substantial glaciation events has been identified in both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere prior to the Quaternary. Evidence on land is fragmentary, but marine records of glaciation present a more complete history of Pliocene glaciation. A global compilation of glacial evidence (De Schepper et al. 2014) demonstrates that there are four large glaciation events in the Southern and/or Northern Hemisphere prior to the latest Pliocene intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation. Two global glacial events are identified in the early Pliocene, one around the early/late Pliocene transition, and one during the late Pliocene Marine Isotope Stage M2.\n",

            "abstract": "Expedition 349 is the first drilling expedition in the new International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) and successfully drilled 5 sites in the South China Sea (SCS), a marginal basin whose origin is largely debated. An important objective of the expedition is to obtain oceanic crust samples to better determine the timing of the beginning and the end of spreading. Three of the Expedition 349 drill sites, U1431, U1433, and U1434, located near fossil spreading centers, recovered oceanic crust basalts. The recovered oceanic crust at Site U1431E consists of massive flows up to 26 m thick with thin, rubbly, aphyric to olivine-phyric flow tops. The massive flows are fine- to coarse- grained, with a mineral assemblage of olivine, plagioclase, and clinopyroxene, typical of mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB). Plagioclases forming variolitic texture are common, indicating rapid initial cooling while coarsening grain size toward the center suggests slower cooling in the interior of these massive flows. The igneous basement at Sites U1433B and U1434 consists mainly of thinner, pillowed flows associated with hyaloclastite breccias. At Site U1433B, the upper section is composed of 38 m-thick pillowed flow units followed by 23 m-thick massive flow units. Recovery at Site U1434 was poor, with only ~3 m of mostly aphyric basalt with glassy to microcrystalline texture. The pillow basalt flows at Site U1433B are dominantly plagioclase-phyric, with minor olivine microphenocrysts, and mostly plagioclase and clinopyroxene as groundmass minerals, resembling MORB mineralogy. Chilled margins are common, with occasional remnants of fresh glass in them. Plagioclases in these thinner flows often form variolitic textures and exhibit zoning, with melt inclusions along cracks and cleavage planes, suggesting fast crystallization growth within compositionally evolving magma. The massive flow units at Site U1433B are similar to those at Site U1431E. Initial onboard major and minor elements data indicate that the igneous basement at Sites U1431E and U1433B are tholeiitic basalts similar to Pacific and Indian MORBs and different in composition from the alkalic seamount basalts of the SCS. Acquisition of geochemical data to test the origin of the oceanic crust of the SCS is ongoing and preliminary results will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Lake Kinneret (Lake Tiberias or Sea of Galilee) is the most important freshwater reservoir in the Northern Jordan Valley. Simulations that couple fluid flow, heat and mass transport are built to understand the mechanisms responsible for the salinization of this important resource. Here the effects of permeability distribution on 2D and 3D convective patterns are compared.\n2D simulations indicate that thermal brine in Haon and some springs in the Yamourk Gorge (YG) are the result of mixed convection, i.e. the interaction between the regional flow from the bordering heights and thermally-driven flow (Magri et al., 2014). Calibration of the calculated temperature profiles suggests that the faults in Haon and the YG provides paths for ascending hot waters, whereas the fault in the Golan recirculates water between 1 and 2 km depths. At higher depths, faults induce 2D layered convection in the surrounding units.\nThe 2D assumption for a faulted basin can oversimplify the system, and the conclusions might not be fully correct. The 3D results also point to mixed convection as the main mechanism for the thermal anomalies. However, in 3D the convective structures are more complex allowing for longer flow paths and residence times. In the fault planes, hydrothermal convection develops in a finger regime enhancing inflow and outflow of heat in the system. Hot springs can form locally at the surface along the fault trace. By contrast, the layered cells extending from the faults into the surrounding sediments are preserved and are similar to those simulated in 2D. The results are consistent with the theory from Zhao et al. (2003), which predicts that 2D and 3D patterns have the same probability to develop given the permeability and temperature ranges encountered in geothermal fields. The 3D approach has to be preferred to the 2D in order to capture all patterns of convective flow, particularly in the case of planar high permeability regions such as faults.\nMagri, F., et al., 2014.

            "abstract": "The injection at depth of ice sheet runoff into fjords may be an important control on the frontal melt rate of tidewater glaciers. Runoff influences submarine melt rate directly, by generating buoyant plumes adjacent to the ice front, and indirectly, by influencing the circulation of heterogeneous water masses within the fjord. Understanding these processes has been held back, however, by the computational expense of modeling both the fine scale turbulent processes occurring within the buoyant plumes and the coarser scale circulation throughout the remainder of the fjord.\nHere, we develop a new parameterization for ice marginal plumes within the Massachusetts Institute of Technology General Circulation Model (MITgcm), allowing three-dimensional simulation of large (500 km2) glacial fjords on annual (or longer) timescales. We find that for an idealised fjord (without shelf-driven circulation), subglacial runoff produces a thin, strong and warm down-fjord current in the upper part of the water column, balanced by a thick and slow up-fjord current at greater depth. Submarine melt rates increase with runoff due to higher melt rates where the plume is in contact with the ice front. We find however that annual submarine melt rate across the ice front is relatively insensitive to variability in annual runoff. Better knowledge of the spatial distribution of runoff, controls on melt rate in those areas not directly in contact with plumes and feedback mechanisms linking submarine melting and iceberg calving are necessary to more fully understand the sensitivity of glacier mass balance to runoff-driven fjord circulation.",

            "abstract": "Multiple tropopauses (MT) defined by the World Meteorological Organization are frequently detected in autumn to spring at Syowa Station (69.0oS, 39.6oE). The dynamical mechanism of MT events was examined by observations of the PANSY radar, the first Mesosphere-Stratosphere-Troposphere radar in the Antarctic, and of radiosondes on 8–11 April 2013.\nThe MT structure above the first tropopause is composed of strong temperature fluctuations. By a detailed analysis of observed three-dimensional wind and temperature fluctuation components, it is shown that the phase and amplitude relations between these components are consistent with the theoretical characteristics of linear inertia-gravity waves (IGWs).\nNumerical simulations were performed by using a non-hydrostatic model. The simulated MT structures and IGW parameters agree well with the observation. In the analysis using the numerical simulation data, it is seen that IGWs were generated around (15oE, 65oS) and around (15oE, 70oS), propagated eastward, and reached the region above Syowa Station when the MT event was observed. These IGWs were likely radiated spontaneously from the upper tropospheric flow around (15oE, 65oS) and were forced by strong southerly surface winds over steep topography (15oE, 70oS). The MT occurrence is attributable to strong IGWs with low static stability in the polar winter lower stratosphere.\nIt is also shown that non-orographic gravity waves associated with the tropopause folding event contribute to 40% of the momentum fluxes, as shown by a gravity-wave resolving general circulation model in the lower stratosphere around 65oS. This result indicates that they are one of the key components for solving the cold-bias problem found in most climate models.",

Aiming to expand our parameterization capabilities for explosive eruption dynamics, we temporarily deployed in direct view of the active vents a range of imaging, acoustic, and seismic data acquisition systems.\nImaging systems included: two high-speed visible cameras acquiring synchronized images at 500 and 1000 frames per second (fps); two thermal infrared forward looking (FLIR) cameras zooming into the active vents and acquiring at 50-200 fps; two FLIR cameras acquiring at lower (3-50 fps) frame rates with a broader field of view; one visible time-lapse camera; one UV camera system for the measurement of sulphur dioxide emission; and one drone equipped with a camcorder.\nAcoustic systems included: four broadband microphones (range of tens of kHz to 0.1 Hz), two of them co-located with one of the high-speed cameras and one co-located with one of the seismometers (see below); and an acoustic microphone array. This array included sixteen microphones with a circular arrangement located on a steep slope above the active vents.\nSeismic systems included two broadband seismometers, one of them co-located with one of the high-speed cameras, and one co-located with one of the microphones.\nThe above systems were synchronized with a variety of methods, and temporarily added to the permanent monitoring networks already operating on the island. Observation focus was on pyroclast ejection processes extending from the shallow conduit, through their acceleration and interaction with the atmosphere, and to their dispersal and deposition. The 3-D distribution of bombs, the sources of jet noise in the explosions, the comparison between methods for estimating explosion properties, and the relations between erupted gas and magma volumes, are some examples of the processes targeted by the BAcIO.",

            "abstract": "Central Indian Ridge is located at the north of the Rodriguez Triple Junction and shows slow-intermediate spreading rate. The Kairei hydrothermal Field (KHF) was discovered in the first segment of Central Indian Ridge near the Rodriguez Triple Junction. The vent fluid which is extruding at the KHF has higher H2 content compared with other hydrothermal vent fluid in the world. Although The KHF itself exists above a basaltic rock massif, gabbro and mafic rocks were discovered on the seafloor around the KHF. These deep-seated rocks may contribute to the high H2concentration of the Kairei vent fluid .To understand how gabbro and mafic rocks are uplifted and exhumed on the seafloor, we conducted a seismic refraction/reflection survey using ocean bottom seismograms (OBSs). We conducted the seismic refraction/reflection survey from January 27 to March 19 in 2013 using S/V Yokosuka of Jamstec. In the experiment, we used 21 OBSs, an air gun (G.I.gun) and a single channel steamer cable. We obtained 5 survey lines NNW-SSE direction parallel to the ridge axis, 5 lines E-W direction and 5 lines NNE-SSW direction. In addition to these lines, we acquired other 5 lines passing through the point above the KHF or Yokoniwa Rise, which is the north of the KHF. In analysis of refraction data, firstly, we estimated 2D velocity model under survey lines, which are parallel to the ridge axis, using the progressive model development method developed by Sato and Kennett (2000). Then, we constructed a 3D initial model and run the 3D tomographic method developed by Zelt and Barton (1998). The 1D velocity profile of the KHF seems to be similar to that of mid ocean ridges such as Mid Atlantic Ridge, East Pacific Rise. Seismic velocities under the KHF and Yokoniwa Rise reach about 6km/s at depth of 1~2 km below seafloor, probably indicating uplift of deep-seated rocks. In this presentation we will show 3D seismic structure of this area.",

            "abstract": "CCS (Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage) is a promising option for mitigating climate changes. To predict the behavior of injected CO2 in a deep reservoir, relative permeability of supercritical CO2 and water of the reservoir rock is one of the most fundamental and influential properties. For determining the relative permeability, we employed the unsteady state method, in which the relative permeability is determined based on history matching of transient monitoring data with a multi-phase flow model. The unsteady-state method is relatively simple and short, but obviously its accuracy strongly depends on the flow model assumed in the history matching. In this study, we conducted relative permeability measurements of supercritical CO2-water system for Berea sandstone with the unsteady-state method under a reservoir condition at a 1km depth (P= 9.5MPa, T = 44˚C). Automatic history matching was performed with an inversion simulator iTOUGH2/ECO2N for multi-phase flow system of supercritical CO2, NaCl, and water. A sensitivity analysis of relative permeability parameters for CO2 and water was carried out to better understand the uniqueness and the uncertainty of the optimum solution estimated by the history matching. Among the parameters of the Corey-type curve employed in this study, while the end-point permeability could be optimized in a limited range, the other parameters were correlated and their combinations were not unique. However it was found that any combination of these parameters results in nearly identical shapes of the curve in the range of CO2 saturation in this study (0 to 60%). The optimally estimated curve from the unsteady-method was well comparable with those from the steady-state method acquired in the previous studies. Our experiment also focuses on the impact of injection rate on the estimates of relative permeability, as it is known that the injection rate could have a significant effect on fluid distribution such as viscous fingering with changes in the ratio of the viscous to the capillary forces (i.e., capillary number). It was found that the higher the injection rate, the more likely the increase of the relative permeability, suggesting that careful considerations should be given to the impact in injection rate on the estimates of relative permeability.",

            "abstract": "The interannual variability of the circulation and water mass formation in the Red Sea is investigated with the use of a numerical model and the combination of satellite and in-situ observations. The response of Red Sea to the large-scale variability of atmospheric forcing is studied through a 30-years simulation experiment, using MICOM model. The modeling results demonstrate significant trends and variability that are mainly located in the central and northern parts of the basin. On the other hand, the exchange pattern between the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean at the strait of Bab el Mandeb presents very weak interannual variability. The results verify the regularity of the water mass formation processes in the northern Red Sea but also show significant variability of the circulation and thermohaline conditions in the areas of formation. Enhanced water mass formation conditions are observed during specific years of the simulation (approximately five years apart). Analysis of recent warm and cold events in the northernmost part of the basin, based on a combination of atmospheric reanalysis results and oceanic satellite and in-situ observations, shows the importance of the cyclonic gyre that is prevailing in this part of the basin. This gyre can effectively influence the sea surface temperature (SST) and intensify or mitigate the winter effect of the atmospheric forcing. Upwelling induced by persistent periods of the gyre functioning drops the SST over the northernmost part of the Red Sea and can produce colder than normal winter SST even without extreme atmospheric forcing. These mechanisms are crucial for the formation of intermediate and deep water masses in the Red Sea and the strength of the subsequent thermohaline cells.",

            "abstract": "Terpenes show high reactivity in the troposphere, contributing to organic aerosol reactions with OH radicals. One of the main sources of terpenes in the atmosphere is terrestrial plants. It has been recently reported that marine phytoplankton also produce monoterpenes (Yassaa et al: 2008). Because aerosol production of natural origin affects the cloud cover over the open ocean, it is important to investigate the origin of aerosol generation in the open ocean. In this study, we investigated the production of terpenes and isoprene with a focus on Chlamydomonas (Chlorophyceae) and Rhodella maculata (Rhodophyta). Concentrations of terpenes and isoprene were measured using a dynamic headspace (GERSTEL DHS)—gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890N)—mass spectrometer (Agilent 5975C). In addition, chlorophyll a was measured using a fluorometer (Turner TD-700). The results showed that isoprene, α-pinene, and β-pinene were produced by Chlamydomonas sp. and that isoprene, limonene, and camphene were produced by Rhodella maculata. Chlamydomonas sp. produced α-pinene and β-pinene, similar to land plants. The ratio of the pinene/isoprene concentrations in the atmosphere over seawater where phytoplankton are blooming has been reported as approximately 0.7 (Yassaa et al: 2008). In this experiment, the pinene/isoprene concentration ratios in the cultures were approximately 0.1. This result indicates that marine phytoplankton may not be ignored in the marine atmosphere chemistry of terpenes.",

            "abstract": "The Kamojang Geothermal Field (KGF) is a typical vapor dominated hydrothermal system in West Java, Indonesia. This geothermal field is the oldest exploited geothermal field in Indonesia. From 1983 to 2005, more than 160 million tons of steam have been exploited from the KGF and more than 30 million tons of water were injected into the reservoir system. The injected water come from condensed water, local river and ground water.\nSustainable production in the geothermal energy development is the ability of the production system applied to sustain the stable production level over long times and to manage the mass balance between production, injection and natural recharge in the geothermal reservoir during exploitation. Mass balance in the reservoir system can be monitored by using time lapse gravity monitoring. Mass variation of hydrodynamic in the reservoir of KGF from 1999 to 2005 is about −3.34 Mt/year while is about −3.78 Mt/year from 1999 to 2008. Another period between 2009 and 2010, mass variation decreased about −8.24 Mt. According to the history of production and injection, natural recharge to the KGF’s reservoir is estimated at about 2.77 Mt/year from 1999 to 2005 and 2.75 Mt/year from 1999 to 2008. Between 2009 and 2010, KGF has a bigger mass deficiency rate throughout 200 MWe maintain production.\nLarge amount of fresh water is needed for sustainable geothermal energy production, while the domestic water supply need is also increased. Natural recharge, about 50% of injected water, cooling system, drilling and other production activities in KGF spend large amounts of fresh water. Water consumption for local people around KGF is about 1.46 MT/year. The water volume around KGF of total runoff is the range between dry season 0.07 MT/month and rainy season 4.4 MT/month. The water demands for sustainable geothermal production of KGF and for local people's consumption will increase in the future. Integrated planning between the energy and water sectors in KGF therefore will be essential to meet rising demands for both resources.\nKeywords: Gravity monitoring, Sustainable energy development, Water supply\nThe first author acknowledges this research activity was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 25.03068.",

This experiment measures the potential of wave energy in Hoi Ha Wan Marine Park, Hong Kong using a data buoy programmed to send data through wireless internet every five minutes.\nWave power (known as ‘wave energy flux’) is proportional to wave energy periodicity and to the square of wave height, and can be calculated using the equation:\nP = 0.5 kW/(m3)(s) x Hs2 x Tp\n P = wave energy flux (wave energy per unit of wave crest length in kW/m)\nHs = significant wave height (m)\nTp = wave period (seconds)\n Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs), or ultrasonic sensors, were installed on the seabed at three monitoring locations to measure Significant Wave Heights (Hs), Significant Wave Periods (Tp) and Significant Wave Direction (Wd). Over a twelve month monitoring period, Significant Wave Heights ranged from 0 ~ 8.63m. Yearly averages were 1.051m. Significant Wave Period ranged from 0 ~ 14.9s. Yearly averages were 6.846s. The maximum wave energy amount recorded was 487.824 kW/m. These results implied that electricity sufficient to power a small marine research center could be supplied by a generator running at 30% efficiency or greater.\nA wave piston driven generator prototype was designed that could meet output objectives without using complex hydraulics, expensive mechanical linkages, or heavy floating buoys that might have an adverse impact on marine life. The result was a design comprising a water piston connected by an air pipe to a rotary turbine powered generator. A specially designed air valve allowed oscillating bidirectional airflow generated in the piston to be converted into unidirectional flow through the turbine, minimizing kinetic energy loss. A 35cm wave with a one second period could generate 139.430W of electricity, with an efficiency of 37.6%.",

            "abstract": "Melting phase diagram of iron–light-element system is helpful to identify the light component in the core. If the outer core contains a single light element and the relevant binary phase diagram has a eutectic point, the core composition must lie on the iron-rich side of the eutectic. The eutectic liquid compositions in such binary systems have been examined at high pressure in a diamond-anvil cell (DAC), based on the disappearance of one of solid phases from in-situ X-ray diffraction patterns (e.g., Seagle et al., 2008 EPSL for Fe–FeO; Morard et al., 2008 EPSL for Fe–Fe3S). However, the loss of a given solid phase from the X-ray diffraction pattern does not necessarily mean its disappearance from a sample but is sometimes caused by extensive grain growth. And, it is difficult to eliminate a solid phase when axial temperature gradient is strong in a laser-heated sample. Alternatively, ex-situ textual and chemical characterization of a DAC sample could provide more solid information on the compositions of quenched liquid and coexisting solid. Here we estimated the eutectic liquid composition and the difference in silicon abundance in coexisting liquid and solid in an iron-rich portion of the Fe-FeSi binary system at high pressures to 134 GPa. Partially melted samples (Fe with 2, 4, 6.5, and 9 wt.% Si) were recovered from a DAC, and then examined with dual beam scanning microprobe (FIB + FE-SEM) (Versa 3DTM, FEI) or field-emission-type electron probe microanalyzer (FE-EPMA) (JXA-8530F, JEOL). The X-ray map of Si demonstrated the differentiation of silicon between coexisting liquid and solid phases quantitatively. The results demonstrate that the Si content in eutectic liquid decreases rapidly with increasing pressure. If the outer core includes ~12 wt.% Si as a single light element, it crystallizes the CsCl-type (B2) phase that is more enriched in silicon than coexisting liquid. Therefore, silicon cannot be the sole light component in the core, although its presence is strongly supported by Si isotopic composition as well as Mg/Si ratio of the mantle.",

            "abstract": "Numerous studies have addressed various aspects of the East African Rift system but surprisingly few on the offshore continuation of the south-eastern branch of the rift into the Mozambique Channel. The most prominent article has been published almost 30 years ago by Mougenot et al. (1986) and is based on vintage seismic data. Several studies investigating earthquakes and plate motions from GPS measurements reveal recent deformation along the offshore branch of the East African Rift system. Slip vectors from earthquakes data in Mozambique’s offshore basins show a consistent NE direction. Fault plane solutions reveal ~ E-W extensional failure with focal depth clustering around 19 km and 40 km, respectively.\nHere, we present new evidence for neotectonic deformation derived from modern seismic reflection data and supported by additional geophysical data. The modern rift system obviously reactivates structures from the disintegration of eastern Gondwana.\nDuring the Jurassic/Cretaceous opening of the Somali and Mozambique Basins, Madagascar moved southwards along a major shear zone, to its present position. Since the Miocene, parts of the shear zone became reactivated and structurally overprinted by the East African rift system. The Kerimbas Graben offshore northern Mozambique is the most prominent manifestation of recent extensional deformation. Bathymetry data shows that it deepens northwards, with approximately 700 m downthrown on the eastern shoulder. The graben can be subdivided into four subbasins by crosscutting structural lineaments with a NW-SE trend. Together with the N-S striking graben-bounding faults, this resembles a conjugate fault system. In seismic reflection data normal faulting is distinct not only at the earthquake epicenters. The faults cut through the sedimentary successions and typically reach the seafloor, indicating ongoing recent deformation.\n",

Previous field and laboratory campaigns have suggested that mineral dust present in the atmosphere act as IN at temperatures around -20°C (e.g. Sassen et al. 2003), however the cause of ice nucleation at temperatures of around -5°C is less certain. Coupled with the limited representation of aerosol and cloud processes in large-scale weather and climate models, the need for improved in-situ measurements of aerosol properties and cloud micro-physical processes to drive the improvement of aerosol-clouds processes in models is evident.\nAs part of the Ice NUcleation Process Investigation and Quantification (INUPIAQ) project, two field campaigns were conducted in early 2013 and early 2014. Both campaigns included measurements of cloud micro-physical properties at the summit of Jungfraujoch in Switzerland (3580m asl). Using data from the 2013 campaign and modelling simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF), an upwind site, located at Schilthorn (2970m asl), was determined for measuring aerosol properties out of cloud during the 2014 campaign. Further measurements of the cloud and aerosols properties were taken remotely using a doppler LiDAR located at Kleine Scheidegg (2061m asl).\nThe aim of this project is to determine whether detailed aerosol information is important to determining cloud and precipitation properties downwind. To this end WRF was run using the aerosol number concentrations and size distributions measured at the Schilthorn site to compare modelled ice number concentrations with measurements taken at Jungfraujoch using state of the science cloud ice probes, including the Three-View Cloud Particle Imager (3V-CPI) and the Cloud Aerosol Spectrometer with Depolarization (CAS-DPOL), with the results of the comparison presented and discussed at this meeting.\n",

From these estimates, ice sheet wide elevation changes were estimated using both the plane fitting principles and satellite crossovers. The accuracy of the results are evaluated using airborne NASA ATM and ESA CryoVEx data. The resulting elevation changes were then compared to results derived from Envisat and GRACE data. The results obtained are in line with previous observed spatial patterns of elevation change, where a clear negative signal can be detected along the ice sheet margins which decreases inwards to interior of the ice sheet, and confirms the dynamic behavior of the major outlet glaciers.",

            "abstract": "On August 15, 2013, a small jökulhlaup occurred when the Gingissig ice-dammed lake was drained at Kverkfjöll, a central volcano with an active geothermal area located at the northern edge of Vatnajökull. Coincidentally after the lake level drop of about 30 m, steam-driven explosions took place at the bottom of the drained lake. The explosions involved the surficial part of a hydrothermally altered glacio-lacustrine deposit mainly composed of pyroclasts, lava fragments and volcanic bombs, interbedded with clay-rich layers. Small fans of ejecta were formed, reaching a distance of 1 km north of the lake covering an area of about 0.3 km2, with a maximum thickness of 40 cm at the crater walls.\nThe explosions were triggered by the abrupt decrease in confining pressure as a consequence to the sudden drainage of the lake which caused rapid boiling in the surficial geothermal reservoir. The thermal and craterization energy, calculated for the explosion areas, is in the order of 1013 and 1011J respectively. Comparison of the calculated energies with the ones estimated by the volume of the ejecta and the crater sizes, indicates a good agreement between models and field data.\nMorphological analyses (SEM) suggest that fragmentation due to steam expansion within the vesicles affected a low percentage of the ejected material. Impact and abrasion features are significantly more frequent suggesting relatively low energy consumption by fragmentation, in contrast to a high energy transferred to the lifting and the launching of loose particles.\nDecompression experiments were performed in the lab mimicking the conditions due to the lake drainage. Then ejection velocities of the gas–particle mixtures were measured trough image analysis of high-speed videos and used to estimate the kinetic energy release.\nThe aim of this study was to combine field and lab data with theoretical modeling to give a robust constraint on the energies released by low-magnitude steam-explosion event.",

            "abstract": "Monoclinic pyrrhotite (Fe7S8) is a common ferrimagnetic mineral in both terrestrial rocks and meteorites (e.g., SNC, Rumuruti chondrites…). It is also recognized as a candidate magnetic mineral for Martian magnetic anomalies. We synthesized SD-like monoclinic pyrrhotite at 245°C using the molten-salt synthesis method [1]. Here we characterize its magnetic properties including its behavior under hydrostatic pressure up to 1.8 GPa. Data were collected in the 10K to 360°C temperature range and include measurements of low-field magnetic susceptibility (χ0), thermomagnetic curves χ0(T), major hysteresis loops, back-field remanence demagnetization curves, first-order reversal curve (FORC), alternating field and pressure demagnetization of saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM or Mrs), low temperature MPMS datasets (field and frequency dependencies of χ0, field-cooled and zero-field-cooled remanence FC-ZFC and room temperature SIRM heating-cooling cycles) as well as X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra. χ0(T) indicates a single Curie point at 320°C characteristic of monoclinic pyrrhotite.\nFor application of hydrostatic pressure up to 1.8 GPa we used a nonmagnetic high-pressure cell of piston-cylinder type entirely made of “Russian alloy” (Ni57Cr40Al3) with 8 mm of inner diameter similar to the cell, described in [2]. Application of 1.8 GPa resulted in demagnetization (decrease in SIRM) of the sample by 38%. Repeated cycling from 1.8 GPa to atmospheric pressure and back resulted in further decrease in remanence by 44% (for 3 cycles). The characteristic Besnus transition of pyrrhotite is observed at ~34 K. The observed hysteresis parameters (Mrs/Ms=0.53, Bcr/Bc=1.17, Bcr=41 mT, where Ms is saturation magnetization, Bc and Bcr are coercivity and remanent coercivity, respectively) are consistent with pseudo-single-domain range, previously established in literature [3]. Superparamagnetic (SP) grains are not present in the sample as no frequency dependence of χ0 is observed. ",

Understanding volatiles incorporation in magmas and their effect on the melt’s structure can be approached by in situ characterizations such as X-ray diffraction or Raman spectroscopy.\nHere, we focus on Xenon (Xe) in order to constrain its past and modern geochemical cycles. Indeed the 129I/129Xe extinct isotopic system is used to constrain planetary and atmosphere formation models. Moreover, some studies propose that Xe is currently recycled from the atmosphere to the mantle.\nTo study the solubility of Xe in silicate melts, we have performed in situ X-ray diffraction experiments on the synchrotron beam line P02 in PetraIII (DESY, Hamburg). Experiments were carried out using resistive heating diamond-anvil cells up to 7 GPa and 1300°C. Two compositions have been studied: a hydrous haplogranite (HPG) reference and a hydrous HPG doped with Xe. This composition is a magma analogue that is extremely well documented by petrological studies. Xenon can be identified on the radial distribution functions obtained by processing the x-ray diffraction data. Solubility mechanisms of Xe in silicate melts at depth will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Among the space weather effects due to gradual solar storms, greatly enhanced high-energy ion fluxes can cause radiation damage to satellites, spacecraft, and astronauts, which motivates examination of the transport of high-energy solar ions to Earth orbit. Ions of low kinetic energy (up to\n∼2\nMeV/nucleon) from impulsive solar events exhibit abrupt changes due to filamentation of magnetic connection from the Sun, indicating that anisotropic, field-aligned magnetic flux tube-like structures persist to Earth orbit. By employing a corresponding spherical two-component model of Alfv\\’enic (slab) and 2D magnetic fluctuations to trace simulated trajectories in the solar wind, we show that the distribution of high-energy (\nE≥1\nGeV) protons from gradual solar events is squeezed toward magnetic flux structures with a specific polarity due to the conical shape of the flux structures, which results from the expanding flow of the solar wind. It is difficult to observationally determine what polarity of flux structure the Earth is in at a given time, so this transport phenomenon contributes to event-to-event variability in ground level enhancements of GeV-range ions from solar storms, presenting a fundamental uncertainty in space weather prediction.

            "abstract": "Slope aspect has an important effect on spatial distribution of forest. As for forest on Tianshan Mountains, previous studies have focused mainly on the simple comparison between northern flank and southern flank in macro scale. However, there is little quantitative analysis on the distribution of mountain forest varying with slope aspects in local scale in northern flank. This paper explores how the upper and lower limits of altitude and the area of mountain coniferous forest vary with aspect in the northern flank of the central Tianshan Mountains. The spatial information of mountain coniferous forest and slope aspects are extracted respectively from SPOT5 image and 1:50,000 DEM. The results are shown as follows: (1) 98.6% of coniferous forest distribute from 1500 to 2700 meters above sea level. The average upper and lower limits of altitude of mountain coniferous forest are respectively 2730m and 1519m. The forest area has a U shaped pattern along 0-360˚ slope aspects. The area of forest on the shady slope is largest while on the sunny slope is smallest and this distribution is similar to that in macro scale. The area of forest on the western slope is larger than on the eastern slope. (2) The upper and lower limits of altitude of mountain coniferous forest vary little with aspects. The upper limit of altitude is slightly higher on the eastern slope and slightly lower on the western slope. The highest upper limit of altitude of forest is 2790m on the eastern slope while the lowest upper limit of altitude is 2691m on the western southwestern slope. There is no significant exposure effect on treeline elevation in local scale, which is different from that in macro scale.(3) The forest area near the climatic tree line also has a U shaped pattern along 0-360˚ slope aspects, but there is a difference that the area of forest near tree line on the eastern slope is larger than on the western slope, which suggests eastern slope is more suitable for treeline update.",

            "abstract": "Braided-river aquifers represent a major source of water supply in inneralpine regions such as the Swiss Alps. In order to improve the protection of this resource or its consumers from any contaminant, one can use heterogeneous geological models and run flow and transport simulations to be able to predict contaminant migration and to quantify uncertainty. An important issue -due to field, time or money constraints- is that hydrogeological and geophysical information on the study site are often scarce. Meanwhile, analog study sites exist and can provide porosities and permeabilities from boreholes data, precise description and length scale characteristics of deposited structures from outcrops or Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) surveys and interpretations.\nHere we test a procedure that includes the integration of analog site data to build geological models based on different conceptual models to provide a prediction of a contaminant migration as well as its uncertainty. The exercise is performed on the dataset from the MAcro Dispersion Experiment (MADE) site in Columbus (USA). GPR lines from the MADE site and analog site informations are used to calibrate the geological model parameters. The different geological modeling approaches are based on Sequential Gaussian Simulations, Multiple-Point Statistics, pseudo-genetic algorithm or object-based algorithm. The quality of the predictions is evaluated by comparing the simulated plume characteristics to the MADE plume characteristics.\nPreliminary results show that the 4 different types of geological models display very different connectivity patterns. For this specific exercise, the object-based model produced the largest uncertainty space that seems to encapsulate the tracer measurements, whereas the other methods generated a narrower uncertainty space that lay away from the measurements. We address the impact of additional information on the relevance of the methods.",

This is a volcanic island in the northwestern rim of Kikai caldera. Iron- and silica-rich mounds (0.5-3m wide and 0.2-7m high) are developing with hydrothermal activity (pH=5.5, 50-60 degree Celsius), and there is high deposition rate of iron-oxides (33 cm/year). In this study, we analyzed samples (20-30 cm long) recovered from iron oxidized mounds at seafloor by the observation with CT scan, FE-SEM and thin-sectioned samples, and the chemical analysis with EDS, XRF, XRD and DNA, and found that the structure of mounds has unique information.\nEach mounds are formed two layers: blackish hard layer and brownish soft layer. The inside of samples is constructed from the aggregation of convex structure (3-4 cm) covered by hard layers as a rim. Petrographic observations indicate that both layers have filament-like forms, and the form in soft layer is perpendicular to that in the hard layer. The number of iron oxides particles observed on filament-like forms in soft layer increases toward hard layer. Hard layer consists of aggregation of bacillus-like form as the chain of particle (about 2 um). At soft layer, on the other hand, bacteria-like form with smaller particles (<0.5 um) is observed. Bacteria-like form could be classified into 3 types (helix, ribbon-like, twisted). Furthermore, hard layers consist of ferrihydrite and opal-A (Si: 26.8%, Fe: 56.0%) and soft one is composed by ferrihydrite, opal-A and silica mineral (Si: 36.5%, Fe: 43.5%). Mariprofundus ferrooxydansknown as iron-oxidizing bacteria belonging to Zeta-proteobacteria identified in this matter.\n Bacteria-like form is considered to be the stalk made by iron-oxidizing bacteria. Such neutrophilic iron-oxidizing bacteria prefers an environment of redox interface between hydrothermal water and seawater, and their activity made hard rim at outer soft layer. This high deposition rate of iron hydroxides probably derives from the chemical reaction of oxidizing ferrous to ferric around stalks of iron-oxidizing bacteria.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater is a resource for drinking water and hence needs to be protected from contaminations. However, many well catchments include an inventory of known and unknown risk sources which cannot be eliminated, especially in urban regions. As matter of risk control, all these risk sources should be monitored. A one-to-one monitoring situation for each risk source would lead to a cost explosion and is even impossible for unknown risk sources. However, smart optimization concepts could help to find promising low-cost monitoring network designs.\nIn this work we develop a concept to plan monitoring networks using multi-objective optimization. Our considered objectives are to maximize the probability of detecting all contaminations and the early warning time and to minimize the installation and operating costs of the monitoring network. A qualitative risk ranking is used to prioritize the known risk sources for monitoring. The unknown risk sources can neither be located nor ranked. Instead, we represent them by a virtual line of risk sources surrounding the production well.\nWe classify risk sources into four different categories: severe, medium and tolerable for known risk sources and an extra category for the unknown ones. With that, early warning time and detection probability become individual objectives for each risk class. Thus, decision makers can identify monitoring networks which are valid for controlling the top risk sources, and evaluate the capabilities (or search for least-cost upgrade) to also cover moderate, tolerable and unknown risk sources. Monitoring networks which are valid for the remaining risk also cover all other risk sources but the early-warning time suffers.\nThe data provided for the optimization algorithm are calculated in a preprocessing step by a flow and transport model. Uncertainties due to hydro(geo)logical phenomena are taken into account by Monte-Carlo simulations. To avoid numerical dispersion during the transport simulations we use the particle-tracking random walk method.",

Small aperture seismic arrays were deployed at sites of interest for a short period of time (several hours) in order to record ambient vibrations. Each measurement setup included a reference station, which was installed on a stable part close to the instability. Recorded ground motion is highly directional in the unstable parts of the rock slope, and significantly amplified with respect to stable areas. These effects are strongest at certain frequencies, which were identified as eigenfrequencies of the unstable rock mass. In most cases the directions of maximum amplification are perpendicular to open cracks and in good agreement with the deformation directions obtained by geodetic measurements. Such unique signatures might improve our understanding of slope structure and stability. Thus we link observed vibration characteristics with available results of detailed geological characterization. This is supported by numerical modeling of seismic wave propagation in fractured media with complex topography.\nFor example, a potential relation between eigenfrequencies and unstable rock mass volume is investigated.",

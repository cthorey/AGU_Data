            "abstract": "Millennial-scale fluctuations in climate conditions are commonly observed in Holocene paleoclimate archives, however the meaning of these variations including whether they might arise from internal or external forcing are still actively debated. Proxy evidence of millennial-scale variability is most clearly present in a few specific parts of the world (e.g. North Atlantic region), whereas a lack of evidence from many other regions may result from a lack of observations or a lack of signal. Here we present the first evidence for such variations in Arctic Alaska using sedimentological and geochemical analyses from Burial Lake (68.43°N, 159.17°W; 460 m above sea level) in the western Brooks Range. We measured biogenic silica (BSi), total organic carbon, total nitrogen, C/N ratios, dry bulk density, magnetic susceptibility and magnetic remanence measurements, and elemental abundances from scanning XRF and use radiocarbon dating on terrestrial macrofossils to establish age control. Large fluctuations in biogenic silica and related proxies at millennial time scales over the last 10,000 cal yr BP are attributed to changes in aquatic productivity, which is indirectly mediated by climate through changes in the duration of the ice-free growing season and the availability of limiting nutrients.\nSpectral and wavelet analysis of the BSi record indicates a significant 1,500-yr cycle (above 95% confidence) emerges by ~6,000 cal yr BP. Comparison of BSi with reconstructed total solar irradiance reveals a low correlation (r2 = 0.01), suggesting no direct solar forcing of aquatic productivity. A comparison with Northern Hemisphere wide records shows no consistent phase relationship between the timing of maxima/minima in our BSi record. These results are consistent with previous work showing a strong middle Holocene transition into a ~1500-yr cycle. Similar timing for the emergence of an ~1500-yr cycle are found in proxies sensitive to thermohaline circulation and deep water formation, suggesting a possible link with (North Atlantic) oceanic forcing. If this observation is valid, an ocean-atmosphere interaction is needed to transmit the 1,500-yr signal to the North Pacific and/or Arctic sectors to drive millennial-scale climate variability in the Alaskan Arctic.",

            "abstract": "The Sierra Nevada represents a cascading hydrologic cycle where snowpack, meadow aquifers, and streams are all hydrologically connected. Monitoring the water balance within high elevation meadows is vital in order to effectively quantify watershed scale storage dynamics, which support meadow ecological communities as well as downstream users. In this case, much of the San Francisco, CA water supply originates from the seasonally released snowmelt from high elevation meadows to downstream reservoirs. In previous studies of high elevation meadows, the water mass balance was closed under the assumption that the meadow sediment was spatially uniform in thickness. Here, complex aquifer geometry was identified in Tuolumne Meadows, CA from a high-resolution ground-penetrating radar survey. This new geometry was compared to the previous geologic model of high elevation meadow aquifers using numerical models simulating both current and future snowmelt scenarios. In addition, the impact of variability in meadow sediment and slope were evaluated to quantify storage properties of representative Sierra Nevada meadow types. Results demonstrate that the previous aquifer geometry model significantly overestimates both the spatial and temporal volumetric storage and release of groundwater to streams. These implications are noteworthy for ecosystem restoration and water supply strategies that aim to rectify water supply to and from these meadows especially when considering drought scenarios. In order to move forward and effectively and efficiently monitor the seasonal volume of water stored within the Sierra Nevada, complex aquifer geometry within high elevation meadows must be considered.",

            "abstract": "The equatorial region of Jupiter is dynamically special because its rapid rotation exerts the strongest control on the fluid motion there through the largest boundary curvature. Magnetic braking and stable stratification have negligible effects on the equatorial zonal winds that would extend unimpeded through Jupiter in the direction parallel to the rotation axis. The Jovian gravitational field is also highly sensitive to the equatorial region because of its location in the non-spherical Jupiter. Based on an oblate spheroidal-shell model of a polytropic Jupiter with index unity, we calculate, via a perturbation approach using a fully three-dimensional finite element method, the gravitational signature produced by the Jovian equatorial zonal winds that are equatorially symmetric and confined within a small equatorial region that contains only 0.18 percent of the total Jovian mass. It is found that the equatorial winds alone largely determine the high-order gravitational coefficients whose values are thought to reflect the penetration depth of the zonal winds. In other words, the gravitational signature of the Jovian zonal winds is dominated by the equatorial zonal winds and nearly independent of the depth of the non-equatorial winds. This result has an important implication for the ongoing Juno mission which aims to resolve this long-term scientific puzzle about the depth of the Jovian zonal winds through its high-precision gravitational measurements.",

            "abstract": "The Fraser Island slide complex is located on eastern Australia's continental slope. Two potentially tsunamigenic submarine landslides identified here as the ‘North Fraser Island Upper Slope Slide’ (25km2 in area, 100m thick) and the ‘Middle Fraser Island Middle Slope Slide’ (12km2 in area, 50m thick) are described. Morphologic, sedimentologic and geomechanical properties for these slides are compared to data reported for existing submarine landslides located to the south in New South Wales (NSW). The two Fraser Island slides are translational, box-shaped, slab slides. We suspect that the slabs remained intact during downslope transport.\nThe upper slope slide is situated at a water depth of approximately 750m at the northern end of the Fraser Canyon complex. The head of this slide has apparently detached from a structural surface comprised of a Miocene reef complex located beneath the continental shelf edge. The middle slope slide is situated on a large plateau to the south of the Fraser Canyon complex in 1500m of water.\nCores taken in the continental slope within both slides are long and present hemipelagic muds. Cores taken adjacent to both slides are short and terminate in stiff muds of suspected Miocene or Pliocene age. Additionally, the core adjacent to the upper slope slide presents a near surface layer of upper-fining of coarse to fine shelly sand which we interpret to be a turbidite deposit. This layer was deposited above hemipelagic muds which are ubiquitously present on the upper eastern Australian continental slope in NSW and Southern Queensland.",

The Gwanghwamun site located at urban commercial area is 10 km apart from the Jungnang site located at urban residential area. The ABL height is determined by a height with a strong gradient of vertical backscatter intensity. It is found that the ABL height at both sites show a similar pattern and has a strong diurnal variation with a steep increase at 09-12 KST with a maximum in the late afternoon. And it is not determined clearly and the correlation between the ABL height by a ceilometer and that by an aerosol lidar is relatively low in case of high PM10 concentration such as Asian dust, haze and smog. Uncertainty of ABL height is also found to be strongly affected by the weather phenomena such as rain, haze or fog.",

In different segments, seismicity, slipping rates are obviously different. Studying the faulting mechanics in segments is important for understanding the rule of seismicity in this fault zone. With the earth interior structure, seismotectonics data, stress field and GPS data, rheology of the lithosphere as constraint conditions, we establish the three-dimensional finite element model of the Anninghe-Zemuhe-Xiaojiang fault zone. Faulting mechanical characters in segments, including the fault inactive, locking, aseismic creeping, stick-slipping and the rupturing, et al., are specified with contact surfaces and weak zone materials in ADINA program; and multi-timescale method is adopted to analyze the rupture in seconds and secular fault creep in tens of thousands of years. Numerical simulation results of the stress, strain and slip rate are used to explore the relationship between earthquakes and the faulting zone activity, and reveal the mechanisms of the faulting mechanical characters in segments.",

            "abstract": "We have investigated the effect of the interaction among heat, fluid pressure and dilatancy on dynamic earthquake slip process. Our framework includes three nondimensional parameters, Su, Su’ and Ta. The parameter Su represents the relative dominance of the effect of inelastic pore creation on the fluid pressure change over that of shear heating, while Su’ is associated with the dominance of fluid flow effect over the effect of shear heating. The nondimensional parameter Ta describes the effect of the upper limit of inelastic porosity evolution. With the assumption Su’=0, two qualitatively different slip behaviors were found to occur: slip acceleration and spontaneous slip cessation. We have derived the analytical form of function G describing the boundary between the acceleration and spontaneous slip cessation domains on the space of the parameters Su and Ta. If G is positive (this means that the minimum slip velocity is positive), the acceleration occurs, while if G is negative, the slip ceases spontaneously. Physically important outcome here about the function G is that the boundary between the acceleration and spontaneous cessation domains is expressed by a straight line for Su>>1 and Ta>>1; the acceleration domain is above the straight line, whereas the spontaneous slip cassation domain is below the line. From the form of G, we obtain a result that the coefficient of the straight line is given by 1/v0*, where v0* is the normalized initial slip velocity. In addition, this outcome suggests that if φ∞ is smaller than a critical value φc, spontaneous cessation will not occur for any values of Su (>>1) and Ta (>>1) because there exists a relationship Ta = φc/(φ∞ v0*) Su and the straight line describing this relationship and the boundary on the plane do not cross each other if the condition φ∞ < φc is satisfied. For future slip behavior, comparison of φ∞ with φc may give some implications whether the acceleration or cessation occurs.",

            "abstract": "We recently carried out the first integrated deep seismic experiment in the United Arabic Emirates (UAE) from the Arabian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman. Reflection data were acquired along 925 line km in the Arabian Gulf and Gulf of Oman using a large-volume airgun source (7060 cubic inches) and up to 5 km long streamer. Refraction data were acquired along selected reflection lines using 25 land recording stations in the UAE. In addition, gravity and magnetic anomaly data were acquired along all the seismic lines.\nThe objective of the seismic experiment is to determine the crust and mantle structure associated with UAE orogenic belt, the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Gulf. In addition, the experiment aims to determine mechanisms of ophiolite emplacement and the velocity structure of the crust and uppermost mantle beneath the orogenic belt and the flanking UAE foreland basin and offshore Furairah/Sharjah.\nPreliminary results of the experiment will be presented including initial findings of seismic reflection, refraction and potential field data. Seismic reflection data in the Gulf of Oman, for example, show evidence for post-rift and syn-rift sedimentation, tilted fault blocks and re-activated faults that appear to have offset the seafloor. Other findings include delineation, using gravity and magnetic data, of the offshore extent of the ophiolite, its thickness and the nature of its bounding faults.",

To understand how wind, temperature ,relative humidity and PHLH influence air pollution, WRF was used to simulate the meteorological condition of PBL during two heavy haze episodes in 2013. Combined with the local meteorological data and air pollution data, the analysis shows that cyclone is caused by the terrain of basin often. Air pollutants are limited in the basin and accumulate periodically. The concentration of O3 is significantly correlated with temperature while negatively correlated with relative humidity. There are significant negative correlations between the pollutants concentrations and the height of PBL. During the episode from 2nd to 23th March，the highest daily concentration of PM2.5 was 270ug/m3. The relativity between PM2.5 and O3 is lower than normal because of the dust storm. The correlation coefficients between O3 and temperature and relative humidity are 0.756 and -0.735, respectively. The dominant wind direction is south-west through the PBL. During the episode from 10th to 22nd April, the highest daily concentration of PM2.5 was 158ug/m3. The correlation coefficients between O3 and PM2.5, temperature, and relative humidity are 0.516, 0.825, -797, respectively. The dominant wind direction was south-west through PBL.",

            "abstract": "A series of 2-D sandbox experiments were conducted to investigate the infiltration behavior of dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPL) in saturated heterogeneous porous media. The modified light transmission (LT) method based on Bob et al. (2008) was used to quantify the DNAPL saturation during the infiltration process. A multiphase numerical simulator T2VOC was then used to simulate the experiments. With the EnKF method, static parameters such as permeability, porosity, residual NAPL saturation, and van Genutchen parameters (such as αnw and n), and dynamic variables like DNAPL saturation were continuously updated to match with the realtime observation data from LT method for history matching purposes. It is shown that the EnKF sometimes fails badly in the analysis (or updating) of saturations due to the nonlinearity between model variables and observable variables. Common sequential data assimilation algorithms based on the Kalman filter were also compared and discussed about the multiphase flow problem in porous media.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was financially supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China grants No. 41030746 and 41172206.\n",

            "abstract": "Recent progress in large scale computing by using waveform modeling technique and high performance computing facility has demonstrated possibilities to perform full-waveform inversion of three dimensional (3D) seismological structure inside the Earth. We apply the adjoint method (Liu and Tromp, 2006) to obtain 3D structure beneath Japanese Islands. First we implemented Spectral-Element Method to K-computer in Kobe, Japan. We have optimized SPECFEM3D_GLOBE (Komatitsch and Tromp, 2002) by using OpenMP so that the code fits hybrid architecture of K-computer. Now we could use 82,134 nodes of K-computer (657,072 cores) to compute synthetic waveform with about 1 sec accuracy for realistic 3D Earth model and its performance was 1.2 PFLOPS. We use this optimized SPECFEM3D_GLOBE code and take one chunk around Japanese Islands from global mesh and compute synthetic seismograms with accuracy of about 10 second. We use GAP-P2 mantle tomography model (Obayashi et al., 2009) as an initial 3D model and use as many broadband seismic stations available in this region as possible to perform inversion. We then use the time windows for body waves and surface waves to compute adjoint sources and calculate adjoint kernels for seismic structure. We have performed several iteration and obtained improved 3D structure beneath Japanese Islands. The result demonstrates that waveform misfits between observed and theoretical seismograms improves as the iteration proceeds. We now prepare to use much shorter period in our synthetic waveform computation and try to obtain seismic structure for basin scale model, such as Kanto basin, where there are dense seismic network and high seismic activity.

Exploring seafloor sulfide resources for industrial and scientific applications is a challenge. With the advent of geophysical surveys for seabed investigation, near-bottom magnetic prospecting, which yields shallow geological structure, is an efficient method for investigating active and inactive hydrothermal fields and for researching the structure of hydrothermal systems (Tivey et al., 1993, 1996；German et al., 2008).\nWe collected near-bottom magnetic data in the Longqi hydrothermal area, located in the southwest Indian ridge (49.6° E; Zhu et al., 2010; Tao et al., 2014), using the autonomous benthic explorer, an autonomous underwater vehicle, during the second leg of the Chinese cruise DY115-19 on board R/V DaYangYiHao. Based on the results of the intensity of the spatial differential vector method (Seaman et al., 1993), we outline the hydrothermal alternation zone. By building models, we subsequently infer a fault along the discovered hydrothermal vents; this fault line may be connected to a detachment fault (Zhao et al., 2013). In addition, we discuss the channels of the hydrothermal circulation system (Figure 1), and presume that heat was conducted to the sea subsurface by the detachment fault; the aqueous fluid that infiltrated the fault is heated and conveyed to the seafloor, promoting the circulation of the hydrothermal system.",

            "abstract": "Geofluids contain a large amount of silica, which solubility changes depending on temperature and pressure. Ubiquitous occurrences of various silica deposits (quartz veins, silica sinter, scales) suggest that silica precipitation plays an important role on temporal and spatial variation of hydrological properties of the Earth’s crusts. A pressure drop, for example, induced by seismicity, is one of the driving forces for silica precipitation within the crusts. In spite of the importance of silica depositions in fractures, how porosity and permeability evolution during silica precipitation is still poorly understood.\nIn this study, we conducted the hydrothermal experiments for silica precipitation from supersaturated solutions in vapor (370˚C, 20 MPa) and supercritical (420 ˚C, 30 MPa) conditions with flow rate of 1 g/min. After the experiments, we analyzed the 3-D porosity structures by X-ray CT, and then by making thin section. We developed a tube-in-tube vessel, which is composed of main vessel (made of SUS316), and inner alumina tube (6 mm inner diameter), to make a horizontal flow path. We did not used rock/mineral substrates, and alumina balls (1 mm diameter) are closely packed in the inner tube.\nIn both situations, a significant amount of silica deposited within a week, showing contrasting porosity structures between vapor and supercritical conditions. In vapor conditions, the precipitates are fine-grained quartz aggregate, and the most deposited at around 38 mm from the inlet. The pores were filled from the bottom to the top in the tube. In contrast, in the supercritical conditions, the precipitates are composites of amorphous silica and quartz; which accumulated around the alumina balls uniformly. Quartz grains are formed in amorphous silica layers, and the most porosity reduction occurred at around 25 mm from the inlet. A simple model of cellular automaton involving particle flow, adsorption, settling and deposition reveals that the relative magnitude of gravitational settling and adsorption controls the contrasting porosity pattern. Amorphous silica could be transport in long distance and adsorbed uniformly on the wall, whereas quartz grains nucleated in vapor immediately settled on the bottom, which could generate the contrasting vein textures.",

            "abstract": "The analysis of the seismic ambient noise field has recently received increased attention owing to its success in mapping the Earth’s shallow and deep structures. The origin of the passive seismic wavefield is associated with deep ocean and coastal regions where ocean waves, under certain conditions, can excite seismic waves (microseisms) that propagate as surface and body waves.\nPrevious seismological studies mainly focused on the observation of the strongest microseisms that are associated with the frequency range 0.1-0.3Hz. In our study, we focus on short period microseisms (0.325-0.725Hz) and examine the frequency dependant wave field and temporal variations over two decades. We use data recorded over two decades (1991-2012) from the Warramunga array (WRA) in central Australia. The analysis is carried out using IAS Capon beamforming that shows robust estimates of slowness and backazimuth, and is able to resolve multiple wave arrivals. Continuous data records are divided into one hour long recordings and evaluated for multiple arrivals in 8 separate frequency bands. We find multiple surface and body wave sources, which display seasonality and frequency dependence and remain stationary for two decades. We observe, for surface waves, that Rayleigh waves dominate for low frequencies while higher frequencies show a transition to leaky Rayleigh waves. The strong stationarity of the signal over multiple years, supports the suggestion that bathymetry and other site effects, such as coast line geometry, create favourable conditions for the generation of ocean induced surface waves. For body waves, source locations are identified in deep ocean regions for low frequencies and in shallow waters for higher frequencies. We further discuss correlation between arrivals and a WAVEWATCH III ocean wave hindcast for strong events.\nFig 1: a) Shows the slowness of strongest incoming arrivals for 1 hour of WRA data over two decades. b) Displays the surface waves paths of incoming Rayleigh (red) and leaky Rayleigh (blue) waves. c) Shows source locations from back projected body wave arrivals.",

            "abstract": "The complicated tectonic environment such as Taiwan region can modulate the seismic waveform severely and hamper the discrimination and the utilization of later phases. Restricted to the use of only first arrivals of P- and S-wave, the travel-time tomographic models of Taiwan can simulate the seismic waveform barely to a frequency of 0.2 Hz to date. While it has been sufficient for long-period studies, e.g. source inversion, this frequency band is still far from the applications to the community and high-resolution studies. To achieve a higher-frequency simulation, more data and the considerations of off-path and finite-frequency effects are necessary. Based on the spectral-element and the adjoint method recently developed, we prepared 94 MW 3.5-6.0 earthquakes with well-defined location and focal mechanism solutions from Real-Time Moment Tensor Monitoring System (RMT), and preformed an iterative gradient-based inversion employing waveform modeling and finite-frequency measurements of adjoint method. By which the 3-D sensitivity kernels are taken into account realistically and the full waveform information are naturally sought, without a need of any phase pick. A preliminary model m003 using 10-50 sec data was demonstrated and compared with previous travel-time models. The primary difference appears in the mountainous area, where the previous travel-time model may underestimate the S-wave speed in the upper crust, but overestimates in the lower crust.",

            "abstract": "Ten sediment samples collected from one acidic and three alkaline high temperature hot springs at Tengchong terrestrial geothermal field, Southwest China, were examined by the mineralogical, geochemical, and molecular biological techniques. The mineralogical and geochemical analyses suggested that these hot springs contain relative high concentrations of S, Fe and N chemical species. Specifically, the acidic hot spring was rich in Fe2+, SO42− and NH4+, while the alkaline hot springs were high in NO3-, H2S and S2O3−. Analyses of 16S rRNA sequences showed their bacterial communities were dominated by Aquificae, Cyanobacteria, Deinococci-Thermus, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Thermodesulfobacteria, while the archeal clone libraries were dominated by Desulfurococcales, Sulfolobales, and Thermoproteales. Among them, the potential S-, N- and Fe-related oxidizing and reducing prokaryote were presenting as a relative high proportion but with a great difference in diversity and metabolic approaches of each sample. These findings provide some significant implications for the microbial function in element biogeochemical cycles within the Tengchong geothermal environments: i). the distinct differences in abundance and diversity of microbial communities of geothermal sediments were related to in situ different physicochemical conditions; ii). the S-, N- and Fe-related prokaryote would take advantage of the strong chemical disequilibria in the hot springs; iii). in return, their metabolic activities can promote the transformation of S, Fe and N chemical species, thus founded the bases of biogeochemical cycles in the terrestrial geothermal environments.",

            "abstract": "In the magnetic exploration, it is meaningful to recover the distributions of total magnetization vector (TMV) since the distortions of remanence and self-demagnetization produce the similar responses that alter their magnitude and direction. We evaluate three approaches of magnetization vector inversion (MVI): (1) simultaneously inverting the TMV's three orthogonal components (MMM); (2) the magnitude, inclination and declination (MID); (3) orderly inverting the magnetization intensity, inclination and declination based on the transformed magnitude magnetic anomaly (M-ID). The primary implementation of MVI is to establish the symmetric positive definite matrix equations on the corrections of the model parameters and observed data sets. Then the optimal solutions are iteratively computed by use of the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm. We use the synthetic and real data sets to test these methods and the tests reveal that the isochronous MMM inversion aggravates the geophysical non-uniqueness problem and MID performs low stability of convergence due to the strong dependence on the starting models. While the sequential M-ID shows superior stability and precision of inverting the magnetization intensity and direction by making successive use of the amplitude and phase information of the magnetic anomaly. Finally, the achieved TMV distributions help us to investigate the influence of remanent magnetization and to recover the physical property distributions for high susceptibility when the self-demagnetization effect is not negligible.",

            "abstract": "Computational modeling of surface erosion processes is inherently difficult because of the four-dimensional nature of the problem and the multiple temporal and spatial scales that govern individual mechanisms. Landscapes are modified via surface and fluvial erosion and exhumation, each of which takes place over a range of time scales. Traditional field measurements of erosion/exhumation rates are scale dependent, often valid for a single point-wise location or averaging over large aerial extents and periods with intense and mild erosion. We present a method of remotely estimating erosion rates using a Bayesian hierarchical model based upon the stream power erosion law (SPEL). A Bayesian approach allows for estimating erosion rates using the deterministic relationship given by the SPEL and data on channel slopes and precipitation at the basin and sub-basin scale. The spatial scale associated with this framework is the elevation class, where each class is characterized by distinct morphologic behavior observed through different modes in the distribution of basin outlet elevations. Interestingly, the distributions of first-order outlets are similar in shape and extent to the distribution of precipitation events (i.e. individual storms) over a 14-year period between 1998-2011.\nWe demonstrate an application of the Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework for five basins and one intermontane basin located in the central Andes between 5S and 20S. Using remotely sensed data of current annual precipitation rates from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and topography from a high resolution (3 arc-seconds) digital elevation map (DEM), our erosion rate estimates are consistent with decadal-scale estimates based on landslide mapping and sediment flux observations and 1–2 orders of magnitude larger than most millennial and million year timescale estimates from thermochronology and cosmogenic nuclides.",

            "abstract": "We examine the climatological mean features of oceanic rings shed from the Kuroshio Extension jet and their interannual to decadal variability using satellite altimeter observations from October 1992 to December 2010. To objectively capture a ring shedding from the Kuroshio Extension jet, a new method that consists of the detection of the jet length changes and the tracking of a ring is proposed. A spatial distribution of the ring formations in the Kuroshio Extension region indicates that cyclonic (cold-core) rings were most frequently formed in the upstream region between 143°–147°E around the steady meander of the Kuroshio Extension jet. In contrast, most of anticyclonic (warm-core) rings formed in the downstream region west of the Shatsky Rise. These pinched-off rings in both the upstream and downstream regions generally propagate westward, but about two-third of the rings is reabsorbed by the jet. Nevertheless, about one-fourth of the meridional eddy heat transport at the latitude of the Kuroshio Extension results from the rings that are not reabsorbed by the jet. The number of ring formations shows substantial interannual to decadal variability. In the upstream and downstream Kuroshio Extension region, decadal and interannual variability is dominant, respectively. These fluctuations of the ring formations are negatively correlated with the strength of the Kuroshio Extension jet. It is also revealed that the ring formation variations play an important role in sea surface temperature changes north of the Kuroshio Extension jet.",

            "abstract": "The deep-sea carbonate rock is an important type of sedimentary rocks due to its effect on the composition of upper oceanic crust and contribution to the deep-sea geochemical cycles. However, the process and impact factor of deep-sea carbonate lithification at sea floor has remained a mystery for many years. Some deep-sea carbonate rocks characterized by active bioturbation and thrifty benthic faunas were collected from a large lithified area in 2008 approximately 50km west of the firstly discovered hydrothermal vent, blanketed on the ultraslow spreading Southwest Indian ridge (SWIR). Multidisciplinary approaches, including optical microscopy, scanning electronic microscopy and computerized X-ray tomography etc., were used to link the mineralization and activity of (micro)organisms that occur in this deep-sea carbonate rocks and to illuminate the geological and biological importance of deep-sea carbonate rocks on Mid-Ocean Ridges. Evidences are provided, for the first time, that deep-sea carbonate lithification is strongly influenced by bioturbation in this area. Active bioturbation provides a feasible pathway for the dissolution of original foraminiferal tests or coccolith plates and subsequently reprecipitation of calcite cements. Phylogenetic analysis by Li et al., (2014) revealed many sequence are closely related to the microorganisms involved in the N and S cycles. Such uncommon habitats for microbial communities may reflect the influence of direct volatile discharge (mainly composed of CO2, H2S, H2 and SO2) from underlying basaltic rocks. The active bioturbation and volatile discharge may trigger the dissolution of the original calcite above the saturation horizon, and thus drive deep-sea carbonate lithification on Mid-Ocean Ridges. Our results provide a novel mechanism for deep-sea carbonate lithification at deep-sea seafloor, and also suggest a special type of biospheres and geologic bodied on Mid-Ocean ridge systems.",

Ferromanganese crusts on Lemkein seamount in Marshall Islands also are phosphatized (3.3 to 4.2 wt % of P concentration). Furthermore, they have characteristic features that are different from other ferromanganese crusts. These features occur near the phosphorite, which were thought to fill the pore spaces of ferromanganese crusts. Inside the features, ferromanganese crusts are botryoidally precipitated from the round-boundary. The features of the phosphatized lower crusts of Lemkein seamount are observed using microscope and SEM. Elemental compositions of the selected samples were analyzed by SEM-EDS. Based on the observation and analysis of samples, three characteristic structures are identified: (1) phosphate-filled circles, (2) tongue-shaped framboidal crust, and (3) massive framboidal crust. The phosphate-filled circles are mostly composed of phosphorite, and they include trace fossils such as foraminifera. Phosphatized ferromanganese crusts exist at the boundary of this structure. The tongue-shaped crust is connected with the lips downward, and ferromanganese crusts inside the tongue show distinct growth rim. The massive framboidal crust is located below the tongue. Ferromanganese crusts in the massive framboidal crust are enveloped by phosphate, and some of the crusts are phosphatized. Around the structures, Mn oxide phase is concentrated as a shape of corona on BSE image. All of the structures are in the phosphatized crusts that show columnar growth of ferromanganese crusts and have sub-parallel lamination. These observation and chemical analysis of the ferromanganese crusts can provide a clue of diagenetic processes during the formation of ferromanganese crusts.",

            "abstract": "Due to its importance for global energy dissipation in the ionosphere, the diffuse aurora has been intensively studied in the past 40 years. Its origin (precipitation of 0.5-10 keV electrons from the plasma sheet without potential acceleration) has been generally attributed to whistler-mode chorus wave scattering in the inner magnetosphere (R<~8 RE), while the scattering mechanism beyond that distance remains unresolved. By modeling the quasi-linear diffusion of electrons with realistic parameters for the ambient magnetic field, loss-cone size and electrostatic electron cyclotron harmonic (ECH) wave intensity (obtained from THEMIS observations as a function of magnetospheric location), we estimate the loss-cone filling ratio and ECH wave-induced electron precipitation systematically throughout the entire data set, from 6 RE out to 31 RE (the THEMIS apogee). By comparing the wave-induced precipitation directly with the equatorially mapped energy flux distribution of diffuse aurora from ionospheric observations (OVATION Prime model) at low altitudes, we quantify the contribution of auroral energy flux from ECH wave scattering. Although the wave amplitudes drop, as expected, with distance from the Earth, due to the small loss cone size and stretched magnetic field topology, ECH waves are still capable of causing sufficient scattering of plasma sheet electrons to account for the observed diffuse auroral dissipation. Our results demonstrate that ECH waves are the dominant driver of diffuse aurora in the outer magnetosphere (beyond ~8 RE).",

            "abstract": "New constraints on the timing of the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction and the Chicxulub impact, together with a particularly voluminous and apparently brief eruptive pulse toward the end of the “main-stage” eruptions of the Deccan continental flood basalt province, suggest that these three events may have occurred within less than about a hundred thousand years of each other. Partial melting induced by the Chicxulub event does not provide an energetically-plausible explanation for this coincidence, and both geochronologic and magnetic-polarity data show that Deccan volcanism was underway well before Chicxulub/K-Pg time. However, historical data document that eruptions from existing volcanic systems can be triggered by earthquakes. Seismic modeling of the ground motion due to the Chicxulub impact suggests that the impact could have generated seismic energy densities of order 0.1-1.0 J/m3 throughout the upper ~200 km of the Earth’s mantle, sufficient to trigger volcanic eruptions worldwide based upon comparison with historical examples. Triggering may have been caused by a transient increase in the effective permeability of the existing deep magmatic system beneath the Deccan province, or mantle plume “head.” It is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that the Chicxulub impact might have triggered the enormous Poladpur, Ambenali, and Mahabaleshwar (Wai sub-group) lava flows that account for >70% of the Deccan Traps main-stage eruptions. This hypothesis is consistent with independent stratigraphic, geochronologic, geochemical, and tectonic constraints, which combine to indicate that at approximately Chicxulub/K-Pg time a huge pulse of mantle plume-derived magma passed through the crust with little interaction, and erupted to form the most extensive and voluminous lava flows known on Earth. High-precision radioisotopic dating of the main-phase Deccan flood basalt formations may be able either to confirm or reject this hypothesis, which in turn might help determine whether this singular outburst within the Deccan Traps (and possibly volcanic eruptions worldwide) contributed significantly to the K-Pg extinction.",

            "abstract": "Incidences of climatic extremes and associated crop failures in major food-producing regions have implications for commodity prices and generate concerns for national governments and commercial entities in import-dependent countries. While recent changes in temperature and precipitation extremes are evident, their impacts on the year-to-year variability of yield remain unclear. Here we present a global assessment of the impacts of recent climate change on year-to-year variations in yields of major crops using a global dataset of historical yields recently developed by merging satellite product and country-level crop statistics. We found that crop yield variability, in a large portion (24-53%) of the global harvested area, decreased from the earlier decade (1982—1993) to the later decade (1994—2005). However, yield variability also increased in a substantial portion (9—17%) of the harvested area. The changes in yield variability across 20—31% of the harvested area could be reasonably explained by changes in an agro-climatic index. Our findings reveal that climate change in the last two decades has led to more unstable yields in some regions. However, climate change has reduced yield variability in many more regions of the world. This suggests complex influences of climate change and agronomic technology on yield variability.",

            "abstract": "Enormous earthquakes repeatedly occur in subduction zones, and the slips along megathrusts, in particular those propagating to the toe of the forearc wedge, generate ruinous tsunamis. Quantitative evaluation of slip parameters (i.e., slip velocity, rise time and slip distance) of past slip events for the shallow, tsunamigenic part of the fault is critical to characterize such earthquakes. Here we attempt to quantify these parameters for slip events that occurred along the shallow part of a megasplay fault and a plate boundary décollement in the Nankai Trough, off southwest Japan, and two fossilized analogue faults, hosted in the Miura-Boso accretionary complex (Shirako and Emi fault: East of Japan). We applied a kinetic approach to profiles of vitrinite reflectance data intersected the slip planes of the thrusts. This approach consists of calculation of heat generation and numerical analysis of vitrinite reflectance data. For the purpose of obtaining optimal slip parameters, residue calculation for fitting is implemented. As the result, the measured distributions of vitrinite reflectance around Nankai megathrust are fitted when heat generation rate (Q) and slip duration (tr) are 16,600 J/s/m2 and 6,250 s for the megasplay, and 23,200 J/s/m2 and 2,350 s for the frontal décollement, implying slow and long-term slips. The results of numerical analyses on the measured data from the Shirako fault also indicate remarkable slow slips: slip velocity and slip distance of 0.14 cm/s and 5.17 m, respectively, under the optimal parameters set of Q = 14,500 J/s/m2 and tr = 3,600 s. For the Emi fault, however, the increasing in reflectance is limited only inside of the slip zone, and the calculate results shows the fast and short-time slip (~ 1 m/s and ~5m) has had occurred on this fault. This estimation is comparable to other chemical approach based on trace-element mobilization. These results show large variation of slip parameters in shallow part of subduction zone. Especially, slow slip velocity, long-term risetime and large displacement are recognized in the three fault zones (the megasplay, the frontal décollement and the Shirako fault). Estimated parameters are longer and slower than typical coseismic slip, but are rather consistent with rapid afterslip.",

            "abstract": "A rare and unique observation of electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves has been studied for the Cassini and WIND satellites during the Cassini Earth flyby on 18th August, 1999, across the Earth’s magnetosheath. Magnetic field data from Cassini and WIND for the time interval 0152-0226 UT are analyzed to characterize the wave modes when the satellites were present in the subsolar and dusk side magnetosheath, respectively. A new technique/program called Rosetta Automatic Wave Analysis (RAWA) has been developed based on the method initiated by Tsurutani et. al., 2013 to study the wave cycles. Various wave mode characteristics like frequency, ellipticity, propagation angle, and wave polarization are determined and are characterized statistically. Cassini and WIND wave cycle analysis suggest that almost all the waves (> 80%) were left hand circularly polarized waves with frequencies lying at or below the proton cyclotron frequency. This indicates abundance of ion (proton) cyclotron mode propagation in the Earth's magnetosheath for the aforementioned interval. No obvious mirror mode indications were found as there were no linearly polarized waves detected. The waves which were either right hand polarized or had frequencies greater than the proton cyclotron frequency were consistent with their being left hand waves with frequencies less than proton cyclotron frequency in the plasma frame. We thus conclude that the waves detected at both Cassini and WIND are electromagnetic left hand polarized proton cyclotron waves. There is no evidence of mode conversion to (plasma frame) right hand waves, even though the wave amplitudes are exceptionally large (10 nT). Majority of the waves were found to propagate parallel (<30o) to the ambient magnetic field and were circularly polarized. However it is also found that for waves propagating at oblique angles to B0, the polarization is still circular. This is not understood at this time. Proton cyclotron waves detected at Cassini and WIND were found to be quasi-coherent and compressive. The Earth's magnetosheath was found to have unusually low plasma beta (β=0.35) during the Cassini traversal which would have possibly favored the ion cyclotron modes over mirror modes.",

            "abstract": "The flow field may be affected by aquifer boundaries, when pumping in a small-scale aquifer or a long term pumping activity is required especially under a large pumping rate. Using potential theory, the image-well method and superposition principle, analytical solutions are derived for pumping in a fully bounded rectangular aquifer with five different boundary condition scenarios: (1) one constant-head boundary (in horizontal direction in plan view) and three impermeable boundaries, (2) two parallel constant-head boundaries (in horizontal direction) and two parallel impermeable boundaries (in vertical direction), (3) two pairs of orthogonal impermeable and constant-head boundaries, (4) three constant-head boundaries and one impermeable boundary, and (5) four constant-head boundaries. For each scenario, closed-form expressions are derived in three different types: (1) summation of the series in horizontal and vertical directions; (2) summation of the series in horizontal direction and exact potential in vertical direction, and (3) summation of the series in vertical direction and exact potential in horizontal direction. It is found that all the three types of closed-form expressions can produce an accurate potential for scenarios (3)-(5). For scenarios (1) and (2), by contrast, the third type closed-form expression can yield an accurate solution, while the second type close-form expression always generates an unacceptable solution. Therefore, the third type closed-form is recommended to solve the potential of a flow field created by a pumping well subjected to multiple impermeable and/or constant-head boundary conditions, due to its accuracy as well as computational efficiency.",

            "abstract": "Over temperate glaciers images obtained from ground-penetrating-radar (GPR) are often blurred because electromagnetic waves are scattered on water pockets or by complex glacial bed topography, or damped due to a higher overall water content within the glacier. A combination of seismic and GPR surveying can increase the data information content and aid interpretation of subsurface structure.\nIn September 2012 we acquired surface and borehole GPR and seismic data in the ablation zone of the Rhone Glacier located in central Switzerland. GPR data were acquired using antenna frequencies of 25, 50 and 100 MHz. Active reflection seismic data were recorded along a coincident profile across the glacier. Seismic waves were generated with small explosive sources spaced at 4m, and recorded on 30 Hz geophones at 2 m spacing. Both methods resulted in images showing a maximum depth of the glacier of approximately 130 m. However, the seismic image of the glacier bed was of much higher resolution and showed a clear primary reflection from the base, whereas the GPR image often showed several reflections of similar amplitude, above and from the bedrock interface, or no reflection at all. We interpreted a series of crenulations along the glacier bed reflector in the seismic image as melt water channels. This interpretation was supported by the intermittent nature of GPR glacier bed reflections, which are expected to be more sensitive to changes in water content than to the ice-rock interface.\nFirst break travel time inversions of the surface seismic data yielded velocities of 3320 m/s near the top of the glacier, and remarkably constant values of 3720 m/s at depths below 4.5m. However, travel time inversion of seismic data between boreholes which penetrated as far as the glacier bed, indicate a 3D anisotropy of seismic velocity, ranging from 3650 m/s horizontally across the glacier to 3850 m/s horizontally along the line of the glacier. Vertical seismic velocity was found to lie between these values. The seismic anisotropy is most likely caused by preferred c-axis orientations of the ice crystals.",

Rating curves, which allow the functional translation of stream water depth into discharge making them integral to water resource monitoring efforts, were modeled using a physics-based approach that captures basic geometric measurements to establish flow resistance due to implicit channel roughness. We tested synthetically thinned high-resolution airborne laser scanning data (topographic LiDAR data) as a proxy for low-resolution data at a point density equivalent to that obtained within most national-scale ALS strategies. Our results show that the errors incurred due to the effect of low-resolution versus high-resolution ALS data were less than those due to flow measurement and curve fitting uncertainties or uncertainty pertaining to vegetation densities. As such, although there still are some scale and technical limitations to consider, it appears theoretically possible to generate rating curves for any point in a river network from airborne laser scanning data of the resolution anticipated within national-scale ALS schemes. This would greatly enhance our ability to monitor streamflow globally by simplifying the effort required.",

            "abstract": "This study investigates the hydrologic responses to urbanization as well as the potential surface-atmosphere feedback related to urban processes. The shift of spatial rainfall patterns is a detectable overlying change induced by the feedback. A hypothetical urbanized watershed was configured by simplifying rainfall-runoff processes in real urban watersheds. Forty-eight scenarios were simulated with different spatial patterns of rainfall and impervious coverage considered. Hydrologic responses were analyzed with four metrics--flow distribution, daily variation, frequency of floods and interannual runoff variability, as well as the relative changes in flood magnitudes for different scenarios. Results indicate that the variations of four hydrologic metrics do not present monotonic trends with the increase of impervious coverage as described in previous studies, but depend on the spatial extent of urban coverage and the spatial patterns of rainfall. The largest hydrologic variations and relative changes of flood magnitudes occur when the watershed is moderately urbanized (with 20~30% impervious coverage). Changes in flood magnitudes induced by urbanization could be underestimated by almost 50% if the spatial rainfall patterns are not considered. We attribute the most detectable hydrologic variations to the heterogeneous properties of the underlying surface and the coincidence of spatial patterns of rainfall with impervious coverage. This study reassessed the hydrologic responses to urbanization considering both the changes of impervious coverage and spatial rainfall patterns, and highlighted the necessity of considering comprehensive assessments in future urban planning.",

            "abstract": "Lava lakes offer unique opportunities for understanding how magmatic volatiles physically escape from low-viscosity, vesicular magma in open-vent conditions, a process often referred to as magma outgassing. Large-scale lava convection movements and meter-scale bubble explosions, sometimes triggered by rock falls, are acknowledged outgassing processes but may not be the only ones.\nIn 2013 we used high-frequency (50-500 Hz) thermal and visible imaging to investigate the short-timescale dynamics of the currently active Halema`uma`u lava lake. At that time, besides the dominant release of large bubbles, three types of peculiar outgassing features were observed on the lava lake surface. The first, diffusely observed throughout the observation experiment, consisted of prolonged (up to seconds) gas venting from ‘spot vents’. These vents appeared to open and close without the ejection of material or bubble bursting, and were the site of hot gas emission. Spot vents were located both between and inside cooling plates, and followed the general circulation pattern together with the rest of the lava lake surface. The second feature, observed only once, consisted of the transient wobbling of the whole lava lake surface. This wobbling, with a wavelength of meters to tens of meters, was not related to any external trigger, and dampened soon without apparent consequences on the other lake dynamics. Finally, we observed large (meters) doming areas of the lake surface randomly fluctuating over seconds to minutes. These areas were either stationary or moved independently of the general lake surface circulation, and usually were not affected by other lake surface features (e.g., cooling plate boundaries).\nThese three features, though trivial for the overall lake outgassing, testify that the lava lake has a complex shallow subsurface architecture, in which permeable channels and gas pockets act independently of the more common bubble bursts.",

The relationship between fire and deforestation varies temporally and spatially according to the type of deforestation and climatic conditions. This study evaluates spatiotemporal variability between fire and deforestation over the 2002–2012 period in the Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA). We based our study on four datasets: deforestation estimates from PRODES (Amazon Deforestation Monitoring Project) and forest cover loss from the Global Forest Change (GFC) project based on Landsat data, and burned area and land cover based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data.\nWhile GFC and PRODES supported similar findings on spatial and temporal dynamics, the Landsat-scale comparison also highlighted a number of differences. Both datasets show a decrease after 2004 in forest loss or deforestation extent mainly from decreasing clearing rates in evergreen broadleaf forest, mostly in the states of Mato Grosso and Rondonia. However, the drop is larger and more gradual in PRODES than in GFC, with the former having less than half the forest loss of the latter. GFC indicates anomalous high forest loss in the years 2007 and 2010 not seen in PRODES. Rescaling these forest dynamics datasets to 500-meter resolution, allowed for a comparison against the MODIS datasets. The burned area data indicates that the mismatch between PRODES and GFC is largely related to increased fire occurrence during these dry years, mainly in Para. In addition it indicates that the time interval between deforestation and fire differs according to land cover, which is important when estimating the atmospheric impact of forest loss. We found that evergreen broadleaf forests are burned shortly after deforestation due to slash and burn techniques, while croplands have longer intervals depending on the crop variety. As a final step, we used these insights to better quantify carbon emissions from this region.",

J. Int., 2011; Hector et al., Geophys. J. Int., 2013). However some recent papers reported a disappointing potential of gravity measurements during a pumping experiment in a sandy aquifer (Blainey et al., WRR, 2007; Herckenrath et al., WRR, 2012) and their poor ability in constraining the transmissity and specific yield of the aquifer, which are the parameters to which pumping tests give access.\nFresh basement rocks present generally a null porosity and the structure of basement aquifers is given by the weathering profile. In tropical climate, this profile consists of a few tens meter thick saprolite layer, with noticeable porosity but low permeability overlying the weathering front. This weathering front includes in many instances a fractured medium and presents a high permeability with variable porosity. It is hardly sampled in coring experiments. We present some numerical simulation results on the ability of gravity to constrain the transmissivity of this medium. Due to poroelasticity of clay minerals in the saprolite, soil subsidence is expected to occur during pumping with a significant gravity effect. Gravity measurements have therefore to be completed with leveling data at a millimetric precision.\nWe present first the results of numerical modeling of the gravity and subsidence for a theoretical horizontally stratified basement aquifer, and show that gravity and leveling are able to provide independently the poroelasticity coefficient and a single transmissivity coefficient for the bottom of the aquifer, if the properties of the upper saprolites are known.\nWe will discuss then the general case, where the aquifer presents a vertical fracture where the weathering profile thickens.",

            "abstract": "The Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC, Liang et al., 1994) model has been used for a broad range of applications, in hydrology as well as in the fields of climate and global change. Calibration of the often distributed application of the model is difficult, certainly in the light of the ongoing discussion on applying global models at hyper-resolution (Wood et al., 2011). \nTo improve the calibration procedure for VIC applied at grid resolutions varying from meso-scale catchments to the 1 km ‘hyper’resolution now used in several global modeling studies, the parameters of the model are studied in more detail with specific focus on scale effects. A lumped VIC-model was constructed for three nested basins: the Rietholzbach (3.4 km2), Jonschwil (492 km2) and the Thur basin (1700 km2) in Switzerland. With the DELSA sensitivity analysis method (Rakovec et al., 2013) it was shown that parameter sensitivity does not change over scale. Extensive calibration of the lumped models using the DREAM algorithm (Vrugt et al., 2008) revealed that most of the calibrated parameter values of the three basins were within each others uncertainty bound based on the converged part of the posterior. This information was used for calibration of the distributed VIC models, which where constructed for the Thur basin at a grid resolution of 1x1 km, 5x5 km and 10x10 km.",

            "abstract": "Airborne electromagnetic (AEM) surveys are frequently used to delineate geological interfaces in the subsurface, such as the base of regolith or boundaries of an aquifer. However, inversion of AEM data is inherently non-unique, and estimating the robustness of models is often as important as finding a valid model. An example of this is groundwater modelling, where geological model uncertainty is one of the main sources of risk. In a Bayesian framework, Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) algorithms have been successful in mapping uncertainty in 1D model space corresponding to each AEM fiducial. But full McMC sampling for laterally-correlated models is computationally expensive, and independent 1D samplers are often the only feasible alternative. In these laterally independent 1D models, abrupt transverse changes in model parameters can occur, making it difficult to derive spatially coherent interfaces. By comparison, classically regularized deterministic inversions can take spatial correlation between 1D models into account, but provide little useful information about model uncertainty. Here we introduce a Bayesian parametric bootstrap approach to invert for layer properties, interfaces and related uncertainties, using a 1D kernel but incorporating lateral correlation. These methods treat Bayesian prior information on model uncertainty and its spatial correlation as implied observations, then apply the classical parametric bootstrap. Numerical examples demonstrate that our Bayesianized bootstrap will explore model space adequately for non-pathological situations, while requiring many fewer forward problem solves than a comparable McMC algorithm. Recovered uncertainties for synthetic data and field data exhibit the expected patterns; for example, we observe the well-known increase in uncertainty in interface depths with increasing depth to the interface. We believe the Bayesian parametric bootstrap offers an attractive and satisfactory compromise between efficiency and exhaustive search of model space for the derivation of spatially coherent models.",

            "abstract": "Drought events pose a substantial threat to water security in almost every climate zone and water use sector. Many countries have had difficulty maintaining water supplies and mitigating user conflicts during recent droughts, for example during Australia’s Millennium Drought (1998-2010) and the recent droughts in the USA (2012), Europe (early 2000s) and UK (2011/12). With climate projections suggesting that droughts will intensify in many regions, the magnitude of this threat is likely to increase and thus vulnerability of society to drought must be reduced through better preparedness. The Belmont Forum project DrIVER (Drought impacts: Vulnerability thresholds in monitoring and Early-warning Research) aims to contribute to better preparedness by improving links between natural (hydrometeorological) drought characterisation and environmental and socio-economic impacts. Better integration of drought characterisation and impacts are expected to lead to enhanced drought monitoring and early-warning systems and other risk management strategies. We present results from a comparison of the monitoring and early-warning capacity and past drought impacts in case studies on three continents, North America, Europe and Australia. All have high institutional capacity but are set within very different hydroclimatic conditions with differing drought vulnerabilities and management frameworks.",

The study covered a wide range of anthrophogenic N-deposition from south to north (max: 2 g m-2 yr-1, min: 0.1 g m-2 yr-1) as well as highly variable climate and catchment and lake properties. Inorganic N in lakes was positively correlated with N-deposition, while organic N was closely associated with allochthonous DOC. The ratio of NO3: total N as well as NO3: total P and NO3:SiO2 showed a strong variability, and most of this variability could be explained by N-deposition, terrestrial vegetation as inferred from NDVI, temperature, runoff and the fraction of bogs in the catchment. The “global change” induced changes in element concentrations and elemental ratios could profoundly affect the lake metabolism and community composition. By linking these data with downscaled climate change predictions we may also predict future shifts in element export and element ratios in various lakes with reasonable accuracy.",

It is assumed that the Manihiki Plateau was emplaced as the centerpiece of the “Super-LIP” Ontong Java Nui by multiple volcanic phases during the Cretaceous Magnetic Quiet Period. The subsequent break-up of Ontong Java Nui led to fragmentation of the Manihiki Plateau into three sub-plateaus, which all exhibit individual relicts of the “Super-LIP” break-up.\nWe examine two deep crustal seismic refraction/wide-angle reflection profiles crossing the two largest sub-plateaus of the Manihiki Plateau, the Western Plateaus and the High Plateau. Modeling of P- and S-wave velocities reveals surprising differences in the crustal structure between the two sub-plateaus. Whereas the High Plateau shows a constant crustal thickness of 20 km, relicts of multiple volcanic phases and break-up features at its margins, the model of the Western Plateaus reveals a crustal thickness decreasing from 17 km to only 9 km. There is only little evidence of secondary phases of volcanic activity. The main upper crustal structure on the Western Plateaus consists of fault systems and sedimentary basins.\nWe infer that the High Plateau experienced phases of strong secondary volcanism, and that tectonic deformation was limited to its edges. The Western Plateaus, on the contrary, were deformed by crustal stretching and underwent only little to no secondary volcanism. This indicates that the two main sub-plateaus of the Manihiki Plateau experienced a different geological history and have played their individual parts in the break-up history of Ontong Java Nui.",

Surface evaporation has little dependence on the horizontal resolution. Over western TP, precipitation shows a bi-modal seasonal cycle. In SPA and HPA, the primary (secondary) peak is in Jul.-Aug. (Mar.-Apr.), while two peaks have the same magnitude in LPA. A magnitude of the peak in spring becomes smaller as the horizontal resolution becomes finer. In eastern TP, precipitation has its annual maximum in July. In LPA, a larger positive precipitation bias than that in SPA and HPA is explained by a larger positive bias of moisture flux convergence, which implies that there is more moisture inflow into TP in LPA than that in SPA and HPA. Many of global climate models in CMIP5, whose horizontal resolution is 200km or coarser, has potential not to simulate water budget over TP properly, which may impact on a reproducibility of seasonal cycle of streamflow.",

The earliest phase of rifting started in the Early Paleocene when a Mesozoic convergent margin changed to extension. After about 30 Myrs of rifting, breakup in the major eastern subbasin of the SCS occurred in the Early Oligocene and subsequent breakup of the southwest subbasin took place in the Late Oligocene.\nSeismic reflection data imaging conjugate crustal sections result in a conceptual model for rift-evolution at conjugate margins in time and space.\nDistinct are regular undulations in the crust-mantle boundary. Individual rift basins are bounded to crustal blocks by listric normal faults on either side. Moho uplifts are distinct beneath major rift basins, while the Moho is downbended beneath crustal blocks. Most of the basin-bounding faults sole out within the middle crust. At the distal margins, detachment faults are located at a mid-crustal level where a weak zone decouples crust and mantle lithosphere during rifting. The lower crust in contrast is interpreted as being strong. Only in the region within about 50 km from the oceanic domain we suggest that normal faults reach the mantle, enabling potentially a coupling between the crust and the mantle. Here, at the proximal margins detachment fault dip either seaward or landward.\nLargely symmetric structures result from the initial rifting stage. At the future breakup position either of the rift basin bounding faults subsequently penetrates the entire crust, resulting in asymmetry at this location. However, asymmetric deformation which is controlled by large scale detachment faulting is confined to narrow areas and does not result in a margin-wide simple-shear model. Rather considerable along-margin variations are suggested resulting in alternating “upper and lower plate” margins.",

            "abstract": "We investigate numerically the passage of spontaneous, dynamic in-plane shear ruptures from initiation to their final rupture speed, using very fine grids, by carrying out more than 120 simulations. We identify two different mechanisms controlling supershear transition. For weaker faults, the rupture speed always passes continuously through the range of speeds between the Rayleigh and shear wave speeds (forbidden zone of rupture speeds for steady-state ruptures). This, however, occurs in a very short time, before the ruptures reach the compressional wave speed. The very short time spent in this range of speeds may explain why a jump over these speeds was seen in some earlier numerical and experimental studies, and confirms that this speed range is an unstable range, as predicted analytically for steady-state singular cracks and numerically for steady-state non-singular cracks. On the other hand, for stronger faults, we find that a daughter rupture is initiated by the main (mother) rupture, ahead of it. The mother rupture continues to propagate at sub-Rayleigh speed and eventually merges with the daughter rupture, but its speed jumps over the Rayleigh to shear wave speed range. We find that this daughter rupture is essentially a \"pseudo-rupture\", in that the two sides of the fault are already separated, but the rupture has negligible slip and slip velocity. After the mother rupture merges with it, the slip, the slip velocity and the rupture speed become dominated by those of the mother rupture. The results are independent of grid sizes and of methods used to nucleate the initial rupture.",

Wide use of observation techniques of broadband and high sampling rate in recent years offers condition to obtaining of deformation observation evidence for study of sub-instability.

The aim is to obtain fields:\n1. with prescribed spatial variability\n2. with observed values of the variable of interest at the observation locations (maybe at different spatial scales)\n3. with observations coupled through the model.\nFor this purpose a new conditional MC simulation method was developed. This method uses a high dimensional geometric concept to generate conditional random fields as a weighted sum of unconditional fields. A key feature of this technique is that a connected domain of fields fulfilling the first and the second condition can be generated. This domain has a simple continuous parametrization and can easily be enlarged.\nThe idea of the inverse modelling approach is to generate fields that fulfill the first and the second conditions so that these fields form a connected domain which has a continuous parametrization. Then the third condition can be handled by optimization inside the above described connected domain. If no sufficient solution can be obtained the dimensionality of the problem is increased by enlarging the continuous domain and the optimization is continued.\nTo illustrate the performance a comparison to a published benchmark study is carried out.",

            "abstract": "Instrumental and observational records are too short to adequately describe the history of land-falling storms or sea-level rise, especially for extreme and rare events such as Hurricane Sandy. However, the sediment preserved beneath coastal wetlands is an archive of when storms impacted the coast and past changes in sea level, and how long it takes for wetlands recovery from such events.\nHere, we describe late Holocene sediments beneath the Sea Breeze salt marsh on the New Jersey side of Delaware Bay from more than 200 gouge cores positioned along seven transects. The stratigraphic record documents at least seven depositional sequences consisting of salt-marsh peat and mud couplets that represent dramatic changes in sedimentation regime. There are number of processes that could cause this salt-marsh erosion including lateral migration of tidal creeks, rapid relative sea‑level rise, tsunamis, formation and expansion of salt pans, and storms. The abrupt contacts between the salt-marsh peat and overlying intertidal mud suggest that erosion of the peat was followed by rapid infilling of accommodation space. Correlation of erosional surfaces across 2.5 km suggests a common mechanism and we propose that the erosion was caused by hurricanes and/or large winter storms. Further, the changes in salt-marsh sedimentation documented at several sites on the north shore of Delaware Bay were synchronous and broadly correlate with storm over-wash deposits and historical record of hurricane landfalls in New Jersey.\nWe estimated wetland recovery time from hurricane-induced erosion using radiocarbon dates that bracket the erosive event in the sedimentary record. Following erosion and lowering of the marsh surface into the tidal frame a low-marsh ecosystem recolonizes the site, followed by recovery to a high salt-marsh environment. We estimate that this ecological and sedimentary succession can take up to 200 years.",

            "abstract": "Planktonic foraminifera are widely used for paleoceanographic reconstructions of different water mass dynamics. For accurate reconstruction, it is crucial to understand the habitat, ecology and shell chemistry of single species. In this study, living planktonic foraminifera were collected with a multi closing net in the Caribbean Sea during R/V Meteor cruises M78/1 in 2009, and M94, M95 in 2013 respectively. The population structure in surface to subsurface waters was assessed and related to salinity, temperature and chlorophyll concentrations. Stable isotopes and trace elements of shell calcite are measured to improve the proxy calibration. At all stations, the highest standing stock was observed in the near-surface layer and the highest population densities in the eastern Caribbean Sea. Markedly low abundances of foraminifera were recognized in Gulf of Paria and close to the Orinoco River plume. The most frequent species in the Caribbean were Globigerinoides sacculifer, Globigerinita glutinata, Globigerinoides ruber, Globigerinella calida, and Neogloboquadrina dutertrei. Abundance maxima of G. sacculifer and G. ruber were always recorded in the surface water. The preferred habitat of N. dutertrei was the near-surface mixed layer, even though the species has been commonly referred to calcify in the thermocline. As expected, the deep dweller Globorotalia truncatulinoides (dextral) was mainly observed in upper intermediate waters, although juvenile specimens were found at shallower depths. Plankton tow data showed that shallow-living species adjusted their habitat to surface water masses, which deepened in the southern Caribbean Sea from East to West. Furthermore, intermediate to deep dwellers appear to prevail in surface or subsurface waters during the early stage of their life cycle.",

Despite its frequent use as a term there is no real ‘one size fits all’ approach to EWS and the system may comprise of different elements depending on the time scale of the hazard, the quality of the information available to make decisions, as well as the population needs and habits. In most developing countries, the primary hydro-meteorological hazards are droughts and floods. These two hazards demand very different approaches: droughts occur over long time scales and are generally a consequence of a gradual process of reduced rainfall across a rainy season; Floods may be caused on seasonal timescales as well due to an overactive rainy season, but the most extreme consequences and loss of life are often suffered at short timescales and relate to flash flooding caused by severe thunderstorms, monsoon extremes and tropical cyclones.\nThis presentation will address the issues around implementing successful EWS and how these can be targeted to different time scales of hazards. Case studies illustrating the benefits of early information use and action will be shown along with open questions for debate on how the science community might better engage and help develop solutions to hazard warning.",

            "abstract": "Infrasound is sub-audible sound whose frequency range is about 3 mHz to 20 Hz. Because this frequency is common between atmospheric, oceanic and solid earth vibrations, those waves are interacting with each other and interaction itself generates infrasound. At polar region, cryosphere also play an important role for generation and propagation of infrasound.\nThe Japanese Antarctic infrasound observation started at April 2008. A sensor was installed at Syowa Station (SYO) in Lützow-Holm Bay (LHB) of East Antarctica, as a part of the International Polar Year. Characteristic infrasound waves observed at SYO demonstrate physical interaction involving environmental changes in the Antarctic region. Continuous recordings of infrasound clearly indicate existence of the hums generated by ocean-atmosphere interaction (microbaroms) with peaks of 0.1 to 0.25 Hz. Because larger amount of sea-ice extending around the LHB near SYO suppress ocean wave, the microbaroms become weak during austral winter. Following success of pilot observation, in austral summer in 2013, we extended one-sensor observation at SYO to 3-sensor arrayed observations, and installed a few field stations along the coast of the LHB. Newly established SYO array clearly detected the propagating directions and frequency contents of the microbaroms from Southern Ocean. In addition, we found harmonic signals around lowermost human audible band, however, currently unclear how and what generating hamonic signals. Those signals are recorded under windy condition. Since our system has no mechanical resonance at those frequency ranges, we speculate that the characteristic harmonic signals are probably related to local surficial phenomena such as ice sheet vibration generated by katabatic winds.\nInfrasound measurement at Antarctica could be a new proxy for monitoring a regional environmental change in high southern latitude. In such point of view, we will continue and improve the observations at and around SYO, Antarctica.",

            "abstract": "Repeating earthquake (REQ) sequence, which is a series of earthquakes with nearly identical waveforms and locations, is thought to represent repeated ruptures of small asperities on a fault plane. For understanding the generation process of recurrent interplate earthquakes, it is important to reveal how the rupture pattern changes in small REQs.\nRupture pattern changes of REQ will make difference especially in high-frequency components of the waveforms. In this study, we performed 1 kHz sampling-rate seismograph observation at permanent borehole stations (300-500m in depth) along the Sanriku coast, Japan for the period from April to November 2011, immediately after the Tohoku-Oki M9 earthquake, to investigate rupture pattern changes of M3.1-3.5 REQs in the northeastern Japan subduction zone.\nFirst, we make a pair of events belonging to the same REQ sequence and calculate their coherences. Although all the pairs show high coherences in lower-frequency band than their corner frequencies (6-10Hz), there are both high- and low-coherence pairs in the high frequency band. We find that pairs composed of an event (perturbed event) occurring immediately after nearby larger events and another (non-perturbed event) without such preceding events show lower coherences in high-frequency band, suggesting a stress perturbation by nearby earthquakes causes the high-frequency waveform differences.\nSecond, we investigate inter-event differences in group delay times of high-frequency components (30-45Hz) of the waveforms relative to low-frequency components (2-8Hz). We find that the inter-event differences are larger for the pairs of perturbed and non-perturbed events. This result indicates timings of high-frequency wave radiation with respect to centroid are different for the perturbed events.\nOur results suggest rupture patterns of REQs including high-frequency wave radiation do not change at random but are controlled by the stress condition near the asperity of the REQs.",

            "abstract": "Modelling studies suggest that density changes in Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) played a significant role in the reorganisation of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation over the last glacial period. From its principal site of formation in the SE Pacific, a significant proportion of AAIW is entrained in the Antarctic circumpolar current and enters the Atlantic through Drake Passage. Air-sea interaction within the subAntarctic SW Atlantic modifies this AAIW further, producing a cooler and fresher Atlantic end member of AAIW. Our core site is located where this branch of AAIW subducts and travels northwards along the western margin of the Atlantic basin.\nWe present the first high-resolution, multi-proxy study of AAIW in the sub-Antarctic SW Atlantic over the last 140 kyrs. Here, we focus on the temperature and salinity records over the last two glacial terminations and at the onset of the last glaciation. We use a combination of benthic stable isotopes and elemental ratios (Mg/Ca) on the shallow infaunal species Uvigerina peregrina to reconstruct AAIW temperature and salinity.\nOur records suggest that AAIW temperature both increased and decreased in a step-wise manner over the last 120 kyrs hinting at 3 ‘stable’ states for AAIW through the last glacial cycle (see shaded areas within figure). Another common feature is a transient interval of apparently warm, saline AAIW observed at the onset of both glacial terminations – could this be evidence of the ‘deep, salty blob’ or of increased outflow of Pacific surface waters?\nWe identify some fundamental differences between termination I and termination II; AAIW appears to have been markedly warmer during MIS6 than at the LGM. Furthermore, the glacial-interglacial potential density difference is much greater over termination I than termination II.",

            "abstract": "The rheology of the Earth’s upper mantle is controlled by the plasticity of olivine-rich rocks. Despite considerable efforts to better understand their plasticity, experimental flow laws fail to explain important geodetic and geophysical observations, such as fast post-seismic surface displacements or the “elusiveness” of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary beneath cratons. The plasticity of olivine single crystals is well understood and was experimentally quantified to mantle pressures and temperatures (e.g., Bai et al., 1991, JGR, 96, 2441-2463; Raterron et al., 2012, PEPI, 200-201, 105-112). The plasticity of aggregates, however, involves additional mechanisms, and the fundamental question of the amount of strain accommodation at grain boundaries remain unanswered.\nIn this study, we compare the plasticity of olivine aggregates deformed experimentally at mantle conditions (Durham et al., 2009, PEPI, 172, 67-73; Hilairet et al., 2012, JGR, 117, B01203 ; Bollinger et al., 2013, PEPI, 228, 211-219) to that of single crystals and demonstrate that strain at grain boundaries can be orders of magnitude larger than intracrystalline strain. We further show that the proportion of grain-boundary strain decreases with increasing temperature and stress. Applied along mantle geotherms, our results shows that grain boundary plasticity is dominant in the shallow mantle. The strength of olivine in the lithosphere can be more than one order of magnitude lower than predicted by classical flow laws (Hirth and Kohlstedt, 2003, AGU Geophys. Monogr, 138, 83–105). In the deep upper mantle, grain boundary plasticity vanishes and strain is mostly accommodated within the grains.",

Geological formations are complex and variable, punctual and scarce information are not adequate to understand, asses and manage them. Continuous data acquisition, their interpretation and integration with available geological/geophysical information is the solution. Heliborne dual moment transient electromagnetic (HeliTEM) and magnetic (HeliMAG) measurements have been carried out in divergent geological terrenes in India comprising Gangetic alluvium, Tertiary sediments underlying the Thar desert, Deccan basalts and Gondwana sediments, weathered and fractured granite gneisses and schists and the coastal alluvium with Tertiary sediments. The survey was carried out using state of the art equipment SkyTEM. The paper presents a synopsis of the results of the HeliTEM surveys that have helped in obtaining continuous information on the geoelectrical nature of sub-surface. HeliTEM data were supported by a number of ground geophysical surveys. The results provide the 3D subsurface structures controlling the groundwater conditions, the regional continuity of probable aquifers, the variations in lithological character and the quality of water in terms of salinity. Specialized features pertaining to hydrogeological characteristics obtained from this study are as follows:  A clear delineation of clay beds and their spatial distribution providing the multi-layered aquifer setup in the Gangetic plains.  Delineation of low resistivity zones in the quartzite below the over exploited aquifers indicating the possibility of new aquifers.  Presence of freshwater zones underneath the saline water aquifers in the thick and dry sands in deserts.  Clear demarcation of different lava flows, mapping the structural controls and highly porous zones in the contact of basalts and Gondwanas.  A complete and continuous mapping of weathered zone in crystalline hard rock areas providing information on the recharge zones.  The setting of multi-layered aquifer and different zones of salt water intrusion in the coastal sedimentary formations. The study has helped in establishing an appropriate cost-effective strategy for 3D mapping of aquifers on a regional scale providing valuable inputs to perform aquifer modeling",

            "abstract": "The largest fragment of Chelyabinsk meteorite fell into the Russian lake Chebarkul on February 15, 2013. We used magnetic scanner constructed by Youngwood Science and Engineering (YSE, see Kletetschka et al 2013) to obtain micromagnetic maps of one of the Chelyabinsk’s meteorite fragment. Our instrument has a Hall effect magnetic sensor and maps vertical component of the magnetic field approximately 0.3 mm above the planar surface of meteorite sample. Advantage of this instrument is a constant background field due to static position of the sensor. We applied fast Fourier transform inversion technique developed by Lima et al (2013). This technique is tailored for scanning magnetic microscopy (SMM), but may be also modified for aeromagnetic or satellite survey. It retrieves planar unidirectional magnetization distribution from micromagnetic field map. With this technique we achieved verifiable information about the source of the magnetic anomalies in our meteorite sample. Specific areas of detected magnetization were used for compositional analyses by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This way we obtain the ground truth for the source of magnetic anomalies of our meteorite thin section. Measurement of chemical composition of magnetic grains can be directly linked to the amount of magnetization for the specific magnetic mineralogy. The inversion technique was extended for interpretation of real magnetic anomalies on Mars.\n\nLima, E. A., B. P. Weiss, L. Baratchart,D. P.Hardin, and E. B.

            "abstract": "Observations from satellite can provide large region, fast and dynamic monitoring of aerosol properties. Polar Satellites provide once a day of observations at most, which is difficult to monitor aerosol temporal variabilities clearly. Only geostationary orbit satellites have the ability to provide both high temporal and spatial resolution observations.\nThe Korea Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) onboard COMs-1 (Communication、Ocean & Meteorological Satellite-1) mainly designed for ocean observation, but it has a good potential for land monitoring. Cross calibration between GOCI and the US Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) can improve the land radiation characteristics of GOCI, which can expand its ability in land observation.Cross calibration results show that the simulated TOA (Top Of Atmosphere) radiance from MODIS and GOCI measured TOA radiance agrees well.\nThe geostationary orbit satellite observing characteristics of the nearly constant view geometry and the high temporal resolution were used in aerosol retrieval algorithm. For images of two adjacent time points, the difference of TOA radiance mostly comes from the change caused by aerosol. AOD retrievals were accomplished using a Look-Up Table (LUT) strategy with assumptions of quickly varied aerosol and slowly varied surface with time. The AOD retrieval algorithm calculates AOD by minimizing the surface reflectance variations of series observations in a short period of time, e.g. several days. GOCI data from January 1, 2014 to April 1, 2014 were used to retrieve AOD, when the haze was very heavy. The monitoring of hourly AOD variations were implemented during this period and the retrieved AOD agrees well with AREONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) ground-based measurements. The result was also compared with MODIS AOD products.\nIn conclusion, GOCI was calibrated using MODIS data firstly in order to improve the radiation characteristics of land; then, the AOD retrieval algorithm was developed based on time series GOCI data; third, the AOD retrieval algorithm was developed to retrieve AOD synchronously.In this paper, the GOCI data are used to retrieve AOD with higher temporal resolution, which is important to atmospheric environmental monitoring.",

            "abstract": "In high pressures and high temperatures, the equations of state of reference materials, such as gold, platinum, and sodium chloride, have usually been used for the precise determination of the sample pressure. However, it is difficult to use this technique in laboratory-based experiments, because the synchrotron radiation source is often required. Although the fluorescence of ruby has been commonly used as the pressure sensor in previous laboratory-based experiments, it is impracticable at high temperatures. It is known that the first-order Raman mode of diamond anvil has been considered as a strong candidate because its Raman signal is intense and the diamond is always used as the anvil material. It is the purpose of this study to present the dependences of pressure and temperature on the Raman shift at the culet face of the diamond anvil.Gold powder, which was mixed with NaCl powder, was used as the pressure reference. The high-pressure and high-temperature experiments were performed using a hydrothermal diamond anvil cell (HTDAC). The sample was probed using angle-dispersive X-ray diffraction and Raman spectrometer system, located at the synchrotron beam line, at the BL10XU of SPring-8. The pressure was determined from the unit cell volume of gold using the equation of state for gold. The pressure and temperature dependences of the Raman shift were investigated [1]. The difference between our and previous studies increased rapidly with increasing pressure at pressures above 50 GPa, which is a fatal uncertainty for the pressure calibration. One possible explanation for this inconsistency is an influence of the stress condition in the sample chamber, because a significant deviatoric stress is accumulated during compression. The stress condition of the DAC experiment on the generated pressure is complicated because of some factors (e.g., the crystallographic orientation, design of the anvil, size of the culet, pressure transmitting medium, gasket material, and temperature). In our study, the cell was heated at each pressure increment. The heating is known to induce a significant release of the deviatoric stress during compression. This indicates our experimental methodology has an advantage to reduce the influence of deviatoric stress on the Raman shift of diamond.\n[1] Ono et al., J. Appl. Phys., (in press).",

            "abstract": "Predicting DNAPL fate and transport in heterogeneous aquifers is challenging and subject to an uncertainty that needs to be quantified. Models for this task needs to be equipped with an accurate source zone description, i.e., the distribution of mass of all partitioning phases (DNAPL, water, and soil) in all possible states ((im)mobile, dissolved, and sorbed), mass-transfer algorithms, and the simulation of transport processes in the groundwater. Such detailed models tend to be computationally cumbersome when used for uncertainty quantification. Therefore, a selective choice of the relevant model states, processes, and scales are both sensitive and indispensable. We investigate the questions: what is a meaningful level of model complexity and how to obtain an efficient model framework that is still physically and statistically consistent. In our proposed model, aquifer parameters and the contaminant source architecture are conceptualized jointly as random space functions. The governing processes are simulated in a three-dimensional, highly-resolved, stochastic, and coupled model that can predict probability density functions of mass discharge and source depletion times. We apply a stochastic percolation approach as an emulator to simulate the contaminant source formation, a random walk particle tracking method to simulate DNAPL dissolution and solute transport within the aqueous phase, and a quasi-steady-state approach to solve for DNAPL depletion times. Using this novel model framework, we test whether and to which degree the desired model predictions are sensitive to simplifications often found in the literature. With this we identify that aquifer heterogeneity, groundwater flow irregularity, uncertain and physically-based contaminant source zones, and their mutual interlinkages are indispensable components of a sound model framework.",

            "abstract": "Because metamorphism comprises a complex sequence of structural changes and chemical reactions that can be extended over several millions of years, metamorphic rocks cannot in general be said to have \"an age\". As a consequence, interpreting radiometric age data from metamorphic rocks requires first to establish the behavior of the isotopic system used for dating relative to the P-T conditions that a metamorphic rock experienced. As the U-Th-Pb system in monazite and allanite is not easily reset during subsequent temperature increase, allanite and monazite ages are interpreted as reflecting crystallization ages. Consequently, to interpret allanite and monazite crystallization ages, it is crucial to determine the physical conditions of their crystallization.\nA detailed account of the textural and chemical evolution of allanite and monazite along a well constrained prograde metamorphic suite of detrital sediments of the Greater Himalaya of Zanskar reveals that: (1) allanite is the stable REE accessory phase in the biotite and garnet zone and (2) at the staurolite-in isograd, allanite disappears abruptly from the metamorphic assemblage, simultaneously with the occurrence of the first metamorphic monazite. The finding of both monazite and allanite as inclusion in staurolite indicates that the breakdown of allanite and the formation of monazite occurred during staurolite crystallization. The preservation of allanite and monazite inclusions in garnet core and rim respectively allows to accurately identify the P-T conditions of the formation of the first metamorphic monazite. Thermobarometry indicates that, in both cases, monazite crystallization occurred at 600 °C. The fact that the substitution of allanite by monazite occurs spatially close, i.e. at similar P-T conditions, in all types of rocks whether they are Al-rich metapelites or more psammitic metasediments indicates that major silicate phases like staurolite or garnet do not play a significant role in the monazite forming reaction. Our data shows that the occurrence of the first metamorphic monazites in the rocks is mainly dependent on the pressure-temperature conditions and not on the bulk chemistry of the rocks. Dating monazite in metapelites means thus constraining the timing when these rocks reached the 600 °C isotherm.",

            "abstract": "The end of the last interglacial period, ~118 kyr ago, was characterized by substantial ocean circulation and climate perturbations resulting from instabilities of polar ice sheets, which are partially comparable to those projected for future climate change. The seasonal temperature changes of the tropical ocean, however, which play an important role in seasonal climate extremes such as hurricanes, floods and droughts at the present day, are not well known for this period that lead into the last glacial. Here we present a monthly resolved snapshot of reconstructed sea surface temperature variability in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean for 117.7 ± 0.8 kyr ago, using fossil coral (Diploria strigosa) Sr/Ca and δ18O records from Bonaire (Caribbean Netherlands). Our 20-year snapshot of reconstructed sea surface temperature variability for the end of the last interglacial is compared with Bonaire monthly coral Sr/Ca and δ18O records for snapshots since the mid-Holocene, comprising a total length of 295 years. We find that temperature seasonality in the southern Caribbean Sea at the end of the last interglacial was relatively stable and similar to today. Our coral records and simulations with a coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (COSMOS) indicate an orbital control on temperature seasonality in the tropical North Atlantic at the end of the last interglacial, despite the large-scale perturbations of ocean circulation and climate during this period, and suggest that temperature seasonality of the tropical surface ocean was a relatively stable feature of the ocean-atmosphere system at the end of the last interglacial.",

            "abstract": "The consequences of the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K/Pg) boundary event on the Earth system have been the subject of much scrutiny. Postulated climate events include a brief (10 – 2000 yr) period of global cooling induced by sulphate aerosols (the so-called ‘impact winter’), an interval of warming caused by impact-induced CO2release, as well as longer-term climatic oscillations during the subsequent 1 to 3Myr. Associated with these were putative changes in the biogeochemical cycle, manifested as carbon isotope excursions on both short- and long-term timescales.\nIn this study we develop new biomarker-based climate and biogeochemical records for the mid-Waipara River and Branch Stream sections, NZ. At Branch Stream, a pronounced negative (ca 6 to 8 permil) carbon isotope excursion occurs at the K/Pg; the excursion is recorded by higher plant biomarkers, consistent with some terrestrial records and suggesting that the immediate aftermath of the K/Pg boundary event was characterised by the massive release of 13C-depleted reduced carbon into the ocean-atmosphere reservoir.\nMixing across the K/Pg boundary at the Waipara section precludes a similar high-resolution investigation. Lower-resolution, longer-term records, however, also reveal a negative carbon istope excursion documented by both algal and higher plant biomarkers. This event appears to be distinct from that recorded at Branch Stream, being of lower magnitude and longer duration. It coincided with a transient terrestrial and marine warming and appears to have lasted at least 100 kyr and perhaps longer. We argue that this protracted negative CIE reflects a secondary and longer-term consequence of the K/Pg on the global carbon cycle. There is little evidence for an algal extinction as a range of C27 to C30 sterols continued to be deposited throughout the entire section, but changes in GDGT distributions do suggest a change in carbon export dynamics which could have impacted burial of 13C-depleted marine organic matter. Alternative explanations for the negative CIE include longer-term oxidation of more recalcitrant reduced carbon pools, i.e. soil organic matter, but that is not documented in the NZ sections.",

Seafloor and water column acoustic investigation with the use of ship-borne multibeam echosounder in 2013 (Gazcogne1 marine expedition) confirmed the presence of numerous (> 3000) persistent and widespread gas emission sites at water depths ranging from ~140 to 180 m. These fluid emissions are associated at the seafloor with high backscatter subcircular small-scale mounds, on average less than 2 m high and a few meters in diameter. Near-bottom visual observations and samplings were conducted with the ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) Victor (Gazcogne2 expedition). The whole mounds cover an area of ~200 km2 of the seabed, and are by-products of gas seepage, i.e. methane-derived authigenic carbonates. The spatial distribution of the seeps and related structures, based on water column acoustic gas flares and high backscatter seabed patches, appears to be relatively broad, with a North-South extension of ~80 km across the Parentis Basin and the Landes High, and a West-East extension along a few kilometers wide on the shelf, up to 8 km. Gas bubbles sampled at in situ conditions are principally composed of biogenic methane, possibly originated from Late Pleistocene deposits. The volume of methane emitted into the water column is abundant i) with an average gas flux varying locally from 0.035 to 0.37 Ln/min and ii) with regard to the time needed for the precipitation of the authigenic carbonates identified both at the seabed and in the upper most sedimentary column.\nThe GAZCOGNE study is co-funded by TOTAL and IFREMER as part of the PAMELA (Passive Margin Exploration Laboratories) scientific project.\n",

Studies have shown that the biases of simulated clouds display significant spatial pattern, which may introduce an important spatial pattern of the biases of simulated Rs and Ld. Therefore the evaluation results of global climate model Rs and Ld simulations may depend on the location of the ground observations. In this study, comprehensive ground-based observations were used to evaluate the Rs and Ld simulations from Earth System Models (ESMs) in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). We found that the overestimation of Rs and the underestimation of Ld still exist in CMIP5. We also quantified the representation of ground-based observations and their uncertainties in the global estimations of Rs and Ld. After removing the biases of CMIP5 ESMs, the globally averaged Rs is estimated to be 187 W m-2 from 2000 to 2005, and the globally averaged Ld from 1992 to 2005 is estimated to be 341 W m-2.",

For instance, H2O/CO2 ratio in the fluid phase influences the location of the solidus and of carbonation/decarbonation reactions in peridotitic systems . In the scientific literature, the speciation of COH fluids has been generally assumed on the basis of thermodynamic calculations using equations of state of simple H2O-non-polar gas systems (e.g., H2O-CO2-CH4). Only few authors dealt with the experimental determination of high-pressure COH fluid species at different conditions, using diverse experimental and analytical approaches (e.g., piston cylinder+capsule-piercing+gas-chromatography/mass-spectrometry; cold-seal+silica glass capsules+Raman).\nWe performed experiments on COH fluids using a capsule-piercing device coupled with a quadrupole mass spectrometry. This type of analyzer ensures superior performances in terms of selectivity of molecules to be detected, high acquisition rates and extended linear response range.\nExperiments were carried out in a rocking piston cylinder apparatus at pressure of 1 GPa and temperatures from 800 to 900°C. Carbon-saturated fluids were generated through the addition of oxalic acid dihydrate and graphite. Single/double capsules and different packing materials (BN and MgO) were used to evaluate the divergence from the thermodynamic speciation model. Moreover, to assess the effect of solutes on COH fluid speciation we also performed a set of experiments adding synthetic forsterite to the charge.\nTo determine the speciation we assembled a capsule-piercing device that allows to puncture the capsule in a gas-tight vessel at 80°C. The extraction Teflon vessel is composed of a base part, where the capsule is allocated on a steel support, and a top part where a steel drill is mounted. To release the quenched fluids from the capsule, the base part of vessel is hand-tighten to the top part, allowing the steel pointer to pierce the capsule. The evolved gases are then convoyed to a quadrupole mass spectrometer through a heated line to avoid the condensation of water.\nOur results suggest that fluid speciation can diverge considerably compared to the thermodynamic model depending on the experimental strategies adopted and on the presence of solutes in complex COH systems.",

            "abstract": "Trees located on slopes underneath rock cliffs are excellent recorders of spatio-temporal rockfall activity and can provide long-term, yet annually resolved information on possible changes in rockfall frequency and/or magnitude. Rockfall in mountains depends, among others, on freeze-thaw cycles and/or the melting of winter ice in clefts. Its temporal frequency and magnitude is likely to be altered at higher elevations as a result of ongoing climatic changes, even more so in environments controlled by permafrost. Here we focus on >100 years of rockfalls released from periglacial environments in the Swiss Alps. Based on the 400 time series of century-old larch (Larix decidua Mill.) trees, we demonstrate that rockfall activity has increased significantly between the end of the Little Ice Age and today, and that enhanced rockfall activity is clearly correlated with above-average summer temperatures (and therefore melting permafrost). Rockfall is most abundant when after several years with above-average summer temperatures and its activity exhibits a certain lag in the response, presumably as a result of inertia in permafrost bodies. With ongoing climate change, rockfall activity is expected to increase, and thereby creating critical situations in several parts of the Alps where rockfalls without historical precedents will likely affect transportation corridors and/or inhabited areas. Research on the evolution of rockfall processes from periglacial environments can help to reduce the risk emanating from new processes or process magnitudes, and - in combination with scenario-based process modeling - facilitate the planning of adequate countermeasures.",

Distinct patterns in the organization of soil moisture, vegetation type, and landscape morphology have been documented in close relation to aspect in a range of climates. Within catchments, from north to south facing slopes, studies have shown ecotone shifts from forest to shrub species, and steep diffusion-dominated landforms to fluvial landforms. Over the long term differential evolution of ecohydrology and geomorphology leads to observed asymmetric structure in the planform of channel network and valley morphology. In this talk we present examples of coupled modeling of ecohydrology and geomorphology driven by solar radiation. In a cellular automata model of vegetation dynamics we will first show how plants organize in north and south facing slopes and how biodiversity changes with elevation. When vegetation-erosion feedbacks are coupled emergent properties of the coupled system are observed in the modeled elevation and vegetation fields. Integrating processes at a range of temporal and spatial scales, coupled models of ecohydrologic and geomorphic dynamics enable examination of global change impacts on landscapes and ecosystems.",

Drastic reductions in gauge networks are being experienced worldwide and many are plagued by error. On the other hand different methods such as radar or satellites provide indirect and partly erroneous information on precipitation. Due to the high variability it is essential to use all possible available sources for the reliable estimation of precipitation at ungauged locations. A general spatial statistical model is presented which can be used:\nto infill precipitation in the form of probability distributions for locations with incomplete records\nto interpolate precipitation from infilled and incomplete records\nto reflect the influence of topography and other deterministic features on precipitation\nto consider indirect measurements in the form of covariates and/or constraints.\nThe method is using Gaussian copula based constrained simulation, and offers a very flexible combination of the different sources of information. As simulation methodology it can be directly used for uncertainty assessment. Examples from South-West Germany and from South Africa are used to demonstrate the methodology.",

            "abstract": "Excess evaporation in the subtropics forms a local surface salinity maximum in all subtropical ocean basins. Descent of these waters to depth creates a core layer marked by a subsurface salinity maximum (S-max) spreading towards the equator, an integral part of the lower limb of the meridional subtropical overturning cell. Here we will investigate what governs the evolution of the S-max core layer in the North Atlantic. It is suggested that the export is not just determined by subduction along isopycnals. The S-max core layer is modified along its spreading path by a non uniform diapycnal mixing profile, leading to a migration of the S-max across density surfaces (induced core layer). We propose a combination of diabatic surface fluxes and double diffusion beneath the salty surface waters as crucial for the properties and spreading path of the S-max towards the equator. The regional differences in stratification and potential for double diffusive processes in the central waters of the world ocean basins pose an interesting aspect for future research. It might be an important mechanism responsible for differences in the behavior of the shallow overturning in each basin.

In semi-arid to arid Central Australia, many of the hydrological variations have generally been attributed to variations in monsoon strength and position. While an increasing number of studies has recently addressed the reconstruction of monsoonal variations from high-resolution proxy records in tropical Australasia, very little data is available on the landscape-scale impacts such as weathering, erosion, flooding and sediment transport. Therefore, unraveling the impacts of past changes in monsoonal intensity on fluvial systems in Australia's tropical north - the 'Top End' - will substantially contribute to our understanding of cause and effect of climate change. Our study presents first results from the Adelaide River, one of the major river systems draining the 'Top End'. Here, extensive but currently inactive floodplains have accreted along the middle reaches of the catchment upstream of bedrock constrictions. Virtually no data is so far available from these floodplains although their stratigraphic and sedimentary record should contain valuable information on the late Quaternary evolution of the fluvial system in northern Australia. We have cored a transect of nine sediment profiles across the floodplains and levees associated with the Adelaide River. Based on these profiles, we (i) document their geomorphologic setting based on the analysis of high-resolution (LIDAR) elevation models and remote sensing data, (ii) establish a first stratigraphy for these floodplains based on field description, grain sizes and detailed total element data, (iii) present a chronological framework for the sediments based on luminescence dating, and (iv) discuss the significance of these results in terms of the larger-scale evolution of paleoenvironments and sea-level in the seasonal tropics during the late Quaternary.",

            "abstract": "There is a lack of consensus with regard to the observed enhanced concentrations of methane at East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS), as well as on the long-running effect it may have on the global climate. One group of scientists suggest that it is attributed to venting from the deep layers, and may dramatically increase in the coming decades due to thawing and increased perforation of permafrost, ultimately leading to amplification of the global warming. The other group refutes this hypothesis and supports the standpoint that the observed enhanced fluxes, up to 6-8 ppm whereas the latitude-mean is 185 ppm, are not related to recent permafrost changes but are rather attributed to the geological structure of the shelf.\nWe analyzed data from land, marine and satellite observations and developed the conceptual model that consistently explains the atmospheric methane field in the Arctic in the context of the past, present, and future environmental changes. We explore the hypothesis, according to which enhanced concentrations of methane are associated with the geological history of ESAS. We hypothesized that observed enhanced methane venting is bound to unfrozen bottom sediments surrounding fault zones and paleo river beds, where permafrost never existed in the bottom sediments, while elsewhere on the inner shelf of ESAS sediments remain frozen and impermeable for gases since the last glacial maximum. We tested this hypothesis through analysis of the geological and paleo data, constructing the digital high resolution map of the fault zones and paleo river beds, comparing it with locations of the hydrographic stations where enhanced methane fluxes have been observed (Fig. 1), and performing spatial statistical analysis. We demonstrated that (1) the current rate of methane concentration rise over the ESAS does not exceed that in the rest of the Arctic and in the Northern hemisphere, and (2) the probability of methane concentrations being above the average decreases with the distance to the nearest fault zone or paleo river bed. These results do not support the hypothesis of the so-called “methane bomb” at ESAS.\nAcknowledgement. This study is supported by the Russian Science Foundation, project 14-17-00037.",

The discrepancy has been attributed to the presence of alumina, to that of ferric iron, to multiphase equilibria and even to the activity of FeO in the system. In order to mitigate the discrepancy, we synthesized a sample with San Carlos olivine composition that was doped in alumina. We then used this as starting material for experiments in the laser-heated diamond anvil cell at lower mantle (P,T) conditions along the geotherm. Samples were pressurized, heated, transformed to bridgemanite and ferropericlase, equilibrated, quenched, and decompressed. Thin sections were recovered from the hotspot using a focused ion beam microscope and the composition of the two phases was analyzed using analytical transmission electron microscopy.\nIron partitioning in Al-rich olivine will be discussed through a detailed comparison with the Al-rich pyrolitic trend and the Al-free olivine trend.\n",

            "abstract": "Ice streams can rapidly drain large sectors of ice sheet interiors. At present, they account for approximately 50% and 90% of the mass loss from Greenland and Antarctica, respectively, but there are concerns over recent increases in ice discharge. This has been linked to atmospheric and oceanic warming, but the longer-term implications for ice sheet deglaciation are less clear. A key question is whether the activity of ice streams is predictably linked to climate-driven ice sheet mass balance, or whether their activity might accelerate deglaciation. To explore this, we analyse ice streaming during deglaciation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) from ~18 to ~7 ka. Following a recent mapping inventory, we bracket the timing of >100 ice streams using published ice margin chronologies. At the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), ice streams formed a drainage network similar to modern ice sheets. Numerous ice streams were located in topographic troughs and likely operated for thousands of years from the LGM. These drained the marine-based sectors of the northern and eastern margins of the ice sheet until ~11 ka and show a degree of spatial self-organisation. Other ice streams operated on much shorter time-scales and turned on and off, perhaps in as little as a few hundred years. These include large ice streams that switched positions over sedimentary bedrock at the western and southern terrestrial margins until ~13 ka. As the LIS retreated onto its low-relief and predominantly crystalline bedrock interior (after ~11 ka), a smaller number of large ice streams operated that were very wide (50-100 km), and have no modern analogue. Overall, the number of ice streams decreased during deglaciation and they drained a smaller proportion of the ice sheet margin: 30% at the LGM (similar to present-day Antarctica), 15% at 12 ka, and 12% at 10 ka. We use simple scaling relationships to estimate the mass loss delivered by ice streams and examine their role during deglaciation.",

At this time scale, most insoluble trace gases (e.g., ozone, some VOCs) can be treated as nearly conserved tracers. While the atmospheric chemistry community is most interested in the chemical consequences of the trace gases being lofted, these composition measurements, if sampled properly inside and near convection, can be utilized to study convective dynamics including lateral entrainment and mixing in the outflow. We will use measurements made from a recent NASA field campaign, SEAC4RS to illustrate how such studies can be conducted. Also, we analyzed long-term data from MOZAIC project to corroborate the findings from SEAC4RS. It will be shown that using trace gases to diagnose convective dynamics sometimes has certain advantages over the traditional meteorological approach using, e.g., equivalent potential temperature.",

The Doppler lidar data has been utilized to address the daytime boundary layer evolution and related aerosol dynamics over the site. Mixing layer height is estimated by wavelet covariance transform method and found to be ~ 0.7 km, AGL. Aerosol optical depth observations during daytime revealed an asymmetry showing clear enhancement during afternoon hours as compared to forenoon. Interestingly, Fourier and wavelet analysis of vertical velocity and attenuated backscatter showed similar 50-90 min short period gravity wave signatures during afternoon hours. Moreover, our observations showed that gravity waves are dominant within the boundary layer implying that the daytime boundary layer dynamics is playing a vital role in transporting the aerosols from surface to the top of the boundary layer. Similar modulations are also evident in surface parameters like temperature, relative humidity and wind speed indicating these waves are associated with the dynamical aspects over Himalayan region. Finally, time evolution of range-height indicator snapshots during daytime showed strong upward velocities especially during afternoon hours implying that convective processes through short period gravity waves plays a significant role in transporting aerosols from the nearby valley region to boundary layer top over the site. These observations also establish the importance of wave induced daytime convective boundary layer dynamics in the lower Himalayan region.",

The consequences of these adverse hydrometeorological conditions may be mitigated through informed planning and response, given useful and skillful forecasts of these conditions. However, the potential value and applicability of these forecasts is unavoidably linked to their forecast quality.\nIn this work we evaluate the skill of four global circulation models (GCMs) part of the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) project in forecasting seasonal precipitation and temperature over the continental United States. The GCMs we consider are the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL)-CM2.1, NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (NASA-GMAO)-GEOS-5, The Center for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Studies – Rosenstiel School of Marine & Atmospheric Science (COLA-RSMAS)-CCSM3, Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis (CCCma) - CanCM4. These models are available at a resolution of 1-degree and monthly, with a minimum forecast lead time of nine months, up to one year. These model ensembles are compared against gridded monthly temperature and precipitation data created by the PRISM Climate Group, which represent the reference observation dataset in this work.\nAspects of forecast quality are quantified using a diagnostic skill score decomposition that allows the evaluation of the potential skill and conditional and unconditional biases associated with these forecasts. The evaluation of the decomposed GCM forecast skill over the continental United States, by season and by lead time allows for a better understanding of the utility of these models for flood and drought predictions. Moreover, it also represents a diagnostic tool that could provide model developers feedback about strengths and weaknesses of their models.",

            "abstract": "Soufriere Hills volcano (SHV), Montserrat has been in a state of ongoing unrest since 1995. Prior to eruptions, an increase in the number of seismic events has been observed. We use the Material Failure Law (MFL) (Voight, 1988) to investigate how an accelerating number of low frequency seismic events are related to the timing of a large scale dome collapse in June 1997. We show that although the forecasted timing of a dome collapse may coincide with the known timing, the accuracy of the application of the MFL to the data is poor. Using a cross correlation technique we show how characterising seismicity into similar waveform \"families'' allows us to focus on a single process at depth and improve the reliability of our forecast. A number of families are investigated to assess their relative importance. We show that despite the timing of a forecasted dome collapse ranging between several hours of the known timing of collapse, each of the families produces a better forecast in terms of fit to the seismic acceleration data than when using all low frequency seismicity. In addition, we investigate the stability of such families between major dome collapses (1997 and 2003), assessing their potential for use in real-time forecasting.\nInitial application of Grey's Incidence Analysis suggests that a key parameter influencing the potential for a large scale slumping on the dome of SHV is the rate of low frequency seismicity associated with magma movement and dome growth. We undertook numerical modelling of an andesitic dome with a hydrothermally altered layer down to 800m. The geometry of the dome is based on SHV prior to the collapse of 2003. We show that a critical instability is reached once slope angles exceed 25°, corresponding to a summit height of just over 1100m a.s.l.. The geometry of failure is in close agreement with the identified failure plane suggesting that the input mechanical properties are broadly consistent with reality. We are therefore able to compare different failure geometries based on edifice geomorphology and determine a Factor of Safety associated with such scenarios. This modelling would be extremely useful in a holistic forecasting approach within a volcanic environment.\n",

Because relative to the whole fault plane, the seismic power radiation area is sparse in a specific moment during a great earthquake. CS method is used to invert the rupture process from teleseismic P wave data recorded by multiple seismic arrays with different azimuths and epicentral distances. Synthetic tests illustrate that, our method can suppress the artifacts caused by interference phases ( eg. PcP ) thus we can obtain a more reliable result than using the data from a single array. Moreover, the “swimming effect” in traditional back-projection method can be reduced due to the better azimuth coverage. Then the rupture process of the Mw7.9 earthquake in the Aleutian Islands, occurred at June 23, 2014 20:53 UTC is inverted. The results show that the rupture is along the subduction zone, which can be used to locate the primary fault plane combined with central moment tensor. In addition, where the released power concentrates in the earthquake is also given, which could help us determine which area is effected by the earthquake most heavily, thus the rescue operation can be effective. In conclusion, different from traditional beamforming method, CS can offer a high-resolution solution.",

It was assumed that the constriction of the CAS reached a critical threshold during the early Pliocene (~4.8-4 Ma) and model simulations predicted a warming of the Northern Hemisphere and a cooling of the Southern Hemisphere, which climatic effects are known as “Panama hypothesis”. The constriction of the Indonesian seaway had profound climatic effects on the surrounding ocean areas during ~4-3 Ma, with possible effects for the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation. We here present combined measurements of Mg/Ca and δ18O from planktic foraminifera to reconstruct sea surface temperatures and changes in salinities in both hemispheres during the Pliocene epoch. Within ~4.8-3.9 Ma our reconstructions support the Panama hypothesis with a simultaneous sea surface cooling and freshening of ~2-3 °C of southern hemisphere sites, when North Atlantic Site 552A indicate a warming and more saline conditions. After ~3.9 Ma, our data is in contrast to an ongoing restriction of the CAS and rather suggest that the constriction of the Indonesian Seaway might have reduced the Atlantic thermohaline circulation, leading to significant cooling in the North Atlantic Ocean.",

The key variables determined from the tests include pH and redox adjustment of the treatment system, treatment efficiency for acidity and metals, sulfate removal rates, and precipitation of secondary minerals as sinks for metals. The results showed that all of the five columns removed metals of concern (i.e., Al, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Ni, Zn) with residence time of 15 hours and greater. The organic materials used in the test provided sufficient sulfate reduction that is available for metal removal in the mine drainage. The sulfate removal rates ranged between 200 and 600 mg/L/day.

            "abstract": "The land surface on the Tibetan Plateau experiences typical diurnal and seasonal freeze/thaw processes that play important roles in the regional water and energy exchanges, and recent passive microwave satellites provide opportunities to detect the soil state for the unique region. With the support of three soil moisture and temperature networks in the Tibetan Plateau, a dual-index microwave algorithm with AMSR-E (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System) data is developed for the detection of soil surface freeze/thaw state. One index is the standard deviation index (SDI) of brightness temperature (TB), which is defined as the standard deviation of horizontally polarized brightness temperatures at all AMSR-E frequencies. It is the major index and is used to reflect the reduction of liquid water content after soils get frozen. The other index is the 36.5 GHz vertically-polarized brightness temperature, which is linearly correlated with ground temperature and thus is utilized to detect it. The threshold values of the two indices (SDI and the brightness temperature at 36.5 GHz vertically-polarized) are determined based on a part of in situ data from the network located in a semi-arid climate, and the algorithm was validated against other in situ data from this network. Further validations were conducted based on the other two networks located in different climates (semi-humid and arid, respectively). Results show that this algorithm has accuracy of more than 90% for the semi-humid and semi-arid regions, and misclassifications mainly occur at the transition period between unfrozen and frozen seasons. Nevertheless, the microwave signals have limited capability in identifying the soil surface freeze/thaw state in the arid region, because they can penetrate deep dry soils and thus embody the bulk information beneath the surface.",

Recent observations from MESSENGER reveal that during events of enhanced solar wind dynamical pressure, the subsolar magnetopause may actually be pushed until the immediate vicinity of the planet surface. Using three-dimensional single-particle simulations, we examine the dynamics of solar wind originating protons during such events. We show that these impulsive events can lead to substantial (several hundreds of eVs or a few keVs) H+ energization in the plasma mantle. Unlike ions with large mass-to-charge ratios (e.g., Na+ of planetary origin), H+ are transported adiabatically during these events, their energization being due to the ExB convection surge. MESSENGER observations of the plasma mantle show repeated evidences of such a transient H+ energization which may follow from the variable character of Mercury's magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "For the Manihiki Plateau, a Large Igneous Province (LIP), a multistage volcanic emplacement history is revealed in new, multi channel high resolution seismic reflection data. Gathered during cruise So224 the profiles are distributed to study the initial emplacement of the High Plateau (HP), part of the Manihiki Plateau, as well as tectonic related processes at its margins. Extension of a previously defined seismostratigraphic model has allowed an identification of an intra-basalt reflector which has been formed by volcanism prior to the major emplacement during the early Cretaceous. We suggest that it represents the nucleus of the HP’s formation and conclude that the Manihiki Plateau is older than the proposed ~120 Ma. We have identified evidence that the plateau extended to the east and broke-up along the Manihiki Scarp prior to the second volcanic active phase. The south-western margin shows a stretched and rifted structure, which could be related to the separation of the Manihiki and Hikurangi Plateaus. Identification of extrusion centers associated with a third volcanic active period ending ~65 Ma ago and their spatial distribution hint on a shift of the emplacement mechanism from sources related to initial emplacement to tectonic induced volcanism at the margins. Later stage tectonic and volcanic reactivations occurred, which were concentrated in the south-western part of the HP.",

            "abstract": "The Comet Acoustic Surface Sounding Experiment (CASSE) is housed in the six soles of Philae’s landing feet, thus being the first part of the spacecraft that has mechanical contact with the comet. It consists of three piezoelectric, triaxial accelerometers and three transducers, each of which consists of a stack of 80 piezoelectric elements connected electrically in parallel. This combination allows for both passive listening to the comet and active sounding of the subsurface.\nAfter a calibration during descent, when the answer of the unfolded landing gear to active soundings will be determined, the touchdown is the first event that will be recorded for scientific purposes: The shock experienced by the accelerometers in the first milliseconds after touchdown is indicative for elastic/plastic deformation parameters of the cometary soil. The time series recorded by all three accelerometers will also support the reconstruction of the landing process itself, by indicating the touchdown sequence of the feet, and also a possible activity of the lander’s ice screws.\nDuring the First Science Sequence, expected to last 4 or 5 cometary days, a number of measurements will be conducted. In a sounding experiment, the piezoelectric transducers will send rectangular signals with frequencies up to 640 Hz between the feet. It is expected that both compressional and shear waves will be recorded. Additionally, CASSE will listen to the MUPUS hammering: this is a strong acoustic source of known location, as MUPUS measures its current depth of penetration. Signal travel times between feet and from MUPUS can be interpreted in terms of elastic constants, possibly as functions of depth and time, while the presence and decay of scattered waves depends on structural parameters like porosity and layering on wavelength scale.\nAfter the First Science Sequence, a Long-Term Science Sequence will allow the repetition of measurements in order to monitor possible changes of the comet during its passage towards the sun, and periods of passive listening to the acoustic emissions of the comet itself.\nIn this contribution, we will give an overview of the data recorded so far, first evaluations of the touchdown signals in comparison to previous calibration landing tests carried out on sand, and possibly first results of the sounding and listening measurements.",

            "abstract": "There is an on-going debate about the length of residence time in silicic magmatic systems. Here, we present an example of a silicic volcanism characterized by several Ma long crystallization history, which is comparable with that of large silicic batholiths. In the Carpathian-Pannonian region, an ignimbrite flare-up episode occurred during the Miocene. This volcanism was fed by large volume silicic magmas and was coeval with the formation of the Pannonian basin by major lithospheric stretching. Excellent outcrops of these volcanic products are found in the Bükkalja Volcanic Field, northern part of the region. We performed high-precision in-situ zircon U-Pb dating by LA-ICP-MS using selected samples collected from continuous stratigraphic sections, comprising pyroclastic flow and fall deposits of the entire volcanism. We conducted at least 50 spot analyses for each samples and applied strict selection procedure to use only concordant data. The youngest age population of the Isoplot Unmix ages (in case of >5 MSWD; most of the samples) or the weighted mean ages are considered to be the closest to the eruption ages. According to these age data, the volcanism lasted from 18.2 Ma to 14.0 Ma, and the volcanic deposits can be well correlated. Six eruption events are distinguished separated by a few 100’s ka up to 1.6 Ma repose times. In case of most samples, the large MSWD values and the wide range of 206Pb/238U isotope ratios of the individual spot analyses suggest prolonged (even more than 1.5-2 Ma) zircon crystallization. Based on the evaluation of the whole data set, 10 zircon crystallization peak-periods started at 19.6 Ma can be clearly distinguished. This is consistent with a model involving a long-lasting silicic crystal mush system with periodic rejuvenation of zircon crystallization and withdrawal of medium to large volume eruptible magmas. This requires elevated heat-flux and thermally prepared upper crust during the Middle Miocene continental rifting period.",

            "abstract": "This study documents the palaeodrainage history of the Nile River, in particular the time of its transition from a small locally sourced drainage network to the initiation of an extensive catchment. Today, the Nile drains as far south as Lake Victoria, with the White Nile draining largely cratonic rocks of Archean to Proterozoic age and the Blue Nile draining Cenozoic Ethiopian Continental Flood Basalts and Neoproterozoic basement. However, the timing of catchment expansion to the river's current extent is highly debated. Two end member models are: A) The Blue Nile did not connect with the lower Nile until the Late Messinian, and the White Nile not until 0.5 Ma. In this model, the pre-Messinian Nile delta sediments are locally derived from the Red Sea Hills (RSH) (Issawi and McCauley 1992). B) The Blue Nile has been connected to the lower Nile since the Oligocene (Burke and Wells 1989). Onshore fieldwork characterised each possible source area (Ethiopian flood basalts, Archean craton, and Neoproterozoic basement and Phanerozoic cover sequences of the RSH) using petrography, geochemistry and isotope studies. Tertiary-aged Nile delta sediments provide a unique archive of the river's palaeodrainage history, which were analysed from conventional core from exploration and appraisal wells in order to identify the occurrence (if any) of these sources in the delta geological record. Heavy mineral, petrographic, U/Pb rutile and Lu/Hf zircon analyses indicate Blue Nile and/or RSH input to the Nile delta since at least the Oligocene with very little input from the White Nile. Sr and Nd whole-rock analyses of mud samples allow discrimination between the Blue Nile and RSH sources and may, subject to further analyses, confirm Blue Nile input to the delta since the Oligocene. U-Pb zircon analyses reveal the presence of 20-30 Ma zircons in both the modern river sediments from the Ethiopian Highlands and the Nile Delta core from the early Miocene to present day indicating a connection between the lower Nile and the Blue Nile since at least the early Miocene.",

            "abstract": "Ten years of Cassini/RPWS remote and in situ observations of Saturn and its environment have provided a rich return feeding numerous studies of the various types of kronian radio emissions (such as Saturn’s kilometric radiation [SKR], auroral hiss, narrowband [NB] and drifting burst emissions, and Saturn’s electrostatic discharges [SED]), local plasma waves (such as chorus, upper hybrid bands and electron cyclotron harmonic emissions) and dusty plasmas. Nonetheless, several major objectives for RPWS science remain for the last three years of the Cassini mission, and will culminate with the detailed study of Saturn’s auroral regions, where SKR and possibly other types of radio waves are produced and large-scale plasma acceleration is suspected to take place. During the F-ring and proximal orbital sequences, Cassini is expected to pass through northern and southern auroral regions tens of times around noon local time. These passes can be accurately predicted through the modeling of SKR sources and in turn help to trigger combined observations with other Cassini instruments and Earth-based observatories such as Hubble. Altogether, these observations will provide crucial complementary insights to understand kronian auroral processes. RPWS will also continue to measure the rotational modulation of various radio emissions (SKR, NB and hiss), pushing forward the study of magnetospheric periodicities long after equinox, pursue the monitoring of SEDs and lightning whistlers, whose occurrence probes the activity of atmospheric storms, or probe in detail the dusty environment of the D ring and wave-particle interactions taking place in the very inner magnetosphere where the magnetic field links the planet to the rings.",

            "abstract": "Initial results from GOSAT flux inversions of column-integrated carbon dioxide suggest a significant redistribution of surface fluxes compared to inversions using only surface-based inversions as an observational constraint. New evidence suggests that this redistribution of fluxes is a robust feature, and is related to the increased spatial density of the measurements made available by remote sensing. However GOSAT's rather large measurement footprint and sparse sampling still provide poor coverage over many areas of the globe, particularly regions characterized by consistent cloud cover, such as the tropics, and all passive near-infrared sensors suffer from a seasonal sampling bias due to limited sunlight during high latitude winter. As such, errors in the pattern of retrieved fluxes may still be significant. Active sensors based on lidar do not suffer from the same seasonal (or diurnal) sampling biases, and their exceptionally small instantaneous field of view (~150 m) promises to greatly improve the spatial coverage of the measurements over partially cloudy regions. Using the case of MERLIN, a planned joint French-German lidar mission designed to measure XCH4, the implications of this increased spatial coverage is considered in an inverse modelling framework, and compared to presently available measurement coverage from the surface-based network and GOSAT. The gain in knowledge about the absolute size of the regional methane fluxes, particularly in currently undersampled regions such as the Arctic permafrost zones and tropical wetlands, is quantified.",

            "abstract": "Measurements conducted with the ASPERA plasma probe and the magnetometer of the Venus Express (VEX) spacecraft in orbits that probed by the midnight plane within the Venus wake show the presence of a sharp plasma transition outside the region where enhanced fluxes of planetary ions are observed. That transition agrees with a feature reported earlier [1] from the VEX electron measurements and that is now also characterized by a sharp change in the speed and density of the solar wind H+ ions [2]. From the analysis of the plasma data of 10 VEX orbits in two different time periods (August 2006 and September 2009) it is possible to derive the position of the VEX spacecraft at the time when the plasma transition is observed in all 10 orbits. The data show a collection of different distances downstream from Venus where the plasma transition is detected and that are grouped for each time period. As a whole the X-distance on the sun-Venus line downstream from the planet for each of the 5 orbits corresponding to the August 2006 time period is smaller than that corresponding to the 5 orbits of the September 2009 time period. The average distance difference between both sets of data points is nearly one half planetary radius thus leading to two different groups in their distribution. The position of the plasma transition downstream from Venus will vary along the solar cycle being displaced to regions that extend farther away from the inner wake under solar maximum conditions.\n[1] Pérez-de-Tejada, H.et al., JGR, 116, JA015216, 2011.\n[2] Pérez-de-Tejada, H.et al., JGR, 118, JA019029, 2013.",

            "abstract": "The 2008 Sichuan earthquake, occurred on 12 May 2008 with a magnitude of 8.0 and the center at Wenchuan (\n31.021°N, 103.367°E\n), has not only caused a large number of human casualties and property loss, but also severely damaged the ecological system in its surrounding 10 counties, threatening the local ecological safety. As part of the post-disaster reconstruction services, a systematic monitoring of the ecological restoration at the central quake-hit areas has been made based on RS & GIS remote sensing. In this paper we selected the Dujiangyan area for analysis. The reason to select this region is because that Dujiangyan area is about 40 km from the epicenter, and as a region in the subtropical monsoon climate zone, it has a well developed forest ecosystem in the northern part before the earth quake. The coverage of grassland in this region is relatively less. Since the ecological restoration after the earthquake is a long term process, the restoration for different vegetation types has different characteristics. From the analysis of the spatiotemporal change of land-use and vegetation cover in Dujiangyan area from the post-earthquake in 2008 to 2013, we found: (1) During the earthquake, the major vegetation type destroyed is the woodland, which accounts for 99.34% of the destroyed area, and the next are arable land and grassland. (2) The ecological restoration started from the grassland and gradually transited to shrub. In two years after the earthquake, the most significant increase in both area of coverage and magnitude is the grassland, and by 2013, the area of grassland decreased slightly, and instead the area of shrub increased, demonstrating a transition trend from the grassland to the shrub. (3) From the map of vegetation cover, we can see these change occurs mainly in the northern mountain area, while the change of land use mainly occurred in the southern part of the city. These changes can be linked clearly with the earthquake disaster and the post- reconstruction human activities.",

We describe a modeling framework and an automatic control algorithm that prescribe optimal releases from the Selingue dam in the Upper Niger River Basin, with the objective of understanding how SWOT data might be used to the benefit of operational water management. The modeling framework was used in a twin experiment to simulate the \"true\" system state and an ensemble of model states derived using corrupted meteorological forcings. Virtual SWOT observations of reservoir and river levels were assimilated into the model with a repeat cycle of 21 days. The updated state was used to initialize a Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm that computed the optimal reservoir release that meets a minimum flow requirement 300 km downstream of the dam at the entrance of the environmentally sensitive Niger Inner Delta. The data assimilation results indicate that the model updates had a positive effect on estimates of both water level and discharge. The \"persistence\", which describes the duration of the assimilation effect, was clearly improved by integrating a smoother into the assimilation procedure. We compared performances of the MPC with SWOT data assimilation to an open-loop MPC simulation. Results show that the assimilation of SWOT data resulted in substantial improvements in the performances of the Selingue Dam management with a greater ability to meet environmental requirements and a lower volume of water released from the dam.",

            "abstract": "The ionosphere plays an important role in GNSS applications because it influences on the radio wave propagation through out. The ionosphere delay is the biggest error source for satellite navigation systems, but it can be directly measured and mitigated with using dual frequency GNSS receivers. However GNSS signal fading due to electron density gradients and irregularities in the ionosphere can decrease the operational availability of navigation system. The intensity of such irregularities on high and mid latitudes essentially rises during space weather events. For monitoring of the ionospheric irregularities data collected from all available permanent GNSS stations in the Northern Hemisphere are processed and analyzed. Here we used parameters ROT (rate of GPS TEC change) and ROTI (index of ROT) to study the occurrence of TEC fluctuations. ROTI maps are constructed with the grid of 2 deg x 2 deg resolution as a function of the magnetic local time and corrected magnetic latitude. The ROTI maps allow to estimate the overall fluctuation activity and auroral oval evolutions, in general the ROTI values are corresponded to the probability of GPS signals phase fluctuations. There were developed several models in order to represent ionospheric fluctuations and scintillation activity under different geophysical conditions, but they were calibrated with data sets, that did not include GNSS derived data. It is very actual to develop empirical model based on GNSS derived measurements which can represent strong fluctuations of the ionosphere plasma density at high latitudes. The measurements provided by the existing permanent GNSS networks accumulated in order to develop the empirical model of ionospheric irregularities over the Northern hemisphere. As initial data the daily dependences of the ROTI index are used as a function of geomagnetic Local Time on the specific grid. With ROTI index maps it was determined the irregularities oval border and averaging parameter – semi-hemisphere fluctuation index. It was investigated the statistical and correlation dependences between Kp geomagnetic index and parameters that characterized the ionosphere irregularities activity for period of 2010 – 2014 years. The results of observations for specific events, modeling and its validation will be presented.",

            "abstract": "I review multi-scale multi-signal seismological results on structure and earthquake properties within and around the San Jacinto Fault Zone (SJFZ) in southern California. The results are based on data of the southern California and ANZA networks covering scales from a few km to over 100 km, additional near-fault seismometers and linear arrays with instrument spacing 25-50 m that cross the SJFZ at several locations, and a dense rectangular array with >1100 vertical-component nodes separated by 10-30 m centered on the fault. The structural studies utilize earthquake data to image the seismogenic sections and ambient noise to image the shallower structures. The earthquake studies use waveform inversions and additional time domain and spectral methods. We observe pronounced damage regions with low seismic velocities and anomalous Vp/Vs ratios around the fault, and clear velocity contrasts across various sections. The damage zones and velocity contrasts produce fault zone trapped and head waves at various locations, along with time delays, anisotropy and other signals. The damage zones follow a flower-shape with depth; in places with velocity contrast they are offset to the stiffer side at depth as expected for bimaterial ruptures with persistent propagation direction. Analysis of PGV and PGA indicates clear persistent directivity at given fault sections and overall motion amplification within several km around the fault. Clear temporal changes of velocities, probably involving primarily the shallow material, are observed in response to seasonal, earthquake and other loadings. Full source tensor properties of M>4 earthquakes in the complex trifurcation area include statistically-robust small isotropic component, likely reflecting dynamic generation of rock damage in the source volumes. The dense fault zone instruments record seismic \"noise\" at frequencies >200 Hz that can be used for imaging and monitoring the shallow material with high space and time details, and numerous minute local earthquakes that contribute to the high frequency \"noise\". Updated results will be presented in the meeting.\n*The studies have been done in collaboration with Frank Vernon, Amir Allam, Dimitri Zigone, Zach Ross, Gregor Hillers, Ittai Kurzon, Michel Campillo, Philippe Roux, Lupei Zhu, Dan Hollis, Mitchell Barklage and others.",

            "abstract": "Silicon and carbon cycling are related both on short time scales via the uptake of carbon dioxide and dissolved silica (DSi) by diatoms, and on geological time scales via weathering of silicate rocks consuming carbon dioxide. Long-term changes in oceanic silicon cycling and DSi concentration have been mostly attributed to the evolution of siliceous organisms, especially the colonization of the surface waters by diatoms and their diversification. Thus, impacts of geological mechanisms and changes in carbon cycling have been, in our opinion, overlooked. During the past decade, progress has been made in using silicon isotopes in marine archives to investigate the paleo-silicon cycle. Silicon isotope fractionation in siliceous sponges is closely related to ambient DSi concentration. It follows from this relationship that sponge spicules from marine sediment cores provide a good proxy for reconstructing the paleo-DSi concentration and isotopic composition. The Paleogene period (65.5 to 23Ma) is highly relevant for studying the long-term silicon and carbon cycling relationship due to radiance of diatoms, high variability in the carbon cycle and initiation of the Himalayan orogeny.\nHere, we will present a sponge spicules and radiolarian silicon isotopes record from ODP Leg 171B (Blake Nose, Western North Atlantic) spanning most of the Paleogene. Our data show similar patterns in both foraminiferal carbon and spicule silicon stable isotopes, providing information on the mechanisms coupling the long-term silicon and carbon cycle.",

            "abstract": "We observed diffusive-convection favorable thermohaline staircases directly beneath George VI Ice Shelf, Antarctica. A thermohaline staircase is one of the most pronounced manifestations of double-diffusive convection. Cooling and freshening of the ocean by melting ice produce cool, fresh water above the warmer, saltier water, the water mass distribution favorable to a type of double-diffusive convection known as diffusive convection. While the vertical distribution of water masses can be susceptible to diffusive convection, none of the observations beneath ice shelves so far have shown signals of this process and its effect on melting ice shelves is uncertain. The melt rate of ice shelves is commonly estimated using a parameterization based on three equations model, which assumes a fully-developed, unstratified-turbulent flow over hydraulically smooth surfaces. These pre-requisites are clearly not met in the presence of a thermohaline staircase. We estimate the basal melt rate by applying an existing heat flux parameterization for diffusive convection in conjunction with our measurements of oceanic conditions at one site beneath George VI Ice Shelf. Our estimates yield a possible range of melt rates between 0.1 and 1.3 m/yr, where the observed melt rate of this site is ~1.4 m/yr. Limitations of the formulation and implications of diffusive convection beneath ice shelves are discussed.",

            "abstract": "The fragmentation of forests is occurring at an accelerated rate in parts of the United States. Forest fragmentation creates edge habitat that affects the biogeochemistry of forests. Atmospheric deposition is known to increase at the forest edge in comparison to the forest interior. Past research has demonstrated the critical role of edge effects on throughfall chemistry but no known work has examined the relationship between stemflow chemistry and edge effects. To fill this data gap, we quantified the stemflow acid neutralization capacity (ANC) of nineteen Liriodendron tulipifera L. (yellow poplar) trees between forest edge and interior locations in the Piedmont of the mid-Atlantic USA. ANC was measured directly by potentiometric titration. Both stemflow pH and ANC were higher for L. tulipifera trees on the forest edge as opposed to those in interior locations (p < 0.01), although marked variability was observed among individual trees. It is critical to note that the ANC of stemflow of edge trees is almost certainly contextual, depending on geographic locality. This is to say that stemflow from edge trees may neutralize acid inputs in some locations (as in our case) but lead to enhanced acidification of aqueous inputs to forest soils in other locales where the dry deposition of acid anions is high. The experimental results have ramifications for forest management schema seeking to increase or decrease the extent of edge habitat in forest fragments.",

            "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess potential impacts of climate change on maize and wheat yields in the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia. We considered effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 and changes in rainfall during the main (Kiremt) and the short (Belg) rain and cropping seasons. Crop yield simulations were made with the FAO AquaCrop model using baseline climate data and climate change scenarios projected by the ECHAM5 General Circulation Model under A2 (high) and B1 (low) emission scenarios. The MarkSimGCM daily weather generator was used to generate projected daily values of precipitation and temperature. The projected rainfall during Kiremt shows an increase by about 12-69% while projected Belg rainfall decreases by up to 68%. The mean onset of the Belg cropping season for maize is projected to be delayed by 2-9 weeks and the mean cessation is expected to be extended by more than a month in sub-humid/humid areas of the CRV. In most of the sub-humid/humid areas, the 90 day maize and wheat growing periods will not have dry spells lasting longer than 10 consecutive days. However, in the semiarid areas dry spells could last longer than 15 days. The mean simulated maize yield increased by up to 30% due to changes in the projected seasonal rainfall alone, and by up to 14% due to elevated CO2 alone. The combined effect of elevated CO2 and projected climate factors increased maize yields by up to 59% in sub-humid/humid areas, but resulted in a decrease of up to 46% in the semiarid areas. Wheat yield showed no significant response to the projected rainfall changes, but increased by up to 40% due to elevated CO2. Our results suggest that climate change will increase crop yields in the sub humid/humid regions of the CRV. However, in semi-arid areas the overall projected climate change will affect the yield negatively.",

There is conflicting evidence as to whether the SST gradient and Walker Circulation have strengthened or weakened over the late 20th century. We present new records of SST and sea surface salinity (SSS) spanning 1959-2010 based on paired measurements of Sr/Ca and d18O in a massive Porites coral from Butaritari atoll in the Gilbert Islands, Republic of Kiribati, in the central-western equatorial Pacific. The records show 2-7 year variability correlated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and corresponding shifts in the extent of the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool, and decadal-scale signals related to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. In addition, the Butaritari coral records reveal a small but significant increase in SST (0.39˚C) from 1959 to 2010 with no accompanying change in SSS, a trend that persists even when ENSO variability is removed. In contrast, larger increases in SST and SSS are evident in coral records from the equatorial Pacific Line Islands, located east of Butaritari. Taken together, the equatorial Pacific coral records suggest an overall reduction in the east-west SST and SSS gradient over the last several decades, and a recent weakening of the Walker Circulation.",

            "abstract": "Recently, the 2014 MW=8.1 Pisagua earthquake ruptured a substantial part of the Northern Chile seismic gap north of 21°S. We present data from a temporary local seismic network that was in operation in this region between 2005 and 2012, in the phase of late interseismic locking.\nWe localized over 5,300 seismic events (ML ∼0.5–4) with high precision using hand-picked seismic arrival times. Seismicity is pervasive within the entire crust of the South American continental plate. In the subducting slab the seismicity exhibits three distinct bands of activity. The highest concentration is found in a sharp band at the contact zone between the continental and the oceanic lithosphere. Here it constraints the transitionally locked zone between 30 and 50 km depth. A second band is visible near the oceanic Moho and a third one in the lithospheric mantle of the subducting plate, 30km below the plate contact. Seismicity tightly correlates with the reflectivity image acquired in the ANCORP '96 experiment.\nWe complement our observations with the determination of local seismic P- to S-wave velocity ratios (Vp/Vs) that we determined in full independence of the localization procedure following the approach of Lin and Shearer (2007). Along the plate contact we observe a clear down-dip decrease of Vp/Vs from high values (>1.80) in the shallow part (~30km depth) to moderate values (~1.70) in the deeper part of the system (~90km). Locally very high or very low Vp/Vs occur (>1.90 or ~1.60, respectively). The continental crust exhibits rather typical Vp/Vs (~1.75). Towards the trench we find a continuation of high Vp/Vs from the subducting slab into the lower continental crust. Arc-ward of the down-dip end of interplate seismicity, below the continental Moho as constrained by receiver functions, we find very low Vp/Vs (~1.60). In the oceanic mantle we observe high Vp/Vs (~1.90) at a depth between 50 and 60km.\nFluids and serpentine are prominent candidates to explain anomalously high Vp/Vs. Values as found at the plate contact between 30 and 40km depth may therefore witness the presence of free fluids there. A migration of these fluids into the overriding continental plate would be consistent with our data. In case of the oceanic mantle, the degree of serpentinization of peridotite may be estimated, constraining the water budget of the down-going plate.",

            "abstract": "Aboveground biomass (AGB) plays an essential role in ecosystem research, global cycles, and is of vital importance in climate studies. AGB accumulated in the forests is of special monitoring interest as it contains the most of biomass comparing with other land biomes. The largest of the land biomes is boreal forest, which has a substantial carbon accumulation capability; carbon stock estimated to be 272 +/-23 Pg C (32%) [1]. Russian’s forests are of particular concern, due to the largest source of uncertainty in global carbon stock calculations [1], and old inventory data that have not been updated in the last 25 years [2].\nIn this research new empirical models for AGB estimation are proposed. Using radar L-band data for AGB retrieval and optical data for an update of in situ data the processing scheme was developed. The approach was trained and validated in the Asian part of the boreal forest, in southern Russian Central Siberia; two Siberian Federal Districts: Krasnoyarsk Kray and Irkutsk Oblast. Together the training and testing forest territories cover an area of approximately 3,500 km2.\nALOS PALSAR L-band single (HH – horizontal transmitted and received) and dual (HH and HV – horizontal transmitted, horizontal and vertical received) polarizations in Single Look Complex format (SLC) were used to calculate backscattering coefficient in gamma nought and coherence. In total more than 150 images acquired between 2006 and 2011 were available. The data were obtained through the ALOS Kyoto and Carbon Initiative Project (K&C). The data were used to calibrate a randomForest algorithm. Additionally, a simple linear and multiple-regression approach was used. The uncertainty of the AGB estimation at pixel and stand level were calculated approximately as 35% by validation against an independent dataset. The previous studies employing ALOS PALSAR data over boreal forests reported uncertainty of 39.4% using randomForest approach [2] or 42.8% using semi-empirical approach [3].",

            "abstract": "MJO is often considered a convectively-coupled wave. The present talk is going to argue that it is best understood primarily as a nonlinear solitary wave dominated by vorticity. Role of convection is secondary,\nthough likely catalytic.\nAccording to Charney's (1963) scale analysis, the large-scale tropical circulations are nondivergent to the leading order, i.e., dominated by rotational flows. Yano et al (2009) demonstrate indeed that is the case for a period dominated by three MJO events. The scale analysis of Yano and Bonazzola (2009, JAS) demonstrates such an asymptotically nondivergent regime is a viable alternative to the traditionally-believed equatorial-wave regime. Wedi and Smolarkiewicz (2010, JAS) in turn, show by numerical computations of a dry system that a MJO-like oscillation for a similar period can indeed be generated by free solitary nonlinear equatorial Rossby-wave dynamics\nwithout any convective forcing to a system.\nUnfortunately, this perspective is slow to be accepted with people's mind so much fixed on the role of convection. This situation may be compared to a slow historical process of acceptance of Eady and Charney's baroclinic\ninstability simply because it does not invoke any convection\nIronically, once the nonlinear free-wave view for MJO is accepted, interpretations can more easily be developed for a recent series of numerical model experiments under a global channel configuration over\nthe tropics with a high-resolution of 5-50 km with or without convection parameterization.\nAll those experiments tend to reproduce observed large-scale circulations associated with MJO rather well, though most of time, they fail to reproduce convective coherency associated with MJO.\nThese large-scale circulations appear to be generated by lateral forcing imposed at the latitudinal walls. These lateral boundaries are reasonably far enough (30NS) to induce any direct influence to the tropics. There is no linear dry equatorial wave that supports this period either. In Wedi and Smolarkiewicz's analysis, such a lateral forcing is essential in order to obtain their nonlinear solitary wave solution. Thus is the leading-order solution for MJO in the same sense as the linear baroclinic instability is a leading-order solution to the midlatitude synoptic-scale storm.",

            "abstract": "Biomass burning is an important source of particulates and trace gases and a major element of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Well constrained emissions from open vegetation fires in both time and space are needed to model direct and indirect effect of biomass burning aerosols, homogeneous and heterogeneous chemistry in the atmosphere and perform credible integrated earth system analysis, climate and air pollution studies. However representing fires in regional and global numerical models is challenging because of the subgrid scales at which fire processes operate. An example of apparent discrepancy in scales is the use of monthly- or seasonal-mean fire emissions which given the stochastic nature of fires means that at certain spatial scales the temporal behavior of emissions becomes influenced by individual fire events and becomes more variable. The present study aims at investigating the impact of monthly-mean fire emissions on direct and indirect aerosol effects. Key element of our work is the use of fire radiative power (FRP) based emissions and a global fully interactive cloud-aerosol-radiation modeling system.\nWe used the Goddard Earth Observing System Model, Version 5 (GEOS-5) with two moment cloud microphysics and explicit cloud droplet activation and ice nucleation. GEOS-5 is coupled with an online version of the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) model. Biomass burning emissions used in this study are from the Quick Fire Emission Dataset (QFED) available daily at up to 0.1 degrees horizontal resolution. We performed experiments with daily-mean and monthly-mean QFED emissions at two degree horizontal resolutions and report differences in aerosol burden and radiative forcing, for example we found that regional differences of clear-sky aerosol direct radiative effect at the surface and at the top of the atmosphere in MAM and JJA can be as high as 4 Wm-2 and 3 Wm-2, respectively.",

            "abstract": "The Opportunity Mars rover wheels overturned two adjacent rocks and exposed underlying fracture-filling deposits while exploring the Murray Ridge rim segment of the Noachian-aged Endeavour Crater. These two small rocks, Pinnacle Island (~4 cm across) and Stuart Island (ranging from ~3 to 8 cm wide and ~10 cm long), were subsequently examined in detail to determine the textures, spectral reflectances (0.4 to 1.0 µm), and compositions of the fracture-filling materials. Relatively bright materials with a composition enriched in Mg, Fe, and S, and spectral features indicative of hydrated sulfates, are overlain with a dark, purple mineral phase or phases with a composition enriched in Mn, Ni, P, and Ca, all relative to underlying bedrock. Reflectance spectra for the dark, purple material are consistent with the presence of one or more Mn-oxide phases. Results indicate two aqueous events, one to deposit the Fe and Mg-rich sulfates, and one to deposit the Mn-rich mineral(s), perhaps with scavenging of Ni from the fluid. Ca and P-rich phases (e.g., Ca-phosphates) co-precipitated with Mn-bearing mineral(s) or were incorporated into one or more of them. Mixing of reducing ground waters with an oxidizing atmosphere or other waters likely produced both the S and Mn-enriched deposits. Oxidation of Mn, in particular, requires a very high potential oxidant relative to what is required for S or Fe oxidation. This suggests oxidation by O2 or species derived from O2. Mn-oxide phases would have provided highly favorable substrates for microbial respiration, making this period of aqueous flow through the fractures a potentially habitable environment. These results add to the evolving story of aqueous alteration of Endeavour’s rim rocks, including evidence for nontronite, montmorillonite, Ca-sulfate-rich veins, and hematitic concretions.",

            "abstract": "A number of paleomagnetic studies based on Alternating Field (AF) demagnetization of lunar samples have recently shown that the Moon had a dynamo magnetic field of several tens of μT at 4.2 Ga, 3.72 Ga, 3.56 Ga, and that the field had declined to below a few μT by 3.2 Ga. Although uncertainties associated with AF-derived paleointensity estimates are up to a factor of 3, these values are too high to be explained by current lunar dynamo models: based on estimates of the power available to drive a dynamo in the early history of the Moon, it is expected that the field intensity should have been of the order of a few μT. Thermal demagnetization-based techniques such as the Thellier-Thellier paleointensity method have much lower uncertainties on the paleofield, but attempts have consistently failed due to alteration of the metal-bearing lunar samples when heated. We have recently designed the first system to conduct thermal demagnetization with oxygen fugacity control using mixtures of H2 and CO2to mitigate alteration. We are applying this method to the following lunar samples:\n- Regolith breccia 15498. Impact melt from this breccia acquired a magnetization at 1.0-1.3 Ga. We conducted a Thellier-Thellier paleointensity experiment in a controlled atmosphere with oxygen fugacity at IW-1 log(atm). pTRM checks indicate that alteration is negligible up to 500°C. A paleointensity of 3.2 μT is obtained for the origin-trending high-temperature (>250°C) component. This is consistent with estimates based on AF-demagnetization data.\n- Troctolite 76535. A single plagioclase crystal from 4.2 Gyr-old troctolite 76535 was thermally demagnetized in a controlled atmosphere with oxygen fugacity at IW-1 log(atm). The synchrotron transmission X-ray microscopy and hysteresis parameters show that the major magnetization carriers are fine-grained pseudo-single domain metal inclusions. Due to the small size and weak magnetization of the sample (natural remanent magnetization (NRM) ~5x10-12 Am2), measurements are performed with a SQUID microscope. The NRM is stable in direction and intensity up to 450°C, and rapidly decays between 450°C and 550°C. Partial TRM (pTRM) acquisitions were performed at 450°C and 550°C. Based on this limited data, a paleofield of at least 45 μT is obtained, which is consistent with estimates given by AF methods.",

            "abstract": "Detailed rainfall spatial distribution plays an important role in various applications of hydrological management such as flood forecasting or recharge estimation. However, limited rain gauge network density often makes it difficult to characterize the small-scale variability of rainfall, and reduces the reliability of interpolations methods such as kriging.\nHere, we test a non-parametric technique that produces spatial rainfall fields by relying on time series data rather than dense spatial data sets. If the velocity of the rain cells is known, the time series can be projected into a one-dimensional space, reflecting the same type of variability observable in the direction of the rain cell displacement.\nAssuming spatio-temporal ergodicity for a small area, we estimate the mean rainfall cells displacement direction i and velocity vi by optimizing the cross correlation between two subsequent radar images at time t and t+dt. Then, given a time series in the same time lapse R([t,...,t+dt]) and applying the linear transformation R([t,...,t+dt])=S([t,...,t+dt]vi), we obtain a spatial series S generally more densely informed than the available rain-gauge network, used to represent the spatial variability in the direction i. For example, from a 1 min spaced time series R and an estimated velocity v=20 km/h, we obtain a 333 m spaced series S.\nThe obtained spatial series are then employed as a basis to generate 2D spatial rainfall fields using the Direct Sampling (DS), a multiple-point technique that allows simulating complex statistical relations by respecting the similarity of multiple scales patterns. Here the DS is used to complete the 2D field by reproducing one-dimensional patterns borrowed from the spatial series.\nThe approach is tested on the rain-gauge network of the Swiss plateau (Switzerland) and on radar data for the same region. The proposed technique has the potential to characterize realistic spatial fields even for sparse observation networks.",

            "abstract": "Mercury is surrounded by a surface-bounded exosphere with six known components: H, He, Na, K, Ca, and Mg. Of these components, Ca is of extreme temperature and has been observed in Mercury's exosphere for the past decade, after its discovery by Bida et al. (2000) from observations with the Keck telescope on Mauna Kea. Observations of the Ca exosphere by MESSENGER show a source concentrated on the dawn side. The time variation in that Ca signal repeats every Mercury year (Burger et al., 2014). Figure 1 shows how the Ca source rate varies with true anomaly angle, ν, which is the planet's orbital longitude measured from the direction of periapse. We suspect that these variations are due to impact vaporization resulting from infalling interplanetary dust. Our models of this scenario show that much of the seasonal variation in Ca is due to Mercury's substantial radial motion through the interplanetary dust cloud that results from Mercury's large orbital eccentricity (e=0.2). The seasonal Ca variation is enhanced further by Mercury's large orbital inclination (7° relative to the ecliptic), which causes additional periodic variations in the dust infall rate as Mercury's vertical motion carries it repeatedly across the dust-disk's midplane. Note also the strong Ca enhancement near ν~20° (Fig 1) which requires an additional source of localized dust. The location of that peak is close to (but not precisely coincident with) Mercury's orbital longitude as it crosses the orbital plane of comet 2P/Encke.\nBida, T.A. et al., 2000.

The magnitude and direction of the semi-direct effect from BBA is sensitive to many factors, including relative altitudes of cloud and BBA and the optical properties of BBA. During September 2012 the SAMBBA (South American Biomass Burning Analysis) field campaign took place, during which the UK BAe146 aircraft performed measurements of BBA and cloud properties over the Amazon. Properties of BBA were found to vary over different burning regimes (forest vs cerrado/tropical savannah), with single scattering albedo at 550nm being notably lower in the east over cerrado (<0.85) compared to in the west over forest burning fires (>0.9). We present results from the HadGEM3 climate model, where we vary the presence and optical properties of BBA emitted over the South American region to determine how sensitive regional climate and the atmospheric circulation are to BBA properties.",

            "abstract": "Assessment of the sensitivity of surface mass balance and equilibrium line altitude to climate change is crucial for the simulation of the future evolution of glaciers. Such an assessment has been carried out using a very extensive data set comprising numerous measurements of snow accumulation and snow and ice ablation made on four French glaciers over the last 16 years. Winter mass balances show a complicated pattern with respect to altitude, showing no clear linear relationship. Although the ratios of winter mass balance to valley precipitation differ considerably from one site to another, they remain relatively constant over time. Relationships between snow/ice ablation and temperature are stable, showing no link with altitude. The mean snow and ice PDD factors found are 0.003 and 0.0061 m w.e. °C-1 d-1. This analysis shows that, at a given site, ablation depends mainly on the amount of snow precipitation and on cumulative positive degree days. The sensitivity of annual ablation to temperature change increases almost linearly from 0.25 m w.e. °C-1 at 3500 m to 1.55 m w.e. °C-1 at 1650 m. Equilibrium line altitude sensitivity to temperature change was found to ranges from 50 m °C-1 to 85 m °C-1, generally lower than previous studies.",

In late July 2014 four Seagliders were deployed in the Beaufort Sea to follow the retreat of the MIZ. Sampling in open water, through the MIZ and under the ice is expected through mid-September, with gliders navigating under ice from moored acoustic sound sources embedded in the MIZ autonomous observing array. The sensor suite carried by Seagliders include temperature, temperature microstructure, salinity, oxygen, chlorophyll fluorescence, optical backscatter, and multi-spectral downwelling irradiance. A rigorous sensor inter-calibration program with simultaneous ship CTD and glider profiles is an essential component of glider deployment and recovery protocol, as well as during opportunistic glider encounters with the IBRV Araon during August. Ship-based water sampling will allow construction of regional libraries of optical proxies for chlorophyll, pigment spectral absorption coefficient, and particulate organic carbon. Since irradiance under the ice is dependent on ice thickness and presence of melt ponds and leads, phytoplankton distribution is expected to vary spatially. Both the vertical and horizontal distributions of pigment spectral absorption coefficients are expected to play a role in the feedback between phytoplankton and ice melt. Glider data will allow us to apply a light and chlorophyll primary productivity model to estimate and compare phytoplankton productivity under various ice-cover and ice-free conditions.",

            "abstract": "Ice cores from the Tibetan Plateau provide high-resolution records of changes in the snow and ice isotopic composition. In the monsoon sector of southern Tibetan Plateau, their climatic interpretation has been controversial. Here, we present a new high-resolution δ18O record obtained from 2206 measurements performed at 2-3 cm depth resolution along a 55.1 m depth ice core retrieved from the Noijinkansang glacier (NK, 5950 m a.s.l.), and spanning the period 1864 to 2006. The data depict high δ18O levels in the 19th century, in the 1910s, 1960s, a drop in the late 1970s and a recent increasing trend. The comparison with regional meteorological data and with a simulation performed with the LMDZiso general circulation model leads to the attributing of the abrupt shift in the late 1970s predominantly to changes in regional atmospheric circulation rather than to changes in local temperature. Correlation analyses suggest that the large-scale modes of variability (PDO and ENSO) play important roles in modulating NK δ18O changes. The NK δ18O minimum at the end of the 1970s coincides with a PDO phase shift, an inflexion point of the zonal index as well as ENSO, implying interdecadal modelation of the PDO/ENSO on the influence of the Indian monsoon on southern TP precipitation δ18O. While convective activity above North India controls the intra-seasonal variability of precipitation δ18O in southern TP, other processes associated with changes in large-scale atmospheric circulation act at the inter-annual scale.",

            "abstract": "Dynamic processes occurring in the mantle and core interact at the core-mantle boundary (CMB), which marks the largest thermal and compositional interface inside the Earth. This interplay has produced a myriad of complex structures in the lowermost mantle that offer valuable insights into the dynamics of this region. Large-low-shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs) dominate shear wave velocity (Vs) models of the deep mantle. In addition, global tomography studies generally find an increase in the ratio of shear wave to compressional wave velocity (Vp) variations, accompanied by a significant anti-correlation between shear wave and bulk sound velocity (Vc) variations. These seismic characteristics, also observed in the recent SP12RTS tomographic model, have primarily been interpreted in terms of chemical variations but could potentially also be explained by the presence of the deep mantle post-perovskite (pPv) phase.\nIn this contribution, we attempt to interpret the observed seismic characteristics by linking them to dynamic processes occurring in the deep mantle. For this purpose, we compare the shear and compressional wave velocity structure of SP12RTS to mantle structure derived from geodynamic models of mantle convection. We project the geodynamic models into the SP12RTS model parametrization and use its resolution operator to account for the limited tomographic resolution. We include geodynamic models with and without the post-perovskite phase and/or chemical variations and in addition vary the CMB temperature. Although the reparametrization and tomographic filtering significantly affect the obtained mantle structure, we demonstrate that the patterns observed in the ratios and correlations of seismic velocities are robust features. Our tomographic-geodynamic model comparison suggests that the seismic characteristics can be explained by the presence of post-perovskite but it allows no discrimination between isochemical and thermochemical models of mantle convection.",

            "abstract": "Collisionless shock waves are ubiquitous in the universe and fundamental to understanding the nature of collisionless plasmas. The interplay between particles (ions and electrons) and fields (electromagnetic) introduces a variety of both physical and geometrical parameters such as Mach numbers (e.g. MA, Mf), β, and θbn. These vary drastically from terrestrial to astrophysical regimes resulting in radically different characteristics of shocks. This poses two complexities. Firstly, separating the influences of these parameters on physical mechanisms such as energy dissipation. Secondly, correlating observations of shock waves over a wide range of each parameter, enough to span across different regimes. Investigating the latter has been restricted since the majority of studies on shocks at exotic regimes (such as supernova remnants) have been achieved either remotely or via simulations, but rarely by means of in-situ observations. It is not clear what happens in the higher MA regime. Here we show the parameter space of MA for all bow shock crossings from 2004-2012 as measured by the Cassini spacecraft. We found that the Saturnian bow shock exhibits characteristics akin to both terrestrial and astrophysical regimes (MA of order 100), which is principally controlled by the upstream magnetic field strength. Moreover, we estimated the θbn­ of each crossing and were able to further constrain the sample into categories of similar features. Our results demonstrate how MA plays a central role in controlling the onset of physical mechanisms in collisionless shocks, particularly instabilities, non-time stationarity and electron acceleration. We anticipate our comprehensive assessment to give deeper insight to high MA collisionless shocks and provide a broader scope for understanding the structures and mechanisms of collisionless shocks. This can potentially bridge the gap between more modest MA observed in near-Earth space and more exotic astrophysical regimes where shock processes play central roles.",

            "abstract": "Mantle convection is a non-linear system. Convection patterns are therefore not directly proportional to initialization parameters. We investigate which parameters affect convection evolution, and the timescales over which these effects are observable. To do this, we run thousands of mantle convection simulations, each model having different, randomly selected, thermal, rheological, and compositional starting parameters. Our convection program is StagYY, run in 2D spherical-annulus geometry with self-consistent mineral physics properties calculated in Perple_X. StagYY allows melting and basaltic crust production and includes decaying radiogenic heat production in both core and mantle.\nAt various timesteps after initiation, the temperature, density, and composition fields can be extracted. We train neural networks to find the most likely initial parameters responsible for any convection pattern. The networks produce probability density functions, so that the relative likelihood of any value of the inputs parameters can be calculated, allowing inversion of the non-linear convection systems. This means that the uncertainty of the result is also provided.\nAfter two billion years, we can find initial mantle potential temperature, initial CMB temperature, approximated initial mantle composition, reference viscosity, depth dependent viscosity, yield stress and the existence and thickness of any initial layer of primordial material. Our results suggest that the signal from these initialisation parameters is retained in the pattern of convection for much longer than 2 Gy. Our ultimate goal is to use tomographic models of the real mantle to investigate the ‘initialisation’ parameters of the Earth. We can also apply the same methodology to back-step convection, allowing us to build up a history of Earth’s mantle convection.",

Data suggest that magnetic carriers within the Murchison meteorite were grown in a paleofield of 450 - 850 nT.

            "abstract": "We develop a 3-D thermal model for a margin segment that extends from the southern Kuril Islands to NE Japan, using a realistic geometry for the subducting Pacific plate, and investigate the effect of 3-D mantle wedge flow on the mantle wedge temperature and its relation to the distribution of arc volcanoes. Mantle wedge flow is driven largely by viscous coupling between the subducting slab and the overlying mantle, and its flow pattern is influenced by the geometry of the subducting slab and the subduction direction relative to the trench. Along the southern Kuril-NE Japan margin, the slab takes a complex geometry with varying subduction obliquity. The 3-D modeling results show that in NE Japan, the directions of the mantle wedge in-flow and out-flow are E-W, nearly parallel to the subduction direction. However, in southern Kuril, due to oblique subduction, the mantle flows in from NE, obliquely to the subduction direction, and flows out parallel to the subduction direction. These mantle wedge flow patterns are consistent with those inferred from the measured seismic anisotropy of the mantle wedge. The predicted inflow directions in both NE Japan and southern Kuril correlate well with the E-W and NE-SW orientations of cross-arc chains, respectively, indicating that the cross-chain orientation may be guided by the mantle inflow direction. In southern Kuril, obliquity subduction and steeper slab dip results in slightly cooler mantle wedge than in Tohoku at shallow depths (<100 km depth). Further, the northerly mantle inflow in southern Kuril and the westerly inflow in NE Japan converge in the hinge zone where the slab bends to accommodate a dip direction change between southern Kuril and NE Japan, discouraging mantle inflow within the hinge zone and causing the mantle wedge to be relatively cold. The slab surface depths beneath the frontal volcanoes in southern Kuril and NE Japan are about 120 km and 100 km, respectively. The along-arc variation in the mantle wedge temperature likely affects the locations of melt generation and frontal volcanoes. We qualitatively examine whether the correlations between arc location, cross-chain orientation, slab geometry, and subduction obliquity that are found in southern Kuril and NE Japan are present elsewhere.",

            "abstract": "A recent publication suggests that there is a consistent temperature dependency of methane fluxes across ecosystems and scales. Strong correlations between methane flux and ecosystem temperature have been reported in numerous studies over the last three decades. However, while the correlation is high, even when combining data for many different ecosystems and scales, it does necessarily follow that the relationship in each ecosystem or at each scale are the same. A robust measure for ‘consistency’ would be to show that the parameters among the flux-temperature relationship parameters (i.e. slope and intercept) for each ecosystem and scale are not statistical different for different. Examining the statistical parameters of this relationship across numerous wetlands (one ecosystem type) show there is little consistency – the form of the function is universal but the application of the function is not. For example, across many northern peatland, while the slope of the relationship between flux and temperature are somewhat similar the intercepts are very different. These differences have been attributed to structural differences in the ecosystems – i.e. plant communities, and environmental conditions such as moisture content and nutrient availability. Peatlands that are being influenced by climate change, particularly those associated with thawing permafrost, the slope of the functional relationship between methane and temperature changes as the plant community structure and ecosystem productivity change. Also the time scales over which methane emission and ecosystem production correlate vary depending on the plant communities involved. The distinction between a generalized association between methane and temperature and a consistent function that could be used across ecosystems and scale is important for the simulation of methane emissions.",

            "abstract": "We will present an analysis of the rheology of mantle lithosphere based on extrapolation of lab-based flow laws, microstructural characterization of mantle shear zones and xenoliths, and the spatial distribution of mantle earthquakes and seismic anisotropy. As a starting point, we illustrate the similarity in the evolution of olivine lattice preferred orientation (LPO) for cm-scale lab samples (e.g., Zhang et al., 2000) and 100 meter-scale shear zones (e.g., Warren et al., 2008; Skemer et al., 2010). This correlation provides strong support for the extrapolation of lab data in both time and scale. The extrapolation of these results to plate-scale processes is supported by the analysis of shear wave splitting across the Alpine Fault on the South Island of New Zealand and its surrounding ocean basins (Zietlow et al., 2014). For the same region, the similarity in the fast Pn azimuth with the fast shear wave polarization directions indicates high strain deformation of relatively cold (~500-700oC) mantle lithosphere across a region 100-200 km wide (Collins and Molnar, 2014). This latter observation suggests that the lithosphere is significantly weaker than predicted by the extrapolation of dislocation creep or Peierls creep flow laws. Weakening via promotion of grain size sensitive creep mechanisms (diffusion creep and DisGBS) is likely at these conditions; however, studies of exhumed mantle shear zones generally indicate that the activation of these processes leads to strain localization at scales <<200 km. These observations motivate us to consider rheological constraints derived from geodetic studies and earthquake depths in regions where deformation of the lithosphere occurs at similar conditions. At face value, these data provide additional support for the extrapolation of lab data; the depth extent of earthquakes is consistent with estimates for the conditions where a transition from stable to unstable frictional sliding occurs (e.g., Boettcher et al., 2007) – and microstructures in xenoliths from actively deforming regions of the lithosphere constrain viscosities similar to those derived from analyses of post-seismic creep (e.g., Behr and Hirth, 2014). We will report on our continued effort to reconcile the apparent discrepancies presented by these studies.",

            "abstract": "Trace metal enrichments in sedimentary deposits are related to the processes also controlling production and preservation of organic matter (e.g. Brumsack, 2006; Tribovillard et al., 2006). Consequently, trace metals have been used in reconstructions of the depositional environment of organic-rich deposits, however most of these studies focused mainly on the redox chemistry of these trace metals. Here we present the results of a comprehensive database that has been constructed for comparing trace metal concentrations in modern organic-rich sediments from a variety of different marine settings. This database allows us to define proxies that effectively differentiate between two fundamentally different settings with enhanced organic-carbon burial: continental margin upwelling areas (e.g. Namibian Margin) and hydrographically restricted marginal marine basins (e.g. Black Sea). It is observed that relatively high Cd/Mo values are typical for samples from upwelling settings whereas Co*Mn values are relatively high in samples from restricted basins. Cd/Mo ratios are thought to reflect the relative influence of productivity versus preservation on organic carbon accumulation, in which high values in productivity driven systems (i.e. upwelling) are attributed to the enhanced transfer of Cd to the sediment by incorporation of Cd into plankton biomass. Co*Mn, on the other hand, might be used to assess circulation patterns and the relative contribution of sub-surface versus surface/river water and/or dust influx to the basin, because of the differences in the supply and reactive behaviour of Co and Mn in the water column. As both independent parameters show similar discriminating behaviour, it is proposed that cross-plotting Cd/Mo and Co*Mn provides a highly effective way to distinguish sediments deposited in upwelling versus restricted settings.",

            "abstract": "We took advantage of the World Digital Magnetic Anomaly Map (WDMAM) to estimate the depth to the bottom of the magnetic basement (DBMB) in South America and Caribbean region. To achieve this, we performed three different spectral methods and chose the model showing greatest consistent with the geological and geophysical characteristics of the study area. Our results show that the DBMB varies between <2 and 55,7 km. Values less than 2 km predominate in Pacific and Atlantic offshore zones, which increase to maximum values of 20 km in the Caribbean Sea basin. Regarding the onshore region, DBMB's range between 12 and 28 km in Central America region, whereas South America exhibits values from 10 to 55,7 km. The highest values (>40 km) of the study area occur as a continuous belt that matches the Andes Cordillera in a zone between the latitudes 8,7° S and 32,6° S, with a width varying from 150 to 520 km.\nAfter comparing our results with data on MOHO depth available for the study area, we found that the calculated DBMB's lie above the MOHO in most of the area. This implies that our depths can be correlated with the Curie Point depth, that is, the transition from magnetic to non-magnetic rocks is due to an increase in temperature up to the Curie Temperature. On the other hand, in areas like Northeastern and Southern Llanos Basin, Solimoes Basin, Familina Province, Chaco Basin and some sectors in Andean Foreland Basins, our DMBM's are still shallower than Moho but with differences not exceeding 5 km. In this case, it is likely that the bottom of the magnetic basement merely corresponds to the compositional change of magnetic material to nonmagnetic represented by MOHO discontinuity",

The contributions of these collisions to overall basin (meso) scale mixing were studied using the MATERHORN field data as well as laboratory measurements conducted under controlled conditions using counter flowing gravity currents. The collisions cause localized shear layers and Kelvin Helmholtz billowing, which, together with turbulence generated by impingement of fronts on one another, generate a turbulence field that decays rapidly under local stable stratification. Buoyancy fluxes measured using these events are parameterized in terms of a suitably defined Richardson number and dimensionless geometric parameters. The time and lengthscales of initial turbulence as well as its decay time scale are measured and quantified using governing parameters. Mechanisms responsible for the recurrence of collision events are elicited based on data from a large number of flux towers, remote sensors and infrared cameras located in the domain of observations.",

The upper layer (~24−33 km) is representative of strongly magnetic Archean terrain granulites, of which the mafic granulites have the highest susceptibility (κ, mean 65.33 × 10−3 SI) and natural remanent magnetization (NRM, mean 0.57 Am−1). The magnetic minerals in the terrain granulites are dominantly coarse granular multi−domain magnetite and ilmenite−hematite solid solution with lamellar texture, which dominate the magnetic properties of the rocks and have > 90% contribution (average ~ 95%) to low-field susceptibility (χferri%, here as the low-field susceptibility subtracting paramagnetic susceptibility) for most of the samples. By contrast, the lowermost layer (~33−42 km) is mainly composed of mafic granulite and pyroxenite as xenoliths, which are weakly magnetic with the κ and NRM of 0.9−1.5 × 10−3 SI and 0.04−0.1 Am−1, respectively. The magnetic properties of xenoliths are controlled by paramagnetic silicates (olivine, pyroxene and feldspar) and small amounts of interstitial fine granular Fe−Ti oxides (e.g. magnetite) and sulfides (e.g. pyrrhotite), of which the χferri% varies between 5% and 90% (average ~ 40%). As continuous underplating of mantle−derived basaltic magma at the prior crust−mantle boundary occurred from the late Mesozoic to Cenozoic (peak at ~120 Ma), a 8−10 km lowermost crust accreted (represented mainly by the weakly pyroxenite and mafic granulite xenoliths), associated with thinning of the old Archean crust and shallow of the original Moho to ~33 km, which is about 10 km away from the new Moho today (~41−42 km). Therefore, we suggest that this model of bilevel magnetic lower crust with varying depth and thickness may exist widespreadly beneath the North China Craton.",

Because of the limited amount of relevant geological and geodetic observations, it is difficult to constrain GIA models for this region. With improved ice sheet models and gravity observations from GRACE, it is possible to better constrain Earth rheology. This study aims to constrain the upper mantle viscosity and elastic lithosphere thickness from GRACE data in the Barents Sea region.\nThe GRACE observations are corrected for current ice melting on Svalbard, Novaya Zemlya and Frans Joseph Land. A secular trend in gravity rate trend is estimated from the CSR release 5 GRACE data for the period of February 2003 to July 2013. Furthermore, long wavelength effects from distant large mass balance signals such as Greenland ice melting are filtered out. A new high-variance set of ice loading histories from calibrated glaciological modeling are used in the GIA modeling as it is found that ICE-5G over-estimates the observed GIA gravity change in the region.\nIt is found that the rheology structure represented by VM5a results in over-estimation of the observed gravity change in the region for all ice sheet chronologies investigated. Therefore, other rheological Earth models were investigated. The best fitting upper mantle viscosity and elastic lithosphere thickness in the Barents Sea region are 4 (±0.5)*10^20 Pas and 110 (±20) km, respectively. The GRACE satellite mission proves to be a useful constraint in the Barents Sea Region for improving our knowledge on the upper mantle rheology.",

We find that in both hemispheres, AltiKa consistently ranges higher than CryoSat-2, as would be intuitively expected for an altimeter operating at a higher frequency. The difference between the freeboard estimated by the two missions changes throughout the growth season, pointing to the role of the evolving snow layer on top of the sea ice floes. The data are also compared with Operation IceBridge airborne laser altimeter data from the 2013 and 2014 campaigns and it is found that AltiKa ranges much closer to the air-snow interface than CryoSat-2. AltiKa provides a new avenue of investigation for the issue of radar altimeter penetration into the snowpack on sea ice and could provide new insights for estimates of sea ice thickness, particularly in the Antarctic where Ku-band altimeters have typically performed badly.",

Early results show that the system development is on track to meet functional and performance requirements to process science data. Comparison of science products generated by the ground system from simulated data with those generated by the algorithm developers show close agreement among data sets which demonstrates that the algorithms are implemented correctly.

            "abstract": "Knowing the time between initial intrusion and later eruption of a given volume of differentiated magma is key to evaluating the connections among magma transport and emplacement, solidification and differentiation, and melt extraction and eruption. Cooling rates for two Kïlauea lava lakes as well as known parent composition and residence times for intrusions that resulted in fractionated lavas later erupted on the East Rift Zone in 1955 (34 years) and 1977 (22 years) allow intrusion dimensions to be calculated. We model intrusions beneath Kïlauea’s East Rift Zone near their point of separation from the magma transport path at ~ 5 km depth using Jaeger’s (1957) method calibrated against Alae and Makaopuhi lava lakes with wallrock temperatures above the curie point at 450-550°C. Minimum thicknesses of 50-70 meters are found for intrusions that fed the two fractionated lavas, as well as for long-lived magma bodies identified from geodetic monitoring during many East Rift eruptions. These intrusions began as dikes, but probably became sills or laccolithic bodies that remained near the transport path. Short-lived intrusions also arrested near the magma transport path, but that retain a dike geometry, are hypothesized to serve as a trigger for the small but discrete increments of seaward movement on Kïlauea’s south flank that characterize slow-slip earthquakes.\nTwo additional thoughts arise from the quantitative modeling of magma cooling. First, long-term heating of the wallrock surrounding the horizontal East Rift Zone transport path slows the rate of cooling within the conduit, possibly contributing to the longevity of the East Rift eruption that began in 1983. Second, the combined effects of heating of the wall rock and ever-increasing magma supply rate from the mantle may have forced breakdown and widening of the vertical transport conduit, which could explain the 5-15-km deep long-period earthquake swarms beneath Kīlauea’s summit between 1987 and 1992.",

            "abstract": "Data from a variety of observational and modeling sources have indicated enhanced, widespread melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) surface in recent years. In 2012, this melting was punctuated by the circumstance on 11 July when almost the entirety of the ice sheet simultaneously experienced surface melt, including Summit. While such an event has been considered as the result of unique meteorological conditions, the melting record for the season also occurred in 2012 based on spatial extent and duration. Previous melt extent records also occurred in 2002, 2007, and 2010. Melt extent may be estimated from remote sensing methods, but runoff volume may only be obtained from select in situ measurement locations or modeling methods. The aim of this study is to assess differences in available estimates of melt extent and runoff volume, and to characterize the spatial and temporal variability of surface melt. Significantly, the evaluation is conducted over the full available period from 1980 to the present, rather than focusing on one event. The GEOS-5 global atmospheric model with an improved surface representation for the GrIS is replayed against the NASA Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) to produce an historical reanalysis. The use of GEOS-5 offers the potential for applying a global model with a realistic GrIS surface representation for the assessment of melt events and their relation to the large-scale climate. These values are compared with output from the Modèle Atmosphérique Régional (MAR) regional climate model and passive microwave remote sensing data. The approach is to spatially average values by drainage basins and evaluate the resulting time series. Seasonally, numerical analyses and models typically indicate less melt coverage during the early summer and more in late summer in comparison to passive microwave data. The relation between melt area, melt duration, and runoff volume differs markedly by drainage basin, with a greater amount of estimated runoff per melt area occurring in southern drainage basins while northern basins are characterized by shorter duration melt periods and a larger percentage of the basin area experiencing melt. An assessment of differences in the spatial and temporal variability of surface melt during enhanced melt years is presented.",

            "abstract": "Pressure solution is an important mass-transfer mechanism driven by dissolution and (re)precipitation creep. It occurs in rocks that contain intergranular fluids and may operate in a wide range of temperature, pressure and rock types. Indicative features for the operation of these processes at microscale were studied in the samples of deformed granites that were sheared in the South Armorican Shear Zone, France. Evidences such as truncate grain and phase boundaries of quartz, K-feldspar and white mica via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and evidence of pressure solution activity was observed in phase boundaries between white mica-quartz and white mica-K-feldspar. In the quartz-white mica phase boundaries we have found evidences for the island-and-channel model of Wassmann and Stöckhert (2013). Quartz dissolution along the phase boundaries is crystallographically controlled. The partial dissolution phase boundary is characterized by very rough surface forming triangular, trapezoidal and asymmetric voids that represent channels for fluid migration in the island-and-channel model, while the undisturbed boundary represents islands. These features are confirmed in the 3D nanotomography. When white mica basal plane is not parallel to the phase boundary, amorphous material and mica overgrowing quartz may occur. In white mica-K-feldspar boundaries, amorphous material representing leached K-feldspar at the K-feldspar interface was observed as previously described by Hellmann et al. (2012). Overall the dissolution reprecipitation seems to be complex mechanism that forms significant features in different phases according to respective crystallographic orientation.",

Gaps in detailed mapping of Quaternary deposits and tectonic landforms did not trigger researches on active faults, but after the tragic event.\nWe present a morphotectonic study of geometry and evolution of the activated fault system (Paganica-San Demetrio, PSDFS). The LIDAR analysis and field survey yield to a new geological and structural map of the area with an unprecedented detail for the Quaternary deposits. It shows an alluvial depositional system prograding and migrating due to fault system evolution.\nThe normal faults offset both the Quaternary deposits and the bedrock. The structural analysis allows us to recognize two fault systems: (A) NNE- and WNW-trending conjugate extensional system overprinting a strike-slip kinematics and (B) dip-slip NW-trending system. Crosscut relationship suggests that the activity of system B prevails, since Early Pleistocene, on system A, which earlier may have controlled a differently shaped basin. System B is the main responsible for the present-day compound outline of the Middle Aterno Valley, while system A major splays now act as segment boundaries.\nThe long-term expression of B results in prominent fault scarps offsetting Quaternary deposits, dissecting erosional and depositional flat landforms. We retrieved detailed morphologic throws along fault scarps and we dated landforms by 14C, OSL (Optically Stimulated Luminescence), CRN (Cosmogenic Radionuclide) and tephra chronology.\nWe show the persistent role of extensional faulting in dominating Quaternary landform evolution and we estimate slip-rate of the PSDFS at different time-scales. The results support repeated activity of PSDFS for ~20 km total length, thus implying M6.6 maximum expected earthquake.\nSuch an approach should have been applied beforehand for the actual hazard estimation, to trigger, early enough, the adoption of precautionary measures against surface faulting events.",

            "abstract": "The 2004 North American Monsoon Experiment (NAME) was an international field campaign conducted over northwestern Mexico, the Gulf of California, and the surrounding region. The overarching goal of NAME was the determination of the sources and limits of predictability of warm season precipitation over North America, with emphasis on time scales ranging from seasonal-to-interannual. The observational component of NAME involved measurements of a range of monsoon phenomena using aircraft, soundings, profilers, research radars, ships, surface stations, rain gauges, and surface flux sites.\nThe NAME enhanced observational network has confirmed a number of previous theories and hypotheses with respect to North American Monsoon (NAM) processes, but also yielded new insight and details regarding specific phenomena of the NAM region. Several new findings stemming from NAME observations are:\nThe 12-14 July 2004 overall gulf surge event was comprised of several stages: an initial disturbance identified as a Kelvin shock (an internal bore modified by rotation) followed by a general acceleration of the flow by multiple convectively generated gravity currents and bores along the span of the Gulf, then ending again in the northern Gulf as a Kelvin shock disturbance;\nA tropical upper-tropospheric trough (TUTT) associated with the 12-14 July Gulf Surged enhanced precipitation on its western flank as it passed over the mountains of northern Mexico. It is found that these upper-level disturbances modify the low-level flow and slightly increase CAPE so as to cause more highly organized mesoscale convective systems to move off the Sierra Madre Occidental toward the west and in doing so, strengthen moisture surges over the Gulf of California; and \nThe diurnal cycle of convection determined from sounding-based heat and moisture budgets over the Sierra Madre Occidental (SMO) is characterized by shallow convection around noon, deep convection at 1800 LT, evolving to stratiform precipitation by midnight. The upslope flow along the western slope of the SMO is delayed until late morning, likely in response to early morning clouds over the SMO and reduced morning insolation over the west-facing slopes.",

Food insecurity is prevalent with significant numbers also affected by flooding during periods of intense rainfall.\nAs part of a multi-partner Adaptation Consortium, Kenya Meteorological Services (KMS) are developing Climate Information Services (CIS) which can better support decision making amongst the counties’ principal livelihoods groups and across County Government ministries. Building on earlier pilots and stakeholder discussion, the system combines the production of climate information tailored for transmission via regional and local radio stations with the establishment of a new SMS service. SMS are provided through a network of CIS intermediaries drawn from across key government ministries, religious networks, non-governmental and community groups, aiming to achieve one SMS recipient per 3-500 people. It also introduces a demand-led, premium-rate SMS weather information service which is designed to be self-financing in the long term. Supporting the ongoing process of devolution, KMS is downscaling national forecasts for each county, and providing seasonal, monthly, weekly and daily forecasts, as well as warnings of weather-related hazards. Through collaboration with relevant ministries, government bodies and research institutions, including livestock, agriculture, drought management and health, technical advisories are developed to provide guidance on application of the climate information. The system seeks to provide timely, relevant information which can enable people to use weather and climate information to support decisions which protect life and property and build resilience to ongoing climate variability and future change.",

We have observed that gamma radiation from airborne constituents varies with weather conditions, especially rainfall events, as observed with ground level instrumentation at near tropical zone low latitudes. Simultaneous observations of natural gamma ray emissions at the ground level and tropical zone rainfall variation observations have been performed in Sao Jose dos Campos, Sao Paulo, Brazil with temporal resolution accuracy of the order of one minute. This has allowed a detailed comparison of rainfall amounts and monitored gamma ray emission time profiles to estimate the actual radionuclide concentration in the rainwater. The radionuclide fallout time profiles were numerically simulated from the observed gamma rate through a numerical minimization procedure. The radionuclide concentration was calculated as a ratio of the simulated fallout to that of the observed rainfall amounts. Our result shows an anti-correlation between the average values of these parameters at times. The effect is especially pronounced at rapid rainfall onsets. The results obtained are compared with the current models and data, and the causes are discussed. Future research will study gamma ray radiation versus weather events at ground level in the temporal zone (North America) where the natural background radiation is thought to be generally somewhat lower than at ground level on the South American continent.",

            "abstract": "Mantle convection is the fundamental process by which the Earth expels its internal heat. It is controlled at the microscopic scale by the motion of crystal defects responsable for plastic deformation at high temperature and pressure conditions of the deep Earth. In this study we focus on dislocations which are usually considered as the most efficient defects contributing to intracrystalline deformation.\nThe influence of temperature is a key parameter in determining the behaviour of dislocations. We propose a model to describe the temperature-dependent mobility of dislocations based on a computational materials science approach, connecting the atomic to the grain scale. This provides elementary knowledge to both interpret seismic anisotropy and to improve geodynamic modelling.\nHere we focus on plastic deformation of the transition zone minerals wadsleyite and ringwoodite, dominating the boundary separating the upper from the lower mantle, a region over which the viscosity is thought to increase rapidly.\nUsing the Peierls-Nabarro-Galerkin model enabled us to select potential glide planes, to predict the dislocation core structures and fundamental properties of both Mg2SiO4 high-pressure polymorphs integrating the non-elastic nature of dislocations from atomic scale based calculations. Macroscopic deformation results from the mobility of these distinct dislocations. High finite mantle temperatures activates unstable double-kink configurations on the dislocation line which allow the dislocation to move under stress. The original contribution of the present work is the formulation of a mobility law for dissociated dislocations as they occur in wadsleyite and ringwoodite. This permits us to predict the critical activation enthalpy required to overcome lattice friction associated to the onset of glide. From this, the effective glide velocities can be derived as a function of stress and temperature leading to the first lower bound estimates of transition zone viscosities.\nThese are the first quantifications that bridge the fundamental properties of defects in the transition zone silicates to constraints on plastic anisotropy and ductile flow in the Earth's deep interior.",

            "abstract": "The climate of the Common Era has yet been studied, albeit with an overall focus on the last millennium. Here we present an analysis for the period 100 BC until 300 AD. The results are based on three simulations with comprehensive climate models, the coupled atmosphere-ocean model ECHO-G (T30) and a recent simulation with the Earth System Model MPI-ESM-P (T63). The ECHO-G simulations are forced (i) only with changes in earth orbital parameters and (ii) additional solar and greenhouse gas forcings, respectively. The MPI-ESM-P simulation additionally includes the effect of volcanic activity.\nIn all simulations summer temperatures show a quite stable temperature level, albeit with a slight negative trend caused by a decline in shortwave insolation due to changes in earth orbit. During the 2nd half of the 3rdcentury AD the MPI-ESM-P simulation shows a decline in temperatures. Since this negative temperature excursion is not evident in the ECHO-G simulations, which does not include volcanic forcing, it seems plausible that a large-size tropical volcanic eruption is responsible for this cooling event. Interestingly, the historical prominent eruption of the Vesuvius in 79 AD is not clear-cut reflected within the European temperature time series, most likely because of the small amount of injections of sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere.\nIn comparison to the only orbitally forced ECHO-G simulation, the additionally solar and GHG forced ECHO-G simulation indicates some externally forced decadal variability connected to solar anomalous periods. Overall, the MPI-ESM-P simulation shows largest decadal variability compared to the ECHO-G simulations, most probably due to the increased horizontal resolution.\nFurther analysis will include a comparison with proxy data with an overall emphasis on hydrological variations. For this task, a number of Regional Climate Model simulations will be used to downscale these global simulations and obtain better insight in the interactions between large and local scales. All these simulations present a great potential for pseudo-proxy and forward modelling experiments, allowing assessments of real-world applications and their limitations towards spatially resolved gridded temperature and hydrological reconstructions.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic land subsidence is a widespread phenomenon threatening several cities in China. One major area of land subsidence is the Beijing city. The city continues to grow and unofficial estimates put the population at around 21-22 million in 2013, with an increase by 40% from 2000 to 2010. Along with the increasing urbanization, demands for water resources become larger. Approximately 2/3 of the water need is supplied by groundwater. To cope with the pressure for water supply, a first “over-sized emergency groundwater resource region (EGRR)” was built in 2003 at the Huairou district, where is the upper and middle plain of the Chaobai River, few tens km to the north of the metropolitan center. Other four EGRRwell-fields have been established in different districts surrounding the city in the next years. The long-time over-exploitation of groundwater resulted in water level fall and land subsidence. Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) on ENVISAT images has been used to detect land subsidence in the northern Beijing plain from 2003 to 2010. The PSI outcome, which was calibrated using ground-based measurements including levelling and extensometers, reveals that the largest subsidence rate reached 52 mm/yr, with a cumulative maximum sinking equal to 342 mm, in the Houshayu city at the southwestern part of the study area where the capital international airport is situated. Land subsidence in the northern zones, where the main well-fields are located, was much smaller in the order of 60 mm. Hydro-geologic investigations have showed that the distribution of groundwater depression cones only partially resembles the land subsidence pattern. The subsidence rates are strongly correlated with the distribution of compressible clay units. In the south-westernmost zone, at the bound of the metropolitan area, the cumulative thickness of cohesive soils amounts to 250 m in the upper 390 m sedimentary sequence. Conversely, sands and gravels prevail in the northern portion of the plain.",

It has been debated whether this recent slowdown is due to natural variability or a missed signal due to gaps in the global observation networks, particularly over the Arctic Region. To examine this more closely, we quantify the impact of data gaps on the global surface temperature trends in several regions of the world (e.g. Polar Regions and the Continents of African and South America), using major global datasets including NOAA’s Merged Land-Ocean Temperature dataset (NOAATemp). We also study the impact of the greater observational coverage in a recently released global temperature data set as part of the International Surface Temperature Initiative (ISTI), and analyze the spatial-temporal variation patterns of the homogenization effect on NOAATemp. A summary of the progress and challenges in filling in grid boxes where observations are sparse over large areas are presented.",

The geothermal production plant is located South of Landau city and the surface deformation affects a large part of the city. Time evolution of the deformation shows that the displacement initiates in the summer 2013 and increases during the whole production time, until March 2014.

            "abstract": "The presence of large water masses influences the thermal regime on the land, with proximity to the ocean or large continental water bodies having a strong effect on local climate. The vast sedimentary plain of the Pampas (Argentina) has extremely low regional slopes and poor surface drainage networks. Under its temperate subhumid climate this region alternates non-flooded periods with flooding cycles of several years that cover up to one third of the landscape with surface water and bring water tables within 1.5 m form the surface in approximately another third. Based on field temperature records for 50 years from 28 sites located 1 to 700 km away from the Atlantic coast and MODIS land surface temperature data, we explore the effects of floods on diurnal and seasonal thermal amplitude and temperature extremes. In non-flooded periods there is a linear increase of mean diurnal thermal amplitude (MDTA) from the coast towards the interior of the region (MDTA raising from 10 to 18 degrees C, 0.97 degrees C/100 km, r2=0.72). During floods the MTDA of flood prone stations declines between 2 to 4 degrees C depending on surface water coverage in the area. At Pehuajo (500 km away from the ocean, most flooded station), MTDA approached typical coastal values during the three flooding cycles recorded in the study period. Frosts-free periods, which are a key driver of the phenology of both natural and cultivated ecosystems, are extended during flooded periods, while heat waves are reduced in frequency and intensity. Temperature records from shallow groundwater (less than 0.5 m of depth) display a substantial diurnal cycle suggesting that waterlogged land complements surface water bodies in its day/night heat transfer role. Reduced thermal amplitude opens an opportunity for longer crop growing periods, including more intense double cropping, which not only contributes to compensates regional production losses caused by floods but opens an opportunity to mitigate them through higher plant transpiration.",

Many weather forecast and climate models use two categories to represent ice cloud particles: cloud ice, and snow. The discrimination between cloud ice and snow is generally not observationally based. Analysis of particle imagery data from high-resolution aircraft particle imaging probes indicates that atmospheric ice particles can easily be differentiated objectively according to their “complexity”: into single crystals and complex aggregates of crystals. In this presentation, we will present results from a survey of aircraft data collected under a variety of different atmospheric conditions. Results show that the particle size where the dominant particle type switches from one type to the other is typically around 150 microns but can vary substantially based on cloud type and temperature.",

            "abstract": "The Nitrogen, Oxidants, Mercury, and Aerosol Distributions, Sources and Sinks (NOMADSS) experiment took place in the summer of 2013. This is one of the first airborne experiments to focus on the sources and chemistry of Hg in the atmosphere. The experiment flew 19 research flights on the NCAR C-130 aircraft, based out of Smyrna, TN. The primary Hg goals for NOMADSS were to constrain emissions of Hg over the U.S. and quantify the distribution and chemistry of Gaseous Elemental Mercury (GEM) and Reactive Mercury (RM) in the troposphere. We measured speciated Hg on the C-130 using the UW-Detector of Oxidized HG species (UW-DOHGS). This instrument has been developed over several years and tested/calibrated with several HgX2 compounds and other compounds to examine possible interferences. In its current configuration, the instrument quantitatively measures HgX2 compounds (HgCl2 and HgBr2) with no interference from O3.\nDuring NOMADSS, flight planning was facilitated by use of the NASA GEOS-5 system, which provided forecasts for many relevant tracers. Post-mission analyses are being conducted using the GEOS-Chem Hg model. This provides a key tool to compare current estimates of Hg sources and distribution with aircraft observations.\nWe are using the NOMADSS data for several types of analyses:\nGEM emissions and concentrations in power plant plumes and downwind of urban centers;\nPresence of RM in relatively high concentration in several free tropospheric locations;\nEvaluation and interpretation of the data using the GEOS-Chem Hg model.\nWhile there are a number of important results from NOMADSS, the most striking is the high concentrations of RM GOM in some regions of the upper troposphere, significantly higher than calculated by the standard GEOS-Chem simulation. We believe this is most likely due to halogen oxidation. These results suggest higher halogen concentrations or faster oxidation of GEM and thus a substantial rethinking of Hg oxidation in the global atmosphere.",

Up to now little is known about the timing and distribution of these late Quaternary sediments originated from far and local transported aeolian dust and sand. They represent valuable archives about environmental change during the late Quaternary. In addition, this fine material is important for growth of the vegetation cover and for water storage and nomadic life. Radiocarbon and luminescence dating provide information concerning their timing to the end of the last glacial cycle and especially to the Holocene, as some of them include loess-paleosol sequences. In addition, valuable information on paleoenvironmental conditions was acquired by grain-size distribution and geochemical analyses (e.g. Nottebaum et al. 2014, Lehmkuhl et. al. 2014).

            "abstract": "A precise description of sediment dynamics (resuspension and re-distribution of sediments) is crucial when investigating the long term evolution of the different morphological entities characterizing tidal landscapes.\nIt has been demonstrated that wind waves are the main responsible for sediment resuspension in shallow micro-tidal lagoons where tidal currents, which produce shear stresses large enough to carry sediments into suspension only within the main channels, are mainly responsible for sediment redistribution.\nA mathematical model has been developed to describe sediment entrainment, transport and deposition due to the combined effect of tidal currents and wind waves in shallow lagoons considering both cohesive and non-cohesive sediments. The model was calibrated and tested using both in situ point observations and turbidity maps obtained analyzing satellite images.\nOnce calibrated the model can integrate the high temporal resolution of point observations with the high spatial resolution of remote sensing, overcoming the intrinsic limitation of these two types of observations.\nThe model was applied to the specific test case of the Venice lagoon simulating an entire year (2005) which was shown to be a “representative” year for wind and tide characteristics. The time evolution of the computed total bottom shear stresses (BSS) and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) was analyzed on the basis of a “Peaks Over Threshold” method once a critical value for shear stress and turbidity were chosen. The analyses of the numerical results enabled us to demonstrate that resuspension events can be modeled as marked Poisson processes: interarrival time, intensity of peak excesses and duration being exponentially distributed random variable.\nThe probability distributions of the interarrival time of overthreshold exceedances in both BSS and SSC as well as their intensity and duration can be used in long-term morphodynamic studies to generate synthetic series statistically equivalent to real sequences through which MonteCarlo realizations of relevant morphological evolutions can be computed.",

            "abstract": "Within aquatic systems, phosphorus (P) is a common limiting nutrient present in low bioavailable concentrations. Colloidal and particulate phases of the trace metals manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) are common scavengers of phosphate in the freshwater environment, and the distribution and stability of such phases is thought to influence the bioavailability of P. The partitioning and flux of P and TM in rivers can be driven by the geochemical source of these constituents, as well as the hydrologic/biogeochemical pathways active within the watershed, both of which vary based on hydrologic condition and landcover. This study investigates how different landcovers (suburban, agricultural, forested, glacial) contribute to P and TM flux and partitioning during high-flow events (snowmelt, glacial melt, storms). High-resolution water and suspended sediment sampling was conducted during snowmelt in Vermont, as well as during summer storms and baseflow conditions. In Alaska, samples were collected during baseflow, glacial melt, and storm events to provide additional data from other landcovers and hydrologic systems. Initial analyses suggest that the size fraction, loading, and relative lability of water and suspended sediment pools of TM and P are strongly influenced by both land cover and seasonality/hydrology. Samples collected during snowmelt in VT show high concentrations of dissolved and potentially bioavailable particulate P at the start of melt that decrease over time. Coupled with high discharge events, a substantial load of labile P is delivered during this particular high flow period. As snowmelt transitions to baseflow conditions, with intermittent storms the character of the suspended sediment changes drastically, with lower total concentrations of P and TM as well as a lower proportion of extractable P (bound to easily reduced oxyhydroxides) to total sediment P. This study highlights that the snowmelt period is not only important from an overall all load standpoint, but may be geochemically unique and provide a particularly reactive flux of dissolved and particulate P and TM. Furthermore, irrespective of high flow event timing or magnitude, landcover dramatically impacts the character and size of P and TM pools, with particularly high concentrations of labile P in agricultural systems.",

            "abstract": "This research investigates the relationship between science communication at a theoretical level and the practice of science communication in long-term ecological research sites (LTERs). In particular, we examine if and how the work of LTER science communication practitioners, individuals with the responsibility to communicate, report, or interpret the findings of his/her LTER with any other group, excluding through K-12 educational programs, aligns with theoretically established models of science communication. Broadly speaking, as over two decades of research in science communication attests, these models tend to emphasize the deficit approach, dialogue with and between audiences, and/or audience participation. Does the practitioners’ work fall neatly into these three “ideal type” categories, or do their practices blur the boundaries of established models? Do practitioners appeal to more than one type of model in the course of their work? Is there evidence of hybrid approaches, or other, new models that have not yet been identified in the literature? Participating organizations will be selected from the Long Term Ecological Research Network, an organization of LTERs funded by the National Science Foundation. The LTER network is actively involved in science communication, as shown by the most recent LTER Strategic Communication Plan. Science communicators may be involved in variety of practices, such as creating translational materials for policymakers to better understand the findings of LTERs, developing training courses for conservation professionals, or organizing site tours for journalists or funders. Practitioners will participate in semi-structured interviews covering how their practices relate to established models of science communication, how they view their roles and responsibilities, and how they view their audience(s). This presentation will cover emerging results from ongoing analysis of interviews conducted with a purposive sample of these individuals. The results will help to expand and refine our understanding of how well theoretical models of science communication describe real-world science communication practices, both at a broad level, and specifically within the LTER context.",

            "abstract": "The development of effective strategies to adapt to changes in the character of droughts and floods in Africa will rely on improved seasonal prediction systems that are robust to an evolving climate baseline and can be integrated into disaster preparedness and response. Many efforts have been made to build models to improve seasonal forecasts in the Greater Horn of Africa region (GHA) using satellite and climate data, but these efforts and models must be improved and translated into future conditions under evolving climate conditions. This has considerable social significance, but is challenged by the nature of climate predictability and the adaptability of coupled natural and human systems facing exposure to climate extremes. To address these issues, work is in progress under a project funded by NASA. The objectives of the project include:\n1) Characterize and explain large-scale drivers in the ocean-atmosphere-land system associated with years of extreme flood or drought in the GHA.\n2) Evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art seasonal forecast methods for prediction of decision-relevant metrics of hydrologic extremes.\n3) Apply seasonal forecast systems to prediction of socially relevant impacts on crops, flood risk, and economic outcomes, and assess the value of these predictions to decision makers.\n4) Evaluate the robustness of seasonal prediction systems to evolving climate conditions.\nThe National Drought Mitigation Center (University of Nebraska-Lincoln, USA) is leading this project in collaboration with the USGS, Johns Hopkins University, University of Wisconsin-Madison, the International Research Institute for Climate and Society, NASA, and GHA local experts. The project is also designed to have active engagement of end users in various sectors, university researchers, and extension agents in GHA through workshops and/or webinars. This project is expected improve and implement new and existing climate- and remote sensing-based agricultural, meteorological, and hydrologic drought and flood monitoring products (or indicators) that can enhance the preparedness for extreme climate events and climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in the GHA. Even though this project is in its first year, the preliminary results and future plans to carry out the objectives will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Steep, mountainous rivers draning recently uplifted lithology on high standing islands within the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone export a disproportionately high amount of sediment given their small area; up to 20% of global export in 3% of the total exorheic land area. Typhoons strongly influence climate in this region, leading to increased sediment discharge, hyperpycnal flow, and efficient deposition of terrestrial particulate organic carbon in marine sediments. If this material escapes benthic remineralization – as is expected due to the lack of a continental shelf – typhoon mediated export of plant-derived POC is a net atmospheric CO2 sink.\nHere we report results from high-resolution (~hours) sampling on the LiWu River, Taiwan, during three sequential typhoons in 2008, and re-examine previous soil samples using more in-depth methods. Using a combination of bulk carbon isotopes (δ13C, ∆14C), vascular plant biomarker concentrations and δ13C, and ramped oxidation radiocarbon analysis, we describe the source and age of exported POC over a range of discharge conditions. We show that previous results indicating an increase in biospheric POC export during typhoons is an oversimplification; pre-aged soil OC complicates export. We offer an updated view of steep, mountainous rivers as a negative feedback loop to increased atmospheric CO2 and estimate for the first time the contribution and residence time of pre-aged soil OC in such a system.",

To use the digital geomorphological analysis 1:50000 scale mapping provided by INEGI and Landsat images, manipulating it in ArcGIS 10.2 developing the DEM that was the basis for morphometric characterization. The results show that the basin is divided into five sub-basins, with the main Atenquique (SAT) and Arroyo Seco (SAS), calculating the compactness coefficient (Kc) and the coefficient of sinuosity indicate that SAT is the most prone to floods due to straight and slightly sinuous channels. However, the density of dissection shows a more developed drainage network on the SAT, with slopes up to 84° and 600 m deep. The drainage basin has its source at an altitude of 4260 m and its mouth is in the Tuxpan River at 1040 m, which has a relative height of 2800 m; has a funnel-shaped elongated west-east, its outstanding average in the sector are Mountain 44° and 10° the piedmont. The SAT has a total area of 81.8 km2, with a dendritic river network, where the first order streams reach an 82.99%, and second order streams are the 13.4% of the total, these values show that most of the slopes of the basin have incipient development valleys and steep slopes. The basin has had 3 debris flows in recent 58 years; these are formed by large volumes of rock and mud that covered the town of Atenquique and paper mill located at the mouth of the Tuxpan River, caused deaths and significant economic damage. Its genesis is associated with the end of the summer rainy season, so he also worked in the hydrological analysis in order to determine the volume of runoff in the basin. The results of this work are used as input for the determining the risk levels in the study area, and may also be used by the municipality of Tuxpan, in order to define policies to manage risk and reduce future risks to the industrial town of Atenquique.",

            "abstract": "This study addresses the following two important science questions: 1) “Have long term trends in landscape change modified the inland patterns of ARs that are responsible for occurrence of storms and flooding in the western US?”, and 2) “What are the relative sensitivities of landscape modifications, particularly in the form of human-induced land-use/land cover (LULC) change, on the synoptic and inland patterns of atmospheric river (AR) events?” The first question was addressed through observational analysis of AR-related storms that occurred from 1970 to 2000. Thirty years (1970-2000) of daily precipitation data from the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) were analyzed to obtain the highest intensity storm event for each decade. For each station and decade, anomalies of precipitable water and integrated vapor transport (IVT) were evaluated as first-hand indicators of the interdecadal synoptic structure and inland propagation of ARs. The results of the study indicated that, large and extensive precipitable water anomaly was observed in the latest decade (the 1990’s) that penetrated deep to the leeward sides of the Cascades and Sierras. The second question was addressed through simulations of the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS, version 6.2) on predefined LULC scenarios that covered portions of western U.S. The established LULC scenarios were intentionally formulated to represent the natural undisturbed landscape and the contemporary landscape as a control. AR duration, AR frequency, IVT-differences and synoptic anomalies have been evaluated in coarser (Grid-1) and finer (Grid-2) grids as essential indicators of the LULC-induced modification in AR hydrometeorology. Our RAMS simulations indicated that the contemporary LULC scenario represented by the control exhibited an increase in the mean AR duration (by over 5hrs) and frequency (by over 10%) as compared to the undisturbed scenario. IVT differences between control and undisturbed scenarios reached up to 200kg m-1 s-1 at the time of maximum precipitation.",

Sensitivity has been shown on synoptic scales with simulated observations to be useful in identifying ensemble subsets that are more likely than the full ensemble mean, which may potentially add value to operational guidance of high-impact events. On convective scales, with highly nonlinear ensemble perturbation evolution and very non-Gaussian distributions of severe weather responses (e.g., simulated reflectivity above some threshold), it becomes more difficult to apply linear-based ensemble sensitivity to improve predictability of severe events. Here we test the ability of ensemble sensitivity to improve predictability of a severe convective event through identifying errors in sensitive regions of different members early in a forecast period using radar and surface-based observations. In this case, through the inspection of a number of operational models, an overnight mesoscale convective system (MCS) and its associated cold pool appeared to strongly influence whether or not severe convection would occur the following afternoon. Since both the overnight MCS and next-day convection are associated with strong nonlinearity and non-Gaussian distributions in the ensemble, this case allows a rigid test of using ensemble sensitivity and related techniques with observations for convective events. The performance of the sensitivity-based technique will be presented, and integration into an operational tool for severe convection will be discussed.",

Past research has associated this summer Arctic Frontal Zone (AFZ) with contrasts in atmospheric heating between the Arctic Ocean and snow-free land, with its regional strength strongly influenced by topography. However, little is known about its variability. We take advantage of output from the latest generation of global atmospheric reanalyses to better constrain and define the spatial and seasonal characteristics of the summer AFZ and evaluate the relative importance of different factors linked to its variability.\nInterannual variations in AFZ strength are primarily dependent on factors affecting temperature over land, especially variability in cloud cover, surface wind direction, and snow cover extent. Local variability in sea ice concentration is also important through its control on temperatures over coastal seas. However, the relative importance of each factor is spatially heterogeneous, and while some factors (like snow cover) are particularly important to early AFZ development in May, other factors (like sea ice concentration) have greater influence on peak AFZ strength in July. Lastly, earlier retreat of both snow cover extent and sea ice concentration each spring and summer has changed the timing of summer AFZ development since 1979, but peak strength has not experienced significant change.",

            "abstract": "Equatorial regions are the scene of prolific generation of gravity waves by deep tropical convection. Waves generated by deep convection have appreciable energy at frequencies and spatial scales that are able to reach altitudes in the Middle Atmosphere and Lower Thermosphere (MLT) and above where they may attain significant amplitudes. A portion of these waves have scales and amplitudes large enough to be detected by space borne instruments. We have analyzed temperature data from the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument on the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics Dynamics (TIMED) satellite for sub-tidal scale fluctuations. Filtering was applied both vertically and horizontally to extract wave variances. We have examined the variances at equatorial latitudes for the altitude region between 70 and 120 km and have have characterized them as a function of season, local time intervals, geographical location and altitude. We find large variances in locations of where convection is particularly prolific (e.g., western South Pacific) and at altitudes where wave trapping is known to be favored (e.g., the lower thermospheric duct). The locations of significant variances persist from year to year. Variances of on the order of a few tens of degrees are found. We have also performed simulations of the response to deep tropical convection with the The Aerospace Corporation Dynamical Model (ADM). This model is a time dependent, high-resolution fully compressible dynamical model that has been used to examine the MLT wave response to intense cellular convection in northern Australia. The background thermal structure for the present simulations was obtained from TIMED/SABER data averaged over low latitudes by season and local time. Our simulations give wave amplitudes that agree reasonably well with the observed amplitudes and show layering that is consistent with the observations. We will show the results of our analysis of TIMED/SABER temperature as a function of geographical location (maps) and altitude (height-latitude cross-sections) for various seasons and local times. We will show simulations for various background thermal states. Our main finding is that in large part significant point to point variations seen in TIMED/SABER temperature data have a wave source.",

            "abstract": "Supraglacial lakes play a significant role in glacial hydrological systems – for example, transporting water to the glacier bed in Greenland or leading to ice shelf fracture and disintegration in Antarctica. To investigate these important processes, multispectral remote sensing provides multiple methods for estimating supraglacial lake depth – either through single-band or band-ratio methods, both empirical and physically-based. Landsat 8 is the newest satellite in the Landsat series. With new bands, higher dynamic range, and higher radiometric resolution, the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard Landsat 8 has a lot of potential.\nThis study uses in situ reflectance spectra and depth measurements to investigate the ability of Landsat 8 to estimate lake depths using multiple methods, as well as quantify improvements over Landsat 7’s ETM+. Similar to other sensors, single-band depth estimates worked well with OLI’s green band (Band 3, 530-590 nm; r = 0.78, RMSE = 0.78 m). The narrower range of OLI’s panchromatic band (Band 8, 500-680 nm) results in good theoretical performance, as well (r = 0.84, RMSE = 0.63 m). Band-ratio methods perform best when taking advantage of OLI’s new “coastal aerosol” band (Band 1, 430-450 nm), paired with either green (r = 0.92, RMSE = 0.38 m) or panchromatic (r = 0.95, RMSE = 0.32 m).\nPromising methods are applied to Landsat 8 OLI imagery of case study areas in Greenland allowing calculation of regional volume estimates using 2013 and 2014 summer-season imagery. Lake depth estimates from band ratio methods are consistent with single-band depth estimates in actual Landsat 8 imagery. Altimetry from NASA’s Operation IceBridge and high resolution WorldView2 DEMs are used to validate lake depth estimates. Optimal methods for supraglacial lake depth estimation with Landsat 8 will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The Aswa Shear zone (ASZ) is a Precambrian lithospheric structure which forms the western margin of the East African Orogeny (EAO) that influenced the evolution of many tectonic events in Eastern Africa including the East African Rift System. It separates the cratonic entities of Saharan Metacraton in the northeast from the Congo craton and the Tanzanian craton and the Kibaran orogenic belt to the southwest. However little is known about its kinematics and the extent and tectonic origin are not fully understood. We developed a new technique based on the tilt method to extract kinematic information from high-resolution airborne magnetic data. We also used radiometric data over Uganda integrated with Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in South Sudan to understand the extent, kinematics and define the tectonic origin of ASZ. (1) Our results suggest that the ASZ extends in a NW-SE for ~550 km in Uganda and South Sudan. (2) The airborne magnetic and radiometric data revealed a much wider (~50 km) deformation belt than the mapped 5-10 km of exposed surface expression of the ASZ. The deformation belt associated with the shear is defined by three NW-trending sinistral strike-slip shear zones bounding structural domains with magnetic fabrics showing splays of secondary shear zones and shear-related folds. These folds are tighter close to the discrete shear zones with their axial traces becoming sub-parallel to the shear zones. Similar fold patterns are observed from South Sudan in the SRTM DEM. We interpret these folds as due to ENE-WSW shortening associated with the sinistral strike-slip movement. (3) To the northeast of the shear zone, the magnetic patterns suggest a series of W-verging nappes indicative of strong E-W oriented shortening. Based on the above observations, we relate the evolution of the ASZ to Neoproterozoic E-W collision between East and West Gondwana. This collision produced E-W contraction resulting in W-verging thrusts to the east and a sinistral strike-slip movement along the NW-trending ASZ with strain localization at the boundary between the Saharan Metacraton and the Tanzania craton. This evidence suggests that 1) ASZ lies at the boundary between Sahara Metacraton and Tanzania Craton 2) ASZ is not a product of escape tectonics as previously suggested.",

            "abstract": "The 4He/40Ar* ratio (where 40Ar* is 40Ar corrected for atmospheric contamination) is known to be sensitive to magmatic degassing due to the different solubilities of He and Ar in silicate melts: 4He/40Ar* increases in the residual liquids because Ar is less soluble than He and therefore degasses more rapidly. Conversely, lithophile isotope ratios and incompatible trace element ratios (87Sr/86Sr, 143Nd/144Nd, La/Sm etc) are specifically chosen as these are largely insensitive to magmatic processes, including degassing (as far as mid-ocean ridges are concerned) but rather trace mantle heterogeneities. It is astonishing therefore that correlations between 4He/40Ar* and lithophile isotope ratios (such as 87Sr/86Sr or 143Nd/144Nd) exist in South East Indian Ridge basalts and basaltic glasses [1]. These correlations appear to be the result of enhanced degassing of magmas produced from enriched mantle: enriched mantle probably has higher C contents relative to depleted mantle, therefore degassing of ‘enriched’ compositions will start at higher pressure and the proportion of volatiles lost will be greater than for ‘depleted’ lavas. The 4He/40Ar* ratio of the erupted products depends on the proportion of volatiles lost, therefore 4He/40Ar* is higher in lavas derived from enriched as opposed to depleted magmas. Naturally, enriched lavas are also distinct from depleted lavas in their lithophile isotopic composition (high 87Sr/86Sr, low 143Nd/144Nd) and thus the observed correlations between lithophile isotopes and degassing (4He/40Ar*) is created.\n A simple degassing model suggests that, in order to generate the correlated variability in Sr and Nd isotopes and 4He/40Ar*, the mantle C concentration likely varies by factor ~2 [1]. Thus it is possible to link mantle C variability – which is difficult to asses due to shallow level degassing – with Sr isotopic composition, which is very commonly measured in mid-ocean ridge basalts: Sr isotopes can be used as a proxy for mantle C concentration variation if the entire mantle Sr isotope variation is due to recycling of material with a near-constant Sr/C ratio. The validity of Sr isotopes as a mantle C heterogeneity proxy will be assessed using the PetDB database.\n ",

            "abstract": "Full waveform seismic modeling requires a huge amount of computing power that still challenges today’s technology. This limits the applicability of powerful processing approaches in seismic exploration like full-waveform inversion. This paper explores the use of Graphics Processing Units (GPU) to compute a time based finite-difference solution to the viscoelastic wave equation. The aim is to investigate whether the adoption of the GPU technology is susceptible to reduce significantly the computing time of simulations.\nThe code presented herein is based on the freely accessible software of Bohlen (2002) in 2D provided under a General Public License (GNU) licence. This implementation is based on a second order centred differences scheme to approximate time differences and staggered grid schemes with centred difference of order 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 for spatial derivatives. The code is fully parallel and is written using the Message Passing Interface (MPI), and it thus supports simulations of vast seismic models on a cluster of CPUs.\nTo port the code from Bohlen (2002) on GPUs, the OpenCl framework was chosen for its ability to work on both CPUs and GPUs and its adoption by most of GPU manufacturers. In our implementation, OpenCL works in conjunction with MPI, which allows computations on a cluster of GPU for large-scale model simulations.\nWe tested our code for model sizes between 1002 and 60002  elements. Comparison shows a decrease in computation time of more than two orders of magnitude between the GPU implementation run on a AMD Radeon HD 7950 and the CPU implementation run on a 2.26 GHz Intel Xeon Quad-Core. The speed-up varies depending on the order of the finite difference approximation and generally increases for higher orders. Increasing speed-ups are also obtained for increasing model size, which can be explained by kernel overheads and delays introduced by memory transfers to and from the GPU through the PCI-E bus. Those tests indicate that the GPU memory size and the slow memory transfers are the limiting factors of our GPU implementation.\nThose results show the benefits of using GPUs instead of CPUs for time based finite-difference seismic simulations. The reductions in computation time and in hardware costs are significant and open the door for new approaches in seismic inversion.",

It was intruded into mid-crustal level (~700 MPa), high-grade rocks during Taconian assembly of the Helgeland Nappe Complex. Stage 1 of the pluton is massive pyroxene hornblende gabbro with poikilitic hornblende. Stage 2, the subject of this study, occupies the central and western parts of the pluton and is gradationally zoned from central, layered, xenolith-rich hornblende biotite two-pyroxene diorite + anorthosite, to western, massive, xenolith-poor hornblende biotite three-pyroxene quartz monzonite. Bulk-rock compositions are consistent with widespread accumulation of pyroxene + plagioclase.\nIn order to separate effects of accumulation from assimilation, trace element zoning profiles in augite were used as a proxy for changes in melt composition. Augite is normally zoned, with incompatible elements increasing from cores to rims. However, trace element variation among samples plots as multiple trends that can be resolved into two broad groups that correspond to the central and western zones. Augite in the layered central zone has lower abundances of REE, Pb and Hf and higher abundances of Cr, V, Ni, Sr, and P compared to the western zone. The two trends intersect at low concentrations of incompatible elements such as Zr.\nCalculation of melts in equilibrium with augite, combined with AFC-type modeling, suggest that variation in augite Zr contents requires assimilation of Zr-rich rocks in all Stage 2 rocks. In the western zone, increases in Zr, Hf, REE and Pb suggest assimilation of Neoproterozoic gneisses that are host to the western zone; this conclusion is consistent with bulk-rock δ18O values.\nWe conclude that assimilation of host rocks was widespread in this mid-crustal magma body, and that augite preserves a trace element record of differentiation (AFC) that is difficult to identify using bulk-rock compositions alone.",

            "abstract": "Although many small bodies apparently generated dynamo fields in the early solar system, the nature and temporal evolution of these fields has remained enigmatic. Time-resolved records of the Earth's planetary field have been essential in understanding the dynamic history of our planet, and equivalent information from asteroids could provide a unique insight into the development of the solar system. Here we present time-resolved records of magnetic activity on the main-group pallasite parent body and (16) Psyche, obtained using newly-developed nanomagnetic imaging techniques. For the pallasite parent body, the inferred field direction remained relatively constant and the intensity was initially stable at ~100 µT before it decreased in two discrete steps down to 0 µT. We interpret this behaviour as due to vigorous dynamo activity driven by compositional convection in the core, ultimately transitioning from a dipolar to multipolar field as the inner core grew from the bottom-up. For Psyche (measured from IVA iron meteorites), the inferred field direction reversed, while the intensity remained stable at >50 µT. Psyche cooled rapidly as an unmantled core, although the resulting thermal convection alone cannot explain these observations. Instead, this behaviour required top-down core solidification, and is attributed either to compositional convection (if the core also solidified from the bottom-up) or convection generated directly by top-down solidification (e.g. Fe-snow). The mechanism governing convection in small body cores is an open question (due partly to uncertainties in the direction of core solidification), and these observations suggest that unconventional (i.e. not thermal) mechanisms acted in the early solar system. These mechanisms are very efficient at generating convection, implying a long-lasting and widespread epoch of dynamo activity among small bodies in the early solar system.",

            "abstract": "The importance of freshwater discharge from glaciers and ice sheets along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is now evident, but quantifying the source of freshwater inputs (e.g., calving, ice sheet basal melt, and/or subglacial flow) directly and the associated constituent fluxes have been limited. The mode of freshwater contribution in glacier marine environments can be important to understanding glacial melt dynamics related to climate change and overall influences on the coastal ecosystem. As part of an NSF funded project, we are attempting to quantify for the first time using land-based measurements the rate of freshwater input and the associated flux of nutrients and iron to the coastal waters of the WAP, and the mixing of these constituents across the continental shelf. This research is combining geophysical measurements with established radio- (radium quartet and 222Rn) and stable tracer (18O and 2H) techniques to quantify submarine groundwater discharge (SGD), particularly the freshwater contributions, to the coast and delineate the source of water and dissolved constituents.\nNearshore surface water and end member (e.g., streams, groundwater, etc.) tracer data suggest a means of discerning the source of freshwater, with up to 50% of freshwater input from subsurface flow. Time series tracer data in combination with electrical resistivity measurements provide clear observations of SGD and provide insights into tidal influences and the rapid response of subsurface fluid interactions. More broadly, 223Ra and 224Ra activities are elevated in porewaters and glacial meltwaters and decreased in surface water with distance from shore. A preliminary mass balance model estimates SGD at approximately 200 m3 d-1 per m of shoreline during austral summer, comparable to temperate environments.\nAcross the shelf, surface water tracer concentrations suggest rapid cross-shelf mixing (730-14000 m2s-1) that could increase delivery of nearshore freshwater and dissolved constituents further afield. Primary production in iron-limited waters offshore of the WAP is believed to be fueled by continentally-derived sediments. Based on these measurements, SGD could potentially be an important and unaccounted source of iron to continental shelf waters.",

            "abstract": "Rock fractures are a source of extra compliance, and the effect of fractures on seismic wave propagation can be quantified in terms of the normal and shear fracture compliances. However, fractures are usually assumed to be smooth discontinuities with no preferential orientation for slippage. This assumption rarely matches with outcrop studies. Irregularities always exist on the fracture faces in the form of hackles, slickensides, or gouges. These features may facilitate movement in one direction while oppose shear deformation in the other direction due to the saw-tooth structure of irregularities. This direction dependence of the shear compliance of the fracture planes may affect the measured ratio of normal to shear fracture compliance for different locations along the fracture. Furthermore, these effects may contribute to the pressure dependence of fracture compliance, because fracture opening or shear sliding would change the number of asperities in contact and, consequently, affect the ratio of the normal to shear compliance. Here, we use numerical modeling to investigate the change in normal and shear compliance caused by the presence of slickensides. The effect of the hackles’ geometry, the friction coefficient between the fracture surfaces, and the offset between the fracture faces will be discussed in this presentation. Our analysis shows that even in the case of low asperity angles or small offsets between the fracture faces, the fracture compliance ratio could be greater than one, in agreement with several field observations available in the literature.",

            "abstract": "As renewable energy system become more prevalent, improved global long-term, up-to-date records are needed to better understand and quantify the solar resource and variability. Toward this end, a project involving NASA, DOE NREL, SUNY-Albany and the NOAA National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) was initiated to provide NREL with a solar resource mapping production system for improved depiction of global long-term solar resources that provides the capacity for continual updates. This new production system is made possible by the efforts of NOAA and NASA to completely reprocess the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) data set that provides satellite visible and infrared radiances together with retrieved cloud and surface properties on a 3-hourly basis beginning from July 1983 at an effective 10 km resolution. Thus, working with SUNY and NCDC, NASA will develop and test an improved production system that will yield an operational production system for NREL to continually update the Earth’s solar resource. In this presentation, we provide a general overview of this project together with samples of the new solar irradiance mapped data products and comparisons to surface measurements at various locations across the world. Here, a three-year prototype of the anticipated ISCCP data set called GridSat is used to assess the algorithms and demonstrate the production system. GridSat maps together cross-calibrated visible and IR reflectances from all the world’s geosynchronous satellites at 10 km and 3-hourly respectively. The results are shown and discussed in comparison to existing solar data products. Additionally, the solar irradiance values are compared to various Baseline Surface Radiation Network surface site measurements and other high quality surface measurements. The statistics of the agreement between the measurements and new satellite estimates are also reviewed. The team is now testing a beta release of the revised ISCCP data set through the NOAA NCDC. This data set also includes the cross-calibrated AVHRR polar orbiter imager measurements that will allow a true global coverage.  Lastly, we will identify the next steps in the production of the data set including some accuracy goals as the current production system is adapted to the new ISCCP data products.",

            "abstract": "We use xenoliths from young (3 Ma to present) cinder cones in the tectonically active Mojave desert region of southern California to characterize the rheological properties of the lower crust and upper mantle. The xenoliths were collected from two localities ~90 km apart: the Cima and Dish Hill volcanic fields. The xenolith suites represent a depth range of ~25-60 km and include spinel and plagioclase facies peridotites and lower crustal gabbros. We document how stress, temperature, water content, deformation mechanism, lattice preferred orientation, and style of localization vary with increasing depth in both xenolith suites.\nKey findings thus far include the following:\n(1) Both xenolith suites exhibit a wide range of deformation textures, ranging from granular, to protogranular, to porphyroclastic and mylonitic. The higher strain fabrics show no evidence for static annealing, thus are likely reflecting youthful deformation and strain gradients at depth.\n(2) Both xenolith suites show abundant dynamic recrystallization and other evidence for dislocation creep as the dominant deformation mechanism. This is consistent with recent models of upper mantle post-seismic relaxation following the Landers and Hector Mine earthquakes, which require a component of power-law creep in order to fit the post-seismic surface response.\n(3) A- and E-type olivine LPOs occur in both xenolith suites. Further work will determine whether these fabrics are related to changes in water content as inferred from experimental studies.\n(4) Deformation in most lower crustal gabbros is weak, but some show strong fabrics associated with plagioclase-rich zones.\n(5) Measurements of olivine subgrain sizes in Dish Hill samples are similar to previously published measurements from Cima, suggesting similar stress magnitudes at depth in both locations. Paleopiezometers for olivine and plagioclase indicate stress magnitudes of 11-20 MPa for the uppermost mantle, and 0.1 MPa for the lowermost crust.",

            "abstract": "We present the first observations of Mercury's plasma mantle, a major source for solar wind entry into the planet's magnetosphere. The plasma mantle is created when reconnected magnetic flux tubes at the dayside magnetopause convect anti-sunward with the magnetosheath flow. As these flux tubes are assimilated into the lobes they carry solar wind plasma into the magnetotail. MESSENGER Fast Imaging Plasma Spectrometer (FIPS) and Magnetometer observations have been analyzed for two orbits when the FIPS field of view was well oriented to measure the field-aligned plasma flowing just inside the high-latitude tail magnetopause. For both events, frequent flux transfer events are observed in the magnetosheath, cusp, and nightside magnetopause, indicating that magnetic flux was being added to the magnetotail during these two intervals. The main plasma mantle features at Mercury are similar to those found at Earth: (1) a decrease in plasma density as MESSENGER moves from the magnetopause deeper into the tail lobes; and (2) a clear dispersion in the proton energy distribution, indicating that low-energy protons are being transported equatorward and much deeper into the magnetotail than the higher energy particles that escape by streaming tailward along the lobe field lines before they can E×B drift to the plasma sheet, where E and B are the electric and magnetic fields, respectively. The three-dimensional FIPS plasma distributions confirm that the solar wind protons entering the magnetosphere are indeed flowing anti-sunward with weighted average energies of 0.27 and 0.28 keV, corresponding to a velocity of ~230 km s-1. Diamagnetic depressions, indicating the presence of plasma, are observed in the magnetic field data, and the total field magnitude increases throughout the plasma mantle as the plasma disperses. The proton energy dispersion implies a cross-magnetosphere electric potential of ~20–30 kV, which supports the estimates made from the measurement of dayside magnetopause structure.",

            "abstract": "A newly discovered and highly active seepage area has been acoustically mapped at the western edge of the Aquitaine Shelf in the Bay of Biscay [\nDupré et al., 2014\n].\nThree selected seeping sites have been investigated with a Remotely Operated Vehicle. All sites were characterized by vigorous gas emissions, and the occurrence of massive carbonate crusts and bacterial mats at the seafloor. Nine seeps have been sampled with the PEGAZ sampler. The latter allowed gas-bubble sampling and preservation at in situpressure, together with gas-flux measurement through its graduated transparent cone.\nThe C2+ fraction of the gas samples accounts for less than 0.06 %-mol of the total composition. Both the abundance of methane and dD and d13C isotopic analyses of the hydrocarbons indicate a biogenic source generated by microbial reduction of carbon dioxide [Whiticar et al., 1986]. The analyses of the associated noble gases also provide further support for a shallow-depth generation. While sharing the same origin, the collected samples are different in other respects, such as the measured d13C values for carbon dioxide and the hydrocarbons. This is the case in particular for methane, with displays values in between -66.1 and -72.7 ‰. We hypothesized that such variations are the result of multiple gas-transport processes along with the occurrence of hydrocarbon oxidation at different rates within the sedimentary column. The measured gas fluxes are extremely heterogeneous from one seep to another, ranging from 18 to 193 m3.yr-1. These values will be discussed in detail by comparing them with values obtained from different measurement techniques at other gas-seeping sites.\nThe GAZCOGNE study is co-funded by TOTAL and IFREMER as part of the PAMELA (Passive Margin Exploration Laboratories) scientific project.\n",

            "abstract": "Microseismic mapping is a passive seismic technique used extensively for assessment of hydraulic fracturing treatments during the last two decades. Basically, microseisms are microearthquakes induced by the changes in stress and pore-fluid pressure associated with the hydraulic fracturing treatment. Current practice to locate events and determine the source mechanism of microseismic events associated with hydraulic fracture treatments only includes far-field terms for the moment tensor inversion. The intermediate-field terms and near-field term are normally ignored, perhaps simply following the tradition in locating distant earthquakes. However, source-receiver distances in hydraulic fracturing are usually 1000 ft (~300m), which is much less than the typical distances in earthquakes; therefore the effect of near and intermediate-field effects are not yet known.\nWe try to include these near-field effects to improve the precision of locating the events and consequently determining the source mechanism. We find that the intermediate-field term may contribute up to 1/3 of the signal amplitude when the source-receiver distance is about 300 m. The intermediate-field term contributes ~1/20 of the signal amplitude when the source-receiver distance is ~ 2000 m . When the source-receiver distance exceeds ~ 2000 m, the intermediate-field terms can be ignored in our inversion. In our case, we also confirm that the near-field term can be ignored in microseismic analysis. Our results indicate that the intermediate-field terms can improve moment tensor inversion between 2% to 40% at source-receiver ranges less than 300 m. However for the case of large distances, the improvement using this technique is limited to 1%. In the presence of strong environmental noise, intermediate-field terms help to effectively improve the moment tensor inversion: i.e., 15% improvement with noise present vs 3% improvement without noise.",

Environmental processes play a vital role in the trigger of WNV. Here, using logistical regression models, we quantified relationships between hydroclimatic processes and mosquito abundance for WNV across the continental USA using precipitation and temperature at different spatial and temporal scales. It will be shown that reported cases of this disease are more prevalent during spring and summer months in the entire country, when there is more precipitation and higher surface air temperatures for 2003 to 2013.

            "abstract": "During recent decades, Northern Eurasia was affected by unprecedented climate and environmental changes. Several droughts and heat waves alternated with hazardous extreme precipitation and flood events. Permafrost thaw, retreating Arctic sea ice, increasing areas of forest fire, and dramatic regional warming buffeted this region, tossing northern Eurasia from one extreme condition to the next. The region stores nearly half of the Earth’s terrestrial carbon in permafrost, wetlands, and forested land, so ecosystem changes that release stored carbon could profoundly affect the world’s climate. Furthermore, changes to climate and to hydrological and biogeochemical cycles are starting to affect daily life. For example, infrastructure is collapsing as permafrost thaws, severe winter storms increasingly bring businesses to a halt, and a growing water deficit is beginning to strain agricultural production and forestry. To pool resources and facilitate research, the Northern Eurasia Earth Science Partnership Initiative (NEESPI,\nhttp://neespi.org\n) was launched in 2004. With its multidisciplinary focus, the internationally funded NEESPI (more than165 individual international projects during the past decade) has challenged participants to research climate-ecosystem interactions, societal impacts from extreme events in Northern Eurasia, and the feedbacks of these interactions and impacts to the global Earth system. Among the numerous Institutional and private sponsors from the United States, European Union, Russia, China, and Japan, the cornerstone support for the NEESPI studies was provided by the NASA Land Cover and Land Use Change Program and the Russian Academy of Sciences.\nAt this presentation we shall overview the environmental studies conducted by the NEESPI community, brief the audience about the main achievements of the NEESPI researchers, and lay down the plans for the future studies. At the side event of the Meeting, we are going to initiate preparation of the book which will synthesize major NEESPI achievements.",

            "abstract": "Reclaimed soils are typically characterized by increased bulk densities, penetration resistances and poor soil structure as well as associated problems with hydrology and aeration. As a result, available rooting space for planted tree seedlings is often restricted to a shallow layer of topsoil, which is usually of higher quality and is cultivated prior to planting. This may hinder the development of healthy root systems, thus drastically increasing the risk for plant stress by limiting access to soil resources such as water, nutrients and oxygen. These problems are exacerbated when herbaceous plants compete for the same resources within this limited root-zone.\nTo understand how limited rooting space affects the physiology of young trees, we experimentally manipulated soil conditions and levels of competition at a reclaimed mine site in central Alberta, Canada. The site was characterized by heavily compacted, fine textured subsoil (~2.0 Mg ha-1), capped with 15 cm of topsoil (~1.5 Mg ha-1). In a replicated study (n=6) half the plots were treated with a subsoil plow to a depth of about 60 cm to increase available rooting spece. Subsequently, trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and smooth brome (Bromus inermis L.) were planted to create four vegetation covers: aspen (a), brome (b), aspen + brome (ab) and control (c) (no vegetation). Various soil properties, including texture, bulk density, penetration resistance and water availability, in conjunction with plant parameters such as root and shoot growth, leaf area development, sap flow, and stomatal conductance have since been monitored, both in-situ and through destructive sampling.\nOur results indicate that the soil treatment was effective in lowering bulk densities and penetration resistance, while improving moisture retention characteristics. Tree seedling growth and leaf area development were significantly greater without competition, but did not differ between soil treatments. The soil treatment generally promoted more roots at greater depth, but differences between treatments were as yet marginal. Tree water use increased as a consequence of the soil treatment and was highest when competition was removed too. Interestingly sap flow per unit leaf area was always greater for trees faced with herbaceous competition.",

MarsFest is a planetary analog festival that has been held annually in Death Valley National Park since 2012, made possible with support from the Curiosity (primarily the Sample Analysis at Mars) Education and Public Outreach team, NASA’s Ames Research Center, NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, the SETI Institute, and Death Valley National Park. Both the Lunar Workshops for Educators and MarsFest rely strongly on scientist engagement for their success. In the Lunar Workshops, scientists and engineers give talks for workshop participants, support facility tours and field trips, and, where possible, have lunch with the teachers to interact with them in a less formal setting. Teachers have enthusiastically appreciated and benefited from all of these interactions, and the scientists and engineers also provide positive feedback about their involvement. In MarsFest, scientists and engineers give public presentations and take park visitors on field trips to planetary analog sites. The trips are led by scientists who do research at the field trip sites whenever possible. Surveys of festival participants indicate an appreciation for learning about scientific research being conducted in the park from the people involved in that research, and scientists and engineers report enjoying sharing their work with the public through this program. The key to effective scientist engagement in all of the workshops and festivals has been a close relationship and open communication between the scientists and engineers and the activity facilitators. I will provide more details about both of these programs, how scientists and engineers are involved in them, and offer suggestions for others who would like to engage scientists and engineers in similar activities.",

            "abstract": "Mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet increased significantly over the last several decades and current mass losses of 260-380 Gt ice/yr contribute 0.7-1.1 mm/yr to global sea-level rise. Greenland mass loss includes ice discharge via marine-terminating outlet glaciers and surface meltwater runoff, the former now making up a third to a half of total ice loss. The magnitude of ice discharge depends in part on ice-flow speed, which has broadly increased since 2000 but varies locally, regionally, and from year to year. Research on a limited set of Greenland glaciers also shows that speeds vary seasonally. However, for much of the west, northwest, and southeast coasts where ice loss is increasing most rapidly, there are few or no records of seasonal velocity variation. Ice velocity is influenced by several key components of the ice-sheet-ocean-climate system: subglacial environment, surface melt and runoff, and ice-ocean interaction at the ice-front (terminus). Thus, knowledge of seasonal velocity patterns is important for predicting annual ice discharge, understanding the effects of increased surface melt on total mass loss, and establishing how ice-flow responds to other climatic changes. We developed 5-year records of seasonal velocity measurements for 55 glaciers around the ice-sheet margin. Among glaciers with significant speed variations, we find three distinct seasonal velocity patterns. One pattern indicates relatively high glacier sensitivity to ice-front position, with seasonal summer speedup sustained through fall. The other two patterns appear to be meltwater controlled and indicate regional differences in which some subglacial systems likely transition seasonally from inefficient, distributed hydrologic networks to efficient, channelized drainage, while others do not. These differences in dominant velocity control mechanisms reveal likely spatiotemporal variations in the dynamic response of the ice sheet to climate change.",

            "abstract": "Remote sensing and satellite data have enormously progressed in the last decade and became a potential data source to better model land and water resources spatially and temporally. When several global satellite evaporation datasets are compared over the upper Blue Nile (UBN) basin in Ethiopia, it was found that they do not agree temporally nor spatially. All the datasets underestimate evaporation and thus closure of the water budget is not achievable with errors in the order of 30% of the mean annual precipitation. This study presents a method that combines readily available global satellite and river flow measurements to estimate actual and potential evapotranspiration in the UBN basin. The method used is a model that assimilates satellite measurements of TRMM precipitation, WM potential evapotranspiration, GRACE terrestrial water content and flow gauge stations’ measurements into a one-layer soil water balance model. The model is constrained with mass conservation law, topographic setting and its impact on flow routing and soil water holding capacity. The constrained model produces physically consistent long-term spatial and temporal distributions of the hydrological cycle components over the UBN basin. The basin is then divided into smaller sub-basins to investigate evapotranspiration trends. The method described here is applicable to other data-sparse basins facing future challenges of water scarcity and climate change.",

            "abstract": "The next generation GOES spacecraft will continue the long-term operational measurement of the charged particle environment in geosynchronous orbit with the SEISS space environment monitors. The suite comprises five instruments that measure electrons and ions in multiple energy ranges and a data processing unit. Two of the instruments, MPS-LO and EHIS provide new measurement capabilities compared with previous GOES environmental monitors. The MPS-LO (new to GOES) is an electrostatic instrument that measures electrons and ions from 30 eV to 30 keV in 15 logarithmically spaced energy bins. Its twelve 15ox5o angular channels provide a 180o FOV oriented north to south. The MPS-HI instrument, using solid state Si detector telescopes, covers the energy range of 50 keV to 4 MeV for electrons and 80 keV to 10 MeV for protons each along five 15o half angle look angles spaced 35o apart. High energy solar and galactic protons in the range of 1 to 500 MeV are measured by the SGPS, which also has an integral channel above 500 MeV. This broad energy range is divided into three sub-ranges, 1-25, 25-80 and 80-500 MeV, each measured by a separate Si detector telescope. The opening half-angles of the telescopes are 30o, 30o and 45o respectively. There are east and west oriented SGPS instruments. Energetic heavy ions are detected by EHIS, also consisting of solid state detectors, in thirty individual species from H to Ni and in five logarithmically spaced energy bands from 10 MeV/n to 200 MeV/n. The FOV is a 30oopening half-angle cone. Extensive calibrations at accelerator facilities have been performed to verify the 25% accuracy of each instrument’s geometric factor. In addition, performances of the solid state detector instruments have been modeled using the GEANT and FLUKA Monte Carlo codes and the results compared to calibration measurements. Energy overlap regions of the instruments will be used to improve the quality and self-consistency of the data sets.",

            "abstract": "The electronic states of Fe in silicates are key to the chemistry, physical properties and dynamics of Earth’s mantle. In the lower mantle’s dominant phase, perovskite-structured (Mg,Fe)SiO3, recently named bridgmanite, and its deep lower mantle polymorph, post-perovskite, Fe can occupy either cation site and multiple valence and spin states. In addition, studies of Fe2+-bearing starting materials at lower mantle conditions have observed oxidation to Fe3+ in the synthesized silicate, either by a disproportionation, Fe2+ = Fe3+ + Fe metal, or possibly reduction of the high-pressure cell. The incorporation of Al in lower mantle silicates has been observed to promote higher Fe3+/ΣFe. Due to this complexity, electronic states of Fe in lower mantle silicates are controversial. We used energy-domain synchrotron Mössbauer spectroscopy at ESRF beamline ID18 to examine spin and valence states of bridgmanite and post-perovskite synthesized from Fe2+-rich compositions with and without Al. 57Fe-enriched starting materials (Mg0.5Fe0.5)SiO3 pyroxene and Fe2.8Al2.2Si3.0O12 almandine-composition glass were pressurized in an NaCl medium in the laser-heated diamond anvil cell to up to 170 GPa. Bridgmanite was synthesized at 75-99 GPa and 2000-2500 K. Post-perovskite was synthesized at 149-160 GPa and 2500-3000 K. The observed quadrupole splitting (QS) and center shift (CS) are consistent with dominant Fe2+ for all compositions and do not show higher Fe3+/ΣFe with higher Al-content. The dominant doublet at lower mantle pressures exhibits QS=3.6-4.2 mm/s and CS=0.9-1.1 mm/s, similar to previous observations of high or intermediate spin Fe2+. A second high-spin Fe2+ doublet is observed at QS=2.2-3.3 mm/s and CS=0.8-1.2 mm/s. A minor high-spin Fe3+ doublet is fit to QS~1.2 mm/s and CS=0.3-0.5 mm/s. For the Al-bearing bridgmanite, ambient spectra before and after synthesis contain no more than ~10% Fe3+/ΣFe, indicating no disproportionation or oxidation of Fe2+. In contrast, previous studies of Al-bearing bridgmanite observed ~50% Fe3+/ΣFe. This difference may reflect the high Si-content of the starting material and balance of Al between the Si-site and Mg-site. The effects of Al on oxidation potential of Fe in bridgmanite and the lower mantle oxygen fugacity must also be assessed as a function of Si-content and Si/Al ratio.",

            "abstract": "The rational management of oil and gas reservoirs requires understanding of their response to existing and planned schemes of exploitation and operation. Such understanding requires analyzing and quantifying the influence of the subsurface uncertainty on predictions of oil and gas production. As the subsurface properties are typically heterogeneous causing a large number of model parameters, the dimension independent Monte Carlo (MC) method is usually used for uncertainty quantification (UQ). However, the standard MC simulation is computationally expensive because a large number of model executions are required and each model execution is costly simulated on a fine scale spatial grid to ensure accuracy. This study describes a multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method for UQ in reservoir simulation. MLMC is a variance reduction technique for the standard MC. It improves computational efficiency by conducting simulations on a geometric sequence of grids, a larger number of simulations on coarse grids and fewer simulations on fine grids. In this study, we applied the MLMC method to a highly heterogeneous reservoir model from the tenth SPE project. We estimated both the expectation and the probability distribution of oil productions to quantify the influence of subsurface uncertainty. The results indicate that MLMC can achieve the same accuracy as standard MC with a significantly reduced cost, e.g., about 80-90% and 70-90% computational savings in estimating expectations and approximating probability distributions, respectively.",

We applied a spatially explicit, three-dimensional model to simulate surface and subsurface flow and exchange, temperature, and dissolved oxygen within the 15 sq km Nyack Floodplain of the Middle Fork Flathead River, Montana, USA. We ran the model for four years and simulated nine conservative particle releases across a range of river discharges. Our model results include simulations that: 1) describe the rapid hydrologic response of the alluvial aquifer to flood events, 2) quantify a substantial effect of surface-subsurface water exchange on the hydrologic residence time of the floodplain, and 3) explain >75% of variance in aquifer temperature and >65% of variance in dissolved oxygen concentrations across space and through time (laterally, vertically, and during seasonal discharge variation). We also explore the relationship between simulated residence time and the spatial distribution of electron donors (dissolved organic carbon concentration and quality) and acceptors (nitrate, iron, sulfate) throughout the aquifer. Our results underscore the importance of geomorphic, hydrologic, and temperature dynamics in driving river ecosystem processes, and they demonstrate how a sufficient representation of the physical template of a river ecosystem can be used to explain complex spatiotemporal patterns of biogeochemical dynamics.",

The satellite data records have disparate qualities, structure and uncertainty which make comparing weather from the 80s and 2000s a challenging prospect. Likewise, in-situ data records lack complete coverage of the earth in both space and time. Atmospheric reanalyses use the observations with numerical models and data assimilation to produce continuous and consistent weather data records for periods longer than decades. The result is a simplified data format with a relatively straightforward learning curve that includes many more variables available (through the modeling component of the system), but driven by a full suite of observational data.\nThe simplified data format allows introduction into weather and climate data analysis. Some examples are provided from undergraduate meteorology program internship projects. We will present the students progression through the projects from their initial understanding and competencies to some final results and the skills learned along the way. Reanalyses are a leading research tool in weather and climate, but can also provide an introductory experience as well, allowing students to develop an understanding of the physical system while learning basic programming and analysis skills.",

(Millar et al., 2006) and is the last of the series of four contemporaneous tephra eruptions from three vents of the Inyo volcanic chain (Miller, 1985). Miller (1985) provides isopachs for the tephra and estimates a volume of 0.10 km3, whereas the methods of Fierstein and Nathenson (1992) give a volume of 0.13 km3.\nBursik and Sieh (2013) published measurements of thickness and used a cubic spline methodology to create isopachs. Their volume estimate is 0.08 km3. The projected thickness of their isopachs is 254 cm at zero area. Their highest measured thickness is 578 cm at about 1.5 km from the vent, and their isopachs do not include thickening at a higher rate in the proximal area.\nMaps of the thickness measurements and of the field locations made by Miller (1985) have been obtained and most of his measurements have been recovered and documented with locations. Combining the data sets results in a better overall coverage than either of the original studies. The 100-cm isopach is more similar to that of Miller (1985) than that of Bursik and Sieh (2013). The most distal isopach that is well defined by the data is 10 cm, whereas Miller (1985) could only close the 50-cm isopach. The revised volume is 0.087 km3.\nBursik, M., and Sieh, K., 2013, Digital database of the Holocene tephras of the Mono-Inyo Craters, California: U.S.G.S.

            "abstract": "Saturn’s moon Enceladus releases tens of kilograms per second of water-group neutrals from its southern plumes. These neutrals are ionized and accelerated by the background co-rotation electric field, producing a local population of pickup ions with a ring distribution in velocity space. This velocity space distribution is highly unstable to the growth of electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves whose amplitudes are generally related to the pickup ion production rate, the mass of the pickup ion, the pickup velocity, and the degree of damping by the background plasma. Observations from the Cassini spacecraft show the amplitudes of the waves generally increase with distance within 2 Enceladus radii of the Moon, consistent with an increasing density of pickup ion source, but then decrease right at the Moon, consistent with zero pickup velocity in the stagnating plasma flow. In order to interpret the observed wave amplitudes in terms of ion production rates at Enceladus, we carry out self-consistent hybrid simulations of the growth of ion cyclotron waves from pickup ions to determine the relationship between wave amplitude and background plasma and ion pickup conditions.",

            "abstract": "In paleoclimate and geodynamic studies large endorheic drainage basins generally provide long-term archives of hydro-climatological and tectonic changes including a transient topography. Sediment cascades from sources to sinks are playing a scale-depending role in the reconstruction of process dynamics by using sedimentary records.\nWe present a holistic study on the Hei He drainage basin at the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau by combining multi-disciplinary and multi-site approaches. The drainage system is crossing margins of extreme climatic conditions from the glaciated and permafrost sources within the >5000m high Qilian Shan to the hyper-arid Ejina Basin as endorheic sink with a catchment size of ca. 180,000 km2 and a endorheic basin area of approx. 28,000 km2. Two 230 m long drill-cores at the depocenter of Ejina basin recover a sedimentation history of about 250,000 years and integrate at least two glacial-interglacial cycles of climate change and a considerable geodynamic within the second largest strike-slip system in the world.\nSedimentation rate/subsidence estimations with consideration of climate-induced hydrological changes affecting the wider study and sink area provided data on the mountain uplift/basin development and the effects of tectonically induced changes of the drainage system. Based on 15 paleohydrological records covering the last ca. 35,000 years corroborated by >75 14C AMS data, we can demonstrate that water divides have been spatially variable with temporal opening of the endorheic system. Thus, small-scale changes in topography are able to explain extreme changes of sedimentation rates within long-term records in the depocenter.\nThe major fault systems in the drainage centers intensely modified the drainage system and catchment size resulting in extreme hydrological changes in the basin as recorded in the long-cores. A brief view into the Okavango system in Botswana indicates that the complexity of interrelated non-climatic processes of huge drainage basins crossing large fault systems and climate zones is not unique.",

            "abstract": "At this point in our settlement of the planet Earth, with over seven billion human inhabitants, there are very few unallocated sources of fresh water. We are turning slowly toward “alternatives” such as municipal and industrial wastewater, saline groundwater, the sea, irrigation return flow, and produced water that comes up with oil and gas deposits from deep beneath the surface of the earth. Slowly turning, not because of a lack in technological ability, but because it takes a large capital investment to acquire and treat these sources to a level at which they can be used. The regulatory system is not geared up for alternative sources and treatment processes. Permitting can be circular, contradictory, time consuming, and very expensive. The purpose for the water, or the value of the product obtained using the water, must be such that the capital and ongoing expense seem reasonable.\nThere are so many technological solutions for recovering water quality that choosing the most reliable, economical, and environmentally sound technology involves unraveling the “best” weave of treatment processes from a tangled knot of alternatives. Aside from permitting issues, which are beyond the topic for this presentation, the “best” weave of processes will be composed of four strands specifically fitted to the local situation: energy, pretreatment, driving force for separation processes, and waste management.\nA range of treatment technologies will be examined in this presentation with a focus on how the quality of the feed water, available power sources, materials, and waste management opportunities aid in choosing the best weave of treatment technologies, and how innovative use of a wide variety of driving forces are increasing the efficiency of treatment processes.",

            "abstract": "Kick’em Jenny is a frequently-erupting, shallow submarine volcano located ~8 km off the northwest coast of Grenada in the West Indies. The last eruption took place in 2001 but did not breach the sea surface. Focused and diffuse hydrothermal venting is taking place mainly within a small (~100 x 100 m) depression within the 300 m diameter crater of the volcano at depths of about 265 meters. Near the center of the depression clear fluids are being discharged from a focused mound-like vent at a maximum temperature of 180o C with the simultaneous discharge of numerous bubble streams. The gas consists of 93-96% CO2 with trace amounts of methane and hydrogen. A sulfur component likely contributes 1-4% of the gas total. Gas flux measurements on individual bubble streams ranged from 10 to 100 kg of CO2 per day. Diffuse venting with temperatures 5 to 35o C above ambient occurs throughout the depression and over large areas of the main crater. These zones are extensively colonized by reddish-yellow bacterial mats with the production of loose Fe-oxyhydroxides largely as a surface coating and in some cases, as fragile spires up to several meters in height. A high-resolution photo mosaic of the crater depression was constructed using the remotely operated vehicle Hercules on cruise NA039 of the E/V Nautilus. The image revealed prominent fluid flow patterns descending the sides of the depression towards the base. We speculate that the negatively buoyant fluid flow may be the result of second boiling of hydrothermal fluids at Kick’em Jenny generating a dense saline component that does not rise despite its elevated temperature. Increased density may also be the result of high dissolved CO2 content of the fluids, although we were not able to measure this directly. The low amount of sulphide mineralization on the crater floor suggests that deposition may be occurring mostly subsurface, in accord with models of second boiling mineralization from other hydrothermal vent systems.",

            "abstract": "Chemical production of ozone (O3) in the upper troposphere, where it is an important greenhouse gas, is controlled by NOx concentrations. NOx in the upper troposphere has several sources (lightning, transport from stratosphere, convection, and chemical production from reservoirs). However its primary sink is the production of HNO3. Recent studies have indicated that HNO3 production through the reaction of OH with NO2 is occurring at a slower rate in the atmosphere than in models. Other studies have indicated that the production of HNO3 has an additional source through the reaction of HO2 with NO. The Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC-3) experiment provided an opportunity to study the loss of NOx and simultaneous production of HNO3 at the high altitudes and low temperatures at the core of the current debate. In-situ measurements of OH, HO2, NO, NO2, and HNO3 were made with Lagrangian sampling in the outflow of convective storms. We observe a rate of HNO3 production (and NOx removal) directly from the measurements, finding the rate of NOx loss to be slower than current recommendations. We speculate the reasons for the discrepancy are due to the temperature dependence of the HOONO channel in the reaction of OH with NO2. The observations also put an upper limit on the production of HNO3 by the reaction of HO2 with NO. Those observations show NOx has a longer lifetime in the upper troposphere than indicated by current models. Thus, the NOx concentration is higher, and we calculate that O3 is produced more rapidly in the upper troposphere than in those same models.",

This presentation will focus on two new such architectures: USGS’s Science Data Catalog (SDC) and DOE’s Next Generation Ecological Experiments – Arctic Data System.\nThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) developed a Science Data Catalog (data.usgs.gov) to include records describing datasets, data collections, and observational or remotely-sensed data. The system was built using service oriented architecture and allows USGS scientists and data providers to create and register their data using either a standards-based metadata creation form or simply to register their already-created metadata records with the USGS SDC Dashboard. This dashboard then compiles the harvested metadata records and sends them to the post processing and indexing service using the JSON format. The post processing service, with the help of various ontologies and other geo-spatial validation services, auto-enhances these harvested metadata records and creates a Lucene index using the Solr enterprise search platform. Ultimately, metadata is made available via the SDC search interface.\nDOE’s Next Generation Ecological Experiments (NGEE) Arctic project deployed a data system that allows scientists to prepare, publish, archive, and distribute data from field collections, lab experiments, sensors, and simulated modal outputs. This architecture includes a metadata registration form, data uploading and sharing tool, a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) tool, a Drupal based content management tool (http://ngee-arctic.ornl.gov), and a data search and access tool based on ORNL’s Mercury software (http://mercury.ornl.gov).

            "abstract": "Areas along the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries are extremely vulnerable to hurricane flooding, as evidenced by the costly effects and severe impacts of recent storms along the Virginia coast, such as Hurricane Isabel in 2003 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Coastal wetlands, in addition to their ecological importance, are expected to mitigate the impact of storm surge by acting as a natural protection against hurricane flooding. Quantifying such interactions helps to provide a sound scientific basis to support planning and decision making. Using storm surge flooding from various historical hurricanes, simulated using a coupled hydrodynamic wave model (ADCIRC-SWAN), we propose an integrated framework yielding a geospatial identification of the capacity of Chesapeake Bay wetlands to protect critical infrastructure. Spatial identification of Chesapeake Bay wetlands is derived from the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI), National Land Cover Database (NLCD), and the Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP). Inventories of population and critical infrastructure are extracted from US Census block data and FEMA’s HAZUS-Multi Hazard geodatabase. Geospatial and statistical analyses are carried out to develop a relationship between wetland land cover, hurricane flooding, population and infrastructure vulnerability. These analyses result in the identification and quantification of populations and infrastructure in flooded areas that lie within a reasonable buffer surrounding the identified wetlands. Our analysis thus produces a spatial perspective on the potential for wetlands to attenuate hurricane flood impacts in critical areas.

It has had limited application in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific (EEP) and, prior to this study, has not been applied to a high-resolution record within this region. Here, we utilize the TEX86H temperature index to calculate a North-South temperature gradient in the EEP over the last ~25 kyr using two sediment cores, MV1014-02-17JC (located within the equatorial upwelling zone on the Carnegie Ridge) and MV1014-01-08JC (located North of the seasonal upwelling region on the Cocos Ridge). During the Late Holocene, the Cocos Ridge exhibited warmer TEX86H temperatures as compared to the Carnegie Ridge. The TEX86H calculated temperatures are within analytical error of both modern annual sea surface temperatures at each site and Mg/Ca-based SST estimates derived from Globigerinoides ruber. From 5.6 kyr to 8.5 kyr there is an abrupt ~3°C decrease in the TEX86H temperatures at the Cocos Ridge, marking a breakdown in the N-S temperature gradient. Then, similar TEX86H temperatures are calculated through the Early Holocene and into the deglacial as both sites cool into the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Interestingly, the temperature gradient switches during the LGM, with the Carnegie Ridge yielding temperatures 1-2°C warmer than the Cocos Ridge. This gradient reversal, in contrast, is not seen in the limited Mg/Ca temperatures measured during the LGM in the same core intervals. Instead, the calculated TEX86H temperatures from both sites are cooler than calculated Mg/Ca–SSTs from the near-surface dwelling planktonic foraminifera G. ruber. Additional foraminiferal Mg/Ca and stable isotope analyses will also be presented in an effort to better constrain deglacial changes in upper water column hydrography at both sites.",

            "abstract": "The reconstruction of eruptive processes from ejecta deposits is a vital element of volcano hazard assessment. Large-scale experiments provide an opportunity to test ejecta distribution and volume to energy and depth parameters for discrete blasts. Experiments conducted at the University at Buffalo Geohazards Field Station produced meter-scale craters with ejecta deposits. Repeated chemical explosions occurred in constructed strata of compacted aggregates (e.g. sands, gravels) with variable configurations. The experiments revealed that shallow blasts, low scaled depth (<0.004 m/J1/3), are required to produce significant extra-crater deposits. Sixteen discrete blasts produced ejecta between 5 -18 m from the blast center (> 2x crater radius). Each experiment had between one and four explosions in the same horizontal positions (pad), with variable charge depth and energy. The extra-crater deposits were collected up to 18 m from the blast center. Ejecta produced by discrete explosions can be divided into three zones: proximal, medial and distal. The proximal deposits form a constructional feature around the crater. Medial ejecta forms a thin continuous blanket and distal ejecta consists of isolated clasts scattered beyond the medial blanket. A strong relationship between the shape of the jet produced by shallow blasts and the distribution of ejecta were reproduced through the multiple experiments. The jet shape is controlled by crater geometry and condition. Therefore, crater geometry and condition influences ejecta distribution. Blasts that interact with an existing crater have more vertically focused jets. The elevation of the crater rim, enhanced by proximal deposits, contributes to future depositional patterns by producing confined jets. Small discrete blasts frequently have >50% of their volume in the proximal zone. These experiments show that deposit distribution is sensitive to surface geometries in addition to the energy and depth of the blast.",

            "abstract": "We examine an earthquake series in southern Peru that features a complex interaction of main- and after-shocks located in an active volcanic zone. The earthquakes started with the 17 July 2013 Mw 5.9 and 24 July 2013 Mw 4.0 earthquakes north-west 20 km NW of active Sabancaya volcano in the Andean Central volcanic Zone of Peru. During this time interval Sabancaya volcano experienced a strong seismic swarm, fumarole activity and earthquakes possibly related to fracturing of rock and fluid movements.\nWe analyze satellite InSAR data from the Italian Space Agency (ASI) COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) constellation and airborne InSAR data from the NASA UAVSAR. CSK provides a dense InSAR time series that track deformation from 2013 through 2014. Thanks to the short repeat interval of the CSK constellation we are able to discriminate between different earthquakes, aftershocks and post seismic processes leading to a better constraint of the sources. The initial coseismic interferograms from CSK provide a stunningly detailed image of the fault deformation, due in part to the high resolution, short wavelength (3.1 cm) of CSK, and the high coherence, and high elevation of the location. For such a relatively small earthquake there is significant shallow fault complexity and surface breaks evident. We found that post-seismic deformation starts immediately following the 17 July main event and is still ongoing. The post seismic deformation measured by the CSK InSAR time series shows a logarithmic time dependency for the southern part of the fault involved in the July 17 earthquake. Using a non-linear least squares approach we found a characteristic time constant of ~0.5 years. We found complex co-seismic and persistent post seismic deformation northeast of Sabancaya volcano possibly related to the complex fault system. To model the coseismic fault geometry and fault slip distribution we use a Bayesian method to solve for the basic fault geometry. This model forms the basis for a detailed constrained least-squares fault slip model whose geometry is constrained by fault surface breaks. The detailed model forms the starting solution for a Bayesian slip inversion based on the full data and model covariance. Finally, we will assess the occurrence of these events in relation to changes in volcanic activity at nearby Sabancaya volcano.",

            "abstract": "Some current estimates of GPS velocity uncertainties for continuous stations with more than a decade of data can be very low, < 0.1 mm per year. Yet, velocities with respect to rigid plates can be an order of magnitude larger, even in nominally stable plate interiors. This could be caused by underestimating low frequency, time-dependent noise, such as random walk. Traditional estimators, based on individual time series, are insensitive to low amplitude random walk, yet such noise significantly increases GPS velocity uncertainties.\nWe develop a new approach to estimating noise in GPS time series, focusing on areas where the signal in the data is well characterized. We analyze data from the seismically inactive parts of central US. The data is decomposed into signal, plate rotation and Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA), and various noise components. Our method processes multiple stations simultaneously with a Kalman Filter, and estimates average noise components for the network by maximum likelihood. Currently, we model white noise, flicker noise and random walk. Synthetic tests show that this approach correctly estimates the velocity uncertainty by determining a good estimate of random walk variance, even when it is too small to be correctly estimated by traditional approaches.\nWe present preliminary results from a network of 15 GPS stations in the central USA. The data is in a North America fixed reference frame, we subtract seasonal components and GIA displacements used in the SNARF model. Hence, all data in this reference frame is treated as noise. We estimate random walk of 0.82 mm/yr0.5, flicker noise of 3.96 mm/yr0.25 and white noise of 1.05 mm. From these noise parameters the estimated velocity uncertainty is 0.29 mm/yr for 10 years of daily data. This uncertainty is significantly greater than estimated by the traditional methods, at 0.12 mm/yr. The estimated uncertainty is still less than the median residual velocity in the North America fixed reference frame, which could indicate that the true uncertainties are even larger.\nAdditionally we estimated noise parameters and velocity uncertainties for the vertical component and for the data with common-mode signal removed. We are planning to extend this work by processing larger networks.",

            "abstract": "Mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions to avoid future climate change comes at a cost, because low-emission technologies are more expensive than GHG-emitting technology options. The increase in mitigation cost is not linearly related to the stabilization level, though: the first emission reductions are relatively cheap, but deeper emission reductions become more expensive. Therefore, emission reduction to medium levels of GHG concentrations , such as 4.5 or 6 W/m2, is considerably cheaper than emission reduction to low levels of GHG concentrations, such as 2.6 or 3.7 W/m2. Moreover, mitigation costs are influenced by many other aspects than the targeted mitigation level alone, such as whether or not certain technologies are available or societally acceptable (\nKriegler et al., 2014\n); the rate of technological progress and cost reduction of low-emission technologies; the level of final energy demand (\nRiahi et al., 2011\n), and the level of global cooperation and trade in emission allowances (\nden Elzen and Höhne, 2010\n).\nThis paper reviews the existing literature on greenhouse gas mitigation costs. We analyze the available data on mitigation costs and draw conclusions on how these change for different stabilization levels of GHG concentrations. We will take into account the aspects of technology, energy demand, and cooperation in distinguishing differences between scenarios and stabilization levels.\n",

            "abstract": "The development of radar-rainfall algorithms is typically based on assumed radar and rain drop models, which include the fitting of observed drop size distribution (DSD) data to some assumed mathematical model such as a gamma function. The objective of this study is to determine if and how the integration time of continuous disdrometer raindrop measurements may influence gamma model parameters, rain DSD moments such as rain rate, radar variables, and their relations. Previous studies have often utilized 1-minute DSD samples based largely on empirical experience. However, if radar and disdrometer observations are to be inter-compared, the appropriate spatial and temporal scales of radar must be considered. To make an approximate connection between radar horizontal and vertical spatial scales and disdrometer integration times, it should be noted that disdrometers measure rainfall beneath a storm that is in horizontal motion and that drops have various vertical fall speeds. Finally, the type of precipitation (e.g., stratiform vs. convective) should also be taken into account in the selection of integration time so that the implied temporal and spatial scales are consistent with the dominant precipitation processes. Based on these simple principles, it can be shown that 1, 2 and 3-minute DSD integration times are all potentially consistent with typical radar spatial scales and physical processes. However, the effects of these different sample periods on gamma fits, DSD moments and radar parameters are not well characterized. Hence, in this study, 1, 2 and 3-minute integration times are utilized for the analysis of 2-dimensional video disdrometer (2DVD) DSD data from the NASA GPM (Global Precipitation Mission) Iowa Flood Studies (IFloodS) ground validation (GV) experiment. The truncated method of moments is employed to estimate gamma fit parameters from binned 2DVD data for each of the sample periods. The gamma fit parameters are then used to calculate DSD moments and as input into a T-matrix scattering model for the calculation of radar parameters. The impact of the various integration periods on the resulting gamma fit parameters and radar-rain relations will be assessed in the context of NPOL radar observed storm morphology and precipitation processes during IFloodS.",

            "abstract": "Extreme conditions and events have always been a long standing concern in weather forecasting and national security. While some evidence indicates extreme weather will increase in global change scenarios, extremes are often related to the large scale atmospheric circulation, but also occurring infrequently. Reanalyses assimilate substantial amounts of weather data and a primary strength of reanalysis data is the representation of the large-scale atmospheric environment. In this effort, we link the occurrences of extreme events or climate indicators to the underlying regional and global weather patterns. Now, with greater than 3o years of data, reanalyses can include multiple cases of extreme events, and thereby identify commonality among the weather to better characterize the large-scale to global environment linked to the indicator or extreme event. Since these features are certainly regionally dependent, and also, the indicators of climate are continually being developed, we outline various methods to analyze the reanalysis data and the development of tools to support regional evaluation of the data.\nHere, we provide some examples of both individual case studies and composite studies of similar events. For example, we will compare the large scale environment for Northeastern US extreme precipitation with that of highest mean precipitation seasons. Likewise, southerly winds can shown to be a major contributor to very warm days in the Northeast winter. While most of our development has involved NASA’s MERRA reanalysis, we are also looking forward to MERRA-2 which includes several new features that greatly improve the representation of weather and climate, especially for the regions and sectors involved in the National Climate Assessment.",

            "abstract": "The mid-Pliocene has been proposed as a possible analogue for understanding future climate change and testing climate models. Previous work has shown that during the Pliocene the major upwelling systems were relatively warm, and thus either inactive, contracted, or upwelling warmer waters than present. Here we examine evidence from a core site located on the margins of the modern Benguela upwelling system, to test whether the upwelling cells had migrated or contracted relative to present during the Pliocene.\nWe applied several organic geochemistry proxies and foraminiferal analyses to reconstruct the Pliocene history of ODP site 1087 (31º28’S, 15º19’E, 1374m water depth), including the UK37’ index and TEX86 index (for reconstructing sea surface temperatures), chlorins (for estimating primary productivity) and planktonic foraminifera assemblages (for inferring water mass changes). These proxies show that between 3.5 and 3.0 Ma the southern Benguela region was significantly cooler than the northern Benguela region, the latter where the main upwelling cells are found today. Coupled with higher primary production, a shift in planktonic foraminifera assemblage, and an offset between the UK37’ index and TEX86 index, we infer that more extensive upwelling was present in the southern Benguela region during the Pliocene. We infer that the main Benguela upwelling cells had shifted southward relative to today, as a result of changes in the local wind field. We find evidence for pronounced cooling and a shift in the planktonic foraminifera assemblage during the M2 and KM2 glacial stages, showing a sensitivity of Benguela upwelling to these short-lived climate events.",

            "abstract": "The ability to monitor evapotranspiration (ET) from land surface is relevant for applications requiring spatially-resolved estimates of moisture availability over large areas. ET estimations from remote sensing data are generally based on parameterizations, such as canopy conductance(Gs) using optical vegetation indices. However, optical data presents some limitations related to the low temporal resolution and cloud contamination. Although characterized by coarser spatial resolutions, passive microwave sensors can be useful since they present shorter revisit times and are less affected by clouds and aerosols. In particular, microwave indices are known to be sensitive to vegetation moisture during growing season for forest ecosystems. In this work, we evaluate the performance of passive microwave frequency index (FI) and/or optical vegetation indices (VI) to retrieve ET over different forests under the Penman-Monteith (PM) method. Model results were validated in five FLUXNET sites over USA and Australia over three land covert type including deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF), evergreen needle leaf (ENF) and broadleaf forest (EDF). A subset of Gs values were then regressed against VIs, FI and a combination of FI and VI, and used to parameterize the PM equation for retrievals of ET (PM-Gs). The optical indices calculated from MODIS products were: NDVI, NDWI, and EVI. FI was calculated from AMSR-E passive microwave system. EVI and FI correlated well with Gs (coefficient of determination (R2) >0.5, root mean square error (RMSE)< 45 mm/s for EVI; and R2>0.5, RMSE < 47 mm/s for FI) for DBF. In general optical VI presents similar R2, but less RMSE. For evergreen forests, we found lower or poor relationships between vegetation indices and Gs. Finally, in terms of RMSE the coupled model (FI and EVI) resulted in a lower RMSE of 4-9% compared to independent relations (EVI-Gs and FI-Gs). Interestingly, these three models (PM-Gs) explained 80% of the variance of ET (RSME < 16 W/m2) for deciduous forests.",

            "abstract": "Over the last decade, enrollment in Northern Arizona University’s (NAU) Geologic Disasters (GLG112) class has grown to its current 840 students in 7 sections per semester (4% of NAU enrollment). Given this large audience composed of >50% freshmen, the course curriculum was re-designed in 2012 using standards set by NAU’s First Year Learning Initiative (FYLI), which seeks to increase academic success early in college. FYLI pedagogical principles include active-learning, frequent feedback, low-stakes assessments, and increased guidance from professors & peer teaching assistants (PTAs). As a result of the successes measured in FYLI courses, we launched a FYLI study abroad experience in 2014. We posed the question, “How can an early-career study abroad experience further develop the attitudes, skills, & behaviors necessary for success?” The pioneering program was NAU in Greece: The Cataclysmic Eruption of Santorini Volcano. Enrollment was limited to freshman & sophomore students who have taken GLG112 (or equivalent). The 3-week program took 9 students, 1 PTA, & 1 faculty member to Santorini (via Athens, 2 days). A detailed itinerary addressed a set of disciplinary & non-disciplinary learning outcomes. Student learning about Santorini volcano and the tectonic setting & hazards of the Aegean Sea occurred on the go – on ferries & private boat trips and during hiking, snorkeling, and swimming. Classroom time was limited to 1 hr/day and frequent assessments were employed. Student products included a geologic field notebook, travel journal, and 3 blog posts pertaining to geologic hazards & life on Santorini. Geologic disasters are ideal topics for early career study abroad experiences because the curriculum is place-based. Student learning benefits immensely from interacting with the land & local populations, whose lives are affected daily by the dangers of living in such geologically hazardous environments. The needs of early career students are unique, however, and must be addressed while planning. Planning should consider (1) location & lodging choices, (2) number of places visited, (3) group travel, (4) behavioral standards, (5) methods of early and frequent feedback, (6) timing, number, & style of assessments and writing assignments, and (7) multi-tiered instructional methods.",

By using a combination of observational data, reanalyses, and model studies, the salinity structure of this dichotomous yet interconnected region is quantified. At the surface, the largest driver of salinity interseasonal variability is caused by the monsoonal winds and their ability to transport volume between the two water masses. Time-depth profiles reveal a rich vertical salinity profile. The AS presents with a mild salinity inversion, with salty waters above fresher ones for the majority of each annual cycle. This vertical gradient is approximately 1 psu between the surface and 200m depth. In the BoB the opposite occurs, where larger volumes of precipitation and river runoff create a lens of freshwater from the surface to approximately 50m depth year around. Salt and freshwater fluxes at the surface show a strong zonal component between the two basins along Sri Lanka twice a year. Within the basins, meridional fluxes dominate especially along the coastal regions where the EICC and WICC flow. Meridional depth-integrated salt, freshwater, and volume transports along a slice of each basin at 6°N reveal the approximate time its takes for each basin to return to equilibrium after strong transports during each monsoonal seasons advect salt and/or freshwater into or out of each respective region.",

Air quality modeling plays a key role in developing emission control strategies for attaining the NAAQS in these regions and for estimating the incremental costs and benefits of meeting new NAAQS levels. The complex terrain, meteorology, emissions, and chemistry in California present challenges to such air quality modeling. In this study, we improve understanding of modeling approaches for California by comparing and evaluating predictions of the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model as configured by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Both simulations were conducted at 4-km horizontal resolution and cover the May-June 2010 period when special study measurements were made. Despite differences in emissions, meteorology, boundary conditions, and chemical mechanisms, the CMAQ predictions by EPA and CARB were generally similar with good model performance for ozone at key monitors. Differences in predictions for PM2.5 components were identified in some locations and attributed to differences in emissions and other platform elements. Our results suggest areas where model development would be beneficial.",

            "abstract": "Kīlauea's upper east rift zone (UERZ) extends ~3 km southeastward from the summit caldera to the Koaʻe fault system, where it starts to bend into the main part of the ENE-trending rift zone. The UERZ lacks a distinct positive gravity anomaly (though coverage is poor) and any evidence of deformation associated with magma intrusion. All ground ruptures—and the Puhimau thermal area—trend ENE, crossing the UERZ at a high angle. Lua Manu, Puhimau, and Koʻokoʻolau craters are the only surface evidence of the UERZ. Yet the UERZ is seismically active, and all magma entering the rest of the rift zone must pass through it. Rather than a rift zone in the traditional sense, with abundant dikes and ground ruptures along its trend, the UERZ cuts across the ENE structural grain and serves only as a connector to the rest of the rift zone, not a locus of dike formation along its length. The UERZ probably developed as a consequence of gradual SSE migration of the active part of the main east rift zone at the trailing edge of the south flank. During migration, a connection to the summit reservoir complex must be maintained; otherwise, the middle and lower east rift zone would starve and magma from Kīlauea's summit reservoir complex would have to go elsewhere. Over time, the UERZ lengthened and rotated clockwise to maintain the connection. Near the caldera, the UERZ may be widening westward as the summit reservoir complex migrates southward from the center of the caldera to its present position. A layered stress regime results in the upper 2–3 km mimicking the pervasive ENE structural grain of most of Kīlauea, whereas the underlying magmatic part of the UERZ responds to stresses related to SE magma transport. Magma intruding upward from the connector forms a dike that follows the ENE structural grain, as during the 1974 eruption. The active east rift zone has been migrating since ~100 ka, estimated by applying a 700-y extension rate across the Koa‘e fault system to the ~6.5 km of migration, and presumably the UERZ connector has been developing during this time.",

            "abstract": "13C magic angle spinning (MAS) solid state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (ssNMR) has become an essential tool for discerning the chemical composition of soil organic matter (SOM). However, the technique is limited due to the inherent insensitivity of NMR resulting in long acquisition times, especially for low carbon (C) soil. The pursuits of higher magnetic fields or concentrating C with hydrofluoric acid are limited solutions for signal improvement. Recent advances in dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) have addressed the insensitivity of NMR. DNP utilizes the greater polarization of an unpaired electron in a given magnetic field and transfers that polarization to an NMR active nucleus of interest via microwave irradiation. Signal enhancements of up to a few orders of magnitude have been achieved for various DNP experiments. In this novel study, we conduct DNP 13C cross-polarization (CP) MAS ssNMR experiments of SOM varying in soil C content and chemical composition. DNP signal enhancements reduce the experiment run time allowing samples with low C to be analyzed in hours rather than days. We compare 13C CP MAS ssNMR of SOM with multiple magnetic field strengths, hydrofluoric acid treatment, and novel DNP approaches. We also explore DNP surface enhanced NMR Spectroscopy (SENP) to determine the surface chemistry of SOM. The presented results and future DNP MAS ssNMR advances will lead to further understanding of the nature and processes of SOM.",

            "abstract": "Landslide hazards pose a major threat to communities exposed. Analyzing landslide hazard risk, apart from data on the probability of occurrence of the hazardous event information on the elements at risk is essential (Fuchs et al. 2013). Until now, there were only few approaches targeting at a small-scale spatial analysis of European mountain regions. In order to close this gap, we extracted information of the recently accomplished nation-wide digital building register in Austria. These data were spatially joined with the digital hazard maps in order to get an overview on exposure and, together with suitable vulnerability models, the height of mountain hazard risk.\nThe obtained results were analysed according to different parameters. In Fig. 1 the results are shown for every community, and clearly indicate that there is a considerable amount of people and residents potentially threatened by landslide hazards. Around 2.45 million buildings exist in Austria, 123,040 of which are exposed to red and yellow hazard zones (torrents: 113,876; snow avalanches: 9,164). Subtracting those buildings which are exposed to both torrents and snow avalanches, approximately 120,400 buildings remain (around 5 % of the building stock) with an overall value of € 67.25 billion (torrents: € 61.14 billion; snow avalanches: € 6.11 billion). In sum, around 430,000 people are exposed in these buildings (torrents: 399,253; snow avalanches: 30,158). Taking an overall population of 8.44 million this equals around 5 % of the residents.\nIf queried spatially on a municipal level, considerable differences were manifest throughout the country. In the Federal State of Salzburg around 17 % and in Tyrol 15 % of all buildings are exposed to torrents and snow avalanches, whereas in Vienna, Burgenland and Lower Austria this value is considerably smaller.\nOur analysis provides the basis for further analysis on the regional and local level. A nation-wide assessment of vulnerability to landslide hazards (including snow avalanches) provides insight in disaster hot spots and is essential for landslide risk management.\nFuchs, S.; Keiler, M.; Sokratov, S. & A.

            "abstract": "Mantle xenoliths and exhumed peridotite bodies from all tectonic settings record pervasive metasomatism of the mantle lithosphere by volatile-rich fluids. These fluids commonly enrich the lithospheric mantle not only in H2O but also K2O and Na2O as well as other minor elements. As a result, alkali-bearing hydrous phases (amphibole and biotite) become an important part of the mineralogy of mantle lithosphere. We have performed high-pressure-temperature experiments on alkali-enriched fertile and depleted mantle with low bulk H2O (0.65 wt.%) from 950 – 1150°C and 2 – 4 GPa to determine the stability fields and composition of these hydrous phases in the mantle as a function of temperature, pressure and bulk composition. We find that our stability field for amphibole at 0.65 wt.% H2O is similar to that of (1) and (2). This stability for amphibole extends to higher pressures and temperatures than that found by (3), indicating that bulk H2O content exercises an important control on hydrous mineral phase stability (4). We also find that metasomatic compositional changes induce other mineralogical changes. The stability and composition of other phases, particularly the typical aluminous phases spinel and garnet, are significantly affected by the formation of Al-bearing amphibole. We combine our experimental results with those of other experimental studies to more rigorously assess and quantify the influence of compositional changes in the lithospheric mantle on hydrous and anhydrous phase stability.

We compare temporal evolution and spatial patterns of annual climate extremes indices across multiple global gridded datasets of in situ observations and reanalyses to make inferences on the robustness of the obtained results.\nWhile there are distinct differences in the actual values of extremes, normalized time series generally compare well and temporal correlations are high for temperature extremes, in particular for the most recent three decades when satellite data are available for assimilation.\nExtreme precipitation is characterized by higher temporal and spatial variability than extreme temperatures, and there is less agreement between different datasets than for temperature. However, reasonable agreement between gridded precipitation extremes from the different datasets remains.\nWhile there is general agreement between the different reanalyses and gridded observational data in regions with dense observational coverage, different reanalyses show trends of partly opposing signs in areas where in situ observations are sparse, e.g. over parts of Africa and tropical South America. However, in the absence of reliable observations it is difficult to assess which reanalyses are more realistic here than others.\nUsing data from the 20th Century reanalysis and a novel century-long gridded dataset of extremes we also investigate consistency of extremes from these two datasets back to the beginning of the 20th Century. Global average time series of different extremes indices compare generally well over the past 70 years but show larger differences before around 1940. However, in areas with good observational coverage, including North America, Europe and Australia, agreement remains strong also throughout the earlier decades of the 20th Century.",

            "abstract": "The new Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS), launched on 28 October 2011 on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite, represents the next generation of the US ozone monitoring system. The OMPS Limb Profiler (LP) sensor measures solar radiances scattered from the atmospheric limb in the UV and visible spectral ranges and reconstruct the vertical ozone profiles from the cloud top up to 60 km. The regular LP observations started in early 2012, and now the LP data record exceeds 2.5 years. In this presentation we will demonstrate capability of the new LP sensor to characterize the vertical ozone distribution in different atmospheric regions that are most sensitive to the changes in the stratospheric composition and dynamics. We will consider: a) the seasonal ozone patterns in the lower stratosphere - upper troposphere; b) the vertical ozone distribution inside the Antarctic ozone hole; c) the ozone patterns forced by the Quasi-Biennial Oscillations in the lower tropical stratosphere. The main focus of this study is to perform a comprehensive analysis of ozone patterns obtained from OMPS LP with those observed by Aura MLS to isolate similarities and differences between two sensors in characterizing these processes. We will examine how well LP reproduces the named above natural signals in comparison with MLS in terms of amplitude, phase and vertical structure. One of the key issues is that two instruments measure ozone in different coordinate systems: the LP measures ozone profiles as number density on a regular altitude scale, while Aura MLS retrieves ozone profiles as mixing ratios on pressure vertical grids. The comparison of two measurements requires unit conversion that in turn involves temperature profiles. Thus, the uncertainties related to the unit conversion should be accounted during the analysis. This scientific validation is critical for the further LP algorithm improvement and continuation of the Aura MLS ozone record in the future.",

            "abstract": "Half-hourly estimates of precipitable water (PW) from ground-based GPS have been ingested by operational weather models in the U.S., demonstrably leading to more accurate forecasts, for a number of years. Ongoing upgrades to communications infrastructure in the western U.S. have enabled many GPS stations to stream data in real time at rates up to 1 Hz. At a number of these real-time sites in southern California, we have deployed prototype Geodetic Modules that can perform onsite Precise Point Positioning with Ambiguity Resolution (PPP-AR) position and troposphere delay solutions and stream the results at up to 1Hz for earthquake early warning (EEW) and weather hazard applications. This approach enables the next phase of development that includes a software upgrade to calculate the GPS PW at the site to eliminate the single point of failure when performing the processing at a central processing location. This also enables delivery of the processed results to various remote and local users in a continuous stream with no delay. We compare the 1 second troposphere delay estimates with 5 minute and 30 minute estimates to assure consistency with previous results. In addition to the benefits of zero latency communication for weather forecasting, the approach may yield a deployable real-time PW device that could be beneficial as a source of real-time PW in field studies.",

Quartz fiber filters (QFF) were used as the reaction surface and substrate and the analyses of parent PAHs and Nitro-PAH (NPAH) products was conducted using electron impact gas chromatographic mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and negative chemical ionization GC/MS. In parallel to the laboratory experiments, a theoretical study was conducted to assist in determining the formation of NPAH isomers based on the OH-radical initiated reaction. The thermodynamic stability of OH-PAH intermediates was used to indicate the position of highest electron density and the most stable NPAH products were synthesized to confirm their identity. NO2 and NO3/N2O5 were the most effective oxidizing agents in transforming PAHs deposited on filters to NPAHs, under the experimental conditions. Reaction of BaP-d12, BkF-d12 and BghiP-d12 resulted in the formation of several mono-nitro PAH isomer product, while the reaction of DalP and DaiP-d14 resulted in the formation of only one mono-nitro PAH isomer product. The direct-acting mutagenicity of the products increased the most after NO3/N2O5 exposure, particularly for BkF-d12 in which the formation of dinitro- PAHs was observed.\nIn addition, the degradation of particulate matter (PM)-bound PAHs by heterogeneous reaction with OH radicals, O3, NO3/N2O5 was also studied. Ambient PM samples collected from Beijing, China and Riverside, California were exposed in an indoor chamber under simulated trans-Pacific atmospheric transport conditions and the formation of NPAHs was studied. NPAHs were most effectively formed during the NO3/N2O5 exposure and, for all exposures, there was no significant formation of 2-nitrofluoranthene or 2-nitropyrene, suggesting that heterogeneous reactions predominated. The importance of this research with respect to atmospheric long-range transport of PM-bound PAHs and heterogeneous reaction of PAHs on terrestrial surfaces will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The Eddy-diffusivity/Mass-flux (EDMF) parameterization has been extremely successful in simulating the evolution of terrestrial atmospheric boundary layers. It is particularly suited for representing strong and moderate convection, where turbulence organizes in coherent structures and transports heat, humidity and pollution throughout the extent of the boundary layer. The EDMF’s ability to explicitly represent turbulent updrafts and associated fluxes is key to a proper depiction of the thermodynamic structure of the atmosphere. It is the most appropriate tool currently available to address the outstanding issues in the Mars atmosphere and dust modeling on a global and regional scale. Dust is one of the most important moderators of the Martian climate. Basic theoretical arguments and observations such as high-altitude dust maxima, dust layering, and transport in plumes during dust storm onset—none of which are currently captured in general circulation models (GCMs)—all demonstrate the vital importance of representing dust vertical mixing by plumes. Most GCMs, however, only consider local, Mellor-Yamada-type diffusion, which is insufficient to capture the evolving dust distribution and hence the Martian climate system correctly.\nHere, we developed an EDMF parameterization for the Martian convective boundary layer. We report on details of the parameterization and its performance as compared against large-eddy simulations. We investigate a downdraft contribution to turbulent fluxes and the importance of mass-flux transport of TKE. Furthermore, we investigate the role of plume heating—through absorption of solar radiation by uplifted dust particles—on the plume evolution (a mechanisms that could act as a surrogate of the latent heat release in terrestrial clouds). Our results shed light on the reasons behind the presence of elevated dust layers in the Martian atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Direct records of Quaternary sea level change can provide insight on the timing and nature of ice sheet retreat during glacial terminations. Such records are generally rare, particularly prior to the last deglaciation, due in part to the difficulty of recovering material from sites that have been submerged by subsequent sea-level rise. A suite of stalagmites recovered from a submerged cave on Argentarola Island in the Tyrrhenian Sea contains hiatuses that were formed when the cave became submerged by seawater. These hiatuses are remarkable due to the presence of calcite tubes secreted by serpulid worms, providing direct evidence of marine inundation. As sea level drops during the following glacial inception, the cave is drained and dense spelean calcite encases the serpulid worm tubes, forming alternating layers of spelean and serpulid calcite. U-Th dates of spelean calcite directly above and below these serpulid layers has previously been used to constrain timing and amplitude of sea level highstands in the Mediterranean. Stable isotope records from the same cave have also been used to indicate increased precipitation across the Mediterranean during Sapropel 6 (175 ka). Here we present U-Th dates and stable isotope records for three Argentarola stalagmites. These specimens were recovered from -22, -18, and -14 m relative to present sea level (rpsl), and complement previously published data for Argentarola stalagmites at -21, -18.5, and -18 m rpsl. The timing and elevation of spelean calcite directly above and below serpulid tube layers provide rare insight on rates of sea-level change between -14 and -22 m during glacial terminations and inceptions prior to the last termination. Stable isotope records from the same stalagmites are used to investigate changes in western Mediterranean climate and potential relationships to Mediterranean sapropel events.",

            "abstract": "There are many seismological aspects associated with monitoring of permanent storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) in geologic formations. Many of these include monitoring underground gas migration through detailed tomographic studies of rock properties, integrity of the cap rock and micro seismicity with time. These types of studies require expensive deployments of surface and borehole sensors in the vicinity of the CO2 injection wells. Another problem that may exist in CO2 sequestration fields is the potential for damaging induced seismicity associated with fluid injection into the geologic reservoir. Seismic hazard monitoring in CO2 sequestration fields requires a seismic network over a spatially larger region possibly having stations in remote settings. Expensive observatory-grade seismic systems are not necessary for seismic hazard deployments or small-scale tomographic studies. Hazard monitoring requires accurate location of induced seismicity to magnitude levels only slightly less than that which can be felt at the surface (e.g. magnitude 1), and the frequencies of interest for tomographic analysis are ~1 Hz and greater.\nWe have developed a seismo/acoustic smart sensor system that can achieve the goals necessary for induced seismicity monitoring in CO2 sequestration fields. The unit is inexpensive, lightweight, easy to deploy, can operate remotely under harsh conditions and features 9 channels of recording (currently 3C 4.5 Hz geophone, MEMS accelerometer and microphone). An on-board processor allows for satellite transmission of parameter data to a processing center. Continuous or event-detected data is kept on two removable flash SD cards of up to 64+ Gbytes each. If available, data can be transmitted via cell phone modem or picked up via site visits. Low-power consumption allows for autonomous operation using only a 10 watt solar panel and a gel-cell battery. The system has been successfully tested for long-term (> 6 months) remote operations over a wide range of environments including summer in Arizona to winter above 9000’ in the mountains of southern Colorado. Statistically based on-board processing is used for detection, arrival time picking, back azimuth estimation and magnitude estimates from coda waves and acoustic signals.",

Understanding of sheaths is important for understanding planetary surface processes, dust charging and transport, as well as in-situ measurements and exploration. Sheath formation can be complicated. Fundamentally, there are three kinds: classical (ion-dominated), space-charge-limited or SCL (non-monotonic), and inverse (electron-dominated). All the three kinds of sheaths can, in general, exist above the surface of small bodies that both collect (e.g., solar wind plasma) and emit (e.g., photoelectrons and secondary electrons) charged particles. For the first time, we do laboratory experiments to show the emergence of all these sheaths by changing a single parameter: the ratio of emitted to collected electron currents. In the experiments, plasma is created using a hot filament to emit energetic primary electrons to ionize neutral particles. Secondary electrons are also created from a surface where the primary electrons bombard. By changing the neutral pressure, the thermal electron density is changed from higher to lower than the secondary electron density, showing a change in sheath structure from classical through SCL to inverse profiles. We investigate the conditions for the formation of these sheathes and their properties.",

            "abstract": "Northern California's Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is surrounded by many agricultural fields, making is susceptible to increased ammonia levels from nutrient rich fertilizer runoff. Last year we noticed a large bloom of Water Hyacinth, an invasive species from South America, throughout many channels of the delta which led us to believe that there was an abundance of ammonia in the water. We hypothesized this with the prior knowledge that Water Hyacinth feeds on ammonia and thrives in places with high levels of ammonia in the water. Because there are no current regulation standards for ammonia levels in the Delta, we decided to test eight points around the delta to see whether or not the ammonia levels exceed regulatory standards of nearby waters. After determining the ammonia levels of each of our eight samples, we compared the data that we collected to the maximum levels of ammonia allowed in the Central San Francisco Bay, which is 0.16 ppm. We discovered that each point that we tested in the delta had ammonia levels much lower than 0.16 ppm. With these results we concluded that unusually high levels of ammonia is not a concern in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.",

            "abstract": "Since black carbon and brown carbon are among the greatest contributors to radiative forcing (black carbon being second only to carbon dioxide), this work focuses on the laboratory measurement of their optical properties using cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) and integrating nephelometry. Water soluble soot is collected using an impinger by burning different fuel types to mimic ambient aerosols dominant in regions where biomass burning is the main source of aerosols. Using an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) as a light source, we are able to measure extinction and scattering over a wide range of wavelengths. The extinction-minus-scattering method is then used to determine particle absorption and single scattering albedo for soot collected from different fuel sources at different stages of burning. Purely scattering polystyrene latex (PSL) spheres of known sizes (100 – 700 nm) are used in the lab to calibrate the system for this study. Our preliminary measurements of optical properties of soot samples collected by burning different wood samples will be reported. A correction method that properly accounts for and reduces systematic extinction uncertainties, random scattering and extinction errors, and reconciles nephelometer with CRDS measurements is used.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic climate change is expected to change the discharge and sediment-transport regime of river systems. Because rivers adjust their channels to accommodate their typical inputs of water and sediment, changes in these variables can potentially alter river morphology. Here, I developed and applied a hierarchical modeling approach to examine potential changes in reach-averaged bedload transport and spatial patterns of erosion and deposition for three snowmelt-dominated gravel-bed rivers in the interior Pacific Northwest (the Tucannon River in southeastern Washington and the South Fork Coeur d’Alene and Red rivers in Idaho). The modeling hierarchy was based on discharge and suspended-sediment load from a basin-scale hydrologic model driven by a range of downscaled climate-change scenarios. In the field, I collected channel morpholohy and sediment grain-size data for all three rivers. To estimate changes in reach-averaged bedload transport, I used the Bedload Assessment of Gravel-bedded Streams (BAGS) software. I then used the Cellular Automaton Evolutionary Slope and River (CAESAR) model to simulate the spatial pattern of erosion and deposition within each reach to infer potential changes in channel geometry and planform. Results from the BAGS sediment-transport formulas indicate that changes in the duration of the critical discharge needed to mobilize bed sediments are the primary drivers of changes in reach-averaged sediment transport. CAESAR modeling results include changes in river morphology for the two higher-energy river reaches, but no significant morphological changes for a lower-energy reach with steep, cohesive banks, suggesting that the geomorphic response of river systems to climate change may depend on how reach characteristics affect a river’s relative stability or mobility. Changes in sediment transport and river morphology resulting from climate change could affect the management of river systems for human and ecological uses.",

            "abstract": "The differences in winter synoptic-scale flow during precipitation events between phases of El Niño–Southern Oscillation are established for the coastal southwest United States. Principal component analysis in T-mode with Varimax rotation was performed on fields of 500-hPa, 700-hPa, and 850-hPa geopotential height and specific humidity (from the North American Regional Reanalysis) during days with precipitation. These precipitation days were grouped through a k-means cluster analysis of the loadings on the extracted components from all atmospheric variables. Eight clusters were ultimately analyzed based on separation and cohesion statistics. Analyses of cluster membership and cluster composite maps reveal synoptic-scale patterns that are most common during particular phases of ENSO. Distinctly El Niño patterns are charactized by a broad offshore upper level trough with relatively moist low-level onshore flow. Distinctly La Niña patterns display a deep southwest-northeast oriented trough over the western United States with drier low-level onshore flow. Analysis of 250-hPa potential vorticity suggests that the La Niña (El Niño) patterns are linked to anticyclonic (cyclonic) baroclinic wave breaking events. This agrees with a recent line of investigations which find anticyclonic (cyclonic) wave breaking in the Pacific North American region to be more common during La Niña (El Niño) events. Knowledge of interannual variability in winter precipitation event characteristics can improve seasonal runoff forecasts and advance understanding of interdecadal variability and the effects of climate change in the western United States.",

            "abstract": "MASW approaches are suitable for the accurate measurement of variably thick weathering profiles by producing shear-wave (Vs) profiles. The critical zone (CZ) base is usually a transitional boundary, which is captured by MASW but not by conventional seismic reflection techniques.\nModified MASW methods were used in Hawaii, USA to extend the investigative depth of saprolite (kaolin clays, Fe-oxides) thickness calibrated against wells with geologic logs. Active-source ± passive dispersion curves produced improved low-frequency fundamental modes by combining records with varying source-receiver offsets, enabling the generation of Vs profiles to >50 m depth. The top of unaltered bedrock occurs at a Vs of >~500 m/s. Intra-saprolite high Vs zones probably represent aa flow interiors with fewer primary discontinuities (vesicles and fractures), therefore imparting higher secondary stiffness than altered pahoehoe and pyroclastic material.\nThe MASW approach permits measuring CZ thicknesses at discrete locations rapidly, inexpensively, and without drilling. For example, employed on slopes of the Koolau Volcano (neither aggrading nor degrading), the downward rate of advance of the weathering front of the CZ varies from 0.02 to 0.03 mm/yr in wet and ~0.01 mm/yr in dry areas. This compares well with recent work based on solute mass fluxes averaged over large areas. MASW can be deployed in a variety of settings where rapid estimation of the CZ thickness at particular locations is desired.",

            "abstract": "Internal gravity waves, and the energy and momentum they transport, are a key process governing the dynamics and structure of the middle and upper atmosphere, but are significantly underconstrained in current weather and climate models due to their small physical scale relative to typical model grids. In particular, the simulation of such waves is believed to underlie a major momentum deficit in the high-latitude southern hemisphere, due to underestimation of the gravity wave drag provided by waves generated by sub-gridscale island sources.\nThe South Georgia Wave Experiment (SG-WEX) is a coordinated programme to investigate the most important such small island source, South Georgia Island. This will be carried out via the deployment of a mesospheric-sensing meteor radar, stratospheric satellite measurements, and two month-long tropospheric radiosonde campaigns, backed up by detailed high-resolution modelling of the region at all altitudes. The ultimate goal of the project is to significantly enhance our geophysical understanding of wave dynamics in the region and, more directly, to provide a basis for a dramatic improvement in the parameterisation of the wave momentum flux generated by such small-island sources, with consequent effects on the skill of global weather and climate models both in this region and globally.\nHere, we present preliminary results from the satellite and modelling components of the project. In particular, we use combined measurements from the HIRDLS, SABER, AIRS and COSMIC satellite instruments and analyses from the HadGEM GCM to produce a detailed temporal and spatial climatology of wave fluxes in the region, due both to South Georgia and to the nearby Andes and Antarctic Peninsula. We also briefly look ahead to the deployment of the meteor radar and first radiosonde campaign in January 2015, and discuss how these are expected to enhance our understanding of the dynamics of the region.",

            "abstract": "We have applied machine learning, specifically the technique of random decision forests (RDF), to predict densely spaced values of sparsely sampled seafloor sediment attributes relevant to gas hydrate occurrence. The results of global gas hydrate stability models using these new grids are similar to previously published predictions (the newly derived heat flow alone changes pore space volume in the global gas hydrate stability zone by ~3%), but our model inputs are statistically rigorous estimates (including uncertainties) of sub-seafloor sediment properties. Specifically we use as input recently updated, sparsely sampled, yet globally extensive datasets of seafloor temperature, salinity, porosity, organic carbon content, and fluid flux. The RDF estimate is based on empirical statistical relationships between the relevant parameters and other parameters for which we have more densely sampled estimates (e.g. water depth, seafloor temperature, mixed layer depth, sediment thickness, sediment grain type and crustal age). We create additional attributes by applying statistical analyses and physical models to existing densely sampled attributes. These statistics include mean, median, variance, and other parameters, over a variety of ranges from 5 to 500km. The physical models include established models of compaction, heat conduction, and diagenesis, as well as recently derived estimates of fluid flux at convergent margins. Over 600 densely sampled attributes are used in each prediction, and for each predicted grid, we calculate the relative importance of each input attribute. The RDF technique and resulting sediment model also show promise for global models outside the discipline of gas hydrates.",

Microhardness test was utilized to evaluate the change in cement mechanical properties. Nanovea® Nano/Micro-Indenter is based on the standards for instrumented indentation, ASTM E2546 and ISO 14577. The indenter tip with a known geometry (Vickers Diamond) is driven into the cement sample to be tested, by applying an increasing normal load. Analysis of indentation test results on the cement samples showed: (a) a decrease of both Young’s modulus and hardness after increasing w/c and/or water salinity, and (b) additives have a significant impact on both hardness and Yong’s modulus.\nThe most likely mechanism behind all changes in cement structure and its properties is that the difference of cement components resulted in a change of the cement matrix porosity and grain size. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) imaging also indicated changes in cement, as can be observed from micrographs of control and altered cement taken at the same magnification.

            "abstract": "We investigate what triggers the rapid drainage of a large supraglacial lake on the western margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet using a Network Inversion Filter (NIF) (Segall and Matthews, 1997) to invert a dense local network of GPS observations over three summers (2011-2013). The NIF is used to determine the spatiotemporal variability in ice sheet behavior (1) prior to lake drainage, and in response to (2) vertical hydro-fracture crack propagation and closure, (3) the opening of a horizontal cavity at the ice-sheet bed that accommodates the rapid injection of melt-water, and (4) extra basal slip due to enhanced lubrication. The NIF also allows us to infer the distribution of melt-water at the ice-sheet bed before, during, and after drainage. Our data show that the opening and propagation of each summer’s lake-draining hydro-fracture is preceded by a local stress perturbation associated with ice sheet uplift and enhanced slip above pre-drainage background velocities. Within <1 day after the onset of each precursor, a vertical crack propagates through the lake basin and the lake drains rapidly (<5 hours). The NIF shows that the precursors are not associated with slow propagation of the lake draining hydrofracture, but rather pre-existing crevasses and/or moulins, which allow substantial amounts of melt-water to reach the bed and activate enhanced basal slip up to a day before hydro-fracture crack initiation. Identification of these precursors combined with the fact that drainages are observed to occur across a range of lake volumes and geometries, suggests that lakes do not spontaneously hydro-fracture once they surpass a specific threshold despite the numerous healed hydro-fracture cracks present within the lake basin from the prior years’ drainage events. These results have implications for rapid drainage of supraglacial lakes in less crevassed, interior regions of the Greenland Ice Sheet, as well as the rapid collapse of Antarctic ice shelves through melt pond hydro-fracturing.\n",

            "abstract": "The ongoing climate warming in the Arctic has caused rapid terrestrial ecosystem changes, including shrub expansion and permafrost thaw. Here we used results from a peat-accumulating permafrost tundra in upper Imnavait Creek on the Arctic foothills of Alaska (68° 36’ N, 149° 18’ W) to investigate ecological responses to recent climate warming in the context of the last millennium. Six peat soil cores were collected from Sphagnum mosaics along an elevational gradient from 906 m to 950 m on a hillslope covered by Eriophorum-dominated tussock tundra. Macrofossil analysis documents a consistent development sequence among all cores from a mineral soil to a minerotrophic sedge peat and finally to an ombrotrophic Sphagnum peat. The 14C dating results show the ages of peat initiation range from about 900 to 140 cal BP, but do not follow the elevation gradient, suggesting the dominant control of local factors. The Sphagnum onset begins at 1820 AD near the ridge top, and subsequently propagates downslope to the floodplain at 2008 AD. This transition (ombrotrophication) was likely in response to Arctic warming, and subsequent permafrost thaw and active layer thickening, leading to drying initiating at the ridge top and facilitating Sphagnum colonization. Pollen analysis of the master core UIC13-3 at 916 m elevation (basal age 700 cal BP) shows that the vegetation was dominated by sedges (up to 84%) during the cool Little Ice Age until 1800 AD, followed by increases in shrubs first from dwarf birch (Betula nana) (up to 57%) and then willows (Salix spp.) up to 62% in the 1960s. These results indicate that shrub expansion of willows, due to accelerated warming in recent decades, was preceded by birch expansion over the last two centuries. Our new results provide a long-term perspective on ecological transformations in the Arctic, in particular the history of recent shrub expansions and the process of peatland initiation and expansion across Arctic tundra.",

            "abstract": "Deep-sea foraminiferal oxygen isotope curves (δ18Of) are excellent paleoclimate records but are limited as proxies of global ice volume history during orbital glacial-interglacial cycles (GIC) due to the influence of deep-sea bottom water temperature, regional hydrography, ocean circulation and other factors affecting δ18Of. A more direct source of northern hemisphere [NH] ice history comes from central Arctic Ocean (CAO) submarine ridges (Northwind, Mendeleev, Lomonosov) where, at orbital timescales, sedimentation is controlled by the growth and decay of ice sheets, ice shelves, and sea ice. Calcareous microfossil density in CAO sediments is one of many proxies, such as manganese concentrations, grain size, bulk density, color, mineral content, organic geochemistry, and foraminiferal δ18O, that reveal GIC changes in ice cover, biological productivity, and primary and post-depositional sediment processes. In order to better understand NH ice history, we constructed 600-kyr-long stacked records of Arctic foraminiferal and ostracode density (AFD, AOD) from 19 CAO sediment cores following stacking and astronomical tuning procedures used for deep-sea δ18Of curves. Results show discrepancies between the Arctic AFD and AOD curves, the LR04 δ18Of stack (Lisiecki and Raymo 2005, Paleoceanography), the Red Sea and Mediterranean δ18Of sea level curves (Rohling et al. 2014 Nature), and modeled Antarctic Ice Sheet volume, suggesting asynchronous polar ice sheet behavior in the two hemispheres, notably during MIS 3, 5a, 5c, 7d, and 11.",

            "abstract": "Saline soils are common in arid zones, where evaporation from shallow groundwater is generally the main component of the water balance. Thus, to correctly manage water resources in these zones, it is important to quantify the evaporation fluxes. Evaporation from saline soils is a complex process that couples the movement of salts, heat, liquid water and water vapor, and strongly depends on the soil water content. Precipitation/dissolution reactions can change the soil structure and alter flow paths, modifying evaporation fluxes. We utilized the HYDRUS-1D model to investigate the effects of salinity on soil hydraulic properties and evaporation fluxes. HYDRUS-1D simulates the transport of liquid water, water vapor, and heat, and can incorporate precipitation/dissolution reactions of the major ions. To run the model, we determined the water retention curve for a soil with different salinities; and we used meteorological forcing from an experimental site from the Atacama Desert. It was found that higher sodium adsorption ratios in the soil increase the soil water retention capacity. Also, it was found that evaporation fluxes increase salts concentration near the soil surface, changing the soil’s water retention capacity in that zone. Finally, movement of salts causes differences in evaporation fluxes. It is thus necessary to incorporate salt precipitation/dissolution reactions and its effects on the water retention curve to correctly simulate evaporation in saline soils",

            "abstract": "Refractory black carbon (rBC) aerosol is mostly emitted into the atmosphere from biomass burning and incomplete combustion of fossil and biofuel. Emissions of rBC are strongly linked to anthropogenic activity, with potential for short-term mitigation strategies. rBC aerosol is currently the second largest anthropogenic climate forcing agent after CO2(g) with the total radiative forcing of 0.64 W m-2. Its climate impacts, which depend in part on vertical distribution and internal mixing state, are not fully understood. Internal mixing of rBC with sulfate was previously predicted by the aerosol-climate model, ECHAM5-HAM, to increase the aerosol absorption optical depth by 10 – 30 % despite decreasing the atmospheric burden of rBC by 10 – 20 % in the Southeastern U.S. The measurements of rBC from Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) instruments onboard the NOAA WP-3D research aircraft during the SENEX study constrain chemical aging of rBC by sulfate in coal-fired power plant plumes, and hence, constrain the model predictions. The number fraction of rBC-containing particles that can be identified as coated (CF) and the estimated coating thickness (CT) of non-rBC material internally mixed in them were in many cases higher (1 – 5 %, 1 - 12 nm) in power plant plume intercepts downwind of the power plants than in the background air. However, there was a lack of a clear pattern of increase in CT and CF with an age of a power plant plume, and the respective growth rates were only 3.5 ± 0.8 nm hr-1 and 1.1 ± 0.5 % hr-1 at maxima. This is likely the consequence of the condensation of sulfate on non-rBC particles, which are present in higher concentrations in the power plant plumes. The impacts of the observed CT and CF growth rates on the lifetime and radiative properties of rBC in the Southeast U.S. will be further discussed and compared to the model predictions.",

            "abstract": "Circulation in bays with one or more connections to the ocean depends on the location and morphology of the inlets. Here, field observations and the numerical model ADCIRC are used to investigate circulation in the small (~7 km2 surface area) and shallow (~2 m deep) Katama Bay, Martha’s Vineyard, MA, which is connected to Vineyard Sound in the north by the long (~2.5 km), stable, maintained Edgartown Channel, and to the Atlantic Ocean in the south by the variable and ephemeral Katama Inlet, which changes shape in response to storms, as well as to daily waves and tides. Katama Inlet was initiated by a breach in 2007, and has migrated almost 2.5 km to the east where it is now adjacent to Chappaquiddick Island. In a typical decadal cycle, the inlet eventually closes until another storm breaches the sand barrier. As it migrates, Katama Inlet varies in width, length, depth, and orientation. The bathymetry near the inlet was measured pre- and post Hurricane Irene (2011), and in the summers of 2012-2014. In addition, sea levels, waves, and currents were measured in the ocean, the inlets, and the bay from August until October 2011 (including during Hurricane Irene), and in August 2013. Between 2011 and 2013 the inlet migrated 1 km to the east and changed alignment from roughly north-south to east-west. Pressure data from the Atlantic Ocean and northern Edgartown Channel are used to drive ADCIRC using bathymetry measured (1) pre- and (2) post-Irene in 2011, and (3) in 2013. The model is run over month-long periods using a variable Manning’s n for friction and including wetting and drying of the coast. The model simulations are consistent with the observations, including the observed changes to the circulation caused by the evolving inlet channel. The results suggest that changes in the geometry, orientation, and location of one inlet may have significant effects on hydrodynamics throughout the bay and in the other channel.\nSupported by ASD(R&E), ONR, and NSF.",

For sediments containing the same amount of hydrates, their overall physical properties may vary several orders of magnitude depending on hydrate pore habit. We investigate the interplay among hydrate formation methods, hydrate pore habits, and fundamental physical properties of hydrate bearing sediments. We have developed a new method to synthesize noncementing hydrate in sands, a multi-properties characterization chamber to test the hydrate bearing sediments, and pore network models to simulate fluid flow processes in hydrate bearing sediments. We have found that (1) the growth pattern of hydrate crystal in the pore spaces of water saturated sediments is dominated by the relative magnitude of the capillary force (between hydrate crystal and pore fluid) and the skeleton force, which will result in pore-filling or grain-displacing type of hydrate pore character; (2) the existing capillary tube models of water permeability in hydrate bearing sediments are sensitive to pore geometry and hydrate pore habit; and (3) preliminary CT results suggest that hydrate nucleation in partially water saturated sands tends to agglomerate in patches, rather than in an uniformly-distributed contact-cementing morphology. Additional CT results with a small amount of fines (5wt%) and visualization via micro-CT of hydrate pore habits in sediments using different hydrate formation methods will be discussed.",

Preliminary tests with a full complement of atmospheric physics, using both variable-resolution and uniform meshes, indicate that the dynamical solver is robust. MPAS-A tests using variable-resolution meshes in the hydrostatic regime, where convection is parameterized, show no obvious problems appearing in or around the mesh transition zones for regional climate (years) and weather prediction (days to weeks) timescales. We are now testing meshes spanning hydrostatic (dx > 10 km) to nonhydrostatic (dx ~ few km) scales. These applications require a more sophisticated treatment of the atmospheric physics, particularly for the parameterization of deep convection. Several extensions of existing deep-convection physics schemes are being developed for MPAS-A applications bridging the hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic regimes. We will present results illustrating the current capabilities of MPAS-A for multi-scale atmospheric simulation in these regimes with the new deep convection schemes, focusing on explicitly simulated severe convective events over the US.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the feedbacks among climate, permafrost, and vegetation is crucial for assessments of arctic ecosystem vulnerability and response to climate change, and for development of sustainable engineering and management methods associated with infrastructure. Vegetation, snow cover, and near-surface soil organic layers are key determinants in regulating the energy exchange between the atmosphere and the deeper soils. Here we present high-temporal resolution soil thermal regime data over annual time extents for multiple sites at two locations in the Low Arctic of northwestern Siberia. At a location near Nadym, Russia, we measured soil temperatures at various depths in the soil profile (down to 60 cm) at three sites: 1) a boreal forest stand with lichen understory and a shallow organic layer (8 cm), 2) a young, cryoturbated Sphagnum peatland with soil organic layers to 40 cm depth, and 3) an old Sphagnum peatland with deep organic soil horizons (58+ cm). At a location near Kharp, Russia, we measured soil temperatures at 5 and 20 cm depth for sites along a chronosequence of tall alder shrub expansion, from short-statured tundra to mature and old alder stands, with deeper organic layers. The deeper snow accumulation at the Nadym forest site kept winter soil temperatures dramatically warmer than the peatland soils, up to 8 °C difference, but the shading of the forest tended to cool the surface during the summer. The overall effect of the forest was cooler summer soils in the near-surface layers, yet warmer summer soils at the deeper layers (20-60 cm). The forest location had substantially greater thawing degree days at depth (20-60 cm), compared to the Sphagnum peatlands. At the Kharp site, mature alder shrub stands cooled summer soil temperatures relative to shorter tundra by up to 8 °C (at 20 cm depth), yet warmed winter soils by greater than 10 °C. Mature and old shrubland locations had reduced thawing degree days at 20 cm depth relative to short-statured vegetation. Both datasets suggest that the surface and soil organic layers play a key role in buffering active layer deepening in the summer, potentially preventing permafrost from degradation with warming temperatures; therefore, land management efforts that support and maintain thick organic layers are essential for permafrost stability.",

In order to understand this relationship we have mapped existing landslides on Google Earth images and ESRI base maps, assembled high-resolution digital topographic data by digitizing Nepal Government published topographic maps, and gathered geological data from detailed field mapping and compilation of published geological maps. Slope angle and aspect, and dip direction and angle were extracted from GIS-based digital topographical and geological datasets to develop the new slope maps with cataclinal (dip) and anaclinal (escarp) slope distributions. Longitudinal river profiles were also extracted from high resolution DEM's derived from manually digitized contours. The slope maps with cataclinal and anaclinal slope distributions, earthquake epicenters, major geological structures, longitudinal river profiles, and landslide inventories were visualized in ESRI ArcMap 10.2 to examine the spatial correlation among landslides, fault zones, cataclinal slopes and river steepness index. We have found that landslides are spatially correlated with cataclinal slopes and fluvial knick zones with high steepness index in certain thrust boundaries. The main finding of this work is that the topographic slope threshold alone is a crude measure of landslide susceptibility. The analysis of slope using the geometric relationship among topography and geological bedding is crucial for determining landslide susceptibility in the Himalayan region.",

The synergy between space-borne observations and high-resolution simulation is investigated through a series of large-eddy simulations (LES) that are based on A-Train observations of marine cloudy boundary layers. The main aims of the study are to advance the understanding of the atmospheric boundary layer physics and increase the utility of both observations and modeling. Using a combination of multi-sensor A-train data and model reanalysis, high resolution, cloud regime-type large-eddy simulations of selected scenes are carried out. For instance, temperature, humidity profiles and sea surface temperature from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), and geostrophic wind from reanalysis are used in the LES. Although the AIRS soundings lack fine structure in the boundary layer and often exhibit small deviations from the actual atmospheric state, the simulations show that a more precise profile can be obtained. The quantitative characteristics of the cloud structure are used to compare the LES results with reflectances from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Implications related to the dynamics of the boundary layer and its modeling in global models are also discussed.",

            "abstract": "Mountain meadows are important ecological habitats that have degraded in quality and distribution due to fire suppression and poor land use practices in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Conifer encroachment in mountain meadows has accelerated and is one of the reasons for the decline of meadow habitat. To date there are few studies which quantify the hydrologic response of meadow restoration due to vegetation or conifer removal. This study is using a before after control intervention (BACI) study design to determine the hydrologic response of restoration to a historic meadow encroached by conifers (study meadow). A water budget approach has been developed to quantify the hydrology of the control and study meadow before and after restoration. Measurements of groundwater depth and soil moisture are currently being taken on the control and study meadows. A total of 14 Odyssey water level capacitance instruments were installed to a 1.5 meter depth and 14 soil moisture instruments were installed to a 30 cm depth using a spatially balanced random sampling approach. Electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) was used to determine soil moisture and depth to groundwater across forest-meadow ecotones present on the meadows. Additionally, ERI was used to extrapolate point measurements of groundwater depth and soil moisture across the study and control areas. The weekly water budget indicates differences between the control meadow and study meadow in the first year prior to conifer removal. The ERI indicated differences in sub surface geology, soil moisture, and groundwater depth both between the control and study meadows and along the forest-meadow ecotones. ERI was demonstrated to improve the spatial extrapolation of soil moisture and groundwater point measurements.",

Effective water management in agricultural systems is especially important for irrigation and water quality. This research explores the implications of tradeoffs between maximization of crop yield and minimization of nitrogen loss to the environment, primarily to surface water and groundwater, in rice production in Sri Lanka. We run the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model under Sri Lankan climate and soil conditions. The model serves as a tool to simulate crop management scenarios with different irrigation and fertilizer practices in two climate regions of the country. Our investigation uses DNDC to compare rice yields, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and nitrogen leaching under different cultivation scenarios. The results will inform best practices for farmers and decision makers in Sri Lanka on the management of water resources and crops.",

            "abstract": "The winter anomaly in F-region electron density has long been tied to changes in neutral composition between summer and winter. In practice, the appearance of the winter anomaly depends primarily on the balance between the effect of the solar zenith angle on ionization and the neutral composition in the winter hemisphere. Although the ionization rate changes over a solar cycle, this has little bearing on the winter anomaly as the latter depends on the relative difference in the ionization rate between the winter and summer hemispheres. The variations of this balance between the zenith angle and composition with solar cycle are described here. This relationship also produces the quasi-equinoctial peaks in NmF2. The possibility that these changes in neutral composition may affect the annual anomaly will also be considered as will the vertical variation of composition. Finally, some implications of these changes in the winter anomaly over a solar cycle are explored.",

            "abstract": "Instrumental and proxy data and global climate model experiments indicate a multi-decadal shoaling of the western tropical Pacific (WTP) thermocline potentially related to a shift in ENSO frequency. In the WTP, the nutricline coincides with the thermocline, and a shoaling of the nutricline brings more nitrate-rich seawater higher in the water column and within the sunlit euphotic zone. In the nutrient-poor WTP, this incursion of nitrate-rich water at the bottom of the euphotic zone may stimulate productivity in the water column. However, there is a general paucity of measurements below the surface with which to investigate recent changes in seawater chemistry. Nitrogen isotope (δ15N) measurements of particulate organic matter (POM) can elucidate the source of nitrogen to the WTP and related trophic dynamics. This POM is the food source to the long-lived proteinaceous corals, and drives the nitrogen isotopic composition of their skeleton. Here, we report time series δ15N values from the banded skeletons of proteinaceous corals from offshore Palau in the WTP that provide proxy information about past changes in euphotic zone nitrogen dynamics. Bulk skeletal δ15N values declined between 1977 and 2010 suggesting a progressively increasing contribution of deep water with isotopically-light nitrate to the euphotic zone and/or a shortening of the planktonic food web. Since only some amino acids are enriched in δ15N with each trophic transfer in a food web, we measured the δ15N composition of seven individual amino acids in the same coral skeleton. The δ15N time series of the individual amino acids also declined over time, mirroring the bulk values. These new data indicate that the changes in the source nitrogen to the base of the euphotic zone drives a decline in coral skeletal δ15N values, consistent with the shoaling nutricline, with no coinciding alteration of the trophic structure in the WTP.",

            "abstract": "29 July 2014\nAtmospheric Rivers (AR’s) play a dominant role in variability of precipitation on the US W. Coast. A major AR study field effort with three research aircraft and the ship RV Ron Brown are committed to a campaign in January–February 2015. In this paper we report on an ”early-start” deployment of the NOAA G-IV aircraft, which was conducted in February 2014 to test new flight modules and to work out key logistical and flight operations methods. In February 2014 the NOAA G-IV research aircraft sampled 10 ARs over the northeast Pacific Ocean. On five of these flights (Feb 08, 11, 13, 18, 21) dropsondes were deployed in a line crossing the AR so as to robustly sample the atmospheric structure. The sonde profiles yield gradients of wind speed, potential temperature, and water vapor mixing ratio in the surface layer over the ocean. Surface fluxes can be estimated from these gradients. If sea surface temperature (SST) is available, fluxes can also be computed using a bulk-flux algorithm. Conventional atmospheric sondes do not measure SST, but we developed a method to estimate SST by extrapolating the gradient to the surface. This was effective for temperature and water vapor profiles. A short iteration yielded reasonable estimates of SST and fluxes of momentum, sensible, and latent heat. The SST values were compared to satellite values. Five different satellite products were used: microwave, AMSR, wsat, TMI, and MODIS. A single satellite estimate was created as the median of these five. Standard deviation (std) of the five satellite estimates at each location is about 0.5 C. A grand comparison of satellite and sonde SST estimates for the five flights was made. For a total of 119 locations, the mean of Sonde-Satellite SST is about -0.02 C (std 0.76 C, correlation coefficient 0.983). For SST deduced from the humidity profile, the mean difference is 0.20 C (std 1.26, correlation 0.953). Surface fluxes were surprisingly small: sensible heat flux was typically negative and latent heat flux positive or negative. This implies that the bottom of the AR loses some heat to the surface and gains water vapor only modestly as it goes from the tropics to the W. Coast.",

            "abstract": "Amplitude variation with offset (AVO) is a technique in exploration seismology that uses active-source seismic reflection amplitudes to estimate subsurface elastic parameters. Because it measures an interface property, AVO has higher resolution than transmission-based methods such as S-wave splitting and Velocity Variation with Azimuth (VVAZ), and is therefore preferred. Using the azimuthal AVO response, anisotropic elastic parameters can be estimated, providing information such as fast and slow elastic wave velocities from which dominant fracture/stress orientations can be inferred. AVO methods typically separate the effects of elastic parameters on the reflection coefficient into three terms based on the incidence angles they dominate: intercept (small angles), gradient (mid-sized angles), and curvature (large angles). The gradient is characterized by multiple independent elastic stiffness coefficients that change with azimuth, leading to nonuniqueness and a 90 degree ambiguity in the estimated anisotropy orientation. We point out that within a particular parameterization, the curvature term is only influenced by a single term proportional to the change in the squared horizontal P-wave velocity across the interface along a given azimuth. The simplicity of the curvature term provides the capability of determining anisotropy orientation without ambiguity, especially when combined with the gradient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the curvature as a constraint on anisotropy orientation using physical modeling data of a simulated fractured medium from Mahmoudian (2013). We show that the curvature removes the 90 degree ambiguity in fracture orientation that would be present from only using the gradient.",

            "abstract": "Planetary-scale magnetic fields are a window to a planet's interior and provide shielding of the planet's atmosphere. The Earth, Mercury, Ganymede, and the giant planets of the solar system all contain internal dynamo currents that generate planetary-scale magnetic fields. These internal dynamo currents arise from differential rotation, convection, compositional dynamics, or a combination of these. If coupled to an energy source, such as the incident kinetic or magnetic energy from the solar wind, a planet's magnetic field can produce electron cyclotron masers in its magnetic polar regions. The most well known example of this process is the Jovian decametric emission, but all of the giant planets and the Earth contain similar electron cyclotron masers within their magnetospheres. Extrapolated to extrasolar planets, the remote detection of the magnetic field of an extrasolar planet would provide a means of obtaining constraints on the thermal state, composition, and dynamics of its interior as well as improved understanding of the basic planetary dynamo process.\nThe magnetospheric emissions from solar system planets and the discovery of extrasolar planets have motivated both theoretical and observational work on magnetospheric emissions from extrasolar planets. Stimulated by these advances, the W.M. Keck Institute for Space Studies hosted a workshop entitled \"Planetary Magnetic Fields: Planetary Interiors and Habitability.\" I summarize the current observational status of searches for magnetospheric emissions from extrasolar planets, based on observations from a number of ground-based radio telescopes, and future prospects for ground-based studies. Using the solar system planetary magnetic fields as a guide, future space-based missions will be required to study planets with magnetic field strengths lower than that of Jupiter. I summarize mission concepts identified in the KISS workshop, with a focus on the detection of planetary electron cyclotron maser emission.\nThe authors acknowledge ideas and advice from the participants in the \"Planetary Magnetic Fields: Planetary Interiors and Habitability\" workshop organized by the Keck Institute for Space Studies. Part of this research was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with NASA.",

            "abstract": "Indo-Atlantic plate kinematics during the Late Cretaceous and early Cenozoic were characterized by two distinctive events: a period of unusually rapid motion of India starting around 70 Ma and lasting until roughly 50 Ma, and a large slowdown of Africa also starting around 70 Ma and also lasting roughly 20 Ma. The synchroneity of India’s fastest motion (66 to 63 Ma) with the maximum outpouring of Deccan flood basalts has been noted by many, leading some to conclude that the speedup was caused by the arrival of the Reunion plume head at the Earth’s surface. The slowdown of Africa starting at 70 Ma has not received as much attention, but the near synchroneity of this event with India’s speedup is striking and suggests that it too may have been driven by the Reunion plume head. Establishing the connection between the changes in motion of India and Africa remains an outstanding problem. Cande and Stegman (2011) showed that an analysis of Africa’s motion in which the stage poles constraining the relative motion of North America-Africa, South America-Africa and Antarctica-Africa are treated as velocity vectors reveal important aspects of Africa’s motion that had not previously been noticed. Specifically they showed that Africa had a distinctive pivoting motion that started at the same time that India started to speed up. Here I use recently revised Antarctic-Africa stage poles to re-examine the pivoting motion of Africa. These rotations show that there were two distinctive events in Africa’s motion. There was an initial, large slowdown (decrease in the rate of counterclockwise rotation) of Africa about a pivot point in the North Atlantic around 71 Ma, about the time India starts to speed up. This initial slowing was followed by a second event in which the change in motion was a gradual but prolonged increase in the rate of Africa’s clockwise rotation about a pivot point in the South Atlantic that lasted from 68 Ma until 53 Ma, the period of the most rapid motion of India. The same two events are seen in the absolute motion of Africa. The initial slowing at 71 Ma may be an early response to the Reunion plume head. The distinctive character of Africa’s pivoting motion during the second stage suggests that it may be related to a ridge push driving force.",

            "abstract": "The Middle East region has been considered to be responsible for approximately 25% of the Earth’s global emissions of dust particles. By developing Middle East Dust Index (MEDI) and applying to 70 dust storms characterized on MODIS images and occurred during the period between 2001 and 2012, we herein present a new high resolution mapping of major atmospheric dust source points participating in this region. To assist environmental managers and decision maker in taking proper and prioritized measures, we then categorize identified sources in terms of intensity based on extracted indices for Deep Blue algorithm and also utilize frequency of occurrence approach to find the sensitive sources. In next step, by implementing the spectral mixture analysis on the Landsat TM images (1984 and 2012), a novel desertification map will be presented. The aim is to understand how human perturbations and land-use change have influenced the dust storm points in the region. Preliminary results of this study indicate for the first time that c.a., 39 % of all detected source points are located in this newly anthropogenically desertified area. A large number of low frequency sources are located within or close to the newly desertified areas. These severely desertified regions require immediate concern at a global scale. During next 6 months, further research will be performed to confirm these preliminary results.",

An initial relatively isotropic spectrum of long-wavelength whistler mode fluctuations is imposed upon the system. The simulations follow the temporal evolution of the field fluctuations as they decay via a forward cascade into a broadband, turbulent spectrum at shorter wavelengths with an anisotropy in the sense of stronger fluctuation energy at k||, where the subscripts denote directions relative to the background magnetic field. As in previous whistler turbulence PIC simulations, electrons are heated with T||e >> Tperp,e.  Consistent with the results of Saito and Nariyuki (2014) the ions are also heated, although more weakly than the electrons and with Tperp,i >> T||i. Larger simulation box sizes enable longer wavelength turbulence and lead to comparatively greater ion heating.

            "abstract": "Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) are long, narrow, intense, and evolving filamentary structures responsible for transporting significant amounts of moisture from the tropics to mid-latitudes and are often associated with extreme winter-time precipitation for regions such as the West Coast of the United States. The Community Earth System Model (CESM) captures these synoptic scale structures as well as their extreme precipitation. The CESM version employed utilizes high resolution atmosphere/land components (0.5o) coupled to the standard (1o) ocean/ice components. The high resolution atmosphere is able to more accurately represent extreme, regional precipitation.\nCataloguing AR events in long-term climate simulations where centuries of data are produced requires an automated AR-identification algorithm that captures the spatial and temporal structures of these events. These algorithms may vary in complexity but all necessitate the inclusion of water vapor content thresholds. The adoption of observationally based empirical threshold values may not translate well to future climate projections as increased temperatures change the background water vapor content (Clausius-Clapeyron relationship).\nHere, we evaluate spatial and temporal characteristics of Western U.S. ARs in CESM and compare them to observations. A variety of threshold definitions will be discussed which span observationally based values of water vapor content to values relative to the background state (more appropriate for future climate). Model simulated extreme precipitation related to AR’s and results from the RCP8.5 future climate scenario will be shown.",

            "abstract": "Extensive field studies indicate that exposed crustal-level magma chambers generate contact metamorphic aureoles in a variety of widths, from a few centimeters to upwards of a kilometer. To examine the large variation in metamorphic signatures, we modeled an instantaneously emplaced magma chamber at various depths in dry, compositionally representative carbonate and silicic crusts. The chamber contained magmas of rhyolitic, andesitic, dacitic, and basaltic composition, and cooling was modeled in prolate, spherical, and sill-like geometries. This combination created a time series of crustal temperature (T) and pressure (P) conditions driven by conductive cooling of the magma chamber. The spatial P-T relations were overlain with representative metapelitic and calcareous P-T pseudosections. Our results indicate that magma chambers will exhibit thinner aureoles with increasing depth of emplacement, due to the higher initial crustal temperature from the geothermal gradient. In addition, sill-like and prolate magma chambers exhibit significant variation in aureole thickness, with contacts on their outermost ends generating thin aureoles while contacts closer to their centers generate very thick aureoles. These results indicate that magma intrusion geometry plays a dominant role in controlling the local impacts of contact metamorphism. While future models will investigate the more complex thermodynamic effects of hydrated crusts, current results demonstrate that the combination of relatively simple geothermal models with petrologic datasets can generate predictions for the maximum metamorphic grade and geometry of magma chamber aureoles.",

Despite its predominantly rural nature, the Upper Peninsula has a history of industrial\nPCB use. PCB congener concentrations in fish vary 50-fold in Upper Peninsula lakes. Several factors may\ncontribute to this high variability including local point sources, unique watershed and lake\ncharacteristics, and food web structure. It was hypothesized that the variability in congener distributions\ncould be used to identify factors controlling concentrations in fish, and then to use those factors to\npredict PCB contamination in fish from lakes that had not been monitored. Watershed and lake\ncharacteristics were acquired from several databases for 16 lakes sampled in the State’s fish\ncontaminant survey. Species congener distributions were compared using Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA) to distinguish between lakes with local vs. regional, atmospheric sources; six lakes were predicted\nto have local sources and half of those have confirmed local PCB use. For lakes without local PCB\nsources, PCA indicated that lake size was the primary factor influencing PCB concentrations. The EPA’s\nbioaccumulation model, BASS, was used to predict PCB contamination in lakes without local sources as a\nfunction of food web characteristics. The model was used to evaluate the hypothesis that deep,\noligotrophic lakes have longer food webs and higher PCB concentrations in top predator fish. Based on\nthese findings, we will develop a mechanistic watershed-lake model to predict PCB concentrations in\nfish as a function of atmospheric PCB concentrations, lake size, and trophic state. Future atmospheric\nconcentrations, predicted by modeling potential primary and secondary emission scenarios, will be used\nto predict the time horizon for safe fish consumption.",

In a first follow-up campaign new aurora images were taken by HST early in 2014 with Europa near apocenter, but the initial detection was not confirmed. More HST aurora images will be obtained in the course of a larger Hubble observing campaign starting in November 2014. We will review all HST aurora imaging observations to date and discuss potential sources for varying plume activity and changing detectability by HST.

The field is only 580-900 m deep and located in the Permian Tubb sandstone that unconformably overlies the granitic basement. Sathaye et al. (2014) estimated that 1.3 Gt of CO2 is stored at the reservoir. A major increase in the pore pressure relative to the hydrostatic pressure is expected due to the large amount of CO2 injected into the reservoir. However, the pre-production gas pressures indicate that most parts of the reservoir are approximately 5 MPa below hydrostatic pressure. Three processes could explain the under pressure in the Bravo Dome reservoir; 1) erosional unloading, 2) CO2 dissolution into the ambient brine, 3) cooling of CO2after injection.\nAnalytical solutions suggest that an erosion rate of 180 m/Ma is required to reduce the pore pressures to the values observed at Bravo Dome. Given that the current erosion rate is only 5 m/Ma (Nereson et al. 2013); the sub-hydrostatic pressures at Bravo Dome are likely due to CO2dissolution and cooling.\nTo investigate the impact of CO2 dissolution on the pore pressure we have developed new analytical solutions and conducted laboratory experiments. We assume that gaseous CO2 was confined to sandstones during emplacement due to the high entry pressure of the siltstones. After emplacement the CO2 dissolves in to the brine contained in the siltstones and the pressure in the sandstones declines. Assuming the sandstone-siltstone system is closed, the pressure decline due to CO2 dissolution is controlled by a single dimensionless number, η = KHRTVw /Vg. Herein, KH is Henry’s constant, R is ideal gas constant, T is temperature, Vw is water volume, and Vg is CO2 volume. The pressure drop is controlled by the ratio of water volume to CO2 volume and η varies between 0.1 to 8 at Bravo Dome. This corresponds to pressure drops between 0.8-7.5 MPa and can therefore account for the observed 5 MPa drop in pore pressures at Bravo Dome. This is consistent with geochemical observation suggesting significant dissolution of CO2 at Bravo Dome (Gilfillan 2009). The observation of sub-hydrostatic pressures in CO2 reservoirs is important because they illustrate that CO2 dissolution may mitigate problems due to injection induced overpressure in the long-term.",

Tracking and monitoring air quality provides individuals with the knowledge to make personal decisions about their health and investigate the environment in which they live. Satellite remote sensing and ground-based observations (e.g. Environmental Protection Agency, NASA Aerosol Robotic Network) of air quality is spatially and temporarlly limited and often neglects to provide individuals with the freedom to understand their own personal environment using their personal observations. Given the ubiquitous nature of smartphones, individuals have access to powerful processing and sensing capabilities. When coupled with the appropriate sensor parameters, filters, and algorithms, smartphones can be used both for ‘citizen science’ air quality applications and ‘professional’ scientific atmospheric investigations, alike, simplifying data analysis, processing, and improving deployment efficiency.

Global models that start in the corona (or below) are driven by representations of the full-Sun photospheric magnetic field. Traditionally, the full-Sun magnetic field has been provided by synoptic magnetograms, which are created over a 28 day period and are not an accurate representation of the magnetic field at any given time. Recently, several groups have been producing so-called ``synchronic maps,’’ which fuse magnetograms and models including differential rotation, meridional transport and diffusion to create time-dependent full-Sun magnetic field maps. Here, we include a variety of synchronic and synoptic maps to create an ensemble space weather model and report on the results.",

The highly successful program, \"Integrated Geospatial Education and Technology Training–Remote Sensing (iGETT-RS)\" will complete its currently funded work in May 2015. 76 instructors of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) from all over the country will have been served. Each of them will have spent 18 months on the project, participating in two Summer Institutes at NASA and USGS and in monthly webinars on science and technology of remote sensing. iGETT-RS participants have created their own exercises and \"concept modules\" for the classroom, and many have created new courses and new programs across the country. As the external evaluator for iGETT-RS expressed it, the impact on project participants can \"only be described as transformational.\"\nViewers of this presentation will learn about the iGETT-RS project design and approach; successes, failures and lessons learned by the staff; and how to access the workshop materials and participant-authored classroom resources. Viewers will also learn about the Geospatial Technology Competency Model at the US Department of Labor, and about specifications for the Remote Sensing Model Course recently developed by the National Geospatial Technology Center to provide invaluable frameworks for faculty, students, administrators and employers.",

            "abstract": "It has been known for decades that at wavelengths L-band or longer, SAR is a sensitive indicator of inundation underneath forest canopies. The high resolution detection of below-canopy inundation is difficult to accomplish at regional to continental scales using other types of remote sensing sensors, making it a compelling SAR measurement especially useful for studying wetland inundation dynamics, particularly in difficult-to-reach access, canopy-covered tropical forest environments. Most results have utilized spaceborne SAR observations with less than fully polarimetric data. Since one of the objectives of the NISAR mission is to characterize and understand the fundamental process that drives changes to ecosystems such as wetland inundated areas, we will discuss the sensitivity of L-band SAR to inundation.\nWe will illustrate the detection of inundation using fully polarimetric L-band SAR data from UAVSAR, NASA’s airborne SAR, over a tropical forest region in Ecuador and Peru. At the same time as the data collection, measurements were made on the ground to characterize vegetation and inundation characteristics. The field data were used to validate the results of classifying the vanZyl decomposition of the polarimetric data. We compare this classification with that possible with a reduced subset of the polarimetric observations.",

Here, field observations are combined with hydrodynamic modeling to determine the dominant processes that lead rip currents to turn on and off with changing waves, bathymetry, and tidal elevation. Waves, currents, mean sea levels, and bathymetry were measured near and within five shore-perpendicular channels (on average 2-m deep, 30-m wide) that were dredged with the propellers of a landing craft at different times on a long straight Atlantic Ocean beach near Duck, NC in summer 2012. The circulation was measured for a range of incident wave conditions and channel sizes, and included rapid transitions between strong (0.5 to 1 m/s) rip current jets flowing offshore through the channels and alongshore currents flowing across the channels with no rip currents. Meandering alongshore currents (alongshore currents combined with an offshore jet at the downstream edge of the channel) also were observed. Circulation patterns near and within idealized rip channels simulated with COAWST (a three-dimensional phase-averaged model that couples ROMS and SWAN) are compared with the observations. In addition, the model is used to investigate the hydrodynamic response to a range of wave conditions (angle, height, period) and bathymetries (channel width, depth, and length; tidal elevations; shape of sandbar or terrace). Rip current speeds are largest for the deepest perturbations, and decrease as incident wave angles become more oblique. For obliquely incident waves, the rip currents are shifted in the direction of the alongshore flow, with an increasing shift for increasing alongshore current speed or increasing bathymetric perturbation depth.",

            "abstract": "The long standing notion that plate tectonics is key to planetary habitability is critically evaluated. The purported necessity of plate tectonics for planetary habitability is tied to volatile cycling, atmosphere retention, and carbon burial. Plate tectonics is not unique in allowing for cycling of volatiles between the interior of a planet and its atmosphere. Volcanism can be maintained on a single plate planet over geologic time scales and several non-plate tectonic recycling mechanisms are viable on such a planet. The frequency and efficiency of these modes of volatile recycling and volcanism are critical to evaluating whether they are sufficient to stabilize climate. An episodic mode of a volcanism and subduction also has the potential to provide the level of volatile cycling needed to maintain habitability. We combine solid planet models of degassing and regassing with climate, surface processes, and carbon sequestration models to determine the level to which habitable conditions can be maintained in the absence of plate tectonics. We also review arguments that the Earth operated in a different tectonic mode over its initial 2-3 billion years of geologic evolution, a time period over which the planet was habitable. Collectively our results suggests that habitable conditions can exist independent of the tectonic mode of a planet. However, O-rich atmospheres and complex life might require continuous recycling processes and ocean floor uplift to bury carbon onto stable platforms as provided by plate tectonics.",

            "abstract": "In May 1996, the Buffalo Creek fire burned nearly 5,000 hectares of National Forest and private land 60 miles southwest of Denver, Colorado. Several weeks later, convective storms initiated severe flooding in the Buffalo and Spring Creek watersheds, leading to significant overland and fluvial sediment transport. To assess landscape response to fire, the U.S. Geological Survey monitored hydrologic and sedimentologic conditions between 1997 and 2000. In addition to precipitation, discharge and grain size distribution measurements over the study period, ground surveys and photogrammetry were done at representative cross-sections near the downstream channel outlet to estimate volumes of transported material after different precipitation events. These data can be used to validate numerical models that simulate landscape hydrologic and erosional responses post-fire. Modeling is a critical tool in understanding landscape response to fire across these short time scales, as post-fire erosion events can disrupt steady-state landscapes, subsequently affecting short and long-term landscape evolution. Anthropogenic climate change can exacerbate these morphologic changes over time, as precipitation and fire regimes will experience changes in event recurrence. Landlab, an open-source, componentized model written in Python, can be used to explore landscape evolution across both short and long time scales. The observed hydrologic conditions from Spring Creek are modeled across a 1-meter digital elevation model (DEM) of the watershed to simulate observed flow and sediment transport events. Once the flow and sediment transport data are validated using Landlab components, the model results can be extrapolated to understand landscape response to precipitation and discharge events that occurred immediately post-fire that were not measured in the field. Particularly, sediment transport by overland flow through sheet-flow and rilling are more significant in burned than unburned landscapes and the Landlab post-fire model can be used to quantify these differences. These results shed light on which processes are drivers of post-fire erosional responses in central Colorado, and how those responses can drive morphological changes over much longer time scales, particularly when climate change is considered.",

            "abstract": "Increased photosynthetic activity and enhanced seasonal CO2 exchange of northern ecosystems have been observed from a variety of sources including satellite vegetation indices like NDVI and atmospheric CO2 measurements. Most of these changes have been attributed to strong warming trends in the northern high latitudes (≥50°N). Here we analyze the interannual variation of summer net carbon uptake (NCU) derived from atmospheric CO2 measurements and satellite NDVI in relation to surface meteorology from regional observational records. We find that increases in spring precipitation and snow pack promote summer NCU of northern ecosystems independent of air temperature effects. However, satellite NDVI measurements still show an overall benefit of summer photosynthetic activity from regional warming and limited impact of spring precipitation. We hypothesize this strong sensitivity of NCU to spring hydrology may be caused by a strong regulation of spring hydrology on soil respiration in relatively wet boreal and arctic ecosystems, and the reduced sensitivity of NCU to temperature is likely due to similar responses of photosynthesis and respiration to warming. We use a combination of in-situ tower eddy covariance CO2 flux measurements, satellite soil moisture retrievals, and a process model to test this hypothesis. Our results document the important role of spring hydrology in regulating northern ecosystem carbon uptake, and indicate potentially stronger coupling of boreal/arctic water and carbon cycles with continued regional warming trends.",

Yet there is substantial inter-annual variability (IAV) in the number of days that exceed the O3 air quality threshold (currently 75 ppbv for an 8-hour average). We propose that wildfires are the dominant cause for this IAV. However there are large uncertainties around O3 production from wildfires due to numerous complicating factors. Ozone formation in wildfire plumes differs substantially from urban O3 production in several ways: substantial variations in the emissions, much larger aerosol loadings, a much greater variety of reactive and oxygenated VOCs, rapid and substantial formation of PAN and very different sources of HOx in the plume. These factors make it challenging to model wildfire impacts on photochemistry in the usual way.\nIn this presentation we will show examples of three common situations based on data from the Mt. Bachelor Observatory:\nRapid O3 formation (within one day) in a wildfire plume.\nSlow, but substantial, O3 formation (over days to a week) in a wildfire plume.\nNo detectable O3 formation in a wildfire plume.\nWe will interpret these results with respect to the observed NOy mixing ratios, the photochemical environment, the combustion efficiency, the plume transport and other factors and suggest some key experiments and modeling studies that can help further our understanding of wildfire O3 production.",

            "abstract": "Sea level reconstructions have been created using wide variety of proxies and models. The accuracy of individual sea level reconstructions is limited by measurement, noise, local variations in salinity and temperature, and the assumptions particular to each reconstruction. To address these limitations, we have created a sea level stack (average) which increases the signal-to-noise ratio of sea level estimates by combining 5-7 sea level reconstructions over the last 800 kyr. Principal Component analysis (PCA) of seven sea level records from 0-430 kyr ago shows that 82% of the variance in these records is explained by their first principal component (i.e., the stack). Additionally, a stack of just the 5 longer records that extends to 800 kyr closely matches the timing and amplitude of our seven-record mean. We find that the mean sea level estimate for Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e is 0-4 m above modern, and that the standard deviation of individual estimates is 11 m. Mean sea level estimates for MIS 11 are 12-16 m above modern with a standard deviation of 30 m. Due to the large variability between individual reconstructions, our sea level stack may provide more robust sea level estimates than any single technique.",

These electron features were correlated with simultaneously detected emissions of whistler-mode chorus waves [Fennell et al., GRL, 2014]. The apparent width of the peaks in pitch angle was approximately 10° (FWHM), which is comparable to the 10° x 20° field-of-view of the MagEIS sensor. We report the results of a deconvolution procedure to estimate the true angular width of these peaks. MagEIS was in high rate mode during this period so that flux samples were accumulated every ~10 ms, corresponding to an angular cadence of every 0.36°. A maximum entropy method is used to deconvolve the observed distributions and the instrument response function. This technique provides the smoothest possible distribution that is consistent with the data and their statistical properties. The results of this analysis show that the peaks are significantly more narrow than previously reported. We discuss the implications of this narrow angular width for wave-particle interactions.",

            "abstract": "We employ the 3D boundary element code RSQSim with a California fault model, based on the UCERF3 fault model, to generate synthetic catalogs spanning from tens of thousands, up to a million years. The simulations incorporate rate-state fault constitutive properties, and the catalogs include foreshocks, aftershocks and occasional clusters of large events. The large-event clusters, which usually consist of event pairs, but occasionally consist of three or more large events, develop spontaneously on continuous fault segments, but clustering rates are higher in areas of structural complexity. We observe several potential indicators of impending large, secondary events comparable in magnitude to the prior mainshocks. When a large-event cluster occurs, the primary event has an especially productive aftershock sequence, roughly double the normal aftershock rates for non-clustered mainshocks; and the aftershock locations of the primary event in a cluster appear to correlate with the location of the next large event in the cluster. We find that aftershock rate is a proxy for the stress state of the faults. Also, aftershock sequences transition into foreshock sequences, wherein the average event rate increases prior to the impending large event in the cluster. These increased event rates prior to the second event in a cluster follow an inverse Omori’s law, which is characteristic of foreshock sequences in nature. Finally, the aftershock/foreshock locations migrate toward the point of nucleation of the next large event in the cluster. Empirical clustering probabilities based on aftershock rates have better predictive power than those obtained from Omori aftershock and Gutenberg-Richter magnitude frequency laws, which suggests that the high aftershock rates indicate near-critical stresses for failure in a large earthquake.",

            "abstract": "The redox state of mantle-derived magmas is a controversial issue, especially whether island arc basalts are more oxidized than those from mid-ocean ridges. Usually, arc magmas have higher Fe3+/Fe2+ and calculated oxygen fugacity (fO2) than mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB). It is the high fO2 of arc magma that apparently delays onset of sulfide fractionation and sequestration of precious/base metals thereby facilitating the formation of many giant gold-copper deposits typically associated with subduction zones. But due to a paucity of Fe3+/Fe2+ data for primary mantle-derived arc magmas, the cause for high fO2 of these magma types is still controversial; causes may include inter alia subduction-released oxidized material addition to the mantle wedge source of arc magma, partial melting of subducted slab, and redox changes occurring during ascent of the magma. Fortunately, IODP expedition 351 drilling at IODP Site U1438 in the Amami-Sankaku Basin of the northwestern Philipine Sea, adjacent to the proto-Izu-Bonin Arc at the Kyushu-Palau Ridge (KPR), recovered not only volcaniclastics derived from the inception of Izu-Bonin Mariana (IBM) arc in the Eocene, but also similar materials for the Arc’s subsequent evolution through to the Late Oligocene and abandonment of the KPR as a remnant arc. Samples of the pre-Arc oceanic crustal basement were also recovered enabling us to determine the fO2of the mantle preceding arc inception.\nAs the oxidation state of iron in basaltic glass directly relates to the fO2 , the Fe3+/∑Fe ratio [Fe3+/(Fe3++ Fe2+)] of basaltic glass are quantified by synchrotron-facilitated micro X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) spectroscopy to reflect its fO2. Fe K-edge µ-XANES spectra were recorded in fluorescence mode at Beamline 15U1, Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). Synthetic silicate glass with known Fe3+/∑Fe ratio was used in data handling. The experimental results as well as preliminary data from IODP Expedition 351 will be presented",

            "abstract": "Nitrate trends in streams often do not match expectations based on recent nitrogen source loadings to the land surface. Groundwater discharge with long travel times has been suggested as the likely cause for these observations. The fate of nitrate in groundwater depends to a large extent on the occurrence of denitrification along flow paths. Because denitrification in groundwater is inhibited when dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations are high, defining the oxic-suboxic interface has been critical in determining pathways for nitrate transport in groundwater and to streams at the local scale. Predicting redox conditions on a regional scale is complicated by the spatial variability of reaction rates. In this study, logistic regression and boosted classification tree analysis were used to predict the probability of oxic water in groundwater in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The probability of oxic water (DO > 2 mg/L) was predicted by relating DO concentrations in over 3,000 groundwater samples to indicators of residence time and/or electron donor availability. Variables that describe position in the flow system (e.g., depth to top of the open interval), soil drainage and surficial geology were the most important predictors of oxic water. Logistic regression and boosted classification tree analysis correctly predicted the presence or absence of oxic conditions in over 75 % of the samples in both training and validation data sets. Predictions of the percentages of oxic wells in deciles of risk were very accurate (r2>0.9) in both the training and validation data sets. Depth to the bottom of the oxic layer was predicted and is being used to estimate the effect that groundwater denitrification has on stream nitrate concentrations and the time lag between the application of nitrogen at the land surface and its effect on streams.",

            "abstract": "Determination of the nature and degree of hydrologically connected groundwater and surface water resources is of paramount importance to integrated water management within the State of Nebraska to understand the impact of water uses on available supplies, such as depletion of streams and aquifers caused by groundwater pumping. The ability to quantify effects of surface water-groundwater hydrologic connection and interactions, is regarded as one of the most important steps towards effectively managing water resources in Nebraska and provides the basis for designating management areas. Designation of management areas allows the state and other management entities to focus various efforts and resources towards those projects that have the greatest impact to water users. Nebraska Department of Natural Resources (NDNR) developed a groundwater modeling tool, Cycle Well Analysis, to determine the areas defined to have a high degree of connectivity between groundwater and surface water (in accordance with the state regulations). This tool features two graphic user interfaces to allow the analysis to be fully compatible with most MODFLOW-based numerical groundwater models currently utilized by NDNR. Case studies showed that the tool, in combination of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), can be used to quantify the degree of stream depletion and delineate the boundary of hydrologically connected areas within different political boundaries and subbasins in Nebraska. This approach may be applied to other regions with similar background and need for integrated water management.",

The δD value of leaf waxes is known to primarily reflect the δD value of source water, modified by biological fractionations commonly summarized as the ‘net or apparent’ fractionation. It remains a challenge, however, to quantitatively relate the isotopic composition of the end product (wax) back to that of the precursor (water) because multiple isotope effects contributing to the net fractionation are not yet well understood. Transgenic variants have heretofore unexplored potential to isolate individual isotope effects. Here we report the first hydrogen isotopic measurements from transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants with calculations of leaf water enrichment, net and biosynthetic fractionation values from measured δD of plant waters and leaf wax n-alkanes. We employed transgenic Arabidopsis leaves, engineered to have different stomatal density, by differential expression of the stomatal growth hormone stomagen. Comparison of variants and wild types allow us to isolate the effects of stomatal density on leaf water and the net fractionation expressed by leaf wax biomarkers. Results show that transgenic leaves with denser pores have more enriched leaf water and leaf wax δD values than wild type and even more so than transgenic leaves with sparse stomata (difference of 10 ‰). Our findings that stomatal density controls leaf water and leaf wax δD values adds insights into the cause of variations in net fractionations between species, as well as suggesting that geological variations in stomatal density may modulate the sedimentary leaf wax δD record. In nature, stomatal density varies between species and environments, and all other factors being equal, this will contribute to variations in fractionations observed. Over geological history, lower stomatal densities occur at times of elevated pCO2; our findings predict reduced leaf water isotopic enrichment and larger net fractionations during these greenhouse conditions. Future work involving transgenic plants holds considerable potential to isolate additional factors which may influence the net fractionation between source water and leaf waxes adding to our fundamental understanding of this proxy.",

            "abstract": "Stream temperature controls a variety of biological, chemical and physical in-stream processes. A growing body of research has highlighted the importance of advection associated with surface water and groundwater interactions on stream thermal regimes, and considerable effort has focused on the thermal role of hyporheic exchange and groundwater discharge. However, few studies have focused on advection associated with hillslope throughflow inputs. Current catchment-scale coupled hydrology and stream temperature models (DHSVM, SWAT, HSPF, CEQUEAU, MIKE SHE) use a variety of approaches to estimate throughflow temperatures, but none of these approaches has been evaluated against field measurements of throughflow temperature. We monitored throughflow temperature at fifty locations along a headwater stream located in the rain-on-snow zone of the Pacific Northwest. Current approaches to estimate throughflow temperature were evaluated against field observations and were found to under- or over-predict throughflow temperatures by up to 8 °C, or not be able to represent the influence of transient snow cover. Therefore, we developed a conceptual-parametric hydrology and stream temperature model that simulates hillslope throughflow temperatures. The model successfully predicts throughflow temperatures and highlights the dominant role of throughflow advection and the influence of snow cover on stream thermal regimes during high flow periods and rain-on-snow events.",

            "abstract": "It has been suggested that continuing seismicity in the New Madrid, central U.S. region is primarily composed of the continuing long-lived aftershock sequence of the 1811-1812 sequence, and thus cannot be taken as an indication of present-day strain accrual in the region. We examine historical and instrumental seismicity in the New Madrid region to determine if such a model is feasible given 1) the observed protracted nature of past New Madrid sequences, with multiple mainshocks with apparently similar magnitudes; 2) historical rates of M≥6 earthquakes after the initial activity in 1811-1812; and 3) the modern seismicity rate in the region. We use ETAS modeling to search for sub-critical sets of direct Omori parameters that are consistent with all of these datasets, given a realistic consideration of their uncertainties. High aftershock productivity is required both to match the observation of multiple mainshocks and to explain the modern level of activity as aftershocks; synthetic sequences consistent with these observations substantially overpredict the number of events of M≥6 that were observed in the past 200 years. Our results imply that ongoing background seismicity in the New Madrid region is driven by ongoing strain accrual processes and that, despite low deformation rates, seismic activity in the zone is not decaying with time.",

For comparison, the present day Earth value is 0.33. These estimates fly in the face of conventional wisdom that a smaller planet like Mars should have cooled faster than the Earth - and certainly should not be heating up at present. We perform a sensitivity analysis, using a thermal history modeling approach, to asses the relative effects of changing planetary size, mode of tectonics, and nature of deep volatile cycling (focussing on water). Our results indicate that differences in the nature of volatile cycling (degassing vs regassing over time) can outweigh the effects of size and tectonic mode in determining the thermal state of a planet. Mars models in which degassing dominates can give Urey ratios that exceed unity. Earth models in which regassing dominates over degassing in the later geologic stages of evolution lead to lower Urey ratio values.",

These volcanic centers are within the graben of the EARS and are characterized by a shield-building phase followed by caldera collapse and subsequent post-caldera eruptions. Geochemical modeling demonstrates that the magmas are the result of fractional crystallization of alkali basaltic magmas and magma mixing. Longonot and Suswa have the most chronologic data -14 C, Ar/Ar and U-series – and they show that the youngest eruptions have 230 Th/232Th of 0.8, which was inherited from the magma system prior to eruption.

            "abstract": "The standard model for the origin of foreshocks is that they are earthquakes that trigger aftershocks larger than themselves (Reasenberg and Jones, 1989). This can be formally expressed in terms of a cascade model. In this model, aftershock magnitudes follow the Gutenberg-Richter magnitude-frequency distribution, regardless of the size of the triggering earthquake, and aftershock timing and productivity follow Omori-Utsu scaling. An alternative hypothesis is that foreshocks are triggered incidentally by a nucleation process, such as pre-slip, that scales with mainshock size. If this were the case, foreshocks would potentially have predictive power of the mainshock magnitude.\nA number of predictions can be made from the cascade model, including the fraction of earthquakes that are foreshocks to larger events, the distribution of differences between foreshock and mainshock magnitudes, and the distribution of time lags between foreshocks and mainshocks. The last should follow the inverse Omori law, which will cause the appearance of an accelerating seismicity rate if multiple foreshock sequences are stacked (Helmstetter and Sornette, 2003). All of these predictions are consistent with observations (Helmstetter and Sornette, 2003; Felzer et al. 2004).\nIf foreshocks were to scale with mainshock size, this would be strong evidence against the cascade model. Recently, Bouchon et al. (2013) claimed that the expected acceleration in stacked foreshock sequences before interplate earthquakes is higher prior to M≥6.5 mainshocks than smaller mainshocks. Our re-analysis fails to support the statistical significance of their results. In particular, we find that their catalogs are not complete to the level assumed, and their ETAS model underestimates inverse Omori behavior.\nTo conclude, seismicity data to date is consistent with the hypothesis that the nucleation process is the same for earthquakes of all sizes.",

Two prominent MJOs occurred in the experimental domain during the Special Observing Period in October and November. Data from a northern and a southern sounding array (NSA and SSA, respectively) have been used to investigate the apparent heat sources and sinks (Q1 and Q2) and radiative heating rates QR throughout the life cycles of the two MJO events. The MJO signal was far stronger in the NSA than the SSA, so attention is focused on results for the NSA.\nTime series of Q1, Q2, and the vertical eddy flux of moist static energy reveal an evolution of cloud systems for both MJOs consistent with prior studies: shallow, non-precipitating cumulus during the suppressed phase, followed by cumulus congestus, then deep convection during the active phase, and finally stratiform precipitation. However, the duration of these phases was shorter for the November MJO than for the October event. The profiles of Q1 and Q2 for the two arrays indicate a greater stratiform rain fraction for the NSA than the SSA, a finding supported by TRMM measurements.\nSurface rainfall rates and column-integrated QR determined as residuals from the budgets show good agreement with satellite-based estimates. The column-integrated QR anomaly was nearly 20% of the net-tropospheric convective heating anomaly for the October MJO, approaching the proposed condition for radiative-convective instability. The ratio was far less for the November event, further emphasizing important distinctions between the two MJOs.",

            "abstract": "Model Model complexity resulting from the need to integrate environmental system components cannot be understated. In particular, additional emphasis is urgently needed on rational approaches to guide decision making through uncertainties surrounding the integrated system across decision-relevant scales. However, in spite of the difficulties that the consideration of modeling uncertainty represent for the decision process, it should not be avoided or the value and science behind the models will be undermined. These two issues; i.e., the need for coupled models that can answer the pertinent questions and the need for models that do so with sufficient certainty, are the key indicators of a model’s relevance. Model relevance is inextricably linked with model complexity. Although model complexity has advanced greatly in recent years there has been little work to rigorously characterize the threshold of relevance in integrated and complex models. Formally assessing the relevance of the model in the face of increasing complexity would be valuable because there is growing unease among developers and users of complex models about the cumulative effects of various sources of uncertainty on model outputs. In particular, this issue has prompted doubt over whether the considerable effort going into further elaborating complex models will in fact yield the expected payback. New approaches have been proposed recently to evaluate the uncertainty-complexity-relevance modeling trilemma (Muller, Muñoz-Carpena and Kiker, 2011) by incorporating state-of-the-art global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis (GSA/UA) in every step of the model development so as to quantify not only the uncertainty introduced by the addition of new environmental components, but the effect that these new components have over existing components (interactions, non-linear responses). Outputs from the analysis can also be used to quantify system resilience (stability, alternative states, thresholds or tipping points) in the face of environmental and anthropogenic change (Perz, Muñoz-Carpena, Kiker and Holt, 2013), and through MonteCarlo mapping potential management activities over the most important factors or processes to influence the system towards behavioral (desirable) outcomes (Chu-Agor, Muñoz-Carpena et al., 2012).",

            "abstract": "Every 6 years, the USGS updates the National Seismic Hazard Maps (new version released July 2014) that are intended to help society reduce risk from earthquakes. These maps affect hundreds of billions of dollars in construction costs each year as they are used to develop seismic-design criteria of buildings, bridges, highways, railroads, and provide data for risk assessment that help determine insurance rates. Seismic source characterization, an essential component of hazard model development, ranges from detailed trench excavations across faults at the ground surface to less detailed analysis of broad regions defined mainly on the basis of historical seismicity. Though it is a priority for the USGS to discover new Quaternary fault sources, the discovered faults only become a part of the hazard model if there are corresponding constraints on their geometry (length and depth extent) and slip-rate (or recurrence interval). When combined with fault geometry and slip-rate constraints, near-surface seismic studies that detect young (Quaternary) faults have become important parts of the hazard source model. Examples of seismic imaging studies with significant hazard impact include the Southern Whidbey Island fault, Washington; Santa Monica fault, San Andreas fault, and Palos Verdes fault zone, California; and Commerce fault, Missouri. There are many more faults in the hazard model in the western U.S. than in the expansive region east of the Rocky Mountains due to the higher rate of tectonic deformation, frequent surface-rupturing earthquakes and, in some cases, lower erosion rates. However, the recent increase in earthquakes in the central U.S. has revealed previously unknown faults for which we need additional constraints before we can include them in the seismic hazard maps. Some of these new faults may be opportunities for seismic imaging studies to provide basic data on location, dip, style of faulting, and recurrence.",

            "abstract": "A new relationship between the surface distribution of equivalent potential temperature and the potential temperature at the tropopause is proposed. Using a Gaussian approximation for the distribution of equivalent potential temperature, we argue that the tropopause potential temperature is approximately given by the mean equivalent potential temperature at the surface plus twice its standard derivation. This relationship is motivated by the comparison of the meridional circulation on dry and moist isentropes. It is further tested using four reanalysis datasets: the Interim ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim); the NCEP–Department of Energy (DOE) Reanalysis II; the NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis; and the Twentieth-Century Reanalysis (20CR), version 2. The proposed relationship successfully captures the annual cycle of the tropopause for both hemispheres. The results are robust among different reanalysis datasets, albeit the 20CR tends to overestimate the tropopause potential temperature. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism also works well in obtaining the inter-annual variability (with climatological annual cycle removed) for Northern Hemisphere summer with an above 0.6 correlation across different reanalyses. On the contrary, this mechanism is rather weak in explaining the interannual variability in the Southern Hemisphere and no longer works for Northern Hemisphere wintertime. This work suggests the important role of the moist dynamics in determining the midlatitude tropopause. In order to better understand the dynamical mechanisms, we make use of an idealized aquaplanet model simulation with a prescribed subtropical planetary-scale wave sea surface temperature perturbation, which mimics the land-ocean heating asymmetry. A similar dynamical connection is also found in this idealized model experiment, which reveals possible mechanisms related to the Asian monsoon and subtropical anticyclones. Finally, the representation of the dynamical relationship in CMIP5 models will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The tropical Indonesian seas play a central role in the climate system. They lie at the climatological center of the atmospheric deep convection associated with the ascending branch of the Walker Circulation. They also provide an oceanic pathway for the Pacific and Indian inter-ocean exchange, known as the Indonesian throughflow (ITF). The ITF is the only tropical pathway in the global thermohaline circulation. As such, the volume of heat and fresh water carried by the ITF is known to impact the state of the Pacific and Indian oceans as well as air–sea exchange, which modulates the climate system on a variety of timescales. Still, many fundamental questions about the structure and variability of the ITF on climate time scales remain unanswered. Longer time series are needed to understand the links of the vertical ITF transport profile to the IOD and ENSO phenomena and decadal variability, and their implications for climate variations, such as known impacts on precipitation in the Australasian region. This talk will highlight some recent scientific studies of the maritime Indonesian continent, and also discuss a co-ordinated international observational and modeling effort targeted towards identifying the urgent gaps that would lead to an improved understanding of the ITF variability. The ultimate goal of this ITF-Task Team is to provide a scientific basis for developing and evaluating a cost-effective strategy for sustained monitoring of the ITF heat and mass transport over the long term for use in climate models and future predictions.",

            "abstract": "Cirrus clouds, covering ~30% of the Earth, play important roles in Earth’s climate and weather. As a major uncertainty in climate models, cirrus clouds’ radiative forcing (cooling or warming) is influenced by both the microphysical properties (such as ice crystal concentration and size) and the larger scale structure (such as horizontal and vertical extent).\nRecent studies (Diao et al. 2013; Diao et al. 2014), based on in situ observations with ~200 m horizontal resolution, showed that the initial conditions of cirrus formation - ice supersaturated regions (ISSRs, where ISS is spatially continuous) - occur mostly at horizontal scales around 1 km, in contrast to the ~100 km scales by previous observations (Gierens et al. 2000). Yet it is still unknown whether current cloud resolving models can capture these small-scale ISSR features.\nIn this work, we compare the observed characteristics of the ice supersaturation (ISS) with an idealized, cloud-resolving simulation of a squall line (Bryan and Morrison, 2012). The model (CM1) was run with 250 m grid spacing using a double-moment microphysics scheme (Morrison et al. 2005). Our comparisons show that the CM1 model has captured the majority of the small-scale ISSRs (~1 km). In addition, the simulated ISSRs are dominated by water vapor horizontal heterogeneities (~90%) as opposed to temperature heterogeneities (~10%). This result is comparable to the observed values of ~88% and ~9%, respectively. However, when comparing the evolution phases of cirrus clouds (clear-sky ISS, nucleation/freezing, growth and sedimentation/sublimation; Diao et al. 2013), the CM1 simulation does not have sufficient amount of ISS in clear-sky and nucleation phases. This disagreement indicates a shortcoming of the idealized model setup. Overall, the observations show more ISS at higher magnitude (up to ~150% of RHi) than CM1 (~up to 130% of RHi). Also the largest ISSRs in the observations are up to ~100 km, compared with those in CM1 of up to ~10 km. These results suggest possible changes for future modeling studies.",

            "abstract": "From energy budget considerations, the release of latent heat in the atmosphere can be linked directly to the difference between the net radiative balance at the top-of-the-atmosphere and at the surface. This link provides a useful framework for understanding and comparing changes in the hydrological cycle resulting from different types of climate forcings: greenhouse gases, aerosols, or a combination of the two, as in Solar Radiation Modification.\nWe have investigated the influence of geoengineering via cirrus cloud thinning on the atmospheric energy budget and the hydrological cycle in a global climate model. The objective of cirrus cloud thinning is to enhance the outgoing longwave radiation from Earth, thereby cooling the climate. As justified in recent studies, we use ice crystal fall speed enhancement or ice crystal size increase as simple proxies for the full physics of the problem which involves complex microphysics.\nDuring the first simulation year, the changes between the engineered and the control climate are distinctly determined by the nature of the forcing. In this time period, we find that cirrus cloud thinning reduces the TOA radiative balance by 1-2 W m-2, while it enhances the surface radiative balance, which in combination leads to a ~2 W m-2 increase in turbulent fluxes from the surface to the atmosphere, ¾ of that coming from latent heat release. This leads to a ~1% global enhancement of precipitation.\nThe longer term climatological mean gives different results, dominated by the response of the climate system to the cooling implied by cirrus cloud thinning. Due to a cancellation of the influence of the cooling and the initial enhancement of the hydrological cycle, the precipitation is almost unchanged in the engineered climate compared to the control climate, despite the 1-2 K cooling that is achieved. Hence, we conclude that cirrus cloud thinning – as opposed to Solar Radiation Management techniques – enhances the global hydrological cycle.",

            "abstract": "The maximum-pressure P-T conditions (Pmax-T) of exhumed subduction-related metamorphic rocks are compared to estimates of P-T conditions predicted by computational thermal models of subduction systems. While the range of proposed models encompasses most Pmax-T, most models are 200-400°C too cold. In general, discrepancies are greatest for Pmax < 2 GPa where only a few of the highest-T modeled paths overlap petrologic observations. Comparison among published models suggests several possible explanations for these differences. Variables that affect temperatures within the subduction zone include the timing of subduction initiation relative to metamorphism, age of the subducting oceanic crust, rate of convergence, and the dip angle of the subducting plate. An additional factor is whether subducted material is constrained to move coherently with the incoming plate or whether it convects within the plate interface. Higher temperatures are predicted for relatively young subducting crust, slow convergence rates, and shallow subduction dips. Simulations in which material from the subducted slab decouples from the slab and rises buoyantly into an overlying weak layer (e.g. hydrated mantle) also result in higher temperatures for exhumed oceanic crust. Our compilation and comparison suggest either that most models are missing one or more important controls on heat sources and heat transfer or that exhumed blueschists and eclogites are more buoyant than typical subducted rocks.",

            "abstract": "The ability to reconstruct historical climate is important to understanding how climate has changed in the past. The instrumental record of temperature and precipitation only spans the most recent centuries. Thus, reconstructions of the climate features are typically based on proxy archives. The proxy archives integrate climate information through biological, geological, physical, and chemical processes. Tree ring widths provide one of the most spatially and temporally rich sources of high quality climate proxy data. However, the statistical reconstruction of paleoclimate from tree ring widths is quite challenging because the climate signal is inherently multi-dimensional while tree ring widths are a one dimensional data source.\nWe propose a Bayesian Hierarchical model using a non-linear, scientifically motivated tree ring growth models to reconstruct multivariate climate (i.e., temperature and precipitation) in the Hudson Valley region of New York. Our proposed model extends and enhances former methods in a number of ways. We allow for species-specific responses to climate, which further constrains the many-to-one relationship between tree rings and climate. The resulting model allows for prediction of reasonable climate scenarios given tree ring widths. We explore a natural model selection framework that weighs the influence of multiple candidate growth models in terms of their predictive ability. To enable prediction backcasts, the climate variables are modeled with an underlying continuous time latent process. The continuous time process allows for added flexibility in the climate response through time at different temporal scales and enables investigation of differences in climate between the reconstruction period and the instrumental period. Validation of the model's predictive abilities is achieved through a pseudo-proxy simulation experiment where the quality of climate predictions are measured by out of sample performance based on a proper local scoring rule. By accounting for species specific repsonses to climate and adding flexibility in predictions through a continuous time process, we achieve a scientifically motivated reconstruction of paleoclimate from tree ring widths with associated uncertainties that furthers the understanding of historical climate change.",

            "abstract": "Comprehensive climate impacts assessments are important vehicles for conveying salient information to the public and policy makers. However, over the last few decades communication of this important information has been hampered for a number of reasons. Firstly, we have a rapidly changing social media landscape, where there are fewer opportunities for in-depth treatment of issues. To compete in this arena, climate information needs to be packaged in sound bites, and much of the nuance and complexity may be lost. Secondly, scientific literacy among the general U.S. population is not particularly high, which creates a barrier to understanding and limits the audiences that can be reached. Thirdly, climate science has been undermined by misinformation over many years often funded by fossil fuel interests. While this latter obstacle is clearly diminishing - largely in the face of evidence from the undeniable climate impacts that are already being seen by communities - there has been much confusion generated to date.\nDespite the fact that 97% of active climate scientists agree that the planet is warming as a result of human greenhouse gas emission, only 42% of the U.S. population agrees (Pew Research, 2013).\nIn the face of these challenges, much of the work that the Union of Concerned Scientists does to translate climate impacts assessments has shifted to visuals, animations, and videos that people can relate to and connect with more readily. In this session we will share some of the general design features, discuss target audiences, and outline production limitations of several local stories involving videos and animations, as well as present some recent infographics. One example of this work are case studies that focus on sea level rise and involve a local personality who can speak to climate impacts at the community level. We understand the power of visual images and stories in creating messages that stick, and we use this in designing animations that explain the technical findings of climate impacts assessments. We aim to provide the public and policy makers with accessible information to encourage responsible choices regarding both mitigation and adaptation choices to deal with climate change.\nAll of our material is freely available for use from our website - www.ucsusa.org.",

            "abstract": "To improve our understanding of processes occurring in the mantle wedge near the downdip limit of seismicity in subduction zones, we conducted triaxial friction tests on dunite gouge at temperatures in the range 200-350°C, 50 MPa fluid pressure and 100 MPa effective normal stress. Dunite, quartzite, and granite forcing blocks were used respectively to approximate changing rock/fluid chemistry with decreasing distance above the subduction thrust. All experiments were characterized by an initial increase in frictional strength to a peak value, followed by a decrease associated with shearing-enhanced alteration of the dunite gouge. Reaction products and the extent of weakening varied with the chemical environment. In the dunite-block experiments, strength gradually declined from the peak value to a coefficient of friction, µ ~ 0.5–0.6, consistent with the frictional strength of serpentine that formed on the shear surfaces from alteration of the gouge. Interaction of dunite gouge with quartzite and granite driving blocks resulted in significantly greater weakening, to µ ~ 0.3, at temperatures of 250°C and higher. Talc and serpentine partly replaced dunite gouge sheared between quartzite blocks, and metastable saponitic smectite clays crystallized in dunite sheared between granite blocks, as a result of fluid-assisted chemical exchange with the minerals in the wall rocks. These results suggest that rapid and substantial weakening can occur in the mantle wedge immediately overlying the subducting slab. Whichever the chemical environment, attainment of peak strength typically was accompanied by oscillatory slip with small stress drops that gradually was replaced by stable slip with increasing displacement.

            "abstract": "The B/Ca ratio of fossil planktic foraminiferal calcite, a proxy for surface ocean carbonate chemistry, holds promise for reconstructing carbonate system changes due to ocean acidification across the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) at 56 Ma. However, uncertainties in how the proxy behaved under Paleogene seawater chemistry (low [B], low [Mg], high [Ca]) limit the application of modern calibrations during this critical period.\nTo extend the application of the B/Ca proxy to the PETM, we have undertaken culturing experiments with the symbiotic planktic foraminifer Orbulina universa and simulated changes in pH and total DIC appropriate to Paleogene seawater conditions. In addition, we have further investigated the effects of variable [B]seawater(SW) on the proxy. Results confirm previous findings that boron incorporation into the calcite test decreases with increasing DIC, decreasing pH, and decreasing [B]SW [1]. However, B/Ca values in Paleogene experiments are elevated above values predicted from boron concentration experiments at low [B]SW. This may be due to elevated [Ca]SW, which has been shown to raise B/Ca in inorganic precipitate experiments [2], and must be further investigated as [Ca]SWhas varied significantly over geological time [3].\nMost importantly, the proxy appears to be more sensitive to changes in pH under Paleogene conditions than in modern seawater, which helps to explain the large B/Ca decrease observed over the PETM [4]. However, assuming a pH drop from 7.8 to 7.53 as estimated from boron isotope analyses (Penman et al. 2014), our calibrations suggest that a large fraction of the observed B/Ca decrease cannot be explained by a pH decrease alone. The remaining B/Ca decrease can likely be attributed to an increase in DIC, but calibrations with additional species will be needed to further evaluate the sensitivity of the proxy to changes in carbonate system parameters across the PETM.\n[1] Allen et al.

The MAGIC campaign data provides a nearly ideal validation framework, as it samples marine stratocumulus and cumulus regimes and the transition between them. We classify MAGIC scenes by cloud type, and produce probability distributions for the key EDMF forcing/initialization and output variables by cloud type.

With the expected delay in the launch of the U.S. next generation of polar-orbiting satellites, there may be a gap in the afternoon MW data.\nThere may also be a gap in radio occultation (RO) observations. The mainstay of the global RO system, the COSMIC constellation of six satellites is already past the end of its nominal lifetime. A replacement of RO soundings in the tropics is expected with the launch of COSMIC-2 satellites in 2016. However, the polar constellation of COSMIC-2 will not be launched until 2018 or 2019, and complete funding for this constellation is not assured.\nThis study investigates how much degradation in forecast skill will occur as a result of these possible data gaps. Using the NCEP operational forecast system as of March and April 2013, two-month forecasts are carried out in which various combinations of MW and RO soundings are removed. The main results are that the forecasts are degraded only slightly in the Northern Hemisphere, even with all of these observations removed. The decrease in accuracy is considerably greater in the Southern Hemisphere, where the greatest forecast degradation occurs when the RO observations are removed.\nOverall, these results indicate that the possible gap in RO observations is more significant than the possible gap in the early afternoon orbit MW data.",

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), as a part of studies focused on establishing baseline conditions for weather and hydrological parameters, installed six weather and gauging stations along the NPR-A. This work concentrates on weather conditions, specifically air temperature. Data collected in each of these sites include air temperature (in all the stations), while summer precipitation and wind parameters were collected only at three stations. We present an initial summary of air temperature evolution in the stations, from the installation of each site to September 30, 2013. Available information indicates that the entire region followed a pronounced warming trend, finishing with the 2010/2011 winter, which was the warmest winter recorded in each station. A nearly 20 percent increase in annual cumulative freezing degree days (ACFDD) occurred between the 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 winters. A preliminary analysis of air temperature on a monthly basis shows that, in general, the months of January and March of 2012 contributed the most to the increase in the ACFDD. In particular, the mean monthly temperature in March was in the vicinity of -35 °C in all the stations, which certainly marked 2012 as the coldest March on record.",

            "abstract": "The ability to measure the stable isotopic composition of plant and soil waters, surface waters and ambient atmospheric vapor is essential to understanding an ecosystem’s water budget, including how water cycles between the air, plants and the subsurface. With the advent of laser-based spectroscopy, e.g., Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS), the isotopic analysis of waters has become increasingly cost-effective and prevalent, with comparable precision to conventional isotope ratio mass spectrometry methods. However, early work [1,2] demonstrated that the accuracy of isotopic analysis by laser-absorption techniques could be compromised by the spectral interference from organic compounds, in particular methanol and ethanol [1], which are prevalent in ecologically-derived waters.\nHere we present results from the Picarro Micro-Combustion Module (MCM), which acts to destructively remove these interfering organic species from the analyzed water vapor stream by oxidizing them to CO2 and H2O. Analyzed samples include simulated plant water solutions, waters doped with varying concentrations of potentially problematic organic compounds, and actual plant water extracts. We find that the median offset between IRMS and a Picarro L2130-i outfitted with a MCM is less than 0.5 ‰ for δ18O and less than 1 ‰ for δD. In parallel to the destruction of organic contaminants, a software tool can also be used to assess the probability of spectral interference. This software performs a statistical analysis of spectral fit parameters, e.g., the shift in the spectral baseline, and compares unknown samples to clean standard waters.\nIn general, the most common primary metabolites present in plant materials include the light organic acids, e.g., benzoic and formic acid. At low concentrations (0.1 and 1%) formic acid does not appear to interfere with the resolved absorption spectra for H2O, HDO and H218O. Similar tests will be conducted for benzoic acid. Conversely, although methanol and ethanol are only present in trace amounts in plants, these alcohols can cause large interferences even at the low concentrations (1% and 0.025% for ethanol and methanol, respectively). Using these results, we will propose when CRDS for ecologically-derived waters functions best.\n[1] Brand et al. (2009), RCM, 23\n[2] West et al. (2010), RCM, 24",

During a nanomineralogy investigation of the Zagami meteorite, which is a heavily shocked Martian basaltic shergottite that fell at Zagami, Nigeria in 1962, we identified the new shock-induced high-pressure mineral liebermannite (KAlSi3O8 with a I4/m hollandite-type structure). The Commission on New Minerals, Nomenclature and Classification of the International Mineralogical Association approved both the mineral and its name. The name honors Robert C. Liebermann, a geophysicist at Stony Brook University, for his fundamental contributions to high-pressure mineral physics research. Liebermannite is the K-analog of lingunite (NaAlSi3O8 with a I4/m hollandite-type structure). It has an empirical formula for the type material of (K0.76Na0.14Ca0.02)Al1.03Si3.00O8, based on 8 O atoms pfu, and it occurs as aggregates of crystals up to 15 microns across. The Zagami liebermannite contacts one or more of augite (phenocrysts), plagioclase-composition glass, a silica phase (likely stishovite), ilmenite, baddeleyite, tuite, and merrillite. In one occurrence, lingunite is also present and presents sharp contacts with the liebermannite. Liebermannite formed in Zagami during a shock event that transformed a precursor alkali-feldspar to a high-pressure form. Liebermannite is stable between ~10 and 20-30 GPa; it melts congruently at high temperature and transforms to an I2/m phase at higher pressures. Liebermannite is, therefore, a potentially important indicator of shock conditions in Martian meteorites. Liebermanite may also occur in subducted sediments within the Earth’s upper mantle and may, therefore, be an important factor in the thermal evolution of the Earth in its role as a repository of 40K.",

Hypotheses for this variation were incorporated into the ecosystem model ecosys which simulated CO2 and CH4 fluxes along a topographic gradient within an arctic landscape at Daring Lake, NWT, Canada. Fluxes modelled at mixed tundra and fen sites within the gradient were compared with CO2 fluxes measured at eddy covariance towers from 2006 to 2009, and with CH4 fluxes measured with surface chambers in 2008. Slopes and correlation coefficients from regressions of modelled vs. measured CO2 fluxes were 1.0 ± 0.1 and 0.7 – 0.8 for both sites in all years. At the mixed tundra site, rises in net CO2 uptake in warmer years with earlier snowmelt were constrained by midafternoon declines in CO2 influxes when vapor pressure deficits (D) exceeded 1.5 kPa, and by rises in CO2 effluxes with greater active layer depth (ALD). Consequently annual net CO2 uptake at this site rose little with warming. At the fen site, CO2 influxes declined less with D and CO2 effluxes rose less with warming, so that rises in net CO2 uptake in warmer years were greater than those at the mixed tundra site. The greater declines in CO2 influxes with warming at the mixed tundra site were modelled from greater soil-plant-atmosphere water potential gradients that developed in drier soil, and the smaller rises in CO2 effluxes with warming at the fen site were modelled from O2 constraints to heterotrophic and below-ground autotrophic respiration that limited their responses to greater ALD. Modelled and measured CH4 exchange during July and August indicated very small influxes at the mixed tundra site, and larger emissions at the fen site. Emissions of CH4 modelled during soil freezing in October – November contributed about one-third of the annual total, and so should be included in estimates of annual emissions. These contrasting responses to warming under current climate modelled and measured at the mixed tundra and fen sites were apparent in their contrasting responses modelled under long-term climate change.",

Observations by the MESSENGER spacecraft in orbit around Mercury have established that Mercury’s magnetosphere has a global structure similar to those found in the other planetary magnetospheres, i.e., a foreshock, bow shock, magnetosheath, magnetopause, cusps, and magnetotail. There are also auroral signatures observed at Mercury associated with the precipitation of electrons; those signatures are not in the visible range, however, but rather appear as nightside X-ray fluorescence. Heavy ions (primarily Na+) from the planet surface mass load Mercury’s magnetosphere in a manner analogous to the internal sources of heavy ions in the other planetary magnetospheres, e.g., Earth’s ionosphere and moons of the outer planets. One feature not found at Mercury compared with the other planetary magnetospheres is the presence of a high-energy (> hundreds of keV) trapped radiation belt region. Although there are observations of high energy electron bursts within Mercury’s magnetosphere, these are not stably trapped and instead Mercury has a quasi-trapped population of ions and electrons with 1–10 keV bulk energies at about 1.5 RM (RM is Mercury’s radius = 2440 km) radial distance from the planet center. MESSENGER spacecraft observations and results from a global kinetic simulation model of the solar wind interaction with Mercury’s magnetosphere provide a basis for describing the transport, acceleration, and loss of plasma, those features and processes unique to Mercury, as well as those in common with other planetary magnetospheres in the solar system.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial ecosystem respiration is the combined flux of CO2 to the atmosphere from above- and below-ground, plant (autotrophic) and microbial (heterotrophic) sources. Flux measurements alone (e.g., from eddy covariance towers or soil chambers) cannot distinguish the contributions from these sources, which may change seasonally and respond differently to temperature and moisture. The development of improved process-based models that can predict how plants and microbes respond to changing environmental conditions (on seasonal, interannual, or decadal timescales) requires data from field experiments to distinguish among these respiration sources.\nWe tested the viability of partitioning of soil and ecosystem respiration into autotrophic and heterotrophic components with different approaches at the Howland Forest in central Maine, USA. These include an experimental manipulation using the classic root trenching approach, combined with continuous measurements of d13CO2 as well as targeted ∆14CO2 measurements. For the isotopic measurements, we used a two-end member isotope mass balance approach to determine the fraction of soil respiration from autotrophic and heterotrophic sources. Results from these approaches will be compared, and together used in a model-data fusion context to better constrain the partitioning of ecosystem respiration in the ecosystem model, FöBAAR.",

Properties of the SEP events and concomitant geomagnetic storms are discussed using in situ measurements at 1 AU. Temporal dynamics and latitudinal distribution of odd hydrogen and ozone densities inferred from measurements by the AURA/MLS (Microwave Limb Sounder) instrument are analyzed. We show statistically significant increases of nightime hydroxyl (OH) density in the middle atmosphere up to 5∙106 cm-3 in the latitude range from 70° down to 50° latitude in both northern and southern hemispheres in connection with peaks in proton fluxes of >10 MeV energy range measured by the GOES spacecraft. During storm main phases the nighttime hydroxyl density increases were observed at ±50° and above. The altitude range where these effects are observed (65-80 km) is consistent with precipitating protons of >4 MeV energy range. There is a correspondence between averaged nighttime OH density in the polar latitudes and 65-85 km altitude range, and energetic proton (>10 MeV) fluxes. Corresponding statistically significant nighttime ozone depletions up to 40% relative to the background values are observed from 70° down to 60° latitude in northern and southern hemispheres. Simultaneous measurements of ozone density by TIMED/SABER (Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry) instrument independently confirm that major nighttime ozone density depletions occurred in the altitude range of 65-75 km and down to ±50° latitude during strong geomagnetic storms. The SEP impulsive phases on November 8-9th 2004 and August 23rd -25th 2005 correspond to onsets of ozone density depletions. Larger relative ozone depletions are observed in the northern hemisphere in November and in the southern hemisphere in August.",

            "abstract": "With the extraordinary discovery of more than 1700 confirmed exoplanets and even more candidates from the Kepler survey, the need for more accurate structure and evolution models becomes very relevant. One important issue for gas and ice giant planets is to determine the behavior of hydrogen-water mixtures in their envelope. It is currently unknown whether a planet contains a dense, hot steam atmosphere or a water ocean that is well separated from a hydrogen atmosphere. Laboratory measurements demonstrated the molecular hydrogen and water phase separate at low pressure and temperature. Recently, computer simulations predicted that water and metallic hydrogen form a homogeneous mixture at pressure of 10 megabars and 3000 K [Wilson, Militzer, ApJ 745 (2012) 54]. The intermediate pressure regime that is of interest for giant planets in our solar system and sub-Neptune exoplanets has not been explored. We present results from ab initio computer simulations in combination with Gibbs free-energy calculations and different thermodynamic integration methods. We determine the pressure-temperature conditions for hydrogen-water phase separation and discuss the consequences for the giant planet interiors. Our findings may have implication for the heat transfer and the distribution of other compounds like ammonia in giant planets envelopes.",

Kerber et al. [2011,2014] have identified 200 pyroclastic deposits candidates based on color ratio and morphology images. Goudge et al. [2014] used the visible portion of the MASCS spectrometer to do further analysis on the spectral nature of the deposits. The authors have shown that the deposits have specific UV properties probably caused by Oxygen-Metal charges transfer, and a correlation between the slope of the UV-downturn and the age of the surrounding terrains.\nIn this study, we use the full range of the MASCS spectrometer (300-1400nm) to characterize the spectral properties of the pyroclastic deposits. Moreover, additional observations have been obtained since the last publications, and this allows specific studies of previously non-imaged deposits. This study shows that the visible slope of the deposits is changing as a function of distance from the vent, as seen on the Moon for pyroclastic deposits and their mafic absorption bands [Besse et al, 2013]. This is consistent with a decrease of thickness of the deposits that are mixed with background material. Surprisingly, the UV-downturn parameter proposed by Goudge et al. [2014] does not change as the distance to the vent increase. Eventually, the near infrared portion does not appear to have absorption bands in the range 900nm-1200nm, consistent with the very low iron abundance of the surface of Mercury. This could also be due to the lower signal to noise ratio of the near infrared portion of the MASCS instrument, and further analysis are needed to confirm these results.\nThe use of visible images from the MDIS camera has revealed that some of the pyroclastic deposits candidates are certainly correlated with hollows.",

            "abstract": "Cost-effective yet safe creation of high-permeability reservoirs inside deep crystalline bedrock is the primary challenge for the viability of enhanced geothermal systems and unconventional oil/gas recovery. Current reservoir stimulation processes utilize brute force (hydraulic pressures in the order of hundreds of bar) to create/propagate fractures in the bedrock. Such stimulation processes entail substantial economic costs ($3.3 million per reservoir as of 2011). Furthermore, the environmental impacts of reservoir stimulation are only recently being determined. Widespread concerns about the environmental contamination have resulted in a number of regulations for fracturing fluids advocating for greener fracturing processes. To reduce the costs and environmental impact of reservoir stimulation, we developed an environmentally friendly and recyclable hydraulic fracturing fluid that undergoes a controlled and large volume expansion with a simultaneous increase in viscosity triggered by CO2 at temperatures relevant for reservoir stimulation in Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS). The volume expansion, which will specifically occurs at EGS depths of interest, generates an exceptionally large mechanical stress in fracture networks of highly impermeable rock propagating fractures at effective stress an order of magnitude lower than current technology. This paper will concentrate on the presentation of this CO2-triggered expanding hydrogel formed from diluted aqueous solutions of polyallylamine (PAA). Aqueous PAA-CO2 mixtures also show significantly higher viscosities than conventional rheology modifiers at similar pressures and temperatures due to the cross-linking reaction of PAA with CO2, which was demonstrated by chemical speciation studies using in situ HP-HT 13C MAS-NMR. In addtion, PAA shows shear-thinning behavior, a critical advantage for the use of this fluid system in EGS reservoir stimulation. The high pressure/temperature experiments and their results as well as the CFD modeling are presented in a companion paper.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial ecosystem carbon (C) storage exceeds that in the atmosphere by a factor of four, and represents a dynamic balance among C input, allocation, and loss. This balance is likely being altered by climate change, but the response of terrestrial C cycling to warming remains poorly quantified, particularly in tropical forests which play a disproportionately large role in the global C cycle. Over the past five years, we have quantified above- and belowground C pools and fluxes in nine permanent plots spanning a 5.2°C mean annual temperature (MAT) gradient (13-18.2°C) in Hawaiian tropical montane wet forest. This elevation gradient is unique in that substrate type and age, soil type, soil water balance, canopy vegetation, and disturbance history are constant, allowing us to isolate the impact of long-term, whole ecosystem warming on C input, allocation, loss and storage. Across the gradient, soil respiration, litterfall, litter decomposition, total belowground C flux, aboveground net primary productivity, and estimates of gross primary production (GPP) all increase linearly and positively with MAT. Carbon partitioning is dynamic, shifting from below- to aboveground with warming, likely in response to a warming-induced increase in the cycling and availability of soil nutrients. In contrast to observed patterns in C flux, live biomass C, soil C, and total ecosystem C pools remained remarkably constant with MAT. There was also no difference in soil bacterial taxon richness, phylogenetic diversity, or community composition with MAT. Taken together these results indicate that in tropical montane wet forests, increased temperatures in the absence of water limitation or disturbance will accelerate C cycling, will not alter ecosystem C storage, and will shift the products of photosynthesis from below- to aboveground. These results agree with an increasing number of studies, and collectively provide a unique insight into anticipated warming-induced changes in tropical forest C cycling.",

            "abstract": "The Eramosa River located within the Grand River Watershed in Ontario, Canada, resides upon a densely fractured dolostone aquifer with abundant dissolution-enhanced channel features. While the bedrock aquifer represents a major component of the total water supply for the surrounding region, potential effects of increased groundwater extraction on surface water and surrounding ecosystems are not yet fully understood. In general, little is known about the nature of the interaction between surface water and groundwater along densely fractured sedimentary bedrock riverbeds. For instance, the timing and magnitude of groundwater discharge to surface water and surface water recharge in a fractured carbonate rock environment is expected to differ significantly from its alluvial channel analogs due to the presence of highly transmissive, planar and strongly orientated discrete fracture features that control flow. Non-invasive geophysical methods represent an opportunity to evaluate shallow groundwater dynamics with minimal environmental risk to biota and, ultimately enhance the interpretation of direct hydrogeologic data.\nPreliminary spatial electrical conductivity measurements collected along a 200 m reach of the river, suggests a seasonally dynamic hyporheic response over a riffle-pool sequence. Based on these results, time-lapse electrical resistivity measurements are being collected every 2-3 weeks along two ~50 m transects perpendicular to the river: the first transect considers changes across an intact bedrock section with exposed vertical and horizontal fracturing along the riverbed, while the second is positioned across a weathered bedrock section with a thin layer of course gravel and sand alluvium. The objective of this study is to collect electrical resistivity snapshots across the riverbed (6-8 m depths) to non-invasively quantify temporal and spatial changes in groundwater-surface water mixing from low to high-stage periods through multiple seasonal cycles. These geophysical measurements are being supported by multilevel vertical hydraulic head profiles, groundwater discharge measurements, continuous aqueous electrical conductivity of the surface water and groundwater, and time-lapse groundwater temperature profiles along lined boreholes.",

We present analysis of LAE observations from 1 July 2011 obtained by the dual-spacecraft Two Wide-angle Imaging Neutral-atom Spectrometers (TWINS) ENA imagers. For this event, TWINS provides nearly continuous magnetospheric observations from at least one of the TWINS spacecraft and stereo viewing during selected intervals. Using TWINS LAE measurements at several energy bins spanning 1-100 keV, we infer spectral properties of LAEs, and compare the LAE energy spectra with simultaneous NOAA in-situ observations. We also determine to first order whether the energy lost in the thick target region significantly shifts the thermal peak of TWINS-measured precipitating ENAs.",

The record suggests Late Quaternary variability of local outlet glacier systems, including the Lambert Glacier/Amery Ice Shelf system that drains 15% of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.\nWe present a refined radiocarbon chronology and beryllium-10 (10Be) record of Late Quaternary depositional history in Prydz Channel, seaward of the Amery Ice Shelf system, which provides insight into the timing and variability of this important outlet glacier system. We focus on three piston cores (NBP01-01, JPC 34, 35, 36; 750 m water depth) that contain alternating SMO and granulated units uninterrupted by glacial till; the record preserves a succession of glacial marine deposits that pre-date the Last Glacial Maximum. We utilize the ramped pyrolysis preparatory method to improve the bulk organic carbon 14C-based chronology for Prydz Channel. To determine if the SMO intervals reflect open water conditions or sub-ice shelf advection, we measured sedimentary 10Be concentrations. Because ice cover affects 10Be pathways through the water column, sedimentary concentrations should provide information on past depositional environments in Prydz Channel.\nIn Prydz Channel sediments, 10Be concentrations are generally higher in SMO units and lower in glacial units, suggesting Late Quaternary fluctuations in the Amery Ice Shelf. Improved chronologic constraints indicate that these fluctuations occurred on millennial timescales during the Last Glacial Maximum and deglaciation (~35-10 ka). Timing and depositional history of SMO units suggest environmental forcing on ice shelf evolution. While the driver of Amery Ice Shelf retreat is uncertain, our study provides new insight into the calving history of the largest outlet glacier in East Antarctica.",

            "abstract": "Global agricultural production is dominated by rainfed agriculture, and is therefore prone to disruption from climate extreme weathers. These uncertainties become more problematic when considering the projection of increased drought frequency suggested by several climate models for various world regions. Curiously, few regional analyses of drought impact of food production have been attempted. We collated and analyzed data from the last 25 years to disentangle the effects of drought (i.e. timing, intensity and duration) on agricultural production in different eco-regions and with varying crop types. Our preliminary results suggested greater yield reduction in annual (-21.5%) than perennial plants (-16%), in C4 (-21%) compared to C3 crops (-17%), and when drought occurred during generative (i.e. flowering until maturity; -16.5%) than vegetative stage (-15.5%). Although drought caused similar amounts of yield reduction in both tropical and subtropical regions (i.e. -17%), it carries a greater food security risk in the tropics due to inherently low productivity (i.e. less than half than in the subtropical regions). Consequently, cultivating drought-resistant C3 perennial plants (e.g. sweet potato and cassava) in the tropics could prove a viable adaptive strategy to mitigate the effects of climate variability. In addition, these crops have limited input requirements, are well adapted to nutrient-poor Oxisols and Ultisols of the tropics, and generally outyield cereal crops in the region. Our analysis is ongoing and needs to take into account agronomic traits (e.g. water requirement), as well as the energy and nutritional values (e.g. protein, minerals) of alternative crops. Our results could inform the selection and development of new cultivars for the drought-prone regions of the world.",

            "abstract": "Glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) is a serious hazard in high, mountainous regions. In the Himalayas, catastrophic risks of GLOFs have increased in recent years because most Himalayan glaciers have experienced remarkable downwasting under a warming climate. However, current knowledge about the distribution and recent changes in glacial lakes within the central Himalaya mountain range is still limited. Here, we conducted a systematic investigation of the glacial lakes within the entire central Himalaya range by using an object-oriented image processing method based on the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) or Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) images from 1990 to 2010. We extracted the lake boundaries for four time points (1990, 2000, 2005 and 2010) and used a time series inspection method combined with a consistent spatial resolution of Landsat images that consistently revealed lake expansion. Our results show that the glacial lakes expanded rapidly by 17.11% from 1990 to 2010. The pre-existing, larger glacial lakes, rather than the newly formed lakes, contributed most to the areal expansion. The greatest expansions occurred at the altitudinal zones between 4800 m and 5600 m at the north side of the main Himalayan range and between 4500 m and 5600 m at the south side, respectively. Based on the expansion rate, area and type of glacial lakes, we identified 67 rapidly expanding glacial lakes in the central Himalayan region that need to be closely monitored in the future. The warming and increasing amounts of light-absorbing constituents of snow and ice could have accelerated the melting that directly affected the glacial lake expansion. Across the main central Himalayas, glacial lakes at the north side show more remarkable expansion than those at the south side. An effective monitoring and warning system for critical glacial lakes is urgently needed.",

The SEAC4RS campaign conducted in August-September 2013 over the Southeast US offers an unprecedented dataset to improve our understanding of isoprene oxidation mechanisms in both low-NO­x and high-NOx chemical environments. A nested high-resolution (0.25°x0.3125°) version of the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model including isoprene oxidation by multiple mechanisms provides a framework for testing these mechanisms and exploring their sensitivity to chemical drivers. Here, we compare GEOS-Chem output to SEAC4RS aircraft observations, focusing on isoprene and its oxidation products including methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), methacrolein (MACR), formaldehyde (HCHO), isoprene peroxides, and isoprene nitrates, among others. The observations indicate a strong correlation between HCHO and organic nitrates, and we show that GEOS-Chem is able to reproduce this relationship. We interpret this and other observed species-species correlations using detailed model results and sensitivity simulations, focusing on changes in isoprene chemistry between low-NO­x and high-NOx environments. In the boundary layer, the standard GEOS-Chem isoprene mechanism shows good predictive capability for isoprene and some oxidation products including HCHO and MVK+MACR. We use the simulation to test the sensitivity of the HCHO yield to NOx concentration in the context of improved interpretation of satellite HCHO observations. The standard GEOS-Chem simulation has less success representing the variability of first and second generation isoprene nitrates, and we evaluate our current understanding of high-NOx isoprene chemistry in the context of these discrepancies. We find that including uptake of isoprene nitrates by aerosol improves agreement with the aircraft observations, and we evaluate the influence of this uptake on NOx and aerosol budgets.",

The Detailed Investigation Areas will be selected focusing on the suitability for the host rock where the underground facility is constructed, after a series of surface-based investigations at Preliminary Investigation Areas. The suitability shall be judged by considering multi-disciplinary performances of the rock mass, such as thermal, hydrologic, mechanical and geochemical conditions and the volume of rock mass, based on the site models. However, the limited geoscientific information yields relatively large uncertainties of the site models, especially the hydrogeological models due to a wider variability of hydraulic properties. The uncertainties make it difficult to clarify the relationship among the site investigation, repository design (Design) and safety assessment (SA). In this study, groundwater travel time is identified as one of the important evaluation factors relevant for SA in terms of hydrology. In addition, the various options for evaluating the groundwater travel time are put together into a tree diagram. The highest level of the tree diagram is defined by the evaluation factor (groundwater travel time), and evaluation methods are systematically classified into multi-levels that comprise analytical methods/models in one dimension and three dimensions, parameters, datasets, data and investigation methods. Multiple options, such as alternative cases and/or models caused by uncertainties in data, analytical methods and models, are incorporated at each level of the tree diagrams. The feasibility of the tree diagram was examined by tracing both analytical options. Through this examination, the importance of interaction among the site investigation, SA and Design was also demonstrated.",

            "abstract": "Here we describe a new methodology for near-field tsunami inundation forecasting. We designed an algorithm that can produce high-resolution tsunami inundation maps of near-field sites before the actual tsunami hits the shore. This algorithm relies on a database of precomputed tsunami waveforms at several near-shore points and precomputed tsunami inundation maps from various earthquake fault model scenarios. By using numerical forward model, it takes several hours to simulate tsunami inundation in each site from each fault model. After information about a tsunami source is estimated, tsunami waveforms at near-shore points can be simulated in real-time. A scenario that gives the most similar tsunami waveforms is selected as the site-specific best scenario and the tsunami inundation from that scenario is selected as the tsunami inundation forecast. To test the algorithm, tsunami inundation along the Sanriku coast is forecasted by using source models for the 2011 Tohoku earthquake estimated from GPS, W phase, or offshore tsunami waveform data. The forecasting algorithm is capable of providing a tsunami inundation forecast that is similar to that obtained by numerical forward modeling, but with remarkably smaller CPU time. The time required to forecast tsunami inundation in 15 coastal sites from the Sendai Plain to Miyako City is approximately 3 minutes after information about the tsunami source is obtained. We found that the tsunami inundation forecasts from the 5-min GPS, 10-min W phase fault models, and 35-min tsunami source model are all reliable for tsunami early warning purposes and quantitatively match the observations well, although the latter model gives tsunami forecasts with highest overall accuracy. We evaluated the effectiveness of this algorithm in the real world by carrying out a tsunami evacuation drill in Kushiro City, Hokkaido, Japan, involving the city residents. The participants found that the use of the tsunami inundation forecast map produced by NearTIF was effective in helping them make better decisions with high confidence during the tsunami evacuation drill. This method can be useful in developing future tsunami forecasting systems with a capability of providing tsunami inundation forecasts for locations near the tsunami source area.",

            "abstract": "The prospect of freak (or rogue) tsunami edge waves from continental subduction zone earthquakes is examined. Although the hydrodynamics that govern tsunamis are formulated from the shallow-water wave equations, the dispersion relation for edge waves is similar to that for deep-water waves. As a result, freak waves can result from many of the same mechanisms as for deep-water waves: spatial focusing, dispersive (temporal) focusing, modulation instability, and mode coupling from resonant interaction. The focus of this study is on determining the likelihood of freak edge waves from the two nonlinear mechanisms: modulation instability and mode coupling. The initial conditions are provided by coseismic vertical displacement from a subduction thrust earthquake. A two-dimensional stochastic slip model is used to generate a range of coseismic displacement realizations. The slip model is defined by a power-law wavenumber spectrum and Lévy-law distributed random variables. Tsunami edge waves produced by this source model have a broader spectrum with energy distributed across many more modes compared to edge waves derived from the simplified earthquake sources used in the past. To characterize modulation instability, methods developed for a random sea are modified for seismogenic edge waves. The Benjamin-Feir parameter constrains how many unstable wave packets are possible in a time series of finite length. In addition, because seismogenic tsunami edge wave energy is distributed across a number of modes, nonlinear mode coupling can result both in the collinear case and in the counter-propagating case where edge waves are reflected by coastline irregularities. Mode coupling results in the appearance of a third edge wave mode that can greatly increase the variability in wave heights. Determination of possible freak tsunami edge waves is important for assessing the tsunami hazard at longshore locations distant from the rupture zone of continental subduction zone earthquakes.",

Because NICE incorporates 3-D groundwater sub-model and expands from previous 1- or 2-D or steady state, the model can simulate the lateral transport pronounced at steeper-slope or riparian/floodplain with surface-groundwater connectivity. River discharge and groundwater level simulated by NICE agreed reasonably with those in previous researches (Niu et al., 2007; Fan et al., 2013) and extended to clarify lateral subsurface also has important role on global hydrologic cycle (Nakayama, 2011b; Nakayama and Shankman, 2013b) though the resolution was coarser. NICE was further developed to incorporate biogeochemical cycle including reaction between inorganic and organic carbons in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The missing role of carbon cycle simulated by NICE, for example, CO2 evasion from inland water (global total flux was estimated as about 1.0 PgC/yr), was relatively in good agreement in that estimated by empirical relation using previous pCO2 data (Aufdenkampe et al., 2011; Laruelle et al., 2013). The model would play important role in identification of greenhouse gas balance of the biosphere and spatio-temporal hot spots, and bridging gap between top-down and bottom-up approaches (Cole et al. 2007; Frei et al. 2012).",

            "abstract": "Cloud processing often makes bimodal aerosol spectra from which size at minimal concentration infers cloud effective supersaturation (Seff) (Hoppel et al. 1986). Particle hygroscopicity (κ) converts this Hoppel minimum to critical S, Sc. Only lower Sc particles that produce cloud droplets are physically (coalescence) or chemically (gas-to-particle conversion) processed, which increases soluble content so that upon evaporation, these CCN have even lower Sc whereas the unactivated CCN do not change size or Sc. This results in the size gap at Seff.\nDRI CCN spectrometers have revealed bimodality in 6 projects for which Seff can be obtained without κ. However in 2 projects, MASE and ICE-T, simultaneous DMA measurements also provided κ by transposing DMA sizes to Sc; the κ that makes the DMA spectra agree with simultaneous CCN spectra (Fig). There was DMA-CCN agreement for 227 MASE and 50 ICE-T measurements. Since unlike Fig. a mean κ of the processed modes was greater than mean κ of the unprocessed modes, chemical processing was indicated; since most κ were lower than ammonium sulfate κ (0.61) chemical processing should move processed κ closer to 0.61. Chemical processing was also indicated in MASE by greater sulfate and nitrate concentrations for bimodal spectra and greater sulfur dioxide and ozone concentrations for monomodal spectra. MASE above cloud measurements showed higher κ and less bimodality than below cloud measurements, this is consistent with the higher above cloud NCCN, that κ is lower in pollution and for these less cloud interacted samples. Interspersed bimodal and monomodal CCN spectra under the ubiquitous MASE stratus suggested less than well-mixed boundary layers. Somewhat surprisingly there was more bimodality for the cumulus ICE-T clouds than the MASE stratus. ICE-T indicated more physical than chemical cloud processing.\nCloud-processing of CCN spectra is as important as CCN sources; it alters Seff, cloud droplet concentrations, mean diameter, spectral width and albedo. These changes and the lower Hoppel minima Seff than Seff from spectral comparisons with droplet concentrations; i.e., probably due to unprocessed small droplets, could be additional or counter indirect aerosol effects.",

            "abstract": "We explore a possible feedback mechanism of marine boundary layer clouds in response to expected 21st century changes in large scale wind speed. The mechanism proceeds via the effect of wind speed on the surface fluxes of sensible and latent heat, horizontal momentum (shear), and sea spray aerosol, and associated changes to cloud properties. An increase in wind speed produces, e.g., a higher latent heat flux from the surface, which causes stronger entrainment of free tropospheric air, and an adjustment in cloud properties. We have investigated how free tropospheric humidity and the evolution of the boundary layer modify the response of marine stratocumulus clouds to changes in wind speed. Results of cloud-system-resolving simulations are presented. The response of cloud properties and of radiative forcing to changes in surface wind speed is quantified under different free tropospheric conditions (dry vs. moist) and different boundary layer states (growing vs. steady state).",

            "abstract": " Ionospheric depletions have been frequently artificially-created in the past decades from releasing attachment chemicals[Mendillo and Forbes, 1978]. In the early phase of the ionospheric depletion, a boundary layer of width of electric scale length emerged and separated the ionosphere into two regions, the ambient plasmas and the negative ion plasmas. In the localized boundary layer, there exists sharp electron gradients and strong sheared flows, which have a pronounced effect on the nonlinear evolution of many plasma systems. Therefore, it reflects essential research significance to study the boundary layer processes in an ionospheric depletion. However, until now, few experiments have specially designed and conducted to characterize and study those boundary layer processes[ Liu et al., 2014].\nIn the work, We studied the evolution of boundary layer in laboratory-created ionospheric depletions. These experiments were performed in plasma conditions with key dimensionless parameters scaled to those of the ionosphere. These electrons depletions were produced by releasing attachment chemicals into pre-existing plasmas. These plasmas were separated into two regions by a boundary layer of width of electric scale length. In the modeling ionospheric hole, localized boundary layer, those fluctuations of the electron density , floating potential, and magnetic field were investigated varying with the plasma pressure and the partial pressure of released chemicals. These fluctuations were recorded by Langmuir probes and magnetic probes. We analyzed the fluctuation using digital spectral analysis techniques, and electrostatic and electromagnetic fluctuations in the lower hybrid range were observed. These modes may be electron-ion hybrid(EIH) and whistler mode, respectively. The possibility will be discussed in more detail during the presentation.\n",

There are gas-phase and aqueous-phase pathways, pathways that involve metals, and photolytic pathways. Considering all pathways in an atmospheric chemistry model is computationally expensive and unnecessary given certain pathway dependencies and limitations. Several sulfur chemistry parameterizations have been realized in the UH Vog model to convert sulfur dioxide to sulfate. These range in complexity from constant conversion rates to parameterizations that consider the dominant gas and aqueous-phase pathways. Past research has found that aqueous-phase pathways are the most dominant when cloud water is present, and conversion rates are higher in non-precipitating clouds than in precipitating clouds. This suggests that the input of a representative cloud field should produce improved sulfur dioxide and sulfate concentration forecasts. A liquid water content field from the Weather Research and Forecasting model is input into the existing sulfur chemistry module in the UH Vog model. Forecasts of sulfur dioxide and sulfate concentrations around the island of Hawaii are compared against in-situ observations, and model results using more simplified sulfur conversion schemes.",

            "abstract": "Human interactions with groundwater systems often exhibit complex features that hinder the sustainable management of the resource. This leads to costly and persistent conflicts over groundwater at the catchment scale. One possible way to address these conflicts is by gaining a better understanding of how social and groundwater dynamics coevolve using agent-based models (ABM). Such models allow exploring ‘bottom-up’ solutions (i.e., self-organised governance systems), where the behaviour of individual agents (e.g., farmers) results in the emergence of mutual cooperation among groundwater users. There is significant empirical evidence indicating that this kind of ‘bottom-up’ approach may lead to more enduring and sustainable outcomes, compared to conventional ‘top-down’ strategies such as centralized control and water right schemes (Ostrom 1990). New modelling tools are needed to study these concepts systematically and efficiently.\nOur model uses a conceptual framework to study cooperation and the emergence of social norms as initially proposed by Axelrod (1986), which we adapted to groundwater management. We developed an ABM that integrates social mechanisms and the physics of subsurface flow. The model explicitly represents feedback between groundwater conditions and social dynamics, capturing the spatial structure of these interactions and the potential effects on cooperation levels in an agricultural setting. Using this model, we investigate a series of mechanisms that may trigger norms supporting cooperative strategies, which can be sustained and become stable over time. For example, farmers in a self-monitoring community can be more efficient at achieving the objective of sustainable groundwater use than government-imposed regulation. Our coupled model thus offers a platform for testing new schemes promoting cooperation and improved resource use, which can be used as a basis for policy design. Importantly, we hope to raise awareness of agent-based modelling as a new tool for studying complex human-groundwater systems.",

            "abstract": "Land surface temperature (LST) is the key parameter in a wide variety of the studies of evapotranspiration, soil moisture, surface energy balance, and urban heat islands. LST with relatively high accuracy is needed in the assessment of potential area for geothermal resource. Besides, the spatial and temporal patterns of land surface temperature are essential to monitor and define geothermal activity of a specific geographic region. In Taiwan, the geothermal energy shows opportunities both for the renewable energy and economic growth ever since the government’s master project of energy in 2007. Moreover, land surface temperature derived from satellite imagery may supplement or substitute for near-surface air temperature while lacking air temperature data or poor quality data from weather stations (measured at 1.5 to 2.0 m above ground). This study uses 2001 daytime winter data to study the relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and land surface air temperature (LSAT) in central and northern region of Taiwan, with the aims of comprehending the correlation and serving as the validation of satellite retrieved LST. Two data sources are to be used: 1-hour averaged ground measurements from the permanent weather station network of the CWB (Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan); Land Surface Temperature (LST) retrieved from the Landsat-7 ETM+ Satellite Imagery of USGS (U.S. Geological Survey). Differences between air and land surface temperatures are statistically compared. To verify the suitability of LST derived from LANDSAT Imagery, the relationship between LST and air temperature at weather stations was investigated using a difference analysis by computing average relative difference (ARD) and root mean-squared difference (RMSD). A linear regression model was also applied to correct LST for the difference between LST and measured air temperatures. The results suggest that LST is inappropriate to be used as a direct substitute for air temperature at weather stations due to the differences in their absolute values. However, the regression model can lower the difference between LST and estimated air temperatures to a satisfying level.\nKeywords: Land Surface Temperature (LST), Land Surface Air Temperature (LSAT), Thermal Remote Sensing, Landsat-7 ETM+, Correlation Analysis, Difference Analysis",

            "abstract": "Brittle failure through multiple cracks occurs in a wide variety of contexts, from microscopic failures in rocks to geological faults and planetary ice crusts. In each of these situations, with complicated stress geometries and different microscopic mechanisms, pairwise interactions between approaching cracks nonetheless produce characteristically curved fracture paths. We investigate the origins of this widely observed \"en passant\" crack pattern by fracturing a rectangular slab which is notched on two sides and then subjected to quasistatic uniaxial, biaxial, or shear strain. The two cracks propagate along approximately straight paths until they pass each other, after which they curve and release a lens-shaped fragment. Under uniaxial strain, we find that each crack path has a universal shape and aspect ratio which is independent of the material. By changing the geometry of the applied strain, we are able to achieve different aspect ratios for the crack paths. With birefringent materials, it is possible to interpret these patterns in light of the stress geometry, and we are able to explain the origins of these universal shapes with a simple geometrical model. Since a variety of aspect ratios have similarly been observed in geological contexts, this raises the possibility of using observed crack shapes as a diagnostic for the stress conditions under which cracks were formed in nature. In particular, the shape may serve as a means to infer the boundary loading in situations where history and dynamics are inaccessible.",

We investigate the potential impacts of climate change and land use/land cover change on global wildfires over the period of 2000-2050. We account for the impacts on wildfires associated with fire meteorology (such as temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity), vegetation density, as well as lightning and anthropogenic ignitions. For the present-day conditions, our model results successfully reproduce the spatial variability of wildfires, with highest fire counts in Africa and South America, which are generally consistent with observations. Fire counts under the 2050 conditions are projected to increase by approximately 27% globally, relative to the 2000 level. Significant increases in fire occurrence are calculated over the Amazon area, Australia and central Russia, while southeast Africa shows a large decreasing trend due to significant increases in land use and population. Changes in fire meteorology driven by 2000-2050 climate change are found to increase the global annual fire counts by around 19%. Modest increases (~ 4%) in fire counts at tropical regions are calculated in response to climate-driven changes in lightning activities associated, relative to the present-day level. Changes in land cover by 2050 driven by climate change and increasing CO2 fertilization are expected to increase the global wildfire counts by 15% relative to the 2000 condition while the 2000-2050 anthropogenic land use changes show little effects on future wildfire. The 2000-2050 increases in global population are projected to reduce the total wildfires by about 7%.",

The outcrops collected from the northwestern and south mountain range are argillite and slate, respectively. The observed high geothermal gradient and the abundant hot spring indicate that the area has a high potential of geothermal energy at a shallow depth. This paper is to illustrate the subsurface structure of the area by using the seismic reflection method. The result will be used to build up a conceptual model for tracing the possible paths of hot water and search for a site for geothermal well. In 2013, two seismic lines were conducted to obtain a preliminary subsurface structure. We used two mini vibrators (EnviroVibe) as the seismic source and deployed 384 geophones in a split-spread to receive the data. The CMP profile in EW direction showed one clear interface separating the sediments and the bedrock and the other deeper event, dipping to the east. The profile in NS direction showed the same image of the bottom of the sediment; many indications of faulting were seen on that profile as well. A major fault was also interpreted in that profile; however, whether the rock types of the formations were slate or argillite was still to be identified. The result of the rock type will directly affect the location of the major fault, which could be a major path for the underground hot water. To detail the subsurface structure, we just completed 4 more seismic lines in the study area in this summer. The two EnviroVibe were used again, but the geophone was increased from 384 to 432 channels. The geophone spacing was chosen as 4m, and the shot interval was set at 16m. Currently, core boring in two test wells is still ongoing. Besides the geologic studies, the rock samples from both outcrops and borings will be used to measure the P and S wave velocities, respectively. The collected seismic data are now on processing. Integrating the seismic profiles with data from core borings, surface geology, and physical properties of the rock samples, we believe we are able to provide us a detailed structure for studying the first shallow geothermal field in Taiwan.",

            "abstract": "Scientists rely on models of the water cycle to describe and predict problems of water scarcity in a changing climate, and to suggest adaptation strategies for securing future water needs. Yet these models are too often complicated for managers, the general public and for students to understand. Simpler modelling environments will help with finding solutions by engaging a broader segment of the population. Such environments will enable education at the earliest stages and collective action. I propose that simulation games can be an effective communication platform between scientists and ‘non-experts’ and that such games will shed light on problems of pollution and overuse of water resources. In the same way as pilots use flight simulators to become proficient at flying aircraft, simulation games—if underpinned by good science—can be used to educate the public, students and managers about how to best manage our water resources. I aim to motivate young scientists to think about using games to advance water education and management.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that the statistical probability of earthquake occurrence changes over the course of a day due to periodic variations in the tidal stress acting on faults. However, periodicity on a decadal scale (8.85 and 18.61 years) has been studied by relatively few researchers and clear correlations have not been obtained. In this study, by investigating historical large earthquakes that occurred over 1,000 years in Japan, it is shown that a stronger periodicity of 8.85 years and a weaker periodicity of 18.61 years appear in the seismicity along the Japan Trench and the Nankai Trough, respectively. The past strain and tilt observations conducted during the 1950s through the 1970s indicate that, nationwide, gradual compression repeated every 8–10 years in the direction of relative plate motion. These compression periods are in accordance with the periods of higher seismic activity in the area along the Japan Trench. This agreement between the phase of the increasing seismicity and the compression periods seen in the long-term cyclic crustal deformation suggests that the periodicity is not merely a coincidence and that the transient crustal movement may be relevant with the tides. Considering the seismiity in the Nankai region, periodicity of 18.61 years should be superimposed on the crustal deformation with periods of 8-10 years. However, the approximately twenty-year observation was too short to extract it. According to a recently proposed model based on the combination of the nonlinear fault rheology and oscillating tidal stress, the above transient crustal deformation with periods of approximately 9 years may be caused by long-term variations in the occurrence rate of tremors. The initiation of the past slow slip events in the Tokai area also agreed with the phase of the 9-year mode except for the largest event from the year 2000.",

One way to constrain potential loss is to compare soils with and without permafrost. We compared three sets of soil profiles developed in late Pleistocene loess from various slope positions in western Iowa (no permafrost for >10ka), south-central Alaska (no permafrost for > 3550 y), and interior Alaska (current permafrost). In Iowa C where deep C was protected by loess burial, % soil C declined most precipitously with depth (down to < 0.6 %C at 1m). Alaska soils with and without permafrost were similar in %C at 1m depths (up to 2% C). However soils with permafrost had 2X to 4X more C than non-permafrost soils at 1.5 m and maintained high and highly variable (0.8 to 11% C) C contents below 150 cm. Data provide an additional line of evidence that carbon in deep permafrost is highly susceptible to loss upon thawing. Meanwhile modeling and forecasting C fate requires more insight into C protection and stabilization by burial.",

            "abstract": "Time-dependent inconsistency of crustal movement is suggested in the Sanriku coast, northeast Japan. Coseismic subsidence up to 1.3 m of the 2011 M=9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake and a century-long subsidence rate of 1 – 10 mm/yr apparently contradict to long-term uplift rate of 0.3-0.5 mm/yr estimated from a flight of Pleistocene marine terraces. Several possible scenarios may explain such inconsistency: 1) the 2011 event was typical, contributing long-term subsidence of the 104yr time scale, 2) a significant interseismic contribution to long-term coastal uplift, or 3) a hidden huge event may occur to uplift the coastal region. To narrow the possible scenarios and reveal the history of vertical movement, we have been acquiring more paleo-geodetic data with better age constraints.\n This study detected continuous Holocene subsidence from a 40-m core data of the Rikuzen-takata, the southern Sanriku coast. On the basis of feature of core sediment, sedimentary facies was divided into braided river, tidal influenced environment, delta, and terrestrial marsh, from lower to upper, in ascending order. Age-depth curve was described based on twenty-five 14C ages. For the estimation of Holocene vertical movement, observed relative sea-level (RSL) was compared with theoretical RSL. RSL at 10 to 9.0 ka was estimated at the altitude of -30 to -27 m by using altitude of depositional surface of tidal deposits shown by both age-depth curve and molluscan shells in intertidal zone. Estimated RSL is lower than theoretical RSL without tectonic effect. This difference can be explained by Holocene tectonic subsidence. Moreover, detected subsidence is consistent with coseisimic subsidence of the 2011 event and a century-long submergence. Unlike the previous arguments of long-term uplift particularly in northern Sanriku, this agreement possibly suggests that the south Sanriku coast instead has been subsided by both the 2011 type coseismic and interseismic deformation on the 104 yr time-scale.",

Sediment samples were obtained during IODP Expedition 337 in the western Pacific Ocean, from 1,498 meters below the seafloor (mbsf; samples 6R3), 1,951-1,999 mbsf (19R1), and 2,406 mbsf (29R7). These samples were initially mixed with marine broth and cultivated under anaerobic conditions at pressure of 35 MPa (megapascal) and temperatures of 35° C, 45° C, and 55° C for 3 months on board the Chikyu. Single colonies were isolated via plating on marine broth. Then, six strains of bacteria were identified, 6R3-1, 6R3-15, 19R1-5, 29R7-12B, 29R7-12M, and 29R7-12S. The six strains were then examined for optimal growth temperature and pressure. These organisms are Gram-positive, spore-forming, facultative anaerobic piezophilic bacteria. Major fatty acids are anteiso-15:0, anteiso-17:0 and iso-15:0. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the isolates are closely related to Virgibacillus pantothenticus, Robinsoniella peoriensis, and Bacillus subtilis. Because of their abundance in the deep marine subsurface, these microorganisms likely play an important role in sustaining the deep microbial ecosystem and influencing biogeochemical cycles in the deep biosphere.",

How does deformation vary in time and space, and why? How does crust evolve, physically and chemically, as rifting proceeds to sea-floor spreading? What is the role of sedimentation and magmatism in continental extension?\nWe developed two weeks of curriculum designed for an upper-division structural geology, tectonics or geophysics course. The curriculum includes lectures, labs, and in-class activities that can be used as a whole or individually. The first set of materials introduces the RCL initiative to students and has them analyze the bathymetry and oblique-rifting geometry of the GOC in an exercise using GeoMapApp. The second set of materials has two goals: (1) introduce students to fundamental concepts of interpreting seismic reflection data via lectures and in-class interpretation of strata, basement, and faults from recent GOC seismic data, and (2) encourage students to discover the structural geometry and rift evolution, including the east-to-west progression of faulting and transition from detachment to high-angle faulting in the northern GOC, and changes in deformation style from north to south. In the third set of materials, students investigate isostatic affects of sediment fill in GOC oblique rift basins. This activity consists of a problem set, introduced in a lecture, where students integrate their findings from the previous bathymetry- and seismic-interpretation exercises.",

The upper part of Wang River has been mined for gold placer deposit for a long time by local residents. Previous studies, dealing with gold grain morphology and chemistry of this area, reported several heavy mineral assemblages. In this study, we focused on geochemistry of detrital heavy mineral assemblage occurring within placer gold deposit of the study area to trace the provenances of the detrital heavy minerals and to evaluate the economic value of the detrital heavy mineral deposits on upper part of Wang River.\nThe samples from the study area were prepared by panning and heavy liquid separation for analyses. An Energy Dispersive System (EDS) in Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was used for identification and image analysis of the detrital grains. The assemblage of heavy minerals in this area consists of ilmenite, zircon, hematite, magnetite, garnet, and rutile. Ilmenite (>21.5%) is the most common heavy mineral in the prepared heavy mineral sample. The proportion of zircon, hematite, magnetite, garnet, and rutile are approximately 15.0%, 14.7%, 10.5%, 5.8%, and 5.1% respectively. A plot of FeO-TiO2-Fe2O3 ternary diagram shows that most of iron-titanium oxides are plotted near or above the line of ilmenite (FeTiO3) – hematite (Fe2O3) solid solution, which is continuous solid solution above 800℃. It provides useful information about forming condition of the source rock. Furthermore, the combination of the chemical analyses results with detailed geologic setting of the study area can be a tool to trace the provenances of the detrital heavy minerals.",

Global climate change models predict surface temperature rise and higher precipitation during summer in Arctic regions, raising concerns about faster decomposition of organic carbon and consequent releases of CO2, CH4 and DOC. Microorganisms are directly involved in decomposition process by releasing various extracellular enzymes. In particular, phenol oxidase was noted to play a key role because it is related to dynamics of highly recalcitrant carbon, which often represents a rate-limiting step of overall decomposition. In this study, we monitored phenol oxidase activity, hydrolases (β-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, N-acetylglucosaminidase and aminopeptidase), microbial abundance (qPCR) and chemical properties (δ13C and δ15N signatures) of tundra soils exposed to artificial warming and rain addition, by employing a passive chamber method in Cambridge Bay, Canada. Warming and rain addition combinedly increased phenol oxidase activity while no such changes were discernible for other hydrolases. Stable isotope signature indicates that warming induced water stress to the ecosystem and that nitrogen availability may be enhanced, which is partially responsible for the changes in enzyme activities. A short-term warming (2 years) may not accelerate mineralization of easily decomposable carbon, but may affect phenol oxidase which has the longer-term influence on recalcitrant carbon.",

            "abstract": "Natural (or internal) climate variability can influence spatial patterns of sea-level variations on interannual-to-interdecadal time scales, through redistribution of ocean heat and dynamical changes in ocean circulations and surface winds. These variations can impact analyses of past and potential future sea-level rise, particularly when considering upper bound projections on regional scales. Here we analyze spatial and temporal sea-level variations due to steric and dynamic effects, using results from a 50-member climate change ensemble experiment that samples internal variability of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system. We use the low-resolution configuration of the fully-coupled Community Earth System Model (CESM), comprised of transient hindcasts and projections (1850-2100) using historic and RCP8.5 forcings. The transient simulations are initialized from unique model states, sampled from a ~10,000 year fully coupled unforced equilibrium simulation. This approach enables us to examine the effect of initial conditions uncertainty (or internal variability) within the coupled system, including effects of the full ocean which has a longer dynamical time scale than the atmosphere. We find that the internal variability within the coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model significantly affects spatial patterns of dynamic and steric sea-level changes across multiple timescales. We evaluate model skill using the historical record of past trends and variations across multiple scales, and we explore the implications of these results for sea-level rise projections. A key result is that natural variations of sea-level change can significantly impact upper-bound projections at regional scales, which can potentially impact risk assessments and adaptation strategies. More generally, these results point to the potential importance of the role of ocean dynamics and memory in influencing sea-level rise variations across multiple spatial and temporal scales.",

            "abstract": "The next generation of GOES, the GOES-R series, with planned launch in early 2016 offers improved spacecraft and instrument technology to provide more accurate, detailed and timely detection of high impact environmental phenomena, and at the same time significant opportunities and challenges in quickly creating, updating, and disseminating data and products in near real-time to produce more accurate forecasts and warnings. The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) will provide three times more spectral information, four times the spatial resolution, and more than five times faster temporal coverage than the current system with rapid scan imagery of severe storms, tropical cyclones, volcanic eruptions, and fires potentially as often as every thirty seconds in mesoscale mode and at least every 5 min or 15 min (as opposed to the 7.5, 15 or 30 min data from today’s imager). Additional advancements over current GOES capabilities include continuous total lightning detection and mapping of in-cloud and cloud-to-ground flashes from the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) with only twenty second latency or less, and increased dynamic range, resolution, and sensitivity imaging solar activity with the Solar UV Imager (SUVI) every ten seconds. The total lightning is very useful for identifying hazardous and severe thunderstorms, monitoring storm intensification and tracking evolution. Used in tandem with radar, visible satellite, and surface observations, total lightning data has great potential to increase lead time for severe storm warnings and improve public safety. The space weather instruments provide more detailed observations of coronal mass ejection, solar flares, and energetic particles to produce more accurate forecasts and warnings of solar storms. The data from the ABI, GLM and space weather instruments will have a wide-range of uses and multiple societal benefits in areas such as severe weather, energy, transportation, and commerce. This presentation will highlight the new capabilities that GOES-R will provide using recent examples of simulated and other proxy imagery.",

            "abstract": "In Malaysia, rain-induced landslides are occurring more often recently. Millions of Malaysian Ringgit are allocated for risky slope monitoring and slope failure measurement in the government budget every year.\nHowever, there are thousands of slopes which are classified as dangerous slopes, and implementing site monitoring system in all slopes, with physical devices, to monitor the movement of the soil in the slopes are too costly and almost impossible.\nIn our study, we propose 2 methods to predict the slope failure, which are (1)Accumulated Rainfall vs. Rainfall Intensity and (2)Working Rainfall vs. Rainfall Intensity, with water table drawdown period consideration. The curve of jointed data will be reset to 0 if the rain stop period is longer than the period of water table drawdown to pre-rain level.\nThe critical line, in these 2 methods, which determines if the slope is in a risk state, should be generated by collecting historical landslides data. However, unlike the other developed countries, a complete historical landslides data in Malaysia is difficult to be obtained. We propose that the critical line is drawn by referring to the simulation result of the factor of slope stability F, with the slope parameters and rainfall data, to cover the uncompleted historical landslides data. If the curves cross over the critical line, the probability of slope failure is considered high.\nIn this study, the proposed methods managed to show that 2 occurrences of landslides, in Malaysia, could be predicted if it was applied earlier. In future, further study on fine tuning of these two methods and selecting the more accuracy method from these two methods may assist the government authorities to judge the movement of the slopes before disseminating data and information for early warning system.",

Castro Valley High School has tried to offset the cost of electricity by installing solar panels, costing the district approximately 3.29 million dollars, but have been installed incorrectly and are not operating at peak efficency. By using trigonometry we deduced that Castro Valley High School's south facing solar panels were at an incline of 10o and that the east and west facing solar panels are at an incline of 5o. By taking the averages of the optimum angles for the months of September through May, roughly when school is in session, we found that the optimum angle for south facing solar panels should be roughly 46o. This shows that Castro Valley High School has not used it's budget to its full potential due to the fact that the solar panels were haphazardly installed.",

            "abstract": "Chaos and Macula are geological features on Europa where the pre-existing surface material has been broken into discrete blocks surrounded by matrix materials and stand above the surrounding terrain with a dome like topography. Schmidt et al. (2011) recently proposed that Maculae and Chaos are analogue to terrestrial ice cauldron. A melt body would form in the ice shelf above an ascending warm ice diapir, with briny water erupting along the resulting cracks, and doming a result of crystallization. We study here the deformation and stress fields generated by plume ascent, ice melting, and subsequent crystallization to test whether the ice cauldron analogy can explain the morphology of cracks and the topographic signature of maculae.\nWe consider an axisymmetric finite element model of an ice shell built with ABAQUS. Ice is regarded as an non-associated elastic-plastic solid with Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion. We determine the stress field and in the ice shell and discuss the resulting topography and ice failure mode. Uplift is initiated by reducing the weight of a predefined diapir at the base of the crust. Melting is implemented by increasing in density and reducing the shear strength of a predefined underground lens. The material inside the lens remains solid but its modified material properties are more fluid-like. The stress fields generated in our models give a first indication of the failure mode and direction of cracks in the ice. To explain the observation of impure ice in the matrix of maculae, tensile cracks must propagate from the melt lens to the surface and allow extraction of brine from the subsurface water body. However, compressive stresses dominate in our models, even under the combined effect of diapiric uplift and melting, so that shear failure is common but tensile cracks propagating from the melt lens unlikely. Expansion of the ice when the lens crystallizes has little effect beyond negating stresses generated by melting. However, plastic strain is non-recoverable, so that a circumferential graben forms along the periphery of the melt lens and may join the underground melt lens. Shallow radial crack develop but do not propagate to the melt lens. Our models explain the observations of radial cracks and circumferential graben at Thera Macula but predict the emplacement of impure ice only along the graben.",

            "abstract": "Currently, most users prefer searching for the information using the more convenient and dynamic mobile information retrieval services to using the existing desktop PC services in the limited space, according as a lot of mobile terminals have been provided with the development of a variety of techniques. Information retrieval service using the mobile terminals has the strength that provides the personalized information results related to the users’ information request anytime and anywhere, considering the users’ mobility and portability. Therefore, for the information retrieval using the mobile devices I need the context awareness techniques which have been researched actively. In this thesis, I developed the context awareness ontology model for Geotourism as the representative method of the context awareness techniques to predict the user’s interest and foresee the information about which retrieval results and which places the user want to get.\nThe proposed Geotour ontology model is extended and designed from W3C Time Ontology defined in the international standards and spatial geometry feature ontology supported by OGC GeoSPARQL, so it can provide the usability and the function.\nThat is, GeotourFeature class is the subclass of ogc:Feature defined in OGC as in Figure 1. GeotourTime class which is for expressing temporal information of a certain Geotour features is the subclass of TemporalThing of W3C.\nFigure 1: Relationship between the international standard ontology and the geotour ontology model\nA Geotour features and a geotour map describes a part of ontology to represent the GeotourFeature composed of GeotourTime class and GeotourLocation class. The highest class to represent GeotourTime and GeotourLocation is GeotourFeature class. As mentioned in the previous section, our model inherited the temporal ontology of W3C. Figure 2 describes a part of ontology to represent the GeotourFeature composed of GeotourTime class and GeotourLocation class. The highest class to represent GeotourTime and GeotourLocation is GeotourFeature class.\nFigure 2: Top level classes of geotour ontology",

            "abstract": "We have examined the flux, compositions of biogenic components, and isotopic values of sinking particles collected by a sediment trap deployed in the sea ice zone (SIZ) of the Amundsen Sea from January 2011 for one year. Major portion of the particle flux occurred during the austral summer in January and February when sea ice concentration was reduced to below 60 %. Biogenic components, dominated by opal, accounted for over 75 % during this high flux period. The dominant source of sinking particles shifted from diatoms to soft-tissued organisms, evidenced by high particulate organic carbon (POC) content (> 30 %) during the polar night. CaCO3 content and its contribution to total particle flux were low throughout the study period. Contribution of aged POC likely supplied from sediment resuspension was considerable only from October to December, evidenced by low radiocarbon content and relatively high (30-50 %) content of the non-biogenic component. When compared to POC flux inside the Amundsen Sea polynya obtained by the US Amundsen Sea Polynya International Research Expedition (ASPIRE), the POC flux integrated over the austral summer in the SIZ was virtually identical although maximum POC flux was about half that inside the Amundsen Sea polynya. This comparatively high POC flux in the SIZ may be caused by persistence of phytoplankton bloom for longer period and more efficient export of organic matter owing to the diatom-dominant plankton community. If this observation is a general phenomenon on the Amundsen shelf, the role of the SIZ compared to the polynyas need to be examined more carefully when trying to characterize the POC export in this region.",

The study based on high-resolution (0.05 degree) daily precipitation data produced by APHRODITE’s Water Resources project obtained from Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, Government of Nepal. SPI were computed using monthly precipitation data from 1961 to 2004 for 78 APHRODITE precipitation stations around the basin. According to the trend analysis, most of the stations are characterized by increasing SPI value for all time scales which indicate decreases in drought magnitude in GRB. But few stations at High Mountain show significant decreasing trend. The Principle component analysis is also applied to SPI time series and it enabled to identify the spatial disparities in drought. The areas having high annual precipitation have increasing trends in SPI value and area having low annual precipitation have decreasing trend in SPI value for all time scales. This implies that wet areas are becoming wetter and dry areas are becoming dryer in the basin, which affects the smallholder and subsistence farmers the most.",

An initial decrease/increase in the equatorward alongshore surface winds weakens/strengthens the coastal upwelling and raises/lowers the coastal SSTs through oceanic mixed-layer processes. The resultant coastal warming/cooling, in turn, heats/cools the overlying atmosphere anomalously, decreases/increases the atmospheric pressure in the lower troposphere, generates an anomalous cross-shore pressure gradient, and thus reinforces or maintains the alongshore surface wind anomalies. The regional air-sea coupled phenomenon seems to be analogous to the well-known El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the tropical Pacific but with much smaller time and space scales, and may be referred to as California Niño/Niña in its intrinsic sense.",

            "abstract": "The biofuel industry is divided into four categories comprising of feedstocks used in 1st and 2nd generation bioethanol and biodiesel. In order to identify and quantify each biofuel feedstock’s potential for sustainable growth, each were evaluated according to self-developed social, financial, and environmental criteria.\nFrom the investigation and analysis carried out, 1st generation biodiesel and bioethanol were determined to be feedstocks not capable of facilitating sustainable growth. Results showed low earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of −0.5 to 1 USD per gallon for biodiesel and 0.25 to 0.5 USD per gallon for bioethanol. Results also showed a poor return on asset (ROA). The energy required to produce one MJ of 1st generation biofuel fuel was at least 0.4 MJ, showing poor energy balance.\nFurthermore, high land, water, pesticide, and fertilizer requirements strained surrounding ecosystems by affecting the food web, thus reducing biodiversity. Over 55% of land used by the biodiesel industry in Indonesia and Malaysia involved the deforestation of local rainforests. This not only displaced indigenous organisms from their habitat and decreased their scope of nutrition, but also contributed to soil erosion and increased the probability of flooding. If left unregulated, imbalances in the ecosystem due to unsustainable growth will result in a permanent reshaping of tropical rainforest ecosystems in Southeast Asia.\nAlgae, an example of 2nd generation biodiesel feedstock, was concluded to be the biofuel feedstock most capable of supporting sustainable growth. This is due to its low production costs of $1-1.5/gal, high biological productivity of 5000 gallons of biodiesel per acre per year, and high ROA of 25-35%. Additionally, algae’s adaptability to varying environmental conditions also makes it an appealing candidate for businesses in developing countries, where access to resource supplies is unstable. Additionally, its reduced net greenhouse gas emissions and low impact on biodiversity makes it a feedstock highly capable of stimulating economic growth yet simultaneously resolving environmental issues and infrastructural restraints in developing countries.",

            "abstract": "Increased understanding of the dynamics of the real ocean depends crucially on global-scale routine observations of oceanic and surface atmospheric variables. A new milestone has been reached with the launch of two dedicated satellite missions to routinely measure the sea surface salinity (SSS) fields from space. In the present work, a thorough analysis of the first 2 years of Aquarius SSS data in the South Indian Ocean is performed together with the Argo and RAMA data. This analysis is focused into 3 questions: How accurately is Aquarius observing the fresh Indonesian Throughflow and the salty subtropical waters? Can Aquarius give a spatial context for interpreting the data measured by the RAMA mooring system, which are highly resolved in time, but very sparse in space? Can westward propagating seasonal signals be observed in the Aquarius SSS fields as recently described in model simulations? We find Aquarius observations to be highly correlated with those obtained from Argo and RAMA, with lowest RMS differences found in the salty subtropical waters. In the tropical region, Aquarius gives slightly fresher SSS than in situ data mainly due to rainfall effects, except in the eastern basin where the freshening seems to be related to sharp localized leakages of very fresh waters from the Indonesian seas that the Aquarius L3 product is not able to properly resolve. Aquarius data are shown to reproduce quite well the annual cycle obtained from RAMA and Argo gridded data sets. The annual cycle is characterized by SSS propagating features with different characteristics west and east of the Ninety East Ridge, with the observed patterns better interpreted as a superposition of planetary wave modes. The SSS features are strikingly different from altimetry-derived sea surface height waves. Our results suggest that SSS annual propagation might be reflecting coupled ocean-atmosphere dynamics and surface-subsurface processes operating over the entire South Indian Ocean.",

            "abstract": "The eastern offshore of Izu peninsula is one of the well known volcanic active regions in Japan, where magma intrusions have been observed several times since 1980s monitored by strain-meters located nearby. Major swarm activities have been synchronously associated with coseismic and preseismic significant sizes of a volumetric strain changes (Earthquake Research Committee, 2010). We investigated the background seismicity changes during these earthquake swarms using the nonstationary ETAS model (Kumazawa and Ogata, 2013), and have found the followings. The modified volumetric strain change data by removing the effect of earth tides and precipitation as well as removing coseismic jumps have much higher cross-correlations to the background rates of the ETAS model than to the whole seismicity rate change of the ETAS, and further the strain changes precede the background seismicity by lag of about a day. This relation suggests an enhanced prediction of earthquakes in this region using volumetric strain measurements. Thus we propose an extended ETAS model where the background seismicity rate is predicted by the time series of preceding volumetric strain changes. Our numerical results for Izu region show consistent outcomes throughout the major swarms in this region.\n",

            "abstract": "A recent discovery, the Dakar Niño/Niña, is introduced, involving a local air-sea interaction in the southern region of the Canary Current, an eastern boundary current in the North Atlantic Ocean.\nIn the region (20°-15°W, 9°-15°N) located south of the Cap-Vert peninsula (Senegal, Western Africa), Sea Surface Temperature (SST) undergoes a strong seasonal cycle with a minimum variability during boreal late summer/early fall and with a peak in boreal winter when the surface trade-winds are at their peak strength.\nThe present study identifies that this area is subject to anomalous warming/cooling of the SST in boreal winter, during the period 1982-2011. A close examination of the relationships between the SST and the dynamics of the lower atmosphere reveals the important role played by the surface wind, particularly the meridional component and its angle to the coast. At the interannual time-scale, less (more) intense trade winds in February lead to warmer (cooler) SST in March.\nThe interannual variability in trade winds (speed and direction) also has an influence on the intensity of the coastal upwelling. These results have implications for a potential impact on the fish abundance and also on the local fishery and economy.\nSimilar regional warming phenomena have been described in other oceanic basins, such as in the South Atlantic Ocean (Benguela Niño), the southern Indian Ocean (Ningaloo Niño) and the North Pacific Ocean (California Niño). A comparison between the Dakar Niño and the well documented Ningaloo Niño suggests that an important difference arises to be the distinct feedback mechanisms from the ocean into the atmosphere. The Ningaloo Niño (Niña) has significant impacts on regional precipitation in Australia, through changes in SLP anomalies. While the Dakar Niño (Niña) appears to favor the wind-evaporation-SST (WES) feedback, at a local- to regional-scale. The connection between coastal Niño and ENSO is also analyzed.",

            "abstract": "The 28th Feb. 1997 Golestan-Ardebil earthquake (Mw 6.1) struck an area around the southeast of Sabalan Volcano in NW Iran, where the regional shortening between Arabia and Eurasia mostly is accommodated by a complex system of right-lateral strike slip and thrust faulting. The region is surrounded by rigid South Caspian Basin (SCB) in the east, North Tabriz right-lateral strike-slip fault (NTF) in the west, thrust faulting in Caucasus in the north, and thrust faulting along Bozghoush fault in the south. Therefore, finding the causative fault plane of the event has a key role in understanding of the accommodation of the regional strain in the region. Based on CMT moment tensor solution, the causative fault plane could be either an E-W right lateral or a N-S left lateral strike slip fault, whereas the recognition of the causative fault plane is impossible due to the lack of a surface rupture and also large error in location of aftershocks. In this work, we significantly improved the location of the main shock and its large aftershocks by using a multiple-event relocation method (HDC). We also added more recent events recorded both by local and regional networks and critical nearby S-P phases from the accelerometer network of Iran. The relocated locations of the main shock and its larger immediate aftershocks is in a good agreement with a N-S trending fault plane which implies a left-lateral strike slip faulting for the Golestan event. The presence of a North trending left-lateral fault might be connected to the way the strain is accommodated within the block wedged among SCB, Caucasus and NTF.\nThe relocated aftershocks mostly lie north of the main shock and that implies an almost northward directivity of the rupture. The depth of main event is about 18 km and the depth of seismicity varies from 6 to 22 km. Furthermore, some events are aggregated around inward dipping to subvertical ring faults and other fractures associated with the caldera of Sabalan Volcano. Those seem to be smaller earthquakes triggered by the main shock.",

            "abstract": "Understanding when and how Plate Tectonics (PT) began and what came before has profound implications for understanding the Earth because the transition to PT from the previous tectonic regime – some variant of deformable lid tectonics (DLT)– resulted in faster cooling and enhanced recycling of surface materials to depth. The transition to PT also would have impacted ocean chemistry, climate and life evolution. There is no consensus about when PT began on Earth; estimates range from >4.2 Ga to ~0.85 Ga. Three pillars of a robust Theory of the Earth illustrate the importance of answering this question: (1) the solid Earth volatile cycle; (2) the Urey ratio; and (3) the kimberlite enigma. For (1), it is now clear that subduction injects more H2O (and probably CO2) into Earth’s mantle– where it is stored - than is released to the surface by igneous activity. Presumably the volatile flux from the surface into the mantle was lower during DLT episodes, although delamination and Rayleigh-Taylor drippings would have sent some. Constraining PT H2O and CO2 fluxes requires knowing when PT began and interior soaking accelerated. Regarding (2), estimating Earth’s Urey ratio (Ur; heat production/heat loss) evolution requires avoiding the “thermal catastrophe” implying that if Earth has been cooling off as fast as presently (Ur ~0.2) then it must have been totally molten 1-2 Ga; a transition from DLT (high Ur) to PT (low Ur) may resolve the paradox. Finally (3), why are the vast majority of kimberlites of Phaneozoic age? Is it because erosion has removed the evidence or because sufficient H2O-CO2 rich fluids that drive such eruptions have only been delivered below cratonic lithosphere since deep subduction associated with PT began? Determining when did PT start, what was Earth’s DLT-regime before this, and how did the transition occur will require the insights of the entire geoscientific community, providing a worthy set of 21st Century geoscientific research priorities.",

            "abstract": "At oceanic fronts, due to the sloping isopycnals and associated thermal wind shear, the possible directions of the group velocity of inertia-gravity waves (IGWs) depart from the classical St Andrew's cross. However, waves oscillating at the Coriolis frequency,\nf\n, keep one of these directions horizontal, while the other direction allows for vertical propagation of energy. This implies the existence of critical reflections of inertial waves off the sea surface, after which incident wave energy cannot escape. This is analogous to the classical critical reflection of IGWs in a quiescent medium off a sloping bottom. We present a series of numerical experiments exploring parameter space that highlight properties of critical (\nω=f\n), sub-critical (\nω>f\n), and super-critical (\nω<f\n) reflections. Super-critical reflections are favorable to triadic resonant interactions and therefore exhibit significant propagation of super-harmonic energy back downwards, while sub-critical reflections inhibit triadic interactions and dissipate energy locally. We also report on irreversible energy exchanges between IGWs and geostrophically-balanced frontal flows that are enabled by friction and the modification of IGW-physics at fronts. This is exacerbated during critical reflections where intense frictional effects under the surface induce a net transfer of energy from the balanced flow to ageostrophic motions, which are subsequently dissipated.",

            "abstract": "As the UAV is widely used in earthquake disaster prevention and mitigation, the efficiency of UAV image processing determines the effectiveness of its application to pre-earthquake disaster prevention, post-earthquake emergency rescue, and disaster assessment. Because of bad weather conditions after destructive earthquake, the wide field cameras captured images with serious vignetting phenomenon, which can significantly affects the speed and efficiency of image mosaic, especially the extraction of pre-earthquake building and geological structure information and also the accuracy of post-earthquake quantitative damage extraction. In this paper, an improved radial gradient correction method (IRGCM) was developed to reduce the influence from random distribution of land surface objects on the images based on radial gradient correction method (RGCM, Y. Zheng, 2008; 2013). First, a mean-value image was obtained by the average of serial UAV images. It was used as calibration instead of single images to obtain the comprehensive vignetting function by using RGCM. Then each UAV image would be corrected by the comprehensive vignetting function. A case study was done to correct the UAV images sequence, which were obtained in Lushan County after Ms7.0 Lushan, Sichuan, China earthquake occurred on April 20, 2013. The results show that the comprehensive vignetting function generated by IRGCM is more robust and accurate to express the specific optical response of camera in a particular setting. Thus it is particularly useful for correction of a mass UAV images with non-uniform illuminations. Also, the correction process was simplified and it is faster than conventional methods. After correction, the images have better radial homogeneity and clearer details, to a certain extent, which reduces the difficulties of image mosaic, and provides a better result for further analysis and damage information extraction. Further test shows also that better results were obtained by taking advantage of comprehensive vignetting function to the other UAV image sequences from different regions. The research was supported by these projects, NO.2012BAK15B02 and 2013IES010106.",

            "abstract": "The scientific community concurs that the rate and the intensity of the current environmental changes have been accelerated by anthropogenic activities. Mediterranean freshwater systems are particularly vulnerable to such changes due to their inherent climate-dependent hydrological variability. We aimed to detect common patterns in monthly nutrient concentration time-series (1980-2011) from 50 sampling stations across a Mediterranean river basin, and to attribute their spatiotemporal variability to environmental factors at the basin and regional scales. Dynamic Factor Analysis (DFA) provided the methodological framework to extract underlying common patterns in nutrient time-series with missing observations, a commonly encountered problem in environmental databases. Most importantly, DFA guaranteed the explicit consideration of the inextricable link between temporal and spatial patterns of change necessary to investigate the drivers and processes that shape them. Using complementary methods such as frequency and trend analyses, we sought to further characterize the extracted patterns and identify the drivers behind their variability across time and space. The extracted nitrate concentration patterns described a large proportion of the observed variability at the basin scale. Cycles of 2.5 and 3.5 years identified in nitrate concentration patterns were linked to climatic oscillations. The seasonality of nitrate patterns was either driven by hydrological or phenological processes, depending on the geographical location of the monitoring point. Land uses linked to fertilizer application further modulated the increasing and decreasing nitrate trends scattered across the basin. Conversely, phosphate concentration patterns did not fully describe the behavior of all monitoring points included in the analysis. Nevertheless, decreasing phosphate trends observed across space and time coincided with changes in land-use management practices in the study basin.",

GWs are stronger in the winter than in the summer and exhibit strong annual variation. GWs are stronger in the southern polar region (SPR) than in the northern polar region (NPR) except in the summer months. This is likely because there are stronger and longer-lasting zonal wind jets in the SPR stratosphere, as revealed from Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) wind data. The longitudinal variations of PE in the winter polar stratosphere are consistent with the elevated regions. In the mesosphere, the longitudinal variations of PE do not vary with height significantly.

            "abstract": "It has been proposed that the presence of methanol, a possible anti-freeze compound, in the primordial oceans in icy moons may affect the internal thermal evolution and the crystallization of primordial oceans. We have measured the thermal conductivity of H2O alloyed with methanol at high pressure and room temperature using time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) combined with diamond anvil cell techniques. The TDTR utilizes ultrafast optical pulses to pump and probe the dynamics of thermal diffusion, enabling precise measurements of thermal conductivity under extreme conditions. We found that the addition of methanol into the H2O suppresses the effective thermal conductivity of H2O-methanol compound. We will discuss geophysical implications of these measurements to the thermal evolution within the icy moons.",

            "abstract": "A long-term goal of the scientific ocean drilling community is to understand the processes by which the ocean crust is constructed through magmatism, deformation, metamorphism and hydrothermal cooling. Insights into the magnetic properties of the lower crust have come from drilling at oceanic core complexes and in tectonic windows. At the Hess Deep Rift, propagation of the Cocos-Nazca Ridge into young, fast-spreading East Pacific Rise crust exposes a dismembered, but nearly complete lower crustal section. Here, IODP Expedition 345 (Site U1415) recovered primitive plutonic lithologies including gabbro, troctolitic gabbro and olivine gabbronorite. These rocks exhibit cumulate textures similar to those found in layered basic intrusions and some ophiolite complexes. Metamorphism is dominated by background greenschist facies alteration associated with cataclastic deformation that likely results from Cocos-Nazca rifting. Some intervals display complex, multiple remanence components within individual samples. A high temperature component unblocks above 500°-520°C and an intermediate temperature component of nearly antipodal direction unblocks between 425°-450°C and 500°-520°C. In addition, a few samples display a third component that unblocks between 100-350°C that is nearly parallel to the highest temperature component. These multiple, nearly antipodal components suggest that remanence was acquired in different geomagnetic chrons, and represent the first multipolarity remanences seen in Pacific lower oceanic crust. Similar remanence structures, however, have been reported in lower crustal gabbros recovered from slow-spreading rate crust along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and have been interpreted to reflect protracted accretion or protracted cooling. In contrast, at Hess Deep unblocking temperatures appear consistent with temperatures inferred for successive phases of alteration, suggesting an alteration history spanning at least two polarity chrons.",

            "abstract": "A great earthquake (Mw 8.2) occurred on April 1, 2014 at 23:46:46 off the coast of Iquique, Chile (USGS). The earthquake generated a tsunami that was recorded at four DART buoy and seven tide gauge stations. The tsunami amplitudes recorded at two closest tide gauge stations from the epicenter (Pisagua and Iquique) are both 187 cm. A GPS station in Iquique located about 98 km SE of the epicenter recorded the co-seismic displacement caused by the earthquake. The recorded horizontal and vertical displacements are -28.90(± 0.16) cm E, 3.90(± 0.12) cm N, and -3.80(± 0.60) cm Z. We use tsunami waveforms and co-seismic displacement data in a joint inversion to estimate the slip distribution of the 2014 Iquique earthquake. We apply a multiple time window inversion to show the spatial and temporal slip distribution. The fault geometry that we use is based on the SLAB1.0 model and aftershock depths. The fault geometry resembles the curvature of SLAB1.0 but with shallower depth; strike angle of 347°, rake angle of 90°, and sub-fault size of 20 km × 20 km are used. By assuming the rigidity of 4 × 1010 N/m2, the seismic moment for the 2014 Iquique earthquake calculated from the estimated slip distribution is 1.04 × 1021 Nm, which is equivalent to Mw 8.0. The dimension of major slip region of the slip distribution is 80 km × 40 km, and the maximum slip amount is 7.06 m. The major slip region is located down dip of the hypocenter and the rupture propagates from the epicenter to the SE direction. Instead of an instantaneous rupture process, the use of a more realistic rupture velocity (2.0, 2.8, or 3.0 km/s) can better explain the tsunami data. The selection among these three realistic rupture velocities does not strongly affect the estimated slip distribution. We also estimate the slip distribution using three other fault geometries, two of which have the same curvature as our final model but with different depths, and the third has a single dip angle. Our final slip distribution gives simulated tsunami waveforms and calculated co-seismic displacements that are slightly closer to the observations compared to those that used other fault geometries. Deeper fault geometries give larger total seismic moment, and the precise slip amount on each sub-fault is strongly dependent on the assumed fault geometry.",

            "abstract": "1. Introduction\nIn the first segment of the central Indian Ridge from the Rodriguez triple junction, the Kairei hydrothermal vent field exists and extrudes hydrothermal fluid with richer hydrogen content compared to other hydrothermal vents in the world. Around the Kairei hydrothermal field, serpentinized peridotite and troctolites, and gabbroic rocks were discovered. These deep-seated rocks exposed around the Kairei field may cause the enrichment of H2 in the Kairei fluids. At the Kairei field, a hydrogen-based subsurface microbial ecosystem and various hydrothermal vent macrofauna were found. In the “TAIGA” Project (Trans-crustal Advection and In situ reaction of Global sub-seafloor Aquifer), this area is a representative field of “TAIGA” of hydrogen. To investigate how the deep-seated rocks (originally situated at several kilometers below seafloor) are uplifted and exposed onto seafloor, and the hydrothermal fluids circulate in subsurface, we conducted a seismic refraction/reflection survey and seismicity observation with ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs). This presentation will show seismicity of the survey area.\n2. Observation and results\nWe conducted a seismic survey around the Kairei hydrothermal field from January 27 to March 19 in 2013 using S/V Yokosuka of Jamstec. We used 21 OBSs.\nFrom the 50 days seismicity observation, we found many micro earthquakes in this area. A swarm of micro earthquakes exists at a location about 1 km northwest of the Kairei field. The swarm has a NNW-SSE strike, parallel to the ridge axis. The depth of the swarm is very shallow (~4 km from seafloor). This swarm may be related to the hydrothermal activities of the Kairei field. At the first segment of the central Indian Ridge, many micro earthquakes occurred. The depth of these events is deeper than that of the swarm near the Kairei field.",

Here we reported a new Al-bearing hydrous Mg-silicate, which was synthesized at 10 GPa and 1000ºC in the system MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-H2O (phase A (Mg7Si2O8(OH)6) + Al2O3 + H2O system). The composition of this new phase was determined to be Mg11Al2Si4O16(OH)12, and it contains about 12 wt% water. Powder X-ray diffraction and electron diffraction showed that this new phase has a hexagonal structure, with a = 5.1972(2) Å, c = 22.991(4) Å, and V = 537.8(2) Å3, and the possible space group is P‾6c2, P63cm, or P63mcm. The calculated density is 2.761 g/cm3, which was determined by assuming that the formula unit per cell (Z) is 1. This crystal structure is quite unique among mantle minerals in having an extraordinarily long c axis. We confirmed the stability P-T region of this new phase, and found that its stability region is very similar to that of phase A which is the high pressure hydrous phase in serpentine (Mg6Si4O10(OH)8) composition. We further confirmed that this new phase was stable in the chlorite (Mg5Al2Si3O10(OH)8) composition at 10 GPa and 1000ºC. The present results indicate that this new phase will be stable in Al-rich subducting slab instead of phase A and transport water into the deep upper mantle or even into the upper part of the transition zone.",

            "abstract": "We analyze seismic anisotropy for the Eastern Alpine region by inspecting shear-wave splitting from SKS and SKKS phases. The Eastern Alpine region is characterized by a breakdown of the clear mountain-chain-parallel fast orientation pattern that has been previously documented for the Western Alps and for the western part of the Eastern Alps. The main interest of this paper is a more detailed analysis of the anisotropic character of the Eastern Alps, and the transition to the Carpathian-Pannonian region. SK(K)S splitting measurements reveal a rather remarkable lateral change in the anisotropy pattern from the west to the east of the Eastern Alps with a transition area at about 12°E. We also model the backazimuthal variation of the measurements by a vertical change of anisotropy. We find that the eastern part of the study area is characterized by the presence of two layers of anisotropy, where the deeper layer has characteristics similar to those of the Central Alps, in particular SW-NE fast orientations of anisotropic axes. We attribute the deeper layer to a detached slab from the European plate. Comparison with tomographic studies of the area indicates that the detached slab might possibly connect with the lithosphere that is still in place to the west of our study area, and may also connect with the slab graveyard to the East, at the depth of the upper mantle transition zone. On the other hand, the upper layer has NW-SE fast orientations coinciding with a low-velocity layer which is found above a more-or-less eastward dipping high-velocity body. The anisotropy of the upper layer shows large-scale NW-SE fast orientation, which is consistent with the presence of asthenospheric flow above the detached slab foundering into the deeper mantle.",

            "abstract": "As result of long-term scientific activities in the southwest Indian Ocean, an extensive amount of swath bathymetric data has accumulated in the AWI database. Using this data as a backbone, supplemented by additional bathymetric data sets and predicted bathymetry, we generate a comprehensive regional bathymetric data compilation for the southwest Indian Ocean.\nA high resolution bathymetric chart of this region will support geological and climate research: Identification of current-induced seabed structures will help modelling oceanic currents and, thus, provide proxy information about the paleo-climate. Analysis of the sediment distribution will contribute to reconstruct the erosional history of Eastern Africa.\nThe aim of swIOBC is to produce a homogeneous and seamless bathymetric grid with an associated meta-database and a corresponding map for the area from 5° to 39° S and 20° to 44° E. Recently, multibeam data with a track length of approximately 86,000 km are held in-house. In combination with external echosounding data this allows for the generation of a regional grid, significantly improving the existing, mostly satellite altimetry derived, bathymetric models.\nThe collected data sets are heterogeneous in terms of age, acquisition system, background data, resolution, accuracy, and documentation. As a consequence, the production of a bathymetric grid requires special techniques and algorithms, which were already developed for the IBCAO (Jakobsson et al., 2012) and further refined for the IBCSO (Arndt et al., 2013). The new regional southwest Indian Ocean chart will be created based on these methods.\nArndt, J.E., et al., 2013.

            "abstract": "Wildfires represent a major source of atmospheric aerosols impacting radiative transfer, atmospheric chemistry and cloud micro-physical properties. Although former studies showed that the height of the aerosol-radiation interaction crucially influences the overall climate impact, the importance of fire emission heights in particular has not yet been quantified. In this study we use the general circulation model ECHAM6 extended by the aerosol module HAM2 to investigate the impact of wildfire emission heights on aerosol transport, burden and radiation. We replace prescribed emission heights by an implementation of a semi-empirical plume model. Furthermore, extreme scenarios of pure near-surface and pure free-tropospheric injections provide upper constraints of the emission height climate impact. For evaluation, the modeled Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) of all simulations is compared to MODIS data.\nOur preliminary results show the unrealistic scenario of free-tropospheric injections to entail a global net surface radiative forcing of -2.5 ± 0.4 Wm-2. In contrast, the differences in radiative forcing between those simulations with the simple plume height model and those using prescribed emission height scenarios are small (0.05 Wm-2 to 0.15 Wm-2). The comparison of simulated AOT to MODIS observations indicates that the choice of the emission inventory is generally more important than the choice of the plume height parametrization. The implementation of the plume model and the additional application of a diurnal cycle in fire emissions slightly reduces the model biases close to the major emission source regions. Nevertheless, on the global scale these improvements in model performance are largely negligible. Thus, the use of advanced plume height parametrizations in global climate models turns out to be required only for specific aerosol or regional climate applications.",

            "abstract": "An experimental system was built in the laboratory based on the electrokinetic theory, which contains a small scaled seismoelectric detector and a high resolution digitizer ( 1 MS/s, 22 bits ). The electrokinetic measurements are carried out with seismoelectric well logging technique in borehole models at high frequency (90 kHz), and the localized electrokinetic fields that accompany compressional wave, shear wave and Stoneley wave are clearly observed with monopole source in two sandstone models that are saturated by tap water. The magnitudes of these seismoelectric waves are in the range of 1-100 microvolt, which is useful for designing the seismoelectric logging instruments. The experimental results also show that the seismoelectric well logging signals are related to the permeability of borehole formations. Their amplitudes become larger in the high permeability model, which can be used to measure the permeability of rock formation although no such relationship has ever been provided in existing theories. We also made seismoelectric measurements in a lucite borehole model, but no observable seismoelectric signals were recorded by the electrode. This is not out of our expectation because the lucite formation is not porous and no electrokinetic conversion occurs in such material. However, the electric signal recorded in the Lucite borehole represents the background noise of our measurement system, which is less than 0.5 microvolt. This study verifies the feasibility of seismoelectric well logging, and also presents the range of seismoelectric signals in borehole saturated by tap water that is much closer to the condition of actual formation.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this presentation is to introduce a set of key concepts that can guide the development of ecological governance systems and briefly describe a watershed ecological governance project in south-central Texas. Ecological governance is a form of governance embedding ecological principles and values in all levels of decision making and action, from the personal to the global. The model of ecological governance discussed here incorporates ideas and approaches that are already being put into practice in many watershed governance projects in the US and abroad; it is based on the premise that contemporary governance systems will continue to evolve in this direction, incorporating more and more of the features of ecological governance. The watershed governance project described here was devised to ensure that the long-term ecological integrity of a small urbanazing waterhed in south-central Texas is preserved and that the water quality standards are maintained for present and future generations. The ecological integrity of small spring-fed watersheds in Texas are under serious threat due to rapid urban development dependent on groundwater supplies, continued drilling of personal wells that are exempt from pumping regulation, and lack of adequate legal jurisdiction for managing development in rural and semi-rural areas. The watershed governance project was motivated by a firm belief of local stakeholders that watershed protection is an individual as well as a community responsibility, and the recognition that a balance between growth and protection is essential to maintain watershed integrity. It is concluded that whereas emergent systems of ecological governance struggle to succeed in an institutional context oriented towards the pursuit of self-interest and competition, their acceptance will happen more readily as ecological principles and values diffuses throughout modern society.",

However, previous studies have not discussed in detail whether the influence is transported through the westerly crossing the Eurasian continent or by the thermohaline circulation influencing the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM). Using observations in the transition zone between the westerly and the ISM on the TP, pollen assemblage variations from a lacustrine sediment record indicate changes in circulations patterns. Before 16.8 ka BP, climate on the TP was controlled by the southward westerly and the dipole-shaped tropical Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) and rainfall anomaly due to sub-polar ice sheet expanding in the NA areas. After 16.8 ka BP, the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) exerted more influence to the Indian Ocean currents and then to the ISM, which was the dominant atmospheric circulation on the TP areas during the whole period.",

            "abstract": "Active acoustic surveys and passive detection of microseismic events have been performed in the clay environment of the Mont Terri underground rock laboratory during a mine-by test. From the active experiments, we highlight the transversely isotropic P-wave velocity field of the rock mass, used to efficiently locate the acoustic sources and validate the location procedure. From the passive experiments, we identify the stress-induced microseismic events with confidence by developing a restrictive but efficient multi-step filtering method. We deduce both their spatial distribution and processes from the location and focal mechanisms of the microseismic event sources. We observe an asymmetric geometry of the excavation damaged zone around the excavated gallery, without notable microseismic activity in the sandy facies sidewall. A burst of microseismic events locates in the shaly facies sidewall followed by two smaller bursts which occurred when the excavation procedure was stopped. The first one locates ahead of the excavation front and is associated with a dominant double-couple component, suggesting bedding plane reworking, that is, shear along bedding planes and associated wing-cracks. The second one locates inside the shaly sidewall of the gallery and is associated to a dominant compensated linear vector dipole, suggesting extensive cracking, that is, typical spalling damage in the vicinity of the stress concentration zone. We identify and discuss four major factors that seem to control the source mechanisms of the microseismic events: lithology, geometry of the geological features, gallery orientation and direction of the main compressive stress.",

The process occurring when internal tides meet a background geostrophic current at an angle rather than perpendicular to the current in a zonal channel is investigated using a numerical model with simplified forcing, topography and hydrographic setting. We compared numerical results of two different background conditions: (1) no background flow and (2) oblique background flow. Results indicate that the westward baroclinic energy flux tends to increase when internal tides pass through the background geostrophic flow. Different oblique angles of the background flow also cause different responses on the propagation of internal tides. The energy exchange between the internal tides and background flow is analyzed using an energy balance equation as well as the numerical results.",

            "abstract": "Sarawak is located on the northern edge of Sundaland in NW Borneo. Five sedimentary basins are distinguished with ages from Triassic to Cenozoic. New light mineral, heavy mineral and U-Pb detrital zircon ages show differences in provenance reflecting the tectonic evolution of the region. The oldest clastic sediments are Triassic of the Sadong-Kuching Basin and were sourced by a Carnian to Norian volcanic arc and erosion of Cathaysian rocks containing zircons of Paleoproterozoic age. Sandstones of the Upper Jurassic to Cretaceous Bau-Pedawan Basin have distinctive zircon populations indicating a major change of tectonic setting, including initiation of subduction below present-day West Sarawak in the Late Jurassic. A wide range of inherited zircon ages indicates various Cathaysian fragments as major source areas and the arrival of the SW Borneo Block following subduction beneath the Schwaner Mountains in the early Late Cretaceous. After collision of the SW Borneo Block and the microcontinental fragments with Sundaland in the early Late Cretaceous, deep marine sedimentation (Pedawan Formation) ceased, and there was uplift forming the regional Pedawan–Kayan unconformity. Two episodes of extension were responsible for basin development on land from the latest Cretaceous onwards, probably in a strike-slip setting. The first episode formed the Kayan Basin in the Latest Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) to Early Paleocene, and the second formed the Ketungau Basin and the Penrissen Sandstone in the Middle to Late Eocene. Zircons indicate nearby volcanic activity throughout the Early Cenozoic in NW Borneo. Inherited zircon ages indicate an alternation between Borneo and Tin Belt source rocks. A large deep marine basin, the Rajang Basin, formed north of the Lupar Line fault. Zircons from sediments of the Rajang Basin indicate they are of similar age and provenance as the contemporaneous terrestrial sediments to the south suggesting a narrow steep continental Sundaland margin at the position of the Lupar Line.",

            "abstract": "This study aimed to measure the effects of ecological restoration on blanket peat water table depths, DOC concentrations and CO2 fluxes. In April 2003 the Bleaklow Plateau, an extensive area of deep blanket peat in the Peak District National Park, northern England, was devegetated by a wildfire. As a result the area was selected for large scale restoration. In this study we considered a 5-year study of four restored sites in comparison to both an unrestored, bare peat control and to vegetated control that did not require restoration. Results suggested that sites with revegetation alongside slope stabilisation had the highest rates of photosynthesis and were the largest net (daylight hours) sinks of CO2. Bare sites were the largest net sources of CO2 and had the deepest water table depths. Sites with gully wall stabilisation were between 5-8 times more likely to be net CO2 sinks than the bare sites. Revegetation without gully flow blocking using plastic dams did not have a large effect on water table depths in and around the gullies investigated whereas a blocked gully had water table depths comparable to a naturally revegetating gully. A ten centimetre lowering in water table depth decreased the probability of observing a net CO2 sink, on a given site, by up to 30%.\nWith respect to DOC the study showed that the average soil porewater DOC concentration on the restored sites rose significantly over the 5 year study representing a 34% increase relative to the vegetated control and an 11% increase relative to the unrestored, bare control. Soil pore water concentrations were not significantly different from surface runoff DOC concentrations and therefore restoration as conducted by this study would have contributed to water quality deterioration in the catchment. The most important conclusion of this research was that restoration interventions were apparently effective at increasing the likelihood of net CO2 sink behaviour and raising water tables on degraded, climatically marginal blanket bog. However, had water table restoration been conducted alongside revegetation then a significant decline in DOC concentrations could have also been realised.",

            "abstract": "In the previous model inter-comparison studies (e.g., CMIP5), the projected soil organic carbon in ESMs and terrestrial ecosystem models showed the lack of coherence in the end of simulation periods. These uncertainties arise from the different structure of models and different parameters in soil processes and vegetation dynamics. On the other hand, we have different levels of uncertainty sources in the future projection, which are CO2 emission due to the different social development and judgments to climate change and the different climate patterns derived from different global climate models (GCMs). \"Which uncertainty source is more important?\" still remained unclear in climate change impacts assessments for terrestrial C cycling. This information could be a one of the criteria for how large uncertainty among terrestrial ecosystem models in projected SOC dynamics is acceptable, because we cannot entirely eliminate uncertainties in the modeling. ISI-MIP project, which was conducted by Potsdam Institute for Climate to assesse climate change impacts on human society and ecosystems, have orthogonal experiment design on RCPs, GCMs, Global terrestrial vegetation models (GVMs) [Warszawski et al., 2014 in PNAS]. In this study, we examined SOC and vegetation C dynamics in six GVMs obtained from ISI-MIP. This experiment enabled us to decompose the relative contributions to total uncertainty of the projection factors using ANOVA as follow;\nσoverall2 = σRCP2 + σGCM2 + σGVM2 (+ σinteractions2)\n In this study, we applied ANOVA to the changes in SOC stock, Veg C stocks, and NPP in the various spatial scale and in the various time periods. At the end of the simulation period (2100), global SOC stock changes from 2000 ranged from $-$195 to 471 Pg-C in the entire simulation set. On the other hand, global Veg C ranged from $-$27 to 543 Pg-C. The results of ANOVA showed that, in global SOC stock changes, the GVM uncertainty dominated throughout the projection period (up to 92% of the total variance). For global Veg C changes, GVMs and RCPs contributed 40% respectively of the total variance by 2100. Thus, the range of uncertainties are similar regarding global C stock changes, however, the causality of uncertainty were different among variables in GVM. We will discuss about the reginal patterns and their possible mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "The mountainous fjord landscape in the county of Troms, around its capital Tromsø in Northern Norway is prone to high avalanche activity during the snow season. Large avalanches pose a hazard to infrastructure, such as buildings and roads, located between the steep mountainsides and the fjords.\nA prolonged cold spell during January and February 2014 was followed by rapid new-snow loading during March 2014, inducing a significant avalanche cycle with many spontaneous, size D4 avalanches that affected major transport veins.\nDuring and shortly after the avalanche cycle of March 2014, we obtained 11 Radarsat-2 Ultrafine mode scenes, chosen according to reported avalanche activity. We further collected four Radarsat-2 ScanSAR mode scenes and two Landsat-8 scenes covering the entire county of Troms. For one particular avalanche, we obtained a drone-based orthophoto, from which a DEM of the avalanche debris surface was derived, using structure-from-motion photogrammetry. This enabled us to calculate the debris volume accurately.\nWe detected avalanche debris in the radar images visually, by applying two detection algorithms that make use of the increased backscatter in avalanche debris. This backscatter increase is a product of increased snow water equivalent and surface roughness, roughly of the order of 3 dB. In addition, we applied a multi-temporal approach by repeatedly detecting avalanche debris at different acquisition times, as well as a multi-sensor approach, covering similar areas with different sensors.\nThis multi-temporal and multi-sensor approach enabled us to map the spatial extent and magnitude of the March 2014 avalanche cycle in the county Troms. With ESA’s Sentinel-1 satellite, providing high-resolution, large swath radar images with a short repeat cycle, a complete avalanche record for a forecasting region could become feasible. In this first test season, we detected more than 550 avalanches that were released during a one-month period over an area of roughly 3000 km2.",

            "abstract": "Optimality models can only be as good as assumptions about the relevant constraints on plant function. To date, Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) have utilized relatively simple representations of the rhizosphere, chiefly assuming uniform, thick soil without restrictions to root development. In reality, many terrestrial landforms have features that severely impede root growth. These include habitats with shallow or skeletal soils over bedrock, karst or caliche. Experiments have shown that plants in these habitats are not limited to using soil water, but use a variety of strategies to extract water from rocky substrates, e.g., growing extended structural roots along rock crevices into soil pockets or perched water tables, developing flattened root mats inside planar fissures or associating with mycorrhizae to extract water directly from the rock matrix. While these strategies expand plant-available water sources beyond soil, the added pools are expected to have extraction and recharge characteristics quite different from soil. Here I ask how the dynamical differences in non-soil water pools should influence plant hydraulic traits.\nI built upon earlier work to determine how predictions of optimal plant function types change when model details are adjusted to reflect water uptake from non-soil sources. The model is a hydraulic continuum model based on Darcy’s law with optimization parameters representing biomass allocation between leaves, stems and roots, variable stem water storage capacity, and sensitivity of leaf and root conductivity to water potential. The rhizosphere is represented by two dynamically distinct water pools, the first representing a component with quick recharge and depletion (remnant soil), the second a non-soil component with restricted root density, potentially high storage capacity but possibly low hydraulic conductivity. The prediction of optimal plant functional types was significantly altered for non-soil compared to soil substrates, indicating a shift towards more extreme shallow-rootedness or stem water storage. Implemented within the context of a DGVM, these modifications produce lower productivity but higher drought resilience for vegetation in rock-dominated landforms and vegetation dynamics unlike that produced by merely depth-restricted soil.",

            "abstract": "Eruptions at basaltic andesitic systems are often characterized by e ffusive behavior. However, an increasing number of examples around the World indicate that these magmas, with low degrees of diff erentiation and basic compositions, have the capacity to produce explosive eruptions; thus presenting a considerable hazard.\nVolcanoes in the Chaîne des Puys (France), more speci cally the Puy de la Vache volcano, are good examples of explosive activity at basaltic andesitic centers. A combination of factors can explain this behavior: high magma ascent rate, high content of dissolved gases and high crystal contents. The latter leads to an increase in magma viscosity. The rheological properties of the magma control the eruptive style; viscosity itself strongly depends on composition, temperature, crystal fraction and vesicularity. In particular, an increase in crystal content may drastically change the composition of the residual melt and adds rigid particles to the mixture, inducing a complex strain rate dependence.\nHere, we are interested in the rheology of basaltic andesitic magmas as a function of crystal content. To quantify the eff ect of crystals on the viscosity, we measured the stress-strain relationship of the remelted Puy de la Vache lava by concentric cylinder viscometry at super and subliquidus conditions. Concurrently, we performed a textural analysis to determine the crystal fraction at each temperature. We also measured viscosities close to the glass transition using a parallel plate viscometer. We then compared the measured viscosities with those obtained from calculations using existing models. With the experimentally obtained stress-strain rate relationship of the magma at diff erent temperatures and crystal fractions, our goal is to design a model where viscosity varies across the conduit depending on the shear stress and strain rate conditions. This will allow us to characterize the potential explosive behavior of basaltic to andesitic magmas.",

The study considers dissolved organic carbon (DOC); particulate organic carbon (POC); and dissolved CO2. The study considers the loss from the terrestrial source; in-stream losses and production; and export to the continental shelf. The study used multiple approaches, including: mass balance studies; modelling and experimentation.\ni) Mass balance studies suggest that the UK losses 5 Mtonnes C/yr (21.8 tonnes C/km2/yr) from soils in the proportion of 7:22:4 (POC:DOC:diss. CO2). The mass balance studies suggest 3.5 Mtonnes C/yr (15.2 tonnes C/km2/yr) is lost to the atmosphere in the proportion 8:75:17 (POC:DOC:diss. CO2).\nii) UK rivers have short residence times (typically 1-2 days) and so the diurnal cycle becomes critical. Experiments show that turnover rates are close to zero overnight but that these can be periods of DOC production from turnover of POC.\niii) Development and modelling using physical rate showed that the loss of the DOC was between 24 and 37% - lower than that estimated from mass balance studies, but that the loss rate of TOC (DOC + POC) was between 57 and 80% - close to that estimated from mass balance studies.\niv) Studies of molecular change suggest that nutrient supply is not the limiting factor on turnover and that a position of “pseudo-equilibirum” is achieved that limits the net effect of the fluvial processes.",

            "abstract": "Analyses of Ocean Island Basalts (OIB) have shown that the Earth’s mantle contains isotopically distinct components, but debate about the degree and cause of variability persists. The study of silicon (Si) isotopes in OIBs has the potential to elucidate mantle heterogeneities. Relatively large (~several per mil) Si isotopic fractionation occurs in low-temperature environments during precipitation from dissolved Si, where the precipitate is preferentially enriched in the lighter isotopes [1], but only a limited range (~tenths of a per mil) of Si isotope fractionation has been observed due to high-temperature igneous processes [2]. Therefore, Si isotopes may be useful as tracers for the presence of crustal material in OIB source regions in a manner similar to more conventional stable isotope systems, such as oxygen.\nHere we present the first comprehensive suite of high-precision Si isotopic data obtained by MC‑ICP‑MS for a diverse set of OIBs representing the EM‑1, EM‑2, and HIMU mantle components. In general, the Si isotopic compositions of OIBs analyzed here are agreement with previous estimates for Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE). However, small systematic variations are present; the HIMU end-member Mangaia and HIMU-type Cape Verde island São Nicolau are enriched in the light isotopes of Si (δ30Si = −0.37 ± 0.06‰ and δ30Si = −0.39 ± 0.04‰, respectively; errors are 2sd), with compositions intermediary between Mid Ocean Ridge Basalts and chondritic values. Additionally, Iceland samples from volcanic complexes in the Northern Rift Zone show similar Si isotope compositions (on average, δ30Si = −0.40 ± 0.06‰). In contrast, the δ30Si averages of the EM-1 end-member Pitcairn (−0.28 ± 0.07‰), the EM-2 end-member Samoa (−0.31 ± 0.07‰) and other OIB localities do not show any significant difference from previous estimates for the δ30Si value of BSE [3].\nThe Si isotopic variability in some HIMU-type and Icelandic OIBs most likely reflects the incorporation of recycled altered oceanic crust in the plume source. However, the sampling of a primitive reservoir enriched in the light isotopes of Si, as suggested by [4], cannot be ruled out as a potential source of Si isotope variations in OIBs.\n",

            "abstract": "Quantifying the effect of abrasion vs. size-selective transport on downstream diminution of grain size and mass is a long-standing question in fluvial systems. While some authors have emphasized sorting by size-selective transport as the dominant fining mechanism in various rivers, others demonstrated the effectiveness of abrasion in certain fluvial systems. We present a synthetic grain-scale model in which we combine a recently developed geometric abrasion model (the so-called ‘box equations’ [1]) with a simplistic selective deposition rule. Box equations are capable to describe the evolution of both the shape and the size of the particles during abrasion, as opposed to previous models which only dealt with the size (or alternatively, the mass) diminution. We adapt our synthetic model to numerically simulate the downstream grain size and shape evolution in a short tropical river in Puerto Rico where we conducted a detailed field study. By switching off abrasion and selective deposition separately in the numerical model, the individual effects of these two processes can be examined. Based on our simplistic model we deduce that 1/3 of the mass of the grains may be lost only by abrasion in the examined river system.\n[1] Domokos, G., and G. W.

An optimization scheme is proposed to estimate two key parameters (Vcmax and Q10) by exploiting the seasonal variation in the net ecosystem carbon flux retrieved by an atmospheric inversion system. This scheme is implemented to estimate Vcmax and Q10 of the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS) to improve its NEP simulation in the Boreal North America (BNA) region. Simultaneously, in-situ NEE observations at six eddy covariance sites are used to evaluate the NEE simulations.

            "abstract": "The geochemical variability preserved in Ocean Island and Mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) is a key tracer of the magmatic storage and transport processes they experience during their ascent through the mantle and crust. The effect of these processes is to collapse the huge diversity of melt compositions predicted to form during polybaric fractional melting of a lithologically heterogeneous mantle, into the narrow range we see expressed in most ocean island and mid-ocean ridge settings. Magma mixing can therefore be seen as contaminating the variance structure of primitive mantle melts, akin to the way in which wall-rock assimilation contaminates melts by chemical addition.\nThe key observation from the melt inclusion and whole-rock records from ocean islands such as Iceland, is that as crystallisation proceeds mixing in magma chambers progressively reduces geochemical variability, until by ~5wt% MgO almost all primary chemical diversity has been lost. These chemical systematics allow us to extend the observations made at ocean islands to make predictions about how mixing processes should operate in MORB generally and the key factors controlling mixing efficiency: melt flow out of the mantle, crustal thickness, magma supply rate, and by extension spreading rate, and mantle potential temperature.\nHowever, with its low sampling density, the global MORB database does not easily allow testing of these hypotheses. We have developed a novel geospatial statistical analysis to bridge the gap between observations made on a small scale – at single ocean islands and ridge segments – to the entire global dataset of MORB chemistry. By analysing the geochemical variance in MORB over a range of bandwidths we have captured the ~200km lengthscale at which the simple relationships between geochemical variability and MgO appear.\nOur results demonstrate that on short lengthscales mantle chemical structure and magmatic processes operate coherently in destruction of geochemical variability. That the physical conditions promoting magma mixing during transport and storage may change from setting to setting has significant implications for how we should view the heterogeneity expressed in suites of basalts, as mixing affects both the range of basalt compositions erupting and the apparent composition of isotopic endmembers.",

This study aims to improve the simulation of peak flows under climate change in Lanjiang catchment, East China by comparing two approaches: post-processing of peak flows and multi-objective calibration. Two hydrological models (SWAT and GR4J) are employed to simulate the daily flows and the peaks-over-threshold method is used to extract peak flows from the simulated daily flows. Three post-processing methods, namely the quantile mapping method and two generalized linear models, are set up to correct the biases in the simulated raw peak flows. Besides, a multi-objective calibration of the GR4J model by taking the peak flows into account in the calibration process is carried out. The regional climate model PRECIS with boundary forcing from two GCMs (HadCM3 and ECHAM5) under greenhouse gas emission scenario A1B is applied to produce the climate data for the baseline period and the future period 2011-2040. The results show that the post-processing methods, particularly quantile mapping method, can correct the biases in the raw peak flows effectively. The multi-objective calibration also resulted in a good simulation performance of peak flows. The final estimated peak flows in the future period show an obvious increase compared with those in the baseline period, indicating there are probably more frequent floods in Lanjiang catchment in the future.",

            "abstract": "Lake levels in basins in areas bordering northern Arabian Sea have been used to reconstruct regional paleohydrological patterns through lake-level statuses. For the early-middle Holocene, dramatic increases in regional rainfall have been proposed. These rainfall changes are commonly thought to be associated with an intensified Indian summer monsoon (ISM) and a large northward shift in the latitude of the boreal summer ITCZ over the Indian Ocean; this shift was proposed to reach latitudes as far north as the Levant. However, the ISM currently forces total summer drought not rains, in the Levant and neighboring deserts, including Arabia. The drought is due to large-scale air subsidence forced by the ISM and dries the region except in southernmost Arabia, where topography lifts air and produces orographic rain. This Arabian summer drought is assisted by increased upwelling that limits rainfall inland. How large the actual changes in paleohydrology were in the Arabian Peninsula? If not the ISM, what are the real causes of these changes? We summarize paleohydrologic information from Arabia and revisit the paleolake status of all lacustrine-like deposits and their basins in Arabia. From reinterpretation of these data and sedimentology and fauna, we conclude that these basins were occupied by shallow marsh environments, not lakes. Consequently, the paleohydrologic changes required to support restricted wetland versus lakes were much smaller. These conclusions are supported by the temporal and spatial distribution of other paleoenvironmental indicators such as pollen and speleothems. They indicate that (a) rainfall changes were very small in the heart of and northern Arabia, and (b) that these changes were only at the elevated edges of southwestern, southern, and southeastern Arabian Peninsula, where it rains at present, mainly due to orographic effects on precipitation in the presence of increased moisture supply. We propose that (a) latitudinal and slight inland impact expansion of the North African summer monsoon rains across the Red Sea, and (b) its uplifted air to southwestern Arabia highlands, rather than rains associated with intensification of ISM, increased rains in that region, producing the modest paleowetlands in downstream hyperarid basins.",

            "abstract": "Seismic moment tensor is one of the most important source parameters defining the earthquake dimension and style of the activated fault. Moment tensor catalogues are ordinarily used by geoscientists, however, few attempts have been done to assess possible impacts of moment magnitude uncertainties upon their own analysis. The 2012 May 20 Emilia mainshock is a representative event since it is defined in literature with a moment magnitude value (Mw) spanning between 5.63 and 6.12. An uncertainty of ~0.5 units in magnitude leads to a controversial knowledge of the real size of the event. The possible uncertainty associated to this estimate could be critical for the inference of other seismological parameters, suggesting caution for seismic hazard assessment, coulomb stress transfer determination and other analyses where self-consistency is important.\nIn this work, we focus on the variability of the moment tensor solution, highlighting the effect of four different velocity models, different types and ranges of filtering, and two different methodologies. Using a larger dataset, to better quantify the source parameter uncertainty, we also analyze the variability of the moment tensor solutions depending on the number, the epicentral distance and the azimuth of used stations. We endorse that the estimate of seismic moment from moment tensor solutions, as well as the estimate of the other kinematic source parameters, cannot be considered an absolute value and requires to come out with the related uncertainties and in a reproducible framework characterized by disclosed assumptions and explicit processing workflows.",

            "abstract": "Deciphering mantle flow patterns and their interplay with lithospheric motions remains a debated question. Because they are driven by density anomalies and dynamically deflect Earth's internal interfaces, such flows are expected to contribute to geoid and topography variations. By modifying the thermal structure of the lithosphere, they may also influence the subsidence of oceanic plates.\nOver the oceans, geoid undulations in a wide range of wavelengths, and regional variations of the subsidence, have been evidenced since the advent of satellite altimetry. The existence of a directional geoid fabric along the plate motions, in a range of scales up to 2000 km, has been confirmed over the Pacific ocean by a recent analysis of GRACE satellite gravity data (Hayn et al., 2012). Consistently, a shear velocity model of the upper mantle, SEMum2 (French et al., 2013), indicates the presence of low shear velocity channels extending horizontally in the upper mantle. Oriented along the absolute plate motion, they are found under all oceans.\nIn order to understand the nature of these channels, and characterize the flows at different scales below the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, we perform a joint analysis of seismic, geoid and bathymetry data. First, we isolate the geoid and bathymetry directional signal at different spatial scales using a gradients analysis. Then, we carry out sensitivity tests and compare the obtained signals to those based on seismic tomography results and different viscosity profiles. We discuss here our preliminary results.",

            "abstract": "Ultra-Low Frequency (ULF) electromagnetic oscillations, usually interpreted as standing Alfven waves, are a major candidate to accelerate electrons to relativistic energies in the Earth's Van Allen radiation belt. Electrons can promptly gain energy from ULF waves when they resonate with each other via a process named drift resonance, which is characterized in spacecraft observations by an energy dependence of phase differences between electron fluxes and electromagnetic oscillations. Such a dependence, recently observed by Van Allen Probes, has been presented as a most unambiguous identification of the drift-resonance electron acceleration (Claudepierre et al., 2013). In this paper, we revisit the same event to find that in the early stage of the ULF oscillations, the observed phase relationship appeared to be not fully consistent with the drift resonance theory. We further examine these apparent inconsistencies, to suggest that they arose from the fast growth of travelling Alfven waves before they were transitioned into the more typical standing waves. These observations, therefore, provide a rare opportunity to understand the generation, evolution, and particle-interaction of ULF oscillations in the Earth's magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "Excessive nutrient loading of freshwater bodies results in increased eutrophication risk worldwide. The processes controlling N/P transfer in agricultural landscapes are well documented through scientific studies conducted in intensively monitored catchments. However, managers need tools to assess water quality and evaluate the contribution of agriculture to eutrophication at regional scales, including unmonitored or poorly monitored areas. To this end, we present an assessment framework which includes: i) a mass-balance model to estimate diffuse N/P transfer and retention and ii) indicators based on N:P:Si molar ratios to assess potential eutrophication risk from external loads. The model, called Nutting (Dupas et al., 2013), integrates variables for both detailed description of agricultural pressures (N surplus, soil P content) and characterisation of physical attributes of catchments (including spatial attributes). It was calibrated on 160 catchments, and applied to 2210 unmonitored headwater bodies in France (Dupas et al., under review). N and P retention represented 53% and 95% of soil N and P surplus, respectively, and was mainly controlled by runoff and an index characterising infiltration/runoff properties. According to our estimates, diffuse agricultural sources represented a mean of 97% of N loads and N exceeded Si in 93% of the catchments, whilst they represented 46% of P loads and P exceeded Si in 26-65% of the catchments. Estimated eutrophication risk was highly sensitive to assumptions about P bioavailability, hence the range of headwaters potentially at risk spanned 26-63% of the catchments, depending on assumptions. To reduce this uncertainty, we recommend introducing P bioavailability tests in water monitoring programs, especially in sensitive areas.\nDupas R et al.

            "abstract": "Geophysically imaging melt beneath volcanic systems has been a long-standing goal in Earth Science. It presents the only way of taking a snapshot of the magmatic system, and thus offers clues to the eruptive potential of potentially hazardous volcanoes. Techniques such as magnetotellurics or seismic tomography have provided invocative images of the magmatic system, furthering our understanding that a volcano is not simply underlain by a small shallow magma chamber occasionally connected to the surface, but likely lies above a much larger interconnected crystal-melt-mush (CMM) zone, where most of the melt is stored before being transported to shallow depths. However, despite these breakthroughs it has remained difficult to estimate the details of melt storage; in particular the shape and amount of melt stored in the magmatic system.\nIn most settings melt is likely to retain a preferential orientation, whether through being stored as dikes or sills in the crust, or through the formation of melt bands or preferentially oriented inclusions or channels in the mantle. This will cause significant seismic anisotropy, with the amount and symmetry of the anisotropy dictated by the nature of melt segregation. Thus, measurements of seismic anisotropy offer a richer dataset than simply measuring absolute velocities alone.\nHere I will show the typical characteristics of melt induced anisotropy that may be observed in a variety of teleseismic techniques (shear-wave splitting, receiver functions, surface waves, Pn). I apply these observations to datasets from the East-African rift and other magmatic regions showing the nature of partial melt storage in the mantle and deep crust. These datasets offer the potential to better understand the storage characteristics of melt, especially when combined with other geophysical, geodetic and geological datasets such as magnetotellurics, GPS, InSAR and petrology.",

Our review draws on both data and model analysis over a 145-year period and explores how a multitude of inter-linked drivers affects process-function and practical water resource management decision-support.\nOur work uncovers key drivers, catchment responses and emergent challenges for process science and regulation, with particular emphasis on the technical challenge for catchment scientists to provide both insight and workable solutions to maintain food and water security in intensively management river basins. We discuss issues of appropriate methods for both data capture and subsequent analyses to support short- and long-term decision making, and particularly considers the importance of advanced techniques to clarify uncertainties in extrapolation of short-term observations to inform long-term goals.\nWe speculate as to future trajectories of catchment responses to current pressures, and potential pitfalls to immediate concerns that may often be at odds with overall requirements for continued use of natural resources in the future.",

In our previous work, we showed numerically that a geomagnetic jerk like variation can be originated from a toroidal magnetic field variation at the CMB and its interaction with the large-scale high electrical conductivity anomaly in the D” layer. The spatial distribution of the acceleration of the geomagnetic field, differential delay time between the local geomagnetic jerk observed in the south Atlantic and corresponding possible geoelectric jerk in the Pacific observed by long baseline submarine cables, and their jerk amplitude (difference of the secular variation before and after the jerk) can be explained if the conductivity in the D” layer beneath south Atlantic is about 104 S/m. \nIn this study, the effect of the heterogeneity on the flow in the core and magnetic field is evaluated by using a simple plane model of a heterogeneous mantle based on Buffett (1996) in order to clarify the possible influence of the heterogeneity on the input of the magnetic field at the CMB. Preliminary results suggest that the signature of the magnetic field may be detected as a stationary field at the Earth’s surface if the heterogeneity is planetary scale. It was expected that the flow had elongated structure in the direction of coordinate rotation, but the penetration depth of heterogeneity effect was comparable to the length scale of the heterogeneity due to magnetic damping in the core by the large-scale magnetic field.",

For permanganate (MnO4-) in particular, the chemistry of degradative oxidation is well established for cleaning up groundwater containing trichloroethene (TCE) and tetrachloroethene (PCE). However the long-term effectiveness of the application of this oxidant has been questioned due to the observed post remediation rebound of contaminant concentrations. To improve the efficiency of ISCO using MnO4-under specific site conditions, the technology of emplacing slow-releasing permanganate in an aquifer has been studied.\nWe have developed an injectable slow-release permanganate slurry/gel (ISRPG) by mixing KMnO4 with fumed silica in water. Ideally, the slurry/gel forms would release low concentration of MnO4- by diffusion to maintain a desired concentration level of the agent within the chemically active zone. We have investigated the properties and tested the application of this ISRPG in laboratory studies. Rheological study indicated ISRPG has high viscosity and shear thinning property. The viscosity of silica gel could be lowered by mechanical mixing thus making it easy for subsurface injection. Batch tests revealed that MnO4- was diffused from ISRPG and the gel did not disperse but maintained its initial shape. In column experiments we showed that permanganate release covered 6 times more effluent pore volumes when ISRPG was injected compared to MnO4- solution injection. We also observed TCE degradation by released MnO4-, and the remedial performance occurred over a much longer timeframe with ISRPG compared to MnO4- solution injection. In 2-D flow cell tests we demonstrated that water flows around the injected gel, carrying MnO4- diffused out from the gel and forming a downstream oxidant plume, while the gel was stationary. ISRPG slowly released low concentrations of permanganate to maintain a predetermined level of the agent within the chemically active zone.",

            "abstract": "Several processes unfold during the supercontinent cycle, more than one of which might result in an elevation in subcontinental mantle temperatures through the generation of mantle plumes. Geodynamic modeling motivated by paleogeographic plate reconstructions has indicated that subcontinental mantle upwellings appear below large continents that are extensively ringed by subduction zones. Moreover, several numerical simulations of supercontinent formation and dispersal show that the genesis of subcontinental plumes follows the formation of subduction zones on the edges of the supercontinent, rather than resulting from continental thermal insulation. However, the influence of the location of mantle downwellings on the position of subcontinental plumes has received little attention. Using 2D and 3D numerical mantle convection models, featuring geotherm- and pressure- dependent viscosity profiles with thermally and mechanically distinct oceanic and continental plates, we examine the evolution of mantle dynamics after continental accretion at a subduction zone (as occurred during the formation of Pangea). In simulations of vigorous mantle convection, we consider a range of supercontinent areas and change the upper and lower mantle viscosity contrast to determine their relation to plume formation. The results presented show that the formation of subduction zones at the margins of a supercontinent has a profound effect on mantle dynamics, and may help to explain how the sites of previous (and future) large igneous provinces were (or will be) determined. Subcontinental plume locations for all viscosity profiles show varying degrees of dependence on the location of continental margin subduction post-supercontinent formation. Furthermore, we find that changing the viscosity structure for mantle convection simulations (with similar surface heat flux) can determine the position (and number) of subcontinental plumes penetrating the upper mantle post-supercontinent formation.",

Exploiting these observations requires accurate and multi-physics – elastic, hydro-acoustic, infrasonic - wave simulation methods.\nA popular approach is the Spectral Element Method (SEM) (Chaljub et al, 2006) which is high-order accurate (low dispersion error), very flexible to parallelization and computationally attractive due to efficient sum factorization technique and diagonal mass matrix. However SEMs suffer from lack of flexibility in handling complex geometry and multi-physics wave propagation. High-order Discontinuous Galerkin Methods (DGMs), i.e. Dumbser et al (2006), Etienne et al. (2010), Wilcox et al (2010), are recent alternatives that can handle complex geometry, space-and-time adaptativity, and allow efficient multi-physics wave coupling at interfaces. However, DGMs are more memory demanding and less computationally attractive than SEMs, especially when explicit time stepping is used.\nWe propose a new class of higher-order Hybridized Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Elements (HDGSEM) methods for spatial discretization of wave equations, following the unifying framework for hybridization of Cockburn et al (2009) and Nguyen et al (2011), which allows for a single implementation of conforming and non-conforming SEMs. When used with energy conserving explicit time integration schemes, HDGSEM is flexible to handle complex geometry, computationally attractive and has significantly less degrees of freedom than classical DGMs, i.e., the only coupled unknowns are the single-valued numerical traces of the velocity field on the element's faces. The formulation can be extended to model fractional energy loss at interfaces between elastic, acoustic and hydro-acoustic media.\nAccuracy and performance of the HDGSEM are illustrated and assessed agaings classical SEMs and DGMs through two-dimensional geophysical examples, as well as the coupling between hybridized SEMs and DGMs in the same computational domain. Finally on-going extension of this HDG method for three-dimensional wave propagation phenomena will be outlined in conclusion.",

            "abstract": "The pathways of exchange of surface water and groundwater can have a significant influence on the delivery of nutrient-rich groundwater to streams. Many studies have revealed how the spatial variability of physical properties (sediment permeability, bedform structures, etc.) at the interface of groundwater and surface water can impact on flow pathways and residence times of hyporheic exchange flow. Here we explore the temporal variability of flow pathways at this interface. We focus on observations made on a study reach of the River Leith, UK but also provide evidence of dynamic exchanges at a number of other study sites. Under baseflow conditions, the study reach of the River Leith shows a predominance of upwelling of groundwater to the river, and in some sections of the reach a significant groundwater discharge zone in evident. However, from observations of piezometric heads made over a two year study period, repeated reversal of flow direction was observed during storm events. By deploying novel miniature electrode sensors in the river bed we were able to monitor the migration of surface water during these events. Penetration of river water to depths of 30cm was observed during monitored events, which support the reported reversal of hydraulic gradients. We, therefore, observed event-driven hyporheic exchange flow. The duration and frequency of such events may have significant impact on the biogeochemistry of shallow river bed sediments within this reach. Furthermore, temporal variability of exchange is not limited to such events: changes in regional groundwater flow pathways over longer time scales may have a significant impact on the location of localised upwelling; at much shorter timescales we see evidence of diurnal fluctuations in hydraulic heads due to evapotranspiration processes. We report on similar observations at companion study sites and discuss implications on the management of water quality in these groundwater fed systems.",

            "abstract": "The two main processes involved in forest ecosystems carbon balance are photosynthesis and respiration. Ecosystem respiration is determined by heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration, the former driven by microbial decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM), the latter by growth and maintenance of plant tissues. Thus it is extremely important to reliably quantify ecosystem respiration in order to estimate the global carbon budget of a forest ecosystem, namely the Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE). For the very same reason we have improved the 6.1 version of the 3D-CMCC-Forest Ecosystem Model (3D-CMCC-FEM) with both a multilayer soil Carbon dynamics routine and several modifications in phenology and littering. Bud burst phenology has been improved with a new “Nonstructural Carbon injection function” representing the quantity of Carbon destined to new leaves and fineroots growth; fall phenology has been improved with a novel physical driven logistic function to simulate leaf falling. Soil carbon dynamics throughout the Residues, Microbial and Humads pools follow a zero order kinetics equation, representing microbial decomposition activity. The sum of CO2 oxidized at each decomposition step form Heterotrophic respiration.\nThe present work focuses on the presentation of the 6.1 version of the 3D-CMCC-FEM and its validation against six FLUXNET sites representing a transect throughout the main European forest Ecosystems. The validation on about 10 years of simulation involved NEE, GPP and Reco:\n - Seasonal trends;\n - Daily, monthly and annual fluxes;\n - Interannual anomalies (annual and MJJ).",

            "abstract": "Planetary differentiation has been driven by the Earth’s giant convective system, which has been redistributing heat, volatile elements and myriad other chemical species for 4.5 billion years. A key exchange in this transport process is between the mantle and the atmosphere through the volcanic degassing of sulfur, carbon and hydrogen from silicate melts forming in the deep Earth. The speciation and mobility of volatile elements during silicate melting is modulated by the oceanic mantle’s oxygen fugacity (fO2), which away from subduction zones has long been considered uniform. However, a recent study has challenged this paradigm with new measurements of ferric iron proportions (Fe3+/Fe) in glasses from mid-ocean ridge basalts (Cottrell & Kelley, 2013). These new results suggest mantle domains containing material recycled from the Earth’s surface are more reducing than ambient mantle and contain high concentrations of carbon. The pervasive mantle heterogeneity well documented in other geochemical indices may therefore be systematically associated with changes in oxidation state\nIn this study we have produced a dataset of combined XANES, volatile element (C, S, F, Cl, H, B) and boron isotope analyses of 65 basalts from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge south of Iceland. These samples form a transect from 1000 km south of the Iceland plume to within 300 km of the plume centre, crossing into the zone experiencing the greatest geophysical and geochemical influence from the plume. Accordingly there are major changes in the isotopic and trace element composition of the basalts in this sample set, driven by both an increase in the proportion of recycled oceanic crustal components towards Iceland and a shift to a plume driven flow field. This suite of basalts therefore form an excellent test of the global correlations observed by Cottrell & Kelley (2013), where ferric iron contents anti-correlated with isotopic enrichment, with a high resolution regional dataset. By combining major element, volatile element and boron isotope data we have also interrogated the role of magmatic processes such as assimilation and degassing in influencing magmatic redox state.\n",

            "abstract": "The historic production of charcoal is an important component of the late Holocene fire history for many landscapes. Charcoal production can have numerous effects on ecosystems, e.g., through changes in forest area and structure, or through the effects of pyrolysis, charcoal and ash addition to soils. To assess such effects, it is necessary to understand the spatial extent and patterns of historic charcoal production, which has so far hardly been approached for the Northern European Lowlands.\nIn the forefield of the open-cast mine Jänschwalde (north of Cottbus, Germany), archaeological excavations have revealed one of the largest charcoal production fields described so far. For this area, we applied and evaluated different methods for mapping the spatial distribution of charcoal kiln remains. We present methods and results of our work in this exceptionally well-described charcoal production field and of additional studies on kiln site distribution in regions of the Northern European Lowlands. The large-scale excavations in the mine forefield provide exact information on kiln site geometry. Using airborne laser scanning elevation models, the mapping of kiln sites could be extended to areas beyond the mine forefield. To detect kiln sites for larger areas, an automated GIS based mapping routine, based on a combination of morphometric parameters, was developed and evaluated.\nBy manual digitization from Shaded Relief Maps, more than 5000 kiln sites in an area of 32 km2 were detected in the Jänschwalde mine forefield, with 1355 kiln sites that are wider than 12 m. These relatively large kiln sites could be mapped with detection rates that are close to those of manual digitization using the automated routine. First results for different study areas indicate that charcoal production is a so far underestimated component of the land use history in many parts of the Northern European Lowlands.",

            "abstract": "Since 2012, 60 lakes in northern Alaska have been instrumented under the auspices of CALON, a project designed to document landscape-scale variability in physical and biogeochemical processes of Arctic lakes in permafrost terrain. The network has ten observation nodes along two latitudinal transects extending from the Arctic Ocean inland some 200 km to the Brooks Range foothills. At each node, a meteorological station is deployed, and six representative lakes of differing area and depth are instrumented and sampled at different intensity levels to collect basic field measurements. In April, sensors measuring water temperature and depth are deployed through the ice in each lake, ice and snow thickness recorded, and water samples are collected. Data are downloaded, lakes re-sampled, and bathymetric surveys are conducted in August. In 2014, the snow cover on inland lakes was thinner than in previous years but thicker on lakes located near the coast. Lake ice was generally thinner near the coast, but the difference diminished inland. Winters (Oct-March) have been progressively warmer over the 3-year period, which partially explains the thinner lake ice that formed in 2013-14. Lakes are typically well–mixed and largely isothermal, with minor thermal stratification occurring in deeper lakes during calm, sunny periods. These regional lake and meteorological data sets, used in conjunction with satellite imagery, supports the wind-driven lake circulation model for the origin of thermokarst lakes. Results of biogeochemical analyses of lake waters generally show notably higher concentrations of cations/anions, chromophoric dissolved organic matter, and chlorophyll-a during April as compared with August. Dissolved methane concentrations are also much higher under ice than in open water during summer, although all lakes are a source of atmospheric methane. Interviews with indigenous elders in Anaktuvuk Pass indicate that mountain lakes are drying up. During the 2014 breakup period, 350 entrants participated in the 2nd Annual Toolik Lake Ice Classic including elementary school children, the general public, and international researchers. Ice off occurred on 23 June, and 11 people correctly guessed this day. All field data is archived at A-CADIS, and further information is at\nwww.arcticlakes.org\n.",

            "abstract": "Improper disposals of hazardous wastes in most industrial countries give rise to severe groundwater contamination problems that can lead to adverse health effects in humans. Therefore risk assessment methods play an important role in population protection by (1) quantifying the impact on human health of an aquifer contamination and (2) aiding the decision making process of to better manage our groundwater resources.\nMany reactive components such as chlorinated solvent or nitrate potentially experience attenuation processes under common geochemical conditions. Based on this, monitored natural attenuation has become nowadays an attractive remediation solution. However, in some cases, intermediate degradation products can constitute noxious chemical compounds before reaching a harmless chemical form. In these cases, the joint effect of advection-dispersion transport and the species-dependent kinetic reactions and toxicity will dictate the relative importance of the degradation byproducts to the total risk. This renders the interpretation of risk a non-trivial task.\nIn this presentation, we quantify, through a probabilistic framework, the human health risk posed by a chemical mixture in a heterogeneous aquifer. This work focuses on a Perchloroethylene contamination problem followed by the first-order production/biodegradation of its daughter species Trichloroethylene, Dichloroethylene and Vinyl Chlorine that is known to be highly toxic. Uncertainty on the hydraulic conductivity field is considered through a Monte Carlo scheme.\nA comparative description of human health risk metrics as a function of aquifer heterogeneity and contaminant injection mode is provided by means of a spatial characterization of the lower-order statistical moments and empirical probability density functions of both individual and total risks. Interestingly, we show that the human health risk of a chemical mixture is mainly controlled by a modified Damköhler number that express the joint effect of contaminant mean travel times, reaction kinetics and chemical toxicity. From this, connectivity is shown to produce a significant and non-trivial impact on risk measures. The impact of connectivity can be potentially beneficial or detrimental on the magnitude of human health risk depending on the modified Damköhler number.",

            "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that clumped isotope thermometry records the temperature of precipitation for carbonate minerals in surface and near-surface environments. However, the ability of a mineral to retain its clumped isotope signature at deeper, hotter burial conditions is still debated. Dolomite has been shown to be more robust to clumped isotope bond reordering than calcite. In this contribution we measure clumped isotopes in calcite veins from Southern Europe that have been buried to up to 7 km to test the robustness of calcite and dolomite to bond reordering.\nFirst, we analysed finely crystalline dolostone matrix samples collected in industry wells from Southwest France and buried to between 2 and 5.5 km, Results indicated a temperatures of ~40-60 °C, interpreted to represent formation in an early burial environment. By contrast, coarser dolomite crystals that are petrographically distinct from the fine-grained dolomite record higher temperatures and are interpreted to reflect a deeper, hotter phase of dolomite formation.\nPreliminary analysis of a calcite vein from a Cretaceous dolostone in Southern Europe buried to 6.3 km records a temperature of 41±3 °C; the calcite matrix around this records a similarly low temperature. This is well below the present-day well temperature of 130-140 °C.\nOur results indicate that both calcite and dolomite are not affected by bond reordering at the range of depths and temperatures investigated here. Furthermore, this suggests that clumped isotope thermometry can be applied to deeply-buried samples (i.e. >5km).",

During such events, erosion processes can shift from one regime to another upon the passing of thresholds, resulting in abrupt landscape changes that can have an important long lasting legacy on landscape morphology.\nHere we use topographic analysis and cosmogenic 3He surface exposure dating of fluvially sculpted surfaces to determine the timing of extreme flood events within the Jökulsárgljúfur canyon (North-East Iceland) and to constrain the mechanisms of bedrock erosion during these events. Once a threshold flow depth has been exceeded, the dominant erosion mechanism becomes the toppling and transportation of basalt lava columns and erosion occurs through the upstream migration of knickpoints. Surface exposure ages allow identification of three catastrophic erosive flood events about 9, 5 and 2 ka ago when multiple active knickpoints retreated large distances (> 2 km). Despite sustained high discharge of sediment-rich glacial meltwater (ranging from 100 to 500 m3 s-1), there is no evidence for a transition to an abrasion-dominated erosion regime since the last erosive flood event: the vertical knickpoints have not diffused over time and there is no evidence of incision into the canyon floor.\nWe hypothesise that the erosive signature of the extreme events is maintained in this landscape due to the nature of the bedrock, the large scale of the river, large knickpoints and associated plunge pools, and the lack of transported coarse sediment (greater than gravel size). We explore these controls with an experimental study to define the possible influence of the following parameters on the dynamics of knickpoint migration and morphology in a controlled environment: discharge, flow regime, knickpoint height and initial topographic slope.",

            "abstract": "Carbonaceous chondrites of the CM and CI groups contain large amounts of water bound in minerals, attesting to early water-rock interactions on their parent bodies. In CM2 chondrites such as the Murray meteorite the alteration assemblages mostly consist of serpentines with variable chemical compositions. Even though chondritic serpentines formed from anoxic fluids, they contain significant amounts of ferric iron. In order to evaluate mass transfers and redox processes during alteration, we performed a study of a heavily altered calcium-aluminium-rich inclusion (CAI), at the nanometer scale (Transmission Electron Microscopy and Soft x-Ray Scanning Transmission Spectro-Microscopy, on ultra-thin sections prepared by Focused Ion Beam - FIB - milling). Using x-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Fe L2,3-edges, and based on literature references and on measurements of crystallographically oriented FIB foils of cronstedtite (the mixed-valence Fe endmember of serpentine) we estimated over 50% Fe3+ in alteration assemblages. We measured higher ferric iron proportions in mixed Fe,Mg,Al-serpentine/hydroxide disordered phases than in well-crystallized Al,Mg-bearing cronstedtite. We suggest that aqueous Fe2+ was transported to the initially Fe-depleted CAI. There, local changes in pH conditions and / or mineral catalysis would have promoted the partial oxidation of Fe. Later input of Al- and Mg-rich solutions might then have destabilized the initial serpentine, yielding assemblages un-equilibrated from the structural, chemical and redox point of views, similar to the polysomatic assemblages observed in terrestrial hydrothermal systems. Here, we illustrate the usefulness of such a combined study for better understanding the processes of hydration on the parent body of carbonaceous chondrites. Interestingly, as the reactions proposed for the oxidation of Fe generate hydrogen, reduction reactions - involving carbon species, for instance - are expected to follow the ones described here. Alternatively, given the high rate of diffusion of hydrogen some degree of H2 escape may be expected too, which would have induced increasingly oxidizing conditions during aqueous alteration.",

            "abstract": "We present a conceptual framework for the diagonal orientation of the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) and South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ), based on observations of tropical-extratropical interactions, Rossby wave theory, and vorticity calculations. Wave trains propagate eastward along the Southern Hemisphere subtropical jet, with initially quasi-circular vorticity centres. In the zonally sheared environment on the equatorward flank of the jet, these vorticity centres become elongated and develop a northwest-southeast tilt. Ray tracing diagnostics in a non-divergent, barotropic Rossby wave framework then explain the observed equatorward propagation of these diagonal vorticity structures toward the westerly ducts over the equatorial Pacific and Atlantic. The baroclinic component of these circulations leads to ascent and destabilisation ahead of the cyclonic vorticity anomaly in the wave. Over the high sea surface temperatures in this region, deep convection is triggered. Latent heat release forces ascent and strong upper-tropospheric divergence, with an associated anticyclonic vorticity tendency. In a vorticity budget, this cancels out the advective cyclonic vorticity tendency in the wave train over the SPCZ, and dissipates the wave within a day. The mean SPCZ is then comprised of the sum of these pulses of diagonal bands of precipitation. These mechanisms also operate in the SACZ. However, the vorticity anomalies in the wave trains are stronger, and the precipitation and negative feedback from the divergence and anticyclonic vorticity tendency are weaker, resulting in continued propagation of the wave and a more diffuse diagonal convergence zone.",

Therefore, it is of great significance for further understanding hydrological cycle to estimate potential evaporation distribution. Reasonable regionalization of potential evaporation will help to improve the efficiency of irrigation and increase the ability of drought relief, which is of great importance to irrigation planning and management. Hence, the spatio-temporal changes in potential evaporation distribution at monthly and annual scales are investigated based on the modified Mann-Kendall trend test method and the entropy theory in the Wei River Basin. A nonparametric method as an attractive alternative to empirical and parametric approaches is proposed to calculate the univariate and bivariate probability distribution of potential evaporation. The directional information transfer index (DITI) is employed to estimate the similarity among the meteorological stations, and the k-means cluster analysis is used to classify the meteorological stations into several distribution zones with distinct features. Based on the monthly potential evaporation from 1960 to 2008 at 21 meteorological stations, the basin is ultimately classified into 8 zones with their own distinct spatio-temporal distribution features. In view of the distinct spatio-temporal distribution features, the DITI-based model combined with the nonparametric probability estimation method and the k-means cluster analysis offers a more precise classification of potential evaporation distribution zones.",

Within-slab, 10 to 100 m thick, eclogite-facies shear zones cut this section; the Intermediate Shear Zone (ISZ) follows the boundary between gabbroic and basaltic eclogites (associated with minor calcschist lenses), and the Lower Shear Zone (LSZ) marks the contact between gabbroic eclogites and the antigorite serpentinite sole. Up to 10 m fragments of mylonitic gabbroic eclogites were transported within serpentinite schists from the LSZ during eclogite-facies deformation. Metasomatic rinds, formed on these fragments during peak to early retrograde lawsonite-eclogite facies metamorphism (ca. 550 °C / 2.6 GPa), document episodic, prominent rock-fluid interaction along intra-slab, channelized fluid migration pathways associated with deformation.\nWe present new petrological and geochemical data on hydrous eclogites (talc-, chlorite-, lawsonite- and phengite-bearing eclogites) and serpentinite-derived ultrabasic schists from block rinds. Bulk-rock compositions, LA-ICP-MS mineral analyses and X-ray Cr/Mg maps of garnet and clinopyroxene demonstrate that these samples underwent significant enrichments in Mg, Cr, Ni, ± Large Ion Lithophile Elements and prominent depletions in Fe and V during eclogite-facies metasomatism. Boron isotopic data of phengite, clinopyroxene and chlorite, and antigorite suggest that metasomatic block rinds formed during interaction with serpentinite-derived fluids.\nThese compositional patterns point to focused, fluid-mediated element transfer through the subducted slab. Serpentinite-derived fluids via antigorite breakdown some 15-20 km deeper than the maximum depth reached by these eclogites thereby equilibrate with fluids derived from oceanic crust and/or sedimentary material. While slab components of diverse flavour have long been recognized to be central in triggering island arc magmatism, this example is among the first to document synkinematic, long-range, large-scale, channelized dehydration fluid flow within subducted oceanic slabs.",

            "abstract": "Greenland's main outlet glaciers have more than doubled their contribution to global sea-level rise over the past decade through acceleration of ice discharge. One of the triggering mechanisms is a reduction in resistance (buttressing) at the marine based glacier front (i.e. through reduced thickness or retreat of the floating tongue of a glacier) caused by enhanced calving or a longer-term thinning due to a mass deficit of the ice sheet. Recent findings indicate the reduced buttressing at the marine terminus is responsible for the recent dynamic changes observed in Greenland, but the controlling processes and triggering mechanisms are still unclear. Furthermore, our current understanding is almost entirely based on observations from a short-term record spanning only from a year to a decade, and is characterized by short-term fluctuations and therefore not representative for longer-term trends of several decade time scales.\nHere, we study the mechanisms controlling dynamic changes at the terminus of Jakobshavn Isbræ over a period of 172 years. The recent glacier acceleration began in late 1990s but there is evidence for glacier retreat of comparable magnitude in 1930s, when a similarly warm period occurred. To control the acceleration and retreat based on observed front positions during 1840-2012, we use an ocean model modifier that implements forcing at the ocean boundary using melange back pressure offsets. The mean temperature anomaly in west Greenland, the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) winter index and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) index anomalies for the period 1900-2012 sustain our modelling results. The modelled surface elevation changes near the front are considered and compared with observed surface elevation changes for the period 1880-2012. Furthermore, the modelled mass loss signal between 1997-2012 is validated based on ice mass change observations which we estimate using altimeter surveys from NASA's ATM flights during 1997-2012 supplemented with high-resolution Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) data during 2003-2009 and Land, Vegetation and Ice Sensor (LVIS) data during 2007-2012.\nOur choice of ice sheet model comprises the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) and a continuous 172 years reconstruction of surface mass balance and its sub-components (Box, 2013).",

We give an overview of different model concepts that are used to describe this process. These range from non-isothermal two-phase flow two-component transport in the porous medium that is coupled with one-phase flow two-component transport in the free air to isothermal water flow in the porous with upper boundary conditions defined by a potential evaporation flux when available energy and transfer to the free air flow are limiting or by a critical threshold water pressure when soil water availability is limiting. The latter approach corresponds with the classical Richards equation with mixed boundary conditions. We formulated the different equations and identified assumptions behind simplified forms. Conditions for which lateral and up and downward air flow in the porous medium and vapor diffusion in the pore space play an important role were identified using simulations for a set of scenarios. When comparing cumulative evaporation fluxes from initially wet soil profiles, only small differences between the different models were found. The effect of vapor flow in the porous medium on cumulative evaporation could be evaluated using the desorptivity, Sevap, which represents a weighted average of liquid and vapor diffusivity over the range of soil water contents between the soil surface water content and the initial soil water content. Vapor flow influences the shape of the moisture front close to the soil surface. Simulated evaporation fluxes under dynamic forcing, e.g. due to diurnal variations in net radiation, differed considerably between the models. Experimental methods that allow monitoring of diurnal evaporation fluxes are therefore essential for model discrimination and parameterization.",

The Swarm satellite magnetic data have higher resolution (to 200km wavelength) and accuracy than previous satellite missions, which makes them complimentary to airborne magnetic surveys.\nHowever, calculations at satellite level require a spherical modeling approach. We present newly developed software for magnetic field modeling that allows a fast calculation of the crustal magnetic field. The crustal model is represented as a set of spherical prisms, tesseroids. In our setup, we can model both the direction and amplitude of the inducing field and its temporal variations. Synthetic models, global and local tests using the geometry of CRUST1.0, show that our modeling approach leads to similar results as previous applied modeling techniques (global or local), but have a higher precision.\nThis approach is applied to the area of the Fennoscandian shield and the NE Atlantic. For the Fennoscandian shield remanent magnetization has been proposed as strong source for the magnetic anomalies on a regional scale. We want to validate the effect of induced and remanent magnetization in magnetic data at the height of satellites and airborne surveys. An important outcome of this combined view is a better understanding of the deepest magnetic sources in the lithosphere and the related thermal boundaries (e.g. Curie temperature). As the first example of this approach, we are going to show an initial model based on petrophysical maps of the region (susceptibility and total magnetization) and how the susceptibility distribution in deep crustal layers may affect the observed field.",

For tens of years, people have made great effort studying the existence and the characters of mantle discontinuities and have already had much understanding about the mantle discontinuities. And thanks to the advent of high-density network, we are now possible to scrutinize some parts of the earth with more data and get more specific results.\nIn our research, transverse component SS precursors are used to map the topography of the 410- and 660-km discontinuities.

We also measure SdS-SS traveltime residual from stacked waveforms and calculate finite-frequency sensitivity kernels to invert for the topography of 410 km and 660 km discontinuities. We use data from IRIS, ORFEUS and F-net and get more than 60,000 bounce points globally.

            "abstract": "West Africa undergoes a big change since the years 1970-1990, characterized by very low precipitation amounts, leading to low stream flows in river basins, except in the Sahelian region where the impact of human activities where pointed out to justify the substantial increase of floods in some catchments. More recently, studies showed an increase in the frequency of intense rainfall events, and according to observations made over the region, increase of flood events is also noticeable during the rainy season. Therefore, the assumption of stationarity on flood events is questionable and the reliability of flood evolution and climatic patterns is justified.\nIn this work, we analyzed the trends of floods events for several catchments in the Sahelian and Sudanian regions of Burkina Faso. We used thirteen tributaries of large river basins (Niger, Nakambe, Mouhoun, Comoé) for which daily rainfall and flow data were collected from national hydrological and meteorological services of the country.\nWe used Mann–Kendall and Pettitt tests to detect trends and break points in the annual time series of 8 rainfall indices and the annual maximum discharge records. We compare the trends of precipitation indices and flood size records to analyze the possible causality link between floods size and rainfall pattern. We also analyze the stationary of the frequency of flood exceeding the ten year return period level. The samples were extracted by a Peak over threshold method and the quantification of change in flood frequency was assessed by using a test developed by Lang M. (1995).\nThe results exhibit two principal behaviors. Generally speaking, no trend is detected on catchments annual maximum discharge, but positive break points are pointed out in a group of three right bank tributaries of the Niger river that are located in the sahelian region between 300mm to 650mm. These same catchments show as well an increase of the yearly number of flood greater than the ten year flood since 1980. However, there is no consistency between rain fall pattern and flood size pattern in the entire region.",

            "abstract": "Large-scale planetary or stellar magnetic fields generated by a dynamo effect are mostly attributed to flows forced by buoyancy forces in electrically conducting fluid layers. However, large-scale, turbulent flows may also be driven by the combined action of boundary topography (i.e. departure from spherical geometry), and mechanical forcings (e.g. libration, tides). This has been previously proposed to explain the magnetic data we have on the star τ-boo, Mars, or the early Moon.\nIn this work, we use theoretical analysis and global magneto-hydrodynamic simulations to show, for the first time, that:\n(i) the tidal forcing can generate a (dipole-dominated) large-scale magnetic field in global simulations, an hypothesis previously assumed by Le Bars et al. (2011) in their model of lunar magnetic history.\n(ii) latitudinal libration (i.e. an oscillation of the figure axis with respect to the mean rotation axis) can excite inertial instabilities, which may have driven dynamos in telluric bodies such as the Early Moon.\nWe discuss our results in the light of magnetic observations. In particular, we propose here a new possible mechanism for the early Moon dynamo, based on latitudinal libration driven instabilities. This new scenario is evaluated by comparing the associated estimates of the surface magnetic field strength with the recent paleo-magnetic lunar measurements.",

            "abstract": "Dust storms are common events, and one of the most important manifestations of desertification occurring in the drylands of Middle Asia. This area is characterized by strong winds, scarcity of vegetation cover, continental and Mediterranean type of climate with long dry summers, frequent soil and atmospheric droughts, susceptibility of soils to erosion – all these serves as a basis for formation of dust storms (DS). Additionally to the natural pre-conditions of dust storms development, the large-scale anthropogenic land cover and land use changes favor development of DS in this region. The drastic desiccation of the Aral Sea led to the intensive development of desertification processes and formation of a new desert, the Aralkum. The temporal and spatial distribution of DS for three periods: 1936-1960, 1936-1980, and 1970-2005, based on the data from meteorological network, showed decrease in DS frequency and changes in the source areas. Temperature and rainfall trends also showed significant changes across the region. At the same time in the last few decades the dried bottom of the Aral Sea became the new “hot spot” of dust and salt storms. Dust storms and their source areas have been determined and analyzed by the NOAA AVHRR, TOMS and OMI models. The analysis showed that the Aralkum Desert is one of the most active dust sources in the region, responsible for high aerosol concentrations in the atmosphere. Dust plumes that sweep up from the dried bottom of the Aral Sea have become larger, and dust storms have become more powerful, since the bottom exposure. The land-cover changes in the dried bottom of the Aral Sea were determined by Landsat TM images for 1987 and 2009. The monitoring algorithm have been developed and validated by ground truth data. The main change occurred in the land cover of the dried bottom was the considerable reduction of vegetation and small water bodies, while the areas of solonchaks (salty pans) and sandy massifs increased significantly.",

            "abstract": "Dynamic carbon processes within a seasonal forecast system serve as an additional degree of freedom in the system and thus may have important impacts on forecast skill. Skill may be enhanced, for example, though knowledge of vegetation state (e.g., LAI) at the start of the forecast; vegetation that starts off in a relatively lush or relatively barren state (compared to other years) may stay in that state into the forecast period, with concommitant effects on forecasted meteorology. In addition, the ability of soil moisture and vegetation phenology to evolve together may amplify the impacts of soil moisture initialization, known to be a contributor to skill. We examine these effects with three separate ensembles of forecasts, each covering 63 boreal summers: (1) an ensemble of forecasts in which carbon states (including LAI) are initialized realistically ; (2) an ensemble of forecasts in which the dynamic phenology model operates as in (1), but the carbon states are initialized to the same nominal values on each forecast start date; and (3) an ensemble in which phenology is not a degree of freedom at all in the system, i.e., an ensemble with prescribed climatological seasonal cycles of LAI. Evaluating the seasonal forecasts of temperature and precipitation in each ensemble against observations -- as well as quantifying the inherent predictability of these variables within each ensemble -- provides a clear picture of the contribution of dynamic phenology to seasonal prediction.",

            "abstract": "The CMIP5/IPCC (AR5) projections of climate change showed the temperatures should increase by between 1.3 °C and 4.4 °C by 2100 and the sea level rise between 26 cm and 82 cm on average. Superimposed on these climatic and hydrologic trends associated with the RCP 8.5 most pessimistic scenario, it is important to investigate the possible effect of an abrupt event like an ice-sheet surge.\nThis is first justified by the recent collapse of the Larsen B ice shelf which illustrates that a non-linear response of the cryosphere may occur in a warming world. Furthermore, in glacial periods, ice-sheets have been unstable and huge surges of icebergs did occur and deeply modified the climate. The aim of this presentation is to show the hypothetical climatic consequences of such a Heinrich-type event on future climate change.\nTo achieve this goal, 3 scenarios of rapid ice-sheet deglaciation have been designed, corresponding to an additional sea level rise of around 3 m :\n- S1 corresponds to a contribution from Greenland only;\n- S2 from West-Antarctica only;\n- S3 from both ice-sheets.\nWe use the global atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (OAGCM) IPSL-CM5A-LR. The freshwater perturbation is applied near the ice-sheet(s) during 20 years from 2050 to 2070 during an RCP8.5 perturbation. The RCP8.5 scenario is then continued until 2100 (without freshwater).\nFor these types of scenarios, previous experiments for paleoclimatic cases help us diagnose the most vulnerable areas. The North Atlantic and the collapse of thermohaline circulation is one key issue, but far field teleconnections with the Asian monsoon will also be explored. We will investigate the timing and amplitude of the climate impacts due to the perturbations, which may be quite different in our 3 scenarios.\nThese abrupt events consequences can be important for the populations and the consideration of rapid changes should improve the reliability of IPCC predictions.",

            "abstract": "The Red Sea is a semi-enclosed basin and exchanges water with the Gulf of Aden through the strait of Bab-el-Mandeb at the southern part of the sea. Its circulation is affected by the Indian Monsoon through its connection via the Gulf of Aden. Two distinctive (in summer and in winter) seasonal signals represent the water exchange. To understand the seasonal mass changes in the Red Sea, estimates of the mass changes based on two geodetic techniques are presented: from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). The GRACE solutions were truncated up to spherical harmonic degree and order degree 60 to estimate the average monthly mass change in the atmosphere and ocean from models (several hours). GNSS solution is based on observations from four stations along the Red Sea that have been acquired in continuous mode starting in 2007 (having at least 5 years’ data-span). The time series analysis of the observed GNSS vertical deformation of these sites has been analyzed. The results revealed that the GNSS observed vertical loading agrees with the atmospheric loading (ATML) assuming that the hydrological signal along the costs of the Red sea is negligible. Computed values of daily vertical atmospheric loading using the NCEP surface pressure data (Inverted Barometer IB) for the 4 stations for 2003 until 2013 are provided. Comparison of the GRACE and GNSS solutions has shown significant annual mass variations in the Red Sea (about 15 cm annual amplitude). After removing the atmospheric effect (ATML), the ocean loading can be observed by GNSS and GRACE estimates in the Red Sea.",

Here we consider the E Mediterranean region of plate interaction. We use DEFNODE software to develop block models and estimate slip rates on major faults and strain of some blocks. The wrms of residual velocities from our new model is 1.3 mm/yr. We identify small E-W extension within the newly defined Anatolian block confined to a 100-200 km wide zone south of the North Anatolian Fault (NAF) reaching 2-3 mm/yr with rates increasing towards the west. Possible causes we consider include, un-modeled postseismic effects of the 1999 Izmit/Duzce earthquake sequence, continuing post-seismic effects of the 20th Century sequence of M>7 earthquakes, and/or toroidal sub-lithospheric flow towards the subducting Hellenic slab. The overall strain rate of the Marmara Sea block is dominantly N-S extension, and the Van block, N-S compression. Present slip rates along the NAF increase from E to W, 22-24 mm/yr along the E to E-central segment and 27-28 mm/yr along the W segment. We quantify extension in the G. of Corinth, central Greece, and G. of Evia; the W, central and E sections of the Hellenic Trench are shortening with extension in the back-arc. The W Hellenic Trench and W Peloponnese have right-lateral strike-slip and the E Hellenic Trench, left-lateral ss. N-S extension (2-4 mm/yr) in N Greece and the N Aegean Sea extends at least to 42°N. Arabia-Sinai left-lateral motion across the Dead Sea Fault is ~5 mm/yr along the S segment; significant residual velocities along the N and S segments indicate lower slip rates in the N and require fault segmentation to account for slip rate variations along strike. We identify E-W contraction of the Arabian (Persian) Gulf (~3-5 mm/yr) that extends into the E part of the Arabian Plate. We will quantify and present these and other observed deformation patterns and discuss their tectonic implications.",

            "abstract": "Numerical models of floodplain dynamics often use a simplified 1D description of flow hydraulics and sediment transport that cannot fully account for differential friction between vegetated banks and low friction in the main channel. Key parameters of such models are the friction coefficient and the description of the channel bathymetry which strongly influence predicted water depth and velocity, and therefore sediment transport capacity. In this study, we use a newly developed 2D hydrodynamic model, Floodos, whose efficiency is a major advantage for exploring channel morphodynamics from a flood event to millennial time scales. We evaluate the quality of Floodos predictions in the Whataroa river, New Zealand and assess the effect of a spatially distributed friction coefficient (SDFC) on long term sediment transport.\nPredictions from the model are compared to water depth data from a gauging station located on the Whataroa River in Southern Alps, New Zealand. The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the 2.5 km long studied reach is derived from a 2010 LiDAR acquisition with 2 m resolution and an interpolated bathymetry. The several large floods experienced by this river during 2010 allow us to access water depth for a wide range of possible river discharges and to retrieve the scaling between these two parameters. The high resolution DEM used has a non-negligible part of submerged bathymetry that airborne LiDAR was not able to capture. Bathymetry can be reconstructed by interpolation methods that introduce several uncertainties concerning water depth predictions. We address these uncertainties inherent to the interpolation using a simplified channel with a geometry (slope and width) similar to the Whataroa river. We then explore the effect of a SDFC on velocity pattern, water depth and sediment transport capacity and discuss its relevance on long term predictions of sediment transport and channel morphodynamics.",

Using ab-initio molecular dynamics we have studied the equation of state and thermodynamic properties of pure liquid iron at the conditions of Mercury’s deep interior. This work has paid particular attention to the effects of magnetism on the simulations, as changes in the magnetic moments of the atoms may affect the physical properties of iron. Initial results suggest a very gradual high to low spin transition in pure liquid iron, which is expected to remain predominantly in the high spin state throughout the conditions of Mercury’s core. We have determined thermodynamic properties such as the thermal expansion, Grüneisen parameter and constant volume specific heat directly from the calculations, such that we have also determined the adiabatic temperature gradient of pure liquid iron. This has been found to be lower than published melting curves [1,2] of iron suggesting bottom up crystallization in Mercury’s core.\n",

            "abstract": "The Wei River Basin is a typical arid and semi-arid area of the Yellow River Basin. The heuristic segmentation method was used to detect the inflection points of the annual runoff. The slope change ratio of accumulative quantity (SCRAQ) method was applied to computing the relative contribution of human activities and climate changes to the decreasing runoff in the whole basin and the basin above Linjiacun. For the whole basin, when 1960-1969 is selected as the baseline, the contributions of climate changes and human activities in 1970-1993 are 26.47% and 73.53%, respectively, those in 1993-2005 are 23.33% and 76.67%, respectively. When 1970-1993 is selected as the baseline, the contribution of climate and human impacts in 1994-2005 are 18.88% and 81.12%, respectively. The results imply that human activities are the dominant driving factors on runoff reduction, whose effect is increasingly intensifying. Furthermore, in order to verify the contribution of human activities and climate changes based on the SCRAQ method, a method based on the Budyko hypothesis was used in this paper. The results indicate that the contribution of human activities and climate change based on the SCRAQ method is consistent with that based on the sensitivity-based method.",

Magnetostratigraphic and biostratigraphic constraints provide a high-resolution temporal framework for interpretation of this record.\nPaleomagnetic analyses of archive half core samples provide a continuous record of the geomagnetic field inclination down to 847 mbsf that allows construction of a detailed site magnetostratigraphy that closely matches the Geomagnetic Polarity Timescale (Gradstein et al., 2012). A total of 87 geomagnetic reversals have been recognized in the studied succession, extending back to ~36 Ma.\nDespite sporadic microfossil occurrences in parts, calcareous nannofossils, planktonic foraminifera and radiolarians each contribute to the age model for the entire Site. All nannofossil marker species for Oligocene to Eocene Zones NP25 to NP19/20 are recognised. Beneath paleomagnetic control (847–1449 mbsf), foraminifera and radiolarians provide the only age control.\nThe most salient features of the age model are that: (i) average linear sedimentation rates during the Plio-Pleistocene range from 1.4 to 2.2 cm/ka; (ii) there was a reduction in sedimentation rates to 0.25 – 0.5 cm/ka throughout the Miocene; and (iii) sedimentation rates sharply increase again in the Oligocene to Late Eocene to a maximum of ~20 cm/ka. These quantitative constraints closely match (non-quantitative) inferences based on the lithostratigraphy of the site, with fine-grained/coarse-grained sediments dominating in periods with low/high sedimentation rates respectively.",

            "abstract": "Despite the increasing feasibility of fully-numerical simulation of wave propagation, normal mode seismology continues to play an important role: it enables the rapid calculation of exact synthetic seismograms and sensitivity kernels in 1D earth models, and permits both approximate and exact calculations using 3D models. For many day-to-day applications, the improved accuracy of fully-numerical simulations may not justify their computational costs; for other applications -- such as sampling-based approaches to solving inverse problems -- the efficiency of normal mode methods remains essential. Furthermore, observations of free oscillations provide important constraints on long wavelength Earth structure and dynamics.\nAt present, it is difficult to compute normal modes at frequencies higher than around 100 mHz, due to limitations in software available for these calculations. In order to remove this constraint (among others), and to provide the community with up-to-date software to compute normal mode synthetics in 1D and 3D models, we announce the development of the Free Oscillation Toolkit (FrOsT). In particular, we present new codes for calculating eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions in arbitrary 1D earth models, and for generating synthetic seismograms using mode summation. We also outline planned software to compute exact synthetic seismograms in 3D models, using mode coupling theory. All codes will be released on an open-source basis in due course.\nOur eigenfunction calculations rely on improved radial integration and mode-counting techniques, enabling stable calculations at high frequencies. For mode summation, we adopt the framework of generalised spherical harmonics, with a new algorithm for their efficient calculation. This formalism enables straightforward calculation of strain and rotation fields, in addition to displacement, and the use of higher-order moment tensors. Source parameter sensitivity kernels may also be readily obtained.",

            "abstract": "The late Barremian- Aptian time interval was marked by intense volcanic activity of the Greater Ontong Java Event (GOJE) and Kerguelen Plateau (KP) which induced a global perturbations in the ocean-atmosphere system including the early Aptian Oceanic Anoxic Event (OAE) 1a. Here, we present updated surface-water paleotemperature and fertility changes based on calcareous nannofossil records from the Tethys and Pacific Ocean. The detailed picture of climatic and ocean fertility variations during the Aptian, is discussed in relation to the role of volcanism. The pre-OAE 1a interval was characterized by relatively warm temperatures reaching a maximum in the early phase of anoxia under intense activity of the GOJE. Following accelerated weathering rates a short-lived (~35ky) cooling episode interrupted the major warming. Nannofossils indicate that mesotrophic conditions are associated with highest temperatures and GOJE volcanism. The last part of OAE 1a was characterized by cool snaps, probably promoted by CO2 sequestration via burial of organic matter (OM) under persistent igneous activity. The end of anoxia coincided with the cessation of volcanism and a marked cooling.\nMassive subaerial volcanism of the KP was associated with cool conditions during the late Aptian, implying the dominant effect of atmospheric CO2 drawdown via enhanced weathering, also promoting relatively high nutrient recycling. Lowest temperatures and low fertility, were reached across the interval marked by blooming of Nannoconus truittii.\nThe almost exclusively submarine GOJE triggered greenhouse conditions during OAE 1a, whereas weathering and burial of OM acted as feedback processes favouring temporary cooler interludes. Extrusion of the subaerial KP was associated with prolonged cooling, indicating that, in a global context, weathering processes might have been relatively more important than CO2-induced warming.",

            "abstract": "Folding or boudinage are commonly thought to develop due to viscosity contrasts induced by either geometric interactions or material imperfections. However, there exists an additional localization phenomenon, i.e. strain localization out of steady state in homogeneous materials at a critical material parameter (set) or deformation rate. This study focuses on imperfections in terms of grain size variations, using the paleowattmeter relationship [Austin and Evans, 2007; 2009, Herwegh et al., 2014]. We identify the parameters for bifurcation, which is the critical amount of dissipation, expressed by the Gruntfest number [Gruntfest, 1963], incorporating flow stress, the Arrhenius number (Q/RT) and the layer dimensions. We verify the robustness of the solution through a method, developed to analyze such material instabilities [Rudnicki and Rice, 1975]. The second step is to identify the natural mode shapes and frequencies of the geometric structure and material parameters, including geometric imperfections. In a third step, the eigenmodes are perturbed and superposed to the initial conditions. We then subject the composite structure to natural deformation conditions. Grain sizes within the layer relatively quickly equilibrate to a homogeneous state, which is in response to energy optimization following the paleowattmeterrelationship. Upon continued loading, localization in terms of a necking or folding instability consequently arises out of this steady state. We obtain the criteria for the onset of localization from theory and numerical simulation, i.e. the critical Gruntfest number. Boudinage and folding instabilities occur when heat produced by dissipative work overcomes the diffusive capacity of the system. Both instabilities develop for the exact same Arrhenius and Gruntfestnumbers. Consequently, folding and boudinage instabilities can be seen as the same energy bifurcation triggered by dissipative work out of homogeneous state.\nAustin, N.J. and Evans, B.

            "abstract": "Commonly, electromagnetic measurements for exploring and monitoring hydrocarbon reservoirs are inverted for the subsurface conductivity distribution by minimizing the difference between the actual data and a forward modeled dataset. The convergence of the inversion process to the correct solution strongly depends on the shape of the solution space. Since this is a non-linear problem, there exist a multitude of minima of which only the global one provides the correct conductivity values. To easily find the global minimum we desire it to have a broad cone of attraction, while it should also feature a very narrow bottom in order to obtain the subsurface conductivity with high resolution.\nIn this study, we aim to determine which combination of input data corresponds to a favorable shape of the solution space. Since the solution space is N-dimensional, with N being the number of unknown subsurface parameters, plotting it is out of the question. In our approach, we use a genetic algorithm (Goldberg, 1989) to probe the solution space. Such algorithms have the advantage that every run of the same problem will end up at a different solution. Most of these solutions are expected to lie close to the global minimum. A situation where only few runs end up in the global minimum indicates that the solution space consists of a lot of local minima or that the cone of attraction of the global minimum is small. If a lot of runs end up with a similar data-misfit but with a large spread of the subsurface medium parameters in one or more direction, it can be concluded that the chosen data-input is not sensitive with respect to that direction.\nCompared to the study of Hunziker et al. 2014, we allow also to invert for subsurface boundaries and include more combinations of input datasets. The results so far suggest that it is essential to include the magnetic field in the inversion process in order to find the anisotropic conductivity values.\n",

            "abstract": "This work shows that local-scale climate projections obtained by means of statistical downscaling are sensitive to the choice of reanalysis used for calibration. To this aim, a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) approach is applied to downscale daily precipitation in the Philippines.\nFirst, the GLMs are trained and tested -under a cross-validation scheme- separately for two distinct reanalyses (ERA-Interim and JRA-25) for the period 1981-2000. When the observed and downscaled time-series are compared, the attained performance is found to be sensitive to the reanalysis considered if climate change signal bearing variables (temperature and/or specific humidity) are included in the predictor field. Moreover, performance differences are shown to be in correspondence with the disagreement found between the raw predictors from the two reanalyses.\nSecond, the regression coefficients calibrated either with ERA-Interim or JRA-25 are subsequently applied to the output of a Global Climate Model (MPI-ECHAM5) in order to assess the sensitivity of local-scale climate change projections (up to 2100) to reanalysis choice. In this case, the differences detected in present climate conditions are considerably amplified, leading to \"delta-change\" estimates differing by up to a 35% (on average for the entire country) depending on the reanalysis used for calibration.\nTherefore, reanalysis choice is shown to importantly contribute to the uncertainty of local-scale climate change projections, and, consequently, should be treated with equal care as other, well-known, sources of uncertainty -e.g., the choice of the GCM and/or downscaling method.- Implications of the results for the entire tropics, as well as for the Model Output Statistics downscaling approach are also briefly discussed.",

            "abstract": "We modeled the electrical transport behavior of dual-pore carbonate rocks in this paper. Based on experimental data of a carbonate reservoir in China, we simply considered the low porosity samples equivalent to the matrix (micro-pore system) of the high porosity samples. For modeling the bimodal porous media, we considered that the matrix is homogeneous and interconnected. The connectivity and the pore size distribution of macro-pore system are varied randomly. Both pore systems are supposed to act electrically in parallel, connected at the nodes, where the fluid exchange takes place, an approach previously used by Bauer et al. (2012). Then, the effect of the properties of matrix, the pore size distribution and connectivity of macro-pore system on petrophysical properties of carbonates can be investigated. We simulated electrical current through networks in three-dimensional simple cubic (SC) and body-center cubic (BCC) with different coordination numbers and different pipe radius distributions of macro-pore system. Based on the simulation results, we found that the formation factor obeys a “universal” scaling relationship (i.e. independent of lattice type), 1/F∝eγz, where γ is a function of the normalized standard deviation of the pore radius distribution of macro-pore system and z is the coordination number of macro-pore system. This relationship is different from the classic “universal power law” in percolation theory. A formation factor model was inferred on the basis of the scaling relationship mentioned above and several scale-invariant quantities (such as hydraulic radius rH and throat length l of macro-pore). Several methods were developed to estimate corresponding parameters of the new model with conventional core analyses. It was satisfactorily tested against experimental data, including some published experimental data. Furthermore, the relationship between water saturation and resistivity in dual-pore carbonates was discussed based on the new model.",

            "abstract": "The relative stability of protons trapped in the inner Van Allen radiation belt is a unique signature of the near-Earth radiation environment. While the outer electron belt changes its topography and intensity on timescales of less than a day, calculations indicate that protons in the deepest portions of the inner belt can remain on drift shells for centuries. The long lifetimes for equatorially mirroring protons have never been experimentally verified because few missions traverse this challenging environment, and those that have attempted to quantify the proton flux there have faced potentially large backgrounds from penetrating protons outside the instrument field of view. Today, the Relativistic Proton Spectrometer (RPS) investigation on board the Van Allen Probes offers a background-free reference and hence a unique opportunity to compare the present state of inner belt protons with prior measurements. In this study we revisit one relatively clean, and possibly the most accurate historical dataset: a Cherenkov proton spectrometer that operated in a highly inclined 132x1932 km orbit in 1971. The OV1-20P proton spectrometer covered the energy range of ~65-550 MeV (completely within the RPS energy range), had good background rejection because of a fast scintillator coincidence requirement, but operated off of a flight battery for only 10 days. The short lifetime of the OV1-20P mission is the primary reason it did not have significant impact on subsequent studies of the inner belt. At the meeting we will report on a comparison of OV1-20P and RPS fluxes at the same magnetic field coordinates. Our 41-year measurement baseline is not anywhere near a continuous record of course, but it is rare in space science that we have the opportunity to measure a trapped radiation environment on the timescale of decades.",

Six cases of engine failures from icing were reported in 2013 at high altitudes for 747-8 and 787 Dreamliner planes at tropical latitudes (journalofcosmology.com volume 23). Lack of horizontal Coriolis forces accounts for the extreme intermittency of equatorial turbulence and turbulent mixing, Baker and Gibson (1987). Intermittency factors inferred from the available microstructure data sets were much larger than those at higher latitudes, reflecting the wide range of scales of the turbulence cascade from small scales to large in the horizontal direction. Lognormal statistical analysis implies mean values of dissipation rates are likely to be 30,000 times larger than mode values at the equator, compared to only 2000 times larger at midlatitudes. Modern stratified turbulence theory (journalofcosmology.com volume 21) shows turbulent mixing of heat, mass, momentum, and chemical species in natural fluids such as the ocean, atmosphere, and cosmological fluids is dominated by mixing chimneys directed perpendicular to vertical and radial layers of gravitational stratification by the inertial vortex forces that define turbulence. Rarely, thick columns of supercooled steam reach cruising altitudes of jet aircraft. After entering such a column, the plane is doomed.",

            "abstract": "The current European warming is expected to be associated with an increased temperature variability in summer, particularly at the daily time-scale. Such an increase would affect hot extremes and accentuate the societal and environmental impacts caused by the mean warming. Here we investigate future changes in the short-term variability of European summer temperatures using two indices that have been seldom documented so far: the variations within one day (diurnal temperature range, DTR) and the variations from one day to the next (inter-diurnal temperature variability, ITV). These rapid variations represent key issues for impact communities, in particular energy providers vulnerable to sudden surges in electricity demand. Besides, the ITV provides a measure of daily variability that is not disturbed by longer-term variations in the mean (e.g., seasonal cycle and/or a multi-year trend), whereas traditional measures such as standard deviation or variance are. We use 21st-century projections performed by 34 models of the CMIP5 ensemble under the three RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. Models are evaluated over the present-day period against the E-OBS dataset. In Europe, both indices of summer temperature variability are projected to increase, with a rather good model agreement on the sign, while uncertainties remain on the amplitude. In particular, we show that extremely high day-to-day and/or diurnal temperature variations are expected to occur more frequently. We highlight the singularity of the European area, since ITV and DTR changes do not systematically coincide over other regions (e.g., the U.S). Then we investigate the physical processes underlying these ITV and DTR changes in the CMIP5 projections. The respective contributions of the summer drying of European soils, the reduction in cloud cover and the changes in large-scale dynamics are estimated. Finally, the possibility of reducing model uncertainties through constraints emerging from both present-day trends and inter-annual variability is explored.",

            "abstract": "We investigated soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) at the outlet of a lowland agricultural catchment (Kervidy-Naizin, France) to identify the hydroclimatic controls on the seasonal and inter-annual variability in concentrations. Six years of stream data have been used, including a regular 6-daily sampling and high-frequency monitoring of 52 floods. Both on an annual basis and during flood events, distinct export dynamics for SRP and particulate phosphorus (PP) revealed that SRP transport mechanism was independent from PP (Dupas et al., submitted). During most flood events, discharge-SRP hystereses were anticlockwise, which suggests that SRP was transferred to the stream via subsurface flow. Groundwater rise in wetland soils was likely the cause of this transfer, through the hydrological connectivity it created between the stream and P-rich soil horizons. SRP concentrations were highest in the beginning of the hydrological year (period A), when the stream started to flow again after the dry summer season and water table fluctuated in the wetland domain. Thus, wetland soils seemed to be a major source of SRP. Concentrations during period A were higher after a long summer period than after a short one, which suggest that a pool of labile P was constituted in soils during the dry summer period. During winter (period B), SRP concentration generally decreased compared to period A, both during floods and interflood. This could be due to depletion of a soil P pool in the wetland domain and/or dilution by deep groundwater with low P concentration from the upland domain. Concentration during period B barely decreased compared to A during wet years, probably due to increased connectivity with soils from the upland domain in wet conditions. During spring (period C), SRP concentration increased during baseflow periods. The possible mechanisms causing the release of SRP could involve reduction of Fe oxide-hydroxides in wetland soils or in-stream processes. At the same time, SRP and PP export during floods were synchronised and caused by erosion and overland flow. In-situ monitoring of soil solution and batch experiments are currently been performed to confirm hypotheses on biogeochemical mechanisms.\nDupas R et al. Distinct export dynamics for dissolved and particulate phosphorus reveal independent transport mechanisms (subm.)",

Our research examined how bacterial communities in laboratory columns containing bioretention media responded to varying concentrations of salt exposure from artificial stormwater and the effect of bacteria and salt on column effluent concentrations. We used a factorial design with two bacteria treatments (sterile, nonsterile) and three salt concentrations (935, 315, and 80 ppm), including a deionized water control. Columns were repeatedly saturated with stormwater or deionized and then drained throughout 5 wk, with the last week of effluent analyzed for water chemistry. To examine bacterial communities, we extracted DNA from column bioretention media at time 0 and at week 5 and used molecular profiling techniques to examine bacterial community changes. We found that bacterial community taxa changed between time 0 and week 5 and that there was significant separation between taxa among salt treatments. Bacteria evenness was significantly affected by stormwater treatment, but there were no differences in bacterial richness or diversity. Soil bacteria and salt treatments had a significant effect on the effluent concentration of NO3, PO4, Cu, Pb, and Zn based on ANOVA tests. The presence of bacteria reduced effluent NO3 and Zn concentrations by as much as 150 and 25%, respectively, while having a mixed effect on effluent PO4 concentrations. Our results demonstrate how stormwater can affect bacterial communities and how the presence of soil bacteria improves pollutant removal by green infrastructure.",

Intermediate water dynamics, in particular the interaction between Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) and North Atlantic Deepwater (NADW) during the transition from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the Holocene and the connection with Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), however, are still debated widely. Several hypotheses suggest the short-term presence of AAIW in the subtropical Atlantic or N-Atlantic sourced intermediate water masses in the Florida Straits during deglacial cool periods when the AMOC was supposedly weak or collapsed (e.g. Xie et al., 2012).\nThis study provides new water mass geometry information from the tropical W-Atlantic for the past 35 ka using a multiproxy approach. We analysed calcitic tests of benthic/planktonic foraminifera from various intermediate depth locations for Mg/Ca (temperature), Cdw (nutrients), δ18Osw (salinity), δ13C (ventilation), and εNd (water mass provenance and mixing) in order to improve our understanding of the intermediate water mass distribution and variability between 400 and 1500 m water depth on millennial time-scales. First results document the southward penetration of Glacial North Atlantic Intermediate Water (GNAIW) replacing the NADW during the LGM. Furthermore our data indicate a gradual shift from GNAIW influenced conditions during the LGM to AAIW dominated conditions throughout the Holocene.",

            "abstract": "In recent decades chemists have devoted a considerable effort to automating classical wet chemistry. The instruments manufactured for analysis of a large number of samples can be categorized into two main groups—batch and continuous flow analyzers. Our technique, autonomous batch analyzer (ABA), takes advantages of previously described batch analysis and continuous flow analysis. With its simpler design, ABA is robust, flexible, inexpensive, and requires minimal maintenance. ABA achieves complete mixing of sample with reagents using a syringe and a simple mixing chamber. The system can autonomously produce a calibration curve by auto-diluting a single stock standard solution. In addition it incorporates a pre-filtering subsystem enabling measurements in turbid, sediment-laden waters. Over the typical range for ammonia in marine waters (0-10 µM), the response is linear (r2 = 0.9930) with a limit of detection (S/N ratio > 3) of 10 nM. The working range for marine waters is 0.05-10 µM. Repeatability is 0.3% (n = 10) at an ammonia level of 2 µM. Results from automated operation in 15 min cycles over 16 days had good overall precision (RSD = 3%, n = 660). The system was field tested at three shallow South Florida sites, a tidal pond and the Indian River Lagoon, FL. Diurnal cycles and possibly a tidal influence were expressed in the concentration variability observed.",

The volatile systematics of the volcanic system are well understood through melt inclusion and volcanic gas studies. Etna’s melts are generated from a complex mantle setting, with subduction-related chemical modifications as well as OIB-type features, and then the melts must travel through thick carbonate-rich crust. The continual influx of mantle-derived volatile-rich magma controls the major compositional and eruptive features of Mount Etna and magma mixing has been recognized as an important process driving large eruptions [Kamenetsky, 2007]. Our study focusses on the 1669 eruption, the largest in historical times. Olivine-hosted melt inclusions were analyzed for volatile, trace and major elements using electron microprobe and ion probe (SIMS). We use volatile systematics and geochemical data to deconvolve mantle-derived heterogeneity from melt mixing and crystal fractionation. Our data are well described by a mixing trend between two distinct melts: a CO2-rich (CO2~1000ppm), incompatible trace element depleted melt (La/Yb~16), and a CO2-poor, enriched melt. The mixing also generates a strong correlation between Sr and CO2 in the melt inclusions dataset, reflecting the presence of a strong Sr anomaly in one of the end-member melts. We investigate the origin of this Sr anomaly by considering plagioclase dissolution and crustal assimilation. We also investigate degassing processes in the crust and plumbing system of the volcano. We compare our results with similar studies of OIB and arc-related basalts elsewhere and assess the implications for linking eruption size and style with the nature of the mantle-derived melts.\nKamenetsky et al.

            "abstract": "I use GPS interseismic velocities and classic elastic half-space models with a screw dislocation to estimate the long-term fault slip rate, locking depth, and the offset between the surface fault trace and the location of the dislocation below the seismogenic zone for 13 segments along 8 major strike-slip faults. Using deduced strike-slip rates and the position of the dislocation to normalize the interseismic velocities to facilitate comparison of spatial patterns of deformation, I show that no substantial differences can be detected, ruling out a large asymmetry in interseismic velocities across the 8 faults used in this study. Only the Carrizo Plain segment of the San Andreas fault shows a significant asymmetry that cannot be explained by shifting the position of the dislocation at depth relative to the fault trace. However, the resulting perturbation is less than 10% of total strike-slip rate. Fault traces are usually curved, defining a concave side. Surprisingly, when the dislocation at depth is significantly offset from the fault trace, the shift is always towards the block on the concave side of the fault trace. This suggests that the fault zone in the lower crust may develop a simpler geometry more consistent with relative motion across the fault than its upper seismogenic part constrained by the structural complexity of the brittle crust. Since the faults used in this study are at different times in their interseismic period, comparing the interseismic velocity fields across them allows identification of possible variations of the interseismic velocities with time. When normalized by slip rate and dislocation location, all the faults show the same interseismic strain with no significant differences between deduced locking depths. These comparisons suggest that if temporal variations occur as suggested by some dynamic earthquake cycle models, they are small and below the accuracy of the available geodetic measurements.",

            "abstract": "Climate-glacier dynamics in the Himalaya are complex. Research indicates extreme local variability in glacier fluctuations and the presence of regional trends. The glaciers in the Karakoram Himalaya depart from world trends of glacier recession, as many are advancing or surging. Nevertheless, glacier sensitivity to climate change has yet to be quantitatively assessed given numerous controlling factors. We attempt to address part of the problem by evaluating the role of topography in explaining variations in surface irradiance. Specifically, we developed a spectral-based topographic solar radiation model that accounts for multi-scale topographic effects. We evaluate surface irradiance simulations over a multitude of glaciers across the Karakoram and Nepalese Himalaya and examine spatio-temporal patterns to determine which alpine glaciers are more susceptible to radiation forcing. Simulation results reveal that many Nepalese glaciers characterized by rapid downwasting, retreat and expanding proglacial lakes, exhibit relatively high-magnitude daily irradiance patterns spatially focused over the terminus region, while other glacier surface areas received less short-wave irradiance. These results were found to be associated with basin-scale relief conditions and topographic shielding. Altitudinal variation in glacier surface irradiance was found to increase during the later portion of the ablation season, as changes in solar geometry produce more cast shadows that protect glaciers given extreme relief. Topographic effects on surface irradiance vary significantly from glacier to glacier, demonstrating the important role of glacier and mountain geodynamics on glacier sensitivity to climate change. Spatial and altitudinal patterns, coupled with information regarding supraglacial debris distribution, depth and ice-flow velocities, may potentially explain glacier sensitivity to climate change and the local variability of glacier fluctuations in the Himalaya.",

            "abstract": "The fact that polarisation lidars measure a multiple-scattering induced depolarisation signal in liquid clouds is well-known. The depolarisation signal depends on the lidar characteristics (e.g. wavelength and field-of-view) as well as the cloud properties (e.g. liquid water content (LWC) and cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC)). Previous efforts seeking to use depolarisation information in a quantitative manner to retrieve cloud properties have been undertaken with, arguably, limited practical success. In this work we present a retrieval procedure applicable to clouds with (quasi-)linear LWC profiles and (quasi-)constant CDNC in the cloud base region. Limiting the applicability of the procedure in this manner allows us to reduce the cloud variables to two parameters (namely liquid water content lapse-rate and the CDNC). This simplification, in turn, allows us to employ a robust optimal-estimation inversion using pre-computed look-up-tables produced using lidar Monte-Carlo multiple-scattering simulations. Here, we describe the theory behind the inversion procedure and apply it to simulated observations based on large-eddy simulation model output. The inversion procedure is then applied to actual depolarisation lidar data covering to a range of cases taken from the Cabauw measurement site in the central Netherlands. The lidar results were then used to predict the corresponding cloud-base region radar reflectivities. In non-drizzling condition, it was found that the lidar inversion results can be used to predict the observed radar reflectivities with an accuracy within the radar calibration uncertainty (2-3 dBZ). This result strongly supports the accuracy of the lidar inversion results. Results of a comparison between ground-based aerosol number concentration and lidar-derived CDNC are also presented. The results are seen to be consistent with previous studies based on aircraft-based in situ measurements.",

            "abstract": "Plan-view curvature of geological structures and range-front topography has long been a recognized and debated feature of both ancient and active fold-thrust belts. As part of the largest active mountain range on Earth, much of the body of work surrounding this topic has focused on the Tibetan Plateau. A lack of published data, extremely limited geodetic coverage and difficulty of access mean there have been relatively few studies of the western part of the India-Asia collision zone, where the Himalaya curve to the southwest into the lobate fold-thrust belts of Pakistan. The widest of these, the Sulaiman Range, forms a strongly curved lobe with ~300km across-strike width.\nWe present observations and models of the Sulaiman Range of western Pakistan that shed new light on the evolution and deformation of fold-thrust belts. Earthquake source inversions show that the seismic deformation in the range is concentrated in the thick pile of sediments overlying the underthrusting lithosphere of the Indian subcontinent. The slip vectors of the earthquakes vary in strike around the margin of the range, in tandem with the shape of the topography, suggesting that gravitational driving forces arising from the topography play an important role in governing the deformation of the region. Numerical models suggest that the active deformation, and extreme plan-view curvature of the range, are governed by the presence of weak sediments in a pre-existing basin on the underthrusting Indian plate. These sediments affect the stress-state in the over-riding mountain range and allow for the rapid propagation of the nose of the range and the development of extreme curvature and laterally-varying surface gradients.",

A Hamiltonian model is built describing the properties of Langmuir waves propagating in a plasma with random density fluctuations by the Zakharov's equations and the beam by means of particles moving self-consistently in the fields of the waves. Numerical simulations, performed using parameters relevant to solar type III conditions at 1 AU, show that when the average level of density fluctuations is sufficiently low, the beam relaxation and the wave excitation processes are similar to those in a homogeneous plasma and can be described by the quasilinear equations of the weak turbulence theory. On the contrary, when the average level of density fluctuations overcomes some threshold depending on the ratio of the thermal velocity to the beam velocity, the plasma inhomogeneities crucially influence on the characteristics of the Langmuir turbulence and the beam-plasma interaction. In this case, fluxes of accelerated particles are observed, whose density and kinetic energy can be calculated as a function of the beam and plasma characteristics. Langmuir waveforms are presented in the form they would appear if recorded by a satellite moving in the solar wind. Comparison with recent measurements by the STEREO and WIND satellites shows that their characteristic features are very similar to the observations. Moreover, wave-wave coupling and three wave decay processes are studied as a function of the average level of plasma density fluctuations.\n",

From a 145 year-long simulation with a coupled chemistry climate model, OBP variability is found to be related to the prevailing atmospheric sea-level pressure and surface wind conditions in the larger North Pacific area. The dominating atmospheric pressure patterns obtained from the climate model run allow in combination with ERA-Interim sea-level pressure and surface winds a reconstruction of the OBP variability in the North Pacific from atmospheric model data only, which correlates favourably (r=0.7) with GRACE ocean bottom pressure observations. The regression results indicate that GRACE-based OBP observations are indeed sensitive to changes in the prevailing sea-level pressure and thus surface wind conditions in the North Pacific, thereby opening opportunities to constrain atmospheric models from satellite gravity observations over the oceans.",

Both share comparable fast spreading rates, size and their dominant source of information that is mainly geophysical in EPR and structural in Oman. In these respects, they are remarkably complementary. Mantle upwelling zones at the EPR and mantle diapirs in Oman have a similar size and spacing. They punctually introduce basaltic melt and heat in the accreting crust, thus controlling elementary segments structure and activity. A tent-shaped magma chamber fits onto the diapir head, the top of which is a Mantle Transition Zone (MTZ) that stores, modifies, and injects the modified melt into the upper Axial Melt Lens (AML) beneath the lid. This MTZ-AML connection is central in crustal accretion, as documented in Oman. Heat from the diapir is captured above the Moho by the magma chamber and escapes through its walls, into a thin thermal boundary layer that bounds the chamber. Beyond, seawater at lower temperatures feeds smokers on the seafloor.",

            "abstract": "Structure from Motion photogrammetry (SfM-photogrammetry) recently appeared in environmental sciences as an impressive tool allowing for the creation of topographic data from unstructured imagery. Several authors have tested the performance of SfM-photogrammetry vs that of TLS or dGPS. Whilst the initial results were very promising, there is currently a growing awareness that systematic deformations occur in DEMs and point-clouds derived from SfM-photogrammetry. Notably, some authors have identified a systematic doming manifest as an increasing error vs distance to the model centre. Simulation studies have confirmed that this error is due to errors in the calibration of camera distortions. This work aims to further investigate these effects in the presence of real data. We start with a dataset of 220 images acquired from a sUAS. After obtaining an initial self-calibration of the camera lens with Agisoft Photoscan, our method consists in applying systematic perturbations to 2 key lens parameters: Focal length and the k1 distortion parameter. For each perturbation, a point-cloud was produced and compared to LiDAR data. After deriving the mean and standard deviation of the error residuals (ε), a 2nd order polynomial surface was fitted to the errors point-cloud and the peak ε defined as the mathematical extrema of this surface. The results are presented in figure 1. This figure shows that lens perturbations can induce a range of errors with systematic behaviours. Peak ε is primarily controlled by K1 with a secondary control exerted by the focal length. These results allow us to state that: To limit the peak ε to 10cm, the K1 parameter must be calibrated to within 0.00025 and the focal length to within 2.5 pixels (≈10 µm). This level of calibration accuracy can only be achieved with proper design of image acquisition and control network geometry. Our main point is therefore that SfM is not a bypass to a rigorous and well-informed photogrammetric approach. Users of SfM-photogrammetry will still require basic training and knowledge in the fundamentals of photogrammetry. This is especially true for applications where very small topographic changes need to be detected or where gradient-sensitive processes need to be modelled.",

            "abstract": "Midlatitude cyclones (\"East Coast Lows\", ECLs) are a major feature of Australia's east coast environment, and are both a cause of damaging severe weather and an important contributor to rainfall and dam inflow. For this reason, several studies in recent years have presented cyclone databases developed for this region from reanalysis data, using a variety of identification and tracking approaches. However, inconsistencies in base reanalysis data and low identification regions cause difficulties in selecting the appropriate database for a given purpose. For this study, the four cyclone identification and tracking methods from recent papers have been applied to the ERA-Interim reanalysis and restricted to an identical region and similar numbers of events. This allows a detailed comparison with a preexisting observational dataset between 1980 and 2006, with a particular focus on events associated with severe weather or explosive development. While all methods are able to detect the most severe events, large differences between methods are noted in both the observed seasonality and interannual variability of ECL occurrence. This has major implications for our understanding of the relationships between ECLs and major climate drivers such as ENSO, as well as long-term trends.",

            "abstract": "Leaf wetness plays a major role in the development of fungal plant diseases. Leaf wetness duration (LWD) above a threshold value is determinant for infection and can be seen as a good indicator of impact of climate on infection occurrence and risk.\nAs LWD is not widely measured, several methods, based on physics and empirical approach, have been developed to estimate it from weather data. Many LWD statistical models do exist, but the lack of standard for measurements require reassessments. A new empirical LWD model, called MEDHI (Modèle d’Estimation de la Durée d’Humectation à l’Inra) was developed for french configuration for wetness sensors (angle : 90°, height : 50 cm). This deployment is different from what is usually recommended from constructors or authors in other countries (angle from 10 to 60°, height from 10 to 150 cm…). MEDHI is a decision support system based on hourly climatic conditions at time steps n and n-1 taking account relative humidity, rainfall and previously simulated LWD. Air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, rain and LWD data from several sensors with 2 configurations were measured during 6 months in Toulouse and Avignon (South West and South East of France) to calibrate MEDHI. A comparison of empirical models : NHRH (RH threshold), DPD (dew point depression), CART (classification and regression tree analysis dependant on RH, wind speed and dew point depression) and MEDHI, using meteorological and LWD measurements obtained during 5 months in Toulouse, showed that the development of this new model MEHDI was definitely better adapted to French conditions.\nIn the context of climate change, MEDHI was used for mapping the evolution of leaf wetness duration in France from 1950 to 2100 with the French regional climate model ALADIN under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and using a QM (Quantile-Mapping) statistical downscaling method. Results give information on the spatial distribution of infection risks during the current century. Such approach could be easily combined with thermal response curves of fungal infection for various pathogens.",

            "abstract": "Sea-level anomalies are intra-seasonal (weeks to months) periods of high water level induced by oceanographic and meteorological processes, such as reduced Gulf Stream transport strength or persistent northeasterly winds. Although flooding associated with sea-level anomalies has been documented along continental coastlines (e.g. U.S. East Coast), these phenomena are not presently included in coastal models and management plans. We present the first measurements of beach erosion after a year with frequent sea-level anomalies. Erosion during this year, which was not impacted by large storms, was similar to a year with a hurricane, indicating that sea-level anomalies are important facilitators of coastal erosion.\nBeach erosion was measured at Onslow Beach, NC (OB) in a year with frequent sea-level anomalies (2009-2010) and compared to erosion during a year with no major events (2010-2011) and the year with Hurricane Irene (2011-2012). Sea-level anomalies were identified in water level data from a NOAA tide gauge in Wrightsville Beach, NC. From 2009-2010 anomalously high sea level occurred ~40% of the time, compared to ~8% from 2010-2011 and ~10% from 2011-2012. Significant wave heights, measured from an acoustic wave and current profiler and NOAA buoys offshore of OB, were not statistically different among these 3 years. The average backshore, high intertidal, and mid intertidal maximum depth of erosion for all sites along OB in the year with frequent sea-level anomalies were ~25, 50, and 55 cm, respectively. These values are greater than those measured after the year with no major events (~13, 29, and 32 cm) and similar to those measured after the year with Hurricane Irene (~27, 49, and 40 cm). OB has high along-strike variability in barrier island morphology, thus results apply to many beaches and barrier islands. Our results suggest that anomalies are important mechanisms of coastal change and likely amplify erosion in response to accelerated sea-level rise and changes in storm frequency and intensity.",

Although the composition of the Earth's lower mantle is dominated by the (Mg,Fe,Al)(Si,Al)O3 perovskite, the mechanical properties of this phase, its microstructure, and the relative importance of the mechanisms cited above for its plastic deformation, are still a matter of debate. Given the thermodynamic conditions, both dislocation glide and climb are expected to contribute significantly to the plastic flow, however the activation energies and rates of these mechanisms are still to be determined.\nIn this study we utilize numerical simulations at the atomic scale in MgSiO3 perovskite to investigate the climb of dislocations, at pressure relevant to Earth's lower mantle. The interaction of vacancies with dislocations, as elementary mechanism for dislocation climb, is explicitly computed. It is shown to be dominated by electrostatic effects due to the ionic character of this material, and allow to give scenarios for climb mechanisms. These results give insight into the importance of dislocation creep in the rheology of the mantle.\nThis work was supported by funding from the European Research Council under the Seventh Framework Program (FP7), ERC grant N.290424 – RheoMan.",

Focus is placed on extending the understanding and prediction from seasonally-aggregated quantities, to the seasonal timing of regional hydroclimate changes and extremes. We build on skillful seasonal predictions of the regional activity of tropical cyclones as well regional hydroclimate. It is shown that mean-state errors are a key constraint on the simulation and prediction of variations of regional climate and extremes, and methodologies for overcoming model biases are explored. Improvements in predictions of regional climate are due both to improved representation of local processes, and to improvements in the large-scale climate and variability from improved process representation. The seasonal phase-locking of interannual variability, and long with predictions of intraseasonal variabilit, provide potential sources of predictability of the timing of regional hydroclimate and extremes.",

            "abstract": "Hurricane- and coastal storm-related economic losses have increased substantially over the past century, largely due to expanding population and development in susceptible coastal areas. Concurrent with this growth, the federal government has assumed an increasing proportion of the financial responsibility associated with U.S. coastal storms, which may discourage state and local governments from taking appropriate actions to reduce risk and enhance resilience.\nStrategies to manage coastal storm risks fall into two categories: reducing the probability of flooding or wave impact (such as seawalls, storm surge barriers, beach nourishment, dune building, restoration/expansion of oyster reefs, salt marshes, and mangroves) and reducing the number or vulnerability of people or structures (such as relocation, land-use planning, and elevating or floodproofing buildings). Over the past century, most coastal risk management programs have emphasized coastal armoring, while doing little to decrease development in harm’s way.\nThis National Research Council report calls for the development of a national vision for managing coastal risks that includes a long-term view, regional solutions, and recognition of all benefits. A national coastal risk assessment is needed to identify high priority areas. Benefit-cost analysis provides a reasonable framework to evaluate national investments in coastal risk reduction, if constrained by other important environmental, social, and life-safety factors. Extensive collaboration and additional policy changes will be necessary to move from a nation that is primarily reactive to coastal disasters to one that invests wisely in coastal risk reduction and builds resilience among coastal communities.",

            "abstract": "The ability of any satellite gravity mission concept to monitor mass transport processes in the Earth system is typically tested well ahead of its implementation by means of detailed simulation studies. Those studies often extend from the simulation of realistic orbits and instrumental data all the way down to the retrieval of global gravity field solution time-series, thereby requiring realistic representations of the spatio-temporal mass variability in the different sub-systems of the Earth as a source model for the orbit computations. For such simulations, a suitable source model is required to (i) represent rapid mass motions in for example the atmosphere and oceans, in order to realistically include the effects of temporal aliasing due to non-tidal high-frequency mass variability into the retrieved gravity fields. Moreover, (ii) low-frequency variability needs to present at realistic amplitudes and frequencies at in particular small spatial scales, in order to assess to what extent a new mission concept might provide further insight into physical processes not observed by a satellite system before. The new source model presented in this study attempts to fulfill both requirements: Based on ECMWF's recent atmospheric reanalysis ERA Interim and corresponding simulations from numerical models of the other Earth system components, it offers spherical harmonic coefficients of the mass variability in atmosphere, oceans, the terrestrial hydrosphere including the ice-sheets and glaciers, as well as the solid Earth with high temporal (6 hours) and spatial (d/o 180) resolution for a period of 12 years. Together with the source model, a corresponding de-aliasing model for atmospheric and oceanic high-frequency variability that is augmented by realistic errors is available for the gravity field retrieval process. Several features of this new dataset will be highlighted in this presentation in order to provide guidance for its application in upcoming future mission simulation studies.",

            "abstract": "The growing importance and successive expansion of renewable energies raise new challenges for decision makers, transmission system operators, scientists and many more. In this interdisciplinary field, the role of Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) is to reduce the uncertainties associated with the large share of weather-dependent power sources. Precise power forecast, well-timed energy trading on the stock market, and electrical grid stability can be maintained.\nThe research project EWeLiNE is a collaboration of the German Weather Service (DWD), the Fraunhofer Institute (IWES) and three German transmission system operators (TSOs). Together, wind and photovoltaic (PV) power forecasts shall be improved by combining optimized NWP and enhanced power forecast models.\nThe conducted work focuses on the identification of critical weather situations and the associated errors in the German regional NWP model COSMO-DE. Not only the representation of the model cloud characteristics, but also special events like Sahara dust over Germany and the solar eclipse in 2015 are treated and their effect on solar power accounted for. An overview of the EWeLiNE project and results of the ongoing research will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Emissions from unconventional oil and natural gas exploration in the Eagle Ford Shale have been conjectured as a contributing factor to increasing ozone concentrations in the San Antonio Metropolitan Area, which is on track to be designated as a nonattainment area by the EPA. Primary species found in natural gas emissions are alkanes, with C3 and heavier alkanes acting as short-lived VOCs contributing to regional ozone formation. Methane emissions from the industry are also a forcing mechanism for climate change as methane is a potent greenhouse gas. Recent studies have highlighted a high variability and uncertainties in oil and natural gas emissions estimates in emissions inventories. Thus, accurately quantifying oil and natural gas emissions from the Eagle Ford Shale is necessary to assess the industry’s impacts on climate forcing and regional air quality. We estimate oil and natural gas emissions in the Eagle Ford Shale using in situ ethane measurements along southwesterly trajectories from the Gulf of Mexico, dominantly during the summertime. Ethane enhancement within the drilling area is estimated by comparing ethane concentrations upwind of the shale, near the Texas coastline, to downwind measurements in the San Antonio Metropolitan Area, Odessa, and Amarillo. Upwind ethane observations indicate low background levels entering Texas in the Gulf of Mexico air masses. Significant ethane enhancement is observed between the coast and San Antonio, and is attributed to oil and natural gas operations due to the concurrent enhancements of heavier alkanes. Using typical boundary layer depths and presuming homogenous emissions across the Eagle Ford shale area, the observed ethane enhancements are used to extrapolate an estimate of oil and natural gas industry emissions in the Eagle Ford. As oil and natural gas production in the area is projected to grow rapidly over the coming years, the impacts of these emissions on regional air quality will need to be thoroughly studied.",

            "abstract": "Extensive seafloor carbonate pavements are present at water depth from 140 to 180 meters on the upper continental margin of the Bay of Biscay, 50 to 60 km away from the present-day coastline. They form at the seafloor meter-high sub-circular reliefs with a diameter from 10 m to 100 m that are surrounded by light brown silto-sandy unconsolidated sediments. All these structures are associated with active methane seeps that cover an area of 80km from N to S and up to 8km from W to E. These carbonates were sampled during the two cruises GAZCOGNE 1 (july-august 2013) and GAZCOGNE 2 (september 2013).\nThe carbonate crusts are porous sandstones, dark brown to black by impregnation with Fe-Mn oxides/hydroxides. Subseafloor concretions are homogenous light to medium grey fine-grained sandstones. The bulk carbonate content varies in the range 36-42 weight %. The carbonate mineralogy is dominated by aragonite that cements the detrital grains whereas calcite comes from the biogenic carbonates. Dolomite occurs in significant amount in a few samples. Circular cavities of 5 to 10 µm of diameter in the carbonate cement represent traces of gas bubbles; smaller holes in the aragonite crystals are due to carbonate dissolution by CO2 issued from aerobic oxidation of methane.\nThe oxygen isotopic compositions of the bulk carbonate (+1.7 to +4.5‰) and aragonite cement (-0.2 to +1.4‰) are lower than the values in equilibrium with the present-day temperature and salinity conditions. This indicates that the carbonate precipitated in mixtures of seawater and continental water, i.e. in a context of submarine groundwater discharge. The carbon isotopic compositions of the bulk carbonate (-51.9 to -38.2‰) and aragonite cement (-49.9 to -29.3‰) demonstrate that most carbon derived from methane oxidized as bicarbonate during microbial anaerobic oxidation of methane.\nThe GAZCOGNE study is co-funded by TOTAL and IFREMER as part of the PAMELA (Passive Margin Exploration Laboratories) scientific project.",

            "abstract": "With the recent discovery of many exoplanets, modeling the interior of these celestial bodies is becoming a fascinating scientific challenge. In this context, it is crucial to accurately know the equations of state and the physical properties of the constituent materials. Among these constituents, complex silicates (i.e. (Mg,Fe)SiO3 and (Mg,Fe)2SiO4) and the products of their dissociation (SiO2, MgO) are of major interest. Their metallization, dissociation and structural properties as density and temperature increase are a central issue for the modeling of the mantle of terrestrial planets or the cores of giant and icy giant planets [1].\nWe present here an experimental and theoretical study of the electronic and ionic structural properties of fused silica compressed up to 10 Mbar using X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (XANES). The results were obtained in two experimental campaigns on the LULI2000 laser at the Ecole Polytechnique. With an approach previously tested on aluminium [2], we obtained high quality XANES data at different well-controlled temperature and density conditions in the Warm Dense Matter (WDM) regime. These conditions were obtained by using two different target’s geometries in order to probe either released matter either re-shocked matter. This last technique allows us to obtain higher pressures than on the Hugoniot for lower temperatures, more representatives of planetary conditions. With this process, we can compare XANES spectra on different isotherms between 1 eV and 4 eV on a large scale of densities (from r0/2 to 4r0). Coupled to ab initio calculations, these results provide us structural information on liquid SiO2 such as the pair correlation functions or the associated Si-O bounding ordering of the system. The structural information obtained here allows us to improve the SiO2 phase diagram particularly in the so-called bonded liquid region [3] and to confirm the loss of conductivity with the increase of density already observed in previous ab initio calculations [4].\nREFERENCES\n[1] K.

            "abstract": "Water temperature, salinity, turbidity, nutrient concentrations, and chlorophyll fluorescence were measured at four sampling stations in the Yangtze River Estuary (YRE) and its adjacent sea before and after the passage of typhoon HAIKUI. The structure of the estuarine water column and nutrient concentrations changed greatly due to the typhoon, as strong winds and heavy precipitation caused offshore water intrusion into the YRE as well as increased freshwater discharge. Vertical mixing affected the water column within a short period after the typhoon passed over the area. As the wind subsided, the Yangtze Diluted Water (YDW) had a strong effect on the surface water, whereas the offshore water intrusion primarily influenced the bottom water. Nutrient concentrations in the surface layer increased significantly after HAIKUI, whereas complicated trends were detected in the middle and bottom layers. After the typhoon, the concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen, phosphate, and silicate increased by 1.14, 0.08, and 0.31 × 109 mol, respectively, relative to the values before the typhoon. Moreover, we estimate that typhoons have contributed about 118.56, 8.32, and 32.24 × 109 mol of these nutrients to the YRE and its adjacent sea over the past 60 years. The increased nutrient concentrations greatly accelerated the growth of phytoplankton, although the biomass started to decline rapidly in the first few days after the typhoon because of opposing conditions. These results suggest that typhoon HAIKUI had a profound inﬂuence on water cycling and biological production in the YRE and its adjacent sea.",

            "abstract": "Although atmospheric rivers (ARs) typically weaken following landfall, those that penetrate inland can contribute to heavy precipitation and high-impact weather within the interior of western North America. In this paper, we examine the evolution of ARs over western North America using trajectories released at 950 and 700 hPa within cool-season ARs along the Pacific coast. These trajectories are classified as coastal decaying, inland penetrating, or interior penetrating based on whether they remain within an AR upon reaching selected transects over western North America. Interior-penetrating AR trajectories most frequently make landfall along the Oregon coast, but the greatest fraction of landfalling AR trajectories that eventually penetrate into the interior is found along the Baja Peninsula. In contrast, interior-penetrating trajectories rarely traverse the southern “high” Sierra. At landfall, interior-penetrating trajectories are associated with a more amplified flow pattern, more southwesterly (vs. westerly) flow along the Pacific coast, and larger water vapor transport (qu). The larger initial qu of interior-penetrating trajectories is due primarily to larger initial water vapor (q) and wind speed (u) for those initiated at 950 and 700 hPa, respectively.\nInland- and interior-penetrating AR trajectories maintain large qu over the interior due partially to increases in u that offset decreases in q, particularly in the vicinity of topographical barriers. Therefore, synoptic conditions and trajectory pathways favoring larger initial qu at the coast, limited water vapor depletion by orographic precipitation, and increases in u over the interior are keys to differentiating interior-penetrating from coastal-decaying AR trajectories.",

            "abstract": "Numerous challenges coalesce to make Southern Africa emblematic of the connections between climate and the water-energy-food nexus. Rainfall and river flows in the region show high levels of variability across a range of spatial and temporal scales. Physical and socioeconomic exposure to climate variability and change is high, for example, the contribution of electricity produced from hydroelectric sources is over 30% in Madagascar and Zimbabwe and almost 100% in the DRC, Lesotho, Malawi, and Zambia. The region's economy is closely linked with that of the rest of the African continent and climate-sensitive food products are an important item of trade. Southern Africa’s population is concentrated in regions exposed to high levels of hydro-meteorological variability, and will increase rapidly over the next four decades. The capacity to manage the effects of climate variability tends, however, to be low. Moreover, with climate change annual precipitation levels, soil moisture and runoff are likely to decrease and rising temperatures will increase evaporative demand.\nDespite high levels of hydro-meteorological variability, the sectoral and cross-sectoral water-energy-food linkages with climate in Southern Africa have not been considered in detail. Lack of data and questionable reliability are compounded by complex dynamic relationships. We review the role of climate in Southern Africa’s nexus, complemented by empirical analysis of national level data on climate, water resources, crop and energy production, and economic activity. Our aim is to examine the role of climate variability as a driver of production fluctuations in the nexus, and to improve understanding of the magnitude and temporal dimensions of their interactions. We first consider national level exposure of food, water and energy production to climate in aggregate economic terms and then examine the linkages between interannual and multi-year climate variability and economic activity, focusing on food and hydropower production. We then review the potential for connecting areas with robust seasonal climate forecasting skill with key precursors of economic output and conclude by identifying knowledge gaps in our understanding of regional and national economic linkages in the climate and water-energy-food nexus.",

            "abstract": "Greater Lyon (1.3 million inhabitants 650 km ²), France, is subjected to recurring floods, with numerous consequences. From the perspective of prevention and management of this risk, the local authorities, in partnership with multidisciplinary researchers, have developed since 1988 a database built by the field teams, which specifically identifies all floods (places, date, impacts, damage, etc.). At first, this historical database is compared to two other databases, the emergency services and the local newspaper ones, in georeferencing these events using a GIS. It turns out that the historical database is more complete and precise, but the contribution of the other two bases is not negligible, and a useful complement to the knowledge of impacts. Thanks to the dense rain measurement network (30 rain gauges), the flood information is then compared to the distribution of rainfall for each episode (interpolation by ordinary kriging). The results are satisfactory and validate the accuracy of the information contained in the database, but also the accuracy of rainfall measurements. Thereafter, the number of flood on the study area is confronted with rainfall characteristics (intensity, duration and height of precipitated water). It does not appear here clear relationship between the number of floods and rainfall characteristics, because of the diversity of land uses, its permeability and the the types of local sewer network and urban water management. Finally, floods observed in the database are compared spatially with a GIS to flooding from the sewer network modeling (using the software Canoe). A strong spatial similarity between floods observed in the field and simulated flood is found in the majority of cases, despite the limitations of each tools. These encouraging results confirm the accuracy of the database and the reliability of the simulation software, and offer many operational perspectives to better understand the flood and learn to cope with the flooding risk.",

Zelina). The area under investigation comprises around 80.000 km² and belongs to the ‘granary’ of Russia, which is elementary for food supply of the increasing population. On the other hand inadequate and antiquated cultivation and agricultural management practices, e.g. acceptance of precipitation values of less than 250mm/year for farming, have caused ecological and socio-economic problems, e.g. degradation, desertification, and yield losses. The aim of the KULUNDA project is the development of sustainable land management policies and practices to stabilize agricultural yields and minimize the ongoing degradation and desertification processes.\nThe focus of the study is the quantification and assessment of land use and land cover change. Therefore multi-temporal and multi-sensor satellite images were used to classify the land cover and perform change detection on specific land cover classes. For the earliest acquisition Landsat 4/5 TM scenes from 1989 with a medium ground resolution of 30 m were chosen and mosaicked. The second time step is a Landsat 7 ETM+ mosaic from the years 1999 and 2000 with 30 m ground resolution. The third acquisition represents the actual situation, acquired in 2013/14 by the RapidEye satellites (mosaicked and resampled to 30 m pixel size). The three mosaics were classified with an object-based approach into six land cover classes: Cropland, Woody vegetation, Herbaceous vegetation, Water areas, Salinization & Clouds, and Settlements. Afterwards a post-classification change detection identified areas of change and no change especially for cropland and steppe regions. Final statistics were provided for districts (russ. Rajon) and steppe types quantifying the change within the past 25 years.",

            "abstract": "Local anthropogenic emissions are limited in Nevada (USA); however, data collected at Great Basin National Park (GBNP), which is located in rural eastern Nevada, indicate that ozone (O3) routinely exceeds the threshold proposed for a more stringent National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). Here, we focused on data collected between July 2011 and June 2013. For this period, the maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O3 at GBNP exceeded the current NAAQS threshold (75 ppb) 7 times. Our analyses indicate that a combination of sources including emissions from regional wildfires and urban areas of southern California as well as stratospheric intrusions and long-range transport of Asian pollution contributed to elevated O3 observed at GBNP. Although MDA8 O3 measured at GBNP was well correlated with that measured at 5 other rural Nevada sites during this period, MDA8 O3 was 3.1 to 12.6 ppb greater at GBNP than at these other rural sites which emphasizes the need for spatially detailed measurements particularly in areas of complex terrain. The maximum MDA8 O3 at these 6 rural NV sites ranged from 68 to 80 ppb. GBNP was the only rural site to exceed the current NAAQS threshold during the period considered; however, when lower thresholds were considered the spatial and temporal extent of exceedances in rural Nevada increased indicating that interstate and international cooperation will be necessary to reduce ambient O3 concentrations in rural Nevada. MDA8 O3 at rural Nevada sites were significantly correlated with measurements at urban Nevada (r = 0.64 to 0.82; p < 0.05) and rural California (r = 0.61 to 0.83; p = 0.00) sites suggesting that common mechanisms influence O3 observed throughout the region.",

            "abstract": "The saltation-abrasion model (SAM) is one of the highest-developed process models for fluvial bedrock erosion, describing bedrock erosion due to the impact of saltating bedload particles. The fundamental assumption in the model is a proportionality of the erosion rate and the energy delivered to the channel bed by these impacts. So far, the SAM has been calibrated on laboratory data, but field tests are rare. Here, we exploit the availability of high-quality field data at the Erlenbach bedload observatory to test and calibrate the SAM. The Erlenbach is a small, steep stream in the Swiss Prealps that hosts a well-instrumented observatory for bedload transport and erosion. Bedload samples can be taken during floods with automatic basket samplers and bedload transport rates are measured continuously with Swiss plate geophones, a surrogate method for bedload monitoring. The geophone plates can also be used to measure the energy transferred to the bed by passingbedload. Thus, we can calibrate the SAM by exploiting independent data on particle impacts, the energy they transfer to the bed, and bedload samples including grain size distributions. We find that the dimensionless pre-factor to the model is dependent on grain size. Predictions of bedrock erosion can be compared to spatial erosion data obtained from successive scans of bedrock slabs installed in the channel bed immediately upstream of the plate geophones.",

            "abstract": "The geomagnetic field is generated by the constant motion of the fluid outer core and varies on timescales from months to millions of years. Geomagnetic jerks are rapid changes in the secular variation of Earth's magnetic field, attributed primarily to changing flows near the surface of the outer core. Various generation mechanisms have been suggested for these rapid changes but none have conclusively explained the phenomena. Jerks can be seen in magnetic observatory records over the last 170~years and in satellite data of the last 15~years. This data coverage, spatially limited and/or temporally restricted, makes it difficult to interpret the true character of jerks at the surface or their origins in the core. This leads us to investigate what further insight we can gain from synthetic magnetic fields such as those which are described by modelling stochastic processes. Such fields are not restricted by the temporal smoothing of most magnetic field models and can better represent rapid variations such as jerks.\nWe compare the characteristics of the synthetic fields with those of observatory and satellite data and hence, finding great similarity, study the presence of jerks in stochastic synthetic fields. Synthetic jerks are seen which resemble observed jerks, occurring frequently with regional periodic variations in amplitudes. These synthetic jerks occur without related features in the large scale secular acceleration power at the CMB. The flexible spatial and temporal sampling of the models creates a means of validating the robustness of observed features in the real field, which suffer from limited sampling. Initial results suggest that the distribution of magnetic observatories is sufficient to accurately recover the large scale features of jerks. As such comparisons between jerks seen in observatory and satellite data may be drawn. We further investigate the spectral properties of jerks in the synthetic fields using spherical harmonic analysis with a view to assessing possible dynamic patterns responsible for jerk features. Such insights could help to interpret the core flows inferred from high-resolution SWARM data to understand the generation process behind jerks.",

            "abstract": "Changes in lake sediment diatom composition and tree rings have provided evidence of significant warming in the Arctic and sub-Arctic over the past 100–150 years. These changes likely have important implications for both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, as well as global carbon balance dynamics. Regional or site-level variability is less well known and may be key to understanding both the timing and impacts of change. Here we compare patterns of tree growth (basal area increment, BAI) from eight white spruce (Picea glauca) stands and diatom species composition and productivity from eight lakes located in a sub-Arctic tree-line region (59.61° N, 97.72° W) in northern Manitoba ~150 km west of Hudson’s Bay. Using change-point analysis and other time series analyses on z-score transformed records, we asked two questions. First, do composite diatom and tree records show similar timing of changes? Second, how much site-to-site variability exists within the aquatic vs. terrestrial proxy records? Analysis of the composite data suggest that changes in tree ring and diatom species are highly synchronous, with exponentially rising BAI coinciding with periods of rapid change in diatom species composition dating beginning in 1919 AD and continuing to 1950 AD, while silica influx, a proxy for diatom productivity, showed significant increases ~1880 and 1970. Comparisons of individual stand and lake records suggests a high degree of variability, in particular for lakes, in terms of the degree and timing of productivity changes, but not the direction of change. Collectively, these data illustrate landscape-scale linkages between terrestrial and aquatic systems with ecosystem-scale implications for the response of Arctic communities to climate change.",

            "abstract": "Tower-mounted RGB cameras can contribute data to the debate on seasonality of photosynthesis in Amazon upland forests and to improved modelling of forest response to climate change. In late 2010 we began monitoring upper crown surfaces of ~65 living trees or vines from a 54m tall eddy-flux tower on a well-drained clay-soil plateau. This Central Amazon site (60.2091 W, 2.6092 S) is in a large forest reserve. We deployed a Stardot Netcam XL RGB camera with a 1024 x 768 resolution CMOS sensor, 66o HFOV lens, fixed oblique south view, fixed iris, fixed white balance and auto-exposure. Images were logged every 15 seconds to a passively cooled FitPC2i with heat-tolerant SSD drive. Camera and PC automatically rebooted after power outages. Here we report results for two full years, from 1 Dec 2011 through 30 Nov 2013. Images in six day intervals were selected near local noon for homogeneous diffuse lighting under cloudy sky and for a standard reflected radiance (± 10%). Crowns showing two easily recognized phenophases were tallied: (1) massive flushing of new light-green leaves and (2) complete or nearly complete leaf loss.\nOn average, 60% of live crowns flushed a massive amount of new leaves each year. Each crown flush was completed within 30 days. During the five driest months (Jun-Oct), 44% of all live crowns, on average, exhibited such massive leaf flush. In the five wettest months (Dec-Apr) only 11% of live crowns mass-flushed new leaves. In each year 23% of all live crowns became deciduous, usually a brief (1-2 week) preamble to flushing. Additional crowns lost old dark-green leaves partially and more gradually, becoming semi-deciduous prior to flushing.\nFrom these two years of camera data we infer that highly efficient leaves of 2-6 months age (high maximum carboxylation rate) are most abundant from the late dry season (October) through the mid wet season (March). This coincides with peak annual photosynthesis (Gross Ecosystem Productivity) reported for this same Central Amazon site using eddy flux methods.",

An intact record of the CrIS instrumental performance and raw data record (RDR) has been established. In this presentation, the continuous records of some critical indicators such as noise, gain, laser wavelength drifting and many other parameters related to the internal thermal status, are presented. It is found that the hardware performance is extremely stable in the past two years and the degradation is very small. These features make CrIS a great candidate for long-term climate studies.\nMoreover, the completeness of RDR data is another advantage of taking CrIS for climate studies.

After the emission, the flux of gamma-rays is filtered and altered by the atmosphere and a small part of it may be detected by a satellite on low earth orbit (RHESSI or FERMI for example). Thus, only a residual part of the initial burst can be measured and most of the flux is made of scattered primary photons and of secondary emitted electrons, positrons and photons. Trying to get information on the initial flux from the measurement is a very complex inverse problem, which can only be tackled by the use of a numerical model solving the transport of these high energy particles. For this purpose, we developed a numerical Monte Carlo model which solves the transport in the atmosphere of both relativistic electrons/positrons and X/gamma rays. It makes it possible to track the photons, electrons and positrons in the whole earth environment (considering the atmosphere and the magnetic field) to get information on what affects the transport of the particles from the source region to the altitude of the satellite. In this study, we set-up a simulation close to the FERMI event number 091214 with a particular attention to spatial and temporal properties of electrons and positrons reaching satellite altitude. We focus on the positron/electron ratio and discuss what are the conditions to reach a value of about 20 %, as reported for this event.",

Hillslopes evolve over time by gravity-driven processes, either directly, or through the mediator of flowing water. The distribution of gravity-induced surface stresses modulates this evolution, together with substrate properties, and in interaction with external forcing. If the stress vector at the surface of the slope has a surface-normal component, the detachment of material may be eased or made more difficult. Here, we propose that hillslopes evolve to obtain a stress-optimized form wherein at the surface, the vectors of stresses are everywhere parallel to the surface, and total strain is equal along every horizontal and vertical section. These conditions yield an optimal hillslope shape. There are two solutions for this shape, which are self-similar, such that the scale is dependent on a single length parameter, the base width of the structure. We present examples of optimal hillslopes, and discuss the general implications of this paradigm.",

It is shown that gravity-wave induced variations in the neutral wind lead to plasma velocity variations both perpendicular and parallel to the geomagnetic field. Moreover, the electric field induced by the neutral wind perturbations can map to the conjugate hemisphere. Thus, electron density variations can be generated in both hemispheres which impact the total electron content (TEC) and 6300A airglow emission. It is found that the TEC exhibits variations +/- 0.15 TECU and the 6300A airglow emission variation is up to +/- 2.5% relative to the unperturbed background airglow.

            "abstract": "In an undergraduate Earth System Science (ESS) course, students learn about the processes in which material and energy move between the different earth spheres. It is critical that quantitative analysis be part of the class in order to have students understand rates and magnitudes of these processes. It is even better if the students generate the data and research questions. At Ithaca College, ESS is a requirement for all Environmental Science majors and is their introduction into earth science. The majority of the lab periods for the class are devoted to research-based exercises in which students are asked to generate research questions and working hypotheses prior to data gathering. Several exercises use a hybrid of student-generated data and information available from on-line sources such as NOAA and USGS. For example, student groups gather water data from four water bodies on the campus over the course of the semester (e.g., temperature, pH, turbidity, conductivity) while at the same time accessing NOAA climatic data from a nearby weather station. The advantages of this approach include student ownership (and responsibility) and rich, diverse datasets that can be used to answer a variety of questions. Disadvantages include the inability of the instructor to fully anticipate the results, which can make planning difficult. In addition, considerable time is required to have students wade through the data, make mistakes, and then correct the mistakes. Nevertheless, the overall approach results in a richer and more effective learning experience compared to lab exercises that use data sets provided by the instructor.",

            "abstract": "Symbioses between animals and chemoautotrophic bacteria dominate many hydrothermal vents. In these associations, symbiotic bacteria harness energy and “fix” carbon from the oxidation of reduced chemicals such as sulfide, methane, and hydrogen that are found in venting fluids. At vents along the Eastern Lau Spreading Center (ELSC) in the South Pacific, snails and mussels with chemoautotrophic symbionts have been shown to harness energy via the oxidation of sulfide. However, partially oxidized sulfur species such as thiosulfate and polysulfides have also been detected in abundance in their habitats. No studies to date have established whether thiosulfate or other partially oxidized sulfur compounds are used by these symbiotic associations, nor have studies constrained the potential role that symbioses might play in sulfur biogeochemical cycles at diffuse vent flows.\nTo address these questions, we used high-pressure, flow through incubations to study three symbiotic molluscs from the ELSC - the snails Alviniconcha and Ifremeria nautilei and the mussel Bathymodiolus brevior – at conditions mimicking those in situ. Via the use of isotopically labeled inorganic carbon, shipboard mass spectrometry and voltammetric microelectrodes, we quantified the production and consumption of different sulfur compounds by each of these symbioses. We established that the uptake and oxidation of either sulfide or thiosulfate could -to varying degrees- support carbon fixation in all three species. Notably, we also observed that some symbioses excreted thiosulfate and polysulfides under sulfidic conditions, suggesting that these symbioses are a source of partially oxidized sulfur species in the environment. We further observed spatial disparity in the carbon fixation rates among the individuals in our incubations that have implications for the variability of productivity in situ.Collectively, these data reveal that thiosulfate can support net autotrophy, and may be an ecologically important energy source for vent symbioses. Furthermore, symbioses-mediated sulfur transformations may influence the ecology of the free-living community by governing the production and consumption of reduced sulfur species in this habitat.",

            "abstract": "In a porous medium the seismic energy not only propagates through matrix but also through pore-fluids. The differential movement between sediment grains of the matrix and interstitial fluid generates a diffusive wave which is commonly referred to as the slow P-wave. A combined system of equation which includes both elastic and diffusive phases is known as the poroelasticity. Analyzing seismic data through poroelastic modeling results in accurate interpretation of amplitude and separation of wave modes, leading to more accurate estimation of geomehanical properties of rocks. Despite its obvious multi-scale application, from sedimentary reservoir characterization to deep-earth fractured crust, poroelasticity remains under-developed primarily due to the complex nature of its constituent equations.\nWe present a detail formulation of poroleastic wave equations for isotropic media by combining the Biot’s and Newtonian mechanics. System of poroelastic wave equation constitutes for eight time dependent hyperbolic PDEs in 2D whereas in case of 3D number goes up to thirteen. Eigen decomposition of Jacobian of these systems confirms the presence of an additional slow-P wave phase with velocity lower than shear wave, posing stability issues on numerical scheme. To circumvent the issue, we derived a numerical scheme using nodal discontinuous Galerkin approach by adopting the triangular meshes in 2D which is extended to tetrahedral for 3D problems. In our nodal DG approach the basis function over a triangular element is interpolated using Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) function leading to a more accurate local solutions than in the case of simple DG.\nWe have tested the numerical scheme for poroelastic media in 1D and 2D case, and solution obtained for the systems offers high accuracy in results over other methods such as finite difference , finite volume and pseudo-spectral. The nodal nature of our approach makes it easy to convert the application into a multi-threaded algorithm which could be developed at parallel infrastructure. Besides the fundamental of poroelastic modeling, we also present an efficient parallel algorithm that can be implemented on GPU; preliminary results from multithreaded implementation for various mesh sizes shows a remarkable reduction in computation time over serial implementation.",

Land ecosystems can sequester approximately one third of annual anthropogenic carbon dioxide emission. Therefore, dynamics of land sink is one of the key components to determine the future atmospheric CO2 concentration and accordingly surface temperature. The accuracy of predicted surface temperature will largely depend on the uncertainty of predicted land carbon uptake. Unfortunately, the uncertainties of future land sink predicted by Earth System Models (ESMs) involved in CMIP5 turned out to be very large. The spread of the land carbon uptake within a specific Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenario was larger than those variation between the four scenarios. Moreover, predicted soil carbon stocks by the end of this century extended to a wide range. Quantifying the uncertainties in predicted vegetation carbon and identify the causes for the uncertainties will help improve ESMs’ performance and give the priorities for model development. In this study, we evaluated uncertainties in predictions of vegetation carbon by twelve CMIP5 ESMs during the twenty-first century and explored the sources of uncertainties across the models. We found that the predicted changes of vegetation carbon by the end of this century varied quite much across the ESMs, from declining of 250 Pg C to increasing of 440 Pg C under 8.5 scenario, and from losing of 130 Pg C to gaining of 410 Pg C under emission-driven 8.5 scenario. We further investigated differences in responses of vegetation carbon to temperature and CO2 increasing among the ESMs and how much the initial state, net primary productivity and residence times of vegetation carbon contribute to the uncertainties in predictions of vegetation carbon across the ESMs. Our results have the potential to help improve CMIP5 ESMs for more reliable predictions.",

            "abstract": "The uptake of carbon dioxide by vegetation is a major sink of CO2 and a factor that will determine future climate. Some studies predict a decrease in CO2 uptake from vegetation because of a general drying of the Amazon Basin. Because of the tight linkage between water availability and plant carbon uptake, a comprehensive model of plant water use at the individual scale is necessary to build a complete carbon budget at the global scale. Foliar uptake of non-meteoric water is a common process used by plants to alleviate water stress. However the occurrence of this process in tropical ecosystems, as well as its interaction with other physiological parameters, is not well understood. We present a model of leaf water balance that includes foliar uptake. The isotopic composition of the different sources as well as the leaf water are also included. The model is tested against a series of experiments on Colocasia esculenta, under two different water availability conditions: drought and artificial dew. The artificial dew is spiked with stable isotopes of water (δ18O = 8.56 permil, δ2H = 709.7 permil) that allow us to trace the partition of dew uptake within a leaf. We create high-resolution maps of the distribution of isotopes in one half of each leaf using a Picarro IM-CRDS. The maps show a clear enrichment due to foliar uptake for the artificial dew treatment. The water in the second half of the leaf is extracted by cryogenic extraction and analyzed using both IRIS and IRMS for quality control of the IM-CRDS data. Soil water is collected for isotope analysis and water content measurement. Finally, stomatal conductance data collected every two days shows no significant decrease due to either treatment over the course of the experiment. We conclude that foliar uptake of dew water is an important water acquisition mechanism for C. esculenta, even under high soil water content conditions, and we propose guidelines for further improvement of models of leaf-scale water balance.",

Compared to the commonly used bulk transfer models, the MEP model predicted heat fluxes are constrained by surface radiation fluxes satisfying energy balance and independent of temperature/moisture gradient, wind speed and roughness lengths. The MEP model holds for the entire range of soil moisture from dryness to saturation over land surfaces. It provides the first global maps of water heat fluxes at ocean surfaces as well as at snow/ice covered polar regions. The MEP model is less sensitive to the uncertainties of model input (surface radiation fluxes, temperature and/or humidity) parameters and free of location specific tuning (empirical) parameters. Ten years of earth surface radiation fluxes, surface temperature data products from Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System supplemented (when needed) by the surface specific humidity data from Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications were used to reproduce global annual surface energy budgets. The MEP modeled global annual sensible heat fluxes are in close agreement with both previous studies and ocean content climatology (OHC) data from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, while those of latent heat fluxes are significantly lower than previous estimates. The net surface-atmosphere heat exchange according to the MEP model is consistent with the OHC data.",

While the short revisit period of these sensors captures the temporal dynamics of crops, they are not able to monitor small-scale farming areas where environmental factors, crop type and management practices often vary at subpixel level. Although better suited to retrieve fine spatial structure, time series of higher resolution imagery (circa 30 m) are often incomplete due to larger revisit periods and persistent cloud coverage. However, as the Landsat archive expands and more fine resolution Earth observation sensors become available, the possibilities of multisensor integration to monitor crop dynamics with higher level of spatial detail are expanding.\nWe have integrated remote sensing imagery from two moderate resolution sensors (MODIS and PROBA-V) and three medium resolution platforms (Landsat 7- 8; and DMC) to improve the characterization of vegetation dynamics in agricultural landscapes dominated by small-scale farms. We applied a data assimilation method to produce complete temporal sequences of synthetic medium-resolution NDVI images. The method implements a Kalman filter recursive algorithm that incorporates models, observations and their respective uncertainties to generate medium-resolution images at time steps for which only moderate-resolution imagery is available. The results for the study sites show that the time series of synthetic NDVI images captured seasonal vegetation dynamics and maintained the spatial structure of the landscape at higher spatial resolution.\nA more detailed characterization of spatiotemporal dynamics of vegetation in agricultural systems has the potential to improve the estimates of crop growth models and allow a more precise monitoring and forecasting of crop productivity.",

The goal of this procedure is to assess whether accurate precipitation forecasts reflect sound physics. We have developed an algorithm for mesoscale convective system (MCS) detection and tracking as a step toward process-oriented verification of regional climate models. The algorithm detects MCSs as contiguous regions of precipitation exceeding 1.5mm/hr co-located with 925-700hPa thickness change of <5 m/h. The latter criterion reflects mesoscale evaporative cooling. When tested with 3-hourly North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) data from Apr.-Sept. 1993, the algorithm detected 98 MCSs. Of these, 10 were determined as false alarms after comparing precipitation and infrared satellite imagery. The end result of this research will be a regional climate model configured with parameterization schemes that most accurately reproduce MCSs over the central United States and a tool which is applicable to the detection and tracking of MCSs in model output.",

            "abstract": "With amplified urbanization and industrialization during the last few decades, now more than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas. With surface particle matter (PM) concentration five or ten times higher than World Health Organization guidelines in some cities, it is very critical to accurately monitor PM air quality for global cities on a daily basis. The new version (C6) of MODIS Dark Target Land Aerosol Algorithm (MDT) provides near-daily aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals at 10km2 and 3km2 spatial resolutions, which can be used to estimate surface PM. However, initial validation efforts during DISCOVER-AQ field campaign over Baltimore-DC area showed that MDT overestimates AOD over urban areas, primarily because the bright and complex urban surface does not meet MDT assumptions. Surface characterization can be challenging and small error (~0.01) can produce large errors in retrieved AOD (~0.1), which can further lead to errors of around 5 μgm-3in surface PM2.5 air quality in highly urban areas. Here, we combined the urban percentage information from the MODIS Land Product (MCD12Q1) with MODIS land surface spectral reflectance product (MOD09A1) to derive a new urban surface reflectance relationship to be used within the MDT algorithm framework. We applied the new surface characterization to the MDT algorithm, and compared the retrieved AOD with AOD observed the ground-based AERONET network. AOD retrievals both in 10km and 3km spatial resolution show significant improvement over urban areas over the U.S. The bias in AOD reduced to -0.01 from 0.07, percentage of retrievals within uncertainty window increased to 85% from 62%. The improvement in AOD retrieval in other parts of the world is also observed but more analysis and research is required to apply these surface corrections globally. We will also present analysis on the impact of particulate matter air quality estimation over US while utilizing new retrievals as compared to existing retrievals over the urban areas.",

            "abstract": "Well calibrated hydrologic models are a necessary tool for reservoir managers to meet increasingly complicated regulatory, environmental and consumptive demands on water supply systems. Achieving these objectives is difficult during periods of drought, such as seen in the Sierra Nevada in recent years. This emphasizes the importance of accurate watershed modeling and forecasting of runoff. While basin discharge has traditionally been the main criteria for model calibration, many studies have shown it to be a poor control on model calibration where correct understanding of the subbasin hydrologic processes are required. Additional data sources such as snowpack accumulation and melt are often required to create a reliable model calibration.\nWhen allocating resources for monitoring snowpack conditions, water system managers often must choose between monitoring point locations at high temporal resolution (i.e. real time weather and snow monitoring stations) and large spatial surveys (i.e. remote sensing). NASA’s Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) provides a unique opportunity to test the relative value of spatially dense, temporally sparse measurements vs. temporally dense, spatially sparse measurements for hydrologic model calibration.\nThe ASO is a demonstration mission using coupled LiDAR and imaging spectrometer mounted to an aircraft flying at 6100 m to collect high spatial density measurements of snow water content and albedo over the 1189 km2 Tuolumne River Basin. Snow depth and albedo were collected weekly throughout the snowmelt runoff period at 5 m2 resolution during the 2013-2014 snowmelt.\nWe developed an implementation of the USGS Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) for the Tuolumne River above Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, the primary water source for San Francisco. The modeled snow accumulation and ablation was calibrated in 2 models using either 2 years of weekly measurements of distributed snow water equivalent from the ASO, or 2 years of 15 minute snow depth and snow water equivalent from the 2 weather stations within the basin. The models were then validated against 90 years of streamflow. This work demonstrates the relative value of spatially versus temporally dense snow measurements in model calibration, and the possible management benefits for collecting each type of data.",

Our approach consists therefore in working out a new numerical calculation method of the complete gravity field - gravity vector components and gravity gradients - by Gauss-Legendre quadrature using ellipsoidal mass elements well-suited for ellipsoidal shaped bodies.\nResults of Earth's gravity field calculations carried out using LITHO1.0, 1° tessellated lithosphere model (Pasyanos et al., 2014) are presented and discussed.

The shape of these particles naturally influences the distribution of scattered microwaves. Therefore, we seek to simulate ice-phase precipitation using accurate models of the physical properties of individual snowflakes and aggregate ice crystals, similar to those observed in precipitating clouds. A number of researchers have examined the single-scattering properties of individual ice crystals and aggregates, but only a few have started to look at the properties of melting these particles.\nOne of the key difficulties, from a simulation perspective, is characterizing the distribution of melt-water on a melting particle. Previous studies by the author and others have shown that even for spherical particles, the relative distribution of liquid water on an ice-particle can have significant effects on the computed scattering and absorption properties in the microwave regime. This, in turn, strongly influences forward model simulations of passive microwave TBs, radar reflectivities, and path-integrated attenuation.\nThe present study examines the sensitivity of the single scattering properties of melting ice-crystals and aggregates to variations in the volume fraction of melt water, and the distribution of meltwater. We make some simple simulations 1-D vertical profiles having melting layers, and compute the radar reflectivities consistent with the GPM DPR at Ku- and Ka-band. We also compute the top-of-the-atmosphere brightness temperatures at GPM GMI channels for the same vertical profiles, and discuss the sensitivities to variances in the aforementioned physical properties.",

            "abstract": "Although lakes are known to provide excellent high-resolution records of climate and environmental change over long periods, only few records exist from the high arctic regions. For example, only very few records exist from northernmost Greenland (> 80°N). Some of the existing records are chronologically poorly constrained or cover only the latest part of the Holocene. A new lacustrine record from a small lake (80°01’N, 22°39’W) in the Skallingen area in northeastern Greenland indicates that the region was deglaciated prior to 8000 cal. a BP. Deglaciation was probably triggered by high temperatures, but it took more than 1000 years for the lake and the catchment to stabilise. Chironomids were amongst the first invertebrates to colonize the lake. The fossil chironomid assemblage is fairly rich and comparable to other records from further south in Greenland. The pioneer vegetation in the area consisted of mosses and herbaceous plants. The only woody plants recorded comprise Salix arctica and Dryas integrifolia, which appear at around 7700 cal. a BP and 6700 cal. a BP, respectively. Maximum concentrations of chironomids, maximum occurrence of ephippia of the water flea Daphnia pulex, highest organic matter contents and lowest minerogenic input from c. 7700 to 4400 cal. a BP probably reflect the Holocene thermal maximum (HTM). A maximum of Salix arctica, which is considered a warmth-loving plant, indicates that the highest temperatures during the HTM are recorded around 7000 cal. a BP. However, the occurrence of several warmth-demanding species particularly in the early Holocene sediments indicates redeposition and implies that temperatures in the past, most likely during an interglacial period, were significantly higher than during the HTM. Comparisons with Holocene records from East and North Greenland show similar immigration histories and similar trends, with the Little Ice Age as the coldest period during the Holocene culminating about 150 year ago. Subsequent warming does not indicate environmental conditions comparable to the HTM yet at this stage.",

            "abstract": "There is a general need to understand floods in very flat sedimentary regions, particularly in the context of current climate and land use changes. While most landscapes respond to extreme rainfall inputs by increasing their liquid water outputs, very flat and poorly drained ones have little capacity to do this and their most common responses include (i) increased water storage leading to rising water tables and floods, (ii) increased evaporative water losses and, only at very high levels of storage, (iii) increased liquid water losses. We explored the relative importance of these pathways in the extensive plains of the Argentine Pampas, where two significant flood episodes took place in 2000-2003 and 2012-2013. We combined a new remote sensing estimate of 8-day surface water cover (SWC, based on MODIS albedo product), monthly terrestrial water stock (TWS, based on GRACE gravity recovery data), daily precipitation (PP, based on TRMM data), evapotranspiration (ET, based on MODIS NDVI and surface temperature data). Focusing on two of the most flood-prone areas of the Argentine Pampas (60 000 km² each) we found that in 2000-2003, SWC reached 18 and 15% in each region, while the accumulated precipitation anomalies respectively approached 500 and 800 millimeters since the beginning of the flood cycle. In 2012-2013, SWC peaked at 8 and 7% after respective precipitation excesses of 420 and 250 mm. There was a direct, somewhat linear coupling between SWC and TWS in the western region during both flood events, while significant hysteresis features in the eastern region hint at a decoupling between the terrestrial water reservoir and its surface component. The relationships between yearly SWC, TWS, PP and ET point at a surface-water-balance-driven water cycle in the east, with below-ground water storage exerting a secondary and delayed control on the somewhat rapid flood dynamics. On the contrary, a groundwater-connected water cycle is suggested in the west, where groundwater would buffer water excesses and, when water tables rise, triggers longer-sustained flood events (path (i) defined above). These two hydrological pictures are discussed, notably taking into account the reduction of TWS by nearly 100 mm between the two flood events.",

We have used foF2 data obtained from a number of ionospheric stations at equatorial region to cary out this work. The seasonal and diurnal variability of foF2 during different levels of solar activities were carried out and compared with the IRI2012 model predictions. Both the CCIR and URSI options of the IRI model were considered in the analysis. Although the two options are able to follow the general trend of the time of minimum ionization, the CCIR is able to give a better predictions than the URSI option. It was also observed that there were cases where each of the options either predicts the time of minimum ionization earlier or later than the experimental values.

            "abstract": "Despite the fact that two neighboring headlands in the Italian Southern Tyrrhenian Sea, Cape Cilento and Cape Suvero, have rather similar morphology and contouring flows, their contourite drifts were recognized, respectively, upstream the Cape Cilento tip and downstream Cape Suvero tip. Such an intriguing difference is discussed in terms of paleo-sedimentary processes induced by the interaction between large scale marine current turbulence and seafloor morphology around a cape (Martorelli et al., 2010). However Martorelli’s et al. model for contourite location - which allows only an upstream contourite location for this kind of capes – fails in trying to explain such a difference. We thus focus on the local effect of a topographic depression, viz. a landslide scar off Cape Suvero, on flows contouring a cape. By applying the classical conservation of marine water potential vorticity we find a steady cyclonic circulation over the scar, that generates a \"geostrophic cascade\" that affects contourite deposition and stability. All this intuitively reminds the current dynamics around the Galileo’s Red Spot in Jupiter’s atmosphere. We thus show that the application of the potential vorticity conservation can provide a novel theoretical tool for investigating sedimentary structures and their evolution.",

Here we investigate proxies for fresh water input and runoff in a region of strong monsoon precipitation that is a major moisture source for the east Asian Monsoon. A sediment core obtained by the IODP vessel JOIDES Resolution and a gravity core from the Alcock Seamount complex in the Andaman Sea are used to examine the past monsoon variability on the Indian sub-continent and directly over the ocean. The current dataset covers the last glacial and deglacial but will eventually provide a Pleistocene record.\nWe utilise the ecological habitats of G. sacculifer and N. dutertrei to investigate the freshwater-induced stratification with paired Mg/Ca and δ18O analyses to estimate seawater δ18O (δ18Osw). During the last 60 kyrs, Ba/Ca ratios and δ18Osw values generally agree well between the two cores and suggest the weakest surface runoff and monsoon during the LGM and strongest monsoon during the Holocene. The difference in δ18O between the species, interpreted as a proxy for upper ocean stratification, implies stratification developed around 37 ka and remained relatively constant during the LGM, deglacial and Holocene. To investigate monsoon variability for intervals in the past, single shell Mg/Ca and δ18O analyses have been conducted. Mg/Ca ratios from individual shells of N. dutertrei suggest relatively small changes in temperature. However, individual N. dutertrei δ18O differ greatly between the mid-Holocene and samples from the LGM and a nearby core top. The mid-Holocene individuals have a greater range and large skew towards negative values indicating greater fresh water influence.",

            "abstract": "The most up-to-date multi-mission, multi-instrument climatological data summary of Earth’s upper atmospheric composition comes from the series of empirical reference models known as Mass Spectrometer and Incoherent Scatter (MSIS®). Derived from over forty years of NASA satellite mission data, sounding rockets, and non-NASA ground-based measurements, MSIS has long provided a statistical data summary of upper atmosphere neutral temperature, total mass density, and the individual species concentrations of O, O2, N, N2, He, H, and Ar. These specifications are a function of day-of- year, solar local time, latitude, longitude, altitude, solar-flux, and geomagnetic activity and are obtained via an approach that uses an optimal error-weighted multi-variant non-linear least-squares parameter estimation procedure; i.e. upper atmospheric data assimilation. While MSIS continues to provide a convenient and generally reliable functional representational of historical upper atmospheric observational mission datasets, the most recent upgrade (NRLMSISE-00) was in 2001 and consequently does not include any data from the NASA Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) mission which began in 2002. Furthermore, this new generation of data has identified critical deficiencies in MSIS reference in the MLT region. Another drawback of the present MSIS is the lack of simultaneous uncertainty estimates as part of the standard model output. This presentation describes recent efforts to updated MSIS from the mesosphere to the exobase (60-500 km) based predominately upon TIMED SABER data but also utilizing other relevant satellite and ground- based datasets.\nThis work sponsored by the Office of Naval Research.",

            "abstract": "For much of the world, climate models predict significant increases in the magnitude and frequency of extreme rainfalls. As a result communities are being encouraged to identify and reduce their vulnerability to extreme rainfalls. However, climate model projections of precipitation vary greatly across models. While there exist strategies for accommodating uncertainties in climate model projections, for various reasons seems unlikely that state and local governments will use any of them. For communities that have not experienced extreme storms in recent memory, useful information on their vulnerability can be obtained by hydrologic modeling based on high-resolution rainfall data from one or more extreme storms that have occurred elsewhere in the region. This approach, called storm transposition, was developed in the early 20th century when hydrologic times series were relatively short, and is still used today to estimate Probable Maximum Flood discharges for designing emergency spillways for hazardous dams. We present examples of the use of storm transposition for evaluating extreme rainfall vulnerabilities in Dane County, Wisconsin. Our findings suggest that state and local decision-makers are very receptive to using this approach to anticipate and adapt to impacts from extreme rainfall events.",

            "abstract": "When the interacting stressors of climate change and land cover/land use change (LCLUC) overwhelm ecosystem resilience to environmental and climatic variability, forest ecosystems are at increased risk of regime shifts and hyperdynamism in process rates. To meet the growing range of novel biotic and environmental stressors on human-impacted ecosystems, the maintenance of taxonomic diversity and functional redundancy in metacommunities has been proposed as a risk spreading measure ensuring that species critical to landscape ecosystem functioning are available for recruitment as local systems respond to novel conditions. This research is the first in a multi-part study to establish a dynamic, predictive model of the spatio-temporal dynamics of vascular plant diversity in North Carolina Piedmont mixed forests using remotely sensed data inputs. While remote sensing technologies are optimally suited to monitor LCLUC over large areas, direct approaches to the remote measurement of plant diversity remain a challenge.\nThis study tests the efficacy of predicting indices of vascular plant diversity using remotely derived measures of forest structural heterogeneity from aerial LiDAR and high spatial resolution broadband optical imagery in addition to derived topo-environmental variables. Diversity distribution modelling of this sort is predicated upon the idea that environmental filtering of dispersing species help define fine-scale (permeable) environmental envelopes within which biotic structural and compositional factors drive competitive interactions that, in addition to background stochasticity, determine fine-scale alpha diversity. Results reveal that over a range of Piedmont forest communities, increasing structural complexity is positively correlated with measures of plant diversity, though the nature of this relationship varies by environmental conditions and community type. The diversity distribution model is parameterized and cross-validated using three high quality vegetation survey datasets, including Duke Forest Korstian permanent plots, Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA), and the scale transgressive, nested module Carolina Vegetation Survey (CVS).",

            "abstract": "Monitoring of soil active layer freeze-thaw (FT) dynamics is critical for studying high-latitude ecosystem and environmental changes. We evaluated the potential of inferring FT state dynamics within a tundra soil profile using combined L- and P-band radar remote sensing and forward radiative transfer modeling of backscatter characteristics. A first-order two-layer soil scattering model (FTSS) was developed in this study to analyze soil multi-layer scattering effects. The FTSS was evaluated against other sophisticated modeling approaches and showed comparable performance. The FTSS was then applied to analyzing L- and P-band microwave responses to layered soil. We find that soil volume scattering is rather weak for the two frequencies for frozen or dry soil with mean particle size below 10mm diameter. Dielectric contrast between adjacent soil layers can contribute to total backscatter at both L- and P-band with more significant impact on P-band than L-band signals depending on the depth of soil profile. Combined L- and P-band radar data are shown to have greater utility than single channel observations in detecting soil FT dynamics and dielectric profile inhomogeneity. Further analysis using available airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and in-situ measurements also confirm that soil profile heterogeneity can be effectively detected using combined L- and P-band radar backscatter data. This study demonstrates the potential of lower frequency SARs from airborne missions, including UAV-SAR and AirMOSS, for Arctic and alpine assessment of soil active layer properties.",

            "abstract": "Many waterfalls are characterized by the presence of deep plunge pools that experience periods of sediment fill and evacuation. These cycles of sediment fill are a first order control on the relative magnitude of lateral versus vertical erosion at the base of waterfalls, as vertical incision requires cover-free plunge pools to expose the bedrock floor, while lateral erosion can occur when pools are partially filled and plunge-pool walls are exposed. Currently, there exists no mechanistic model describing sediment transport through waterfall plunge pools, limiting our ability to predict waterfall retreat. To address this knowledge gap, we performed detailed laboratory experiments measuring plunge-pool sediment transport capacity (Qsc_pool) under varying waterfall and plunge-pool geometries, flow hydraulics, and sediment size. Our experimental plunge-pool sediment transport capacity measurements match well with a mechanistic model we developed which combines existing waterfall jet theory with a modified Rouse profile to predict sediment transport capacity as a function of water discharge and suspended sediment concentration at the plunge-pool lip. Comparing the transport capacity of plunge pools to lower gradient portions of rivers (Qsc_river) shows that, for transport limited conditions, plunge pools fill with sediment under modest water discharges when Qsc_river > Qsc_pool, and empty to bedrock under high discharges when Qsc_pool > Qsc_river. These results are consistent with field observations of sand-filled plunge pools with downstream boulder rims, implying filling and excavation of plunge pools over single-storm timescales. Thus, partial filling of waterfall plunge pools may provide a mechanism to promote lateral undercutting and retreat of waterfalls in homogeneous rock in which plunge-pool vertical incision occurs during brief large floods that expose bedrock, whereas lateral erosion may prevail during smaller events.",

            "abstract": "Global Positioning System (GPS) Radio Occultation (RO) allows measurements in any meteorological condition, with global coverage, high vertical resolution, and high accuracy. With more than 13 years of data availability, RO also became a fundamental tool for studying climate change. We present here the application of RO for detecting and monitoring tropical cyclones (TCs), deep convective systems (CSs) and volcanic ash clouds (ACs).Deep CSs and TCs play a fundamental role in atmospheric circulation producing vertical transport, redistributing water vapor and trace gases, changing the thermal structure of the Upper Troposphere and Lower Stratosphere (UTLS) and affecting climate through overshooting into the stratosphere. Explosive volcanic eruptions produce large ACs dangerous for the aviation and they can impact climate when the ash is injected into the UTLS.\nThe detection of cloud top height, the determination of cloud extent, the discrimination of ACs from CSs clouds and the detection of overshooting are main challenges for atmospheric natural hazards study. We created a reference atmosphere with a resolution of 5° in latitude and longitude, sampled on a 1° x 1° grid, and a vertical sampling of 100 m. We then compared RO profiles acquired during TCs, CSs and ACs to the reference atmosphere and computed anomaly profiles.CSs, TCs and the ACs leave a clear signature in the atmosphere which can be detected by RO. Using RO temperature and bending angle profiles we gain insight into the vertical thermal structure and developed a new method for detecting the cloud top altitude with high accuracy.\nWe have characterized the TCs by ocean basins and intensities, showing that they have a different thermal structure and reach to different altitudes according to the basin. We provide statistics on overshooting frequency, achieving results consistent with patterns found in the literature and demonstrating that RO is well suited for this kind of study.\nWe have analyzed the Nabro 2010 eruption determining the AC top height and analyzing the long term impact of the eruption in the zonal UTLS thermal structure. The results show that there is a signature allowing the discrimination of ACs from CSs clouds. The comparison of AC top height with the tropopause altitude shows that during Nabro eruption the ash reached the UTLS.",

            "abstract": "In recent decades studying of climate changes on the globe became one of the most important researches. From this point of view, Siberia is particular climatically interest region in Eurasia because of its complicated bioclimatic structure. Climatic changed observed over the region substantially contributes into global climate processes. In particular, temperature trends in the second half of the 20th century were quite high (>0.2 oC/10 yr). The aim of the present work is to estimate intensity of hydrothermal characteristics changes for 1961-2008 over the Baikal Natural Territory on the background of global climate change. Most of the area is characterized by extreme continental climate while the climate of the Baikal coast is close to the seaside. Winter temperature at the shores of Lake Baikal is 5oC higher than at the central areas, but summer air temperature is lower. The annual average temperature is negative almost at the whole area. Annual trends of air temperature are positive and ranged from 0.24 to 0,52 °C per 10 yrs.  Trends for individual months are also positive. They vary from 0.33 (September) to 0.99 °C per 10 years (February). Precipitations over the territory are distributed irregularly. A highest precipitation observes within the Khamar-Daban ridge and on the windward slopes of the ridges bordering the Baikal Lake (up to 1400 mm), at the hinterland highlands (400-700 mm), and in the central part of the Transbaikal steppe (200-250 mm). Minimal amount of precipitation observes in winter, the highest in July and August. Precipitation trends are not statistically significant. The most important extreme hydrothermal phenomena occurring at the study area are droughts. Months and years were revealed when more than 60% of the territory was occupied by the drought. The highest frequency of these events was registered in the period of 1990-2008. Increased droughts intensity observed at coastal stations of the Baikal Lake in May-June, Predbajkale - in July, Transbaikalia - in June and July. Investigation of regional features of hydrothermal characteristics, their long-term fluctuations and extreme events on the background of global climate change allows us to solve the problems associated with economic and environmental objectives.",

            "abstract": "Methane production has been observed in a number of hypersaline environments, and it is generally thought that this methane is produced through the use of non-competitive substrates, such as the methylamines, methanol and dimethylsulfide. The stable carbon isotopic composition of the produced methane has suggested that the methanogens are operating under conditions of substrate limitation. We investigated substrate limitation in gypsum-hosted endoevaporite and soft mat hypersaline environments by the additions of trimethylamine, a non-competitive substrate for methanogenesis, and dried microbial mat, a source of natural organic matter. The δ13C values of the methane produced after amendments were compared to those in unamended control vials. At all hypersaline sites investigated, the δ13C values of the methane produced in the amended vials were statistically lower (by 10 to 71 ‰) than the unamended controls, supporting the hypothesis of substrate limitation at these sites. When substrates were added to the incubation vials, the methanogens within the vials fractionated carbon isotopes to a greater degree, resulting in the production of more 13C-depleted methane. Trimethylamine-amended samples produced lower methane δ13C values than the mat-amended samples. This difference in the δ13C values between the two types of amendments could be due to differences in isotope fractionation associated with the dominant methane production pathway (or substrate used) within the vials, with trimethylamine being the main substrate used in the trimethylamine-amended vials. We hypothesize that increased natural organic matter in the mat-amended vials would increase fermentation rates, leading to higher H2 concentrations and increased CO2/H2 methanogenesis.",

            "abstract": "Environmental science and engineering graduate students often lack training on how to communicate with policy decision makers who are grappling with questions to which research is responding. They communicate directly with mutual experts, but are many times unable to engage with non-experts about their research, thereby limiting the reach and impact of their findings. This presentation highlights opportunities within environmental science and engineering research to create opportunities for researchers to hone skills as knowledge brokers, so they learn ways to meaningfully engage with a range of stakeholders. A knowledge broker is an individual who connects scientific experts and relevant stakeholders with meaningful and useable information. Recognizing that information must flow in multiple directions, the knowledge broker must quickly and effectively translate needs and questions using established relationships. It is these relationships, as well as the synthesis of scientific knowledge into useable information, on which the success of the knowledge broker lies. Using lessons learned, as well as communication science theory related to knowledge brokering, this presentation highlights training opportunities for knowledge brokers who are primarily educated in science and engineering fields, yet seek to engage with societally relevant stakeholders. We present case study examples of knowledge brokering within two large multi-disciplinary research centers. These centers provide unique experiences for researchers to build relationships with stakeholders, so that the scientific experts not only create novel research within their specific discipline, but also inform policy decision makers, community members and regulatory officials.",

            "abstract": "Brazil is a global commodities powerhouse. Over the last decade, dynamic changes in agricultural development and land transformations occurred within Brazil’s tropical savanna region, the cerrado. This interdisciplinary study uses remote sensing tools to map land cover across more than 3.6 million km2 of cerrado and statistical methods to characterize drivers of this land-cover change. We use the MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index 16-day data product and a decision-tree algorithm, proven highly accurate in Mato Grosso (Spera et al. 2014) and here modified for the broader cerrado region, to characterize crop type, cropping frequency, expansion, and abandonment of large-scale mechanized agriculture during the 2001-2013 period. The algorithm exploits phenological differences between forest, pasture and cerrado, and mechanized agriculture. It is parameterized to distinguish between crop rotations in Mato Grosso, Goias, and the new agricultural frontier spanning Maranhao, Tocantins, Piaui, and Bahia (MaToPiBa). Training and validation data were collected using Google’s Earth Engine. We map single-cropped soy, corn, and cotton; double-cropped soy/corn and soy/cotton rotations; and irrigated agriculture across these six Brazilian cerrado states. We find that while double cropping dominates in Mato Grosso and Goias, single cropping is still the dominant form of mechanized agriculture in the burgeoning MaToPiBa region. In western Bahia alone, preliminary results show agriculture has expanded by almost 350,000 ha and double cropping has increased by almost 40,000 ha. With MaToPiBa touted as Brazil’s latest and last agricultural frontier, we predict that the region will experience a transition similar to that of Mato Grosso during the 2000s—an expansion and intensification of agriculture—which may beget unprecedented ramifications on regional climate processes that can then affect ecosystem health and the economic feasibility of cultivating rain-fed export crops.",

            "abstract": "Few examples of in situ fast-spread lower ocean crust exist for sampling. Here we present detailed textural analyses of two sample sets that formed at the East Pacific Rise, collected from tectonic windows at Pito (PD) and Hess (HD) deeps. PD samples (collected by ROV) span the upper ~900 m of lower crust. HD samples (collected by seafloor drilling during IODP Exp. 345) come from >1500 m below the sheeted dike gabbro transition (mbsd).\nPD gabbroic rock textures are consistent with a gabbro glacier flow model generating the uppermost plutonic crust. Shallow samples (41-72 mbsd) likely formed at the distal edge of the magma lens, analogous to similar rocks from Oman. These gabbros are relatively evolved (cpx Mg#75-77, An53-61 and 1-4% Fe-Ti oxides), and have elongate plagioclase grains (aspect ratios up to 1:2:10) exhibiting a strong shape preferred orientation (SPO) with <40% of grains showing dislocation creep textures. Deeper samples (177-876 mbsd) likely began crystallizing in the magma lens then subsided and ‘flowed’ through the underlying mush zone. These gabbros are more primitive below 386 mbsd (Fo83-88, cpx Mg# 85-89 and An70-82), and plagioclase grains have more equilibrated morphologies (aspect ratios < 1:2:6) that define ~vertical SPOs which increase in strength with depth. Plagioclase exhibits magmatic crystal-lattice preferred orientations (CPOs) which are also vertical. Significantly, the proportion of grains showing dislocation creep textures increases with depth, and plagioclase grain size distributions show a smaller range of sizes at depth; observations that perhaps reflect the effect of increasing strain with depth.\nIODP Hole U1415I at HD recovered gabbros and troctolitic gabbros from the mid lower crust that show distinctive cm-dm scale modal layering. Strong plagioclase SPOs parallel layering and magmatic CPOs vary dramatically in strength over just 4.5 m of core. Plagioclase grains are relatively equant (aspect ratios < 1:2:4), wrap around large cpx oikocrysts, and exhibit fewer dislocation creep textures than the PD gabbros. These observations perhaps suggest primary crystal accumulation rather than bulk strain/flow. The similar mineralogy and textures of these samples to those from the Rum layered intrusion suggest HD U1415I gabbros may have formed by mid-crust sill injection.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater simulation has become an essential step on the groundwater resources management and assessment. There are many stand-alone pre and post processing software packages to alleviate the model simulation loading, but the stand-alone software do not consider centralized management of data and simulation results neither do they provide network sharing function. The model buildings are still implemented independently case to case when using these packages. Hence, it is difficult to share and reuse the data and knowledge (simulation cases) systematically within or across companies. Therefore, this study develops a centralized and network based groundwater model developing system to assist model simulation. The system is based on service-oriented architecture and allows remote user to develop their modeling cases on internet. The data and cases (knowledge) are thus easy to manage centralized. MODFLOW is the modeling engine of the system, which is the most popular groundwater model in the world. Other functions include the database management and variety of model developing assisted web services including auto digitalizing of geology profile map、groundwater missing data recovery assisting、graphic data demonstration and auto generation of MODFLOW input files from database that is the most important function of the system. Since the system architecture is service-oriented, it is scalable and flexible. The system can be easily extended to include the scenarios analysis and knowledge management to facilitate the reuse of groundwater modeling knowledge.",

            "abstract": "Slab roll-back and trench retreat are important factors for basin subsidence, magma generation and volcanism in arc-trench systems. From the sedimentary and tectonic record of the Central American island-arc it is evident that repeated slab roll-back and trench retreats occurred since the Late Cretaceous. These trench retreats were most probably related to the subduction of oceanic plateaus and seamounts. Evidence for trench retreats is given by pulses of uplift in the outer-arc area, followed by subsidence in both the fore-arc and back-arc basins. The first slab roll-back probably occurred during the Early Paleocene indicated by the collapse of carbonate platforms, and the re-deposition of large carbonate blocks into deep-water turbidites. At this time the island-arc was transformed from an incipient non-extensional stage into an extensional stage. A new pulse of uplift or decreased subsidence, respectively during the Late Eocene is attributed to subduction of rough crust, a subsequent slab detachment and the establishment of a new subduction zone further westward. Strong uplift especially affected the outer arc of the North Costa Rican arc segment. In the Sandino Fore-arc basin very coarse-grained deep-water channel-levee complexes were deposited. These deposits contain large well-rounded andesitic boulders and are rich in reworked shallow-water carbonates pointing to uplift of the inner fore-arc. Evidence for the subsequent trench retreat is given by an increased subsidence during the early Oligocene in the Sandino Fore-arc Basin and the collapse of the Barra Honda platform in North Costa Rica. Another trench retreat might have occurred in Miocene times. A phase of higher subsidence from 18 to 13 Ma is documented in the geohistory curve of the North Limon Back-arc Basin. After a short pulse of uplift the subsidence increased to approx. 300 m/myr.",

            "abstract": "The Krafla central volcano in NE-Iceland produced about 20 dike intrusions during a rifting episode 1975-1984. These intrusions were always preceded by inflation of the caldera. Once a dike started propagating rapid deflation was observed. The first deflation event began in December 1975 with a dike traveling laterally from the magma chamber. Leveling measurements revealed subsidence of 2 m close to the deflation center. In February 1976 a stage of inflation began and at the same time the seismicity rate in the caldera rose in good correlation with the inflation. A small intrusion started propagating in late September 1976 which was accompanied by maximum subsidence of about 14 cm. However in the next 3 inflation and deflation cycles the inflation periods were almost aseismic until the inflation level of previous cycle was exceeded. At that point a sharp increase in the caldera earthquake count was observed. This phenomenon was observed until late April 1977 when a fissure eruption occurred inside the caldera. By inverting leveling data from 87 stations for a Mogi source and regarding the volume change of the source as a measure of stress we suggest that this phenomenon can be explained by the Kaiser effect. The Kaiser effect is well known from rock mechanics where under cyclic loading and unloading rocks, and other materials, induce dramatic increase in acoustic emissions when the load exceeds that of previous cycles. Krafla demonstrated the same effect while the external stress field was not significantly changed during the aforementioned 3 inflation/deflation cycles. This condition was disturbed when eruption occurred inside the caldera. The state of stress in the vicinity of the magma chamber was changed and subsequent inflation periods were not accompanied by significant seismicity. These results indicate that the Kaiser effect is an important part of understanding the relationship between deformation and seismicity in active volcanoes. The importance of combining seismic and geodetic observations is stressed since a volcano can rapidly inflate without significant changes in seismicity.",

            "abstract": "Recent estimates of 20th century global mean sea-level (GMSL) rise are in the range 1.6-1.9 mm/yr. However, these estimates use a temporally and spatially sparse network of tide gauge observations that may result in a biased estimate due to the incomplete sampling of a global field. Furthermore, this sparse sampling makes resolving the GMSL change into individual sources (e.g., mass loss from individual ice sheets and mountain glaciers, ocean thermal expansion, etc.) challenging. We have employed two different statistical techniques, a multi-model Kalman smoother (KS) and Gaussian process regression (GPR), to address the above challenges. Both techniques naturally accommodate spatio-temporal changes in the availability of tide gauge observations and use models of glacial isostatic adjustment, ocean dynamics, and the sea-level fingerprints of rapid land ice melt to exploit both the spatial and temporal information within observations of the sparsely-sampled global field. We present reconstructions of the global sea-level field estimated with both methods, as well as the associated constraints on the underlying sources of global mean sea-level change. Our results include estimates of the individual contributions of the world’s ice sheets and mountain glaciers to 20th century sea-level change and provide new estimates of the spatial and temporal variability in sea level since 1900.",

            "abstract": "A “hotspot” of accelerated sea level rise has recently been reported along the east coast of the United States, potentially linked with slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation in a warming climate. However, separating acceleration in the long-term trend from transient acceleration due to natural variability - particularly the approximately 60-year cycle associated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation - poses technical difficulties. The Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Ensemble EMD (EEMD) methods have been used to isolate the nonlinear trend from oscillations on various timescales, allowing robust acceleration estimates for the trend. Yet the accuracy of these methods in detecting accelerated sea level rise, particularly given the limited lengths of available tide gauge records, has not yet been fully justified. In this study, idealized sea level time series are constructed based upon interannual, decadal, and multidecadal oscillations obtained from tide gauge observations and prescribed trends with known accelerations. The idealized records are then analyzed with the EMD and EEMD methods and time-varying acceleration error estimates are obtained. Finally, the methods are applied to tide gauge observations from the Atlantic coast encompassing the hotspot region, and the acceleration estimates are interpreted in light of the results from the idealized data. Generally, EEMD provides more stable acceleration estimates that are less sensitive to the record start date than EMD. When the data record exceeds twice the ~67-year multidecadal oscillation period, the EEMD acceleration error falls to ~25% or less for idealized annual mean records with a quadratic trend. For records of intermediate length – between one and two multidecadal oscillation periods – the acceleration error is strongly time-varying. For data records shorter than ~67 years, the multidecadal oscillation is inadequately separated from the nonlinear trend and contributes significantly to the large acceleration detected in the hotspot region during recent decades. However, there is evidence of secular acceleration at Atlantic City, NJ and Philadelphia, PA. These findings have important implications for improved detection of regional sea level acceleration in a warming climate.",

            "abstract": "Mean annual temperatures in the western United States have increased in the last few decades, and during the 21st century, it is predicted that this warming trend will continue. This change in climate may create shifts in the optimal ranges of vegetation within the Rocky Mountains, requiring species migration. For a species at the top of a mountain there may be little room for upward migration. These forests are a crucial part of the US’s carbon budget, thus it is important to analyze how climate change will affect the zonation and species composition of vegetation in Rocky Mountain landscapes. UVAFME is an individual-based gap model that simulates biomass and species composition of a forest. Originally developed for northeast China and applied across all of Russia, this model has accurately simulated diverse forests in a range of climates, as well as the response of these forests to climate change. UVAFME is first calibrated to several sites along the Colorado and Wyoming Rocky Mountains using species, soil, and climate data from the US Forest Service. The initial model output of biomass and species composition is tested against forest inventory data and expected forest type ecotone along an elevational gradient. The model is then run with a linear increase in temperature of 3°C over 200 years, corresponding to the A1B IPPC climate scenario. These results are compared to current forest inventory data and to model runs without climate change. We project that with climate change species ranges will shift up the mountain, leading to an increase in the deciduous species Populus tremuloides, and a decrease in coniferous species at high elevations. These results are an important step in evaluating the response of Rocky Mountain vegetation to climate change and will help predict the future of these crucial ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "It has been observed that the front face of landfalling tsunamis often feature dispersive \"fission\" waves. These are short, almost monochromatic coherent waves which result from the piling up of water as the tsunami rapidly decelerates upon encountering land. Photographs taken during the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami show these waves to resemble cnoidal waves in shape and have a spatial and temporal scale of the same order as swell waves. As part of our goal to study the tsunami in concert with other aspects of the physical environment, we investigate possible physical linkages between the background random swell, monochromatic fission waves, and the long-scale tsunami waves. This particular investigation involves the modification of the dissipation characteristics of random surface waves when interacting with a coherent wavefield (e.g., laboratory proxies for the fission wave or the tsunami). Data from laboratory experiments conducted at the Large Wave Flume at Oregon State University (part of the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation supported by the National Science Foundation) were analyzed and the dissipation characteristics inferred using a steepness-regulated instantaneous dissipation mechanism. It is shown that, for random waves, the instances of significant dissipation events temporally correspond to the appearance of high frequency energy in the time-frequency spectrogram. Furthermore, these observations are strongly affected by the presence of an underlying coherent wave signal, particularly in the case of interaction with a tsunami. We further discuss the possible effect of these interactions on the forces in the hydrodynamic field responsible for sediment transport.",

            "abstract": "Measurements of tree-ring widths are the most widely-distributed and best replicated source of surrogate environmental information on the planet, and are one of the main archives used to estimate changes in regional and global climate during the past several centuries or millennia. Because the Northern Hemisphere ring-width network is now so large, it is more crucial than ever to ensure our understanding of tree-environment relations is not influenced by decisions to include or exclude certain records. It may be the case that a particular set of ring-width records are, for whatever reason, more tightly coupled to a particular climate factor than other records from the same region or species and, as a result, may be superior estimators of that factor’s past behavior. At the same time, it is known that selecting a small number of predictors from a large pool of potential candidates increases the likelihood of a Type I error. That effect may be particularly relevant to dendroclimatology because the total number of available ring-width records is often much larger than the number of records used to produce reconstructions of large-scale climate features. As an initial step, it would be helpful if paleoclimate reconstructions derived from tree rings described more explicitly the criteria used to select ring-width records as potential predictors and specified those records excluded by that screening. By comparing ring-width chronologies and their relations with climate against the standard set by thousands of records across the hemisphere, we should be better able to distinguish climate signals from proxy noise and produce more accurate reconstructions of climate during the late Holocene.",

The gross error check is also discussed in the framework of which statistic, mean, mode of median, is the measure to be “centered” about, given the skewness of lognormal distribution.

This is within the limits of the generally accepted ~2-7 year ENSO cyclicity of the western Pacific. Our results also show a 16-year frequency (95%) suggesting possible additional influence from the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Ring-widths here are most closely correlated to soil moisture conditions through the interaction(s) of abundant winter snowpack, summer rainfall, and average May-August temperatures during the 424-years from 1589-2013. Nearby climate records from the 1948-2013 period show that more favorable growth conditions exist here (higher snowpack+summer precipitation) during the El Niño cycle of ENSO.

            "abstract": "Deep uncertainty refers to situations in which decision makers or stakeholders do not know, or cannot fully agree upon, the full suite of risk factors within a planning problem. This phenomenon is especially important when considering scenarios of future environmental change, since there exist multiple trajectories of environmental forcings (e.g., streamflow timing and magnitude) and socioeconomic factors (e.g., population growth). This presentation first briefly reviews robust optimization and scenario approaches that have been proposed to plan for systems under deep uncertainty. One recently introduced framework is Many Objective Robust Decision Making (MORDM). MORDM combines two techniques: evolutionary algorithm search is used to generate planning alternatives, and robust decision making methods are used to sample performance over a large range of plausible factors and, subsequently, choose a robust solution. Within MORDM, Pareto approximate tradeoff sets of solutions are used to balance objectives and examine alternatives.\nHowever, MORDM does not currently incorporate the deeply uncertain scenario information into the search process itself. In this presentation, we suggest several avenues for doing so, that are focused on modifying the suite of uncertain data that is selected within the search process. Visualizations that compare tradeoff sets across different sets of assumptions can be used to guide decision makers’ learning and, ultimately, their selection of several candidate solutions for further planning. For example, the baseline assumptions about probability distributions can be compared to optimization results under severe events to determine adaptive management strategies. A case study of water planning in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) in Texas is used to demonstrate the approach. Our LRGV results compare baseline optimization with new solution sets that examine optimal management strategies under scenarios characterized by lower than average streamflow and higher evaporation that mimic possible scenarios of water management under climate change. By examining how planning strategies change under the new optimization runs, we show the impact of deep uncertainty assumptions on the best strategies for mitigating environmental change in the LRGV problem.",

            "abstract": "An isolated substorm onset event that occurred on 14 February 2001 was recorded by the WIC on IMAGE. WIC observed an enhanced electron precipitation region that grew out of a pseudo-breakup auroral spot at the poleward boundary that moved southward and activitated an aurora. An isolated substorm onset was triggered when the pseudo-breakup region connected to the activitated aurora at the lower boundary. This observation is a global scale phenomenon, whose behavior is similar but also different from observations of north-south motion at smaller localized scales that precede the onset of substorms (Nishimura et al., 2010). Fortuitously, Cluster during this pseudo-break auroral activity, detected escape of low energy (20-50 eV) field-aligned O+ ions. The triggered onset was accompanied by the escape of more energetic O+ (80 eV -300 eV) ions. Our observations suggest that the escaping O+ ions during pseudo-breakup auroras may be the seed for the onset of isolated substorms needed in some simulation models (Winglee and Harnett, 2010).",

            "abstract": "Earth's Critical Zone (CZ) is the thin outer veneer of our planet from the top of the tree canopy to the bottom of our drinking water aquifers that supports almost all human activity. Despite its fundamental importance to terrestrial life, understanding of the operation of the coupled geologic, hydrologic, topographic, and biotic CZ processes across time and space is far from complete. These interactions are complex and they establish a mechanistic ‘chain of impact’ that transmits the effects of environmental change throughout the CZ. Characterization of these processes is made more urgent by the fact that globally, the CZ is experiencing ever-increasing pressure from growth in human population and wealth. Within the next four decades, demand for food and fuel is expected to double along with a more than 50% increase in demand for clean water. Understanding, predicting and managing intensification of land use and associated economic services, while mitigating and adapting to rapid climate change, is now one of the most pressing societal challenges of the 21st century. In this talk we summarize the profound global societal impacts to the Earth’s near surface arising from exponential human population growth, increasing affluence, and technological advance, to provide context for discussions on constructing an array of CZ observatories to both characterize fundamental critical zone processes and forecast the effects of planetary change. We will suggest goals and options relevant to planning for a future international array of CZ observatories and a research agenda that matches the urgency of the projected resource demands and environmental pressures of the coming four decades.",

            "abstract": "Mid-latitude mesoscale convective systems (MCS) are large convective engines that redistribute heat and moisture throughout the atmosphere. Upper level divergence and detrainment above the level of maximum vertical motion and below the vicinity of the tropopause leads to the formation of horizontally and vertically expansive anvil clouds. These are composed largely of weakly precipitating ice species and potentially supercooled liquid water that may homogeneously freeze at higher anvil altitudes. Because of the tremendous horizontal expanse of anvil cloud decks they can impact the radiation budget by reflecting incoming shortwave and outgoing longwave radiation, and potential changes to anvil extent or characteristics are thus important factors in climate change scenarios.\nIncreasing the number concentration of cloud droplet nucleating aerosols within various cloud systems has been shown to alter cloud droplet size distributions which leads to changes in warm rain formation, vertical distributions of cloud water, latent heating profiles, riming rates, and precipitation rates. If additional cloud water is generated and lofted higher within MCSs under scenarios of high aerosol concentration, then there is the potential for modification of anvil cloud microphysical and radiative properties and anvil dynamics. Results will be presented from cloud resolving numerical simulations of an MCS that occurred May 23 during the MC3E field project based in Oklahoma in 2011. Aerosol effects on MCS anvil characteristics will be contrasted within the range of observed clean and polluted aerosol conditions. The focus will be to address the range of response in anvil ice distributions, ice microphysical processes, anvil areal coverage, and local changes in short and longwave radiation to variations in aerosol number concentration.",

Variations in topography, width and occurrence of the discontinuities indicate lateral variations in temperature, composition and water content, as these variations influence the mantle phase transitions. Seismic studies of the conversions of pressure to shear waves (Pds phases) are an important tool to observe lateral variations in these discontinuities.\nHere we collect a Pds data set across all European seismic stations since 2000 that are available through ORFEUS or IRIS; resulting in ~500,000 event-station pairs. We deconvolve the radial component by the vertical component – assumed to represent the source component- using the iterative deconvolution method to obtain receiver functions. We assess the quality of a receiver function by the signal-to-noise ratio and by evaluating how well the radial component is reproduced when reconvolving the receiver function with the vertical component. This results in ~36,000 high quality receiver functions across Europe.\nOur receiver functions show little lateral variation in the depth of the transition zone discontinuities across the East European Craton, and we use this region as a reference to the more tectonically unstable regions. Around the Mediterranean, we look for signature of slabs ponding or penetrating at the discontinuity around 660 km. The Hellenic slab, which in tomographic models extends into the lower mantle, causes a signature of a disappearing '410' and a deeper, broader '660'. There are also potential signatures of '300' and '520' discontinuities in the slab region.\nTo explain our observations we compute synthetic Ps receiver functions for mantle transition zone models of various temperatures for various compositional models. The synthetic seismic velocity models are computed using Perple_X (Connolly, 2005) with the mineral parameter database of Stixrude and Lithgow-Bertolloni (2011). The synthetics are computed with the reflectivity method. The data and synthetics need to be compared to use the observations as a thermometer or indicator of slab composition or water content.",

            "abstract": "Large, glacially-dammed lakes formed via the impoundment of the Tsangpo River in Tibet led to lake-burst floods during the late Pleistocene and at least two intervals in the early and late Holocene. We present the first critical examination of the potential effects that the Holocene lake drainages had on the downstream Bengal delta and their preservation in the geologic record. Based on stratigraphic evidence from cores drilled across the delta, digital elevation models, seismic data, and hydraulic flow calculations, we propose that lake-burst floods could be responsible for (a) triggering short-lived avulsion events of the Brahmaputra River into the Sylhet basin, (b) the formation of two apparent overflow channels on the Madhupur Terrace, and (c) the deposition of a large, mass transport deposit in the submarine Swatch of No Ground canyon system. Comparing the early and late Holocene events, we expect the distribution of the floodwaters and their deposits in the two intervals to differ sharply owing to major differences in flood volume and the paleotopography of the delta. Despite much higher discharge, the early Holocene floods were largely accommodated within the vast lowstand valley of the Brahmaputra, with some spillover into the Sylhet basin. In contrast, the late Holocene floods likely spread over a larger area due to the relatively even, low-gradient topography. Offshore, a 40 m thick chaotic, semi-transparent seismic facies observed in the canyon corresponds temporally with the early Holocene floods and is tentatively interpreted as a subaqueous debris flow generated by the flood pulse directed to the canyon via the lowstand river valley. We examine the theoretical preservation potential of rare flood events in light of signal shredding mechanisms to help explain why evidence of the larger, early Holocene floods is preserved whereas we have found no clear signal from the younger floods.",

            "abstract": "Despite numerous experimental and numerical studies investigating transport over ripples and dunes in rivers, the spatiotemporal details of the pattern of transport over bedforms remain largely unknown. Here we report turbulence-resolving, simultaneous measurements of bedload motion and near-bed fluid velocity downstream of a backward facing step in a laboratory flume. Details are compared to a coupled large eddy simulation and distinct element simulation (LES-DEM) of the same geometry.\nTwo synchronized high-speed video cameras simultaneously observed bed load motion and the motion of neutrally buoyant particles in a laser light sheet 6 mm above the bed at 250 frames/s downstream of a 3.8 cm backward-facing step. Particle imaging velocimetry algorithms were applied to the laser sheet images to obtain two-dimensional field of two-dimensional vectors while manual particle tracking techniques were applied to the video images of the bed. As expected, there is a strong positive correlation between sediment flux and near-bed fluid velocity. Sediment flux was determined by manually tracking grains that passed over a 6 cm long line in the middle of the field of view on the bedload images. Sediment flux increased monotonically downstream of flow reattachment. Localized, intermittent, high-magnitude transport events were more apparent near flow reattachment than further downstream. Often, these high-magnitude events were seen to have significant cross-stream particle velocities. These events are consistent with permeable “splat events” visualized in the LES-DEM numerical simulations, wherein a volume of fluid moves toward and impinges on the bed. Fluid impingement and penetration of the bed results in outward flow and sediment motion from the center of the splat. Work is ongoing to quantify spatial and temporal autocorrelations and covariances of the fluid velocity and sediment motions.",

These included deployments during July 2011 over Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, MD, during January and February 2013 over the San Joaquin Valley of California, during September 2013 over Houston, TX and during July and August 2014 over Denver, CO.

These measurements constitute a diverse data set for use in characterizing the spatial and temporal distribution of aerosols, aerosol optical thickness (AOT), as well as the mixed layer (ML) height. Analysis of the ML height at these four locations is presented, including temporal and horizontal variability and comparisons between land and water, including the Chesapeake Bay and Galveston Bay. Using the ML heights, the distribution of AOT relative to the ML heights is determined, which is relevant for assessing the long-range transport of aerosols. The ML heights are also used to help relate column AOT measurements and extinction profiles to surface PM2.5 concentrations. The HSRL ML heights are also used to evaluate the performance in simulating the temporal and spatial variability of ML heights from both chemical regional models and global forecast models.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol particles affect the radiative energy balance in the atmosphere and thus influence regional and global climate through the direct and indirect radiative effect. Aerosols may result in net cooling or warming of the air, changes of the large-scale atmospheric circulation, cloud lifetime, and occurrence and intensity of precipitation. The presence and distribution of aerosols in space and time is highly inhomogeneous and variable. In addition, aerosol radiative forcing depends on the vertical distribution of aerosols. Regular observations of aerosol optical and physical properties over large temporal and spatial scales are needed for radiative impact studies to address the gaps in knowledge of the role of aerosols in climate change. In this context, light detection and ranging (lidar) instruments will play a crucial role as only these instruments provide information of aerosol properties with high vertical resolution.\nHere we present a novel, automated and unsupervised algorithm called the Arrange & Average algorithm that employs a look-up table for the purpose of retrieving the real and imaginary part of the complex refractive index (CRI), effective radius, and total number, surface-area, and volume concentrations of particle size distributions for a wide range of parameter space. The distinctive feature of our approach is that the CRI is treated like other retrieval parameters which significantly simplifies the whole numerical scheme. The algorithm is used for processing optical data acquired with different measurement configurations of multiwavelength high-spectral-resolution lidar or Raman lidar.\nThe Arrange & Average algorithm is simple in its practical realization and flexible in the sense that it can be easily applied to various configurations of lidar instruments. We have conducted detailed numerical simulations and performance tests of the algorithm for 4 important lidar instrument configurations: “3 backscatter (β) + 2 extinction (α)” (“3β + 2α”), “3β + 1α”, “2β + 1α”, and “3β”. All the simulations were done under the assumption of particle size- and wavelength independent CRIs. The performance of the algorithm with regard to the retrieval precision of the investigated aerosol properties slowly degrades if we remove the input optical data.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen oxides (NOx ≡ NO + NO2) in the free troposphere largely control the production of ozone (O3), an important greenhouse gas and atmospheric oxidant. As HNO3 is the dominant sink of tropospheric NOx, improved understanding of its production and loss mechanisms can help to better constrain NOx emissions, and in turn improve understanding of ozone production and its effect on climate. However, this understanding is inhibited by the scarcity of direct measurements of free tropospheric HNO3, particularly in the tropics. We interpret tropical tropospheric nitric acid columns from the IASI satellite instrument with a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). Overall GEOS-Chem generally agrees with IASI, however we find that the simulation underestimates IASI nitric acid over Southeast Asia by a factor of two. The bias is confirmed by comparing the GEOS-Chem simulation with additional satellite (HIRDLS, ACE-FTS) and aircraft (PEM-Tropics A and PEM-West B) observations of the middle and upper troposphere. We show that this bias can be explained by the parameterization of lightning NOx emissions, primarily from the misrepresentation of concentrated subgrid lightning NOx plumes. We tested a subgrid lightning plume parameterization and found that an additional 0.5 Tg N with an ozone production efficiency of 15 mol/mol would reduce the regional nitric acid bias from 92% to 6% without perturbing the rest of the tropics. Other sensitivity studies such as modified NOx yield per flash, increased altitude of lightning NOx emissions, or changes to convective mass flux or wet deposition of nitric acid required unrealistic changes to reduce the bias. This work demonstrates the importance of a comprehensive lightning parameterization to constraining NOx emissions.",

            "abstract": "A fundamental problem confronting hazard modelers in slowly deforming regions such as the central and eastern United States, Australia, and inner Honshu, is whether the current seismicity represents the steady state earthquake potential, or is instead a decaying potential associated with past mainshocks. If the current seismicity were composed of long-lived aftershock sequences, it might then be anti-correlated with the next large earthquakes. While aftershock productivity is known to be a property of the mainshock magnitude, aftershock duration (the time until the aftershock rate decays to the pre-mainshock rate) should, according to rate/state friction theory of Dieterich[1994], be inversely proportional to the fault stressing rate. If so, slowly deforming regions would be expected to sustain long aftershock sequences. Most tests have supported the Dieterich hypothesis, but use ambiguous proxies for the fault stressing rate, such as the mainshock recurrence interval. Here we test the hypothesis by examining off-fault aftershocks of the 2011 M=9 Tohoku-oki rupture up to 250 km from the source, as well as near-fault aftershocks of six large Japanese mainshocks, sampling a range of receiver faults, from thrusts slipping 80 mm/yr, to normal faults slipping 0.1 mm/yr. We find that aftershock sequences lasted a month on the fastest-slipping faults, have durations of 10-100 years on faults slipping 1-10 mm/yr, and are projected to persist for at least 200 years on the slowest faults. Although the Omori decay exponent for short and long sequences is similar, the very different background rates account for the duration differences. If the stressing rate is generally proportional to fault slip rate, then aftershock durations indeed support the Dieterich hypothesis. The test means that the hazard associated with aftershocks depends on local tectonic conditions rather than on the mainshock magnitude alone. Because declustering approaches do not remove such long-lived aftershocks, these shocks can be misinterpreted as independent events. Aftershock sequences may thus masquerade as background seismicity and misguide hazard assessments in slowly deforming regions. Depending on how the hazard is calculated, this can lead to over- or underestimates of hazard in aftershock zones.",

Although injection of oxidants has been used for chemical transformation of organic contaminants, NOD represents a challenge for the in-situ delivery of oxidants as a remediation alternative. Co-injection of complexation agents with oxidants has been proposed to facilitate the delivery of oxidants for in situ chemical oxidation remediation of contaminated groundwater. This study investigates variability of NOD for different oxidants and sediments. The effect of the addition of various complexation agents, including EDTA, tween 80, hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPCD), humic acid, and four generations of poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers, on the NOD was also examined. NOD was measured for a clay loam (collected from Air Force Plant 44 in Tucson, AZ). Varying amounts of biosolids were mixed with subsamples of the clay loam to create three additional reference soils in order to study the effect of organic matter and other soil characteristics on the NOD. Bench-scale laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the NOD for various oxidants, using the four soils, and replicated with and without various delivery agents. Measured NOD showed variability for each soil and oxidant composition. Additionally, significant differences were observed in NOD with the addition of delivery agents. The results support the elucidation of potential controls over NOD and have implications for in situ, oxidation-based remediation of contaminated groundwater.",

            "abstract": "Models of bedrock channel cross-section evolution typically rely on simple approximations of boundary shear stress to calculate erosion rates across the channel. While such models provide a useful tool for gaining general insight into channel dynamics, they also exhibit a narrower range of behaviors than seen in nature and scale experiments. Recent computational advances enable use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to relax many of the assumptions used in these simple models by simulating the full 3D flow field and resulting erosion. We have developed a model of bedrock channel evolution at the reach scale, using CFD, that alternates flow simulation steps with channel evolution steps and evolves the channel in time according to shear stresses calculated from the CFD runs.\nCaves provide an ideal field setting for studying bedrock channel dynamics, because long records of incision are often preserved in the form of channel widths, meander patterns, and sculpted forms, such as scallops, that indicate flow velocity and direction. However, most existing numerical models of cave formation investigate processes on larger scales, treat conduits as simple shapes, such as cylinders, and deal with the early stages of speleogenesis when sediment transport and erosion mechanisms other than dissolution do not have to be taken into account. Therefore, initial applications of the CFD model focus on the dynamics of cave channels, and particularly on the controls of channel width. While discharge, base level, sediment supply, and the ratio of dissolution to mechanical erosion, are likely to play important roles in determining channel width, we lack a quantitative understanding for the importance of these various factors. Notches in passage walls are thought to result from lateral erosion during periods of increased sediment load when the bed is armored. Modeling is used to check the plausibility of this explanation, and examine whether other mechanisms may also produce notches. Paragenesis is a mode of cave passage formation under full pipe conditions where the floor is armored by sediment and incision proceeds upwards. However, the dynamics of this process are not understood and are also explored using the CFD model.",

            "abstract": "Numerical simulations of alternative scenarios that could have transpired\nduring the Oso, Washington, landslide of 22 March 2014 provide insight\ninto factors responsible for the landslide's devastating high-speed runout.\nWe performed these simulations using D-Claw, a numerical model we\nrecently developed to simulate landslide and debris-flow motion from\ninitiation to deposition. D-Claw solves a hyperbolic system of fi ve partial\ndiff erential equations that describe simultaneous evolution of the thickness,\nsolid volume fraction, basal pore-fluid pressure, and two components of\nmomentum of the moving mass. D-Claw embodies the concept of\nstate-dependent dilatancy, which causes the solid volume fraction m to\nevolve toward a value that is equilibrated to the ambient stress state and\nshear rate. As the value of m evolves, basal pore-fluid pressure coevolves,\nand thereby causes an evolution in frictional resistance to motion. Our Oso\nsimulations considered alternative scenarios in which values of all model\nparameters except the initial solid volume fraction m0 were held constant.\nThese values were: basal friction angle = 36\u000e; static critical-state solid\nvolume fraction = 0.64; initial sediment permeability = 10-8 m2; pore-fluid\ndensity = 1100 kg/m3; sediment grain density = 2700 kg/m3; pore-fluid\nviscosity = 0.005 Pa-s; and dimensionless sediment compressibility\ncoe\u000efficient = 0.03. Simulations performed using these values and m0 = 0.62\nproduced widespread landslide liquefaction, runaway acceleration, and\nlandslide runout distances, patterns and speeds similar to those observed or\ninferred for the devastating Oso event. Alternative simulations that used\nm0 = 0.64 produced a much slower landslide that did not liquefy and that\ntraveled only about 100 m before stopping. This relatively benign behavior\nis similar to that of several landslides at the Oso site prior to 2014. Our\nfindings illustrate a behavioral bifurcation that is highly sensitive to the\ninitial solid volume fraction. They suggest that the destructiveness of the\n2014 Oso event may have resulted in part from prior slope deformation that\nproduced a dilated sediment state that made the sediment susceptible to\ncontraction and liquefaction as it began to fail on March 22.",

            "abstract": "Over a century of paleoclimate research in western North America (NA) has documented a dynamic hydroclimatic history. Proxy records reveal significant changes during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), when expanded pluvial lakes point to greater water availability in the southwest, while shrinking glaciers and arid-adapted vegetation indicate drier conditions approaching the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Climate modeling studies have attributed these changes to splitting and strengthening of the westerly jet, deepening of the Aleutian low pressure in the winter and weakening of the North Pacific high during the summer. Models and proxies provide complementary means for understanding climate change. As such, this study contributes a systematic comparison of the diverse western NA proxy data with the patterns of LGM hydroclimatic variability predicted by models.\nTo identify key drivers of hydroclimatic change in this water sensitive region, we analyzed the statistical agreement between a network of over seventy precipitation-sensitive proxy reconstructions from western NA and an ensemble of fifteen model simulations conducted as part of the Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project (PMIP). Using the LGM and preindustrial simulations from PMIP2 and PMIP3, we analyzed the sign, spatial distribution, and seasonality of precipitation, as well as the pressure systems and associated wind patterns predicted by the models. During the LGM, the proxy records indicate a precipitation dipole, with a wetter southwest and drier northeast divided by a northwest-southeast trending transition zone across the northern Great Basin. The improved implementation of ice sheet topography and higher resolution models used in PMIP3 result in better proxy-model agreement. Models predict no substantial change in the seasonality of precipitation. Those models that simulate a weaker and weakly south-shifted Aleutian low, a strong North Pacific high, and a high above the Laurentide Ice Sheet best capture the pattern of variation observed in the proxy network. These models simulate a stronger LGM jet that is not shifted southward but is squeezed and steered by high-pressure systems, underscoring the importance of these systems in structuring hydroclimatic variability in western NA.",

            "abstract": "The Milankovitch theory of orbital forcing fails to explain the 100-kyr pacing of the recent glacial cycles since the eccentricity cycle produces negligible changes in seasonal or mean annual insolation on this timescale. The 100-kyr periodicity has been proposed to arise from eccentricity pacing, obliquity pacing, or internal climate variability. A purely statistical test1, based on cross-wavelet analysis between an untuned benthic isotope record (the LR04 stack) and insolation for the past 1.2 Myr, supports eccentricity pacing.\nHere, we present a new version of this statistical test, which takes into consideration updated uncertainty estimates for the untuned LR04 age model. The new untuned age model is independent of orbital forcing but assumes a constant sediment rate between age control points, after adjustment for compaction. The age control points are provided by the radiometrically-dated magnetic reversals of the Quaternary geomagnetic instability time scale2. Our approach to uncertainty quantification entails Monte-Carlo ensembles of possible realizations of the untuned age model, which takes into account the uncertainty in the age control tie points and the uncertainty in the compaction correction. We then apply cross-wavelet analysis on each Monte-Carlo record to investigate (1) the relative phase of eccentricity and glacial cycle and (2) the relative, time-dependent 100,000-year power of eccentricity and climate response over the past 1.2 Myr.\n1 Lisiecki, L.

            "abstract": "It has been found that evaporation over bare soil plays an important role in subsurface solute transport processes. A numerical study, based on a density-dependent variably saturated groundwater flow model MARUN, was conducted to investigate subsurface flow and salt transport in bare saline aquifers subjected to transient evaporation. The bulk aerodynamic formulation was adopted to simulate transient evaporation rate at ground surface. Subsurface flow pattern, moisture distribution, and salt migration were quantified. Key factors likely affecting this process, including saturated hydraulic conductivity, capillary drive, air humidity, and surrounding water supply, were examined. The results showed that evaporation induced an upward flow pattern, which led to a high saline plume formed beneath the evaporation zone. In absence of surrounding water supply, as the humidity between the ground surface and air tended to equilibrium, evaporation-induced density gradient generated pore water circulations around the plume edge and caused the salt to migrate downwards with “finger” shapes. It was found that capillary properties and atmospheric condition had significant impacts on subsurface moisture distribution and salt migration in response to the evaporation. Larger capillary fringe and/or lower air humidity would allow evaporation to extract more water from the ground. It would induce a larger and denser saline plume formed beneath the evaporation zone. The results also suggested that the presence of the surrounding water supply (represented as a constant water table herein) could provide a steady evaporation rate at the ground surface; meanwhile, in response to the evaporation, a hydraulic gradient was formed from the water supply boundary, which induced an inclined upper saline plume with greater density far from the supply boundary.",

            "abstract": "The Mongolian Plateau is a broad regional uplift positioned between the Siberian Craton to the north and the far northern edge of the India-Asia collision to the south. Within this intracontinental setting of high topography, the Hangay Dome in central Mongolia reaches elevations of 4 km and contains intermittent basaltic magmatism over the last 30 Ma. The relationship between high topography, magmatism, and geodynamic processes remains largely unsolved although processes ranging from lithospheric delamination to mantle plume effects have been proposed. A temporary array of seismic stations was deployed around the Hangay Dome to determine lithospheric structure. Preliminary results are shown from receiver function analysis, ambient noise tomography, and teleseismic P-wave tomography. Crustal thickness measurements from H-k stacking of receiver functions range from 42 km to 57 km across the array, with thicker crust beneath the highest topography. The bulk crustal Vp/Vs ratio ranges from 1.71 to 1.9 with a median value for the array of 1.77, perhaps indicating a variable crustal composition with some regions having a more mafic crust. The stacked receiver functions are also combined with ambient noise phase velocity dispersion measurements in a joint inversion for shear velocity profiles at each station which reveals crustal thickness estimates consistent with the H-k stacks while also determining the shear velocity step at the Moho. Teleseismic P-wave travel time residuals ranging between +/-1 second are inverted for a 3D P-wave velocity model using finite-frequency kernels. Notable features include 1) a low velocity anomaly (-3%) in the upper 200 km beneath the eastern part of the Hangay Dome near the Orkhon River Valley, , 2) a steeply dipping low velocity anomaly to the north of the Hangay Dome, perhaps related to the nearby Baikal Rift, and 3) generally higher velocities in the upper 200 km surrounding the high topography. To first order, the high topography of the Hangay Dome appears to be largely supported by thickened crust. However, lower P-wave velocities in the upper mantle beneath the dome are observed. The relative contributions of crustal thickness and upper mantle structure for support of topography and their relationship to magmatism will be determined with further refinement of the models.",

            "abstract": "Regional balance of the atmospheric energy budget provides a stringent constraint to evaluate datasets of global energy budgets. Previous studies indicated that satellite-based and reanalysis estimates describe different heating rates in the atmosphere. Compared to the satellite-based heating rates, reanalyses (European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecast Interim, ERA-Interim, and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, MERRA) have larger heating in the tropical convective regimes and smaller cooling in the subtropical subsidence regimes. Many of these discrepancies originate in cloudy regions where different estimation methods give different energy budgets. In this study, we investigate how different components of the surface energy budget depend on cloud properties in the atmosphere. We will also examine the dependence of discrepancies between reanalysis and the satellite-based surface energy budgets on cloud properties. Different satellite-based estimates, including Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)-based surface shortwave and longwave heat fluxes, NASA Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment surface energy budget (SRB) shortwave and longwave radiative heat fluxes, Goddard Satellite-based Surface Turbulent Flux (GSSTF)’s sensible and latent heat fluxes, and the objectively-analyzed air-sea fluxes (OAFlux), are collocated with cloud property measurements of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). MODIS cloud optical depth (COD) and cloud top pressure (CTP) are used to identify cloud types. Different components of surface energy budgets from the satellite-based estimates and the discrepancies from their reanalysis counterparts will be presented as functions of COD and CTP for selected regions that represent tropical convective and subtropical subsidence regimes.",

            "abstract": "Detection and attribution of human influence on sea level rise are important topics that have not yet been explored in depth. From the perspective of assessing the contribution of human activities to climate changes, the sea level drivers can be partitioned in anthropogenic and natural forcing. In this study we try to answer the following two questions: (1) How large a sea level trend could be expected as result of natural internal variability? (2) Whether the sea level changes observed over the past century were natural in origin. We suppose that natural behavior of sea level consists of increases and decreases occurring with frequencies following a power law distribution and the monthly sea level records are power law long-term correlated time series. Then we search for the presence of unnatural external sea level trend by applying statistics of Lennartz and Bunde [2009]. We estimate the minimum anthropogenic sea level trend as a lower bound of statistically significant external sea level trend in the longest tide-gauge records worldwide. We apply this new method to distinguish between the trend-like natural oscillations and the external trends in the longest available sea level records and in global mean sea level reconstructions. The results show that the long-term persistence impacts strongly on sea level rise estimation. We provide statistical evidences that the observed sea level changes, at global and regional scales, are beyond its natural internal variability and cannot be explained without human influence. We found that sea level change during the past century contains an external component at 99% significance level in two thirds of the available longest tidal records worldwide. The anthropogenic sea level trend is about 1 mm/yr in global sea level reconstructions that is more than half of the total observed sea level trend during the XXth century, which is about 1.7 mm/yr. This work provides the first estimate of the minimal anthropogenic contribution to the observed sea level rise, which is crucial for developing climate adaptation strategies and for understanding human influence on the Earth climate.",

            "abstract": "Solar-powered automated flux station was deployed continuously inside the Bluff Road Landfill (Lincoln, NE) for the period of over4 years starting June 2010. Landfill methane emissions were measured using the eddy covariance method, reporting hourly emission rates. The data shown in this presentation are from the period of June to December 2010 when no gas recovery was in operation. The continuous measurements of hourly emission rates allowed a number of important analyses of the key factors affecting landfill methane emissions at different time scales.\nIn particular, the results show that landfill methane emissions strongly depended on changes in barometric pressure. Rising barometric pressure suppressed the emission, while falling barometric pressure enhanced the emission, resulting in up to a 35-fold variation in day-to-day methane emissions. Wavelet coherence analysis revealed a strong spectral coherency between variations of barometric pressure and methane emission at periodicities ranging from 1 day to 8 days. Power spectrum and ogive analysis showed that at least 10 days of continuous measurements was needed in order to capture 90% of the total variance in the methane emission time series at the site.\nFrom these results, it is apparent that point-in-time measurements taken at monthly or longer time intervals using techniques such as the trace plume method, the mass balance method, or the closed-chamber method will be subject to large variations in measured emission rates because of the barometric pumping phenomenon. Estimates of long-term integrated methane emissions based on such measurements could yield uncertainties, ranging from 28% underestimation to 32% overestimation.\nThe results demonstrate a need for continuous measurements to quantify annual total landfill emissions. This conclusion may also apply to the wetlands, peatlands, lakes, and other environments where emissions are from porous media or ebullition. ",

            "abstract": "Mineral dust sources are typically located in very bright, arid desert regions across the globe. In the past, aerosol retrieval algorithms were unable to properly handle these bright surfaces which lead to large, persistent data gaps. In order to eliminate these gaps, the Deep Blue algorithm was developed and first entered into the MODIS operational stream in Collection 5.1. Since then, the Deep Blue algorithm has evolved to retrieve not only over bright surfaces, but also vegetated surfaces. This updated algorithm has been named the enhanced Deep Blue (e-Deep Blue) algorithm and has been successfully applied to reflectances from the Sea-viewing, Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS, 1997-2010), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, 2000/2002-present), and now the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS, 2012-present) aboard the Suomi-NPP platform. This algorithm has been partnered with a new over-ocean algorithm for our SeaWiFS and VIIRS datasets.\nDue to the broad swath of VIIRS, daily global coverage is achieved at higher spatial resolution compared to MODIS and SeaWiFS. Thus, the evolution of dust can be tracked from source to sink, across both land and ocean using these satellite products. We introduce the basics of the e-Deep Blue algorithm along with our preliminary VIIRS e-Deep Blue products, including aerosol optical thickness at 550nm and Ǻngström exponent. Validation with AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) data are also presented along with the intercomparisons between VIIRS Deep Blue and other satellite products.",

It is also noted an increase of extreme events, mainly excess of rainfall causing damages to many parts of the Sahel area. In this study, we are focusing on an extreme case, which occurred during September 2009. A deep African Easterly Wave (AEW) crossed the region from Niger to Senegal giving heavy rains along its path with a maximum of more than 260mm in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. While continuing its trajectory other strong winds associated with the systems caused other kind of damages. A modeling strategy, based on a moving nest with the Weather Research and Forecast model (WRF-ARW), is used to simulate the system.  The model is run at 27 and 9km respectively for the outer and inner domains. Key parameters are investigated in order to assess the ability of WRF model in simulating the even. The study has shown good performance of WRF in simulating tropical systems. Noted weaknesses are also highlighted in the study, which showed promising results in simulating extremes, hours to days head, in support to early warning systems (EWS) to mitigate the adverse effects of extremes.  This is a key responsibility of National Meteorological Services lacking this capacity in developing countries of West Africa.",

            "abstract": "The buildup and dissipation of plasma in the inner magnetosphere is a complex process that is governed by many factors. One important factor is the rate of pitch-angle diffusion of trapped electrons into the precipitation loss cone. This loss rate is not only important for understanding the dynamics of energetic electrons. Rather, because of the coupled dynamics of the inner magnetosphere system, the loss of energetic electrons feeds back on the electric fields (via auroral ionospheric conductance enhancements), which in turn modify the drift paths of all ions and electrons. But describing the loss of electrons is a challenging problem. One important population of inner magnetosphere plasma that is highly relevant for calculating electron losses, and one which our model—the Rice Convection Model-Equilibrium (RCM-E)—has neglected, is the cold plasma population of the plasmasphere. Because the plasmasphere contains the bulk of the mass of plasma in the inner magnetosphere, it plays a dominant role in determining the plasma wave environment that drives diffusion and losses of electrons. At the very least, the location of the outer boundary of the plasmasphere (the plasmapause), at which the plasmaspheric density drops sharply, needs to be modeled in order to determine the regions where various wave modes operate (whistler-mode chorus, plasmaspheric hiss, and electromagnetic ion-cyclotron waves). In this study we present results of the RCM-E that include a cold plasma population whose source is ionospheric outflow, and whose shape is determined by ExB drift in the self-consistent fields of the RCM-E. We also present comparisons with Van Allen Probes data showing how our modeled plasmapause location compares with observational data during the 1-June-2013 magnetic storm, and how it affects the electron losses and, in turn, the ion and electron transport.",

Models initiate convection too early in the afternoon and dry out too early in the evening compared to observations. The models generally underestimate the diurnal amplitude of convective cloudiness and are shown to have the largest diurnal cycle errors on days with observed convection. Misrepresenting the diurnal cycle of convection can result in climatological model errors upwards of 20% and much higher errors at short time-scales. The 11-year record of 3-hourly data used in this analysis includes: TOA/surface fluxes, precipitable water and cloud fraction from CERES Ed3a, precipitation flux from TRMM 3B42 and atmospheric state data from MERRA and ERA-Interim. This study identifies under which atmospheric conditions the model errors are largest, provides critical insight on reducing these errors over the Amazon and helps gain a better understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for the triggering of convection in the Amazon in both the observations and models.",

In this presentation, we discuss near-term projections (2050) of air quality impacts on both crop productivity and nitrogen deposition.\nFirst, we contrast the relative impacts of ozone air pollution and a warming climate on global crop yields. To do so, we define statistical crop yield functions to a warming climate based on the historical record. We combine these relationships with ozone-damage estimates and apply these to future air quality and climate projections from a global coupled chemistry-climate model (CESM). We find substantial variability in the response, with certain regions or crops more sensitive to ozone pollution and others more sensitive to warming. This work demonstrates that air quality management is a key element to ensuring global food security.\nSecond, we examine the relative impacts of anthropogenic emissions, climate change, and land use change on global nitrogen deposition. Nitrogen deposition has rapidly increased over the Anthropocene. Excess deposition of nitrogen to ecosystems can lead to eutrophication of waters, and a decrease in biodiversity. We use the CESM to investigate two scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP8.5) and focus our analysis on the impacts on diverse ecoregions in North America, Europe, and Asia.",

            "abstract": "Geogenic groundwater arsenic poses a considerable health threat to a large, largely agrarian population in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. Demand for groundwater continues to rise despite limited information about where arsenic contamination occurs and how it may be affected by excessive pumping. We investigate arsenic measurements from over >40,000 wells found throughout the Delta’s seven major exploited aquifers, relating trends in contamination to ancillary physico-chemical datasets. Logistic regression modeling shows that among wells in the most shallow aquifers, arsenic occurrence above the WHO standard (10 µg/L) is best described by a well’s distance to 1) the Mekong River network and 2) delta front, its depth and location within fault-bounded areas of the delta. The shallow model is inadequate to capture contaminant occurrence in deeper aquifers (generally 200-500m) where wells are rarely contaminated except in near-river areas undergoing heavy pumping. Our results are the first to quantify how the probability of arsenic contamination varies in 3D throughout the complex aquifer system in relation to both natural and anthropogenically-mediated factors, and suggest that excessive extraction may be degrading the quality of deep aquifers. Findings may serve as a baseline for managing groundwater use for optimal human welfare and assessing any future changes in arsenic occurrence.",

We consider the cases when Europa is located in, above and below the magnetospheric current sheet.\nRecently, Roth et al. (2014) discovered transient water vapor plumes near Europa's south pole. Here we provide a structured study of the influence of plumes in Europa's atmosphere on the local plasma interaction and the Alfvén wings.\nIn our model we have included an asymmetric atmosphere of Europa, the electromagnetic induction in a subsurface water ocean, the plasma production and loss due to electron impact ionization and dissociative recombination. Additionally, our model takes into account different types of model plumes at the south pole.\nOur analysis suggests that the plume modifies the global plasma interaction of Europa. The strength of the modification depends on the physical properties of the plume.",

            "abstract": "The EarthLabs climate project includes curriculum development, teacher professional development, teacher leadership development, and research on student learning, all directed at increasing high school teachers’ and students’ understanding of the factors that shape our planet’s climate. The project has developed four new modules which focus on climate literacy and which are part of the larger Web based EarthLabs collection of Earth science modules. Climate related themes highlighted in the new modules include the Earth system with its positive and negative feedback loops; the range of temporal and spatial scales at which climate, weather, and other Earth system processes occur; and the recurring question, “How do we know what we know about Earth’s past and present climate?” which addresses proxy data and scientific instrumentation.\nEarthLabs climate modules use two central strategies to help students navigate the multiple challenges inherent in understanding climate science. The first is to actively engage students with the content by using a variety of learning modes, and by allowing students to pace themselves through interactive visualizations that address particularly challenging content. The second strategy, which is the focus of this presentation, is to support teachers in a subject area where few have substantive content knowledge or technical skills. Teachers who grasp the processes and interactions that give Earth its climate and the technical skills to engage with relevant data and visualizations are more likely to be successful in supporting students’ understanding of climate’s complexities.\n This presentation will briefly introduce the EarthLabs project and will describe the steps the project takes to prepare climate literate teachers, including Web based resources, teacher workshops, and the development of a cadre of teacher leaders who are prepared to continue leading the workshops after project funding ends.",

            "abstract": "Organic-rich shale is an extremely complex, naturally occurring geo-composite. The heterogeneous nature of organic-rich shale and its anisotropic behavior pose grand challenges for characterization, modeling and engineering design The intricacy of organic-rich shale, in the context of its mechanical and poromechanical properties, originates in the presence of organic/inorganic constituents and their interfaces as well as the occurrence of porosity and elastic anisotropy, at multiple length scales. To capture the contributing mechanisms, of 1st order, responsible for organic-rich shale complex behavior, we introduce an original approach for micromechanical modeling of organic-rich shales which accounts for the effect of maturity of organics on the overall elasticity through morphology considerations. This morphology contribution is captured by means of an effective media theory that bridges the gap between immature and mature systems through the choice of system's microtexture; namely a matrix-inclusion morphology (Mori-Tanaka) for immature systems and a polycrystal/granular morphology for mature systems. Also, we show that interfaces play a role on the effective elasticity of mature, organic-rich shales. The models are calibrated by means of ultrasonic pulse velocity measurements of elastic properties and validated by means of nanoindentation results. Sensitivity analyses using Spearman's Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient shows the importance of porosity and Total Organic Carbon (TOC) as key input parameters for accurate model predictions. These modeling developments pave the way to reach a \"unique\" set of clay properties and highlight the importance of depositional environment, burial and diagenetic processes on overall mechanical and poromechanical behavior of organic-rich shale. These developments also emphasize the importance of understanding and modeling clay elasticity and organic maturity on the overall rock behavior which is of critical importance for a practical rock physics model that accounts for time dependent phenomena which can be employed for seismic inversion.",

            "abstract": "Mass spectrometry of particulates and few micrometer regions of samples by Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) is a very useful analytical tool. However, there are limitations caused by interferences from molecular species, such as hydrides, oxides, and carbides. Above mass 90 u, these interferences (> 104 M/ΔM) can exceed the resolving power of SIMS. Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) is capable of eliminating such molecular ion interferences, but lacks spatial information and generally requires use of negative ions. This requirement limits its sensitivity, since actinide and lanthanide elements preferentially generate positive atomic ions (~104 : 1). The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) has installed a hybrid SIMS-AMS system, using a Single Stage AMS as a replacement for the normal Cameca IMS 4f SIMS electron multiplier detector. The NRL design enables analysis of either positive or negative ions. Thus, this system offers the potential to provide SIMS-like particle and micro-scale analysis without a forest of signals from molecular species, and is capable of measuring important positive atomic ions. This should improve measurement sensitivity and precision to determine isotopic distributions of actinides, lanthanides, and transition metals; and elemental abundances of trace species in particles or small features. Initial measurements show that molecule intensities can be reduced by seven orders of magnitude while atomic ion intensities are only diminished ~50%. We have chosen to call this instrument an atomic ion SIMS, or ai-SIMS, for short. The effect of basic operational parameters such as ion energy, charge state, molecule destruction gas and its pressure will be described, and examples of the benefits and capabilities of ai-SIMS will be presented.",

As an alternate approach,\nwe apply a hybrid 3-D ice sheet-shelf model to the last deglacial retreat in\nthis sector, making use of geologic data of ice extents from ~20,000 years BP\nto present, both for the Amundsen Sea sector and also for the Ross and Weddell\nembayments.\nFollowing recent ice-sheet studies, we use Large-Ensemble statistical\ntechniques, performing sets of ~500 to 1000 runs with varying model parameters.\nThe model is run for the last 20 kyrs on 5 to 20-km grids spanning West\nAntarctica, with lateral boundary conditions from a prior continental-scale\nsimulation. An objective score for each run is calculated using reconstructed\npast grounding lines, shelf extents, relative sea levels, and modern\nconditions. Runs are extended into the future (few millennia) with simple\natmospheric and oceanic forcing. The goal is to produce calibrated\nprobabilistic envelopes of model parameter ranges and simulated ice retreat.\nPreliminary results are presented for Large Ensembles with (i) Latin HyperCube\nsampling in high-dimensional parameter space, and (ii) dense sampling with a\nlower number of parameters.

A common model assumption is that plants in a biome matrix operate at their photosynthetic capacity under optimal climatic conditions. A prescribed biome maximum light use efficiency parameter defines the maximum photosynthetic carbon conversion rate under prevailing climate conditions and is a large source of model uncertainty. Here, we used tower (FLUXNET) eddy covariance measurement based carbon flux data for estimating optimal LUE (LUEopt) over a North American domain. LUEopt was first estimated using tower observed daily carbon fluxes, meteorology and satellite (MODIS) observed fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR). LUEopt was then spatially interpolated over the domain using empirical models derived from independent geospatial data including global plant traits, surface soil moisture, terrain aspect, land cover type and percent tree cover. The derived LUEopt maps were then used as primary inputs to the MOD17 LUE algorithm for regional GPP estimation; these results were evaluated against tower observations and alternate MOD17 GPP estimates determined using Biome-specific LUEopt constants. Estimated LUEopt shows large spatial variability within and among different land cover classes indicated from a sparse North American tower network. Leaf nitrogen content and soil moisture are two important factors explaining LUEopt spatial variability. GPP estimated from spatially explicit LUEopt inputs shows significantly improved model accuracy against independent tower observations (R2 = 0.76; Mean RMSE < 257 g C m-2 yr-1) relative to GPP modeled using biome-specific LUEopt constants (R2 = 34; RMSE = 439 g C m-2 yr-1). We show that general landscape and plant trait information can explain spatial heterogeneity in LUEopt, leading to improved GPP estimates from satellite based LUE models.",

            "abstract": "On average, the Atlantic Hurricane Season consists of 11 named storms, including six hurricanes. However, the 2012 hurricane season tied with the 1887, 1995, 2010, and 2011 seasons for having the third-most named storms on record, with 19 named storms, 10 of which were hurricanes. Seven of these systems made landfall in North America, including Hurricane Isaac and \"Super-Storm\" Sandy. This active season also included Hurricane Nadine, the fourth longest-lived Atlantic hurricane on record. The structure and life cycle of these severe storms can be viewed through the detailed meteorological analyses and forecasts that the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) conducts on a routine basis with our GEOS-5 Atmospheric General Circulation Model (AGCM) system. GMAO routinely produces five-day forecasts twice daily, at 0000 and 1200 UTC, using the GEOS-5 AGCM. The GEOS-5 atmospheric data assimilation system is used to generate near real-time analyses of the atmosphere over the globe every six hours. These analyses provide the initial conditions for the GEOS-5 forecasts. Following the abnormally active 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, one focus has been on the skill of the GEOS-5 forecasts of tropical storms in the Atlantic, East Pacific, and West Pacific.\nIn this presentation it’s shown the results for two of the most destructive storms of the Atlantic season: Hurricanes Isaac and Sandy, and the 2012 Season’s Track Forecast Error. The primary impetus for investigating these two storms was the opportunity to test the ability of the model to reproduce their track and intensity forecast. We observe several features associated with the morphology and inner core of these storms indicative of the capability of the model to reproduce these tropical systems. GEOS-5 predicted Sandy's intensity to within a few hectopascals over much of the life of the storm. The model also predicted some of the finer details of Sandy’s evolution. The forecast from 12z 26Oct2012 appeared to perform the best at forecasting Sandy's intensity. This same forecast correctly predicted the location of Sandy's landfall. Furthermore, this study also shows how the model rapidly creates a closed circulation from a tropical wave up to 24 hours before these TCs are detectible in nature, without any vortex relocation information.",

            "abstract": "It is being increasingly recognized that carbon-nutrient interactions play important roles in regulating terrestrial carbon cycle responses to increasing CO2 in the atmosphere and climate change. Nitrogen-enabled models in CMIP5 indicated that the inclusion of nitrogen cycle reduces CO2 fertilization effect and warming-induced carbon loss from land ecosystems. None of the CMIP5 models has considered phosphorus (P) as a limiting nutrient. Phosphorus has been commonly considered to be the most limiting nutrient in lowland tropical forests. Only recently a few land models have considered P dynamics and C-N-P interactions (CASA-CNP, JSBACH-CNP and CLM-CNP) and these models show strong P limitation in tropical forest responses to increasing atmospheric CO2. In this study, we have performed a set of offline global-scale simulations using CLM-CNP constrained by realistic maps of phosphorus distribution. We examine the influence of including phosphorus cycle dynamics and C-N-P interactions on C-climate feedbacks. We illustrate the spatial patterns of dominant nutrient limitation (N-limited vs. P-limited) on the global scale. We show that P-limitation dominates over most of the tropics and sub-tropics, while N limitation dominates over most of the temperate and high-latitude regions. We also show that phosphorus cycle coupling reduces the sensitivity of net carbon exchange to variations in both temperature and precipitation.",

With the SIZRS dropsonde data, we evaluate the performance of WRF simulations and two forcing data sets: the ERA-Interim reanalysis and the Global Forecast System (GFS) analysis.\nGeneral features of observed mean profiles, such as low-level temperature inversion, low-level jet (LLJ) and specific humidity inversion are reproduced by Polar WRF, ERA-Interim, and GFS. A near-surface warm bias and a low-level moist bias are found in ERA-Interim. WRF significantly improves the mean LLJ, with a lower and stronger jet and a larger turning angle than the forcing. The improvement in the mean LLJ is likely related to the lower values of the boundary layer diffusion in WRF than in ERA-Interim and GFS. The relative humidity profiles have large differences between the observations, the ERA-Interim, and the GFS. The WRF simulated relative humidity closely resembles the forcings, suggesting the need to obtain more and better-calibrated humidity data in this region.\nAn inappropriate thresholding mechanism for sea ice concentrations in the ECMWF model is identified. During summer, sea ice concentrations over large areas are set to zero when the satellite-retrieved sea surface temperature is higher than 274.26 K. This thresholding affects both the ERA-Interim and the ECMWF operational model. The impact of this issue on the atmospheric boundary layer in the marginal ice zone is still unknown.",

            "abstract": "The September 2013 Mw7.7 Balochistan strike-slip earthquake ruptured a ~200 km long segment of the curved Hoshab fault within the Makran accretionary prism – the active zone of convergence between the northward subducting Arabia plate and overriding Eurasia. The Hoshab fault ruptured bilaterally with ~10 m of mean sinistral and ~1.7 m of dip slip along the length of the rupture, quantified jointly from geodetic and seismological observations. This rupture is unusual because the fault dips ~60o towards the focus of a small circle centered in northwest Pakistan, and, despite a 30o increase in obliquity along the curving strike of the fault with respect to Arabia:Eurasia convergence, the ratio of strike and dip slip remain relatively uniform. Static friction prior to rupture was unusually weak ( <0.05) as inferred from topographic and slab profiles, and friction may have approached zero during dynamic rupture, thus permitting in part this unusual event. In this presentation, we argue that the northward dipping Hosab fault defines the northern rim of a structural unit in southeast Makran. This unit rotates – akin to a 2-D ball-and-socket joint – counter clockwise in response to India’s penetration into the Eurasia plate. According to this interpretation, the mechanically weak Makran accretionary prism is subjected to a highly heterogeneous strain and deforms in response to convergence from both the Arabia and India plates. Rotation of the southeast Makran block accounts for complexity in the Chaman fault system and, in principle, reduces the seismic potential near Karachi by accommodating some slip along the southern Ornach-Nal fault. At the same time, geological indicators and along-strike fault slip profiles indicate that the Hoshab fault may also slip as a reverse fault in response to Arabia:Eurasia convergence – indicating that a single fault may accommodate multiple components of strain partitioning in a heterogeneous strain field over several seismic cycles.",

            "abstract": "Identifying and characterizing the sources, pathways and residence times of water and associated constituents is critical to developing improved understanding of watershed-stream connections and hydrological/ecological/biogeochemical models. To date the most robust information is obtained from integrated studies that combine natural tracers (e.g. isotopes, geochemical tracers) with controlled chemical tracer (e.g., bromide, dyes) or colloidal tracer (e.g., carboxilated microspheres, tagged clay particles, microorganisms) applications. In the presented study we explore how understanding of sources and flow pathways of water derived from natural tracer studies can be improved and expanded in space and time by simultaneously introducing man-made, synthetic DNA-based microtracers. The microtracer used were composed of polylactic acid (PLA) microspheres into which short strands of synthetic DNA and paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles are incorporated. Tracer experiments using both natural tracers and the DNA-based microtracers were conducted in the sub-arctic, glacierized Tarfala (21.7 km2) catchment in northern Sweden. Isotopic hydrograph separations revealed that even though storm runoff was dominated by pre-event water the event water (i.e. rainfall) contributions to streamflow increased throughout the summer season as glacial snow cover decreased. This suggests that glaciers are a major source of the rainwater fraction in streamflow. Simultaneous injections of ten unique DNA-based microtracers confirmed this hypothesis and revealed that the transit time of water traveling from the glacier surface to the stream decreased fourfold over the summer season leading to instantaneous rainwater contributions during storm events. These results highlight that integrating simultaneous tracer injections (injecting tracers at multiple places at one time) with traditional tracer methods (sampling multiple times at one place) rather than using either approach in isolation can provide new insights into the source, timing and mixing of water moving through hydrologic systems.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that increased nutrient loading and eutrophication can impact the production of monomethylmercury (MMHg) in marine systems. Experimental plots in Great Sippewisset Marsh (GSM), Falmouth, Massachusetts USA, have been chronically treated with a mixed fertilizer during the growing season since 1971, providing nutrients and other elements, including mercury (Hg) to the salt marsh. To assess the retention, release and methylation of Hg in these marsh sediments in response to fertilization, we collected cores from control, low, high, and extra high fertilization plots across low and high marsh settings. We determined total mercury (HgT) and MMHg concentration and accumulation rates and compared them to those of atmospheric deposition and the loading from the mixed fertilizer. Environmental DNA was extracted from the core sub-samples and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect three genes of interest: merA (Hg(II) reducing), hgcA (Hg(II) methylating) and dsrAB (dissimilatory sulfite reduction). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) will be performed in order to overlay the abundance and diversity of the three genes to the Hg profiles and speciation metadata. By comparing the genomic data to the geochemical patterns within the treatment plots we can develop a greater sense of how Hg cycling has changed as a result of fertilization and the overall response of GSM to long-term nutrient loading.",

            "abstract": "The ability for reactive constituents to mix is often the key limiting factor for the completion of reactions across a huge range of scales in a variety of media. In flowing systems, deformation and shear enhance mixing by bringing constituents into closer proximity, thus increasing reaction potential. Accurately quantifying this enhanced mixing is key to predicting reactions, and typically is done by observing or simulating scalar transport. To eliminate this computationally expensive step, we use a Lagrangian stochastic framework to derive the enhancement to reaction potential by calculating the collocation probability of particle pairs in a heterogeneous flow field accounting for deformations. We relate the enhanced reaction potential to three well-known flow topology metrics (Okubo-Weiss, finite-time Lyapunov exponent, and right Cauchy-Green tensor) and demonstrate that it is best correlated to the largest eigenvalue of the right Cauchy-Green tensor. The reason is that this eigenvalue reflects compression and shear but ignores rotation, which does not enhance mixing. We demonstrate that regions of high shear and/or compression do indeed have higher rates of reaction in particle-tracking reaction simulations, but this is not necessarily seen in traditional Eulerian simulations due to numerical (artificial) mixing and the amplification of these errors by non-linear reactions.",

            "abstract": "For the past three decades, the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Division of Undergraduate Education (DUE) has administered a succession of programs intended to improve undergraduate STEM education for all students. The IUSE (Improving Undergraduate STEM Education) program is the latest program in this succession, and reflects an expanded, NSF-wide effort to make sustainable improvements in STEM education on a national scale. The origins and thinking behind IUSE can be in part traced back to precursor programs including: ILI (Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement), CCD (Course and Curriculum Development), UFE (Undergraduate Faculty Enhancement), CCLI (Course, Curriculum and Laboratory Improvement), and TUES (Transforming Undergraduate Education in STEM), all of which sought to support faculty efforts to investigate and improve curriculum and instructional practice in undergraduate STEM education, and to disseminate effective STEM educational practices for broad adoption. IUSE, like its predecessor programs, is open to all STEM fields, and as such is intended to support improvements in geoscience education, spanning the atmospheric, ocean, and Earth sciences, as well as in environmental science, GIS science, climate change and sustainability/resilience. An emphasis on discipline-based research on learning that had origins in the CCLI and TUES programs is a new priority area in IUSE, with the ambition that projects will take advantage of the integrated expertise of domain scientists, educational practioners, and experts in learning science.\nWe trace and describe the history of undergraduate education efforts with an emphasis placed on the recently introduced IUSE program. Understanding the origin of DUE's IUSE program can provide insights for faculty interested in developing proposals for submission and gain a greater appreciation of trends and priorities within the division.",

The cities are subject to frequent dust storms presenting a hazard to local infrastructure and health, including synoptic-scale dust events during winter and spring, and dusty outflows from convective storms (haboobs) primarily during the summer. We evaluate particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) concentrations over a decade of convective and non-convective dust events, based on hourly aerosol data collected by Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) continuous air monitors in El Paso cross-referenced to weather observations from the USA National Weather Service. A total of 219 dust events (95 convective and 124 non-convective) events occurred between 2001 and 2010. The PM2.5/PM10 ratio was significantly higher (proportionally greater concentration of fine aerosols) in convective episodes and during summertime events than during non-convective dust events and dust episodes in other seasons, although overall concentrations of both PM2.5 and PM10 were higher in the non-convective events, which were also longer-lasting. These differences in fine/coarse aerosol ratios are likely related to different atmospheric stability conditions, and/or different mechanisms of dust particle entrainment and transport in haboobs versus non-convective dust events. Since visibility degradation and adverse human health effects are known to be exacerbated by to fine aerosol concentrations, thunderstorm-related dust events may present a proportionally greater hazard.",

            "abstract": "A number of studies have examined rates of gorge formation, nick point retreat, and the controls on those rates via bedrock erodibility, the effectiveness of bedrock erosion mechanisms and the role of hillslope processes. Most findings are based on conceptual / empirical models or long term landscape analysis; but studies of recent quantifiable events are scarce yet highly valuable. Here we present expert eye witness account and quantitative survey of large and rapid fluvial erosion events that occurred over an artificially created waterfall at a spillway mouth. In 6 years a ~270 m long, ~100 m deep and ~100 to 160 m wide canyon was carved, and ~1.58 x106 m3 of granite bedrock was removed from the spillway site. Available flow data indicates that the erosion took place under unremarkable flood discharge conditions. The analysis of historic topographic maps enables the reconstruction of the former topography and successive erosion events, enabling the quantification of bedrock erosion amounts, and rates. Analysis of bedrock erodibility and discontinuity patterns demonstrates that the bedrock is mechanically strong, and that similar rock strength and fracture patterns are found throughout the region. It is apparent that structural pre-conditioning through fracture density and orientation in relation to flow and slope direction is of paramount importance in the gorge development.\nThe presented example provides an exceptional opportunity for studying the evolution process of a bedrock canyon and to precisely measure the rate of bedrock channel erosion over a six year period. Results illustrate the highly episodic nature of the erosion and highlight several key observations for the adjustability of bedrock rivers. The observations have implications for the efficiency of bedrock erosion and raise important questions about incision rates, driving mechanisms and timescale assumptions’ in models of landscape change.",

            "abstract": "At the global scale permafrost temperatures are increasing, leading to a thickening of the active layer and an increase in the amount of previously immobilised C exposed to microbial decay and subsequent release to the atmosphere. Against the backdrop of this overall trend, perturbations to permafrost systems caused by wildfires or thermokarst driven wetland formation can cause dramatic shifts in the C exchange of these ecosystems as a result of the changes in plant communities and soil thermal regimes they cause. These dynamic components of permafrost landscapes are often neglected in coupled climate-C models. However, a clear understanding of the impact of these perturbations on C cycling is crucial if we are to accurately predict future permafrost feedbacks to climate change. This is particularly pertinent given that the frequency of both forest fires and thermokarst formation is likely to increase with future climate warming.\nIn order to assess the impact of these perturbations on C cycling we established paired burned and unburned spruce forest and paired peat plateau and thaw feature field sites near Whitehorse, YT and Yellowknife, NT within the boreal region of Canada.\nAt each site tree photosynthetic biomass was quantified using DBH based allometric scaling equations. A combination of percentage cover surveys, biomass harvests, and leaf area determination were used to calculate understory and wetland photosynthetic biomass. Measurements of spruce and understory photosynthesis and plant and soil respiration were made using specialised acrylic chambers and an IRGA.\nCombining these data has allowed us to determine the impact of thermokarst formation and wildfire on C exchange with the atmosphere. This has allowed us to assess whether the dramatic increase in plant productivity between peat plateau and wetland habitats has the potential to offset thermokarst associated C losses. We have also gained an understanding of whether increases in light availability for understory vegetation in early to mid-successional post-burn sites can partially offset the loss of photosynthetic capacity caused by the lack of a tree canopy and increased soil respiration resulting from active layer thickening. Our findings provide important insights into the impact of two key perturbations on C cycling in permafrost systems.",

            "abstract": "When the temperature of land surface is lower than that of air and deeper soils, water vapor gathers toward the ground surface where dew maybe formed depending on the prevailing dew point and wind speed. Some plants are able to absorb the dew and vapor flow while the soil can readily absorb both. Certain animals such as desert beetles and ants harvest the dew or fog for daily survival. Recently, it is also realized that the dew and vapor flow can be a life-saving amount of water for plant survival at the driest seasons of the year in arid and semi-arid regions.\nResearches are conducted to quantify the amount of near-surface vapor flow in arid and semi-arid regions in China and USA. Quantitative leaf water absorption and desorption functions were derived based on laboratory experiments. Results show that plant leaves absorb and release water at different speeds depending on species and varieties. The “ideal” native plants in the dry climates can quickly absorb water and slowly release it. This water-holding capacity of plant is characterized by the absorption and desorption functions derived for plant physiology and water balance studies.\nField studies are conducted to measure the dynamic vapor flow movements from the atmosphere and the groundwater table to soil surface. Results show that dew is usually formed on soil and plant surfaces during the daily hours when the temperature gradients are inverted toward the soil surface. The amount of dew harvested using gravels on the soil surface was enough to support water melon agriculture on deserts. The vapor flow can be effectively intercepted by artificially seeded plants in semi-arid regions forming new forests. New studies are attempted to quantify the role of vapor flow for the survival of giant sequoias in the southern Sierra Nevada Mountains of California.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic and tracer tomography have evolved as a family of promising hydrogeological field investigation techniques to assess spatial variability of hydraulic parameters. Tomography uses a set of different source-receiver combinations to spatially resolve heterogeneity in an aquifer, which would not be possible using standard field methods such as single well pumping tests. While hydraulic tomography is based on hydraulic pressure variations, tracer tomography uses the tracer travel time from a source (point injection) to a receiver (sampling point) to determine hydraulic properties. Implementation of tracer tests in the field is more challenging than hydraulic testing, and thus the potential of tracers for tomographic aquifer reconstruction is much less explored. Moreover, detailed simulation of solute transport during inversion is computationally demanding and strategies are needed to overcome this bottleneck. The proposed new methodology addresses shortcomings of available inversion procedures, such as simplified conceptual assumptions, limited application windows, and high computational demand. It is based on the use of pilot points, which are widely applied for calibration of highly parameterized groundwater models. These points are, however, not treated as pre-defined, fixed variables. Our proposed implementation dynamically adjusts the number and coordinates of the pilot points during iterative inversion. This yields a self-adaptive procedure that is tailored to the specific structures reconstructed in a tomogram. For the description of tracer transport, the use of an expressive, computationally efficient proxy is suggested. This proxy makes use of travel time calculations based solely on steady state and a path-finding algorithm that strongly speeds up the inversion procedure. This concept is embedded in a stochastic inversion framework, from which an ensemble of inverted models, which honor all available hydraulic and solute transport data, is derived. The proposed methodology is capable of integrating complex and soft geological knowledge, and various types of field observations. Its viability is demonstrated on both a synthetic example and a tomographic field test in a sedimentary aquifer.",

This ensemble (“snow-darkening case (SDC)”), consisting of ten parallel simulations (differing only in their initial conditions) spanning 2002-2011, is compared here to a corresponding ensemble with all snow-darkening effects disabled (“non-SDC”). We focus particularly on the production of extremes associated with snow darkening. To identify regions of interest over Eurasia, we first rank the 100 separate spring (MAM) or summer (JJA) values of a given quantity in each combined 100-yr data (i.e., 10-yr x 10-ensemble), and then compute the differences of the 90th percentile values between SDC and non-SDC. For spring, large differences are seen in a specific area of Europe and Central Asia (ECA), and for summer, they are seen for an area in the Russian Arctic (RA). The next step in our analysis addresses the month-by-month variation of the percentile differences within these identified regions – for each month, and for a given meteorological or hydrological variable, we determined the SDC percentile that corresponds to the 90th percentile value found for the non-SDC ensemble. For example, in the RA domain, the surface air temperature corresponding to the 90th percentile in the non-SDC ensemble has a consistently lower percentile in the SDC data – not only during spring and summer through the increased absorption of radiation by snow polluted with dust, black carbon, and organic carbon, but also in the post-snow season through some form of memory in the system. The temperature extremes in the SDC ensemble thus exceed those of the non-SDC ensemble throughout the year. This analysis supports the idea that the consideration of snow darkening effect in global models is important for simulating key aspects of climate variability and extremes, even during snow-free seasons.",

            "abstract": "Forests in the US upper Midwest and northeast are broadly undergoing a gradual ecological transition in which short-lived tree species decline and give way to longer-lived species. Environmental changes are paralleling these ecological shifts with potential consequences for the region’s carbon (C) sink status. Long-term C flux measurements from the University of Michigan Biological Station Ameriflux core site meteorological tower (UMB) are demonstrating how changes in forest structure and composition, and the environment combine to constrain net ecosystem production (NEP) over decadal timescales.\nAnnual NEP of the UMB forest increased by nearly 1 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 from 1999 through 2013, while leaf area index (LAI) declined by a half unit. The UMB NEP time-series is characterized by several years of relative stability followed by a variable upward trend beginning in 2007. While growing season photosynthetic active radiation explains a majority of the interannual variation in NEP, the recent rise in production coincides with an abrupt decline in the LAI of early successional aspen (Populus spp.) and birch (Betula papyrifera), and a reciprocal rapid increase in the LAI of later successional and longer lived red oak (Quercus rubra) and red maple (Acer Rubrum). The product of apparent quantum yield, a metric of light-use efficiency, of the canopy and maximum NEP increased as LAI declined with the senescence of aspen and birch, suggesting that shifts in canopy composition improved how efficiently light is used to drive forest C uptake. We conclude that an upward trend in NEP at the UMB site is jointly caused by environmental and ecological change, the latter of which is progressively altering the physiology of the canopy.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic is one of the most climatically sensitive regions of the Earth. Climate models robustly project the Arctic to warm 2-3 times faster than the global mean surface temperature—termed polar warming amplification (PWA)—but also display the widest range of surface temperature projections in this region. The response of the Arctic to increased CO2 modulates the response in tropical and extra-tropical regions through teleconnections in the atmospheric circulation. An increased frequency of extreme precipitation events in the northern mid-latitudes, for example, has been linked to the change in the background equator-to-pole temperature gradient implied by PWA. Understanding the Arctic climate system is therefore important for predicting global climate change. The ice albedo feedback is the primary mechanism driving PWA, however cloud and dynamical feedbacks significantly contribute. These feedback mechanisms, however, do not operate independently. How do clouds respond to variations in sea ice? This critical question is addressed by combining sea ice, cloud, and radiation observations from satellites—including CERES, CloudSAT, CALIPSO, MODIS, and microwave radiometers—to investigate sea ice-cloud interactions at the interannual timescale in the Arctic. Cloud characteristics are strongly tied to the atmospheric dynamic and thermodynamic state. Therefore, the sensitivity of Arctic cloud characteristics—vertical distribution and optical properties—to sea ice anomalies is computed within atmospheric dynamic and thermodynamic regimes. Results indicate that the cloud response to changes in sea ice concentration differs significantly between atmospheric state regimes. This suggests that (1) the atmospheric dynamic and thermodynamic characteristics and (2) the characteristics of the marginal ice zone are important for determining the seasonal forcing by cloud on sea ice variability.",

Coordinated tracking can effectively document program impact, inform programmatic improvement, and identifying gaps in the internship effort. Tracking can also strengthen diversity efforts and the retention of students from underrepresented groups. Continuous follow-up and guidance can only be provided to students if we know where they are, what they are doing and what they need in order to stay engaged in the field. The SOARS Program at the National Center for Atmospheric Research has supported undergraduate students for over 18 years to enter and succeed in graduate school. Over 85% of SOARS participants have transitioned to geoscience graduate programs or the STEM workforce. The SOARS mission is to broaden participation in the atmospheric and related sciences by engaging students from groups historically under-represented in science, including Black or African-American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Hispanic or Latino, female, first-generation college students, and students with disabilities. SOARS relies on proven intervention strategies such as multi-year research experiences, multifaceted mentoring, and a strong learning community. Fostering relationships developed during this time using a wider range of technologies and program longevity play important roles in tracking participants over time. This presentation will highlight significant program results and share the tracking and evaluation techniques utilized in SOARS.",

We are solving this topic using guns and magnetic properties of projectiles. We use magnetic remanence as a tool to reconstruct at least part of the history of moving bodies. We are trying to characterize magnetic acquisition/loss of the bullets and than use acquired knowledge for bullet and meteorite tracing. The bullet is heated to high temperature by hot gases during firing. As it cools it gets its unique remanent magnetization signature. A unique signature is made out of multiple magnetic vectors, which are related to both direction of the geomagnetic field and direction of the trajectory of the projectile. The information provided by remanent magnetization can be used to retrieve at least some characteristics of the trajectory of the projectile. A similar process applies to meteorites, which are heated after entry into the atmosphere. Measurement results from bullets are being used for understanding the final history of meteorite descend. Our research is carried out experimentally. We made system for bullet magnetic modification that we use to track specific process of magnetic acquisition/loss. We have found significant potential in their magnetic remanence acquisition by choosing specific magnetic carriers and their grain size as part of the bullet composition.",

In an effort to retain traditional relationships with the land, the San Carlos Apache Tribe is working to restore the land to approximate pre-European settlement conditions using a combination of mechanical thinning and fire. Restoring the historic fire return interval in forests and woodlands with the current unnaturally high fuel loads in times of prolonged drought is a challenge in the Southwest US, and therefore creating an accurate forest biomass baseline is very important for future carbon balance projections considering ongoing climate change. Forest aboveground biomass was estimated from active and passive remote sensing sources including high point density airborne lidar, high and moderate spatial resolution WorldView-2 and Landsat 8 satellites. General (all species inclusive) and species-specific biomass models were created using active and passive remote sensing data sources. Across all species, lidar derived height and intensity metrics in combination provided the most robust estimate for aboveground biomass, producing models with R-square values above 0.8 and RMSE less than 14 Mg ha-1. Landsat 8 based species-specific aboveground biomass models yielded errors ranging from 9 to 28 Mg ha-1, whereas WorldView-2 based model yielded errors of 17 to 44 Mg ha-1. Structural information extracted from lidar provided accurate estimates for fine-scale aboveground biomass mapping, while spectral information derived from Landsat 8 can be used for large scale biomass mapping beyond lidar spatial coverage. Long term forest carbon records could be used to direct forest resource management efforts (e.g., thinning and burning) to avoid catastrophic fires, retain stored carbon and maintain long-term carbon sink strength of forest ecosystems.",

Long-term datasets reveal important patterns for scientists to explain and are essential for testing hypotheses undreamt of at the time monitoring scheme was set up. Many environmental processes take place over relatively long periods of time; very often, subtle processes are embedded within highly variable systems so that their weak signal cannot be extracted without a long record.\nSlapton Ley is a freshwater coastal lagoon in SW England. The Ley is part of a National Nature Reserve, wetland 116 ha in area which is divided into two basins: the Higher Ley (39 ha) is mainly reed swamp; the Lower Ley (77 ha) is open water. In the 1960s it became apparent that the Ley was becoming increasingly eutrophic. In order to gauge water, sediment and nutrient inputs into the lake, measurements began on the main catchments in late 1969. Continuous monitoring of discharge and a weekly water-sampling programme have been maintained by the Slapton Ley Field Centre ever since. The monitoring programme has been supplemented by a number of research projects which have sought to identify the salient hydrological processes operating within the Slapton catchments and to relate these to the delivery of sediment and solute to the stream system.\nThe nitrate issue has been of particular interest at Slapton; although many longer series exist for large rivers like the Thames, the long record of nitrate data for the Slapton catchments is unique in Britain for small rural basins. Other issues to be explored will be the phosphorus legacy in lake sediments and a long-term decline in lake pH. The Slapton water quality record has confirmed that undesirable changes are taking place, revealed evidence of important patterns to be explained, allowed testing of new hypotheses (e.g. links with land-use change) and helped provide strategies for more successful management of the catchment area.",

            "abstract": "As on the terrestrial planets, key clues to the origin of Titan’s enigmatic atmosphere are contained in the abundances of noble gases and stable isotopes in the atmosphere. The Huygens GCMS measured the abundances of 40Ar, 36Ar, and 22Ne (tentatively); as well as the nitrogen and carbon isotopic compositions of atmospheric N2 and CH4, respectively. No isotopes of Kr or Xe were detected (<10 ppbv). Cassini CIRS has provided us with the D/H ratio in CH4. Here, I attempt to explain these data by developing the hypothesis that the noble gases, nitrogen, and methane originated in the rocky core of Titan [1]. The presence of 40Ar demonstrates that volatile species can be delivered from the deep interior to the atmosphere. Consistent with [2], I find that Titan’s primordial core should have contained sufficient 36Ar and 22Ne to explain their reported abundances. By extrapolating this model, I provide a new explanation for why the GCMS failed to detect Kr or Xe, as the predicted mixing ratios of 84Kr and 132Xe are ~0.2 ppbv and ~0.01 ppbv, respectively. I find that nitrogen should be outgassed similarly to argon, while krypton can serve as a geochemical proxy for methane, given the similar volatilities of these pairs of substances. This allows me to deduce that geochemical reactions in Titan’s core could have generated enough N2 and CH4 from accreted NH3 and CO2, respectively. A hydrothermal origin of atmospheric nitrogen is also supported by the similarity in N isotopes between Titan’s N2 and cometary NH3 [3]. I find that the isotopic ratios in methane can be explained by low-temperature (~300 K) equilibria with liquid water and the alteration mineral calcite. Looking toward the future, this model predicts 12C/13C ≈ 84 in dry ice, and D/H ≈ 170 ppm in water ice on Titan’s surface. ",

            "abstract": "The impact of the SAL on the development and intensification of hurricanes has garnered significant attention in recent years. Many past studies have shown that synoptic outbreaks of Saharan dust, which usually occur from late spring to early fall and can extend from western Africa across the Atlantic Ocean into the Caribbean, can have impacts on hurricane genesis and subsequent intensity change. The Hurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel (HS3) mission is a multiyear NASA field campaign with the goal of improving understanding of hurricane formation and intensity change. One of HS3's primary science goals is to obtain measurements to help determine the extent to which the Saharan air layer impacts storm intensification. HS3 uses two of NASA's unmanned Global Hawk aircrafts equipped with three instruments each to measure characteristics of the storm environment and inner core.\nThe Goddard microphysics and longwave/shortwave schemes in the NASA Unified Weather Research and Forecasting (NU-WRF) model have been coupled in real-time with the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) model in WRF-Chem to account for the direct (radiation) and indirect (microphysics) impact. NU-WRF with interactive aerosol-cloud-radiation physics is used to generate 30-member ensemble simulations of Nadine (2012) with and without the aerosol interactions. Preliminary conclusions related to the impact of the SAL on the evolution of Nadine from the HS3 observations and model output will be described.",

            "abstract": "The roles of tropical wetlands in the global carbon (C) cycle are still poorly understood, especially in seasonally flooded forests that are expected to be important sinks for atmospheric CO2. We measured soil CO2 efflux during the wet-dry transition period in a seasonally flooded palm-dominated forest (locally known as Acorizal) to determine the effect of litter input and seasonal hydrology. Measurements were performed monthly as part of a field litter manipulation experiment consisting of three treatments (litter removal, litter addition, and control; n = 6 plots per treatment), and our research objectives were to determine how soil CO2 efflux varied as a function of (1) litter input, (2) root density, and (3) seasonal variation in soil water content. We found that litter addition significantly increased soil CO2 efflux, but there was no relationship between root density and soil CO2 efflux. Efflux was highest during the wet season and declined as soil water content declined. Our data demonstrate that variations in litter inputs and soil water content are important controls on soil CO2 efflux in seasonally flooded tropical forests.",

            "abstract": "Declines in the amount of groundwater in storage as a result of groundwater development have led to concerns about the future availability of freshwater to meet drinking-water, agricultural, industrial, and environmental needs. Industry and public drinking-water suppliers have increasingly turned to nontraditional groundwater sources, such as moderately saline (brackish) groundwater, to supplement or replace the use of freshwater. Despite the growing demand for alternative water sources, a significant potential nontraditional water resource, brackish groundwater, was last assessed almost 50 years ago. The recently (2013) initiated USGS National Brackish Groundwater Assessment, which is part of the National Water Census, will provide an updated systematic national assessment of the distribution of significant brackish groundwater resources and critical information about the hydrogeologic and chemical characterization of brackish aquifers.\nAs part of this study, updated national-scale maps of total dissolved-solids concentrations and chemical water types will be created using data from about 400,000 sites that have been compiled from over 30 national, regional, and state sources. However, available data are biased toward freshwater and shallow systems. Preliminary analysis indicates that about 75 percent of the dissolved-solids concentrations are from freshwater aquifers, and more than 80 percent represent depths less than 500 feet below land surface. Several techniques are used to extend the information contained in the compiled data. For about half of the sites, dissolved-solids concentration was estimated from specific conductance using statistical relations. In addition, for areas where chemical data are not available, regression models are being developed to predict the occurrence of brackish groundwater based on geospatial data such as geology and other variables that are correlated to dissolved-solids concentrations.",

            "abstract": "Recently, attention has been given to an upper ocean feature known as the Barrier Layer, which has been shown to impact meteorological phenomena from ENSO to tropical cyclones by suppressing vertical mixing, which reduces sea surface cooling and enhances surface heat fluxes. The calculation defines the Barrier Layer as the difference between the Isothermal Layer Depth (ILD) and Mixed Layer Depth (MLD). Proper representation of these features relies on precise observations of SSS to attain accurate measurements of the MLD and subsequently, the BLT. Compared to the many available in situ SSS measurements, the NASA Aquarius salinity mission currently obtains the closest observations to the true SSS. The role of subsurface features will be better understood through increased accuracy of SSS measurements. In this study BLT estimates are derived from satellite measurements using a multilinear regression model (MRM) in the Indian Ocean. The MRM relates BLT to satellite derived SSS, sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface height anomalies (SSHA). Besides being a variable that responds passively to atmospheric conditions, SSS significantly controls upper ocean density and therefore the MLD. The formation of a Barrier Layer can lead to possible feedbacks that impact the atmospheric component of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), as stated as one of the three major hypotheses of the DYNAMO field campaign. This layer produces a stable stratification, reducing vertical mixing, which influences surface heat fluxes and thus could possibly impact atmospheric conditions during the MJO. Establishing the magnitude and extent of SSS variations during the MJO will be a useful tool for data assimilation into models to correctly represent both oceanic thermodynamic characteristics and atmospheric processes during intraseasonal variations.",

            "abstract": "The high-resolution seismic profiling during cruise 32 of the RV “Akademik Ioffe” (2010) discovered a large elongated contourite drift on the ridge of the Rio Grande fracture zone (Brazil Basin, western South Atlantic). This sedimentary body with a thickness up to 300 m, named Ioffe drift, is traced at water depth range from 3790 to 3980 m. Five seismic units are distinguished within the upper drift structure recorded to a depth of 60 mbsf. The seismic units are separated by angular discontinuities. The sediment core AI-2436 (25°51.6’S, 34°01.40’W, water depth 3800 m) retrieved near the drift top recovers about 6 m of nanno-foraminiferal ooze intercalated with foraminiferal sand interbeds. According to the planktonic foraminiferal and nannofossil stratigraphy, the sediment record embraces about 3 My of the Ioffe drift history, from the Late Pliocene to present. Absence of several foraminiferal and nannofossil zones in the core section indicates long-term hiatuses. Some zones are thicker here while others are reduced as compared to those on the nearby Rio Grande Rise. This suggests reworking of the biogenic material in the drift. The Ioffe drift was formed as a result of transport and deposition of biogenic calcareous material by the eastern branch of the Antarctic bottom water (AABW) flow. The biogenic calcareous material is mainly derived from the Rio Grande Rise where planktonic foraminiferal and nannofossil assemblages identical to those in core AI-2436 are studied at the DSDP site 516 (Barash et al., 1983). We suggest that the grain-size distribution of the calcareous sediments roughly corresponding to the foraminiferal/nannofossil ratio reflects the bottom currents velocity variations. Very high current velocities result in erosion and stratigraphic hiatuses. Angular unconformities in seismic profiles indicate episodes of intensified AABW flow velocity which led to the drift migration.\nThe study was supported by RFBR, research projects 14-05-31357-mol_a, 14-05-00744-a.\nBarash, M.S., Oskina, N.S., Blyum, N., S., 1983.

            "abstract": "Several recent genetic studies have revealed that many morphologically defined planktonic foraminiferal species contain multiple distinct cryptic or pseudocryptic genetic variants. In some cases, such as with the genetic variants of Globigerinoides ruber, past taxonomic “lumping” may be easily revised within the framework of the morphospecies concept. However, some planktonic foraminiferal cryptic species are not easily differentiated from one another based on identifiable morphological differences, as is the case with Orbulina universa cryptic species (Morard et al., 2009). Based on recent findings, it is believed that several of these O. universa cryptic species differ in their habitat preferences (Darling et al., 1999,2000; de Vargas et al., 1999, 2001), and the lumping of these cryptic species could possibly account for a significant amount of the noise observed in various paleoclimate records derived from this species (Kucera and Darling, 2002). The current study uses foraminiferal morphometrics (area density, Marshall et al., 2013, thickness and weight-diameter realtionships) to identify distinct groupings of individual Orbulina universa specimens collected from sediment trap samples in the Cariaco Basin, Venezuela. The study reveals three distinct groups of individuals, varying in their test thicknesses and pore space distribution, which likely correspond to the previously identified cryptic species of O. universa. We find significant differences in the isotopic compositions of these groupings – suggesting that the identified morphotypes differ in their habitat preferences. These morphotypes also exhibit different relationships with the measured hydrographic parameters and their relative distribution can be linked to changes in upwelling and non-upwelling hydrographic regimes. We agree with the results of previous studies that suggest different cryptic species should not be treated as ecophenotypic variants and need to be distinguished from one another during proxy development and application.",

Drawn from various InTeGrate workshops and programming, the Portal organizes these resources to illuminate a variety of career opportunities and pathways to both traditional and non-traditional jobs that support a sustainable future. Informed from a variety of sources including employers, practitioners, faculty, students, reports, and articles, the pages explore five facets: (1) sustainability across the disciplines, (2) workforce preparation, (3) professional communication, (4) teaching and teaching careers, and (5) the future of green research and technology. The first three facets explore how sustainability is integrated across disciplines and how sustainability and ‘green’ jobs are available in a wide range of traditional and non-traditional workplaces within and beyond science. They provide students guidance in preparing for this sustainability workforce, including where to learn about jobs and how to pursue them, advice for strengthening their job applications, and how to build a set of skills that employers seek. This advice encompasses classroom skills as well as those acquired and strengthened as part of extracurricular or workplace experiences. The fourth facet, aimed at teaching assistants with little or no experience as well as at students who are interested in pursuing teaching as a career, provides information and resources about teaching. The fifth facet explores future directions of technology and the need for innovations in the workforce of the future to address sustainability issues. We seek your input and invite you to explore the Portal at: serc.carleton.edu/integrate/students/",

The empirical model of hiss waves is used to compute quasi-linear pitch-angle diffusion coefficients for energetic, relativistic, and ultra-relativistic electrons in the energy range of 1 keV to 10 MeV. In our calculations, we account for changes in hiss wave normal angle and plasma density with increasing λ. Electron lifetimes are then calculated from the diffusion coefficients and parameterized as a function of energy, Kp, and L.

            "abstract": "Rising global temperatures are profoundly impacting alpine environments by shifting the precipitation type and the timing of peak snowmelt runoff. Uncertainty in the magnitude of these shifts translates to uncertainty in how climate change affects timing of snowmelt runoff, and hence availability of surface water during the remainder of the year. Integrated hydrologic models are useful tools for capturing these feedbacks by closing the loop between atmosphere, land surface, and subsurface dynamics. Recent integrated models have been used to predict streamflow response to climate change in mountain basins, however these models assume that shallow, local flow paths comprise the majority of recharge and baseflow to streams. Several studies have challenged this assumption with discordant groundwater ages and hysteresis loops, suggesting that deep, regional flow paths may play a more substantial role even at the local stream scale. This would have considerable implications for predicted responses to climate change in alpine basins, as deep, regional groundwater would initially buffer perturbations, but exhibit greater memory over the long-term. The goal of this study is to understand how various hydrogeological settings will control the relative feedbacks to climate change.\nThis research uses three simplified, conceptual hillslope models: a “fast” draining, low storage, granodiorite similar to that of of the Sierra Nevada or Himalayan mountain range, a “slow” draining, high storage basalt of the Cascade or Andes Range, and a vertically homogeneous “base” case. The relative response of these hillslopes to three future climate scenarios: warm, warm and dry, and warm and wet are tested using ParFlow, an integrated surface water-groundwater model, coupled with CLM, a land surface model. These models will help quantify the relative feedbacks of deep groundwater in various hydrogeologic settings and will ultimately be scaled up to assess the 3-D, transient response of deep groundwater to climate change in a regional alpine system.",

            "abstract": "A comprehensive set of analyses based on observations and models are presented to show that significant changes occurred in broad areas of the low-latitude Pacific in the early 1990s. Associated with this early-1990s climate shift, the strength of ocean-atmosphere coupling in the eastern subtropical Pacific intensified, which resulted in a shift in the location of El Nino events from the eastern Pacific (EP) to the central Pacific (CP). The CP type of El Nino events are accompanied by stronger subtropical precursors than the EP type of El Nino.\nOur investigations indicate that this early-1990s climate shift is characterized by an intensification of the subtropical Pacific High and is linked to a phase change of the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) that occurred at about the same time. The talk will describe the sequence of physical processes that enable the AMO to impact the low-latitude Pacific climate and its variability.",

            "abstract": "Elevated low-relief landscapes are often interpreted as “relic” and characteristics such as low erosion rates or low relief are assumed to reflect pre-uplift tectonic conditions. We present here an alternative model whereby high elevation, low-relief landscapes develop in situ by purely fluvial processes. We argue that changes in tectonic regime result in change of uplift rate, but also deform the surface, thereby inducing changes in the river channel network through capture and divide migration. Loss of drainage area leads to lower erosion rate through lower river discharge and thus to higher surface uplift rate as erosion fails to keep up with tectonic uplift. Branches of a river network that lose area are thus raised to higher elevation where they have a predisposition towards further area loss, triggering a positive feedback, potentially including runaway conditions in which erosion rates and drainage area tend towards zero. Such conditions produce high-elevation, low relief, low erosion-rate branches of a river network that could be misconstrued as relic landscapes. We test this model by analyzing river profiles of several previously identified relic landscapes in the eastern Tibetan plateau region and in the Central Range of Taiwan. We apply two tests. First we check kinematic wave travel times to the relic and surrounding regions to test if there is a common uplift history with an increase in uplift rate that has not yet reached the relic. Second, we measure the channel steepness and channel profiles inside and outside the relic region to test for divide mobility and evidence of area capture. In every case examined, we find no common uplift history and widespread evidence that divides surrounding a relic landscape are moving inward, pirating drainage area and lowering erosion rates. This supports the model for in situ formation of these landscapes by progressive drainage area loss.",

            "abstract": "Understanding three-dimensional (3D) transport in ocean eddies is important for processes at a variety of scales, ranging from plankton production to climate variability. It is well known that geophysical vortices are subject to various hydrodynamic instabilities. Yet the influence of these instabilities on 3D material transport in vortex systems is not well investigated. Focusing on barotropic, inertial and 3D instabilities, we analyze these instabilities with normal-mode method, and reproduce their characteristics via highly-resolved numerical simulations using a spectral element Navier-Stokes solver. By comparing the simulation results of stable and unstable vortices, we investigate the joint impacts of instabilities on 3D transport through three major aspects: (i) energy transfer, (ii) overturning transport of the secondary circulation, and (iii) rates of vertical exchange and mixing. It is found that instabilities can enhance local nonlinear interactions and cause the kinetic energy wavenumber spectrum to have slopes between the conventional -5/3 and -3 at inertial ranges. The cascade of a new quantity is proposed to explain these non-conventional slopes. One of our main results is the discovery of material exchange between the central vortex and satellite vortices through 3D pathways, called funnels. These funnels modify the concept of elliptic regions that can trap material when confined to 2D dynamics. Thus, we show that a family of vortices, created by the hydrodynamic instabilities of the initially unstable vortex, can still continue to operate in unity in order to complete the 3D transport in these systems. We also show that flow instabilities can double the magnitude of vertical velocity, increase the rate of vertical exchange by an order of magnitude and enhance mixing rate more than 100%.",

            "abstract": "The increasingly recognized importance of the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) in the global and Arctic climate systems necessitates study of the complex processes at work in the interactions between ice floes, the ocean, and the atmosphere. This study uses observations of surface currents and floe drift speeds to explore the hydrodynamic processes driven by interactions with surface winds surrounding isolated small floes in the Arctic summertime MIZ. The 2013 MIZOPEX campaign flew several unmanned aircraft over the MIZ north of Oliktok Point, AK. These flights had two primary missions: dropping microbuoys into areas of open water between ice floes, and imaging in both thermal and visible using airborne systems. The Air-Deployed Micro Buoys (ADMB) drifted with surface currents, providing a measure of current speeds from the GPS track. ADMB were equipped with a string of thermistors extending two meters below the surface, which measured near-surface temperature gradients. Analysis of visible aerial imagery of ice floes is used to retrieve floe drift speeds from sequential photos by using aircraft telemetry to geolocate the images. Wind speeds from NCEP reanalysis and nearby met data are compared to surface currents and floe drift speeds; surface currents are approximately 4% of wind speeds, which agree well with lab measurements. Thermal imagery from the campaign show cold wakes at the surface near ice floes in certain wind conditions. The spatial view provided by airborne measurements, when combined with subsurface temperature gradients and the relation between drift and current speeds to local wind forcing, paints a picture of the physical interaction between an isolated ice floe in the MIZ and the open water surrounding it.",

            "abstract": "Devastating floods in mountain regions of the western US and Canada can result from rapid snowmelt during mid-winter rain-on-snow (ROS) events. Key components of snowmelt flooding during ROS are conditions prior to the storm, the combination of temperature, humidity and wind during the event, and the extent to which the snowcover is exposed to the wind. The critical antecedent condition is extension of the snowcover to lower elevations spanning the rain/snow transition zone. In the mountain basins this significantly increases the snow-covered area (SCA) and the volume of water stored in the snowcover. During ROS events the elevation of the rain/snow transition can rise, resulting in rain to occur over large areas. During typical conditions the mountain snowcover is generally cooled by evaporation (latent heat flux) and warmed by sensible heat flux, such that turbulent fluxes have little effect on the energy state of the snowcover. However, during ROS condensation occurs on the snow increasing melt energy by 50 – 100 times such that most of the energy for snowmelt comes from the combination of sensible and latent heat exchange. If the SCA is extensive and exposed to the wind, the surface water input (SWI) may be more than doubled by the addition of snowmelt to the rain. Data indicate that as the climate warms, higher temperatures and more humid conditions during storms may result in more frequent flooding events from mountain regions.",

Our analysis is based on the assumption that total deformation is the simple sum of elastic and viscous (or power-law creep) deformations (i.e., akin to a Maxwell model having a spring and dashpot in series). The key simplification in our analysis is the assumption that strain and its time derivative vary linearly as a function of depth through the thin ice shelf, and are zero at the neutral plane half the distance between the surface and base. We develop an analytic solution for idealized geometry and loading functions, and compare to a hierarchy of numerical treatments, including comparisons with full-Stokes solutions of viscoelastic flexure using an advanced finite-element package. Our work is applicable to numerous problems in ice-shelf and ice-tongue glaciology where impulsive loads or impulsive changes in geometry are involved. Examples of application include hydrostatic rebound in the aftermath of sudden surface lake drainage on Larsen B Ice Shelf immediately prior to its disintegration, ice-shelf and iceberg margin response to sudden edge-on-edge collisions between the two (push-mound formation), impulsive changes to geometry associated with ice-shelf calving, ice-front geometry modification by melting, necking phenomena, and basal crevassing.",

Land use change is a critical element of global change that will both drive and respond to climate change.

We synthesize previous studies to estimate that historical land use change has likely led to a global mean aerosol cooling equivalent to 15-35% of the radiative forcing driven by anthropogenic emissions. This cooling is likely to continue through the 21st century, but is subject to large uncertainties associated with future agricultural practices and fire activity.",

            "abstract": "Now in its tenth year, “In the Footsteps of Roger Revelle” (IFRR) is a middle school science education program that draws student interest, scientific content and coherence with Next Generation Science Standards from real-time research at sea in fields of physical science. As a successful collaboration involving Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO),Office of Naval Research (ONR), and San Marcos Middle School (SMMS), IFRR brings physical oceanography and related sciences to students at the San Marcos Middle School in real-time from research vessels at sea using SIO's HiSeasNet satellite communication system. With a generous grant from ONR, students are able to tour the SIO Ships and spend a day at sea doing real oceanographic data collection and labs. Through real-time and near-realtime broadcasts and webcasts, students are able to share data with scientists and gain an appreciation for the value of Biogeochemical research in the field as it relates to their classroom studies. Interaction with scientists and researchers as well as crew members gives students insights into not only possible career paths, but the vital importance of cutting edge oceanographic research on our society.\nWith their science teacher on the ship as an education outreach specialist or ashore guiding students in their interactions with selected scientists at sea, students observe shipboard research being carried out live via videoconference, Skype, daily e-mails, interviews, digital whiteboard sessions, and web interaction. Students then research, design, develop, deploy, and field-test their own data-collecting physical oceanography instruments in their classroom. The online interactive curriculum models the Next Generation Science Standards encouraging active inquiry and critical thinking with intellectually stimulating problem- solving, enabling students to gain critical insight and skill while investigating some of the most provocative questions of our time, and seeing scientists as role-models. IFRR has provided students in the San Diego area with a unique opportunity for learning about oceanographic research, which could inspire students to become oceanographers or at least scientifically literate citizens, a benefit for our society at large.",

            "abstract": "Paleointensity measurements of Archean rocks reveal a strong geodynamo at ~3.45 Ga, while excess nitrogen content of lunar soil samples implies no geodynamo at ~3.9 Ga. Here I propose that initiation of a strong geodynamo is delayed due to accretion style of Earth, involving collision and merging of a few dozen Moon to Mars size planetary embryos. Two accretion scenarios consisting of 25 and 50 embryos are investigated. The collision of an embryo heats the proto-Earth’s core differentially and the rotating low-viscosity core stably stratifies, creating a spherically symmetric and radially increasing temperature distribution. Convection starts in the outer core after each impact but is destroyed by the next impact. The iron core of an impacting embryo descends in the mantle and merges to the proto-Earth’s core. Both adiabatic and non-adiabatic merging cases are studied. A major part of the gravitational energy released due to core merging is used to lift up the upper portion of the core to emplace the impactor core material at the neutrally buoyant level in the proto-Earth’s core. The remaining energy is converted to heat. In the adiabatic case the merging embryo’s core retains all of the remaining energy, while in the non-adiabatic merging 50% of the remaining energy is shared with the outer part of the proto-Earth’s core where the embryo’s core descends. The two merging models result in significantly different temperature distributions in the core at the end of accretion. After the accretion, the convecting shell in the outer core grows monotonically and generates geodynamo gradually. It takes about 50-100 Myr for the convecting shell to generate a strong dipole field at the surface, 50,000 to 100,000 nT, in the presence of a large stably stratified liquid inner core when the convecting outer core thickness exceeds about one half the radius of the Earth’s core.",

            "abstract": "Microzonation, i.e. the estimation of (shear) wave velocity profiles of the upper few 100m in dense 2D surface grids is one of the key methods to understand the variation in seismic hazard caused by ground shaking events. In this presentation we introduce a novel method for estimating the Love-wave phase velocity dispersion by using ambient noise recordings. We use the vertical component of rotational motions inherently present in ambient noise and the well established relation to simultaneous recordings of transverse acceleration. In this relation the frequency dependent phase velocity of a plane SH (or Love)-type wave acts as a proportionality factor between the anti-correlated amplitudes of both measures. In a first step we used synthetic data sets with increasing complexity to evaluate the proposed technique and the developed algorithm to extract the direction and amplitude of the incoming ambient noise wavefield measured at a single site. Since reliable weak rotational motion sensors are not yet readily available, we apply array derived rotation measurements in order to test our method. We next use the technique to analyze different real data sets of ambient noise measurements as well as seismic recordings at active volcanoes and compare these results with findings of the Spatial AutoCorrelation technique which was applied to the same data set. We demonstrate that the newly developed technique shows comparable results to more classical, strictly array based methods. Furthermore, we show that as soon as portable weak motion rotational motion sensors are available, a single 6C-station approach will be feasible, not only for microzonation but also for general array applications, with performance comparable to more classical techniques. An important advantage, especially in urban environments, is that with this approach, the number of seismic stations needed is drastically reduced.",

            "abstract": "Reactive transport use to be a complicated problem by the difficulty of finding a universal numerical method, which reproduces the natural behaviour. Eulerian methods provide accurate results, since they give second order convergence, but they require meeting stability conditions that restrict their actual applicability. Eulerian - Lagrangian methods overcome these limitations, but often cause additional mixing by numerical dispersion. This is a particularly serious problem when transport is coupled to fast chemical reactions, whose rate is controlled by mixing.\nThis work proposes an Eulerian-Lagrangià method without numerical dispersion for solving reactive transport based on mixing. The method consists on the construction of a streamline oriented grid such that the transit time between sequential cells remains constant (isochronal mesh). We have tested the method performances in two different cases: 1) Instantaneous point injection with analytical solution and 2) considering an isolated fracture. In both we have compared the proposed method against existing Eulerian and Eulerian-Lagrangian methods. The results confirm that the proposed method is superior to the two existing cases where dispersivities are medium and low, although the method needs additional refinements in mediums with great heterogeneous. In addition, a new reactive transport method has been obtained.",

            "abstract": "A number of studies have recently documented that pyrogenic carbon (PyC) is an integral and significant proportion of DOM in worldwide rivers, and that this material originates from all fractions of the PyC continuum, from highly resistant PyC to more soluble, labile components. Understanding the transfer of PyC to river systems is paramount for Arctic regions, given the projected increase in frequency and intensity of forest fires in boreal ecosystems. Considering this potential increase in the production of boreal PyC, constraining the PyC-cycle in Arctic environments is essential. However, one of the parameters that affect the fate of PyC in river systems, the environmental partitioning between soluble and particulate phases (Kd), has so far been unstudied. This is particularly important to quantify for low-temperature PyC, due to the greater experimental solubility of this portion of the PyC continuum. Here, we present for the first time a study that analyzes phase partitioning of low-temperature PyC biomarkers in two Arctic Rivers: a small Canadian river, the Great Whale River in northern Quebec, and the largest Arctic River, the Yenisei River in north-central Siberia. During the spring freshet increases in discharge in each river, mass-normalized sorption coefficients (Kd) increase by two orders of magnitude, whereas organic carbon-normalized sorption coefficients (KOC) vary by a much smaller range. The former trend implies that spring discharge events export potentially fresher materials in the sorbed fractions, as the PyC components may not yet have fully equilibrated with the aqueous phase. The latter observation suggests an association of combustion biomarkers with particulate organic matter (char particles or sorbed soil organic matter). The present work confirms that low temperature PyC biomarkers sorb to particles at a high enough level to enter sedimentary deposits and record wildfire signatures. However, the Kd-KOC values for these rivers are 3-4 orders of magnitude lower than those reported for organic markers of high-temperature combustion (e.g. hydrophobic pyrogenic PAHs), suggesting a high potential for exchange with the aqueous phase and thus accessibility to microbial degradation.",

            "abstract": "Chromium isotope systematics in marine sediments are now being used as a new redox proxy of the modern and ancient Earth’s surface. Chromium is primarily delivered to the oceans by riverine inputs through weathering of Cr(III)-rich minerals present in the continental crust and oxidation of insoluble Cr(III) to soluble Cr(VI) species. Since oxidation-reduction reactions fractionate Cr isotopes whereby oxidized Cr(VI) species are preferentially enriched in heavy Cr isotopes, the Cr isotope composition of marine sediments may be useful tracers of redox conditions at the Earth’s surface through geological time. Chromium is quantitatively removed in organic-rich sediments where reducing conditions prevail and promote reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III), and thus, these sediments should capture the ambient seawater Cr isotope composition. However, the isotopic composition of modern organic-rich sediments is poorly documented so far, and this step is essential for further modeling the global oceanic Cr isotope mass balance and assessing the effects of sedimentation and post-depositional processes on the marine Cr isotopes archive.\nIn this study, we have characterized modern marine organic-rich sediments for their Cr isotope composition (δ53/52Cr) from two different settings, the Peru margin upwelling zone and the anoxic Cariaco Basin (Venezuela). Chromium isotopes were measured on a MC-ICP-MS (Nu Plasma) using a double-spike correction method. The authigenic fraction of shallow samples from the Peru margin sedimentary sequence with a high Total Organic Carbon (TOC) content (>10 wt%) yield an average δ53/52Crauthigenic value of +0.67 ±0.05 ‰ (2sd). However, although this value is close to the seawater value (Atlantic Ocean) and to Cariaco basin sediments (~ +0.6 ‰), reducing sediments from the Peru margin are on average isotopically slightly heavier, especially in samples having a low authigenic fraction and a low TOC content (δ53/52Crauthigenic values up to +1.30 ‰). Results suggest either a different Cr isotope composition for Pacific seawater or the effects of Cr removal processes in anoxic basins and reducing sediments from upwelling zones.",

            "abstract": "In this paper we present the major geomorphological features of comet Churymov-Gerasimenko (C-G), with emphasis on those that may have formed through collisional processes. The C-G nucleus has been imaged with the Rosetta/OSIRIS camera system at varying spatial resolution. At the moment of this writing the maximum spatial resolution achieved is ~20 meter per pixel, and it will improve to reach the unprecedented centimeter-scale in November 2014. This resolution should allow us to identify and characterize pits, lineaments and blocks that could be the result of collisional evolution. Indeed, C-G has spent some 1000 years on orbits crossing the main asteroid belt, and a much longer time in the outer solar system. Collisions may have, therefore, shaped the morphology of the nucleus in various ways. Previously imaged Jupiter Family Comets (e.g., Tempel 1) show significant numbers of pits and lineaments, some of which could be due to collisions. Additional proposed formation mechanisms are related to cometary activity processes, such as volatile outgassing.\nIn addition to small scale features, the overall shape of C-G could also provide insights into the role of collisional processes. A striking feature is that C-G's shape is that of a contact binary. Similar shapes have been observed on rocky asteroids (e.g., Itokawa) and are generally interpreted as an indication of their rubble pile nature. A possibility is that C-G underwent similar processes, and therefore it may be constituted by reaccumulated fragments ejected from a larger precursor. An alternative view is that the current shape is the result of inhomogeneous outgassing activity, which may have dug a ~1-km deep trench responsible for the apparent contact binary shape.\nThe role of the various proposed formation mechanisms (collisional vs outgassing) for both small scale and global features will be investigated and their implications for the evolution of C-G will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Obtaining reliable estimates of the absolute palaeointensity of the Earth’s magnetic field is notoriously difficult. Many methods to obtain paleointensities from suitable records such as lavas and archeological artifacts involve heating the samples. These heating steps are believed to induce ‘magnetic alteration’ – a process that is still poorly understood but prevents obtaining correct paleointensity estimates. To observe this magnetic alteration directly we imaged the magnetic domain state of titanomagnetite particles – a common carrier of the magnetic remanence in samples used for paleointensity studies. We selected samples from the 1971-flow of Mt. Etna from a site that systematically yields underestimates of the known intensity of the paleofield - in spite of rigorous testing by various groups.\nMagnetic Force Microscope images were taken before and after a heating step typically used in absolute palaeointensity experiments. Before heating, the samples feature distinct, blocky domains that sometimes seem to resemble a classical magnetite domain structure. After imparting a partial thermo-remanent magnetization at a temperature often critical to paleointensity experiments (250 °C) the domain state of the same titanomagnetite grains changes into curvier, wavy domains. Furthermore, these structures appeared to be unstable over time: after one-year storage in a magnetic field-free environment the domain states evolved into a viscous remanent magnetization state.\nOur observations may qualitatively explain reported underestimates from technically successful paleointensity experiments for this site and other sites reported previously. Furthermore the occurrence of intriguing observations such as ‘the drawer storage effect’ by Shaar et al (EPSL, 2011), and viscous magnetizations observed by Muxworthy and Williams (JGR, 2006) may be (partially) explained by our observations. The major implications of our study for all palaeointensity methods involving heating may be evident.",

Deep within the caves and beyond where vegetative detritus from the entrance pool (or cenote) is present, a surprising diversity of higher-order animals (mostly crustaceans) is found. How these ecosystems thrive in an environment where no obvious sources of food are visible is enigmatic. A decades-old study based on the simple observation of 13C-depleted biomass in the stygobitic (cave-adapted) fauna suggested biogeochemical processes related to methane-linked carbon cycling and/or other chemoautotrophic pathways as a source of energy and carbon, but was unable to identify the exact source of this material. In this study, we investigate the biogeochemistry of four anchialine caves along an 8 km transect running perpendicular to the coastline. We measured the distribution, concentration and isotopic composition of biotic and abiotic components of the ecosystem to identify the energetic sources and microbial processes that sustain life in this subsurface aquifer. High concentrations of methane (5 µM) and evidence for methane oxidation in the fresh water portion of the water column suggest methane availability and consumption. Furthermore, the presence of 13C-depleted fatty acids (e.g., C16:1ω7c with δ13C-values as low as -54.1‰) and deuterium-depleted δD values (e.g., as low as δD = -225‰) from tissues of an atyid shrimp provide evidence that methanotrophic bacteria were a substantial fraction of its diet. Molecular microbial community analyses of shrimp guts and the water column are underway to identify the methanotrophs. These findings have the potential to reframe the carbon cycle and ecosystem dynamics for an isolated, yet widespread habitat within the Earth’s interior.",

Having relied on ACE to provide critical warnings of geomagnetic storms since 1998, it is important for the space weather community to understand how DSCOVR will perform relative to ACE in real-time operations. The WIND/SWE instrument is sufficiently similar to the DSCOVR Faraday Cup that it can be used as a proxy for DSCOVR, with some caveats. We compare the ACE/SWEPAM and WIND/SWE observations for all geomagnetic storm events meeting the criteria of severe or extreme. We also examine time periods where ACE data were compromised by solar energetic particles. We find that DSCOVR will provide a more robust data stream than was provided by ACE during solar cycle 23. We will briefly address the magnetometer, supra-thermal particle measurements, and relativistic proton measurements provided by ACE, of which only the magnetometer is retained on DSCOVR. We also demonstrate that lead time for geomagnetic storm notifications to customers far exceeds the L1 to Earth delay time.",

            "abstract": "The nature of reversals of the geomagnetic field and the details of the transition fields remain controversial. However, reversal records from the Agno batholith and Tatoosh intrusion confirm the suggestion of Valet et al., (2012) from studies of lava records, that there is a threefold division in reversal transition directions. In the Agno, the first phase, or precursor, consists of a CCW loop of the VGP moving from high southerly latitude reverse poles to reach North America. The second phase takes the VGP along a half CCW loop from the tip of South America to northern latitudes at the intensity minimum. The third phase, or rebound is a smaller CCW loop and the main intensity recovery begins. The first and third phases appear to be paleosecular variation loops analogous to present London-Paris secular variation loops. The Tatoosh intrusion gives a similar, but less complete record with the VGPs again confined to the East Pacific and the Americas. Away from the reversal region, secular variation loops in the Tatoosh were shown to be comparable in duration to the precursor in the transition record, consistent with the first phase being a paleosecular variation loop in the Agno. Using westward drift estimates from the present field, this should last about1800 years. This gives ~3300 for phase 2, in an intensity low of >16,000 years. A feature of R to N reversal field models is a low latitude magnetic field flux concentration of the same sign as the polar vortex of the south geographic pole. This is followed by northward flux flow, e.g. Shao et al., (1999). The reversal is achieved by northward motion of this flux feature. The feature is locked in longitudinal mantle coordinates and similarly the VGPs in the Agno and Tatoosh records are confined to the longitudes of the eastern Pacific and the Americas. Whether we are approaching a reversal remains to be seen, although judging by these intrusion records the field intensity would need to decrease much further before major directional changes should take place. In the Agno record, these changes start near to the intensity minimum. In the Tatoosh record, the field decreases by an order of magnitude before the major directional changes take place.",

            "abstract": "Air Force Weather (AFW) has documented requirements for real-time cloud analysis to support DoD missions around the world. To meet these needs, AFW utilizes the Cloud Depiction and Forecast System (CDFS) II system to develop an hourly cloud analysis. The system creates cloud masks at pixel level from 16 different satellite sources, diagnoses cloud layers, reconciles the pixel level data to a regular grid by instrument class, and optimally merges the various instrument classes to create a final multi-satellite analysis.\nThe time sensitive nature of some DoD missions requires that an analysis be created as quickly as possible after a given hour. Currently, CDFS II creates an analysis at thirteen minutes after the hour of interest to balance operation needs with available satellite data. While this does produce a skillful analysis, it has been long recognized that much of the satellite data available for a given hour arrives too late to be available for the analysis. Many of the DoD missions do not carry such stringent time requirements and may be able to wait some time if doing so increases the skill of the analysis considerably. Missions of interest include the development of cloud climatologies and statistical post processing of NWP cloud information. In addition, a more complete analysis would provide a better source for validation. To this end, AFW has undertaken to examine the potential value of a cloud re-analysis that would be created some time after the given hour of interest in an effort to maximize the use of available data and minimize the overall global pixel age.\nThis presentation will present the results of efforts to create the cloud re-analysis including the methodology, impact on global pixel age and on the overall cloud characterization.",

            "abstract": "Dam removals featuring unchecked releases of non-cohesive sediments are excellent opportunities to learn more about stream channel response to abrupt increases in bed material supply that can occur deliberately or by natural processes like landslides and volcanic eruptions. Understanding channel response to sediment pulses, including response rates, is essential because human uses of river channels and floodplains are impacted by these events as are aquatic habitats. We had the opportunity to study a dam removal site at the Simkins Dam in Maryland, USA, that shares many important geophysical attributes of another well-studied dam removal in the humid northeast United States [Merrimack Village Dam, New Hampshire; Pearson et al., 2011]. The watershed sizes are the same order of magnitude (102 km2), and at both sites relatively low head dams were removed (~ 3-4 m) and ~60,000 m3 of dominantly sand-sized sediments discharged to low-gradient reaches immediately downstream. Analyzing four years of repeat morphometry and bed sediment grain size surveys at the Simkins site on the Patapsco River, as well as continuous discharge and suspended sediment gaging data, we clearly document a two-phase response in the upstream reach as described by Pearson et al. [2011] for their New Hampshire site and noted at other dam removals [e.g., Major et al., 2012]. In the early phase, approximately 50% of the impounded sediment mass was eroded rapidly over a period of about three months when flows were very modest (Figure 1). After incision to base level and channel widening in the former impoundment, a second phase began when further erosion depended on floods large enough to access impounded sediments more distant from the newly-formed channel. We also found important differences in the upstream responses at the Maryland and New Hampshire sites that appear to be related to valley type (non-glaciated versus glaciated, respectively). Response variances immediately downstream between the respective sites are potentially related to local gradient and hydraulics.",

            "abstract": "The efficiency of the biological pump (EBP) in the Southern Ocean (i.e. the completeness of nutrient consumption in its surface waters) is a critical modulator of the atmospheric CO2 concentration (pCO2), but how it has varied in the past is uncertain. The nitrogen isotopic composition (d15N) of organic matter is a promising tool in reconstructing EBP in the past Southern Ocean because phytoplankton preferentially consume 14N-nitrate relative to 15N-nitrate, resulting in a correlation between the d15N of sinking organic matter and the fraction of the nitrate supply consumed in the surface ocean (EBP). Here we present the first set of Southern Ocean d15N records from deep-sea fossil corals, which consume organic matter that derives from the sinking flux. The corals are from the Drake Passage, with collection sites in both the Antarctic and Subantarctic Zones (AZ, SAZ), and the SAZ south of Tasmania. While previous work has shown that the productivity changes from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the Holocene were opposite in the SAZ and AZ (LGM productivity was higher in the SAZ but lower in the AZ), all of our three regions show that the d15N during the LGM/deglaciation are ~4‰ higher than the Holocene, indicating a much more efficient biological pump across the entire glacial Southern Ocean. Greatest inter-coral d15N variability appears to occur during the deglaciation (10-15 ka) than during the Holocene and glacial period, and the data generated so far on intra-coral d15N variation (multiple measurements within individual coral septa) also show a maximum in variability during the deglaciation. This relatively high inter- and intra-coral d15N variability during the deglaciation suggests fluctuations in EBP on annual/decadal timescales. Despite the short-timescale variation, the coral data in hand suggest that the overall deglacial decrease in d15N began at ~15 ka, later than expected if the data recorded a whole-Southern Ocean EBP decline that led to the first rise in atmospheric pCO2.

            "abstract": "Spurious diapycnal mixing (κd) is often induced in the z-coordinate ocean model, which may be comparable in magnitude to the physical mixing. In order to investigate how the simulated climate may be affected by such spurious mixing, we use a fully coupled climate model, CM2G, in which the ocean module employs a density-coordinate in the vertical direction. The effect of spurious mixing in this model is much smaller than most z-coordinate models, allowing for a reliable specification of the values for κd. In a series of sensitivity tests, we increase κd by 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 (unit: 10-5 m2 s-1), respectively, relative to the default value. In the first set of experiments, we run the model to equilibrium for each of the six κd (including the default value) under pre-industrial conditions, and investigate how the variability of Atlantic Meridional Ocean Circulation (AMOC) changes with κd. For the run with default κd, there is a sharp peak between period 20 to 30 years in the spectrum of AMOC variability. When κd is increased, we find that this peak generally becomes lower and lower, from ~45 Sv2/Hz when κd has the default value to only ~15 Sv2/Hz when κdis increased by 8 units.\n In the second set of experiments, we apply freshwater forcing (0.1 Sv) over the North Atlantic (50°N - 70°N) to each of the six runs obtained in the first set, and study how AMOC responds to the forcing. We find that the response of AMOC to freshwater forcing is significantly different for different κd. It weakens less and the response time becomes shorter when κd is increased. For example, AMOC weakens from ~24 Sv to ~18 Sv for the default κd, but weakens from ~35 Sv to ~32 Sv when κd is increased by 8 units. Our study therefore demonstrates that the AMOC stability and variability are strongly dependent on the value of κd, reducing the spurious component of this parameter in climate models is critical for simulating realistic climate variability, either internally or externally forced.",

We tested bulk samples of Ca(ClO4)2 using Raman spectroscopy to observe spectral changes in the perchlorate band (930-990 cm-1) and the O-H vibrational stretching band (3000-3700 cm-1) of the samples. Our results indicate that brine formation by deliquescence (absorption of water vapor from the atmosphere) does not occur at Gale Crater within the time (< 2 hours) [2] when the ground temperature is above the calcium perchlorate’s eutectic temperature (199 K) [3] and the relative humidity is above the deliquescence threshold (26%) [4]. On the contrary, we show that bulk liquid brine of calcium perchlorate salt forms within minutes if the salt is in direct contact with water ice. However, water ice is not expected in the shallow (tens of cm) subsurface of Gale Crater [5] and, on the sols during which frost events might have occurred at the surface, the calculated frost point (~190 K) [2] was below the eutectic temperature of the perchlorate.\nLiquid water is one of the necessary ingredients for the development of life as we know it. The behavior of various liquid states of H2O such as liquid brine, undercooled liquid interfacial water, subsurface melt water and ground water [6] needs to be understood in order to address the potential habitability of Mars for microbes and future human exploration. These results are relevant because they help in constraining the possible mechanisms of the formation of liquid water at Gale.\n",

            "abstract": "The impacts of armed conflict on ecosystems are complex and difficult to assess due to restricted access to affected areas making satellite remote sensing a useful tool for studying direct and indirect effects of conflict on the landscape. The Imatong Central Forest Reserve (ICFR) in South Sudan together with the nearby Dongotana Hills and the Agoro-Agu Forest Reserve (AFR) in Northern Uganda share a boundary and encompass a biologically diverse montane ecosystem. This study used satellite data combined with general human population trends to examine the impact of armed conflict and its outcome on similar forest ecosystems both during and after hostilities. A Disturbance Index (DI) was used to investigate the location and extent of forest cover loss and gain in three areas for two key time periods. Results indicate that the rate of forest recovery was significantly higher than the rate of disturbance both during and after wartime in and around the ICFR. In contrast, the nearby Dongotana Hills experienced relatively high rates of disturbance during both periods; however, post war period losses were largely offset by some gains in forest cover. Discussions with local inhabitants confirmed these findings and provided further insights into the underlying causes impacting forest cover and wildlife. South Sudan is the latest nation to join the Global Environment Facility (GEF). While the GEF does not explicitly address conflict, many of the projects it supports occur in conflict and post-conflict zones with wide-ranging repercussions for both people and the environment. In an effort to assess best practices for working in conflict and post-conflict areas, the GEF Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP) will undertake an analysis of GEF-funded projects over the last two decades to identify where the GEF has promoted cooperation between groups and states, and/or made a positive contribution toward conflict avoidance resulting in shared environmental benefits.",

            "abstract": "We analyze the highest confidence measurements of relative humidity [1] and ground temperature [2] to identify potential frost events at the surface of Gale Crater during the first 600 sols of the MSL mission. We find that between 4 and 6 am on sols 533, 535, 555, 557, 559 and 560 the ground temperature falls below the calculated frost point. Order-of-magnitude estimate for the thickness of the frost layer indicates that it is of the order of micrometers or less. Additionally, we analyze the relation between water vapor pressure and ground temperature to provide additional constraints on potential frost events and to quantify the exchange of adsorbed water between the surface and the atmosphere.\nAdsorbed water could be forced into liquid-like state at the of Gale because van der Waals forces between water ice molecules and mineral surfaces reduces the freezing point [3]. This form of liquid water is relevant to habitability because microorganisms could survive in liquid-like adsorbed water [4].\n",

            "abstract": "Observations low in the solar corona are key to understanding the initiation and propagation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Similar to solar magnetographs and total solar irradiance measurements, white-light coronagraph observations are another aspect of Heliophysics that have followed a path comparable to that found in Earth science, where longevity and continuity of measurements lead to new understanding through modeling. Previously we have reported on our efforts to fill the only remaining data gap since 1973 in the CME rate using the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory’s MK3 K-coronameter observations from 1989-1996. The MK3 instrument observed routinely several hours most days beginning in 1980 until it was upgraded to MK4 in 1998. MK3 CMEs detected from 1980-1989 were compared with Solwind and SMM and reported by St. Cyr et al. (1999). Here we provide a preliminary report on the statistical properties of CMEs detected during 1989-1996. Since this period began in solar maximum activity conditions and descended into minimum, we can compare the properties of MLSO MK3 events with CMEs detected by other coronagraphs during similar activity phases.",

Over the past decade, modeling and observational studies have shown that these waves can penetrate to high altitudes and play similar roles in the thermospheric region (~110 – 400 km). Several case studies have revealed their presence in the thermosphere, but the distributions and variability of thermospheric gravity wave parameters are currently unknown. Using methods developed by Nicolls and Heinselman (2007), we present new high-latitude thermospheric wave characteristic distributions obtained using the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR) during a one year period from August 2010 – July 2011. Their winter season distributions (January 2010 – April 2011) are compared to recent results obtained using a co-located all sky airglow imager measuring the MLT gravity wave field.",

            "abstract": "A high quality, long-term, high-resolution precipitation dataset is a key requirement for supporting drought monitoring and long term trend analysis. In this presentation we introduce a new dataset: the Climate Hazards group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS), developed by scientists at the University of California, Santa Barbara and the U.S. Geological Survey Earth Resources Observation and Science Center. This new quasi-global precipitation product is available at daily to seasonal time scales, with a spatial resolution of 0.05°, and a 1981 to near real-time period of record. The three main types of information used in the CHIRPS are: (1) global 0.05° precipitation climatologies, (2) time-varying grids of infrared cold cloud duration (CCD) precipitation estimates, and (3) in situ precipitation observations.\nThe CHG has developed an extensive database of in situ daily, pentadal and monthly precipitation totals with over a billion daily observations worldwide. Most of these observations come from four sets: the monthly Global Historical Climate Network version 2, the daily Global Historical Climate Network, the Global Summary of the Day (GSOD), and the daily Global Telecommunication System (GTS) provided by NOAA's Climate Prediction Center (CPC). A screening procedure was developed to remove suspected “false zeros” from the daily GTS and GSOD data, since these data can artificially suppress rainfall totals.\nWe compare CHIRPS and ARC2, CFS-Reanalysis, CHIRP, CMORPH, CPC-Unified, ECMWF, PERSIANNE, RFE2, TAMSAT, TRMM-RT7, TRMM-V7 to GPCC. The CHIRPS is shown to have high correlation, low systematic errors (bias) and low mean absolute errors. The CHIRPS performance is similar to research quality products like the GPCC and GPCP, but with higher resolution and lower latency. Cross validation results for over 100 countries and comparisons with alternate algorithms will be presented.",

            "abstract": "For many practical problems, non-Fickian transport can be described using a convolution of an input function and the underlying travel time distribution (TTD) between two points. In some cases, the TTD for dissolved solutes can also be expressed in terms of the groundwater age distribution and it has been shown that highly accurate estimates of transport behavior can be found when the required age distributions are known. However, identifying the TTD typically requires a field tracer test or numerical modeling, both of which may be difficult to implement realistically and both may contain significant uncertainty or error. Considering these limitations, it has yet to be shown how accurate transfer function based models that use an estimated TTD will be given an inexact approximation of the age distribution, that is one derived directly from measured concentrations of environmental tracers. This work considers the accuracy of the transfer function approach for simulating non-Fickian transport using several different approaches for constraining the age distributions. Fickian and non-Fickian models for age are estimated from simulated tracer data using simple 1-D models and streamtube ensembles. The errors in the estimated TTD propagate into the transport simulations and significant alterations in shape of the breakthrough curve can result. Despite these errors, the estimated transport behaviors are often very reasonable approximations of the known solutions, particularly in light of the limited data used to generate the estimates.",

            "abstract": "A meta-analysis of data from our laboratory combined with previously published studies on the effects of ocean acidification on rotalid and miliolid large benthic Foraminifera (LBF) was conducted. This meta-analysis, which included 11 LBF species, found divergent growth rates between the two orders. At [CO2(air))] < 600 ppm, rotalids increased their diameters by 0.6 ± 0.3(SE)%/d and miliolids increased their diameters by 1.0 ± 0.5%/d. At [CO2(air))] between 600 – 1,050 ppm, rotalids and miliolid diameters increased by 0.6 ± 0.5%/d and 0.9 ± 0.7%/d, respectively. At [CO2(air))] > 1,050 ppm rotalids and miliolid increased their diameters by 0.3 ± 0.4%/d and 0.5±0.4%/d, respectively. Using these growth rate values, we estimated LBF carbonate sediment production on the west Florida shelf, an area covering 54,000 km2 to a depth of 30 m, at 3.4 Mt/yr. Additionally, a model incorporating foraminiferal growth rates, seawater chemistry, and WFS habitat distributions projects a 1.5 Mt/yr to 1.1 Mt/yr (25%) decrease of rotalid-derived annual carbonate sediment production by the year 2100 ([CO2(air))] ~ 800 ppm), and a 1.5 Mt/yr to 0.7 Mt/yr (55%) decrease by the year 2140 ([CO2(air))] ~ 1,300 ppm). Using this same model, miliolid-derived annual carbonate sediment production is projected to decrease from 1.8 Mt/yr to 1.2 Mt/yr (35%) by 2100 ([CO2(air))] ~ 800 ppm), and from 1.8 Mt/yr to 0.5 Mt/yr (70%) by 2140 ([CO2(air))] ~ 1,300 ppm). These reductions correspond to a net 30% annual reduction of LBF-derived carbonate sediments by 2100 ([CO2(air))] ~ 800 ppm) and 65% by 2140 ([CO2(air))] ~ 1,300 ppm). The differential effects of ocean acidification on the reduction of LBF growth rates and the accompanying transition of LBF-derived carbonate sediment production from predominantly variable-Mg miliolids to low-Mg rotalids will likely have local ecologic implications.",

            "abstract": "Large amplitude (1-40 mV/m) whistler mode waves observed in the solar wind were first reported by Breneman et al. [2010]. The whistler waves were found near stream interaction regions (SIRs) and co-rotating interaction regions (CIRs), and appeared as narrowband waveforms in the frequency range 10-100 Hz (~0.1-0.5 fce). These observations were made possible by the presence of a high time resolution electric field waveform receiver provided by the Time Domain Sampler (TDS) instrument on the STEREO spacecraft. Six months of TDS waveform captures of 2s duration near predicted SIRs and CIRs allowed the first investigation of the characteristics of the whistler waves, such as wave packet duration, amplitude and structure.\nThe THEMIS mission included five spacecraft, each equipped with a full complement of particle and field detectors, including full waveform electric (EFI) and magnetic (SCM) field detectors and electrostatic analyzers (ESA) for thermal charged particles. Two of the spacecraft were successfully transitioned into lunar orbit in 2010, placing them periodically into the solar wind stream interaction region, and these two spacecraft (now called ARTEMIS) thus have extended the THEMIS mission and offer an excellent opportunity to expand on the study of whistler mode waves in this region. We will present observations of coherent large amplitude waves from both STEREO and THEMIS, along with the particles present at the time of these observations. We will carry out statistical studies of the wave packet amplitude, duration, and structure, and the particle distribution characteristics. We will discuss the characteristics of the waves and their role in driving modifications in solar wind electron distributions. Additionally, we will use the WHAMP code to investigate wave growth, given input particle distributions similar to those observed coincident with the whistlers, to see if there is some free energy source in the particles in this region that could be responsible for the generation of these waves.",

            "abstract": "Recovered plate boundary thrust material from the site of the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake rupture contains both distributed and localized fabrics. We1 infer these reflect two end members of behavior, namely steady state creep of weak, velocity/strain-hardening materials versus episodic, seismic failure of strong, velocity/strain-weakening materials. Core and downhole observations and mechanical tests demonstrate the fault rock is primarily smectite and has very low frictional strength (μk~0.08) 2,3,4,5.\nAdditional observations of the recovered core indicate microscale fabrics affect mechanical properties. The fault zone fabric is defined mostly by anastomosing dark surfaces surrounding phacoids. Phacoid size and intensity of dark surfaces vary, probably reflecting differences in total strain. Phacoids contain foliations at angles to their long axes and bounding surfaces. Remnant bedding can be recognized in places, based on variation in phyllosilicate colour or clastic:phyllosilicate ratio (although other colour variations result from alteration1). Anastomosing shear surfaces may coincide with bedding but also commonly truncate it, indicating little primary lithological/rheological control on fabric formation. However, in late mm-thickness, through going, more intensely sheared zones, lithologic contrast more strongly defines phacoids while dark seams may be absent.\nA transition from distributed shear in phyllosilicates to localized shear on dark surfaces requires local change in stress or strain rate. If the orientation of clay fabrics change due to folding (‘turbulent’ flow), then weak basal planes of phyllosilicates rotated into unfavourable orientations may act as ‘stress risers’ promoting localization around phacoids containing poorly oriented fabrics. This mechanism is indicated by the presence of the most folded layering in plate boundary core adjacent to the most distinct through-going surfaces1,2. Alternatively, locally well-oriented fabrics may preferentially shear, leaving surrounding rock as lower strain phacoids.\nRefs: 1: Kirkpatrick, et al. submitted. Tectonics. 2: Chester et al., 2013.

            "abstract": "Over the past decade, the large-scale production of natural gas, and more recently oil, from U.S. shale formations has had a transformative impact on the energy industry. The emergence of shale oil and gas as recoverable resources has altered perceptions regarding both the future abundance and cost of hydrocarbons, and has shifted the balance of global energy geopolitics. However, despite the excitement, shale is a resource in its nascency, and many challenges surrounding its exploitation remain. One of the most significant of these is the dramatic variation in resource productivity across multiple length scales, which is a feature of all of today’s shale plays. This paper will describe the results of work that has looked to characterize the spatial and temporal variations in the productivity of the contemporary shale resource. Analysis will be presented that shows there is a strong stochastic element to observed shale well productivity in all the major plays. It will be shown that the nature of this stochasticity is consistent regardless of specific play being considered. A characterization of this stochasticity will be proposed. As a parallel to the discussion of productivity, the paper will also address the issue of \"learning\" in shale development. It will be shown that “creaming” trends are observable and that although \"absolute\" well productivity levels have increased, \"specific\" productivity levels (i.e. considering well and stimulation size) have actually falling markedly in many plays. The paper will also show that among individual operators' well ensembles, normalized well-to-well performance distributions are almost identical, and have remained consistent year-to-year. This result suggests little if any systematic learning regarding the effective management of well-to-well performance variability has taken place. The paper will conclude with an articulation of how the productivity characteristics of the shale resource are impacting on the resources’ economic profile, and the implications of this in terms of the commercial risks associated with shale production activities.",

Presented here are measurements made by FIRST during two successful deployments in a ground-based configuration to measure downwelling longwave radiation at Earth’s surface. The initial deployment was to Cerro Toco, Chile, where FIRST operated from August to October, 2009 as part of the Radiative Heating in Underexplored Bands Campaign (RHUBC-II) campaign. After recalibration, FIRST was deployed to the Table Mountain Facility from September through October, 2012. Spectra observed at each location are substantially different, due in large part to the order of magnitude difference in integrated precipitable water vapor (0.3 cm at Table Mountain, 0.03 cm at Cerro Toco). Dry days for both campaigns are chosen for analysis – 09/24/2009 and 10/19/2012. Also available during both deployments are coincident radiosonde temperature and water vapor vertical profiles which are used as inputs a line-by-line radiative transfer program. Comparisons between measured and modeled spectra are presented over the 200 to 800 cm-1 range. An extensive error analysis of both the measured and modeled spectra is presented. In general, the differences between the measured and modeled spectra are within their combined uncertainties.",

The models consist of multiple linear regressions calibrated using new data from H2O-undersaturated primitive and depleted mantle lherzolite melting experiments as well as experimental literature data. The models investigate the roles of H2O, Pressure, 1-Mg# (1-[XMg/(XMg+XFe)]), NaK# ((Na2O+K2O)/(Na2O+K2O+CaO)), TiO2, and Cr2O3 on mantle melt compositions. Melts are represented by the pseudoternary endmembers Clinopyroxene (Cpx), Olivine (Ol), Plagioclase (Plag), and Quartz (Qz) of Tormey et al. (1987). Model A returns predictive equations for the four endmembers with identical predictor variables, whereas Model B chooses predictor variables for the four compositional endmember equations and temperature independently. We employ the use of Akaike Information Criteria (Akaike, 1974) to determine the best predictor variables from initial variables chosen through thermodynamic reasoning and by previous models.\nIn both Models A and B, the coefficients for H2O show that increasing H2O drives the melt to more Qz normative space, as the Qz component increases by +0.012(3) per 1 wt.% H2O. The other endmember components decrease and are all three times less affected by H2O (Ol: -0.004(2); Cpx: -0.004(2); Plag: -0.004(3)). Consistent with previous models and experimental data, increasing pressure moves melt compositions to more Ol normative space at the expense of the Qz component. The models presented quantitatively determine the influence of H2O, Pressure, 1-Mg#, NaK#, TiO2, and Cr2O3 on mantle melts in equilibrium with ol+opx±sp; the equations presented can be used to predict melts of known mantle source compositions saturated in ol+opx±sp.\n",

This results in significantly different peatland vegetation communities across short distances, as well as differences in wetness, temperature and peat substrates. We have been measuring the spatially integrated CO2, heat and water vapour fluxes from this peatland complex using eddy covariance and the CO2 exchange from specific plant communities within the EC tower footprint since spring 2008. With this data we are examining if it is possible to derive the spatially integrated ecosystem-wide fluxes from community-level simple light use efficiency (LUE) and ecosystem respiration (ER) models. These models have been developed using several years of continuous autochamber flux measurements for the three major plant functional types (PFTs) as well as knowledge of the spatial variability of the vegetation, water table and active layer depths.\nLIDAR was used to produce a 1 m resolution digital evaluation model of the complex and the spatial distribution of PFTs was obtained from concurrent high-resolution digital colour air photography trained from vegetation surveys. Continuous water table depths have been measured for four years at over 40 locations in the complex, and peat temperatures and active layer depths are surveyed every 10 days at more than 100 locations. The EC footprint is calculated for every half-hour and the PFT based models are run with the corresponding environmental variables weighted for the PFTs within the EC footprint. Our results show that the Sphagnum, palsa, and sedge PFTs have distinctly different LUE models, and that the tower fluxes are dominated by a blend of the Sphagnum and palsa PFTs. We also see a distinctly different energy partitioning between the fetches containing intact palsa and those with thawed palsa: the evaporative efficiency is higher and the Bowen ration lower for the thawed palsa fetches.",

            "abstract": "Previous work has shown inter-seasonal variations of the apparent thermal inertia at virtually all Martian latitudes. Because thermal inertia is mainly controlled by low variability parameters (e.g., grain sizes, degree of induration, rock abundance), these variations are usually interpreted in terms of subsurface layering and atmospheric contributions.\nUsing atmospherically corrected surface temperatures at 32 μm wavelength (channel B1) from the Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) onboard Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, we analyze the inter-seasonal variations of the apparent thermal inertia. We show that most of the previously observed inertia variations are eliminated, indicating that a simple homogeneous regolith structure is sufficient to explain most of the measurements. Also, as expected, a fraction of the observed variations remain, especially at high latitudes. This is consistent with subsurface layering involving water ice below dry regolith inferred from other measurement techniques and modeling.\nThis work strengthens our ability to identify and characterize surface/subsurface material thermal inertias, layering and physical heterogeneities in the Martian surface layer, and will help eliminate seasonal striping on high-resolution inertia maps. In addition to a global scale analysis, we will discuss observations in western Elysium Planitia where the Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) lander is planned to land in September 2016. We will provide predictions of the surface layer thermophysical properties, which are required for safe landing and successful scientific operations on the ground.",

            "abstract": "A wide variety of critical information regarding bioclimate, biodiversity, and biogeochemistry is embedded in airborne hyperspectral imagery. Most, if not all of the primary signal relies upon first deriving the surface reflectance of land cover and vegetation from measured hyperspectral radiance. This places stringent requirements on terrain, and atmospheric compensation algorithms to accurately derive surface reflectance properties. An observatory designed to measure bioclimate, biodiversity, and biogeochemistry variables from surface reflectance must take great care in developing an approach which chooses algorithms with the highest accuracy, along with providing those algorithms with data necessary to describe the physical mechanisms that affect the measured at sensor radiance. The Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) part of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is developing such an approach. NEON is a continental-scale ecological observation platform designed to collect and disseminate data to enable the understanding and forecasting of the impacts of climate change, land use change, and invasive species on ecology.\nThe instrumentation package used by the AOP includes a visible and shortwave infrared hyperspectral imager, waveform LiDAR, and high resolution (RGB) digital camera. In addition to airborne measurements, ground-based CIMEL sun photometers will be used to help characterize atmospheric aerosol loading, and ground validation measurements with field spectrometers will be made at select NEON sites. While the core instrumentation package provides critical information to derive surface reflectance of land surfaces and vegetation, the addition of a Solar Spectral Irradiance Radiometer (SSIR) is being investigated as an additional source of data to help identify and characterize atmospheric aerosol, and cloud contributions contributions to the radiance measured by the hyperspectral imager. The addition of the SSIR provides the opportunity to conduct synergistic research which helps to improve ecological data products, while simultaneously measuring radiative properties key to understanding climate. We will present measurements from flights conducted with an SSIR, and explore methods to improve atmospheric compensation of the hyperspectral imagery.",

New additions to the dataset include measurements of the local environmental characteristics in which each convective cloud is embedded. The database is used to enumerate the sensitivity of cloud morphology to the local environment. Herein, the influence of deep-layer vertical shear of the horizontal wind and mid-level vertical velocity will be examined. It is shown that deep-layer shear acts to influence the length scales of convective anvil widths and depths so as to widen and consequently shallow anvils. Anvil base properties are particularly sensitive to shear. Upward mid-level vertical velocity is shown to raise cloud top heights and widen anvils. It also acts to increase the number of convective cores within a cloud system. The relative influences of these quantities are compared to other environmental factors including convective available potential energy, sea-surface temperature, and aerosol concentration. Shear and mid-level vertical velocity are shown to significantly impact ensemble convective morphology. The implications of these trends are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic hazard mitigation at subduction zones critically depends on knowledge of magma generation and ascent processes and timescales. Two diametrically opposite scenarios are presently debated: One paradigm is the generation of low-silica (basaltic) melts in the mantle wedge, followed by protracted sub-liquidus magma ascent and evolution through crystal growth and fractionation in crustal reservoirs, which are tapped during volcanic eruptions. In contrast, a diametrically opposite model favours the generation of higher silica melts in the mantle or in a lower crustal hot zone, followed by rapid decompression to the surface under super-liquidus conditions. In the latter case, crystals are picked up during magma ascent, and are in the process of dissolving. We present multiple lines of evidence that point to crystal uptake as the principal processes by which arc melts acquire their crystal cargo: (i) variable 234U-238U disequilibria in mineral separates; (ii) hydrous mineral rims with amorphous alteration textures; and (iii) two-pyroxene pseudo-decompression paths; cf. Zellmer et al. (2014a,b,c), doi: 10.1144/SP385.3 and 10.1144/SP385.9 and 10.1144/SP410.1. These observations point to a scarcity of true phenocrysts in many arc magmas, and thus to decompression of aphyric melts that take up their crystal cargo during ascent. The data imply that many hydrous wedge melts are more silica-rich than basalts and achieve super-liquidus conditions during rapid ascent from great depth.",

            "abstract": "A Phase-Decomposition-based Persistent Scatterer InSAR (PD-PSInSAR) method is developed in this study to improve the coherence and spatial density of targets. The general idea of conventional PSInSAR is to find and analyze pointwise stable persistent scatterers (PS). In order to improve the PS network density, distributed scatterers (DS) has also been utilized in several advanced PSInSAR techniques. Unlike these techniques which assumes that a DS involves many independent small scatterers sharing the same scatterering mechanism, this study considers additional two general cases: (1) a DS that contains many small scatterers sharing two or more different scatterering mechanisms, (2) two or more dominant scatterers with different scatterering mechanisms that exist within the same resolution pixel.\nDSs with multiple scatterering mechanisms can occur in rural areas and some urban areas, especially with low spatial resolution. Extracting information from DSs with multiple scatterering mechanisms is difficult for the existing DS algorithms because of the interference between different scatterering mechanisms. The new PD-PSInSAR method is developed to overcome this limit by using Eigen-decomposition to estimate the phases corresponding to the different scatterering mechanisms, and then implement these estimated phases in conventional PSInSAR process. Therefore, the interference between different scatterering mechanisms becomes mitigated and the obtained phases are expected to have better coherence.\nThis PD-PSInSAR technique is used to estimate the land deformation over the greater Houston area using 25 ENVISAT ASAR data spanning from July 2004 to June 2010. The deformation map reveals significant subsidence up to approximately 2 cm/year over north and northwestern part of greater Houston. Comparison between the conventional PSInSAR and PD-PSInSAR method verifies that the proposed method can detect more PSs and provide better coherences.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying englacial water or air content, vital for accurate determination of ice viscosity and flow rate, is typically done using EM wave (radar) propagation speed because of its order-of-magnitude variation between ice and inclusions such as air and water. To do so at depth, Cross-Borehole (XBH) radar studies, though spatially limited, are preferred to simpler surface surveys, such as Common-Offset surveys, that rely on prior calculation of shallow ice properties. Even so, velocity measurements need to be both accurate and precise; we show that ±0.004m/ns (~2.5%) velocity error implies an uncertainty of ±0.6% in fractional water content estimate: highly significant, as published water contents of polythermal ice from radar velocities are typically between 0–2%.\nThus, we develop a rigorous approach to quantify potential uncertainties in glacier XBH velocity analysis, their consequences for micro-scale englacial property estimates, and suggest necessary standards for field practice. Major sources of potential uncertainty include first break picking, borehole geometry and most important, instrument drift. This causes up to ±0.003m/ns velocity error for only ±2ns time drift. Use of multi-offset surface calibration shots and measurements of borehole orientation and internal shape are vital. Finally, even an approximate (±4%) air content measurement (necessarily found by another method, such as seismic VSPs) can greatly improve water content calculation accuracy.\nWe apply our approach to XBH data from the ablation area of a polythermal mountain glacier, Storglaciären, Arctic Sweden, where we expect fast surface speeds (>0.168m/ns) due to air content, decreasing with depth due to increasing water content; instead, we find them either near-constant (0.167±0.003m/ns) or increasing with depth to 0.175m/ns, suggesting a strong, masking influence from air. Previous studies of ice properties relied on velocity measurements from a single geophysical survey method. Our study shows the need to combine geophysical survey methods, not just for result validation, but also for accurate quantification of ice properties.",

            "abstract": "We model the interaction of Europa’s tenuous atmosphere with the plasma of Jupiter’s torus with an improved version of our hybrid plasma code. In a hybrid plasma code, the ions are treated as kinetic Macro-particles moving under the Lorentz force and the electrons as a fluid leading to a generalized formulation of Ohm’s law. In this version, the spatial simulation domain is decomposed in 2 directions and is non-uniform in the plasma convection direction. The code is run on a multi-processor supercomputer that offers 16416 cores and 2GB Ram per core. This new version allows us to tap into the large memory of the supercomputer and simulate the full interaction volume (Reuropa=1561km) with a high spatial resolution (50km).\nCompared to Io, Europa’s atmosphere is about 100 times more tenuous, the ambient magnetic field is weaker and the density of incident plasma is lower. Consequently, the electrodynamic interaction is also weaker and substantial fluxes of thermal torus ions might reach and sputter the icy surface.\nMolecular O2 is the dominant atmospheric product of this surface sputtering. Observations of oxygen UV emissions (specifically the ratio of OI 1356A / 1304A emissions) are roughly consistent with an atmosphere that is composed predominantely of O2 with a small amount of atomic O.\nGalileo observations along flybys close to Europa have revealed the existence of induced currents in a conducting ocean under the icy crust. They also showed that, from flyby to flyby, the plasma interaction is very variable. Asymmetries of the plasma density and temperature in the wake of Europa were also observed and still elude a clear explanation. Galileo mag data also detected ion cyclotron waves, which is an indication of heavy ion pickup close to the moon.\nWe prescribe an O2 atmosphere with a vertical density column consistent with UV observations and model the plasma properties along several Galileo flybys of the moon. We compare our results with the magnetometer observations, PLS plasma measurements (ion density, temperature and bulk flow velocity) and PWS electron density measurements.",

            "abstract": "Comparisons are being made between auroral ionospheric E region parameters derived from two types of observations: satellite-based far ultraviolet (FUV) imagers and ground-based ionosondes. The FUV imagers are: 1) NASA's Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics Global Ultraviolet Imager (TIMED/GUVI) and 2) DMSP's Special Sensor Ultraviolet Spectrographic Imager (SSUSI). The ionosondes are five high latitude Digisondes included in the Global Ionospheric Radio Observatory (GIRO) (Reinisch and Galkin, EPS, 2011). The purpose of the comparisons is to determine whether auroral FUV remote sensing algorithms that derive E region parameters from Lyman-Birge-Hopfield (LBH) emissions are biased in the presence of proton aurora. Earlier comparisons between FUV images and in situ auroral particle flux observations (e.g., Knight et al., JGR, 2012) indicate that proton aurora is much more efficient than electron aurora in producing LBH emission, and to be consistent with these findings the FUV-ionosonde comparisons would have to show that auroral FUV-derived NmE (maximum E region electron density) is biased high in the presence of proton precipitation.\nThe advantage of making comparisons with Digisonde observations of the E region (as opposed to incoherent scatter radar) is that Digisondes remain in operation continuously over extended periods of time (i.e. years) and record observations every few minutes, making it possible to gather large numbers of FUV image-coincident observations for statistical studies. The subject of how to interpret auroral E region traces in ionograms has not been studied much up to now, however, and we are making progress in that area. We have found that a modified version of the rules from Piggott and Rawer, U.R.S.I. Handbook of Ionogram Interpretation and Reduction(1972) gives a large number of usable ionograms and good correlation with auroral FUV observations.\nThe figure shows an example of an auroral FUV image with the locations of the ionosonde stations overplotted as blue stars.",

These simulations often use nested grids, which allow detailed simulation of a small subdomain of interest through a series of grid refinements. LES generates errors at grid refinement interfaces, such as resolved energy accumulation, that may compromise solution accuracy. In this talk, I will discuss using the LES turbulence closure to mitigate errors associated with the use of LES on nested grids for a neutral ABL simulation. Specifically, I compare explicit filtering of the advection term and the mixed model to implicit filtering and the eddy viscosity model. Explicitly filtering the advection term allows both mass and momentum to be conserved across grid refinement interfaces. The mixed model reduces unphysical perturbations due to wave reflection. These results demonstrate the strong effect of the turbulence closure on nested grid LES solutions.",

            "abstract": "The Coast Mountains of southeast Alaska are currently experiencing high rates of glacier volume loss. Continued glacier wastage therefore has the potential to decrease the proportion of streamflow derived from glacial runoff, which could alter the nature of dissolved organic matter (DOM) delivered to proglacial streams. We collected snow from ten locations along a transect that extended from the coast 47 km across the Juneau Icefield, southeast Alaska and analyzed the snow for δ18O and DOM for 13C, 14C and fluorescence characteristics. Our goal was to assess the origin and quality of DOM in snow to better understand how continued glacial recession in the region may influence the transfer of organic matter to proglacial aquatic ecosystems. The δ18O of snow decreased with distance from the coast (r2=84, p<0.01) indicative of the natural fractionation or fallout of heavy δ18O that occurs along elevation or spatial gradients. This depletion in the isotopic signature of snow across the Icefield transect was reflected in the origin and quality of DOM. Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) varied from 0.13 to 0.29 mg C L-1 and progressively decreased (r2=43, p<0.05) as δ18O became more depleted. The Δ14C-DOC varied from -742 to -420‰ and showed progressive depletion with decreasing δ18O (r2=56, p<0.01). Older DOC corresponded to a decrease in the percent contribution of humic-like fluorescence (r2=74, p<0.01) suggesting an overall decrease in modern continental DOM across the transect. A three-source isotope mixing model showed that DOM in snow originates mainly from anthropogenic aerosols from fossil fuel combustion (45-74%) and marine sources (17-34%). These results suggest that anthropogenic aerosols are a quantitatively important source of relic DOM to the glacier ecosystem. Given relic DOM exported from glaciers is highly bioavailable, anthropogenic aerosols could profoundly influence the transfer of DOM from glaciers to proglacial aquatic ecosystems.",

However, the region of the interaction of the Saturnian magnetospheric plasma with the Titan atmosphere has been quite devoid of ion cyclotron waves. Finally, on pass T63, ion cyclotron waves were seen briefly. More recently, on pass T98, a longer sequence of ion cyclotron waves also occurred. On pass T63, the pick-up ion signature is that of both H+ and H2+, while on pass T98, only H+ ion cyclotron waves are observed.

            "abstract": "The Santa Barbara Channel (SBC) eddy is a cyclonic mesoscale eddy located off the coast of Southern California, USA. In the summer of 1998 and 1999, the SBC eddy was surveyed for juvenile fishes. In 1998, very high numbers of juvenile fishes were observed within the eddy, but not in 1999. The ocean conditions that contributed to the differences in fish abundances inside the eddy were investigated with three-dimensional numerical modeling. The physical dynamics of the SBC eddy, which included eddy size, three-dimensional rotational structure, and isopycnal uplift, were evaluated using a three-dimensional Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). The retention ability of the eddy was quantified using a three-dimensional particle tracking model driven by the ROMS. The physical dynamics and particle retention of the SBC eddy were found to differ significantly in 1998 and 1999. In 1998, when the SBC eddy was rotating at a steady rate spatially and temporally and cycling consistently in and out of solid-body rotation, the particle retention was high and the isopycnal uplift sustained. However in 1999, when the SBC eddy was rotating unsteadily in space and time and did not have periods of solid-body rotation, the particle retention was low and the isopycnal uplift unstable. We theorize that the steady symmetric rotation of the eddy in 1998 had two important impacts on the biological productivity inside the eddy. First, it provided a prolonged period of cold nutrient rich water uplifting into the euphotic zone, which stimulated productivity and consequently attracted zooplankton. Second, it allowed the zooplankton, prey for the juvenile fish, to be retained inside the eddy, which attracted the juvenile fish. We conclude that biological productivity inside mesoscale eddies may be linked to the stability of its three-dimensional rotational structure and consequently its ability to retain particles.",

            "abstract": "Improving resilience to drought in complex social-environmental systems (SES) is extraordinarily important, particularly for rural tropical locations where small changes in climate regimes can have dramatic SES impacts. Efforts to build drought resilience must necessarily be planned and implemented within SES governance systems that involve linkages in water and land use administration from local to national levels. These efforts require knowledge and understanding that links climate and weather forecasts to regional and local hydrology, to social-economic and environmental systems, and to governance processes. In order to provide structure for such complex choices and investments, we argue that a focus on structured decision processes that involve linkages among science, technological perspectives, and public values conducted with agencies and stakeholders will provide a crucial framework for comparing and building insight for pursuing alternative courses of action to build drought resilience. This paper focuses on a regional case study in the seasonally-dry northwest region of Costa Rica, in watersheds rated as most threatened in the country in terms of drought. We present the overall framework guiding the transdisciplinary efforts to link scientific and technical understanding to public values, in order to foster civil society actions that lead to improved drought resilience. Initial efforts to characterize hydrological and climate regimes will be reported along with our approach to linking natural science findings, social inventories in terms of perspectives on SES, and the psychology and patterns of reliance on forecast information that provide the basis for characterizing public understanding. The overall linkage of technical and value information is focused on creating and comparing alternative actions that can potentially build resilience in short and long time frames by building decision making processes involving stakeholders, agencies and interested parties.",

            "abstract": "This study represents the conclusions of a five-year paleomagnetic study of the Kola Alkaline Province. Most of our work has been concentrated on Devonian magmatic rocks – dykes and intrusive massifs – but at least two dozen Precambrian dykes and, occasionally, host rocks were also sampled. Our paleomagnetic results are based on more than 2000 samples from 130 dolerite and alkaline dykes of Devonian and Precambrian age. Rock magnetic studies were made on tens samples. We also present new geochronological (Ar/Ar) and microprobe data from the Devonian dykes. Moreover, we present new apatite fission track ages, obtained on eleven drill cores from different depths of the Khibina alkaline massif and compare them with our own thermal numerical model in order to estimate the rate and age of the post-magmatic exhumation process. All obtained results will be made available through an open access GIS project from the end of December, 2014 on the site\nhttp://paleomag-ifz.ru/en\n. Analysis of the obtained multidisciplinary data does not fully support the hypothesis of regional Fennoscandia remagnetization event in the Late Jurassic, discussed earlier in (Veselovskiy et al., 2013), and instead leads us to propose the existence of an interval of abnormal behavior of the main geomagnetic field in Devonian time.\nThis study was funded by grants RFBR # 12-05-00216, 13-05-12021, 13-05-12030 and the project of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation (grant no. 14.Z50.31.0017).",

            "abstract": "X-ray powder diffraction experiments have been performed on fifteen fluorapatite-chlorapatite solid solutions synthesized and chemically characterized at the GeoForschungsZentrum - Potsdam (Hovis and Harlov, 2010; Schettler, Gottschalk, and Harlov, 2011), as well as two natural near-end-member samples, from room temperature to ~900 °C at 50 to 75 °C intervals. NIST 640a Si was employed as an internal standard; data from Parrish (1953) were used to determine Si peak positions at elevated temperatures. Unit-cell parameters calculated using the software of Holland and Redfern (1997) result in volume-temperature (V-T) plots that are linear or slightly concave up (V plotted as the vertical axis) over the T range investigated. Relations for the \"a\" and \"c\" unit-cell dimensions with T for these hexagonal minerals are nearly linear but, as with V, commonly improved by quadratic fits to the data. Coefficients of thermal expansion for volume (αV), calculated as (1/V0°C) x (ΔV/ΔT) based on linear V-T relationships, mostly fall within the range 42 ± 2 x 10-6 deg-1 and show no obvious dependence on composition. Thermal expansion coefficients for individual unit-cell axes, however, do show clear relationships to composition, αa increasing from ~9.5 to ~13.5 x 10-6 deg-1 and αc decreasing from ~19.5 to ~13 x 10-6 deg-1 from the Cl to the F end member. Clearly, a compensating structural relationship accounts for the observed relationships. Such compositional dependence was not seen in the thermal expansion data for F-OH apatite solid solutions (Hovis, Scott, Altomare, Leaman, Morris, and Tomaino, American Mineralogist, in press). This difference can be explained by the similar sizes of F- and (OH)‑ versus the much greater size contrast between F‑ and Cl‑.

            "abstract": "Rainfed agriculture continues to be an important part of Ethiopia’s livelihoods and economy. Highly variable inter-annual precipitation, however, presents a serious challenge to sustainable production and subsistence survival. An improved understanding of what drives hydroclimatic extremes and an effective prediction system may help to buffer resulting impacts through improved decision-making. Precipitation data from the National Meteorological Agency at 0.1 x 0.1 grids for 1983 – 2011 during the June-September rainy season over western Ethiopia is evaluated through a cluster analysis to investigate homogeneous regions with similar rainfall patterns for subsequent prediction of seasonal precipitation for each region. A k-means clustering method is applied with the optimal number of clusters (K) selected by the within cluster sum of square errors (WSS) metric. Homogenous regions are defined with relatively clear and smooth boundaries, low inter-cluster correlations, and high intra-cluster correlations. The precipitation prediction models are statistically based, with a seasonal total prediction for each cluster; grid-based predictions are subsequently conditioned on the cluster level prediction through regression. Prospective model predictors include large-scale ocean-land-atmospheric climate variables and local variables and conditions. These predictions will be used in economic and water management models.",

            "abstract": "Newly available sea surface salinity (SSS) data from the Aquarius together with in-situ hydrographic data are used to explore the spatial and temporal characteristics of SSS in the South China Sea (SCS). An evaluation of daily Aquarius data indicates that there exists a negative bias of 0.45 psu for the version 3.0 dataset. The root-mean-square differences (RMSD) for daily Aquarius SSS is about 0.53 after correcting the systematic bias, and those for weekly and monthly Aquarius SSSs are 0.45 and 0.29 psu, respectively. Nevertheless, the Aquarius SSS shows a reliable freshening in 2012, especially in the northern SCS, as the in-situ data does. The northern SCS freshening was around 0.40 psu, which is larger than Aquarius uncertainty indicated by the monthly RMSD. This freshening was caused by a combined effect of local freshwater flux and Kuroshio intrusion. By comparing with 2011, we attribute reduced Kuroshio intrusion as the cause for the freshening over the northern SCS in 2012. In the region near the Mekong River mouth, the river discharge during flood season plays an important role.",

            "abstract": "A measurement of hydraulic head in the aquifer is a critical metric needed for effective water management. Here we report on the use of InSAR data to inform groundwater management in the San Luis Valley (SLV), Colorado. We selected the SLV for study, as it is an important agricultural area struggling with groundwater management after a period of extreme drought. The techniques developed here can also be used to assist groundwater management in other agricultural areas, such as California’s Central Valley.\nReeves at al. (2013) analyzed 30 C-band ERS scenes over the SLV between 1992 and 2000 using the small baseline subset method (SBAS). They concluded that InSAR data can be used to calibrate the subsidence-to-head relationship and temporally extend hydraulic head measurements. To study the extent to which InSAR deformation time series can be used to interpolate spatial gaps in the well-based head measurements, we need to derive an InSAR ground deformation map due to groundwater extraction over the entire SLV. A major error source of InSAR data is highly variable temporal decorrelation over agricultural areas such as the SLV, which limits the number of InSAR pixels that can be selected for the SBAS analysis. Because L-band spaceborne radar systems such as ALOS PALSAR suffer less from temporal decorrelation than C-band and X-band spaceborne radar systems, we processed 92 small baseline interferograms using 17 ALOS scenes acquired between January 2007 and March 2011. We further employed an SBAS ground deformation model to represent surface subsidence due to groundwater extraction, which consists of a seasonal deformation superimposed on a linear trend. We observed that the long-term subsidence rate is smaller than 5 mm/year over the entire SLV and the magnitude of the seasonal subsidence can be up to 2 cm. Our results indicate that there is no severe long-term water storage loss in the confined aquifer at the SLV, consistent with previous C-band InSAR study (Reeves at al., 2013) and well-based hydraulic head data. The next step in our research is to estimate Sk through calibration using co-located InSAR subsidence map and hydraulic head data measured at 36 confined aquifer wells. We can then interpolate the estimates of Sk spatially and reconstruct a hydraulic head map over the entire SLV jointly using InSAR and well data.",

            "abstract": "The great earthquakes and tsunamis of the last decades in Sumatra, Chile, and Japan remind us of the need for expanding the record of history of such catastrophic events. It can’t be argued that even countries with extensive historical documents and tsunami sand deposits still have unsolved questions on the frequency of them, and the variables that control them along subduction zones. We present here preliminary results of a combined approach using historical archives and multiple proxies of the sedimentary record to unrevealing the history of possible great earthquakes and their tsunamis on the Mexican Subduction zone. The Mexican subduction zone extends over 1000 km long and little is known if the entire subduction zone along the Middle American Trench behaves as one enormous unit rather than in segments that rupture at different frequencies and with different strengths (as the short instrumental record shows). We searched on historical archives and earthquake databases to distinguish tsunamigenic events registered from the 16th century to now along the Jalisco-Colima and Guerrero-Oaxaca coastal stretches. The historical data referred are mostly from the 19th century on since the population on the coast was scarce before. We found 21 earthquakes with tsunamigenic potential, and of those 16 with doubtful to definitive accompanying tsunami on the Jalisco-Colima coast, and 31 tsunamigenic earthquakes on the Oaxaca-Guerrero coast. Evidence of great earthquakes and their tsunamis from the sedimentary record are scarce, perhaps due poor preservation of tsunami deposits in this tropical environment. Nevertheless, we have found evidence for a number of tsunamigenic events, both historical and prehistorical, 1932 and 1400 AD on Jalisco, and 3400 BP, 1789 AD, 1979 ad, and 1985 AD on Guerrero-Oaxaca. We continue working and a number of events are still to be dated. This work would aid in elucidating the history of earthquakes and tsunamis on the Mexican subduction zone.",

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Ruff (1989, Pure and Applied Geophysics, v. 129) proposed that thick or excess sediment entering the subduction zone (SZ) smooths and strengthens the trench-parallel distribution of interplate coupling strength. This circumstance was conjectured to favor rupture continuation and the generation interplate thrusts (IPTs) of magnitude >Mw8.2. But, statistically, the correlation of excess sediment and high magnitude IPTs was deemed “less than compelling”.\nNEW OBSERVATIONS: Using a larger and better vetted catalog of instrumental era (1899 through Jan. 2013) IPTs of magnitude Mw7.5 to 9.5 (n=176), and a far more accurate compilation of trench sediment thickness, we tested if, in fact, a compelling correlation exists between the occurrence of great IPTs and where thick (>1.0-1.5 km) vs thin (<1.0-0.5 km) sedimentary sections enter the SZ. Based on the new compilations, a statistically supported statement can be made that great megathrusts are most prone to nucleate at well-sedimented SZs. Despite the shorter (by 7500 km) global length of thick- (vs thin) sediment trenches, ~53% of all instrumental events of magnitude >Mw8.0, ~75% of events >Mw8.5, and 100% of IPTs >Mw9.0 occurred at thick-sediment trenches. No event >Mw9.0 ruptured at thin-sediment trenches, three super giant IPTs (1960 Chile Mw9.5, 1964 Alaska Mw9.2, and 2004 Sumatra Mw9.2) occurred at thick-sediment trenches. Significantly, however, large Mw8.0-9.0 events also commonly (n=23) nucleated at thin-sediment trenches. These IPTs are associated with the subduction of low-relief oceanic crust and where the debris of subduction erosion thickens the subduction channel separating the two plates.\nINFERENCES: Our new, larger, and corrected date compilations support the conjecture by Ruff (1989) that subduction of a thick section of sediment favors rupture continuation and nucleation of high magnitude Mw8.0 to 9.5 IPTs. This observation can be linked to a causative mechanism of sediment-effected lateral smoothing of interplate coupling. It is further inferred that lateral smoothing is also effected by the subduction of low-relief seafloor that in combination with subduction erosion promotes IPT events as large as Mw9.0.",

Previous paleomagnetic studies lack high-latitude, high-quality measurements and the resolution necessary to investigate the persistence of high-latitude geomagnetic field anomalies observed in the recent and historical field records, and replicated in some numerical geodynamo simulations. As part of the Time-Averaged Field Initiative (TAFI) project, lava sequences exposed in Nordurdalur (by Fljótsdalur) and Jökuldalur in eastern Iceland provide an excellent opportunity to improve high-latitude data suitable for investigating the 6-0.5 Ma TAF and paleosecular variation. These adjacent valleys, separated by 40 km, host a composite stratigraphic record of lava flows erupted from the Northern Rift Zone between 0.5 and ~6.5 Ma (one lava flow extruded every ~15-40 kyr). Hiatuses are present locally in the younger sections, at ~0.9 Ma and 2 Ma (spanning 200-400 kyr), that contain frequent hyaloclastites and sediments. In 2013, we collected a total of ~2200 cores (10-18 cores/site; mean = ~13 cores/site) from ~140 separate lava flows (165 in total) along eight stratigraphic profiles in Nordurdalur and Jökuldalur. In addition, hand samples were collected from ~70 sites to deliver new 40Ar/39Ar radiometric age determinations. We present the final results of AF- and thermal demagnetization of ~10 specimens/flow, comprising 165 (~140 distinct) paleomagnetic directions, along with updated composite litho-, chrono- and magnetostratigraphy of the exposed volcanic pile in Nordurdalur and Jökuldalur. We present the dispersion of the Arctic virtual geomagnetic poles over the last 6.5 Ma. In addition, we present a number of new IZZI paleointensity results from Jökuldalur. The geomagnetic results are compared and contrasted with other high-latitude data.",

            "abstract": "The Cassini-Huygens mission has revealed the surface of Titan in unprecedented detail. The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode on the Cassini Titan Radar Mapper is able to penetrate clouds and haze to provide high resolution (~350 m spatial resolution at best) views of the surface geology. The instrument’s other modes (altimetry, scatterometry, radiometry) also provide valuable data for interpreting the geology, as do other instruments on Cassini, in particular, the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) and the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS). Continuing the initial work described in Lopes et al. (2010, Icarus, 212, 744-750), we have established the major geomorphologic unit classes on Titan using data from flybys Ta through T92 (October 2004-July 2013). We will present the global distribution of the major classes of units and, where there are direct morphological contacts, describe how these classes of units relate to each other in terms of setting and emplacement history. The classes of units are mountainous/hummocky terrains, plains, dunes, labyrinthic terrains and lakes. The oldest classes of units are the mountainous/hummocky and the labyrinthic terrains. The mountainous/hummocky terrains consist of mountain chains and isolated radar-bright terrains. The labyrinthic terrains consist of highly incised dissected plateaux with medium radar backscatter. The plains are younger than both mountainous/hummocky and labyrinthic unit classes. Dunes and lakes are the youngest unit classes on Titan; no contact is observed between the dunes and lakes but it is likely that both processes are still active. We have identified individual features such as craters, channels, and candidate cryovolcanic features. Characterization and comparison of the properties of the unit classes and the individual features with data from radiometry, ISS, and VIMS provides information on their composition and possible provenance. We can use these correlations to also infer global distribution on regions not covered by SAR. This is particularly important as SAR data will not provide complete coverage of Titan by the end of the Cassini mission.",

            "abstract": "The Northern Embayment Lithosphere Experiment (NELE) is an EarthScope experiment designed to examine tectonic processes and lithospheric structure in the northern Mississippi embayment. The embayment is an intracontinental sedimentary basin filled with up to 1.5 km of unconsolidated Upper Cretaceous and younger sediments. The seismic experiment consists of four consecutive six-month deployments (September 2011 – October 2013) of broadband stations deployed to densify the Transportable Array (TA) grid and a single two-year deployment (July 2013 – June 2015) of 51 broadband seismometers along three linear profiles with an average station spacing of 20 km. Like the TA, the six-month stations were sampled at 40 Hz while the two-year stations are sampled at 100 Hz. To examine station quality and noise levels at each station, we have calculated probability density functions of power spectral densities (PDFPSDs) on all three components and compared to theoretical noise models. We use these calculations to examine how the noise profile changes across the embayment as a function of sediment thickness, sensor type, and installation technique. Preliminary observations on the 98 TA and 11 six-month NELE stations show that inside the embayment noise levels at periods between ~0.3 - 1.0 seconds (1 - 3 Hz) exceed the theoretical high noise model, and that many stations inside the embayment show a bifurcated signal at the same periods. Potential causes for the bifurcation, such as anthropogenic noise, local earthquakes, sediment variation and reverberations, and sensor/installation effects, will be discussed. Features observed in the noise catalog for all TA and NELE stations will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The impact of warm ocean water on ice sheet retreat and stability is a one of the primary drivers and sources of uncertainty for the rate of global sea level rise. One critical but challenging observation required to understand and model this impact is the location and extent of grounding ice sheet zones. However, existing surface topography based techniques do not directly detect the location where ocean water reaches (or breaches) grounded ice at the bed, which can significantly affect ice sheet stability.\nThe primary geophysical tool for directly observing the basal properties of ice sheets is airborne radar sounding. However, uncertainty in englacial attenuation from unknown ice temperature and chemistry can lead to erroneous interpretation of subglacial conditions from bed echo strengths alone . Recently developed analysis techniques for radar sounding data have overcome this challenge by taking advantage of information in the angular distribution of bed echo energy and joint modeling of radar returns and water routing. We have developed similar approaches to analyze the spatial pattern and character of echoes to address the problems of improved characterization of grounding zone geometry and englacial attenuation.\nThe spatial signal of the transition from an ice-bed interface to an ice-ocean interface is an increase in bed echo strength. However, rapidly changing attenuation near the grounding zone prevents the unambiguous interpretation of this signal in typical echo strength profiles and violates the assumptions of existing empirical attenuation correction techniques. We present a technique that treat bed echoes as continuous signals to take advantage of along-profile ice thickness and echo strength variations to constrain the spatial pattern of attenuation and detect the grounding zone transition.\nThe transition from an ice-bed interface to an ice-ocean interface will also result in a change in the processes that determine basal interface morphology (e.g. melt/freeze processes for floating ice vs. erosion/deformation processes for grounded ice). This morphology change will be expressed in the angular distribution and coherency of bed echo energy. We also present techniques that exploit this character of bed echoes to further improve the detection and characterization of grounding zones.",

            "abstract": "Payments for Watershed Services (PWS), Water Funds, and other payment schemes intended to increase the delivery of hydrologic ecosystem services have great potential for ensuring water resources for downstream beneficiaries while improving livelihoods for upstream residents. However, it is often ambiguous which land-management options should be promoted to enhance watershed service delivery. In many watershed investment programs, specific land covers are promoted as proxies for water service delivery. This approach is based on assumed relationships between land cover and water service outcomes. When land cover does not sufficiently describe ecosystem characteristics that affect water flow, however, desired water services may not be delivered. The use of land cover proxies is especially problematic for watershed investments in the tropics, where many projects are located, because these proxies rely on generalizations about landscape hydrology established for temperate zones. Based on an extensive review of hydrologic fluxes in the high-elevation tropics, we argue that direct management of hydrologic fluxes is a good design for achieving quantifiable results. We use case studies from sites in the Caribbean and Latin American tropics to illustrate how designers of watershed payment projects can manage hydrologic fluxes. To do so, projects must explicitly articulate the water service of interest based on the specific social setting. Projects must also explicitly account for the particulars of the geographic setting. Finally, outcomes must be assessed relative to water services delivered under an alternative land use or land cover scenario.",

            "abstract": "The possibility of lunar polar ice has been considered since suggested by Harold Urey in the 1950's, and has likely been directly detected at the north pole of Mercury by MESSENGER. That detection was based on the presence of reflectance anomalies seen by the Mercury Laser Altimeter that occurred only where models of the surface temperature allow long-duration preservation of water ice against sublimation (Paige et al., 2013; Neumann et al., 2013). Similar characteristics are seen at the poles of the Moon, though the higher lunar albedo complicates the detection. In this study we seek evidence for transient water frost on polar surfaces using data from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter.\nThe Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) measures the backscattered energy of the returning altimetric laser pulse at its wavelength of 1064 nm, and these data are used to map the reflectivity of the Moon at zero-phase angle with a photometrically uniform data set. Global maps have been produced at 4 pixels per degree (about 8 km at the equator) and 2 km resolution within 20° latitude of each pole. The zero-phase geometry is insensitive to lunar topography and enables the characterization of subtle variations in lunar albedo, even at high latitudes where such measurements are not possible with the Sun as the illumination source. We are currently searching the data set for evidence of transient surface frost by looking for changes in reflectance as a function of temperature based on the Diviner radiometer measurements and models. Thus far one candidate region has been identified, and we are refining the calibration to ensure that this and other detections are reliable.",

            "abstract": "Pine Island glacier is one of the major ice streams of the Antarctic Ice Sheet and has been experiencing dramatic changes for the past four decades. Its grounding line has been retreating at a rate of 1 km/a since 1992. It has been suggested that this retreat would not stop and that the entire basin would unground because of the geometry of its bed. The bed topography indeed controls to a large extent the behavior of the grounding line because of its reverse shape, which makes Pine Island susceptible to the Marine Ice Sheet Instability.\nUsing three model-based approaches, we analyze the bed topography of Pine Island, and any potential errors inherent in its representation. While all three approaches are based on the conservation of mass and momentum, they differ both in terms of the glaciological flow model used, and their estimation methodology. Nevertheless, all three produce similar bed corrections that suggest that the bed is several hundreds of meters below the most recent bed compilation of Bedmap-2, and has a flatter shape. We attribute the inconsistency with Bedmap-2 to noise and ambiguity in radar echograms due to the presence of crevasses, as well as large cross-over errors and sparse flight-line data in this region. This new description of the bed topography of Pine Island Glacier has vast implications for the modeling of its evolution in the coming decades. Models of the glacier are likely to exhibit more subtle amplification of retreat rate, since the bed is less steep, but may also begin to retreat more readily, since the present day discharge is greater and the ice surface elevation closer to floatation. Our results also provide guidelines for future mission deployments.",

The starting composition is a metasomatized lherzolite containing 3 wt. % H2O. Near-solidus melts and coexisting mineral phases have been characterized in experiments that span 925 to 1100 oC with melt % varying from 6 to 9 wt. %. Olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene and garnet coexist with melt over the entire interval and rutile is also present at < 1000 oC. Melt is andesitic in composition and varies from 60 wt. % SiO2 at 950 oC to 52 wt. % at 1075 oC. The Al2O3 contents of the melt are 13 to 14 wt. %, and CaO contents range from 1 and 4 wt. %. Melting is peritectic with orthopyroxene + liquid produced by melting of garnet + olivine + high-Ca pyroxene. In addition to quenched melt, we observe a quenched silicate component that is rhyolitic (>72 % SiO2) that we interpret as a precipitate from the coexisting supercritical H2O-rich vapor. Extrapolation of the measured compositional variation toward the solidus suggests that the first melt may be very SiO2 rich (i.e., granitic). We suggest that these granitic melts are the first melts of the mantle near the slab-wedge interface. As these SiO2-rich melts ascend into shallower, hotter overlying mantle, they continue to interact with the surrounding mantle and evolve in composition. These first melts may elucidate the geochemical and physical processes that accompany the beginnings of H2O flux melting.",

Changes in the physical and chemical environment of the lake due to non-indigenous species, pollution, sedimentation, turbidity and climate change altered the pelagic primary producers, so algal assessments have been valuable for tracking long-term conditions. We present a chronological account of pelagic algal assessments and some nearshore areas to summarize past and present environmental conditions in Lake Ontario. This review particularly focuses on diatom-based assessments as their fossils in sediments have revealed the combined effects of environmental insults and recovery. This review recaps the long-term trends according to three unique regions: Hamilton Harbor, the main lake basin and the Bay of Quinte. We summarize pre-European settlement, eutrophication throughout most of the 20th century, subsequent water quality improvement due to nutrient reductions and filter-feeding dreissenid colonization and contemporary pelagic, shoreline and embayment impairments. Recent pelagic phytoplankton data suggest that although phytoplankton biovolume remains stable, species composition has shifted to an increase in spring eutrophic diatoms and summer blue-green algae. Continued monitoring and evaluation of historical data will assist in understanding and responding to the natural and anthropogenic drivers of Lake Ontario’s environmental conditions. As such we have initiated a new paleolimnological investigation, supported by the Environmental Protection Agency-Great Lakes National Program Office, to reconstruct the long-term environmental history of Lake Ontario and will present preliminary results.",

            "abstract": "Biogeochemical processes controlling elemental cycling in soil are heterogeneously distributed due to its complex physical structure. The aggregate scale (mm-cm) is of particular interest due to the sharp transition in pore size between the aggregates themselves and the macropores surrounding them, which can lead to mass-transfer limitations and to chemical gradients over short distances. The objective of this study is to investigate how the coupled transport and biogeochemical processes that occur at the soil-aggregate scale affect selenium speciation and immobilization within soils.\nWe present a combined experimental and modelling study on artificial soil aggregates using a complex, but controlled, setting representative of natural systems. Circumventing byproduct accumulation and substrate exhaustion common in batchs and avoiding the poor physical analogy to soils of homogenously packed columns, our experiments mimic soils using constructed cm-scale aggregates in flow-through reactors, which results in diffusively and advectively controlled regions. A reactive transport model is used to delineate transport regimes, identify reaction zones, and estimate kinetic parameters and reaction rates at the aggregate scale.\nModel simulations showed extensive intra-aggregate, mm-scale radial variations in selenium distribution, reproducing the trends observed experimentally. Anoxic microzones developed over time within soil aggregates, both under oxic and anoxic conditions. We showed that those chemical gradients are mainly controlled by the coupling and respective importance of transport and microbial selenium reduction. Furthermore, we found that solid-phase concentrations of reduced selenium increased from the advection boundary (macropore) toward the aggregate cores, which would imply that more selenium can be sequestered in soils with larger aggregates. Simulations predict that selenium retention is positively correlated with aggregate size. Overall, this work highlights the importance of the spatial connection between reaction and transport fronts. It points out to the importance of obtaining information on transport-limited, intra-aggregate biogeochemical dynamics to better understand reactive transport of redox-sensitive species in structured soils.",

We will survey the effects of this on (1) soybean farmers, (2) cattle ranchers, (3) small-scale farm families, (4) rural non-agriculturists, including fishers, and (5) urban residents and map their roles as stakeholders. We will also conduct current water use surveys among the different stakeholder groups, accompanied by questions on desired aspects for future freshwater security to identify targets for desirable outcomes of water governance strategies. These targets, together with the information on land use drivers, water quantity and quality and predicted scenarios for global changes will be incorporated into a fully integrated and interactive geospatially oriented socio-ecological model that can serve as framework for future water governance that enhances Freshwater Security in such systems.

            "abstract": "The oxygen isotope concentration in calcite (δ18Oc) in speleothems over South America shows a distinct spatial pattern of change for the past 250,000 years orchestrated by precessional forcing. Using an isotope-enabled model (ECHAM4.6) coupled to a slab ocean model, we study how and why precession changes the climate of South America.\nTwo experiments, called the “low insolation” experiment and “high insolation” experiment, were performed with the same modern boundary conditions, but forced with the extreme minimum and maximum of Southern Hemisphere (SH) summer insolation, respectively. Differences between these two experiments (“low” minus “high”) display as a dipole pattern: less precipitation and heavier precipitation-weighted δ18O (δ18Op) along the Andes, and more precipitation and lighter δ18Op in northeastern Brazil. The differences in δ18Op are consistent with δ18Oc of speleothems, in terms of both sign and magnitude. Further analysis of the δ18O of precipitation, the δ18O of water vapor and the probability distribution function (pdf) of precipitation intensity reveals that changes in both the seasonality of precipitation and the “amount effect” contribute to the heavier δ18Op along the Andes, while the “amount effect” almost exclusively contributes to the lighter δ18Op in northeastern Brazil.\nTo identify the causes of precipitation response, three additional experiments are performed with localized albedo increase over South America and/or Africa. These show that the decrease in precipitation along the Andes is caused by cooling of South American continent, whereas the increase in precipitation over northeastern Brazil is associated with cooling of northern Africa. Reduction of SH summer insolation cools both South America and northern Africa. Cooling of South America weakens the South American summer monsoon (SASM) and changes the pdf of precipitation intensity over tropical South America and along the Andes; contrary to previous suggestions, changes in the strength of SASM does not account for the increase in precipitation over northeastern Brazil. Instead, the cooling of northern Africa intensifies the northeasterly trades south of the equator over the Atlantic, intensifying moisture convergence and hence precipitation over northeastern Brazil.",

            "abstract": "Near-surface wind predictions are important for a number of applications, including transport and dispersion, wind energy forecasting, and wildfire behavior. Researchers and forecasters would benefit from a wind model that could be readily applied to complex terrain for use in these various disciplines. Unfortunately, near-surface winds in complex terrain are not handled well by traditional modeling approaches. Numerical weather prediction models employ coarse horizontal resolutions which do not adequately resolve sub-grid terrain features important to the surface flow. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models are increasingly being applied to simulate atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) flows, especially in wind energy applications; however, the standard functionality provided in commercial CFD models is not suitable for ABL flows. Appropriate CFD modeling in the ABL requires modification of empirically-derived wall function parameters and boundary conditions to avoid erroneous streamwise gradients due to inconsistences between inlet profiles and specified boundary conditions. This work presents a new version of a near-surface wind model for complex terrain called WindNinja. The new version of WindNinja offers two options for flow simulations: 1) the native, fast-running mass-consistent method available in previous model versions and 2) a CFD approach based on the OpenFOAM modeling framework and optimized for ABL flows. The model is described and evaluations of predictions with surface wind data collected from two recent field campaigns in complex terrain are presented. A comparison of predictions from the native mass-consistent method and the new CFD method is also provided.",

This model reproduces the observed seasonal cycle of the ice cover and it is to this that stochastic noise--representing high frequency variability--is introduced.\nThe model takes the form of a single periodic non-autonomous stochastic ordinary differential equation. The value of such a model is that it provides a relatively simple framework to examine the role of noise in the basic nonlinear interactions at play as transitions in the state of the ice cover (e.g., from perennial to seasonal) are approached. Moreover, the stability and the noise conspire to underlie the inter annual variability and how that variability changes as one approaches the deterministic bifurcations in the system.",

            "abstract": "Since FWI was studied under the least-square misfit optimization proposed by Tarantola (1984) in time domain, it has been greatly improved by many researchers. Pratt (1998) developed FWI in frequency domain using a Gauss-Newton optimization. In recent years, FWI has been widely studied under the framework of adjoint-state methods, as summarized by Plessix (2006).\nPreconditioning and high order gradients are important for FWI. Many researches have focused on the Newton optimization, in which the calculation of inverse Hessian is the key problem. Pseudo Hessian such as the diagonal Hessian was firstly used to approximate inverse Hessian (Choi & Shin, 2007). Then Gauss-Newton or l-BFGS method was widely studied to iteratively calculate the inverse approximate Hessian Haor full Hessian (Sheen et al., 2006). Full Hessian is the base of the exact Newton optimization. Fichtner and Trampert (2011) presented an extension of the adjoint-state method to directly compute the full Hessian; Métivier et al. (2012) proposed a general second-order adjoint-state formula for Hessian-vector product to tackle Gauss-Newton and exact Newton.\nLiu et al. (2014) proposed a matrix-decomposition FWI (MDFWI) based on Born kernel. They used the Born Fréchet kernel to explicitly calculate the gradient of the objective function through matrix decomposition, no full Fréchet kernel being stored in memory beforehand. However, they didn’t give a method to calculate the Gauss-Newton. In this paper, We propose a method based on Born Fréchet kernel to calculate the Gauss-Newton for acoustic full waveform inversion (FWI). The Gauss-Newton is iteratively constructed without needing to store the huge approximate Hessian (Ha) or Fréchet kernel beforehand, and the inverse of Ha is not need to be calculated either. This procedure can be efficiently accomplished through matrix decomposition. More resolved result and faster convergence are obtained when this Gauss-Newton is applied in FWI based on the Born Fréchet kernel in 2D numerical experiments. This Gauss-Newton FWI need much less computation than adjoint-state FWI when source-station number is more than only a few percent of the receiver-station number. Such condition is common in controlled source exploration, OBS exploration, natural seismology, and even some certain seismic exploration.",

            "abstract": "Understanding particle acceleration in the magnetotail during substorms requires knowledge of changes in the global magnetospheric configuration and the local fields and micro-instabilities caused by processes associated with reconnection. To understand global structure of the magnetotail during substorms we use the UCLA global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation code and to understand local dynamics we couple the MHD simulation with the iPIC3D implicit particle-in-cell code. The MHD code provides realistic initial and boundary conditions for the iPIC3D code which models the reconnection and evolution of the substorm dipolarization front (DF) self-consistently with full kinetic physics. In the first case study we use a two dimensional version of iPIC3D to investigate the multi-scale nature of the electron energization during a substorm on February 15, 2008. In this multi-scale simulation the electric and magnetic fields show the quadrupolar signature of Hall-MHD, absent in the resistive MHD case. We note that during this event, just like in the case of the MHD, dipolarization fronts are formed mainly earthward of the neutral line. In the PIC simulation after a few seconds an active X-point forms and DF-like structures form about every two seconds and propagate earthward. The presence of the macroscopic scale magnetic field, featuring a significant dipolar component nearer the Earth affects the reconnection process causing the production of multiple repeating DFs. The electrons are preferentially accelerated in the separatrices and reach energies of 100 keV or more. This acceleration of the plasma associated with the DFs is greater than that occurring near the X-point for this substorm. We have extended this study to three dimensions since it is known that DFs develop 3D structures. Compared to 2D simulations conducted in a meridian plane (GSM XZ coordinates) important additional aspects are present when the GSM Y coordinate is included, e.g., the flapping and bending of the current layer, the development of instabilities such as ballooning, lower hybrid drift and interchange instabilities.",

            "abstract": "Hundreds of submarine landslides were detected by a network of moored hydrophones near the erupting West Mata submarine volcano during a five month deployment in 2010-2011. The landslides are identifiable by their spectral characteristics, including a low frequency onset and extended broadband coda. All hydroacoustic signals at West Mata exhibit spectral banding due to interference of direct and surface-reflected waves (the Lloyd’s Mirror effect), but in landslide signals the bands change frequency over the duration of the signal. This shows that the source is propagating, and the timing between direct and reflected arrivals is changing. We use the change in spectral content to estimate source and terminus depths and average propagation velocity. Landslides were only weakly recorded on a hydrophone to the south of West Mata suggesting that the events took place on the volcano’s north flank, a region known from bathymetric mapping to have experienced significant mass wasting. We propose that the few landslides that did not exhibit spectral banding failed over a large source area and depth range and represent the largest West Mata slides. West Mata landslides occurred frequently during the eruption, suggesting that they may be triggered by loading of fragmental material on the volcano’s flanks. While the slides occurred throughout the duration of the deployment, events tend to cluster in time, possibly indicating sequential or retrogressive failures.",

            "abstract": "Chemical and stable isotope compositions of natural gases are key parameters for characterizing gas and hydrocarbon reservoirs. Produced gases were obtained from eight wells at multi-well pad sites located in the Horn River Basin (HRB), NE British Columbia. Shale gas wells were drilled and completed in the Devonian Muskwa, Otter Park and Evie Formations of the HRB, and gases collected as time series over short term (~50 days) and long term periods (~ 1250 days).\nδ13C of gases from HRB formations confirm high thermal maturity and the shale gases frequently showed partial or full isotope reversals among hydrocarbon components. A 10‰ variation in δ13C values of methane was observed during production. In general, during early phases of production shale gases appear enriched in 12C compared to gases sampled at later stages and δ13Cmethane values were approximately between -38‰ and -35‰ during times up to 50 days. The majority of cases of carbon isotope reversals between methane and ethane components of gases (δ13Cmethane > δ13Cethane) were observed at times greater than 100 days, while ethane and propane reversals were common throughout production.\nGas production rates differed significantly among the sampled wells from ~ 50 to 400 e3m3/d. Higher rates were frequently associated with gases showing 12Cmethane enrichment. Subsequent to periods of well ‘shut in’ a change in the carbon isotope composition was detected with enrichment in 13Cmethane of gases. Carbon isotope signatures of produced gases likely reflect a combination of both the in-situ shale gas isotope signature as well as effects of isotope fractionation which may occur during transport through pores and fractures of the shale.",

            "abstract": "The Rapid Access Ice Drill (RAID) will penetrate the Antarctic ice sheets in order to core through deep ice, the glacial bed, and into bedrock below. This new technology will provide a critical first look at the interface between major ice caps and their subglacial geology. Currently in construction, RAID is a mobile drilling system capable of making several long boreholes in a single field season in Antarctica. RAID is interdisciplinary and will allow access to polar paleoclimate records in ice >1 Ma, direct observation at the base of the ice sheets, and recovery of rock cores from the ice-covered East Antarctic craton. RAID uses a diamond rock-coring system as in mineral exploration. Threaded drill-pipe with hardened metal bits will cut through ice using reverse circulation of Estisol for pressure-compensation, maintenance of temperature, and removal of ice cuttings. Near the bottom of the ice sheet, a wireline bottom-hole assembly will enable diamond coring of ice, the glacial bed, and bedrock below. Once complete, boreholes will be kept open with fluid, capped, and made available for future down-hole measurement of thermal gradient, heat flow, ice chronology, and ice deformation. RAID will also sample for extremophile microorganisms. RAID is designed to penetrate up to 3,300 meters of ice and take sample cores in less than 200 hours. This rapid performance will allow completion of a borehole in about 10 days before moving to the next drilling site. RAID is unique because it can provide fast borehole access through thick ice; take short ice cores for paleoclimate study; sample the glacial bed to determine ice-flow conditions; take cores of subglacial bedrock for age dating and crustal history; and create boreholes for use as an observatory in the ice sheets. Together, the rapid drilling capability and mobility of the drilling system, along with ice-penetrating imaging methods, will provide a unique 3D picture of the interior Antarctic ice sheets.",

            "abstract": "The inherent instabilities in two-phase displacements play a key role in the process of carbon dioxide sequestration. Thus, a fundamental understanding of two-phase unstable flows in porous media across a range of length and time scales is essential. However, the dynamics at the pore scale remains relatively unknown and influences macroscale behaviors. In that context, experiments in simplified porous media were performed in order to investigate pore scale mechanisms. The dynamics of fluid displacement in porous media were captured with Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV).\nThe experimental apparatus includes 2D etched micromodels connected to a syringe pump and placed under a microscope for flow visualization. The micromodels contain an etched flow pattern composed of circular grains homogeneously distributed or composed of a sandstone replica pattern. The fluids under study are seeded with polymer microparticles and image sequences of the flow are recorded. The motion of the seeding particles is used to calculate the velocity field of the flow with PIV algortithms.\nThe PIV measurements were first validated for single phase flow. For that purpose, experiments were performed where water and microparticles flowed through the micromodels. The PIV measurements were compared to 2D direct numerical simulations of the flow through the different geometries under consideration. Experiments and numerical simulations show a good agreement. PIV measurements are quantitatively validated to investigate flow mechanisms at the pore scale. Then, the feasibility of PIV measurements for two-phase flow in micromodels has been demonstrated and we can now use this technique with confidence to investigate multiphase flow dynamics. Experiments in micromodels will henceforth allow the validation of two-phase flow simulation, in fact no reliable numerical works have been published at this scale for multiphase flows.",
